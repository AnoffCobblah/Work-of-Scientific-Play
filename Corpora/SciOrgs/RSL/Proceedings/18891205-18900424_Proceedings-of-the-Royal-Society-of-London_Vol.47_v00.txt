tigations having been suggested by Professor Kundt. Experiments on
the rotation of the plane of polarisation of light by means ofinterrupted
currents, like those of Bichat and Blondlot, are here excluded. Since
the above-mentioned papers have not been noticed by Mr. Ward,
and are hence probably not well known, it may be of interest to re
produce here their essential contents.
    Gouy shows that in a body, which at the same time has the power
of double refraction and of rotation, certain vibrations, to which
                          " privilegiees," are
he gives the name                                 propagated unaltered. These
vibrations play exactly         the   same part in such bodies as the linear
components in, and normal to, the principal section in the case of
ordinary doubly refracting bodies, and as Fresuel's two circular com
ponents in the case of ordinary rotating bodies.              In bodies which at
the same time have the power of double refraction and of rotation, these
two privileged components of vibration take place in opposite direc
tions in two ellipses, whose major axes are one in the plane of prin
cipal section and the other perpendicular to it. The ratio of the axes
and the difference of phase of the components are calculated by Gouy
from the constants of double refraction and rotation.
    For the complete solution of the problem of the propagation of
light in such a body we only require to resolve any incident vibration
into its two privileged components, and to compound them to a single
resultant on emergence. The solution of this problem is contained in
the above paper by Wiener, which was intended to supply the theore
tical foundation for Wedding's investigation. It was especially im
portant to determine how the rotation, due to the rotational power of
the body, is disturbed by double refraction. It was found that the
rotation alters periodically with the thickness of the plate, and with
strong double refraction may even become negative, that is to say, in
the opposite direction to that due to the rotational power.               The rota
tion is zero in the neighbourhood of those places where the difference
of phase of the linear components, due to double refraction, is a
 multiple of v, and not, as Mr. Ward thinks, of w/2. The general
 result of Wiener's paper may be quoted as follows : —
    " Herrscht bei der gleichzeitigen Wirkung von Circularpolarisation*
 nnd Doppelbrechung die eine vor, so wird die andere theilweise
 verdeckt. Eine starke Doppelbrechung driickt die Drehung der
 Circularpolarisation und eine starke Circularpolarisation das Ellip.
 tischmachen der Doppelbrechung herab."
    Wedding's investigation is of purely experimental nature, and
 consists of two parts.          The first is occupied with magnetic rotation
 in stressed glass, and completely confirms by experiment the con-
    * By " Circularpolarisation   " is understood what we have here called  rotational
 power.

     1889.]   Rotation   of the Plane of Polarisation of Light.                3
 elusions of the  theory, especially with regard to zero and negative
  rotation.  It concludes with the words :
     "Ebenso darf man bei Krystallen, an denen man keine elektro-
  magnetische   Drehung beobachten kann, nicht den Schluss ziehen,
  dass ihnen keine Verdet'sche Constante zukame, weil eine vorhandene
  Drehnng durch die superponirte Doppelbrechung geschwiicht wird
  and bis zur Unmerklichkeit verdeckt werden knnn."
     In the second part he communicates the repetition of Villari's
  experiment on the rotation of the plane of polarisation of light in a
 disk spinning between magnet poles.      He finds a diminution of rota
 tion from 5-06° to 0'77° when the disk spins 10,800 times in a
 minute, and proves experimentally that this is due to the double
 refraction produced by centrifugal force.     For, on the one hand, the
 doable refraction produces a difference of phase in the linear com
 ponents, which, like the centrifugal force, is proportional to the
square of the number of revolutions, and hence must be due to this
force; on the other hand, the rotation vanishes as the theory
 requires, just where the difference of phase of the linear components
is t.
    Thus Mr. Ward's essential results, namely, the diminution of the
rotation by double refraction, and the explanation of Villari's experi
ment by means of the double refraction due to centrifugal force, have
been  already communicated in the above-named papers.
   With regard to Mr. Ward's mathematical deductions, the first of
the before-mentioned authors wishes to point ont a mistake which
 Mr. Ward has made in forming his differential equation.
   In accordance with Mr. Ward, we let the x or y axis fall in the
plane of principal section, and the z axis in the direction of the rays
of light.   We must examine how an ellipse is altered under the
common action of rotation and double refraction, if we advance in
the medium a short distance dz.    Like Mr. Ward, we take the ellipse
as produced by composition of y and z components,    the ratio of whose
amplitudes is tan a,  and   whose  difference of phase is 3 ; then the
direction of the major axis forma with the x axis an angle w, deter
mined by the equation

   So far our calculation agrees with Mr. Ward's.
   To continue : let p vary under the influence of double refraction
alone hy 3/3i = k dz, when the vibration advances through dz ; then
the alteration of w is dm = — \k sin 4a, tan p dz.

the total alteration of « with z is given by the equation —

     In this equation p is still unknown ; it is also variable with the
double  refraction   and with the rotation. We must therefore form a

   For some time past I have been engaged in the study of some deri
vatives of camphor, with the view of determining, if possible, with
some degree of certainty the constitution of that body.        I do not pro
pose to enter now into any account of the present state of our know
ledge as to the chemistry of camphor, but at once to bring forward
something of my own experience on this subject.
    Of part of the results which I havo obtained            I  gave a brief
account at the meeting of the British Association last year at Bath.
This account had reference chiefly to some further evidence of the
relationship of camphor to hexahydrometaxylene, and to the products
of oxidation of camphoric acid by means of an alkaline solution of

are not even yet completed.
                        I
    On the other hand, have made some additional experiments which
I am anxious to bring forward now, as it may be some time before
the whole series is finished.
    The experiments to be described have reference to certain pro
cesses which resulted in the preparation of a new camphoric acid ;
and the remarkable properties of this acid contrasted with those
of the ordinary camphoric acid throw considerable light on the
nature of the isomerism subsisting between these bodies.
                            Camphoryl   Chloride.
    I  have had occasion   to prepare    considerable  quantities of cani-
phoryl chloride, C10HU02C12, by the action of pentachloride of phos
phorus on ordinary camphoric acid. Camphoryl chloride was obtained
originally by Moitessier (' Compt. Rend.,' vol. 52, p. 871), but only
as a crude product, which he found to decompose on distillation.        The
substance may, however, be readily purified by distillation in vacuo,
when it distils about 140° C. under 15 mm. pressure.          There appears
to be no difference in the product of the reaction however much penta
chloride of phosphorus is used, provided the temperature be not.
raised above that of boiling water.
                         Chlorocamphoryl   Chloride.
   If, however, camphoric acid    is heated  with a large excess of penta
chloride of phosphorus on a sand-bath in a flask provided with a
reflux condenser, a new body of the formula C10H13Cl3O2, viz., chloro

camphoryl chloride, is obtained. A further account of this body and
 its transformations   I  will reserve for a future publication.
    The camphoryl chloride was prepared in order to attempt to reduce
it to the lactone similar to the lactones obtainable from phthalyl and
succinyl chlorides.       It  was not found possible to obtain a lactone
 under the various        conditions of experiment from time to time
adopted.
                  Action of Water     on Camphoryl    Chloride.
    Circumstances, however, led to the consideration of a more simple
reaction,    namely,    the action of water on camphoryl chloride.
Moitessier had stated that this reaction was such as to give back
camphoric acid.      He means, presumably, the original dextro-rotatory
acid, as he does not mention more than one.               This acid is, in fact,
formed, as will be shown subsequently, but only in very small quan
tity, and can only be separated from and recognised among the other
products of the reaction after special treatment.
    If camphoryl chloride obtained from ordinary dextro-camphoric
acid is added gradually to about ten times its weight of hot water,
there is formed about equal quantities of camphoric anhydride and a
new camphoric acid, which rotates the ray of polarised light to the
left.   These two bodies are contained in the precipitate after cooling,
and form by far the greater part of the product.           Besides these, there
is formed a small quantity of another substance more soluble in water,
which separates from a strong hot aqueous solution as an oil, after a
time solidifying.     This is a mixture of the ordinary dextro-camphoric
acid with the new laevo-rotatory          acid.    I will refer to this again
later.
    The camphoric anhydride and lsevo-camphoric acid obtained in thi'
reaction are readily separated by treatment with carbonate of soda it
the cold, by means of which the laevo-acid is dissolved, leaving tho
anhydride untouched.         This anhydride is converted into the ordinary
dextro-rotatory camphoric acid by solution in hot caustio soda and
precipitation by hydrochloric acid.         I  have been able to confirm de
Montgolfier's   observation    that  the camphoric acid obtained from the
anhydride has a specific rotatory power of over + 48°.            I have found
[a]D = +48-25°.        (The determinations of rotatory power have been
made throughout with a Laurent half-shade polarimeter, kindly lest
me by Dr. Haldane, of the Physiological Department.)
                   Properties of   the Lcevo-camphoric   Acid.
    The lsevo-rotatory acid obtained above has a rotation about equal,
and of opposite sign to the dextro-acid.        I have found [a]D = — 48'09°.
I   am convinced, however, that these two acids are not optically

opposite    isomers,   in the sense namely in which dextro- and laevo-
tartaric acids are regarded as optically opposite.
    In its ordinary properties the lsevo-acid differs markedly from the
 dextro-isomer.      It has a lower melting point, namely, 170° C., as
 compared with 185 C°.         Again it yields a very soluble amorphous
 barium salt, the corresponding salt of the dextro-acid being also
indeed very soluble but crystalline.       A more remarkable distinction,
however, is that the lsevo-acid appears to have no corresponding
anhydride.       When subjected to the action of acetyl chloride, an
important reagent employed by Anschutz for obtaining the anhy
 drides of dibasic acids, the dextro-acid readily and practically quanti
tatively yields its anhydride, which is insoluble in carbonate of soda.
The lsevo-acid, on the other hand, when treated in the same manner,
yields a product almost completely soluble in carbonate of soda, from
 which the original acid of melting point 170° is recovered apparently
unaltered.
                Conversion of the Lcevo- into the Dextro-Acid.
    If, however, the hevo-acid      be distilled,  it boils about 294° C,
j-ielding the anhydride of the ordinary dextro-camphoric acid, from
which anhydride this acid may be obtained in the ordinary way.
    Thus it appears possible to convert any quantity of the dextro-acid
almost entirely into the lsevo- through the intervention of the chloride,
and any quantity of the laevo- back again to the dextro- by means of
the anhydride.
                            Mixture of the two Acids.
    Chautard obtained a lsevo-camphoric acid by the oxidation of a
 tevo-rotatory camphor.       This acid is described as possessing all the
 properties   of ordinary camphoric acid, except that its rotatory power
 is of opposite sign. Further, when strong alcoholic solutions of the
 two acids are mixed there is a precipitation of crystals and a rise of
 temperature in the liquid.
    The laevo-acid which     I  have obtained differs from Chautard's in
 other properties, and also in this, that when mixed with the dextro-
 acid in equal quantities in strong alcoholic solution there is no
 crystalline deposit and no rise of temperature.
     On boiling down the alcoholic solution, a .syrupy residue is left,
 which dissolves in hot water more readily apparently than either of
 its constituents. From the aqueous solution it separates partly as an
oil, which after a time solidifies, and partly as crystals. Neither the
solidified oil nor the crystals have a definite melting point, but both
melt at a lower temperature than either of the component acids.
Hence the two acids do not appear to form any definite compound
camphoric acid..

                         Separation   of the Mixed Acids.
      Anschutz's  acetyl   chloride reaction furnishes a particularly neat
  method of separating the two acids.          The anhydride of the dextro-
  acid formed by the action of the acetyl chloride is separated from the
  apparently unaltered laevo-acid by treatment with carbonate of soda,
  which dissolves only the latter.
      Nature of the more soluble Syrupy Product of the Action of Water
                             on Camphoryl     Chloride.
      This substance, which resembled the mixture of dextro- and laevo-
  acids above described,    was subjected. to the same process of separation,
  by which exactly the same products were obtained.
     Thus the action of water on the acid chloride is such as to give
 about equal    quantities of laevo-camphoric acid and the anhydride of
 dextro-camphoric acid, a small portion of latter being further converted
 into the acid.
     Optical Activity of Camphoryl Chloride and Camphoric        Anhydride.
     It might be supposed, from the circumstances        just mentioned, that
 camphoryl chloride which yields           both dextro- and lsevo-camphoric
 acids would be    itself inactive. This, however, is not the case.      I have
 always found camphoryl chloride to be lsevo-rotatory, though I have
 not found a perfectly constant number to express its value.           For the
 undiluted substance I have found [*]D = —30°, and                — 3"6°, while
 for the substance      dissolved in crude benzene the rotation is about
 twice as much, viz., [a]D = — 7'1° and — 8'3° ; the latter value being
 obtained with the same specimen of camphoryl chloride which gave a
 rotation of 3"6° when undiluted.        The rotation is, indeed, greater than
 that of camphoric anhydride, a substance which yields only one cam
phoric acid. I have found the specific rotation of camphoric anhydride
in pure benzene to be —3' 7°, and very little different in the same
benzene which was employed for the camphoryl              hloride. De Mont-
golher has given a higher value, — 7° 7', for camphoric anhydride,
which     I am unable to confirm.
                            Theoretical  Considerations.
    If   we wish    to interpret rightly the foregoing facts, we shall, 1
think, find it impossible to regard the tevo-camphoric acid as the
optically opposite isomer of the ordinary acid.           On the other hand,
there    would appear to    be a  probability, almost amounting to certainty,
that these two acids are related to one another as maleic and fumaric
acids,    the dextro-camphoric acid corresponding to maleic and the
Uevo- to    fumaric acid. The isomerism is further complicated by the
presence of rotatory power which requires the existence of two other

10                 Mr. J.  E. Marsh.    Researches  on the        [Dec. 5,
isomers which shall be the optically opposite      isomers  of these two.
In this latter case, therefore, the two acids     will also be related, as
inaleic and fumaric acids, but the laevo-acid will correspond to malei0c
and the dextro- to fumaric.        This laevo-camphoric acid is without
doubt the acid which Chautard obtained by the oxidation of lsevo-
 camphor, and the fumaroid dextro-acid       I hope to obtain from it by
 the hydrolysis of the acid chloride.
    Now, accepting. uureservedly Vau't Hoff's carbon-atom hypothesis,
 we find that the isomerism of the camphoric acids is not explained by
 different structural formulae, but rather by one and the same structural
 formula, admitting of at least four different arrangements of the
 atoms in space.     There will be then two conditions attached to such
 a structural formula : (1) Either it will contain two doubly-linked
 carbon-atoms, each of them being united to two different groups, and
 one of these groups containing also an asymmetric carbon-atom ; (2)
 or the formula may consist of a closed chain of carbon-atoms, of which
 two or more are asymmetric. In tho latter case, it is necessaiy to
  mention a further restriction, namely, that when there are only two
 asymmetric carbon-atoms in the ring, there must not be symmetry in
 the formula, or, in other words, the image of neither isomer must be
 identical with its object (see ' Phil. Mag.,' 1888, vol. 26, p. 426).   It
  is the more necessary to mention this restriction as it applies to
 Wreden's formula, a formula which does not admit of rotatory power
 in the male'inoid acid, that is, in the ordinary camphoric acid.
     Turning now to some of the formulae proposed for camphoric acid
 by different chemists, we find that in general they satisfy one or other
 of the conditions before mentioned. But Kekule's formula, which
  fulfils the first condition, and Kachler's, which satisfies the second,
  cannot bo accepted, on the ground that they do not represent cam
  phoric acid as a derivative of hoxahydrometaxylene.            Wreden's
  formula which does thus represent camphoric acid does not, as I have
  just mentioned, satisfy the restricted second condition. Armstrong's
  formulse satisfy the second condition, and also represent camphoric
  acid as a derivative of hexahydrometaxylene, but Armstrong's for
  mulse appear to me liable to objection on the ground of the formula
  for camphor from which they are derived. These formulse represent
  camphor either as not containing a ketonic group, or if it contain a
  ketonic group as coutaining also a closed chain of four carbon-atoms.
   Now, we know no instances of stable rings of four carbon-atoms,        if
  indeed we know instances of such rings at all ; and it is unlikely that
  camphor is the one exception to what may be regarded as a general rule.
     The formulse which I have proposed for camphor and camphoric
  acid appear to be opposed by no facts, and also explain perfectly the
  isomerism of the camphoric acids.       Camphor is represented by the
  formula  —

tinguish the hydroterephthalic acids.    Ordinary camphoric acid then
is dextro- and Chautard's acid laevo-ciscamphoric acid, the prefix c 7
indicating that the carboxylic groups are on the same side of the ring
plane.
   The new acid again, which I have described in this paper, is the
laevo- and the acid yet to be discovered will be the dextro-transcam-
phoric acid, the prefix trans implying that the groups which govern
the isomerism are on opposite sides of the ring plane.
   It will be noticed that the formulae which I have adopted require
the existence of another series of two camphors (dextro- and laevo-}
and four camphoric acids ; but of the existence of these we have as
yet no evidence.
   [Postscript, Dec. 2nd, 1889. — Since the above was written, my
uttontion has been drawn to a paper by M. Friedel in the ' Comptes

acid.   This laevo-acid appears to be the same as the one I have just
described, and the mesocamphoric acid to be a mixture of the laevo-
 with the original dextro-acid. Thus mesocamphoric acid must no

     The author has already    studied the internal friction of metals by
 the method of torsional oscillations, and deduced certain simple laws
 relating thereto.    One of the principal objects of the present enquiry
 was to ascertain bow far the dissipation of energy resulting from
statical molecular friction which occurs in magnetic cycles of very
 minnte range would be amenable to the laws of dissipation of energy

occurring in torsional cycles.                           method of observa
tion has been employed, the arrangements being exceedingly sensitive
so as to admit of the use of very feeble magnetising forces.
    The following is a summary of the results obtained : —
    1. When a rod of iron, nickel, or cobalt is made to pass through a
complete magnetic cycle of sufficiently minute range of magnetising
force, the changes of magnetic         induction can bo expressed by an
 equation of the form —
                                  y = Ax+Bx*,
 where   x represents the change       of magnetising force as the force
 passes  from its greatest value in the cycle to zero, if the force be
 always applied in the same direction, or as the force passes from its
 greatest value in the one direction to its greatest value in the opposite
 direction, if the force be alternately applied in one direction and in
 the opposite,     y represents the corresponding change of magnetic
 induction, and A and B are constants throughout the cycle.
    2. The values of A and B are the same for magnetic cycles of
 different ranges of magnetising force, provided the force does not
 eiceed certain limits. These limits vary considerably with the nature
of the metal and with the mechanical or thermal treatment to which
it may have been subjected.
    3. The constant A is a measure of the magnetic permeability of
the metal when the magnetising force is infinitesimal.            The product
of B and the cube of the maximum force in the cycle is a measure of

 be largely aided by repeatedly raising the metal to 100" C. and then
 allowing it to cool.
    6. The "accommodation"         of the molecules of iron, nickel, and
cobalt is disturbed by very slight mechanical shocks, by small change
of temperature, or by magnetisation beyond certain limits ; under
such influences the internal friction may for a time, or even per
 manently, be considerably increased.
    7. The values of A and B for iron, nickel, and cobalt can be very
 largely decreased by permanent mechanical strain. They may also-
 be largely decreased in the case of steel by sudden cooling from a
high temperature. No amount of strain, however, whether produced
by mechanical or thermal agency, can reduce either the magnetic
permeability or the internal friction below certain limits.
    8. The values of A and B for iron are temporarily increased by
 loading not carried beyond a certain limit ; beyond this limit both A
and B decrease with increase of load.
    9. The values of A and B for iron, nickel, and cobalt are temporarily
increased when the temperature is raised from 0° C. to 100° C.
    The amount of increase is much greater in freshly-annealed iron
 wire than in the same wire after it has been repeatedly raised to
 100° C. and then cooled.
    10. In both torsional and magnetic cycles of sufficiently minute
range, the dissipation of energy from internal friction is independent
of the rate at which the cycle is performed.
    11. In both torsional and magnetic cycles of given range of force
the average dissipation of energy per cubic centimetre does not
depend upon the dimensions, provided that in magnetic cycles the
length is sufficiently great to permit of neglecting the effect of the ends.
    12. It follows from 3 that the dissipation of energy in a magnetic
cycle is proportional to the cube of the maximum magnetising force
in the cycle. On the contrary, the dissipation of energy in a torsional
cycle is proportional to the square of the maximum torsional force
provided the force does not exceed certain limits.
    13. Ar regards "accommodating"          influences and also as regards
those influences which disturb
                                    " accommodation," the dissipation of
energy in a magnetic cycle seems to be strictly analogous to the
dissipation of energy in a torsional cycle.        But the temporary and
permanent effects of mechanical stress and the temporary effects of
change of temperature are very different in the two kinds of cycles.

    The idea of employing a wedge of neutral-tinted glass as a photo
 meter has occurred to many observers — Dawes, Captain Abney, and
 others— and notably of late years to Professor Pritchard, of Oxford,
 who has produced with such an instrument his well known
                                                                            '
                                                                              Urano-
 metria Nova Oxoniensis,' a catalogue of the relative brightness of the
 brighter stars north of the equator.            But the nse of such an instru
ment has always been limited hitherto to the comparison of the rela
 tive intensities of such points of light as the stars present, its
 employment upon objects of sensible area being foreign to the ideas
 and   requirements proposed in its construction.                    Having, how
 ever, attempted         to use a photometer of this description upon
 disks of small but of various areas illuminated by a known amount
 of light, the discordances of the results forced upon me the necessity
of modifying the construction of the photometer in a way which I
 believe will extend its sphere of usefulness.                It is not within the
scope    of  this   paper   to  give any   detailed   account   of the many experi
ments     I  have made with several wedges, but it is sufficient to say
that the wedge-form itself has been fully proved to be an important
factor in the production of the discordances to which reference has
been made, for the following reasons : —
    A point of light from its very definition implies that no sensible
portion of the wedge is occupied in its passage, but it requires very
little thought to perceive that when an area of sensible dimensions is
being dealt with this is by no means the case.                    Moreover, an ele
mentary        inquiry    suffices  to   point   out   that  if  the area possess a
considerable diameter the light emanating from its lateral portions
will impinge on different thicknesses of the wedge, as shown to an
exaggerated degree in fig. 1, where AB is the transverse diameter of
                                           Fig. 1.
the area, and CDEP the portion of the wedge employed.                            It is
evident     if  the  differences   in  intensity   be  required   between  two   disks

of the same diameter this condition of things wonld not affect the
validity of the final results, but it is equally apparent that were the
disks of differing diameter the values obtained could not but be
seriously affected.   Let it be presumed that two such different-sized
disks were under consecutive examination, as shown in fig. 2, AB
                                  Fig.  2.
representing the diameter of one and CD that of the other. In the
case of AB it is manifest that the extreme limb B would be fainter to
all appearance than the opposite edge A, because the light issuing from
it has to traverse a portion of the wedge EF, thicker and so more
dense than E'F'.     On consideration, it is equally obvious that the
limiting margin A will be the last to appear as the wedge is made to
move from right to left till disappearance takes place, the position
technically spoken of as
                             " the point of wedge extinction." But if
CD, the larger disk, be illuminated with light of the same initial
intensity as fell on AB, it is evident that the point of wedge extinc
tion (technically so-called) for CD at the limb C will not be at the
same wedge-reading as in the previous case ; in fact, disappearance
would not occur until the portion of the wedge corresponding to the
line E'F' had been moved to occupy the position shown by the line
E"F". Hence, when ascertaining what is termed the wedge-interval
in the direct comparison, say, of the relative intensities of a large and
small disk, it is very obvious an error entirely due to the physical
nature of a wedge must inevitably result, such error being in direct
proportion to the amount of shift required, which depends upon
the relative differences in diameter of the disks under observation.
Nothing is here said of the difficulties of observation, which are
enormously increased by the different apparent intensities of the
light at the extremities of the diameter parallel to the length of the
wedge, because I merely wish to call attention to the error resulting
from the employment of the wedge-form itself.
    To apply a correction under these circumstances was not deemed
expedient, even if found to be practically possible ; hence the removal
of the source of error has been arrived at by devising an instrument of

     description : —
       Two very thin wedges of neutral-tinted glass are made to
                                                                           slide
    past one another with a uniform rate of motion by the
                                                                  turning of a
    single milled-headed screw, the idea of the arrangement
                                                                     being dia-
    grammatically set forth, so far as the wedges themselves are concerned,
    in fig. 3, where   it will    be seen  that any amount of density, within
                                          Fio. 3.
  certain   limits, can      be obtained by equal movement of the two
  wedges, although      a  uniformly absorptive area in all parts of the field
  is rigidly maintained.         In the figure, ABC is shown as one wedge,
  DEF the other, and VIEW the field of view. A cursory inspection
  of the arrangement at once reveals its most salient advantages, and
  the fact    that any sized disk within the limits of the field of vision
  will be obscured by the same density of neutral- tinted glass at any
  and all parts of its image, and hence that the cause of error spoken
 of as arising from the use of a single wedge is at once removed.
     An instrument so constructed has been subjected to several months'
 crucial testing, and      I  have no gronndslfor thinking it does not fulfil
 the requirement for which it was devised.             In its final form the
arrangement        differs  from    that usually! met with as suggested by
Professor Pritchard, for it is supplied with a rotating disk of
metal, perforated at intervals to allow the permanent insertion of
pieces of neutral-tinted glass of different thickness, each of which
can be evaluated for magnitude and used as a constant. Besides, it is

                                      (Abstract.)
     After  historical introduction the authors proceed to describe the
              a
method    of investigation, which was conducted as follows. The
 animal being narcotised with ether, the internal capsule was exposed
by
a    horizontal section through the hemisphere.       By means of com
passes the outlines of the basal ganglia and capsule were accurately
transferred to paper ruled with squares of       millimetre side, so that
                                                       1
a projection of the capsule was thus obtained, divided into bundles of
1 xnillimetre square area.    Each of these squares of fibres was then
excited by a minimal stimulus, the same being an indnced or secondary
interrupted current.     The movements were recorded and the capsule
photographed.
  In all 45 experiments           were   performed, and they are arranged in
eight groups, representing eight successive levels (i.e., from the
centrum ovale to the eras) at which the capsule was investigated.
  Before the results are described in detail a fall account  given of is
previous investigations,   experimental, clinical, and anatomical, on
the    arrangement of the internal capsule.

22       Effect  of the  Spectrum on Haloid Salts        of Silver.  [Dec. 12,
   The anatomy of the part and the relation of the fibres to the basal
ganglia are then discussed, and a full description given of each of the
groups examined.
    The general results are next given at length, of which the following
is a resume.
    Firstly, the rare occurrence of bilateral movement is discussed,
and the meaning of the phenomenon defined.                Secondly, the lateral
arrangement     and  juxtaposition   of  the fibres  are considered.   Thirdly,
the antero-posterior order in which the fibres for the movements of
the different segments are placed is described, and that order found
to be practically identical with that observed on the cortex, viz., from
before back.

                      ,,       lower limb (hip preceding toes).
    The character or nature of these movements is set out in a table
giving the average localisation of each segment.           Speaking generally,
it may be said that the movements are arranged in the same way as
has already been shown by the authors to exist in the cortex (vide
previous papers in ' Phil. Trans.,' 1887, 1888), viz., that the repre
sentation of extension is situated in front of that of flexion for the
segments of the upper limb, while for the toes flexion is obtained, as
in the cortex, in front of extension.
    Numerous tables and diagrams are appended, showing the extent
of appropriation of fibres for each movement.

      IV.    " Magnetic Properties of Alloys of Nickel and Iron." By
           J. HoPKlNSOn, D.Sc., F.R.S. Received December 2, 1889.
          Several alloys have been examined, supplied to me very kindly by
     Mr. Riley, of the Steel Company of Scotland.       I confine myself to a
     brief statement of the results with    the most interesting sample.  Mr.
     Riley informs me that this sample contains 25 per cent, of nickel.
    A_s the material was given to me it was non-magnetic at ordinary
  temperature, that is to say, the permeability was small, about 1'4,
and the induction was precisely proportional to the magnetising
force.         The ring on being heated remained non-magnetic up to
70O° C. or 800°        C   A block of the material did not recalesce on being
heated to a high        temperature  and being allowed to cool.
     On being placed in a freezing mixture the material became magnetic
 at a temperature » little below freezing point.
     The material was next cooled to about —51° C., by means of solid
.carbonic acid       and the curve of magnetisation was ascertained, as
 shown in fig. 1      corresponding to a temperature of 13° C. ; from this
  it will be seen    that   the ring of the material, which was previously
                                       Fig.  1.

24     Magnetic Properties     of Alloys of Nickel   and Iron.  [Dec. 12,
non-magnetic at 13° C, is now decidedly magnetic at the same tem
perature.    On heating the material it remained magnetic until it
reached a temperature of 580° C. At this temperature it became non
magnetic, and, on cooling, remained non-magnetic to the ordinary
temperature of the room.         Fig. 2 shows the inductions at various
                                    Fig.  2.
temperatures,   the abscissae being temperatures for a magnetising
force 6-7, whilst fig. 3 shows the induction in terms of the tempera-

ture to a different scale for a force of 64. These curves show that, for
a range of temperature from somewhat below freezing to 580° C., this
material exists in two states, either being quite stable, the one being
non-magnetic, the other magnetic.         It changes from non-magnetic to
magnetic if the temperature be reduced a little below freezing ; the
magnetic state of the material does not change from magnetic to non
magnetic till the temperature is raised to 580° C.
   The same kind of thing, in a much less degree, can be seen with
ordinary steel.    Over a small range this can exist in two states, but
in changing its state from non-magnetic to magnetic a considerable
amount of heat is liberated, which causes a rise of temperature of the
steel.   Whether any material quantity of heat is latent in the nickel
steel I do not know.

I. " Comparison of the Spectra of Nebulae and Stars of Groups
       I and II with those of Comets and Aurorse." By J. NORMAN
       Lockyer, F.R.S. Received November 9, 1889.
    The discussion of cometary spectra which was communicated to the
Royal Society in November, 1888,* contained, among other matters,
conclusions which have a special bearing on the relations of their
spectra to those of other bodies.
    I have thought it therefore desirable to bring this new material
together with the more complete lists of lines which are now avail
able in the case of other groups of celestial bodies, chiefly owing to
the observations made by my assistants and others and myself since
my paper of 1887 was written, bnt also in consequence of a more
complete search among previously recorded observations.
    Such a comparison — a much more complete one than was possible
in the first instance — would strengthen or weaken my hypothesis
according as the increased area of observation increased or decreased
the number of coincidences in the spectra of the various groups.
    The more the coincidences are intensified the greater is the proba
bility that comets, nebulae, stars with bright lines, stars with mixed
 (lutings, and the aurora have a common origin, independent of the
 chemical origins which have been assigned to the various lines by
 laboratory observations.
    In the tables which follow, the individual observations are not
 given, but under each heading all the lines or flutings which have
 been recorded find place.
                 I. Comparison      of Comets and Nebula.
    We may conveniently begin with a comparison of comets and
 nebulae.   The Great Comet of 1882 and Comet Wells, when near
 perihelion, are excluded from the list of cometary lines and flutings,
 as their temperature was too high for fair comparison with most of
 the nebulae and other low temperature phenomena.

    In  cases where any of these higher temperature lines correspond to
lines in the comparison spectrum, however, they have been added to
the list of cometary lines, in brackets, as sometimes the phenomena
compared may attain a temperature slightly higher than that of
comets at mean temperature.
    For the nebulae, all the lines recorded in the visible spectrum by
 Messrs. Huggins, Vogel, Copeland, Taylor, and Fowler are given.
 The list of lines has been considerably extended since my preliminary
 discussion of the spectra of nebulae in November, 1887.                  D3 and a
 line at 447 have been observed in the spectrum of the nebula in Orion
by Copeland, and Mr. Taylor has also recorded D3 and lines, or
remnants of flutings, at 559 and 520.              In the nebula in Andromeda,
carbon flutings and the lead flutings at 546 have been observed by
Mr. Fowler and confirmed by Mr. Taylor ; since these observations
were made,     I  find that Vogel* has observed a line at 518, probably
carbon 517, in nebulas numbered in Sir J. Herschel's General Cata
logue 4234, 4373, and 4390.
    Other nebula linos with which            I   was not previously acquainted
are 479, 509, and 554.           All these     lines were observed by Vogel in
the nebula G.C. 4378.f
    With reference to the appearance of D3 in nebulae and bright-line
stars,   I wrote, in November, 1887 $ : — "It is right that I should here
point out that some observers of bright lines in these so-called stars
have recorded a line in the yellow which they affirm to be in the
position of Ds; while, on the other hand, in my experiments on
meteorites, whether in the glow or in the air, I have seen no line
occupying this position.
    " I trust that some observer with greater optical means will think
it worth his time to make a special inquiry on this point. The argu
ments against this line indicating the spectrum of the so-called helium
are absolutely overwhelming.              The helium line so far has only been
seen in the very hottest part of the Sun which we can get at.                  It is
there associated with 6, and with lines of iron which require the
largest coil and the largest jar to bring 'them out, whereas it is stated
to have been observed in stars where the absence of iron lines and of
6 shows that the temperature            is very low.       Further, no trace of it
was seen in Nova Cygni, and it has even been recorded in a spectrum
in which C was absent, and once as the edge of a fluting. §

     " If, however, it should eventually be established that the line is

 Z>3, which probably represents a fine form of hydrogen, it can only be
 suggested that the degree of fineness which is brought about by tempera
 ture in the case of the Sun, is brought about in the spaces between
 meteorites by extreme tenuity."
    The observations of Dr. Copeland* have now, I think, established
 the identity of the yellow line, in the nebula of Orion at all events,
 with Ds. In a letter to Dr. Copeland, I suggested that the line at
447 was in all probability Lorenzoni's        /  of the chromosphere spectrum,
 seeing that it was associated both in the nebulae and chromosphere
 with hydrogen and D3.           This he believes to be very probable.            The
line makes it appearance in the chromosphere spectrum about 75 times
to 100 appearances of D3 or the lines of hydrogen.
    The association of the line at 447 with Ds therefore strengthens
the view that there is an action in space, away from condensations,
whereby matter is reduced to its finest forms.

   identical.      The flatings of hot carbon, for example, are common to
   both,   as  are also    the flntings of magnesium, manganese, and lead.
   The hydrogen line 486 has only been seen in one comet, namely,
   Comet    III,  1880, by Konkoly*
     Other flntings and lines again are special to comets and others to
   nebulae.     Thus, there are practically no indications of hydrogen in
  comets, although the hydrogen lines are amongst the brightest in
. nebula.      Again, the lines 447, 479, 495, 509, 554, and 5872 are seen
  in nebulae, but not in comets.            On the other hand, the cool carbon
  flntings    and  the  fluting at 568  are  seen in comets, but not in nebulae.
  Most of these apparent discrepancies are explained by a consideration
  of tbe differences in the conditions of comets and nebulae.                It must
  be remembered         that in the case of comets there is an action which
  repels the vapours produced by collisions, and the vapours first
  affected -will, of course, be those which are least dense.               Hydrogen
  will thus be repelled from the comets, whilst the denser vapours of
  magnesium and carbon remain.               There is then a good reason why
  hydrogen lines should not be seen in cometary spectra.                As there can
  be no such repulsion in the sparse swarms which constitute nebulae,
  hydrogen lines are seen in them.
     Two other lines special to nebulae are 5872 and 447, to which refer
  ence has already been made.             The evidence tends to show that D3
  and    /  are   finer   vapours than hydrogen, and hence there is even
  greater reason for the absence of these lines from cometary spectra,
  even were the temperature higher, than for the absence of the lines
  of hydrogen.
     The line at 527 is probably the iron line E ; this was seen in the
  hotter comets, namely, Comet Wells and the Great Comet of 1882, so
  that there is no discordance with regard to the appearance of this
  line.    The other lines special to nebulae are 479, 495, 509, and 554 ;
 but as no origins for these have yet been determined, it is not possible
 to explain their absence from cometary spectra.                It is not improbable
 that 554 is an error in measurement for the manganese fluting at 558,
  the 'latter having been recorded by Mr. Taylor in the nebula of Orion.
     [On November 25, Mr. Fowler attempted to compare this line, as
 seen in the planetary nebula G.C. 4373, with the manganese fluting,
 but the line was so faint with the 10-inch that no reliable comparison
 could be made. The line is certainly not far from the manganese
 fluting. —December 8.]
     The apparent absence of the cool carbon flntings from nebulae is in
all probability due to insufficient observations, as indicated by the
discussion of comets.           The lowest temperature (magnesium) and the
hot carbon stages of comets are both represented in nebulae, and the
                            • O'Gyalla Observations, 1881, p. 5.

 intermediate cool carbon stage is therefore not likely to be entirely
 absent.
    The absence of the hot carbon fluting at 564 from the spectra of
 nebulae may possibly be due to two causes.                  It is much fainter than
 either 517 or 468-474, and may have escaped notice on that account ;
or, as in the nebula in Andromeda, it may be masked in the same way
as   in comets.
    It is suggested that the ordinary nebula) are not hot enough to give
the line or fluting at 568, but it appears when the swarms become
more condensed, that is, in bright-line stars.               The absence of 568 is
therefore probably due to the low temperature of                 nebulae.

    If we exclude the exceptional cases of Comet Wells and the Great
Comet of 1882, the number of lines and flutings recorded in comets
is small, and therefore only the most general list of auroral lines
must be taken for comparison. It would be unfair, for example, to
take the long list of lines given by Gyllenskiold.                  The lines stated
are taken from the table which               I  gave      in   a  note     in January,

    Here, again,   it will be seen, there are many striking coincidences.
 The hydrocarbon fluting at 431 and the hot and cool carbon flutings
 at 468 —474, 483, 517, and 519 are common to both.          The flutings of
 magnesium 500 and 521 and the flutings of lead and manganese
 at 546 and 558 are also common.            The iron fluting at 615 is not
 seen    in comets    at ordinary temperatures, but since it was re
 corded in the Great Comet of 1882, it has been added, in brackets,
 to the list of cometary     flutings. The line at 426, which was seen in
 Comet Wells, has also been added.         It will be noted also that there
 are apparent discrepancies ; some lines appearing only in comets and
 others only in aurorae.      The explanation of the absence of hydrogen
 lines from comets which has already been given applies equally in
 this case.     As there is no repnlsion in the aurora similar to that
 exercised upon comets by the Sun, there is no reason for the absence
 of hydrogen.      In the aurora the hydrogen lines may also be produced
 partly   from  aqueous vapour. The citron carbon flutings 561 and 564
 have not been recorded in the aurora, although they are often seen
 in comets ; their apparent absence from the aurora is probably because
 they fall in the brightest part of the continuous spectrum, and are
 consequently masked.
    The lines special to aurorae are 531, 535, 539, 606, and 630.
       HI.    Comparison   between Comets and      Bright-line Stars.
    In the Bakerian Lecture for 1888 I gave a complete discussion of the
 spectra of bright-line stars, as far as the observations then went, and
 the  conclusion arrived at was that they are nothing more than swarms
 of meteorites a little more condensed than those which we know as
 nebulae.     The main argument in favour of this conclusion was the
 presence of the bright fluting of carbon which extends from 468 to 474.
 This, standing out bright beyond their short continuous spectrum,
 gives rise to an apparent absorption-band in the blue.        The varying
 measurements made by different        observers may possibly have thrown
a little doubt upon the conclusion that the bright band was due to
carbon, but recent observations at Kensington have placed this
beyond doubt.        Direct comparisons of the spectrum of 2nd Cygnus
with the flame of a spirit lamp were made by Mr. Fowler on
September 22nd, and these showed an absolute coincidence of the
bright band in the star with the blue band of carbon seen in the
flame.      The 10-inch equatorial and a spectroscope having one prism
of 60° and two half-prisms were employed.              On October 31st a
similar comparison         was   made   with  3rd  Cygnus, and this also
showed a perfect coincidence.          It was found quite easy to get the
narrow spectrum of the star superposed upon the broader spectrum
 of the flame, so that both could be observed simultaneously.

    [On November 25, the spectrum of 1st Cygnus was observed by
 Mr. Fowler, and again he found a coincidence with the carbon fluting
 at 468 — 474. The observation was confirmed by Mr Baxandall. —
 December      9.]
    Other evidence of carbon flutings was shown by slight rises in
 Vogel's light-curves near 517 and 564. These, however, could not
 be as well seen as the band in the blue, because they fall on the
 bright continuous spectrum from the meteorites.                 In the stars in
 Cygnus,    Mr.   Fowler  detected    brightenings    near  517, and in 2nd and
 3rd Cygnus, perfect coincidences were found with the fluting at
 517 in the spirit-lamp flame.          In this case both 517 and 468—474
 were simultaneously seen to be coincident with flame-bands.
    [In the observation of November 25, carbon 517 was also found in
 1st Cygnus.— December 9.]
   Measurements were made of the brightenings in the spectrum of
7-Cassiopeiae by Mr. Fowler on September 18th, and these were also
found to be coincident with the carbon flutings 517 and 468 —474 ;
the citron fluting at 564 was not seen.            It may be remarked that C,
F, and D3 were seen very bright.
   The conclusions drawn from my suggestions as to the presence of
carbon, as well as hydrogen, in bright-line stars, are therefore
strengthened.
   In the following table, all the lines and flutings recorded in bright-
line stars, with the exception of 7-Cassiopei89, are given.              The lines
recorded by Sherman in 7-Cassiopeise have not yet been confirmed.

     The coincidences         here   are between        the  flutings of hot carbon,
 manganese         558, and   Pb,Na 568. D has only been seen bright in one
 of  the stars (7- Argus), which is probably one of the hottest ; since
 D   was seen bright in two of the hottest comets, I have inserted it in
 the  list of cometary lines and flutings, and [527] and [579] are added
 for the same reason.
    Although nine lines or flutings are common to comets and bright-
 line stars,       six occur in comets which do not appear in bright-
 line stars, and five in bright-line stars which do not appear in
 comets.
    The apparent absence of hydrogen from comets has already been
 referred to, as      well as the absence of Ds. The cool carbon flutings
 are not seen in the bright-line stars because the temperature is too
 high, and Mg 500 is absent for the same reason ; Mg 521 is pro
 bably also absent because of the higher temperature.                        The lead
 Anting at 546 may be masked by continuous spectrum in the bright-
 line stars    ;  at all events,   it appears as an absorption-band when the
 swarms       further     condense.         Besides    the   hydrogen and    D3  lines,
 the   lines     507, 540, and      635 appear       in bright-line stars, bnt not in
 comets.

                                             Group.
     In the Bakerian Lecture           I also gave evidence to show that stars of
 Gronp     II     (Vogel's   Class    Ilia) are of a cometary character, and a
 little more condensed than the bright-line stars.                    The grounds on
 which this conclusion was              arrived   at  was   the   probable presence of
bright carbon flutings, in addition                   to the metallic absorptions.
Observations of «-Herculis and Mira Ceti by Mr. Fowler at Ken
sington and by myself at Westgate-on-Sea have fully confirmed this
view. The rapid increase of brilliancy of the flutings of Mira at its
maximum in 1888 left little doubt in my mind that they were due to
carbon, and          Mr. Fowler's     comparisons showed perfect coincidences
with      the     carbon    flutings, with the dispersion of two prisms
of 60°.
    Some of the origins which               I suggested     for the dark bands have
algo been tested by direct comparisons.                  Duner's bands 4 and 5 were
found to be coincident with the manganese and lead flutings at 558
and 546 respectively, and band 3 was found to be coincident with the
maganese fluting about 586.

36     Mr.  J.  N. Lockyer.       Comparison of    the  Spectra   of  [Dec. 1 9,
follows* : — " The carbon band at 5164 was coincident (within the
limits of observation with this dispersion) with the bright space
towards the blue of Band VI (Duner's band 7), and the sodinm lines
were clearly represented by two dark lines near the middle of Band            II
(Duner's band 3), but the two manganese bands observed, not only
did not coincide with any great band of the spectrum, but were very
far distant from any of them. There were, indeed, faint lines about
the neighbourhood of either manganese band, but the entire spectrum
is full of such lines, and no fluting, nor anything corresponding to one,
could be detected near the place of these two bands. A third manga
nese band was very close to Band         II  (Duner's band 3) of the stellar
spectrum."       On  the  other hand,  Vogel    measured the position of the
sharp edge of a fluting in «-Orionis as 559'1, and Duner's measures
for the same vary from 557.5 to 559.3, none of which can be described
as
     " very far distant " from the manganese fluting near 558. Mr.
Maunder's observation can only be explained by assuming that the
band in question is variable.        This might be produced by variations
in the intensity of the carbon flutings ; the manganese fluting falls
on the carbon fluting near 564, and, according to their relative
intensities, the manganese fluting will be visible or will be marked
by the carbon.       According to Gore, the star was at a minimum in
December,      1887.
   The fluting near 586 corresponds to Duner's band 2, for which
 Duner measures wave-lengths varying from 585'4 to 586.1.                     It
 apparently escaped       Mr. Maunder's    notice,   at  the  time he  made his
observations, that no reference was made in my paper of November,
1887, to any band in the star spectra which fell near the third fluting
of manganese near 535. The first two flutings, near 558 and 586,
fell so near to two of the dark bands in the spectra of the stars of
Group    II that there was strong ground for believing them to be due
to manganese.        This has since been abundantly confirmed by Mr.
 Fowler's direct comparisons of the manganese flutings with the
 spectra of several stars of the group. — December 9.]

lengths measured by Duner for the dark bauds, and the limits of the
 bright spaces which are due to carbon.
    The figures first given refer to the sharp edges of the flutings ;
 the other figures indicate approximately where the flutings fade
 away.
    This comparison      shows    that there is a very close relation between
 comets and Group      II  independent of the probable origins suggested.
 Bright carbon flutings, the manganese fluting at 558, the lead fluting
 at 546, the iron fluting at 615, and the magnesium fluting 521 are
 common.

     As   I showed    in the Bakerian Lecture, Mg 500, when not masked
  by the    broad carbon fluting at 517, is probably indicated by the dark
  band,   for which Duner gives the value 502 to 495,                    so that this may
  also be regarded as common to Group                II     stars and comets.
     The cool carbon flutiugs are seen in comets, but not in stars of
  Group II, the reason being that the temperature is too great.                           The
 hot carbon fluting at 564 is in all probability present in stars of
  Group II, but is always masked, in some cases by continuous
 spectrum, and in others by the absorption fluting of manganese, which
 is nearly coincident with it.
     The line, or probably fluting, at 495 has not yet been recorded in
 comets, but its association with the fluting at 500 in Nova Cygni
 indicates that its apparent absence is entirely due to incomplete
 observations.
    The second fluting of manganese, near 586, though one of the most
prominent       in stars of Group II, has not been observed in cometary
spectra, probably because there is not sufficient continuous spectrum
from the sparse meteoritic background of the comet to produce the
absorption of more than the first fluting of manganese.
    Duner's band 1, 6i7 to 668, has not yet had an origin                         assigned
to  it.
                            V. General Comparisons.
    In the preceding tables        I   have shown that the spectra of nebuhe,
aurorae,    bright-line  stars,  and stars of Group            II  are closely related to
the spectra of comets.          In the table which follows all the spectra are

38           Spectra  of Nebula, Stars,    Comets, and    Aurora:        [Dec. 10,
brought together and compared.             It is not sufficient to show that
each resembles comets in some respects, as each one might have some
feature which was absent in the other.                 I, therefore, give the
following table to show how far they resemble each other. In the
last column the dark bands which are simply due to absence of
radiation, and are not really absorption-bands, are omitted.

    It will    be seen that there are three flutings which run through the
 five columns, namely, 468 — 474, 517, and 558; and four more, H 486,
 Mg500, Mg521, and Pb 546, occur in four out of the five columns.
 Out of the thirty-four lines or flutings given, there are nineteen
 'which occur in less than three columns, but this number is greatly
 reduced when slight differences of temperature, masking effects, and
 the exceptional conditions of comets are taken into account.
     It is now universally agreed that comets are swarms of meteorites,

      1889.]    Bright Carbon Flutingt in Spectra of Celestial Bodies.                 39
     and the    tables   which     I  have   given show that nebulae, bright-line
     stars, stars with mixed flutings, and the aurora have spectra closely
     resembling those of comets, and are therefore probably also meteoritic
     phenomena.
     IL "The Presence of Bright Carbon Flutings in the Spectra
           of Celestial Bodies,"             By J. Nohman Lockyer, F.R.S.
           Keceived November 23, 1889.
        One of the    chief conclusions arrived at in my former papers was
    that not only the nebulee but many of the so-called stars are really
    sparse groups of meteorites, the latter only differing from the former
    by the fact that they are more condensed.                I  also pointed out that if
    this conclusion were correct the spectra                   of both these classes of
    bodies should approximate to those of comets, in which carbon radia
   tion is one of the chief features, while their meteoritic nature is
   generally accepted.          Since those papers were written a further in
   quiry    has  been   made,     both by looking through the records of past
   observations, and by additional observations at Kensington                        and
   Westgate,      with  a  view   of  gaining more information as to        the presence
   or absence of bright carbon flutings in the spectra of nebulae and
   •tars.
       Certain    results have already been obtained which                I think suffici
  ently interesting to communicate                to the Society. Before these ob
  servations were made,           I  suggested that some of Vogel's observations
  might be interpreted to signify bright carbon, but there was then a
  little donbt as to the existence of the bright flutings in the stellar
  spectra, as their presence was only suggested in some cases by slight
 rises in the light curves.
      The following is a list of the bodies which contain either one or
 both of the carbon flutings near 517 and 468 — 474, the latter being
 a group of flutings, which, as            I  have before shown,* sometimes has
 its point of maximum brightness shifted from 474 to 468.                            The
Anting near 564 has been omitted from the table, as it is generally
 masked, either by continuous spectrum or by the superposition of
the fluting of manganese near 558.                   The wave-lengths given are as
measured by the various observers stated.
     The spectrum of the aurora is added for the sake of completeness.
     It will be seen from the table that the record of the presence of
carbon is unbroken from a planetary nebula through stars with
bright lines; to those resembling a Herculis, i.e., entirely through
Groups       I  and  II   of my classification.

    It has long been known, from the classic researches of Dr. Joule,
 that a rod of iron free from stress increases in length when magne
 tised in a comparatively weak field.     When, however, the strength of
 the field is continually raised, it has been found by Mr. Shelford
 Bidwell that the rod ceases to increase in length, and then shortens,
 so that in a sufficiently strong field the length becomes less than it
 was originally.    It has also been found by Villari, Sir W. Thomson,
 and others that when a rod of iron is exposed to successive loadings
 and unloadings of a given weight in a magnetic field, there appears a
 corresponding cyclic change of magnetisation. In this cyclic change
 the maximum magnetisation occurs when the load is "on," or when
 the load is " off," according as the field is weaker or stronger than a
certain critical field depending on the load, called by Sir W. Thomson
the Villari critical field.
    Cobalt has been found by Mr. Shelford Bidwell to shorten when
magnetised in weak fields, but to lengthen in very strong fields.    The
field in which it ceases to shorten is very much higher than the field
in which iron ceases to lengthen. Also in weak fields Sir W. Thomson
has found the magnetisation of a cobalt rod under cyclic applications
of tension to be least when the tension is " on."

42                   Mr. C. Chree.    On the Effects of        [Dec. 19,
   Now Professor     J. J. Thomson has shown that on dynamical prin
ciples the effect of changes  of magnetisation on the length of a rod of
magnetic metal, and the effect of changes in the length of the rod
on the magnetisation, must be fundamentally connected.            In his
" Applications    of Dynamics to Physics and Chemistry," he has
arrived at mathematical equations connecting the two phenomena,
such that from a knowledge of the one set of phenomena the cha
racter of the other set can be deduced.
   The conclusions derived from the theory are in the case of iron in
accordance with the results of experiment, at least in their general
character. In cobalt there is also an agreement between theory and
experiment, so far as Sir W. Thomson's experiments go. In the
absence of farther experiments it would, however, be impossible to
tell whether or not this agreement extended to the strong fields in
which occurred the important phenomena observed by Mr. Shelford
Bidwell.    The application of Professor J. J. Thomson's formulae to
Mr. Shelford Bidwell's results led him to the conclusion that under
cyclic applications of pressure a cobalt rod should experience cyclic
change of magnetisation, and that the maximum magnetisation should
answer to pressure "on," or to pressure "off," according as the
magnetic field was weaker or stronger than a critical field, corre
sponding to the Villari field in iron. It was for the purpose of deter
mining whether such a critical field did actually exist that the present
investigation was commenced at Professor J. J. Thomson's sugges
tion.
   Employing the magnetometric method, it was found that the agree
ment between theory and experiment was at .least as satisfactory in
cobalt as in iron. The application of pressure cycles in a magnetic
field led to a cyclic change of magnetisation in a cobalt rod, in which
the maximum magnetisation occurred when pressure was " on," or
when it was " off," according as the strength of the field was below
or above 120 C.G.S. units. This accordingly was the Villari critical
field foreshadowed by theory.
   Various phenomena which promised to throw light on the true
character of the relations of strain and magnetisation having been
noticed at an early period of the investigation, it was decided to make
an attempt to isolate the phenomena, and examine them exhaustively.
   In weak fields the first pressure applied after the introduction of
the cobalt rod into the magnetising coil caused a large increase in the
induced magnetisation. As the strength of the field was raised this
change in the magnetisation attained a maximum, then diminishing
vanished in a field considerably stronger than the Villari field for the
cyclic effect, and in all stronger fields consisted in a diminution of
magnetisation. The fields in which the cyclic effect of pressure and
the effect of the first pressure were absolutely greatest occurred in the

   1889.]        Pressure on the Magnetisation     of Cobalt.           43
  neighbourhood of the " wende-punkt," or point where the coefficient
  of magnetic induction is a maximum. Relatively, however, to the
  intensity of the pre-existing induced magnetisation both the effects
  continually diminished in importance, as the strength of the field was
 raised from zero. In tho weakest experimental field the first pressure
 increased the induced magnetisation by over 50 per cent., and fully
  4 per cent. of the magnetisation took part in the cyclic change accom
 panying the pressure cycles.       In some respects these results present
 a close resemblance to those observed by Professor Ewing in iron.
     It was found that the existence of pressure previous to and during
 the introduction of the rod into a coil traversed by a current had an
 effect of the same general character, though not exactly of the same
 magnitude, as the first application of pressure when the rod on its
 introduction into the coil was free from pressure.      Also on the break
 of a current during which pressure cycles had been applied, the rod
 manifested a polar character, in that, when exposed a second time
 without intermediate demagnetisation to the same strength of current,
 it possessed a greater intensity of magnetisation when the current
passed in one direction than when it passed in the other. Both these
effects had critical fields where they vanished and changed sign, and
these fields were close to, if not identical with, the field in which the
effect of the first pressure vanished. In fields below the critical the
magnetisation of the rod when exposed a second time, without inter
mediate demagnetisation, to a current of the same strength as one in
which pressure cycles had just been applied was greatest when the
direction of the current was unchanged ; but in fields above the
critical the reverse was the case.
    Both Villari and Professor Ewing observed that after the break of
the magnetising current cyclic changes of tension produced eventually
in iron wires cyclic changes of the residual magnetisation. In these
the maximum magnetisation answered, as in the induced magnetisa
tion in fields below the Villari point, to tension " on." Professor Ewing
apparently examined the effect only in weak fields, but he does not
seem to have anticipated that it would change its character in stronger
fields.
    In the present investigation   the existence of a cyclic change in the
residual magnetisation      of cobalt accompanying cyclic changes of
pressure    has  been  established,   and tho magnitude of the effect
examined in a large number of fields, extending from 0 to 400 C.G.S.
units.    It was found that not only the magnitude but the sign even
of the effect depended largely on the condition of the rod during
the break of the ourrent. When the rod was under pressure during
the break, the residual magnetisation in the cyclic state showed a
maximum under pressure, whatever was the strength of the pre
existing field. When, however, the rod was free from pressure during

44     Effects of Pressure  on the Magnetisation  of Cobalt.   [Dec. 19,
the break of the current,     it was only in the residual magnetisation
left after the weakest fields that the maximum answered to pressure
" on." When the strength of the pre-existing field was raised, the
effect passed through the value zero and changed sign. In the
absence of all pressure during the flow of the current this critical
field was only about 18 C.G.S. units. The application of pressure
cycles during the flow of the current raised the critical field to about
30 C.G.S. units, but in fields over 60 C.G.S. units seemed to have
extremely little effect. The intensity of the residual magnetisation
when the cyclic effect of pressure vanished was of course in either
case only a small fraction of the intensity of the induced magnetisa
tion in the Villari critical field.
    In the absence of all pressure the residual magnetisation left after
the break of weak fields was very small, but in the weakest experi
mental fields its amount was increased in the ratio of 4 or 5 to 1 by
the application of pressure cycles during the flow of the current.    In
fields over 30 C.G.S. units this effect of pressure cycles became
extremely small.
   The application of the first pressure subsequent to the break of
the magnetising current and the removal of a pressure existing
during the break of the current were found to shake out a consider
able amount of the residual magnetisation.       The percentage shaken
out by the application of the pressure was decidedly the higher in
strong fields, but in weak fields the reverse was the case when pressure
cycles had been applied during the flow of the current.
   Various other kindred phenomena were observed, and the laws of
their variation examined.      Most of the results obtained are given in
tables, and curves are drawn showing the dependence of the more
important effects on the strength of the field.
    All the observations were made on a single specimen of cobalt, and
by repeating certain of the observations at intervals it was proved
that the condition of the specimen must have remained essentially
unaltered while the different phenomena were being examined.        Thus
the several effects can be directly compared, and their mutual relation
ships are not masked by those differences of condition which are sure
to exist between different specimens.       An attempt has thus been
made from an analysis of the phenomena to attain some knowledge
of the true character of the magnetic changes effected by the applica
tion of pressure.
   The experiments were all conducted in the Cavendish Laboratory,
and the author is much indebted to Professor Thomson for the facilities
afforded him, and for suggestions as to the form of the apparatus and
the methods employed.

   The theory of the method of condensation has been previously
given by the author    in the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society,' vol. 41,
p. .352.
   Since the publication of that paper a much more extended know
ledge of the capabilities of the method has been acquired, which has led
to the construction of new forms of the apparatus, simple in construc
tion and easily applied. Two of these are described and illustrated,
one of which is new in principle, being a differential form of the
calorimeter.    The accuracy of observation attained by this latter form
is so considerable that it has been found possible to estimate directly
the specific heats of the gases at constant volume to a close degree of
accuracy.
   An error incidental to the use of the method arising from the
radiation of the substance, when surrounded by steam, to the walls of
the calorimeter, is inquired into.      It is shown that this affects the
accuracy of the result to a very small degree, and is capable of easy
estimation and elimination.
   Further confirmation of the truth of the method is afforded in a
comparison of experiments made in different forms of the steam
calorimeter.
   Various tables of constants are given to facilitate the use of the
method, and the results of experiments on the density of saturated
steam at atmospheric pressures, made directly in the calorimeter, are
included.     These are concordant with the deductions of Zeuner,
based on Regnault's observations on the properties of steam, and
were undertaken in the hope of affording reliable data on which to
calculate the displacement effect on the apparent weight of the sub
stance transferred from air to steam.

mode of application of the steam calorimeter.

that the three stresses R, S, T, may be treated as zero, where R is the

normal traction perpendicular to the middle surface, and S and T are
the two shearing stresses which tend to produce rotation about two
lines of curvature of the middle surface.                   This hypothesis requires
that these stresses  should     be  at  least    of   the order of the square of the
thickness of the shell, for when this is the case they give rise to terms
in the expression for the potential energy due to strain, which are
proportional to the fifth power of the thickness, and which may be
neglected, since it is usually unnecessary to retain powers of the
thickness higher than the cube. It can be proved directly from the
general equations of motion of an elastic solid, that this proposition is
true in the case of a plane plate, provided the surfaces of the plate
are not subjected to any pressures or tangential stresses, but there
does' not appear to be any simple method of establishing a similar
proposition in the case of curved shells.                  I have therefore adopted
this proposition  as  a fundamental           hypothesis, and have endeavoured
to establish its truth and to obtain a satisfactory theory of cylindrical
and spherical shells in the following manner :

(1) a tension, Tj ; (2) a tangential shearing stress, M2 ; (3) a normal

                               depend partly upon quantities which define
 the bending, and partly upon the extension of the middle surface.
   This expression      different from that obtained by Mr. Love, which
                               is
arises from the fact that he has omitted to take into account several
terms depending upon the product of the extensions and hs. It will
be noticed that (iv) reduces to the second line when the middle surface
is inextensible, and in this case agrees with the expression obtained
by    Lord Rayleigh.*

   The variational equation of motion may be written
                          m + B&    = SU+Sjt                            (v)
where    cS is the term depending on the time variations of the dis
placements, £U is the work done by the bodily forces, and S'g is the
work done upon the edges of the portion of the shell considered, by
the stresses arising from the action of contiguous portions of the
shell.
   Applying (v) to a curvilinear rectangle bounded by four lines
of curvature, and working out the variation in the usual way, the
line integral part will determine the values of the edge stresses
Ts, Ts . . ., in terms of the displacements, and ought also to reproduce
the values of the couples which we have already obtained; and the
surface integral part will give the three equations of motion in terms
of the displacements. These results furnish a test of the correctness
of the work, and also of the fundamental hypothesis upon which the
 theory is based ; for if we substitute the values of the edge stresses in
terms of the displacements       in the first three of (i), we ought to
reproduce the equations of motion which we have obtained by means
of the variational equation ; and this is found to be the case.
    The boundary conditions can be obtained by Stokes' theorem, which
 enables us to prove that it is possible to apply a certain distribution
 of stress to the edge of a thin shell, without producing any alteration
 in the potential energy due to strain.
    The general equations, owing to their exceedingly complicated
character, do not, except in special cases, readily lend themselves to
the solution of mathematical problems ; bnt, for the purpose of throw
ing some light upon the question raised by Mr. Love, as to the
 impossibility of satisfying the boundary conditions at a free edge,
 when a curved shell is vibrating in such a manner that its middle
surface experiences no extension nor contraction throughout the
 motion,  I  have considered the following statical problem : —
    A heavy cylindrical shell, whose cross section is a semi-circle, is sus-
pended by vertical bands attached to its straight edges, so that its axis is
 horizontal, and is deformed by its own weight ; required the strain pro
 duced.
    We shall assume that the displacement at every point of the middle
 surface lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis, and we shall suppose
 that the necessary stresses are applied to the circular edges.
    Measuring 0 from the lowest point and putting R for the change of
 curvature along a circular section, we find that
            R—E                3a(^7r—   0sin0— cos0)
                                                                   ""*      ''

 change    of curvature is large in comparison with the extension, except
 at poiuts in the neighbourhood of the edge, where a (^ *—<i') is com
 parable with h.
    It is also shown that the tension          Tj parallel to the axis, and the
 couple G2    about  a  circular section   do  not vanish at the circular edges,
 but have finite values ; and therefore a tension and a couple of the
 proper amount, which tends to produce synclastic curvature of the
 generating lines must be applied at the circular edges.             If, therefore,
 this force and couple were removed, anticlastic curvature of the
 generating lines would be produced, and this would involve extension
 of the middle surface parallel to the axis.             It is, however, obvious
 that a thin shell, under these circumstances, does not assume a saddle
 back form, and therefore the anticlastic curvature, and the extension
 upon which it depends, must be exceedingly small, except in the
 neighbourhood of the circular edges.
    The difficulty of satisfying the boundary conditions at a curved free
 edge, when the middle surface is supposed to be inextensible,               partly
 arises from the fact that it is impossible for the flexural couple about
 the curved edge to vanish, unless some extension or contraction takes
 place in the neighbourhood of the edge ; but the inference to be
 drawn from the statical problem considered above is, that when a thin
 shell, whose edges are free, is vibrating, the amplitudes of those terms
 upon which the extension depends are small in comparison with the
 amplitudes of those terms upon which the bending depends.                   More
 over, a variety of results which have been obtained during recent
 years indicate, that the pitch of notes which depend upon extension is
 very high, compared with tho pitch of notes which depend upon
 flexure ; and this circumstance, combined with the smalluess of the
amplitudes of the extensional vibrations, points to the conclusion that
the former notes are usually feeble in comparison with the latter.
    The values of the edge stresses and the equations of motion are
also obtained for a spherical shell, but the work is the same as in the
case of a cylindrical shell, except in matters of detail.

     In   1863    Julius Thomsen communicated to the " Naturforscher-
                    " at Stockholm an account of some determinations he had
  versammlung
  made    of " The Mechanical       Equivalent of Light," and an abstract of
                              in '                           '
  this   paper    appeared         Poggendorff 's Annalen       (vol. 125, 1865,
  p. 348).
     He allowed the radiation from a sperm candle, a moderator lamp,
 and a gas flame, to fall on the face of a thermopile, and noted the de
  flection   of the needle of a galvanometer in the thermoelectric circuit,
 when the radiation fell directly on the pile, and when it did so after
  passing through 20 cm. of water contained in a glass cell.              In order
 to reduce the readings to absolute measure, he placed a glass globe
 containing hot water in front of the thermopile, and observed the
 deflection of the galvanometer; the mass of water contained                in the
 globe,    the  water-equivalent    of the  globe, the temperature   of the water,
 and of the room, being all known, from the observed rate of cooling
 the radiation, calculated by Dulong's formula, was determined.
     By assuming that the 20 cm. of water absorbed all, or nearly all,
 the heat      rays (i.e., the non-visible), and transmitted nearly all the
 light rays, the loss of light being found experimentally to be only 13
 per cent., he was able to calculate the proportion of light and heat
 (i.e., visible and non-visible) radiations emitted by the flames, and to
 determine the mechanical equivalent of the light.             He found that the
 ratio of the luminous to the total radiation was about the same for
the candle, the oil lamp, and the gas flame, the amount being nearly
 2 per cent.
     He states " a flame whose light intensity is equal to one light unit,
that is, one due to the combustion of 8'2 grams of spermaceti per hour,
radiates as light per minute an amount of heat which would raise the
temperature of 4'1 grams of water one degree."                  On this last sen
tence it must be remarked that a light unit cannot be expressed by a
statement of the mass of a combustible consumed, but perhaps the
original paper contains qualifications omitted in the Abstract.
     Melloni (' Comptes Rendas,' vol. 31, 1850, p. 476) states " Le rayon-

    Tyndall (' Phil. Mag.,* 1864, vol. 28, p. 335 ; and Contributions to
Molecular Physics,' p. 260) states that he placed in front of his thermo
pile a rock-salt cell and observed the deflection of the galvanometer
when the radiation from (1) an incandescent platinum wire, (2) the
brightest part of a gas flame, (3) an electric arc lamp, passed through
the cell, filled first with pure bisulphide of carbon, and then with
bisulphide of carbon in which iodine had been dissolved ; he found
that the percentages of luminous to total radiation from the three
sources were —
               Incandescent platinum                        4'17

               Arc lamp                                    l0'0
From measurements made by Mr. Merritt and Mr. Nakano (" Efficiency
of Methods of Artificial Illumination," by Professor E. Nichols ; ' The
 Electrical Engineer,' May, 1889), the efficiency (i.e., the ratio of
luminous radiation to total radiation) of arc and incandescent electric
 lamps appears to be about 10 and 5 per cent, respectively.
    The experiments of which an account is contained in this           paptr
 were commenced with the object of repeating and extending Thomson's
 observations ; soon after they had been begun a notice appeared in
            '
 '
   Nature (July 4, 1889) of a communication made on June 7, 1889,
 to the Physical Society of Berlin, by Dr. R. von Heluiholtz, on the
 radiation from flames, and under these circumstances it seemed
 desirable to finish the experiments which had been already com
 menced, but not to go on with the enquiry until Dr. von Helmholtz's
 paper should have been published in full.
    The experiments were made by allowing the radiation from an
 Argand gas flame to fall on the face of a thermopile, either directly
 or after passing through different thicknesses of water, or of a solution
 of alum in water, contained in cells with glass ends.
     Instead of keeping the source of heat at a fixed distance from the
  thermopile, and noting the deflections of the galvanometer, which
  was the method employed by Melloni and those who have followed
 him, the distance between the source and the face of the pile was
 made the variable, and the distances noted at which equal deflections
  were produced ; thus the necessity for calibrating the galvanometer wan
 avoided, and also for assuming that the (corrected) deflections of the
 needle were strictly proportional to the amount of radiant energy
  incident upon the face of the pile.
     On the other hand, it was necessary to assume that the amount of
 energy which reached the thermopile varied inversely as the square

             Non-luminous Radiation emitted by a Gas Flame.               57
  of the  distance from the source, and as the flame and chimney were of
  considerable size, the position of the source was not well defined ; it
  was also   necessary to assume that the amonnt of absorption due to the
  air, or to the aqueous vapour it contained, was negligible, or at least
  that  it could be allowed for.
     An ordinary thermopile with fifty-four couples and a low resistance
  Nobili's galvanometer were used.         The galvanometer needles, which
  were rendered as nearly astatic as possible, were suspended in the
  ordinary way by a silk fibre, a plane mirror was attached to them, and
  the image of a slit placed in the slide-holder of a magic lantern
  thrown by reflection from the mirror on to a scale placed about
  0'8 metre from the galvanometer.          The scale was divided into half
  centimetres, and the position of the line of light was read to 1 mm. by
  estimation.     A deflection of 4° on the circle of the galvanometer cor
  responded to about five divisions on the scale.
     In order that the galvanometer should have a fairly fixed zero, it
  was found     necessary to place a weak magnet, a slightly magnetised
  knitting needle, at a short distance from it ; this reduced the sensibility
  of the instrument, but it was still much more sensitive to the feeble
  thermoelectric currents than a low resistance (0'5 ohin) Thomson gal
  vanometer of the ordinary pattern.
     The galvanometer coil was nearly perpendicular to the magnetic
  meridian, and the adjusting magnet        so placed  that the needles were
  parallel to the axis of the coil.
     The thermopile was fixed at the end of a horizontal stand, to which
 a divided scale was attached, and was connected by covered copper
 wires with      the galvanometer,     a three-way plug   being  inserted   in
 the circuit.
    Both faces of the thermopile, which had been carefully blackened
 with camphor       smoke, were exposed ; the radiation from the lamp
 whose light-giving power was to be measured fell on the one, and the
 radiation from a compensating source of heat, an Argand with a metal
 chimney, on the other.       Tin-plate screens were placed on either side of
 the pile, and the space between them stuffed with cotton wool, to
 screen it from air currents and from the radiation of surrounding
 objects, it being impossible to use the reflecting cones with the method
of measurement employed.
    Four cells of wood well soaked in paraffin were used to hold the
water and alum solution; their ends were closed with pieces of crown
glass, cut from the same plate of Messrs. Chance's manufacture,
which were pressed against the ends of the cells by wooden pressure-
plates and screws, a washer of vulcanised sheet-india-rubber being
interposed between the cell and the glass.         This arrangement enabled
the same pair of plates to be used with all four cells.           The plates
were 1*5 mm. thick,         the  cells were 15 cm. deep, 10 cm. wide, and

58      Sir John Conroy.       On  the   Amount    of Luminous and
1 cm., 5 cm., 10 cm., and 15 cm., long ; each of the washers was about
1  mm. thick, so that the radiations which passed through the cells
had to traverse 3 mm. of glass and 1/2 cm., 5-2 cm., 10'2 cm., or
15-2 cm. of water in Cells  I, II,  III,  and  IV.
   The determinations were made by placing one of the cells in front
of the thermopile, and about 9 cm. from it, a screen with a rect
angular aperture, 5 cm. by 3 cm., being fixed at about 2 cm. from the
end of the cell nearest the pile, in order to prevent any radiations
reflected from the surfaces of the water in the cell reaching the pile ;
the glass plates were always well cleaned immediately before being
used, and the cell filled with freshly filtered distilled water.
   An Argand burner, 1"5 cm. in diameter, with a glass chimney 4'5 cm.
in diameter and 15 cm. high, was placed beyond the cell, a tin-plate
screen being interposed.
   In the experiments recorded in this paper the axis of the burner
was 3T8 cm. from the face of the pile.
   The index of the galvanometer was then, if necessary, brought to
zero and the circuit closed ; closing the circuit almost always caused
the line of light to move in one or other direction. By adjusting the
height of the flame of the compensating burner, which was invariably
small, from 0'3 cm. to 0'8 cm., and its distance from the thermopile,
the line of light was brought back to the zero, or nearly so.
   A horizontal wire was clamped to the stand of the burner whose
radiation was to be observed, 10 cm. above the plate of the burner,
and by means of a tap the height of the flame so regulated that its
tip just appeared above the wire.
   The metal screen was then removed, the amplitude of the first
swing of the galvanometer needle observed, and the screen replaced.
   The oscillations of the needle were extremely slow, and, therefore,
instead of always waiting till it had completely come to rest again, as
soon as the oscillations had become small, about half a division of the
scale or less, the screen was again removed and another reading1
made, care being taken to always remove the screen whilst the index
was passing the point taken as zero, and in the opposite direction to
that in which the deflection due to the heat would occur.
   In this way twelve readings were made, and then the cell was
removed and the lamp placed at a greater distance from the pile,
which was shielded by a tin-plate screen which could be moved to and
fro by strings.
    It was usually necessary to readjust the compensating lamp, and
 when the index had again been brought to zero the screen was
removed and the deflection noted.          After a few trials a position was
found   for the lamp  in which  the  deflection was about the same as that
produced by the radiation which had passed through the water; a
reading of the deflection was made with the lamp in this position, and

              Non-luminous       Radiation emitted hy a Gas Flame.              59
 then   it was moved       10 cm.  along the scale, and another readiug made ;
 the distances were thus ascertained at which the whole radiation
 from the lamp produced a somewhat less and a somewhat greater
 effect upon the galvanometer than had been produced by that portion
 of the radiation which had passed through the glass and water of the
 cell, with the lamp close to the pile.
    The measurements were repeated six times for each position of the
 lamp ; a curve was then plotted with the distances at which the lamp
 had been placed when no cell had been interposed between it and the
 pile as abscissae, and the mean deflections corresponding to each of
these positions as ordinates, and then the abscissa of a point whose
ordinate was equal to the mean deflection when the cell had been
interposed ascertained.            This indirect method was adopted, as it
would have been impossible, without making a very large number of
measurements, to have ascertained the exact position of the lamp for
which the direct radiation produced the same effect as that portion of
it which had passed through the water.

and Table       II  the mean of three sets of readings made with the four
cells, and with the lamp at different distances from the thermopile,

be added to the scale readings of the position of the lamp.         The
distance of the axis of the lamp from the face of the thermopile, when
the cell was interposed, was 31'8 cm. ; the glass and water of the cell
being more refractive than air, interposing the cell virtually reduced
the distance between the pile and the lamp.           The rays which
traversed the cell differing in refrangibility, and being incident upon

the optical shortening of the distance.

    It  is usually stated that water saturated with alum is more adia-
 thermanous than pure water.
    Melloni found (' Annales de Chimie,' vol. 153, 1833, p. 1) that
 12 per cent. of the total radiation of an oil lamp with double air
 current passed through 921 mm. of a solution of alum contained in a
 glass cell, whilst 11 per cent, passed through the same thickness of
 water, or that the diathermancy of these two liquids in glass cells was
 practically the same.
    It seems very unlikely that no other observations should have
 been made on this point, but a careful search              has failed to disclose
 the record of any.
    A solution of ammonia alum, saturated at about 15°, was prepared,
 and some preliminary observations were made with it in the manner
 already described ; the coefficient of transmission for Cell I appeared
 to be slightly less, and that for Cell       II slightly greater than when the
 cells were filled with water, but the differences were so small that it
 was thought that it would be more satisfactory to fill Cell I alter
 nately with the alum solution and with pure water, and note the
 deflections of the galvanometor. Table IV gives a number of these
 readings : twelve were first made with the alum solution, and then

    The amount of light transmitted by the four cells was determined,
the photometric arrangement used being the one described in the
  Philosophical Transactions,' A, vol. 180, 1889, p. 248. It consisted
'
essentially of a small Argand gas burner and of two mirrors, so placed
that they reflected the light of the lamp towards each other.                         The
photometer was placed between them, and the cell between the
photometer and one of the mirrors, and six readings made of the
position in which there was equality of illumination; the cell was
then placed on the other side of the photometer, and six more read
ings made of the new position of equality of illumination ; from these
measurements the value of k, the coefficient of transparency, was
calculated by the expression       (he. cit., p. 250)   k = -^

shown that the value of a per millimetre, for the crown and flint
glass experimented with, was 099735 and 0'99884 ; the transparency
of water appears to exceed considerably that of either kind of glass,
being 0'9998 per millimetre.
   From the mean value of a. the values of p, on the assumption that
p = p', were obtained by calculating the value of «' for the different
thicknesses of water, and then introducing this value into the
equation i = Ipp'at, where i is the measured amount of the per
centage transmitted by each of the cells.

   The agreement between the values of p, as deduced from the
measurements made with each of the four cells, confirms the general
accuracy of the photometric observations.
    Glass and water transmit,- as is well known, radiations differing in
wave-length with very different degrees of facility ; all the kinds of
radiations which affect the eye as light suffer about the same amount
of absorption (i.e., these media are colourless) ; but, as Melloni
showed many years ago, the case is very different when the total
radiation from any source of light and heat is considered.
   Table VIII gives the percentage amounts of total and visible radia
tion transmitted by the four cells, and also the transmission co
efficients A and * for the total and visible radiations, as deduced from
the measurements made with each pair of cells.

   The table shows that the percentage amount of visible radiation
absorbed by the water increases regularly with the thickness, but that
in the case of the total radiation each additional centimetre of water
absorbs less than those that have preceded it, and that the trans
mission coefficients for the total radiation increase as the thickness
increases, whilst those for the visible radiation remain nearly constant.
From the values of these coefficients it appears that a thickness of
3 mm. of glass and 102 mm. of water is not sufficient to arrest all
the non-luminous radiations emitted by an Argand gas burner.                        The
transmission coefficients for the total and visible radiations as deduced
from the measurements made with Cells                   III  and IV are much closer
together     than   those     deduced      from    the    measurements      made with
Cells I and II, and         II   and    III,    and this seems to show that the
amonnt of non-luminous radiation which passed through Cell IV was
very small, and that, therefore, the 1-646 per cent, transmitted con
sisted almost exclusively of visible radiation, i.e., light.
    The photometric measurements show that 84¦68 per cent, of the

                Non-luminous         Radiation emitted by a Gas Flame.           65
     incident  light traversed Cell       IV ; hence it would appear, if we assume
     that neither      the air nor the aqueous vapour absorbed a measurable
     amount of the radiation, that the total radiation of the gas burner
     contained    1¦646     x         or P94 per cent, of luminous radiation, a
                               o4'oo
     result that agrees       with that obtained by Julius Thomsen.
         As has already been stated, the method employed was based on the
    assumption       that the amount of absorption due to the air or to the
    aqueous vapour it contained was negligible, or at least that it could
    be   allowed for.       The experiments were made in an underground room
    in which the temperature            and the hygrometric condition of the air
    varied but slightly.          The readings of a wet and dry bulb thermometer
    never differed during the course of the experiments more than about
    1" F., the temperature         of the air varying from about 59° F. to 67° F.
    Hence it was always nearly saturated, and the mass of water-vapour
    per unit volume of air was nearly the same.
       Professor Tyndall states (' Contributions to Molecular Physics,'
    p. 133) that 4 feet of saturated          air (the temperature of the air and
   the nature of the source of radiation, which from the diagram was
   apparently a gas flame, are not mentioned) absorbed 5| per cent, of
   the total radiation.
       If we assume that for very small angles (and in the course of these
   experiments the angles never exceeded 4J) the deflections of the gal
   vanometer were strictly proportional to the amount of radiant energy
   incident upon the face of the thermopile, and that the radiation from
   the lamp       suffered no absorption before it reached the thermopile,
   then the deflections of the galvanometer would vary inversely with
  the square       of the distance of the lamp. Table       II shows that the mean
  deflection when the lamp was 150 cm. from the thermopile was 414
  scale divisions.          The deflections corresponding to other positions of
  the lamp were          calculated   by the expression       L=      =   d, where
 x is    the distance of the lamp, and d the scale reading; the results are
 set    forth in Table IX, column 2.
      If, however, a portion of the radiation from the lamp was absorbed
 by    the air, or the aqueous vapour it contained, then the decrease in
 the deflection as the lamp was moved             further and further off would be
partially due to the increased amount of absorption produced by the
longer column of            air and aqueous vapour.
     Taking Professor TyndalPs value for the absorption (5'5 per cent,
in 4 feet), the percentage amount that would be absorbed in passing
through 10 cm., 50 cm., 60 cm., 70 cm., and 80 cm. of saturated air
was      calculated, and thence, by the expression given above, the value
for the deflection        ;  *s being taken as (distance  oflamp^x 100

closely with the observed values contained in column 4 than those
calculated on the assumption that there was no absorption. The
deflections of the galvanometer, however, were so small, and therefore
the difference between the two sets of calculated values for the deflec
tions, and the observed values, so slight, that no very definite con
clusions can be drawn from them ; they seem, however, to show that
some absorption did take place, and to about the same amount as

    In the  experiments made with Cell IV, the radiation from the lamp
had to traverse about 15 cm. of air when the cell was interposed
between the lamp and the pile, and about 215 cm. when the cell was
 removed.     The absorption in the former case must, according             to
 Professor Tyndall's experiments, have been insensible, and in the
 latter case have amounted to about 97 per cent. ; assuming that the
 absorption is proportional to the length of air traversed, an assumption
 which in all probability is not strictly true.

    Thus, allowing for the absorption due to the aqueous vapour, and to
 the loss which the light suffered in passing through the cell, it appears
 that the total radiation from the lamp consisted of 175 per cent.

 smaller value for the percentage of luminous radiation than tlxat
 found by Julius Thomsen.

              Path of Discharge over   the  Surface of a Dielectric.
    The subject of dust-figures produced           by electrical discharge has
received much attention at various times.             In the following notes I
have refrained, to the best of my knowledge, from going over old
ground. The subject has been reviewed in Lehmann's recently
               '
published Molekularphysik.'           It is a sufficient substitute for the
customary resume of past observations to refer to that work.
    (1.) When a spark discharge occurs in a homogeneous dielectric
medium, the path of discharge, as is known, in general lies in a fairly
straight line between the points of discharge. If the dielectric
medium be heterogeneous in character, the path chosen by the spark
will vary with the circumstances. Thus, if the straight line between
the conductors be interrupted by a layer of a substance offering a
      aer resistance to discharge than the surrounding dielectri ', the
   ¦/fOfc XLVII.                                                       G

«»                             Mr.  J. Joly.
discharge may bo chiefly confined to this surrounding dielectric,,
spreading over the surface of the layer in ramifying lines.
   This ramifying discharge is depicted in some measure in Lichten-
berg's figures and in Antolik's. But these lose some of their value in
the fact that they represent an electrified condition of the surface of
a dielectric obtaining subsequent to the period of discharge.       The
path of discharge revealed in the figm-es described in this paper is, on
the other hand, laid down by the outspreading current in the act of
discharge. There is some resemblance between all three patterns of
figures, more especially with Antolik's, whose figures are obtained
with a similar disposition of apparatus.
   The following are the arrangements used in obtaining the dust-
figures: —
   A  plate of glass is coated evenly with a thin layer of lycopodium
powder.     This is best done by placing the glass on the bottom of a
deep box and shaking the powder from a linen bag, surrounded with
a couple of folds of gauze, through a hole in the lid of the box.   The
plate is next transferred to the surface of a smooth sheet of metal.
Wires from the + and — poles of a Ruhmkorff coil are then brought
down just to meet the surface of the glass, touching it at points 6 or
8 cm. removed from each other and symmetrical about the centre of
the plate.   It is immaterial if the underlying conductor be connected
to earth or not. By drawing back the hammer of the coil and again
bringing it sharply forward, a single make and break is effected.     At
                  "
the moment of make," hardly any disturbance of the dust, save for
a couple of millimetres around the poles, is noticeable, but at the
             "
moment of break
                     " the dust is
                                     suddenly agitated and thrown into
the pattern shown in Plate 1, a flash of burning lycopodium some
times accompanying.
   This figure depicts the case where the poles have been brought into
such proximity as to permit, in addition to the ramifying discharge,
the direct passage of a spark.      If the poles on the glass be so far
removed that no spark passes from pole to pole, the figures appear
each separate and complete, but in general branching towards one
another.    If one pole of the coil be put in connexion with the metal
plate beneath the glass and the other be applied centrally to the glass,
a figure corresponding to the nature of the pole so applied to the
glass is produced.     These figures tend to become more symmetrical
in development and rounded in outline according as care is taken to
centre the pole on the plate and the conductor beneath the plate, and
also when the plate used is large. Omitting the underlying conductor
diminishes the extent of the figures.
   (2.) Of these figures, the + pattern is moss-like and irregular on
the edge, the — pattern smooth and cloudy in outline.         It is seen
that within each of the figures the pattern corresponding to the

                     Observations    on the Spark Discharge.               69
  opposite   sign is located.       Thus, near the centre of the positive
  pattern the cloudy-edged negative pattern is found, and vice versa.
  More than one internal figure may sometimes, but rarely, be observed.
  Thus a    third figure, corresponding to the external pattern, may
  occur.     Whether these secondary figures are due to a certain
  amount of oscillation in the current flowing through the circuit
  ur not is not well determined.          An experiment in which both the
  capacity and self indnction of this circuit was increased by inserting
  in it the secondary circuit of a second coil of nearly equal dimensions
  afforded figures no way differing from those previously produced.         It
  is observable, too, that very large and very small coils give a similar
  arrangement of the figures.         There are other reasons for believing
  that the major part of the current in a coil discharge is unidirectional,
  bnt a small amount of return current might cause the central disturb
  ance on the plate.     Again, the central figure may be due to a back
  discharge    from   the   electrified surface of the plate, as Professor
  Fitzgerald suggests.
     If the inner coats   of two Leyden jars be connected with the poles of
  the coil and     so arranged that they can spark to each other across a
  gap of 4 or 5 cm.,   the outer coats being separately connected with the
  wires touching the powdered surface of the plate, the phenomena of
  discharge    differ somewhat.       This circuit will afford an oscillatory
  discharge, and accordingly it is found that triple figures are most
  frequently formed and that the secondary figure is more conspicuously
  developed.     When the poles on the plate are very near each other, so
  that a very vigorous spark passes, the secondary figures are seen to
  encroach on the primary, even branching through them and mixing
  with them, so that it becomes difficult to distinguish the + from the
  —
      pattern.    With a wider sparking distance the secondary are indeed
 contained within the primary, but closely border upon them.          And as
 the sparking distance widens, the secondary figures retreat inwards
 towards the centres.       Finally, when the distance is increased to such
 an extent that no spark passes, the central figure becomes very incon
 spicuous ; the + becomes very much to resemble the straggling lines
 of the Lichtenberg figure, and the — becomes an irregular cloud.          In
 these observations it is seen that where the conditions for a vigorous
oscillation of the current are favoured the multiple character of the
figures grows      more marked.
    (3.) Various powders were tried in the production of these figures
— charcoal, French chalk, very fine emery, mixed sulphur and red
lead, the protoxide and peroxide of tin.           The last two powders, the
oxides of tin, differed in. some respects in their behaviour from the
others.     They exhibited, indeed, faintly, the types of pattern observed
with the use of lycopodium, but took in addition a ring-like formation
round the poles, the rings being irregular and wavy and sometimes
                                                                  a 2

very numerous.      All tbe other powders behaved like lycopodium, but
showed less perfectly developed figures.
    (4.) When a plate has been exposed to the action of the spark in
producing these dust-figures, the powder which before was loose on the
surface  of the plate will be found to have become fixed, or to a con
siderable extent adherent, to the plate where the figure has been
formed, and continues to remain so for many weeks ; so far as I have
observed, indeed, indefinitely.
   If a plate bearing a dust-figure be laid by and subsequently (a
couple of weeks later) be dusted clean and then breathed upon, breath-
figures, differing in the finer detail from those formed on the powder,
appear.    They more nearly resemble the curious photographic figures
obtained recently by Mr. Brown, by passing coil sparks over photo
graphic dry plates (' Philosophical Magazine,' December, 1888).
Brisk rubbing, or washing with soap and water, destroys the " magic "
qualities of these breath-figure plates.       I have not obtained these
breath-figures at all so distinctly developed on plates which had very
recently been sparked over.      It would appear that a certain lapse of
time is necessary to confer this quality on the plate.     Breath-figures
of somewhat similar character have been noticed before.
    (5.) Formed in an atmosphere of coal gas, the patterns show' a
marked variation.
    In the negative a very regular, halo-like ring surrounds the pole,
through which the characteristic cloudy fronds of the negative pattern
break out, as it wrere, in places, extending further on the plate.    The
 + pattern appears in the centre of the halo.         The development of
spark veins is less conspicuous.
    In the positive there is less variation from the normal pattern in
air. There are fewer spark veins, and hence less branching.           The
characters are more those of an irregular outline, with deep mossy
edging.
    Formed in hydrogen, the negative is reduced to a faint, circular
halo, with a very faint positive pattern within.         No spark veins
observable.     The  positive pattern    shows   only a few  thin, sharp-
branching spark veins, fragmentary and radiate to the pole, with an
indefinite aggregation of the powder around them.
    Formed in carbon dioxide, there is no notable change from the figures
 formed in air.    The distinction between the two patterns, the -f and
 — , is perhaps better developed, there being some increased likeness
 with the Lichtenberg figures.
    When the figures are developed under the receiver of an air-pump
at diminished air pressure it is found that at a pressure of 15" of
mercury the negative form appeared very much as in coal gas, i.e.,
 with a regular halo, having straight radiate marking, few and faint
spark veins and a mossy positive pattern near its centre. The positive

                   Observations   on the Spark Discharge.                   71
 form had a mossy outline, with but little branching and few and faint
 spark veins.     Then a negative cloud-edged pattern, with finally a
 second    mossy development of the + form at the centre.               At 10"
 pressure the   —  pattern was a very regular halo, with uniform texture.
 No spark veins, and central mossy + form.              The + pattern was a
 mossy    edging, with a second mossy pattern at the centre and an
 intermediate undisturbed region, in which no definite marking could
 be detected.   At 6" pressure the halo of the — form is more extended,
 very faint, and shows the moss pattern at its centre. No spark veins.
 The + form consists of a few coarse, straggling lines, extending
towards the centre, a region within of unmarked powder, and a few
more thick straggling lines wandering from the centre.               All these
thick lines show a central core of unmoved powder, each, in fact, con
sisting of two parallel lines in which the powder has beeu removed,
leaving an undisturbed central axis.         No spark veins.
    In air at 3" pressure both forms have become very indistinct. The
suggestion of a halo in the negative : a little pitting here and there,
not deep enough to expose the glass, in the positive.
    It appears from these experiments that the nature of the gaseous
dielectric exerts a considerable influence on the nature of the path
taken by the outspreading current.          It would seem to be also a ques
tion as to the degree of conductivity possessed by the gas. The
ring-like symmetry of the negative pattern, as well as the generally
more symmetrical outspread of the positive, and the absence of spark
veins in both, seem to indicate a uniformity of spread of the current
in the better conducting media, as hydrogen, or air, at reduced pres
sure.     This suggests, in fact, that these dust-figures owe their forms
chiefly to the manner in which the current spreads in the surrounding
gas.    It has already been seen that the nature of the powder in general
exerts little qualitative influence. The nature of the plate carrying
the powder has yet to be dealt with.
    (6.) Formed on the surface of a sheet of vulcanite, the figures
exhibited no distinguishing feature from those on glass.               Thus it
appears    that  a difference  of  specific   inductive  capacity (vulcanite is
two-thirds that of glass, according to Gordon) does not appear to
affect what influence the non-conducting plate may exert on the form
of the figure. It will now appear, however, that the isotropic quality
or otherwise of the plate is an important factor in determining the
path taken by the current.
    A plate of selenite cleaved on the clinodiagonal, measuring about,
6x7 cm.,       was polished   smooth   on opposite faces, having been re
duced to a thickness of about 4 mm. Owing to perforations, due to
loose crystallisation, the crystal had to be laid down on glass with
melted paraffin. Dust-figures taken on this crystalline surface showed
a very marked variation from those effected on glass. This is espe

Tl                                Mr.   J. Joly.
cially observable in the positive figure. The straggling lines of the
tufts on this pattern are distorted considerably into the direction of
cleavage of the crystal.        The outlying " crow's feet," common on
these figures,      are symmetrically oriented with reference to the
cleavage.      The  entire figure, indeed, evinces unequal development in
directions coinciding with the cleavage of the crystal. Wiedemann
describes experiments on the conductivity of crystals by discharge
from a Leyden jar over dusted surfaces.         The dust was thrown into a
ring more or less elliptical, according     to the degree in which the con
ductivity of the crystal differed in different directions. (' Poggendorff's
Annalen,' vol. 76 (1849), p. 406).
    It would be interesting to try the effects on stressed dielectrics.
An attempt of my own to deal with stressed glass failed ultimately
from want of adequate means of putting a uniform and sufficient
stress on the material.
    The. distortion of the figure produced by an unequally conducting
plate shows that the plate, as might be expected, shares in the con
duction of the current, which it will do more or less, of course,
according to the degree of conductivity it possesses compared with
that of the gaseous dielectric.         The characters of the figures are,
however, probably conferred by the gas, the parts of which being
isolated and mobile will tend to favour want of uniformity in the
discharge, losing equilibrium under small electrostatic stresses.
    (7.) Figures may be formed by inductive action exerted through
the dielectric plate.
    A glass plate, dusted on both sides, is supported about 5 mm. above
a smooth metallic surface which is placed in contact with one pole of
the coil.     The other pole touches the upper surface of the plate cen
trally.     On the current passing a figure is formed on the upper
surface corresponding to the pole in contact with     it,  and on the lower
surface a pattern of the opposite kind, but less distinct.          Looking
 through the plate,     it   isseen that these figures are fairly superim
 posed, i.e., the outline of the + form corresponds with the outline of
the — form.        If two glass plates be laid one above Another separated
 by  3   or
         4     mm.,   the lower resting on metal, the figure on the upper
surface of the lower plate corresponds in a feeble way to the figure on
the upper surface of the upper plate.         Similar inductive effects were
observed by Mr. Brown in the case of his photographic figures
 (loc. cit.).
     (8.) If a plate be dusted on both sides and touched at each side
centrally by one of the poles, figures may be formed by direct action
on both sides of the plate.         The plate may be held in a vertical
 position. When the dielectric plate         isthin the coincidence of the
figures so formed  is    very remarkable.   Thus,  taken in a plate a couple
of millimetres in thickness, every tuft of the pattern on the       +   side

•covers a   cloud on the negative.     The branching spark veins, too, cor
 respond or overlie closely.      Sometimes, however, the coincidence of
 these latter is not perfect, for, if a plate be dusted and breathed on
 upon both sides, the spark veins, then showing       out more clearly, are
 seen to diverge a little in some cases.
    That this coincidence of development        at each side of the plate    is
 inductive and not ascribable to luminous action,          possibly initially
 developed     on one side and then determining by         its influence dis
 charge along certain paths on the other, is shown         by repeating the
 experiment on red photographic glass, when the            coincidence is as
 striking as before.
    It  is hard to make out the exact nature of the coincidence. It
 does not appear      to be that of photographic positive and negative
throughout.       However, the clear margin around the clouds on the —
 pattern is invariably backed by the marginal frill of the + pattern.
 It is interesting and curious to observe in the dark this inductive
 transmission of the current across a sheet of clean glass, arranged
as in the above experiment.        The close but not perfect coincidence of
 the spark veins is then easily noticeable.
    (9.) If a bundle of plates making up about a centimetre in thick
 ness be arranged as in the last experiment (i.e., the extreme surfaces
 powdered and touched centrally by the poles), the figures no longer
show the coincidence observed in the experiment with the thin di
electric, but are smaller and more of the Lichtenberg type.          That is,
 the + tends to be more straggling and tufted, the          —  more rounded
and lobed. The inductive action is here feebler, and matters are
more as    in Lichtenberg's experiment.
    (10.)  On  the other hand, diminishing the thickness of the dielectric
gives rise to figures of great minuteness and detail. With very thin
dielectrics it is difficult any longer to distinguish the + pattern from
the — .     If such thin dielectrics be laid down on a metallic surface as
in the first-described experiment (1), the extreme delicacy of form is
still obtained. In this way the figures of Plate 2 were formed upon
a sheet of the thin glass used for microscopic cover glasses.             Still
greater    delicacy  may   be  obtained   by using thin sheets  of  mica,  but
ultimately the piercing of the plate bj- the spark sets a limit to the
experiments. In these experiments the conditions are those for a very
strong inductive action. The double nature of each figure is apparent
in these as well as in the former figures, and the similarity, or perhaps
identity, of the forms of opposite sign is very well seen by comparing
the inner with the outer of these patterns.
    (11.) Figures taken on opposite sides of a thin insulator at
diminished air pressure present some peculiarities.           A thin plate of
micro-cover glass was arranged to stand vertically beneath the re
ceiver of an air-pump, the poles touching it centrally at each side.

  74                                Mr.  J. Joly.
  Figures obtained on both sides of this plate at pressures in the re
  ceiver of over 15" of mercury showed much the same minutely divided
  patterns, in which the + is hardly distinguishable from the — , as
   occur at ordinary pressures. At about 15" pressure, however, a sudden
   transition in the nature of the figures occurs.       The negative becomes
   very indistinct, a hazy ring with little veining. The positive becomes
   a few long straggling lines, radiate to the centre.         So abrupt is the
  transition that a plate was obtained on which about one-third, or 120°,
  of the first sort of pattern was definitely replaced by a sector of the
  second sort, a faint halo on the negative and a ring of straggling
   radiate lines backing it on the positive side.
      As the pressure diminishes the second order of pattern persists and
  develops.    The positive ring spreads outwards, the straggling lines of
   which it consists becoming shorter. The negative grows so indistinct
   as to be no longer easily located on the plate ; it is found, however,
   backing the positive ring on close observation.       Ultimately both forms
  disappear from the plate, the positive persisting at pressures at which
  the negative is quite indiscoverable.
     It would appear from all these observations that where the discharge
  is chiefly in the gaseous dielectric it is to some property of this
  medium that the peculiar characters of the patterns are to be ascribed.
  Faraday's view that much of the individualities of positive and nega
  tive brushes, sparks, &c., was to be ascribed to the behaviour of the
  matter conveying the current may possibly be an approximation to
 the truth in the present case, although affording no insight into the
  manner in which such a remarkable distinction in the nature of
  the figures can be brought about by a difference in the behaviour of
 the gaseous matter towards positive and negative discharges.             This
 view is, however,      I  think, rather confirmed by the lessening of the
 distinction   between    the  patterns as the dielectric plate gets thinner,
 for it is probable that in the case of a thin screen separating
 the discharges      these occur to a greater extent in the matter of
 the screen, the parts of which, yielding only slightly to stresses,
refuse to show any distinguishing behaviour towards positive or
negative.
     That the distinguishing features of the positive and negative pat
 terns vary with the nature of the matter which shares with the gas
in carrying the discharge is apparent, from Mr. Brown's results, in
air discharges over photographic plates. The photographic film in
this   case  probably possessed a considerable degree of conductivity,
and so modified the air discharge.            In the case of the peroxide and
protoxide of tin there was also, as already observed, a modifying, or
at least a superadded, effect.         It is probable that with the use of
lycopodium      there  is  with  thick  plates little modification of the air
discharge. The next experiment is a case in point, although much of

the detail observed may result from the fact that the powder was fine
and adherent to the glass.
  (12.) A glass plate was held over burning magnesium ribbon till a
fairly even sublimate of magnesia covered its surface.     On this a

discharge was taken, resting the glass on a conductor. It is to be
observed, in the first place, that the figures obtained on this surface do
not generally penetrate to the glass, but are impressed on the surface
of the sublimate.      At the same time, the grain is exceedingly fine,
bearing   examination   with a high power under the microscope. Taken
on   ordinary glass (such as is used in photography), the negative
exhibits a centre of fine bent veins and a faint but very beautiful,
irregular halo, with wavy border, extending in the direction of the
positive pole.   The positive most resembles the outspread tentacles of
some of the larger sea anemones (fig. 1), but the tentacles, magnified,
are seen to have the curious structure sketched in fig. 2. Their extreme

points are deeply sunken in the powder, and they sometimes bifurcate
at the extremity and curl round, meeting each other in a very peculiar
way. Each contains a central core of undisturbed material ; they are,
in fact, outlined only. On thin glass very delicate figures are obtained.
The positive somewhat resembles Mr. Brown's photographs for that
pole — veins bordered with innumerable streaming lines.             The nega
tive  shows   a strong resemblance       to  the   positive, being, in fact, a
similar pattern with finer streamers. In this last case again we might
suppose that the discharge was shared to a greater extent by the
sublimate, and differences between the positive and negative gas dis
charges accordingly reduced.
   The undisturbed core in the spark lines has been observed in the
case of spark tracks over smoked glass (Topler).            It is developed in
breath-figures,  or is  seen  when  sparks    from   a Holtz machine, or from

 a jar, are passed  over emery dusted on glass. The phenomenon recalls
 the shallow penetration of transient currents in conductors, and sug
 gests that possibly the inflow of energy from the surrounding medium
 is not, in these cases of heavy sparks, concentrated          to form linear dis-
 rnption, but   disruption on a cylindrical surface.
    (13.) To investigate in some measure the effects of the discharge in
 the substance of the dielectric plate, a plate of ordinary glass was
 employed, having its upper surface flooded with melted paraffin, kept
 fluid by resting the glass on a warm sheet of metal.            During discharge
 a ridge or mound of the liquid paraffin was repelled              into the region
 between the poles extending nearly across the plate, and always nearer
 to the negative pole.     Around the poles the paraffin was repelled as if
     a
by strong      wind,  leaving a circle of glass clean and bare. The circle
 was largest round the positive pole.         Beyond this a radial puckering
 of the surface of the fluid could be observed.           By allowing the glass
 to cool while continuing the action of the coil, these phenomena could
 be examined in the solid paraffin.       It was curious to observe that as
 cooling progressed isolated heaps of paraffin gathered from the sur
 rounding fluid, principally near the negative pole, when cold standing
 5 or 6 mm. above the general level — possibly a surface tension effect.
 Short lengths of finely -cut up copper wire scattered over the plate
 while the paraffin was still fluid gathered towards the poles, and,
 with mnch gyration and oscillation, set themselves radially to the
 poles and along lines of flow between the poles.            In many cases they
 struggled into the vacant ring close to the pole, and moved about till
 they gradually built up lines reaching from the edge of the paraffin
 nearly to the pole.     In some places they set themselves into a kind of
 network, attaching themselves together, end to end, as if magnetised.
 These appearances were observed on cooling.               Very remarkable are
 innumerable whirls and eddies to be found            on  the frozen surface, in
 some cases   so minute as only to be defined with a strong lens.
    Similar phenomena were observed using fluid paraffin oil.                They
 reveal the    presence   of stresses  in  the   dielectric   accompanying     dis
charges,    which the rigid nature of the glass refuses to show, and
 suggest   the degree to which discharge takes place in the plate.
            Some Phenomena      Occurring   in the  Path of Discharge.
    The degradation of energy taking place in an electric discharge
through a gaseous medium is complex in character.                        There is
development      of heat,  probably   according     to  the   laws   of Ohm    and
Joule; kinetic energy imparted to the molecules by electrostatic re
pulsion and attraction, and chemical potential energy in the liberated
ions.    The liberation of ions cannot be supposed to occur in the same
manner as in liquid electrolytes.       In the latter case the actual expendi

78                            Mr.  J. Joly.
ture of energy is confined to the immediate surface of the poles.        In
the spark the expenditure of energy is continuous from pole to pole.
The abundance with which ions are liberated precludes the idea that
they are liberated only at the poles.       This distinction is doubtless
ascribed partly to the free motion and isolation of the molecules dis
integrated by the spark, partly owing to the explosive disturbance
and dispersion of the atoms.      For heating, repulsion, and chemical
dissociation will unite in setting up a violent rush of atoms and
molecules from the axis of the spark outwards, in fact, conferring its
explosive character upon it.
   The following observations for the most part find their explanation
in the mechanical conditions obtaining in the spark path and relate
to the behaviour of the spark in passing through confined spaces.
   (14. ) Two leads of very thin platinum foil are laid down on a slip
of glass.    The leads are about 30 mm. in length by 1 mm. in width.
The glass slip may be an ordinary microscope slip. The leads are laid
along the slip in the same straight line, with their ends (preferably
cut to points) separated by about 20 mm. at the centre.         A piece of
thin cover glass is now cut into a rectangular shape, 40 x 20 mm. q.p.,
warmed and touched on one side at each corner with shellac.          This is
laid down centrally on the slip, covering the gap between the leads,
and the whole is held over a flame till the shellac between the cover
glass and the slip begins to melt.    It is then placed on a smooth table
and the cover pressed and rubbed down till Newton's rings appear in
the space separating the leads.      This is easily accomplished if the
surfaces   have  been wiped clean before putting them together.         The
rubbing is continued till the black spot is produced at the centre of
the rings.
    If wires from a Ruhmkorff coil are now brought to touch the leads
where they extend beyond the cover glass, it will be seen that the
spark in its passage across the confined space between the cover
glass and the slip refuses to cross the centre of the rings.      It makes
a detour, curving round at a distance of four or more rings from the
black spot, that is, it will sometimes pass in the fourth ring, some
times in the sixth or eighth.   It will often divide into several sparks,
some going one side, some going the other.          These sparks show no
difference in appearance from free sparks.         The rings will be seen
to be disturbed by the sparks, generally widening as if the glasses
came closer.     In some cases, however, they soon become destroyed.
It is observable, however, that sparks passed through such a narrow
space will often produce the rings where none at first existed.        Such
rings persist for many hours, so that    the  effect i* hardly due  to heat
ing, but probably due to an electrostatic straining jf the glass.
   It appears from this experiment that the spark experiences a higher
 resistance near the centre of the rings, either because the molecules

                      Observations on   the  Spark Discharge.                   79
 are there    constrained in their motion or are fewer in number. If an
 external by-path be arranged, the spark will often prefer to clear as
 much as 5 cm. of free air to passing a distance of 1*8 cm. between the
 glasses.     Accurate measurements         were not attempted, for with the
 apparatus      used it would evidently have been difficult to have
 arranged that definite conditions should obtain as to the space be
 tween the glasses.
     On  arranging the slip beneath the receiver of an air pump so that
 the  path of the spark can be observed at low pressures it is some
 times, not always, seen that at low pressures            the curvature of the
 spark    increases.    It may-move    outwards    by  three or more rings, tin-
 rings themselves remaining unaltered.           When the pressure is much
 reduced it becomes difficult any longer to keep the spark between
 the glasses.      It chooses then some external path.
    (15.) In the last experiments after the first half-dozen sparks were
 passed     through the straitened space between the glasses a faint
 etched line becomes apparent at the place where the constraint was
 greatest, i.e., close to the rings.      The formation of this line may be
 observed.       It is accompanied by a local brightening of the spark and
 an emission of sodium tinted rays as if the glass was being volatilized.
 The line will preserve the curve described by the spark.              It may be
 as long as 4 or 5 mm. or merely a speck.
    On placing this under the microscope the line is resolved               into a
 very beautiful and regular         structure,  diatom-like   in  its delicacy of
 marking.       Fig. 1, PI. 3 is a photograph of such a spark track magni
 fied 64 diameters.        The width of the track is about one-tenth of a
 millimetre, but this is slightly variable.         Measurements of the side
 rays show that they ai'e from 330 to 420 to the millimetre.               Such a
 track may be deepened and lengthened by repeatedly passing the
spark, the side rays remaining apparently undisturbed in position,
but widening a little and lengthening a little, so that a track which
is a very faint impression when first examined may be submitted
again to the current and gradually brought up.                 It will be found
too in this process that the pitted central core of the track widens
and sinks deeper into the glass.          The contrast between a fresh and a
worn track is interesting.         In the former none of the central pitting
is developed, but the side rays meet at the centre somewhat as shown
in the cut (fig. 3).           If the glasses be taken asunder it will be
                                       Fig.  3.

 80                                 Mr.  J. Joly.
 found that both glasses have shared in the marking, seemingly to
 an equal extent.       The marks, too, are apparently vis a vis.
    What has caused this structure ? The answer is, I think, not hard
 to find.    In the first place these marks are melted in the glass. Their
 rounded contours and ridges leave no doubt of this. They are quite
 distinct in appearance from the hair-like cracks to be observed
 extending from the track at more or less regular intervals.             If the
 spark be regarded as a line of explosion from which atoms raised to a
 high temperature are being repelled, the effects observed are quite
explicable. These atoms, in the free spark escaping all round, are here
 compelled to make their escape by the narrow side ways only.               The
side rays depict the lanes of escape cut by the heated, outrushing
 molecules.      Shift the slide under the microscope till the extremity of
 track is approached.       Here the " head-room " is increasing.        Fig. 2,
 Pl. 3, is a photograph of such a part of the track. Here there is a
relief of pressure in the longitudinal direction. The outrush becomes
more axial along the spark.           Not quite axial, because there is also a
possible sideway escape        and  the  lines brush out in the intermediate
direction of easiest escape. Hence the tracks generally end up in
these beautiful feathery forms.
    Occasionally the spark reaches a point in its path where side
escape is difficult or impossible.         It then assumes the appearance of
fig.  1,  PI. 4.   The   central   part  is  much pitted and lines of escape
appear diverging at each end.              This is perhaps in some respects
remarkable.       It might be thought that the unidirectional current
would polarize the motion of the atoms, but it would appear as if the
atoms, having received their energy from the ether, were left unin
fluenced sensibly by any stress or motion iu the medium to polarize
their movements, other than their tendency to move from the spark
axis in a radial direction.       In fact the directions of longitudinal flow
are apparently obedient to conditions of pressure only, or seem at
least sufficiently explained by such.
   The lines on the concave side of a sharply curved track are shorter
by a little than those on the convex side.          The reason of this is that
escape is not so free on the inner side.         Passing round sharp obstacles
accidentally occurring      in  the  path,  the axis of the spark track is close
in near the obstacles, the lines chiefly radiating outwards.
   I made up a slide in which a couple of very fine lines had been
engraved with an etching diamond on the surface of the slip, extend
ing across the field at right angles to the path of the spark. On
passing sparks it was found that for a little distance at either
side of the point where the track crossed these lines the side rays
were discontinued, evincing the relief of pressure afforded by the
channels.
   When a spark bifurcates the course             of the outrushing   atoms   is

                     Observations on the Spark Discharge.                  81
   shown in (fig. 2, PI. 4).      It is probable that in this figure we are
   looking at a point on the spark track where a considerable outflow of
   atoms initiated a divergence of the spark or a bifurcation of it.
      (16.) To investigate the nature of these tracks a slide was experi
   mented   with when exposed to the reduced air pressure of 10" of
   mercury.    The spark tracks produced at this pressure were found
   devoid of the side rays.    Instead, beads of melted glass had arranged
   themselves along the centre of the track, some drawn out into long
  streaks, others globular.     Another slide at 12" pressure showed very
   rudimentary development of the rays.             At 20'' some rays were
  obtained, but all these slides treated at ordinary pressures rapidly
  developed side rays, sometimes bordering the old tracks.           The low-
  pressure tracks, it is to be observed, often develop a budded appearance-
  at irregular     intervals, as if the accumulated pressure was con
  tent ivith an occasional relief.       The buds open outwards from the
  sides and ends of the track, fanwise.       These are often quite smooth r
  but develop grooved lines or rays when treated at ordinary pressures.
  They, in fact, experience a more intense outrush of matter at high
  pressures than at low pressures.
      Why a track can be intensified by repetition of the spark is easily
  understood.      The channels of escape once indicated by the faintest
  grooving   will  naturally continue their functions at the passage of each
  spark, and in this way become deepened.
      (17.) It has frequently been shown that on glass there is a surface
  condensation of moisture.        To find if this had a part in the produc
  tion of the rays, slides were made up of glasses which had just cooled
 after being heated to redness over a Bunsen burner.           The results of
 several experiments showed that the rays were obtained               without
 difficulty, but perhaps not quite so readily as on slides which had only
 been rubbed clean in the usual way.         The effect of the surface layer
 of moisture is slight, almost inappreciable.
     (18.) The regular spacing of the rays might suggest that the free
 path of the atoms or molecules might determine              in some degree
 their spacing.       To test this question the slides were arranged for
experiment      in  an atmosphere of hydrogen.       Great care was taken by
a preliminary heating of the glasses composing the slides and sub
sequent frequent exhaustions, after each exhaustion admitting hydro
gen around the slide, to withdraw all air from the space between the
glasses.     The tracks obtained in this atmosphere of hydrogen turned
out to be very similar, generally, to those obtained in air ; in places-
quite indistinguishable        from them.      In some places, however, a
striking distancing      ov  widening   of the  side lines is observed.   The
lines here are thicker, shorter, and gapped, i.e., one ray is not con
tinued unbroken from the axis, but is divided by minute gaps.
Measurements showed such lines to be spaced about 250 to the milli

82                              Mr. J. Joly.
metre.     But again measurements     in other places, where the spacing
was finer, gave similar numbers to those obtained in the case of air,
rising to 420 to the millimetre.
    It seems probable, in the first place, that somo air will linger in
these narrow spaces.     This might explain the occurrence of the finer
spacing. However, granting this, it is not certain that a wider
spacing of the lines in the ease of hydrogen may not be explained on
its superior conductivity or inferior density. These qualities might
very conceivably influence the intensity and effects of the outrush
from the spark axis.     The spacing of the lines might, in fact, be con
sidered as dependent on the accumulation of pressure at points along
the axis of the spark.    When this accumulation at any point becomes
sufficiently intense it breaks out, cutting a channel.     It might easily
be supposed that such points, where the conditions were uniform
along the path of the spark, would be very evenly spaced.          The dis
tance separating such points might depend on many properties of the
gas, as its conductivity, specific heat, density, and pressure.    There is
not then, I think, sufficient reason to suppose that there is anything
in common between these marks and the striae observed in vacuum-
tubes.    The explanation just given seems quite adequate to explain
the formation of the marks, but no mere modification of such an ex
planation will fit in with many of the observations on striae.         The
conditions obtaining are really quite different in the two cases.
    (19.) Whether the period of electric oscillation of the spark path
and leads had an influence in determining the spacing of these lines,
was investigated by an experiment on a slide in which the dimensions
had been altered till nearly double the ordinary size.          The tracks
obtained in this, however, presented no peculiarities.
    (20.) Observations on the appearance of the spark, confined between
the glasses, in the field of the microscope, using a magnification of
about 60 diameters, revealed no visible peculiarity.      Nor did the use
of a wedge of neutral tinted glass, introduced to lessen the dazzling
 light, enable any detail to be grasped.      When, however, passing in
a narrow space, the sparks could be seen rapidly melting the glass.
 Photography of the sparks thus magnified was also tried. The
 photographs show a bright central part, hazy border, and — very
 faintly — flame-like streamers extending rectangularly          from the
 border and to some two or three diameters of the sparks at either
 side.
     (21.) The following experiment is explained in an outrush of
  matter uniformly from all points along the spark. Into a piece of
  thermometer tubing about 0.2 mm. in bore and about 4 cm. in length,
  two leads of very fine, straight platinum wire are laid loosely. They
  are separated in the tube by about 1 cm.     Let this gap be situated at
  a distance of 1 cm. from one end, and therefore 2 cm. from the other,

                      Observations   on the Spark Discharge.                   83
  and   connect   with a coil  so that sparks pass. If now a stream of coal -
  pu be passed across the end of the tube nearest the spark, two-thirds
   of the length of the spark near this end will become coloured             with
   the bine tint assumed by a spark in coal-gas at atmospheric         pressures,
  the remainder of the spark length remaiuing as before.            Altering the
  direction of the current does not influence the result.         If the coal-gas
   be passed across the other extremity of the tube, the one-third of the
  spark length near that end becomes blue, the other two-thirds con-
   tinning an air spark.
      More the spark gap into the middle of the tube and repeat the
  experiment.      Now it is seen that half the spark turns bl ue when the
  eas is approached       to one end ; always that half nearest the end
  opening into the current of gas.
      If finally, a flame of any kind be approached one end of the tube,
  at each spark the flame is seen to be blown outwards as if acted on
  by a blow-pipe.       The explanation of the coloration of the coal-gas is
  to be found in a back suction of gas occurring           after each explosion,
  the succeeding spark becoming coloured according to the distribution
  of gas in the tube.      This is a question of facility of egress and ingress.
  When the spark is centrally placed in the tube these are equal at each
  end, and half the spark will be coloured.              In the unsymmetrical
  position of the spark, outflow and inflow are facilitated at one end
 and obstructed at the other according as the spark is located nearer
 the one end and further from the other.
     When a spark is caused to pass in the centre of a tube so long as
  10 or 12 cm., the puffing out of a flame applied at the end may still
 be observed, but there is no coloration of the spark when coal-gas              is
 passed across the end.         It fails to penetrate so far along the tube as
 to reach    the spark.
     The    partial   coloration of the spark, taking place in this very
 symmetrical way, must evidently depend              on a uniform repulsion of
 matter along the length of the spark.                Were the molecules, for
 example, only repelled         close   to the positive pole the symmetry of
 efecte would hardly obtain.
     (22.) In addition to the fine rays bordering the spark tracks in
 more worn tracks, the arrangement of the melted glass is note
 worthy.      ¦Very often three strings of glass beads are discernible, a
 central one of large beads or globules, spherical or elongated, and a
string of very small spherical globules extending along either side.
 All are contained in a smooth trough-shaped track.                  Occasionally
the globules        are, however, differently arranged.          Thus the tiny
somewhat V -shaped marks, all pointing one way, shown in (fig. 1,
PI. 5), consist of very minute beads ; the largest at the apex, the
-mailer streaming backwards and outwards like the wash from the
bow of an advancing boat.            Observations show that this arrangement

may occur reversed       in order in the same slide, i.e., the pattern may
point   towards  either  pole.*
    (23 ) A  few of  the  cracks which cross the spark tracks are seen on
the last figure  and    on the other figures.       When the spark traverses
wider places cracks alone appear, and these are sometimes very regular
in appearance.      It would appear that these are the result of electro
static stresses in the glass exerted orthogonally to the lines of flow.
Thus, near the poles these cracks curve round the pole with a small
radius of curvature, the curves flatten as they are further removed
from the pole and in the centre of the field cross the line joining the
poles perpendicularly.       Intersecting these orthogonally are the spark
tracks, which, in cases where the glasses are at a uniform but short
distance from one another throughout, or parallel, appear to pass in
elliptical lines from pole to pole. Fig. 2, PI. 5, is a photo magnified
fifteen diameters of the field near the positive pole. It will be seen that
it recalls the usual figures of the distribution of equipotential lines
and lines of flow for such a disposition of the poles.           It is remarkable
that near the negative pole the flow lines often curve outwards at
some little distance from the pole.         If free sparks, taken from carbon
points or dusty terminals, be observed, the luminous particles of
burning carbon or dust will be seen to have the same outward curva
ture at the — pole.        Those at the + pole curve elliptically towards
the negative (fig. 4).

    (24.) The homogeneousuess of the glass is essential to all the fore
 going effects. A plate of Iceland spar was polished parallel to a
rhombohedral cleavage face. On this a thin cover glass was laid
down over platinum leads as before and sparks passed. Search for
tracks of the usual appearance on this was in vain ; different
phenomena presented themselves.             The track was marked by innu
merable little pits with raised, rounded edges, running on the
whole in cleavage directions, i.e., dividing up the surface into
rhombohedral pits. These pits look as if they had been melted into
    * The cloudy marking at either  side of the track seen in the figure is due to
moisture which had penetrated between the glasses before the photograph -was
taken. In the case of the other photographs the glasses were separated before
photographing, the figures being obtained from one of the glasses only.

the surface   of the crystal.     Fine cracks, set along the spark tracks,
quite distinct from the pitting, and bent in cleavage directions, add
to the curious appearance in the field of the microscope.           Sometimes
a track approximating to those obtained on glass is met with, but the
side rays are bent and distorted.          I found, also, that the appearance
of the tracks varied with the direction which the spark took in re
ference to the cleavage lines.
    A similar experiment on a plate of selenite gave like results, the
pits being more elongated in accordance with the more acute cleavage
intersection.     Mica plates showed a fine net of hexagonally arranged
lines covering the surface where the spark had passed.                 Further
experiments    in  this direction  might be    of interest, but other work  has
hindered me from pursuing the subject.
    (25.) Sparks from the Ley den jar will produce tracks on glass
 similar to those described in the foregoing ; but experimenting with
 snch sparks is difficult, as thei» very explosive nature leads to a rapid
 break up of the cover glass.

   In a paper presented to the Royal Society in 1887 — 18R8, and
printed in vol. 180 of the 'Philosophical Transactions,' we discussed
the   history and the present position of the question of the sources of
the nitrogen of vegetation.        We referred      to the conclusions arrived
at about thirty years ago from the results         of Boussingault and from
those obtained at Rothamsted, up to that time.            We gave the results
of some experiments which had been recently made at Rothamsted in
connexion with the subject, and reviewed the evidence and conclusions
of others published within the last few years.
    It was considered that the earlier results obtained by Boussingault, "
                                                                    h 2

and at Rothamsted, under conditions in which the action both of elec
 tricity and of microbes was excluded, were conclusive against the sup
 position that, under such conditions, the higher chlorophyllous plants
 can directly fix the free nitrogen of the atmosphere, either by their
 leaves or otherwise.     Others have, indeed, come to the conclusion
 that at any rate some plants do directly fix the free nitrogen of the
 air by their leaves. We believe, however, that there is, up to the
 present time, no evidence which can be held to be conclusive in favour
 of such a view.
    It was pointed out how large was the store of already existing com
 bined nitrogen in many soils and subsoils, and evidence was adduced to
 show that even Leguminosae derive, at any rate a considerable amount
of nitrogen from nitric acid within the soil and subsoil ; and, further,
 that it was, as a rule, those having the most powerful root-develop-
ineni that took up the most nitrogen from somewhere ; and it was
considered that this fact pointed to a .subsoil source.
    Upon the whole it was concluded that, at any rate in the case of
our gramineous, our cruciferous, our chenopodiaceous, and our solane-
ous crops, atmospheric nitrogen was not the source. It was admitted,
however, that existing evidence was insufficient to explain the source
of the whole of the nitrogen of the LeguminostB.
    According to some of the more recent experimenters, the fixation
of free nitrogen is not limited to our leguminous crops; and the
modes of explanation of the gains of nitrogen observed are extremely
various.    Thus, it is assumed — that combined nitrogen has been
absorbed from the air, either by the soil or by the plant ; that there is
fixation of free nitrogen within the soil by the agency of porous and
alkaline bodies ; that there is fixation by the plant itself ; that there
is fixation within the soil by the agency of electricity ; and, finally,
that there is fixation under the influence of micro-organisms within
the soil, with, or even without, the accompanying growth of higher
plants.
   The balance of the evidence recorded seemed to be undoubtedly iu
favour of the supposition that there is fixation under the influence of
micro-organisms or of other low forms within the soil, and of all the
various results which were discussed, those of Hellriegel and Wilfarth
were considered to be by far the most definite and significant ; point
ing to the conclusion that, although the higher chlorophyllous plants
may not directly utilise the free nitrogen of the air, some of them, at
any rate, may acquire nitrogen brought into combination under the
influence of lower organisms, the development of which is, appa
rently, in some cases, a coincident of the growth of the higher plant
whose nutrition they are to serve.     Such a conclusion is, however, of
such fundamental importance that it seemed very desirable that it
should be confirmed by independent investiga'ion.

  1890.]     On  the Question   of   the Fixation of Free Nitrogen.       87
     Accordingly,   as stated  in a postscript to our paper, dated October,
  1888, it had been decided to institute experiments at Rothamsted on
  similar lines, and a preliminary series was then in progress. ' A
  second and more      extended     series  has been conducted   in the past
  season,  1889.     It is proposed to give, on the present occasion, a
  description,   and some of the numerical results, of the experiments
  made in 1888, and a description, and some illustrations, of the growth
  in those of 1889.
     It was in 1883 that    Hellriogel commenced a comprehensive series
  of vegetation experiments        in pots, in which he grew agricultural
  plants of various families in washed quartz sand.       To all of the pots
  nutritive solutions containing no nitrogen were added ; to one series
  nothing else was supplied ; to a second a fixed quantity of nitrogen as
 sodium nitrate ; to a third twice as much ; and to a fourth four times
  as much was added. The result was that, in the case of the Gramineae,
 and some other plants, the growth was largely proportional to the
 nitrogen supplied, whilst in that of the Papilionaceae it was not so.
 In the case of these plants, that of peas for example, it was observed,
 however, that in a series of pots to which no nitrogen was added,
 most of the plants were apparently limited in their grow1h by the
 amount of nitrogen which the seed supplied; whilst here and there
 a plant growing ostensibly under the same conditions would develop
 very luxuriantly ; and, on examination, it was found that whilst no
 nodules were developed on the roots of the plants of limited growth,
 they were abundant on those of the plants that grew luxuriantly.
    In view of this result, Hellriegel instituted experiments to deter
 mine whether, by the supply of the organisms, the formation of the
 root-nodules, and luxuriant growth, could be induced, and whether bv
 their exclusion the result could be prevented.       To this end, he added
 to some of a series of experimental pots 25 c.c., or sometimes 50 c.c..
 of the turbid extract of a fertile soil, made by shaking a given
quantity of it with five times its weight of distilled water.       In some
cases, however, the extract was sterilised.       In those in which it was
not sterilised there was almost uniformly luxuriant growth, and abun
dant formation of root-nodules ; but with sterilisation there was no
such result.      Consistent results were obtained with peas, vetches
and some other PapilionaceeB ; but the application of the same soil-
extract had no effect in the case of lupins, serradella, and some other
plants of the family which are known to grow more favourably on
sandy than on loamy or rich humus soils.            Accordingly, he made a
similar extract from a diluvial sandy soil where lupins were growin".
well, in which it might be supposed that the organisms peculiar to
such a soil would be present; and, on the application of this to
nitrogen-free soil, lupins grew in it luxuriantly, and nodules were
abundantly developed on their roots.

                The Experiments      at Bothamsted    in 1888.
     This preliminary series comprised experiments with peas, blue
lupins, and yellow lupins.    The peas were grown —
   1. In washed sand, with the ashes of the plant added ; but no
supply of combined nitrogen beyond a small determined amount in
the washed sand and that in the seed sown.
   2. In similarly prepared sand, but seeded with 25 c.c. of the turbid
watery extract from a rich garden soil.
   3. Duplicate of No. 2.
   4. In the rich garden soil itself.
   Each of the two descriptions of lupin was grown —
   1. In sand prepared as for the peas, but with lupin-plant-ash
instead of pea-plant-ash added.
   2. In the same washed sand, &c., but seeded with 25 c.c. of the
turbid watery extract from a sandy soil where lupins had grown
luxuriantly.
   3. In the lupin sandy soil itself.
   4. In rich garden soil.
   The twelve pots were arranged in a small greenhouse ; and distilled
water, free from ammonia, was used for watering.
   The sand employed was a yellow sand from Flitwick, in Bedford
shire, and was of the same description as is used by gardeners in the
neighbourhood for potting.      It proved, however, not to be a very
pure sand.     Thus,  after the stones and coarser portions had been
removed by sifting, the remainder was several times washed, first
with well-water and afterwards with distilled, the turbid wash
ings being poured off ; yet it was found to contain after being dried
finally for a short time in a water-bath, and mixed with the plant-ash
as mineral food, nitrogen as under : —

   The sandy soil in which lupins had grown, and from which the
watery extract was made for seeding the pots where the lupins wei-e
to grow, was still less pure; and        it,
                                       of course, was not washed, and
was only dried at about 24" C.     and, excepting that visible organic

by  soda-lime, in the lupin sand alone, and as used after mixture with
the lupin ash. The following are the mean results, in each case,

    It may be stated that, in this country, lupins are only grown as an
 agricultural crop, as food for sheep, on poor, sandy soils, on which
 little or nothing else will grow. The sand obtained for the purposes of
 the experiments was from land which had been reclaimed from a com
 mon in Suffolk, and on which no corn crop would grow; bat on which,
 when subsequently sown with blue lupins, they had grown as high as
 the hardles.     It is stated, however, that lupins grow better on good
 land, but that they are grown on sandy wastes because they will
 thrive on them when no other crop will.
    The garden soil, in the condition as analysed, contained 10. 12 per
cent. of moisture, aud two determinations of nitrogen by soda-lime
gave 0-3902 and 03936, mean 0-3919, corresponding to 0-4360 per
cent, on the soil dried at 100° C.
    The pots used were made of glazed earthenware ; and were about
 7 inches high, 6 inches in diameter at the top, and 5^ inches at the
 bottom, inside.     They had a hole half an inch in diameter at the
bottom for drainage, and another at the side near the bottom, into
which, outside, a glass tube bent upwards was fixed for aeration ;
the tube being lightly closed with cotton- wool to prevent insects getting
in.     The pots rested on slips of thick sheet glass, placed in basins
of the same glazed earthenware as the pots.
    The mineral nutriment used was as follows : — For the peas, a mixture
of 6 parts of pea-straw-ash and 1 part of pea-corn-ash ; for the blue
lupins, a mixture of 3 parts of blue lupin-straw-ash and 1 part of blue
lupin-corn-ash; for the yellow lupins, a mixture of 4 parts of yellow
lupin-&t raw-ash and 1 part of yellow lupin- corn-ash. In each case
the greater part of the mixed ash was suspended in distilled water,
and sulphuric acid added until there was a slight acid reaction ; the
rest of the ash was then added, and the whole evaporated to dryness
and re-ignited.       The ash was then very slightly alkaline to litmus.
The so-prepared ashes were mixed at the rate of 0-5 per cent, with the
greater part of the sand put into the pots ; the remainder of the sand
at the top of the pot being without ash.
    The drain hole at the bottom of each pot was loosely covered with
a piece of thick glass, 1 lb. of broken, washed, and dried flint was
then put in, next the sand with ash, and lastly the sand without ash.
The pots held from 7 to 9 lbs. of the yellow Flitwick sand, from 6 to
 7 lbs. of the lupin sand, and about 4| lbs. of the garden soil.

    The soil extracts, supposed to supply the organisms, were made by
shaking, in a large stoppered bottle, 1 part of the garden soil or lupin
sand with 5 parts of distilled water ; and after the heavier portions
had settled down, syphoning off the turbid liquid, which was then
passed through platinum ganze to separate any floating matter.                        The
liquid was again shaken before taking the quantity required for seed
ing the soils, or for analysis.          Determinations of nitric nitrogen by
Schloesing's    method,     and  of  total  nitrogen by copper oxide, gave the
following results :    —

    It is thus seen that the 25 c.c. of the garden soil extract nsed for
 seeding contained little more than f of a milligram, and the 25 c.c. of
 the lupin sand extract little more than            \  of a milligram of nitrogen          ;
 quantities which are quite immaterial considered as a supply of com
bined nitrogen.
                                       The Seeds.
     The peas were of the description known as Maple field-peas.                     Four
 lots, each of 100 seeds, weighed 27-554, 27-460, 27218, and 27.506
 grams ; giving an average weight per seed of 0-2743 gram. A large
 number of single seeds was then weighed, and those only retained
 for sowing or analysis which gave within 5 milligrams of the mean
 weight.
     In the case of the blue lupins the largest and smallest seeds were
 picked out and rejected.         Of the remainder, four separate lots of 100
  each weighed 19-2290, 19-9215, 187960, and 194580 grams, giving
 an average weight per seed of 0-1935 gram.                      A large number of
 single seeds was then weighed, and those only kept for use the weight
 of which was within 5 milligrams of the average weight.
     From the yellow lupin seed the largest were removed by sifting,
 and the smallest and those of a dark colour were picked out.                      Of the
 remainder, three separate lots of 100 each weighed 12-1060, 11-9640,
 and 116180 grams, giving an average weight per seed of 0'1190 gram.
 From these, seeds were selected for use which weighed within 5 milli
grams of the average weight.

   It  should be stated,     as  applicable to the whole of the results                as  well
 as to those recorded in the foregoing table, that nitrogen was deter
 mined by burning in a vacuum with copper oxide, and collecting and
 measuring the nitrogen and nitric oxide. In all cases, however, where
 there was sufficient material, determinations were also made by the
 soda-lime method, as a check. Nitrogen as nitrates was determined
 by Schlcesing's method.          The copper oxide determinations given in
 the table, which are those used in the subsequent calculations,
 were made upon three or four of the average selected seeds, ground
 up with the copper oxide; whilst the check soda-lime determinations
 were made on quantities taken from a bulk of ground seeds.
                       The Vegetation Experiments               in 1888.
   It  was intended to commence the experiments early in the summer,
but   the pressure of other work and the preparations necessary for the
experiments themselves, prevented the sowing of the seed until early
in August.         Nevertheless, the results obtained in this initiative
series were not only of value as affording experience on various
points, of which advantage has been taken in the conduct of the more
extended series made in 1889, but, as will be seen, they have afforded
important evidence on the main point of enquiry itself.
   The broken flints, the sand with ash, and the sand without ashler the
garden Boil, as the case may be, were weighed and put into the respective
pots at the laboratory, taken to the glass-honse on August 4, and
watered with ammonia-free distilled water.                       All the seeds were sown
on August 6. Three accurately weighed seeds were put into each pot.
   From the first, the peas germinated and grew well in each of the

92             Sir J. B. Lawes and Prof.    J. H. Gilbert.        [Jan. 9,
four pots; but in each of the four pots of blue lupins, and in
each   of the four of yellow lupins, oue or more seeds failed,
and had to be replaced ; and in some cases these also failed.
There was in fact failure, not only in the poor Flit wick sand,
but in the less poor lupin sand, and also in the rich garden soil. It
is admittedly very difficult to secure healthy growth with lupins in
pots.    On discussing the matter with Hellriegel, at the meeting of
the Naturforscher Vereammlung, at Cologne, in September, 1888, he
stated that it had required the experience of several years to insure
favourable growth of lupins under such circumstances ; and that one
essential condition seemed to be that the soil must be kept open and
porous; a result which, even with sand, was seldom attained if the
 dry materials were put into the pot, and then water poured on ; the
 better plan being to bring the sand to a proper condition of moisture
 by well mixing water with it by degrees out of the pot, and then
 putting it lightly into the pot. It is also important that the mineral
 matter added to the soil should be quite neutral.
    The failures are well illustrated by the photographs exhibited.
 Thus, in spite of the re-sowings, there were, on November 3, that is
 after three months since the first sowing of blue lupins, three plants
 in pot 1, with the yellow Flitwick sand without soil-extract ; only two
 in pot 2, with the same sand and soil-extract seeding; none in pot 3
 with the lupin sand itself, from which the soil-extract was prepared ;
 and three, but of very varying size, in pot 4, with garden soil.
    Then the photographs of the yellow lupins show that, in pot 1, with
 the yellow Flitwick sand, there remained only two plants ; in pot 2,
 with the same sand and lupin soil-extract seeding, only two ; in
 pot 3, with the lupin sand itself only two ; and in pot 4, with the
 garden soil, only two plants.
    We shall call attention to the development of the roots, and of
 nodules on them, in the case of the blue and yellow lupins, further on.
 Nitrogen determinations have also been made in most of the products ;
 but, as with both blue and yellow lupins, there was actually less
 growth with than without the lupin sand extract, assumed to supply
 the organisms, we do not propose to discuss the analytical results on
 the present occasion; but, so far as that part of the subject is con
 cerned, we shall confine attention to results relating to the peas, of
  which the growth was much more satisfactory, and the analytical
 results afford very important indications.
    As ^aU^eady said, the peas in each of the four pots germinated and
             '
 grew well. -Throughout, those in the garden soil were more luxuriant
 than those in either of the other pots. Pots 2 and 3 were each seeded
 with 23 c.c. of the garden-soil-extract on August 13, that is just a
 week after the sowing of the seed.        For some time, however, the
 pi unts in pot I, with the sand without soil-extract, showed more

growth, and better colour, than those in either pot 2 or pot 3 with the
soil-extract seeding.       Indeed, it was not until about the middle of
September, that is four or fire weeks after the seeding with soil-
extract, that the plants in pots 2 and 3 began to show a darker green
colour than those in pot 1 without the soil-extract.                 The indication
was, however, so striking, that on September 25 it was decided to
count the leaves, and to estimate the relative area of leaf-surface, on
the plants in the different pots.             For this purpose, the leaves were
classified into those which were dead, those that were dving, those
which were changing colour, and those which were still bright green.
It must suffice here to show the number, and the estimated relative
area, of the total leaves in each case, on September 25, when the first
counting and estimates were made, on October 17, on November 14,
and on December 14, when the plants were cut.                  The following table
summarises      these  results.      The   first four   columns show the total
number of leaves, and the second four the estimated relative leaf-
surface, that of the plants of pot 1 (without soil seeding) on Septem
ber 25, being taken as 100.

    It is thus seen that, on September 25, after it had been observed
 that the plants in pots 2 and 3, with the soil-extract seeding, had
 begun to show a darker green colour than these in pot 1 without the
 soil-extract, they nevertheless, up to that date, showed both a less
 number of leaves, and considerably less leaf-surface, than the plants
 in pot 1 . It is not very clear why the plants with the soil-extract seeding
should have remained so long in a comparatively backward condition.
 It may be that the result was only accidental, depending on the
 character of the seeds, or on the fact that pot 1 stood at the southern
 end of the row, and nearest the glass.            The alternative is that, in the
 early stages of development of the organisms supplied in the soil-
 extract, and of the resulting nodules, the growth of the main plant
 was, in some way, retarded.            The figures show, however, that, from

gained upon those in pot 1 without      both in number of leaves, and

   Photographs of the     pots of plants were taken on September
                              4                                     on                     1,

weeks before the taking up of the plants, and they indicate relative
progress consistently with the estimates given in the foregoing
table.
    In regard to the general character of growth should be stated that,

and to maintain their bright green colour, up to the end whilst those          ;
in pot   1  had shown more exhaustion, and maintained much less
colour.   There was, however, as was to be expected so late in the
season, no indication of flowering in any of the pots.
    It should be further stated, that the plants in all the pots com
menced rather early to show signs of mildew, which increased very
considerably, especially on the lower portions of the plauts, in tho
later stages of growth.       This was, perhaps, not to be wondered
at, considering that the greenhouse was in the midst of allotment
gardens, and that the plants were unavoidably subjected to consider
able changes as to temperature and moisture of the atmosphere.
Ventilation was, however, secured as far as practicable.
   The next point to consider is, the actual and comparative develop
ment of the roots, and of nodules on them, in the different pots, with
their different soil conditions.    As the roots had to be preserved
without any loss, for analysis, the mode of dealing with them for the
purposes of examination had to be very carefully considered, and was
necessarily more restricted than       examination had been the only
                                             if
object.    After the above-ground growth had been cut off and
removed, the pot9, with their moist soil and roots, were kept in a
warm dry place until the examination commenced.            The block of
soil was carefully turned out on to glazed cartridge paper, with as
little shaking or disturbance as possible, and notes were at once taken
as to the distribution of the roots, so far as      was then apparent.
                                                                   it
The sand or soil was then removed little by little, until the roots
were left nearly bare.    Further notes being then taken, the remaining
sand or soil was removed as far as possible by washing in a beaker

 1890.]     On the Question   of the Fixation of Free Nitrogen.         95
with a   little distilled water.  The roots were then spread out upon
paper, and so photographed, and finally noted upon.
    Enlarged photographs of the roots of the plants grown in pot 1,
with the yellow sand without soil-extract seeding, in pot 2, with the
same sand and soil-extract seeding, and in pot 4, in the garden soil,
were exhibited.
    The roots in pot 1, with the yellow sand without soil-extract seed
ing, showed a densely matted mass of fibre, those of the different
plants being considerably interwoven ; and although a few fibres
 readied the bottom of the pot, and distributed through the flints, by
far the greater portion was accumulated within the top 4 inches of
the s<and ; and, notwithstanding there was here no soil-extract seeding,
there were many nodules on the roots, but they were fewer, and
generally much smaller, than on the roots grown with soil-extract
seeding ; they were also less characteristically accumulated near the
surface, and more distributed along the root-fibres.          There were,
Lowever, some agglomerations of nodules.          Comparing this result
with that obtained in 1889, with a purer and sterilised sand,
there can be little doubt that the development of nodules, and the
comparatively luxuriant growth, in this pot without soil-extract
seeding, are to be attributed to the impurity, and non-sterilisation, of
the sand.
   The roots in pot 2, with soil-extract seeding, also showed a dense
mass of fibre, which, however, extended from the top to the bottom
of the soil, penetrated the layer of flints, and distributed over the
 bottom of the pot.       In fact, the roots were much more generally
 distributed throughout the soil, and less accumulated         within the
 surface layers, than in pot 1.    The most developed root of the three,
 had three large agglomerated nodules, each with some scores of pro
 tuberances, somewhat as on a raspberry or mulberry.            The other
 plants also showed similar nodules, but of a smaller size. There
 were also a number of small clusters distributed over the rootlets, but
 very few single nodules, differing in this respect from the character
 of development observed in pot 1.
    In pot 3, also with soil-extract seeding, each of the three plants had
 developed a mass of root-fibre extending throughout the soil from
 the top to the bottom ; though the greatest quantity was within the
 first 6 of the 7^ inches of depth.     There were large agglomerations
of nodules on the roots of each plant. There were, besides, many
small clusters, and here and there single nodules.        By far the most
of the nodules were within the top 3 inches of the sand ; but one
considerable bunch was found as low as 4 inches from the surface.
 As in the other cases, the nodules were grey, and much lighter in
 colour than the roots on which they grew.
    Each of the three plants in pot 4, with the garden soil, had a

 96              Sir J.  B. Lawes and Prof.   J. H. Gilbert.      [Jan. 9,
 stouter main root than any of those in the other pots.          From the
 side branches there proceeded a large amount of fine root-fibres,
 which extended throughout the whole soil, those from the different
 plants being much interwoven. The roots extended round the sides
 and along the bottom of the pot, much more than in either of the
 other pots.    A photograph was, therefore, taken of the block of soil
 as it came out of the pot, showing this special character of root-
 development.      There were three small clusters of nodules on the
 roots of each of the three plants, one or two smaller bunches, and
 here and there a single nodule.      But the clusters were much smaller,
 the total nnmber of nodules was much less, and they were more
 distributed throughout the soil, in this pot with rich garden soil, than
 in either of the others, even than in pot 1, without any soil-extract
  seeding.    As the description shows, the root-development was at the
  same time much greater than in either of the other pots.         To this
 point we shall have to reour again, but it may be remarked in passing,
 that the greater development          of root and root-fibre, and the
 less development of the root-nodules, in the soil which itself supplied
 abundance      of nitrogenous, as well as of other nutriment, is
 consistent with the observations of some other experimenters ; but
 it is, on the other hand, inconsistent with the observations and views
 of others.
     Finally in regard to the relative development of root-nodules under
 the diffeiont conditions, the evidence is clear, that there was a greatly
 enhanced development of them under the influence of the soil-extract
 seeding ; and that, coinoidently with this, there was a considerably
 increased growth of the above-ground parts of the plant.
     The distinctly less development of root-nodules in the rich garden
 soil, than in the sand with soil-extract seeding, as observed in the
 case of the peas, was, however, not found in that of the lupins, as
 the following notes on the roots of the lupins grown in 1888, will
show.
    In  pot 5, with   the impure yellow sand, but without soil-extract,
eventually three plants of blue lupins grew. From the short, thick,
main root, many branches proceeded, extending from the top to the
bottom     of the soil  ; those plants having the largest above-ground
development      had also the most root.    The branches were fleshy and
succulent, and thicker at a distance     from the main stem than near
it.    No nodules were observed on the roots in this pot.
    In pot 6, with lupin-soil-extract, but with only two plants, the roots
were of the same general character as to branching, extension, fleshi
ness, and succulence, as those in pot 5.        There was, however, one
nodule, about the size of a pea, on a root-fibre on one of the two
plants.
    In pot 7, with the lupin sand itself, there was no plant.

1890.]     On   the Question   of the Fixation of Free Nitrogen.       97
   In pot 8, with the garden soil, there were three plants, two of them
small ones   from more recent sowings than the other, and with mnch
less root development ; but there were three or four nodules or swel
lings on the root-fibres of each plant.      The largest and oldest plant
showed a very great development of root, extending throughout the
soil, round the sides, and along the bottom of the pot.      On the main
root, which was thick and strong down to about 5 inches, there were
two large swellings or nodules about 3 inches from the surface, each
of which, unlike the bunches of nodules on the pea roots, appeared
externally to be single and solid, but indented. There were, besides,
nineteen small swellings on the root-fibres, of the same colour as the
root itself, and whether these were nodules or not was not very
obvious.
   In pot   9, in the yellow sand without soil-extract, there were two
plants of yellow lupins.      With less above-ground growth, there was
also  considerably less root development, than under the same soil con
ditions with the blue      lupins (pot 5). As in the case of the blue
lupins, there were, however, no nodules.
   In pot 10, with lupin-soil-extract seeding, there were two small
plants, also with small root-development, but throwing out much fine
fibre near the surface, and then slender branches to the bottom of the
pot.    There were here, again, no nodules.
   In pot 11, with the lupin sand, there were two plants, one very
 much larger than the other.       There was a swelling on the thick main
root of the smaller plant, but there were no nodules on the rootlets.
 The larger and older plant developed a dense mass of both fleshy and
fine fibrous root.     The main root, about 1 inch from the surface,
 was encased by a large swelling.        The roots extended from the top
to the bottom of the soil.      No nodules were observed on the rootlets,
but there was an abundance of root-hairs.
   In pot 12, with garden soil, there were two plants. The stout,
woody, main root, extended deeper than in the other pots ; and there
were many branches, extending round the sides and along the bottom
of the pot.     The larger plant had two swellings on the main root,
about 1£ inch from the surface, each of the size of a field bean ; also
three small nodules on the root-fibres.        The smaller plant had one
indication of such a swelling on the main root, and twelve nodules on
the root-fibres, three the size of a pea, three half as large, and six
very small.      The larger were 1 or 2 inches from the surface, the
others   lower,   one 6 inches down. There was more fine fibre, but
very much less development of root-hairs than in pot 11.
    Thus, in the case of both blue and yellow lupins, there were no
nodules without soil-extract, and only one with the lupin soil-extract

more marked development, both of swellings on the main roots, and
of nodules on the root-fibres.    The very meagre development of
nodules both with lupin-soil-extract seeding, and in the lupin-soil
itself, in 1888, when, as will be seen further on, the result was so
different in 1889, suggests the question whether the lupin-sand of
1888 had been too much dried, and so sterilised.

   We will now turn to the evidence afforded by analysis, as to the
difference in the amount of growth, and especially as to the difference
in the amount of nitrogen assimilated, in the peas grown under the
different conditions.
   The following table shows the percentages of ash, and of nitrogen
determined by copper oxide (each calculated on the dry substance),
in the stems and leaves together, and in the roots, of the plants in the
different pots.

  It is remarkable how much lower is the percentage of ash in the dry
substance    of the more normally-developed plants grown in the
garden soil, than in that of those grown in the sand with plant-
ash added.      There can be no doubt that the amount of soluble
mineral matter provided in the quantity of ash used was excessive ;
and less has been supplied in the experiments of 1889. The per
centage of ash in the dry substance of the roots         however, in all        is,
cases high,  but doubtless some  adherent  sand would  be included.
   The differences in the percentage of nitrogen in the dry substance of
the differently grown plants are consistent with the known characters
of growth. Thus, the lighter colour, and the comparatively restricted
growth, of the plants in pot    indicated nitrogen exhaustion and the
                                       1,                                                  ;

    It is seen that there is more dry substance in the above-ground
 growth, but less remaining in the roots, in pots 2 and 3 with the soil-
 extract than in pot 1 without it.                    In the whole plant there is, of dry
 substance with soil-extract, about                  llf  grams in pot 2, and more than
 11 grams in pot 3, against only 10 grams in pot 1 without soil-
 extract.
    The point of chief interest is, however, that there was twice, or
 more than twice, as much nitrogen in the above-ground growth in
 pots 2 and 3 with the soil-extract seeding, as in pot                        I  without it. But
 there is much less differeuce              in the amount of nitrogen remaining in
 the roots under the different conditions.                     In the total vegetable matter
there is in pot 2 more than twice, and in pot 3 nearly twice, as much
nitrogen as in pot 1 without the soil-extract.
    With the full supply of already combined nitrogen in pot 4, with
garden soil, there was about one and a third time as much dry sub
stance produced, and more nitrogen assimilated, than under the
influence of the soil-extract seeding.
    The significance of the results relating to the nitrogen is, how
ever, more clearly brought to view in the next table, which shows—
the amounts in the soils at the commencement                           and at the conclusion
of the experiment, and the gain or loss ; the amounts in the seed, in
the total products of growth, and the gain ; the total nitrogen in the

            [The results relating to the soils in pots 1, 2, and 3, are calculated
        from the copper oxide determinations ; which gave, in the dry sand
         at the commencement (as already shown) 0-00245 per cent, nitrogen ;
        and at the conclusion the amounts were :— 0-00269 in that of pot 1,
        000239 in that of pot 2, and 000208 in that of pot 3. The deter
        minations in the garden soil were hy the soda-lime process, and were
        only made to obtain a general idea of the result, and were not
        intended for exact quantitative estimates of gain or loss. Thns, the
        higher the percentage of nitrogen, the smaller the quantity that can
        be taken for burning, whilst such a soil, rich from the application of
        dung, is a very heterogeneous mixture, and difficult to sample for
        analysis.         It, moreover, contains a very large amount of carbon, and
        gives a coloured acid for titration.                      Nor was the nitric acid deter
        mined, either at the commencement                         or at the conclusion ; but, with
        so much organic matter the error, if any, thus arising would be
        immaterial.           The determinations were, however, fairly accordant for
        such material ; giving, calculated on the dry soil, at the commence
        ment, 04341 and 0-4379, mean 0.4360 per cent. ; and at the
        conclusion, 0.4378 and 0-4342, mean 0'4360.                           It may be added, that
        a difference or error of 0'01 in the percentage of nitrogen in the soil,
        would represent a gain or loss of 0-204 gram on the quantity of the
        garden soil used. The data upon which the amounts of nitrogen in
        the seed, and in the products of growth, are calculated, have been
        already considered. — January 24, 1890.]

             The first point to notice is, that there is very little difference in the
         amount of nitrogen in the soils at the commencement, and at the
         conclusion, of the experiments.                      There would, doubtless, be some

1890.]      On tfie Question of  the Fixation of Free Nitrogen.         101
fine root-fibre not removed at the conclusion, so that where there is
loss it is to be supposed that some of the original nitrogen of the soil
has contributed to the growth.       In the case of the garden soil, with
its high percentage of nitrogen, it is of course not impossible that
there may have been some loss by evolution of free nitrogen.
    That there is at any rate no material gain in the soils would seem
to be confirmatory of the conclusion indicated by other evidence,
that the fixation of nitrogen is not effected by the organisms within
the soil independently of the symbiotic growth of the nodules and
their contents and the higher plant to which they are attached, to
whose nitrogenous supply they seem to contribute.            Indeed, if the
fixation had taken place under the influence of microbes within the
soil, independently of connexion with the higher plant, we should
have to conclude that the latter had, nevertheless, availed itself of
exactly the whole of the nitrogen so brought into combination — a
supposition for which there would seem no reasonable justification.
    Turning to the middle division of the table, which shows the nitro
 gen in the seed sown, in the total vegetable matter grown, and the
gain, and disregarding the changes in the soil itself, which it has been
 seen may well be done, it will be observed that the gain of nitrogen in
 the plants is so large as to be very far beyond the limit of any
 possible experimental error.      This certainly cannot bo said of some
 of the experiments conducted on other lines, the results of which
 have been published in recent years, and been held to show the fixa
 tion of free nitrogen under the agency of micro-organisms within the
 soil, without coincident higher plant-growth, or with the coincident
 growth of other plants than of the leguminous family.
    The gain in these initiative experiments with peas is, however,
 much less than in many of those of Hellriegel and WiUarth. This is
 not to be wondered at, when the late period of the season, and the
 consequent character of the growth, are borne in mind ; and when we
 come to consider the greater growth attained in the experiments of
 1889, little donbt can be entertained that the fixation was then very
 much greater than it was in 1888.
    To refer to the figures, it is seen that, whilst the nitrogen supplied
 in the seed was only 0'03 gram or less, that of the products of growth
 was 0-2822 gram in pot 1, 0-5361 in pot 2, 0-4357 in pot 3, and 0-6600
 in pot 4 ; and the gains are ^ of a gram in pot 1, more than ^ a gram
in pot 2, nearly    \ a gram in pot 3, and more than \ a gram in pot 4.
    The third division of the table shows — the total nitrogen at the com
mencement (in soil and seed together), at the conclusion (in soil and
total vegetable matter grown), and the gains. But the significance of
the results is more clearly seen in the last two columns.       The first of
these shows the relation of the amount of nitrogen in the total
products (soil a,nd plants together) to the total initial nitrogen (soil
                                                                 I 2

and seed together), taken as 1. It is seen that, even in pot 1, with
the impure and not sterilised sand, hut without soil-extract, there
was, so reckoned, more than three times as much nitrogen in the
products as in the soil and seed ; in pot 2, with soil-extract, there was
about five times as much ; and in pot 3, also with soil-extract, there
was more than four times as much.              In the case of pot 4, how
ever, with garden soil, owing to the large amount of initial nitrogen
in the soil, the gain, so reckoned, appears but small.
    It is in the last column of the table, in which, disregarding the nitro
gen in the soils, which remained so nearly constant throughout, and
reckoning the relation of the nitrogen in the total products of growth
to that in the seed taken as 1, that the large amount of fixation is
brought clearly to view.        So reckoned, the nitrogen in the substance
               —
grown was in pot 1, 9£ fold ; in pot 2, nearly 18 fold ; in pot 3,
nearly 15 fold; and in pot 4, nearly 22 fold, that supplied in the seed.
                      The Vegetation Experiments   in 1889.
     In this   second season a more extensive series was arranged. The
 plants selected were — peas, red clover, vetches, blue lupins, yellow
 lupins, and lucerne.       For the lupins and lucerne, specially made pots
 of glazed earthenware, about 6 inches in diameter, and 15 inches deep
 inside, that is about twice as deep as the pots used in 18?8, and as
 used again for the peas, red clover, and vetches, were employed.
 These pots had holes at the bottom for drainage, and slits at the
 side, near the bottom, for aeration.       All the pots stood in specially
 made    saucers   or pans  of the  same material.    A quantity of broken,
 washed, and this time ignited flint, was put into the bottom
 of each pot. The sand used was a rather coarse white quartz sand,
 from which the coarser and the finer portions were removed by siftinc,
 and more of the finer by washing and decantation, first with well, and
  afterwards with distilled water.       In defect of means for igniting so
 large a quantity of material (about 300 lbs.) without running the
  risk of gaining more impurity than was expelled, the portion
  retained for use was kept, in successive lots, in a large water-bath,
  at nearly 100° C., for several days, and then preserved in well-closed
  bottles.    The results will show that the sand so prepared was suffi
  ciently,  if not absolutely, sterilised.
      In each case the sand was mixed with 01 per cent, of the plant-ash,
  and 0'1 per cent, of calcium carbonate.
      There were four pots of each description of plant. Of the peas,
  clover, vetches, and lucerne, No. 1 was with the prepared quartz sand
  without soil-extract ; No. 2 with the quartz sand and garden soil
  extract added ; No. 3 was duplicate of No. 2 ; and No. 4 was with
  the garden soil itself.     Of the blue and yellow lupins. No. 1 was with

the prepared quartz sand without soil-extract ; No. 2 with lupin-soil-
extract added ; No. 3 was duplicate of No. 2 ; and No. 4 was with the
lupin soil itself, to which 001 per cent, of the plant-ash was added.
   The soil-extracts were in all cases added on July 9, before the
sowing of the seed ; 25 c.c. in the case of the peas, vetches, and clover,
and 50 c.c. in that of tho lupins and lucerne.
   The seeds, carefully selected and weighed as in 1888, were sown on
July 10, that is, about four weeks earlier than in the previous year,
but still not so early as was desirable.   In the case of the clover, ten
seeds were sown in each pot ; in that of the blue and yellow lupins
three, and in that of the peas, vetches, and lucerne, only two seeds
were put in each pot.
   In all four pots, the peas germinated and grew well from the begin
ning.     In the No. 1 pot of vetches, one seed failed and had to be
replaced. Several of the red clover seeds failed, and eventually four
plants only were left in each pot. As in 1888, most of the blue
lupins failed ; and eventually only one plant in only one of the four
pots, remained.     Some of both the yellow lupins and the lucerne also
failed; but, as will be seen further on, eventually two good plants
of each remained in each pot.
    No analytical details relating to the experiments of 1889 are yet
available ; but the notes on growth, and the photographs of the
plants and of their roots convey a clear idea of the importance and
 significance of the results obtained.
    The peas were taken up on October 23 and 24. Photographs of
 the four pots of plants were taken on August 3, August 20, Septem
ber 27, and October 22, that is the day before taking up ; and an en
largement of the last taken is exhibited.      It is seen that, unlike the
result obtained in pot 1 in 1888 with the impure and non-sterilised
sand, the plants in the purer and sterilised quartz sand, show
extremely limited growth.        Before the end of July, the plants in
both pots 2 and 3, with soil-extract, began to show enhanced growth
compared with that in pot 1, without soil-extract seeding; and
eventually, whilst the plants in pot 1 were only 8^ and 8^ inches in
height, those in pot 2 with soil-extract were 14 and 50^ inches ; and
those in pot 3, also with soil-extract, were 52£ and 50J inches high.
In pot 4, with the garden soil, the plants showed even somewhat less
extended growth than those in pots 2 and 3 with the soil-extract
only. But the plants in pot 4 were more vigorous, and whilst they
flowered and seeded, neither of those in either pot 2 or 3 did so ; but
continued to vegetate, the upper parts apparently at the expense of
the lower.
    The root development should be briefly noticed.      In pot 1, withont
soil-extract, it was altogether much less than in either pot 2 or pot 3
 with soil-extract, or than in pot 4 with garden soil. Enlarged photo

                                       and 4, clearly illustrate
further seen that, in pot     1, without soil-extract, the main roots
descended some distance before they threw out any considerable
amount of root-branches and of root-fibre ; whereas, in pots 2 and 3.
with soil-extract, there was characteristically much more fibre dis
tributed both in the upper layers and throughout the pot.
   It is specially to be noted that, whereas in pot I in 1888, with
impure and non-sterilised sand, there was a considerable develop
ment of nodules, now in the pure and sterilised sand, not a nodule
was observable.
   In pot 2, with soil-extract, one plant was very much larger than
the other, and developed very much more root.       The smaller plant
had, however, several nodules on the main root, near the surface of
the soil, and a good many small ones distributed along the fibres.
Most of the nodules were more or less shrivelled. The larger plant
had a large cluster of nodules on the main root, very near the surface ;
and a very large number of single nodules, mostly small, was distri
buted on the root-fibres, quite to the bottom of the pot. Upon the
whole those on the larger plant were less shrivelled.
   In pot 3, also with soil-extract, the main roots extended to, and
along, the bottom of the pot ; throwing off many side branches, with
a very large quantity of fine fibrous root.  The greatest distribution
was, however, in the upper few inches of the soil. There were two
clusters of nodules on one of the plants, and threo on the other,
besides smaller bunches.      A large number of mostly single small
nodules was also distributed along the roots.   On one of the plants,
the largest cluster was on the main root, and on the other the clusters
were on the side branches.
  In  pot 4, with the garden soil, there was a dense mass of root-fibre
throughout the first 6 inches of depth.         There were numerous
nodules, the majority siogle, and   within the upper 2 or 3 inches of
soil. There were also a few small bunches.
   Thus, then, the limited growth in pot 1, without soil-extract, is
coincident with the entire absence of nodule-formation ; and the in
creased growth in pots 2 and 3, with soil-extract, is coincident with a
very great development of nodules.       In pot 4, with garden soil,
itself supplying abundance of nitrogen, there was also a considerable
development of nodules, but distinctly less than in pots 2 and 3, with
soil extract only.
   The vetches were taken up on October 26. They had been photo
graphed on August 3, August 20, September 27, and lastly on
October 25, that is, the day before taking up ; and of this last repre
sentation an enlargement was exhibited.
   Here, as with the peas, the plants in pots 2 and 3, with soil-
extract, had shown more growth than those in pot I without         it,
                                                                 before

the end of July. Again, as with the peas, the vetches in the pure
and sterilised sand showed extremely limited growth. On the other
hand, those in pots 2 and 3, with the soil-extract grew, as shown in
the photograph, to a very great height ; indeed, higher than those in
pot 4 with the garden soil.
   The heights of the plants were — in pot 1, without soil-extract,
11^ and \0\ inches; in pot 2, with soil-extract, 52^ and 67 inches;
in pot 3, also with soil-extract, 61^ and 51 inches ; and in pot 4, with
garden soil, only 53 and 36 inches.
   But, as in the case of the peas, whilst the plants in pot 4 with the
garden soil flowered and seeded, those in pots 2 and 3, with the soil-
extract only, did not, but continued to extend upwards at the expense
of the lower parts of the plant.
   There was much less development of root in pot 1, without soil-
extract, than in either pots 2 or 3 with it, or than in pot 4 with the
garden soil. The main roots descended to the bottom of the pot, and
threw out a number of side branches, but there was a marked defi
ciency of root-fibre. Not a single nodule was found.
   In pot 2, with soil-extract, there was, as shown in a photograph,
a dense mass of root and root-fibre, which distributed throughout the
whole of the soil, chough the greatest accumulation was within the
first 3 inches of depth. There were numerous nodules, but consider
ably less in quantity than on the corresponding pea-plants. They
were mostly single, the greater number being found in the lower
layers, which is also contrary to the result with the peas. They were,
moreover, generally exceedingly small.
   In pot 3, also with soil-extract, there was also an immense develop
ment of root and root-fibre through the whole area of the soil ; the
greatest accumulation being in the upper and lower portions of the
pot, with less in the middle. There were many nodules, but very
small, and probably fewer than on the roots in pot 2.           All the
nodules were single, and fairly distributed over the whole root area.
    In pot 4, with garden soil, there was a moderate amount of root
and of root-fibre, chiefly within the upper 6 inches of depth ; but
there was altogether very much less of root development than in
either pots 2 or 3 with the soil-extract.     There were many nodules,
but all single, and very small ; and they appeared to be flattened, as
if exhausted of their contents.
    Here again, then, as with the peas, the very restricted growth in
pot 1, without soil-extract seeding, was associated with very limited
root development, and with the entire absence of nodule-formation.
On the other hand, the very greatly extended vegetative growth in pots
2 and 3, with soil-extract, was associated with an immense develop
 ment of root and root-fibre, extending throughout the pots, and with
 the formation of numerous nodules; which, however, were generally

  106            Sir J. B. Lawes and Prof.    J.  H. Gilbert.       [Jan.  9,
  smaller, more distributed over the whole root area, and less accumu
  lated near the surface, than in the case of the peas. Lastly, in the
  garden soil, with its liberal supply of combined nitrogen, there was
  much less development of roots, and less also of nodules, than in the
  pots with soil-extract only.
                           Received January 21.
     It has already been said that most of the blue lupins failed      ; but
 it was with the yellow lupins that the most striking results wero
 obtained.
    As in the   case of the other plants, the yellow lupin seeds were put
 in on July 10, three being sown in each pot. There were some re-
 sowings, some seeds taken out, and, eventually, two plants were left
 in each pot. By the end of July those in pots 2 and 3, with the lupin-
 soil-extract seeding, already showed more growth than those in pot 1
 without it. Photographs were taken on August 3, August 20, Sep
 tember 27, October 28, and November 29 ; and the plants were cut on
 December 7. An enlargement of the photograph taken on October 28
 was exhibited ; and the later representation, that of November 29,
 was thrown on the screen.
    It is seen that the plants in pot 1, without soil-extract seeding,
scarcely appeared over the rim of the pot, one being only about l^,
and the other about 2^ inches high.       In pot 2, with lupin-soil-extract
seeding,   one  plant was about 2 feet, and the other more than 1£ foot
high ; both spreading much beyond the width of the pot. In pot 3,
also with lupin-soil-extract seeding, one plant was more than 2 feet,
but the other little more than 8 inches high. In fact, in both these
pots with soil-extract seeding only, the plants showed considerably
more development than those in pot 4 in the lupin-soil itself ; one of
these being only about 16, and the other about 18 inches high, and
 both less branching than those in pots 2 and 3.
    Unlike the peas and vetches, the yellow lupins with soil-extract
seeding flowered and podded freely.         One plant in pot 2 had nine
small pods ; and one in pot 3, four large and three small ones. There
were also in pot 4, with lupin-soil, on one plant five pods, and on the
other six.
    Thus, in the quartz-sand with lupin-soil-extract seeding, the plants
not only produced a great deal more vegetable matter than those in
the lupin- sand itself, but they as freely flowered and seeded.
    Photographs of the roots of the plants in each of the four pots
were taken ; and enlargements of those in pot 1 without soil-extract
seeding, in pot 3 with soil-extract seeding, and in pot 4 with the lupin-
soil itself, were exhibited.

 1890.]    On  the Question   of the  Fixation of Free Nitrogen.     107
    In pot  1, without  soil-extract, and very restricted above-ground
 growth, there was coincidently very little root development.        The
 main roots descended far «n. wn the deep pot almost without branching,
but at the bottom a number of branches, and a mass of fibre were
 produced.     The root-fibres were fleshy and succulent.        No root
 swellings or nodules were found.
    In pot 2, with the lupin-soil-extract seeding, there was, on the
 other hand, a very great development of root. Branches were thrown
out throughout the whole length ; and at their ends masses of fleshy
fibrils were formed, which were thickly coated with root-hairs. On
the main root of one plant, 3 inches down, there was a largo swelling
or nodule the size of a field bean ; 4 inches lower there were three
smaller ones on a side branch ; 10 inches down there were three as
large rs peas ; and lower still there was another small swelling, more
like the nodules found on other plants. The other plant had less root
growth.     One and a half inch down there was a swelling the size of a
small pea ; and 4^ inches lower there were three swellings, one as
large as a bean, and the others about the size of a vetch seed.    These
dwellings on the lupin-roots, which were all on the main roots or
thicker branches, are very different in appearance from the nodules
on the pea and vetch-roots. They are, as described, swellings, en
casing the root where they grow.
    In pot 3, also with the soil-extract seeding, one plant, as an
enlarged photograph shows,          developed  an immense     amount of
branching root, with a great deal of root-fibre, which extended
throughout the whole soil, but to a greater degree in the lower than
in the upper half of the pot. The main root was woody near the
top. The lower root-fibres were fleshy, and thickly coated with root-
hairs. There were several swellings or nodules on the main root
below b inches ; and lower down, on a root-branch, there were several
swellings; there being in all twelve on this plant. On the smaller
and more meagrely rooted plant, about 10 inches down, there were
also two bunches of small nodules, and three single nodules ; and a
little lower, on a side branch, another small nodule. With regard to
the great development of root-hairs on the fine fibrils of the roots in
both pots 2 and 3, with quartz sand and soil-extract seeding, it may
be supposed that this was an effort to acquire mineral nutriment,
in quantity commensurate with the large amount of nitrogen fixed,
and available to the plant.
   In pot 4, with the lupin-sand, the distribution of root was very
different from that in pots 2 and 3, with the soil-extract.    The main
root, at a depth of 2 inches, threw out many thread-like branches, at
the end of each of which there was a bundle of fine fibre.           The
lower fibres became thicker, and were white and fleshy ; but they
 were without the marked development of root-hairs observed in such

    108             Sir   J.   B. Lawes and Prof.   J.   H. Gilbert.    [Jan.   9,
    abundance   in pots 2 and 3. Most of the root was within 6 inches of
    the surface, and there seemed to be none below 14 inches.    One to
    two inches from the surface, there were swellings on the main roots
    which were less raised, but more spreading, than those on the roots in
    pots 2 and 3.   There were also, on one side branch, six. very small
    nodules.
      To sum up in regard to the yellow lupins          Under the influence of
                                                         :
    the soil-extract seeding, the above-ground growth was Dot only very
    luxuriant, but the plants developed great maturing tendency, flower
    ing and seeding freely.        The development of the roots generally,
    and that of swellings or nodules on them, were also very marked ;
    and there can be no doubt that the gain of nitrogen will be found to
    be very large.       In pot 4, with the lupin-sand itself, which would
    supply a not immaterial amount of combined nitrogen, although the
    growth was normal, it was, both above ground and within the soil,
    very much less than in the pots with soil-extract only ; and the de
    velopment of nodules was also less. It is possible that the less
    development      in the lupin-sand itself, than in the quartz-sand with
    soil-extract only, was partly due to the much less porosity of the lupin-
     soil, especially when watered. At any rate, the results with the soil-
     extract only are very remarkable.
         As the main growth of red clover is in the second year, and that of
     lucerne also in years subsequent to the first, the pots of these plants
     are left for further growth; so that there         at present, but little of
                                                         is,
     definite result available in regard to them.     There are, however, some
     points of special interest to notice.
         A photograph of the clover plants taken on September 28 was
     thrown on the screen.        The above-ground growth in pot        without
                                                                       1,
     soil-extract, was distinctly more than in either pots         or with
                                                                   2   3        it
                                                                                 ;
     and  it    judged that the amount of growth will probably prove to be
               is
      greater  than   is to be accounted for by the amount of nitrogen sup
      plied in the seed sown.       As the soil-extract seeding in pots    and
                                                                            2    3
      seemed to be without effect, a second    amount  of extract, but this  time
      from garden soil where clover was growing well, was, on September          4,
.
      applied to pot  2   ;but to pot there was added instead a solution of
                                       3
      calcium nitrate, and this application was continued up to December         6,
      when, in all, 023 gram of nitrogen had been so applied.         The effect
      of the nitrate was, undoubtedly, some increased growth, but especially
      an increased depth of green colour. It remains to be seen what will
    be the final result.
      The application of garden-soil-extract to lucerne also appeared to
    be entirely without effect up to the beginning of September; the
    plants in pot without soil-extract, and those in pots
                     1                                        and  2with it.

    showing no difference, and apparently  no  progress.   On  September         4,
    therefore, pot   was re-seeded with soil-extract, this time from a soil

 1800.]     On the Question    of  the Fixation of Free Nitrogen.       109
 growing lucerne ; and, at the same time, a solution of calcium nitrate
 was added to pot 3, and the application was continued, as in the case
of the clover. For many weeks the repeated soil-extract seeding was
without any apparent effect ; but, quite recently, there has been a
slightly increased depth of colour, and perhaps a little growth. The
application of nitrate to pot 3, however, showed marked effect very
soon after the application had been commenced ; and, as the repre
 sentation of the growth on December 23 shows, there was up to
 that time, considerable growth under the influence of the nitrate.
    The darkening of the colour of the leaves of the clover, and the
increased growth of the lucerne, under the influence of the nitrate, in
soil otherwise nitrogen-free, is of interest.        Not that there is any
want of abundant evidence showing that Leguminosse do take up
nitrogen largely as nitrate, but, in view of the new results under the
influence of micro-organism seeding, it seems to be assumed by some
 that these plants probably depend for their nitrogen exclusively on
 such agency.
    Before concluding in      regard to the experimental plants, some
 reference should be made     to the very great difference in the external
 appearance and character     of the swellings, or nodules, on the roots of
 the different descriptions    of plant, and even on those of the same-
 description.    In the  course   of the examinations this was so marked,
 that it was contemplated to take photographs illustrating the most
 characteristic differences ; and, as it was found that the roots of the
 experimental plants, which had to be preserved for analysis, could
 not without risk be manipulated as required for the purpose, some
 plants were procured from the garden and the fields, and notes of
 previous observations were looked up. Presumably owing to the late
 period of the season, the roots so obtained were, however, not suitable
for the illustration desired.      It must suffice, therefore, avoiding any
attempt   at  technical description, to make a few general observations
on the facts at command ; and to say that wc hope to follow the
subject up at a more suitable season of the year, and then to be able
to give some acconnt, not only of the general external, but, if possi
ble, of the internal characters of the different bodies.
    It should be stated that, so far as the nodules on the roots of the
bean are concerned, a full technical description, both of their external
characters and internal structure, has been given by Professor
Marshall Ward (' Phil. Trans.,' B, 1887, vol. 178, p. 539, et seq.).
    Reference to the descriptions which we have already given will
show, that the external appearance, and distribution, of the nodules
was very different on the roots of the peas, the vetches, and the
lupins.    In the case of the peas there were many of what may be
called agglomerations of nodules, and comparatively few single ones
distributed on the root-fibres.        On the roots of the vetches, there

  110            Sir  J. B. Lawes and Prof.       J. H. Gilbert.       [Jan. 9,
  were comparatively few agglomerations or bunches, and more single
  nodules, pretty widely distributed along the root-fibres.          The lupin
  roots,  on   the   other hand, showed tubercular developments            very
  different from those on either the pea or the vetch roots.         Indeed, at
  the period of examination, that is when the plants were nearly ripe,
  two apparently distinct kinds were observed ; one of which, the most
  prevalent, we have spoken of as
                                             " swellings," and the other as
  "nodules." The " swellings" were chiefly on the main roots or the
  thicker branches ; where they grew they encased the root entirely,
  and they had a shining and presumably impervious skin.                   The
  " nodules," on the other hand, were chiefly single, small, and dis
  tributed on the root-fibres. Assuming that the so-called " swellings "
  were the bodies which, with their contents, had exercised the func
                            "
  tions of the " nodules found on the roots of the other plants, it is to
  be concluded that, after the very luxuriant growth, and the flowering
  and seeding, their function was so far at an end, and they had
  become subcrised. The other bodies on the lupin roots, distinguished
  in the description as "nodules," indicated too meagre development to
  have had much share in the great amount of assimilation that had
  been accomplished.       On the other hand, the " swellings," as has been
  said, were all on the main roots or thicker branches ; whilst it is
  generally stated that the nodules are only formed on the young and
  still growing roots. If these " swellings," which were certainly very
  characteristic of the roots of the plants which attained the greatest
  growth, were really the effective nodules, it must be supposed that
  they had been formed where they were found, whilst the root was
  still young, and had grown with its growth.          In favour of this suppo
  sition is the fact that the increased growth from the soil-extract
  seeding commenced quite early in the life of the plants.
     In 1887, the nodule development on lucerne roots was observed at
  different periods of the season, and again quite recently, on plants
  taken from the field for that purpose.         The nodules on the roots of
  lucerne are quite different in general external character from those
'
  on any of the other plants that have been examined at Rothamsted.
  Instead of being more or less rounded, they have more the appear
  ance of shoots or buds, much longer than broad, sometimes single,
  but more often divided, or branched ; there being generally two or
  three, and sometimes as many as twenty, or even many more, in a
  bunch, joined at the base. They have not been observed on the main
  root, but only on the root-fibres, and less near the surface than within
  the range of the clay subsoil.         In some cases such a tuft or bunch
  will be at   the  end  of   a fine fibre by which it is connected with the
  main root.     As the season advances' these bodies become shrivelled,
  and are   in  fact  empty shells.      The question arises, whether in the
  case of the development in soil or subsoil containing organic nitrogen,

the lower organisms may not serve the higher, in part at least, by
taking up, either directly or indirectly, combined nitrogen ; as, for
example, fungi take up organic nitrogen from the soil ; or as, it may
be assumed, does the fungus in the case           of the fungus-mantle
observed    by Frank on the roots of Cupnliferae,        and some other
plants ?
    Among the Leguminosae growing in the mixed herbage of grass
land, in 1868, nodules were observed on the root-fibres — of Lathyrus
praienris, especially near the surface of the soil ; on the ultimate
root-fibres of Trifolium pratense, and on the smaller rootlets of
Trifulium repens.
    In the case of red clover growing in rotation on arable laud, an
abundance of nodules has been found, both near the surface and at a
considerable depth. They are generally more or less globular or oval.
                                               "           " than
Some found on the main roots are more like swellings              attached
tubercles, not, however, encasing the root, but only on one side. The
greater number are, however, small, and distributed chiefly on the
root-fibres. Observations are, however, needed, as to any difference
in character, or relative prevalence, at different periods in the life and
growth of the plant, and under different conditions of soil, both so far
as mechanical state and porosity, and richness or otherwise in avail
able supplies of combined nitrogen, are concerned.        To these points
we hope to pay    some  attention.
    Referring to the main object of the investigation, it will be
 admitted that the results so far brought forward are abundantly
 confirmatory of those obtained by Hellriegel, and that the fact of the
 fixation of free nitrogen in the growth of Legnminosae, under the
 influence of microbe seeding of the soil, and of the resulting nodule
 formation on the roots, may be considered as fully established.
    It appears that, almost concurrently with the experiments made
at Rothamsted, M. Breal, of the Physiological Laboratory of the
 Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, of Paris, has made various experiments
 on lines suggested by the results obtained by Hellriegel and Wilfarth.
 He examined the contents of nodules from lucerne roois, and
 observed rounded grains and bacteria-like filaments.      He determined
the nitrogen in the root-tubercles from various Papilionaceae, and
 found it much higher in them than in the stalks, leaves, or roots.
 He germinated peas in a nutritive solution, and added some of the
 matter from a crushed lucerne root-tubercle.       The pea roots became
 covered with tubercles, and eventually the nitrogen in the plant was
 about double that in the seed sown.          In another experiment he
 germinated two lupin seeds, inoculated one of them from a living
 lucerne root-tubercle, and planted both in gravel with a nutritive
 solution free from nitrogen.      Eventually the roots of the inoculated
  plant were covered with tubercles, whilst those of the other had

112           Sir J. B. Lawes and Prof.       J.   H. Gilbert.     [Jan. 9,
none.      The inoculated plant also contained about two and a half
times as much nitrogen as the seed, whilst without inoculation there
was practically no gain.          This experiment has been repeated by
Hellriegel with very striking results, as one of us had the oppor
tunity of seeing in August last.        In another experiment, peas were
germinated in a lucerne soil, transplanted into gravel, and nutritive
solution free from nitrogen added, when the roots became covered
with tubercles, and the nitrogen assimilated was nearly twenty-five
fold that of the seed.          On inoculating the germinated roots of
haricots, and planting them in sand, they grew vigorously, formed
pods, developed many tubercles on their roots, and assimilated nearly
fifteen times as much nitrogen as the seed supplied.              Lastly, he
planted a fragment      of lucerne root with nodules on   it,in a sandy soil,
reserving a similar fragment for analysis.             Several cuttings of
 lucerne were obtained; and when taken up the root had many
nodules, and the nitrogen assimilated was more than eighty times as
much as in the root planted.
    As to the importance to agriculture, in        a  quantitative sense, of
this newly established source of nitrogen to the Leguminosse, the
evidence at present at command       is  insufficient to enable us to form
any very decided opinion. Both agricultural investigation and direct
vegetation experiment have clearly shown that Leguminosse do take
up much soil-nitrogen, and, at any rate in great part, as nitrate. Bu.t
in our recent paper in the Philosophical Transactions before referred
                           '                                  '
to, we showed that, in some special cases, there was no evidence to
justify the conclusion that the whole of the nitrogen had been so de
rived and
        ;   it  was admitted that some other explanation of the large
amounts of nitrogen assimilated was needed.           It is not improbable
that, in those cases, the agency now under consideration contributed
to the result.
    Then, as to the growth of leguminous crops in the ordinary course
of agriculture.     Hellriegel agrees with us that they do utilise soil-
nitrogen,   and  he  thinks probably always first but that that source
                                                   ;
is   supplemented    by nitrogen brought into combination under the
influence of the symbiotic growth of special organisms and the higher
plant and he supposes that the proportion of the total nitrogen assi
      ;
milated which will be due to this latter source will be greater in crops
grown in soils that are poor than in those which are rich in nitrogen.
He considers  it   probable, however, that even in the case of rich soils
there will be always more or less gain due to such fixation. The pro
portion of the nitrogen assimilated which will be gain depends, there
fore, on complicated conditions.      As bearing upon this subject  it   may
be stated that, in experiments with beans, Professor Vines found
that the formation of tubercles on the roots was very much reduced,
if  not indeed only accidental, when the plant was liberally supplied

1890.]      On  the Question  of  the Fixation of Free Nitrogen.       113
with nitrate.     Again, certainly the evidence of the experiments which
have heen described, so far as it goes, seems to indicate a less develop
ment of nodules when the soil contained an abundance of combined
nitrogen.     If this indication should be confirmed, and the inference
be generally applicable, it would be concluded that the agency of the
symbiotic growth supposed, in fixing free nitrogen, will, other things
being equal, be the less the more the soil itself is in a condition to
supply an abundance of combined nitrogen ; whilst its capability in
this respect will depend not only on the richness in combined nitrogen
of the soil within the range of the roots, but on its state of combina
tion, and on the character of the soil as to porosity and aeration.     On
the other    hand,   the  development    of  the supposed nitrogen-fixing
organisms obviously depends on the infection of the soil with the
organism essential to symbiotic life with the particular leguminous
crop to be grown. It would also seem that it is, at any rate in some
cases, dependent on the due porosity and aeration of the soil.
    Should these assumptions be borne out by the results of fnture in
 vestigation, we may conclude that the proportions in which any par
 ticular leguminous crop will derive its nitrogen from soil-supplies of
 combined nitrogen on the one hand, and from fixation under the
 influence of the symbiotic growth on the other, will be very different,
 according to the characters of the soil, as to available supply of com
 bined nitrogen, mechanical condition, and due infection. We should
 further conclude that, in such cases as those in which poor sandy
 soils will not grow fair crops of cereals, but will nevertheless yield
 enormous crops of some leguminous plant — lupins, for example — the
 leguminous crop will depend for a large proportion of its nitrogen on
 fixation, under the influence of the symbiotic growth. Again, in such
 cases as those of the growth of lucerne for many years in succession,
 as in some Continental countries, it may be supposed that such fixa
 tion would be the source of a considerable proportion of the very large
 amounts of nitrogen assimilated over a given area under such condi
 tions.
     In the case of beans, there is evidence that there is nodule-formation
  when the plant is grown under ordinary conditions, in the garden or
 in the field ; it has also been seen that nodules were formed on the
 roots of the peas and the vetches experimentally grown in garden-
 soil ; and the inference so far is, that wherever there is such formation,
 there is more or less fixation.
     Then, as to the important case of the growth of red clover in our
 rotations.    There can be no doubt that red clover does avail itself of
  soil supplies of combined nitrogen. On the other hand, the so-called
  leguminous nodules have frequently been observed on the roots of red
  clover growing in the field. Further, although Hellriegel in his
  earlier experiments did not get definite results with clover, he has

114              Sir   J.   B. Lawes and Prof.     J.    H. Gilbert.    [Jan. 9,
subsequently     obtained    increased growth by seeding with extract from
both a loamy       humus-soil, and a root-crop-soil ; but the result was less
marked than        with some other Leguminosse.       It has been seen that, in
the first year    of the experimental growth of clover at Rothamsted, no
 beneficial effect resulted from seeding with rich garden-soil-extract.
 It is believed, however, that the growth in the sterilised sand without
 soil-extract seeding will prove to be greater than can be accounted for
 by the supply of nitrogen in the seed sown.            If this should turn out
 to be the case, the supposition will be that the necessary infection has
 come from the atmosphere.          In reference to this point it may be men
 tioned that the glass-house in which the experiments are conducted
 stands in the midst of allotment gardens, in which a great variety of
 vegetables is growing, whilst Hellriegel's most definite result with
 clover was obtained by seeding with an extract from a root-crop
 soil.
     Existing evidence is, therefore, in favour of the supposition that
 red clover does derive some of its nitrogen from fixation under the
 influence of proper soil-infection, and the resulting symbiosis of the
 lower and the higher growth. There                is,
                                                     however, at present very
 little definite evidence to guide us in judging under what conditions,
 on the one hand soil supplies of combined nitrogen, and, on the
other such fixation, will contribute more or less of the total nitrogen
of the crop. As one important element in forming a judgment on the
subject, it    is, as already said, our intention to study the conditions
under which the development of nodules on the roots of growing
clover is   more or less favoured.
    Upon the whole, then, the evidence at command points to the con-
elusion that, in the case of most         if not all of our leguminous crops,
a greater or less proportion of their nitrogen will be due to the
fixation supposed.
    Admitting the fact of such fixation to be fully established, the
question still remains, how         is   itto be explained    ?  Unfortunately,
here again, as in the matter of the importance to agriculture in a
quantitative sense, of this source of nitrogen to our crops, there is
much yet to learn before        a  satisfactory answer can be given. Hell-
riegel frankly admits that a satisfactory explanation              isstill want
ing and we agree
   ;                     with  him   that we   must  know  more   of the nature
and mode of life of the organisms which, in symbiosis with the
leguminous plant, bring about the fixation of free nitrogen, before
the nature of the action can be understood. As to the mode of life
of these bodies, we owe much to the investigations of Marshall Ward,
Praimowski, Beyerinck, and others but probably none will more
                                               ;
readily admit than themselves, that the facts which they have estab
lished so far, are insufficient to afford an adequate explanation of
the phenomena involved.

 1890.]     On  the Question  of the  Fixation of Free Nitrogen.       115
    It is, it seems to as, a point of importance that it should be
established, as it appears clearly to be, that in the development of the
parasite the cortex of the host is penetrated, and so an intimate con
nexion between the two, indeed a symbiosis, is set up. Then there
is abundant evidence, that the nodules are very rich in nitrogen. So
far as the facts at command go, it would seem that their dry sub
stance may contain a higher percentage of nitrogen than that of any
other part of the still growing plant ; and, in some cases at any rate,
even higher than in that of the highly nitrogenous leguminous seed
itself.
    Whence comes this nitrogen ? The opinions of those who have
specially studied the histology and biology of the subject, do not seem
to be very clear or definite in reference to this point. According
to Prazmowski, as quoted by Marshall Ward, the bacteroids " can
only multiply in the still living protoplasm." Again, under the
influence of the fungus — " the young tubercle is developed in the
deeper parts of the cortex, and in its tissues the bacterium-like con
tents of the fungus become distributed, and grow, divide, and branch
at the expense of the protoplasmic contents.          He regarded the phe
nomenon as one of symbiosis, and as benefiting the host as well as
 the parasite." And again — " The tubercle-bacteria penetrate through
 young (not suberised) cell membranes into the root-hairs and epi
 dermis cells of the root, and there multiply at the expense of the
 protoplasmic cell-contents."
    Further, " The contents of the bacteroid cells are resorbed as the
 bacteroids dissolve, certain substances being left behind. In other
 words, the plant utilises the substance of the bacteria.           When
emptying begins,    and  with what   energy  it proceeds, depend especially
on the quantity of nitrogenous compounds at the disposal of the roots.
 In a soil rich in nitrogen the tubercles go on developing unhindered,
become large and typical, and rosy inside, and are not exhausted till
 late ; in poorer soils they attain no great size, are soon emptied, and
 are green-grey inside."
    Summarising the results and conclusions of Prazmowski, Marshall
Ward says —
    " No decision is arrived at as to whether the nitrogen is got from
nitrogen compounds or from the free nitrogen of the air, nor as to
what advantage accrues to the bacteria and the host-plant respec
tively." And again : —
    " From the preceding, we see that the tubercles depend, on a
symbiosis which is advantageous to both the plant and the bacteria.
The latter feed on the sap and cell-contents, and multiply through
innumerable generations, and, both during the life of the host and
afterwards, become redistributed in the soil.           The plant derives
advantage in that it obtains nitrogen by means of the bacteria.

116             Sir J. B. Lawes and Prof.     J. H. Gilbert       [Jan.  9,
Though the symbiosis is useful to both, the plant gains most, for
it is the more powerful, and sooner or later overcomes the bacteria,
to the multiplication of which it sets limits and finally absorbs the
substance of the latter.      Being the stronger, the plant directs the
symbiosis."
    If we understand the foregoing statements rightly, it is assumed
that the bacteria acquire their nutriment, including their nitrogen,
from the protoplasmic cell-contents of the higher plant ; and that, on
the other hand, the contents of the baoteroid cells are resorbed.      "Tn
other words, the plant utilises the substance of the bacteria." But it
is obvious that, so far as the nitrogen of the bacteria is derived from
the plant itself, the latter is not a gainer in a quantitative sense.
    It is further assumed, that the activity of the process depends — " on
the quantity of nitrogenous compounds at the disposal of the roots!
                                ....
In a soil rich in nitrogen the tubercles go on developing nnhindered,
become large and typical,                   in poorer soils they attain no
great size, &c." Here, then, combined nitrogen in the soil is sup
posed to be the source of the nitrogen of the bacteria, and that they
develop the more, the greater the supply of it. Undoubtedly, however,
the nodules may develop very plentifully in a nitrogen-free soil, and
there may be great gain of nitrogen, if only the soil be suitably
infected. Indeed, the tendency of the evidence so far at command
seems to show, that both the development of the nodules, and the gain
of nitrogen, may be the greater in the poorer, but properly infected
soil. Further, so far as the combined nitrogen of the soil is the
source of the nitrogen there is no gain of it.
   Marshall Ward says, however, that no decision is arrived at as to
whether the nitrogen is got from nitrogen compounds or from the
free nitrogen of the air, nor as to what advantage accrues to the
bacteria and the host-plant respectively.         But he adds that the
symbiosis is advantageous to both the plant and the bacteria ; the
latter feeding on the sap and the cell-contents, whilst the plant obtains
nitrogen by means of the bacteria.
   It is obvious, however, that if the nitrogen of the bacteria is
derived from the plant itself, it will be quantitatively no gainer by
resorbing it. Nor would there be any such actual gain of nitrogen
as there undoubtedly is, if the source of the nitrogen, either of the
parasite or of the host, were essentially the supplies of combined
nitrogen within the soil.
    The most probable alternatives seem to be — 1. That, somehow or
other, the plant itself is enabled, under the conditions of the symbiotic
life, to fix the free nitrogen of the atmosphere by its leaves ; a sup
position in favour of which there seems no evidence whatever. 2. That
the parasite utilises and fixes the free nitrogen, and that the nitroge
nous compounds formed are taken up by the host. On such a supposi

1890.]      On   the Question of   the  Fixation of Free Nitrogen.       117
tion, the actually ascertained    large gain of nitrogen by the leguminous
plant growing in a nitrogen-free, but properly infected, soil becomes
intelligible.    It is admitted, however, that further investigation of
the mode of life of the parasite, especially having regard to its sur
rounding media, is needed.
   It seems to us that there is nothing in the evidence pointing to the
conclusion that the fixation is effected by the lower organisms within
the soil independently of the symbiotic life.          We do not here enter
into the question,    so much discussed of late, as to whether or not there
is fixation within the soil under the influence of other low organisms,
independently of the associated growth of a higher plant.
   In our recent paper in the ' Philosophical Transactions,.' before
referred to, we said that whilst experience, whether practical or
experimental, did not point to an unsolved problem in the matter of
the sources of the nitrogen of the agricultural plants of other families,
it was far otherwise so far as those of the Papilionaceae were con«
cerned. Further, that since the question of the sources of the nitrogen
of the Leguminosae had been the subject of experiment and of con
troversy for about half a century, and it was admitted that all the
evidence that had been acquired on lines of inquiry previously fol
lowed had failed to solve the problem conclusively, it should not
excite surprise that new light should come from a new line of
inquiry ; and, that hence should be recognised the importance of the
cumulative evidence of the last few years, of which that furnished by
 the experiments of Hellriegel and Wilfarth was certainly the most
 definite and the most striking, pointing to the conclusion that although
 chlorophyllous plants might not directly utilise the free nitrogen of
 the air, some of them, at any rate, may acquire nitrogen brought into
 combination under the influence of lower organisms, the development
of which was, apparently, in some cases a coincident of the growth
of the higher plant whose nutrition they were to serve.              It was
 added, that as such a conclusion was of fundamental and far-
reaching importance, it was desirable it should be confirmed by in
dependent     investigation.
   The results even so far obtained, and recorded in this paper, can
leave no doubt that this important conclusion is confirmed, so far
as a number of agricultural        plants of the leguminous family are
concerned.       The question suggests itself, whether such, or allied
acrency, comes into play in the nitrogen assimilation of leguminous
plants generally, or of that of other than the agricultural representa
tives of the non-leguminous families to which we owe such plants,
or of those of the numerous and varied other families of the vegetable
kingdom.
   It is true that     the families which     contribute staple agricultural
plants are but few, and that the       agricultural representatives of those
                                                                  k 2

 families are also comparatively few. The families so contributing
 are, however, among the most important and widely distributed in
 the vegetable kingdom ; as also are some of the plants they con
 tribute. As prominent examples may be mentioned, the Graminece,
 affording the cereal grains, a large proportion of the mixed herbage
 of grass-land, and other products ; also the Leguminosm, yielding
 pulse crops, many useful herbage plants, and numerous other pro
 ducts.     As we have said, there does not seem to be an unsolved
 problem as to the sources of the nitrogen of other of our agricultural
 plants than those of the leguminous family.         Obviously, however, it
 would be unsafe to generalise in regard to individual families as a
 whole, from results relating to a limited number of examples sup
  plied by their agricultural       representatives  alone.  Still, there is
 nothing in the evidence at present at command, to point to the
 supposition that there is any fundamental difference in the source
 of the nitrogen of different members of the same family, such as is
 clearly indicated between the representatives of the leguminous, and
 of the other families, supplying staple agricultural products. On the
 other hand, existing evidence does not afford any means of judging
  whether or not similar, or allied agencies to those now under con
 sideration, or even quite different ones, may come into play in the
 nitrogen assimilation of the members of other families which con
  tribute such a vast variety of vegetation to the earth's surface.
     We have pleasure in stating that the conduct of the investigation
 has largely devolved upon Dr. N. H. J. Miller.         He has been almost
 wholly responsible for the analytical work, as well as for the photo
 graphing, by which a permanent record, not only of the above-
 ground growth, but of the root-development of . the experimental
 plants has been secured.        It should be added, that Mr. J. J. Willis
 has materially assisted    in the observation and noting on growth; also
 in the separation of the roots, mounting them for observation and
 for photographing, and in noting upon them.
 II.    " On Electric Discharge between Electrodes at different
        Temperatures in Air and in High Vacua,"                   By J. A.
        Fleming, M.A., D.Sc., Professor of Electrical Engineering
        in University College, London.            Communicated by Pro
        fessor G. C. Foster, F.R.S.        Received December 16, 1889.
                             (Preliminary Notice.)
     It has been known for some time that if a platinum plate or wire
is sealed     through the glass bulb of an ordinary carbon filament
incandescent     lamp, this metallic plate being quite out of contact  with

 1890.]          between    Electrodes at different Temperatures.                  lift
the carbon conductor, a sensitive galvanometer connected between
this insulated metal plate enclosed in the vacuum and the external
positive electrode of the lamp indicates a current of some milli-
amperes passing through it when the lamp is set in action, but the
same instrument when connected between the negative electrode of
the lamp and the insulated metal plate indicates no sensible current.
 This phenomenon in carbon incandescence lamps was first observed by
 Mr. Edison, in 1884, and further examined by Mr. W. H. Preece, in
 1885.*     The primary object of the experiments described in this
paper was the further examination of this effect, but the inquiry
has extended itself beyond this range and embraced some general
phenomena of electric discharge between electrodes at unequal tem
peratures, and in particular has revealed some curious effects in the
behaviour of an electric arc taken between carbon poles towards a
third insulated carbon on metal poles.
    The first series of experiments had reference to the nature of the
 effect observed in the incandescence lamps having an insulated wire
 or plate placed in the vacuum.
    If a platinum wire is sealed through the glass bulb of an ordinary
 carbon filament lamp and carries at its extremity a metal plate, so
 placed as to stand up between the legs of the carbon horseshoe with
 out touching either of them, then when the lamp is actuated by a
 continuous current it is found that : —
    (1.) This insulated metal plate is brought down instantly to
 the potential of the base of the negative leg of the carbon, and
 no sensible potential difference exists between the insulated metal plate
and the negative electrode of the lamps, whether the test be made by
a galvanometer, by an electrostatic voltmeter, or by a condenser.

of the lamp is exactly the same as the working potential difference of

Lamps when raised to High Incandescence." — In this paper Mr. Preeco describes a
very careful series of observations carried out with Edison incandescence lamps,
and which cover the same ground as a portion of the experiments here described.
The results given in (4), (7), and (11) confirm the facts which were first ascertained
by him. He also arrived at the general conclusion that the phenomena so observed
are due to an electric convection by matter projected from the incandescent carbon.
By carrying up the working electromotive force of the lamp to a point productive of
very high incandescence, he was able to measure the resulting current through a
galvanometer connected between the positive lamp electrode and the middle plate
corresponding to every degree of incandescence, and showed that, whilst increasing
up to a certain point, the galvanometer current fell off rapidly soon after a certain
critical temperature was reached, which corresponded to the appearance of a blue
light or haze in the glass receiver. — [Jan. 14th, 1890.]

 but   if measured    by a galvanometer the potential difference of the
 plate and the positive electrodes of the lamp is something less than
 that of the working lamp electrodes.
     (3.) This absolute equality of potential between the negative elec
 trode of the lamp and the insulated plate only exists when the carbon
 filament is in a state of vivid incandescence, and when the insulated
 plate is not more than an inch or so from the base of the negative leg.
 When the lamp is at intermediate stages of incandescence, or the
 plate is considerably removed from the base of the negative leg, then
 the plate is not brought down quite to the same potential as the nega
 tive electrode.
     (4.) A galvanometer connected between the insulated plate and tbe
 '
positive electrode of the lamp shows a current increasing from zero to
four or five milliamperes, as the earbon is raised to its state of com
mercial incandescence.        There is not any current greater than
0'O00l of a milliampere between tbe plate and negative electrode
when the lamp has a good -vacuum.
    (5.) If the lamp has a bad vacuum this inequality is destroyed, and
a sensitive galvanometer shows a current flowing through it when
connected between the middle plate and either the positive or nega
tive electrode.
    (.6.) When -the lamp is actuated by an alternating current a con
tinuous current is found flowing through a galvanometer, connected
between the insulated plate and either terminal of the lamp. The
direction of the current through the galvanometer is such as to show
that negative electricity is flowing from the plate through the gal
vanometer to the lamp terminal. This is also the case in (4) ; but, if
the lamp has a bad vacuum, then negative electricity flows from
the plate through the galvanometer to the positive terminal of the
lamp, and negative electricity flows to the plate through the gal
vanometer from the negative terminal of the lamp.
    (7.) The same effects exist on a reduced scale when the incan
descent conductor is a platinum wire instead of carbon filament.      The
platinum wire has to be brought up very near to its point of fusion,
in order to detect the effect, but it is found that a current flows
between the positive electrode of a platinum wire lamp and a platinum
plate placed in the vacuum near to the negative end of that wire.
    (8.) The material of which the plate is made is without influence.
Platinum, aluminium, and carbon have been indifferently employed.
    (9.) The active agent in producing this effect is the negative leg of
the carbon.      If the negative leg of the carbon is covered up by
enclosing it in a glass .tube this procedure entirely, or nearly entirely,
prevents the production of a current in a galvanometer connected
between the middle plate and the positive .terminal of the lamp.
    (10.) It is a matter of indifference whether a glass or metal tube is

employed to cover up the negative leg of the carbon ; in any case this
shielding destroys the effect.
   (11.) If, instead of shielding the negative leg of the carbon, a
mica screen is interposed between the negative leg and the side of
the middle plate which faces             it,
                                      then the current produced in      gal            a
vanometer connected between the positive termiual of the lamp and
the middle plate       much reduced.
                           is            Hardly any effect under the same
circumstances       produced
                      is       when  the  mica screen    interposed on that
                                                                   is
side of the metal plate which faces the positive leg of the carbon.
   (12.) The position of the metal plate has         great influence on the

magnitude of the current traversing a galvanometer connected
between the metal plate and the positive terminal of the lamp.          The
current     greatest when the insulated metal plate
           is                                                as near as pos

sible to the base of the negative leg of the carbon, and greatest of all
when   it   formed into

                                a
the base of the negative leg.
   The current becomes very small when the insulated metal plate                             is
removed to       or
                  4     inches from the negative leg, and becomes prac

experiments have been made with metal plates in all kinds of
 positions.
    (13.) The galvanometer current           greatly influenced by the surface
                                                is

at a distance of 18 inches from the negative leg, but even then                         it   is
just sensible to very sensitive galvanometer.

   (16.) If this last form of lamp is employed as in (4) the sub
sidiary carbon loop being nsed as a middle plate, and a galvanometer
being connected between it and either the positive or negative main
terminal of the lamp, then when the subsidiary carbon loop is cold,
we get a current through the galvanometer only when it is in con
nexion with the positive main terminal of the lamp, but when the sub
sidiary carbon is made incandescent by a separate insulated battery, we
get a current through the galvanometer when it is connected either
to the positive or to the negative terminal of the lamp.         In the first
case the current through the galvanometer is a negative current, flow
ing from the middle carbon to the positive main terminal, and in the
second case it is a negative current, from the negative main terminal
to the middle subsidiary hot carbon.
    (17.) If a lamp having a metal middle plate held between the legs
of the carbon loop has a galvanometer connected between the negative
main terminal of the lamp and this middle plate, we find that when
the carbon is incandescent there is no sensible current flowing through
the galvanometer.       The vacuous space between the middle plate
and the hot negative leg of the carbon possesses, however, a curious
unilateral conductivity.     If a single Clark cell is inserted in series
with the galvanometer, we find that this cell can send a current
deflecting the galvanometer when its negative pole is in connexion
 with the negative main terminal of the lamp, but if its positive pole
is in connexion with the negative terminal of the lamp, then no
current flows.    The cell is thus able to force a current through the
vacuous space when the direction of the cell is such as to cause nega
tive electricity to flow across the vacuous space from the hot carbon
to the cooler metal plate, but not in the reverse direction.
    (18.) If a vacuum tube is constructed, having at each end horse
 shoe carbon filaments sealed into it, and which can each be made
 separately incandescent by an insulated battery, we find that snch a
 vacuum tube, though requiring an electromotive force of many thou
 sands of volts to force a current through it when the carbon loops
 are used as electrodes and are cold, will yet pass the current from a
 single Clark cell when the carbon loop which forms the negative
 electrode is rendered incandescent.         It is thus found that a high
 vacuum terminated electrically by unequally heated carbon electrodes
 possesses an unilateral conductivity, and that electric discharge takes
 place freely through it under an electromotive force of a few volts
 when the negative electrode is made highly incandescent.
     (19.) These experimental results above described led the writer to
 investigate, in the same manner, the electric arc between carbon poles
 taken in air. If an electric arc is formed, in the usual way, between
 carbon poles, and a third insulated carbon pole is allowed to dip into
 or touch the electric arc, or, better still, has the electric arc projected

 1890.]      between Electrodes at different Temperatures.           123
against it by a magnet, it is found that this third or insulated pole
is brought down almost to the potential of the negative carbon of the
arc, and that a galvanometer connected between the third insulated
carbon and the negative carbon of the arc indicates no current, but
that if joined up between the positive carbon and the middle carbon
a strong current of about an ampere or so is found to be passing.      If
an electric bell or an incandescent lamp is joined up between the third
carbon and the negative carbon of the arc, they do not work ; but
if the bell or the lamp is joined between the positive carbon of the
arc and the third carbon, they are set in action by a strong current
passing through them.       These effects are produced, although the
third carbon (which is best held at right angles to the other two
forming the arc) is half or three quarters of an inch away from the
positive and negative carbon, the sole condition being that the flame
of the arc must touch or be projected by a magnet so as to touch this
third carbon. We have, therefore, similar phenomena in the case of
the arc and incandescence lamps.
    (20.) When the electric arc is being projected against the third
carbon, and has brought it down to the same potential, a galvano
meter joined in between the two carbons shows no current ; but this
space between the negative carbon of the arc and the third carbon
possesses a unilateral conductivity, and will pass the current from a
small battery of secondary cells one way, but not the other.         The
secondary battery when joined in series with the galvanometer
 sends a current, if its negative pole is in connexion with the nega
tive carbon of the arc, and its positive pole, through the galvano
meter, with the third carbon ; but if the secondary battery is reversed
in position it sends no current. Negative electricity can pass along
the flame-like projection of the arc from the hot negative carbon to
the cooler third carbon, but not in an opposite direction.
    (21.) If the arc is projected by means of a magnet for a long time
against the third insulated carbon, it craters it out in the same fashion
as the crater of the positive carbon, and the tip of this third carbon,
where it has received the flame-like blast of the arc, is converted into
graphite.
    The same effects are observed if an iron rod is used as a third pole,
and in this case tho end is converted into steel, and rendered so hard
as to be scarcely touched by the file when it has been quenched in
water.
    In seeking for an hypothesis to connect together these observed
facts, the one which suggests itself as most in accordance with the
facts is as follows : —
    In the case of a carbon incandescence lamp when at vivid incan
descence, carbon particles are being projected from all parts of the
filament, but chiefly from the negative, half of the loop. These carbon

 124           Prof. J. A. Fleming.       Electric Discharge      [Jan. 9,
molecules  carry negative charges of electricity, and when they impinge
upon a metal plate placed in the vacuum they can discharge them
selves if this plate is positively electrified, either by being in metallic
connexion with the positive electrode of the lamp or with a separate
positively charged body.       When the plate is simply insulated the
stream of negatively charged carbon molecules brings down this
insulated plate to the potential of the base of the negative leg, or to
the potential of that part of the carbon conductor from which it is
receiving projected molecules.         These carbon molecules projected
from an incandescent conductor can carry negative charges, but either
cannot be positively charged, or else lose a positive charge almost
instantly when projected off from the conductor.
   In the case of the electric arc we must suppose that the negative
carbon is projecting off a torrent of negatively electrified carbon
 molecules, and these, impinging against the positive carbon, wear out
a crater in it by a sand-blast-like action.
   The higher temperature of the positive carbon in a continuous
current arc is thus explained as due to the impact of the carbon mole
cules projected from the negative carbon.
   If  the electric arc is diverted against a third insulated lateral
carbon, the carbon blast from the negative carbon wears out a crater
in it and brings it down to the same potential as itself. The actions
going on in an electric arc may be considered to be somewhat as
follows : — When the carbons are first put together, the resistance at
the point of contact renders the extremities incandescent.           When
thus incandescent and separated, the electrification of each carbon is
sufficient to begin the projection of molecules from both positive and
negative carbons, probably most largely from the latter. The impact
of the molecular stream from the negative pole raises the tempera
ture of the positive carbon, and this again by radiation raises the
temperature of the negative carbon end. The electromotive force is
thus able to keep up a projection of negatively charged carbon mole
cules from the end of the negative carbon, which molecule6 are
loosened from the mass by heat, and then move away by electric
repulsion from the surface in virtue of the electric charge which they
retain. It would seem as if a hot carbon molecule cannot retain a
positive charge, and hence the potential difference between a third
insulated carbon and the positive carbon of the. arc is nearly the
same as the potential difference of the positive and negative carbons
of the arc. The rise of potential along the arc takes place very sud
denly just in the neighbourhood of the crater of the positive carbon.
   It has often been suggested that the electric arc contains a
counter-electromotive force.      It is questionable whether such experi
ments as those of Edlund (' Phil. Mag.,' vol. 36, 1868, p. 352) are
entirely conclusive on this point.

  1890.]           between Electrodes at different Temperatures.              125
     It   has been shown by other experimenters* that for arcs of vary,
  ing   length, but the same current, beyond a certain small initial length,
 the potential difference necessary to maintain the arc is proportional
 to the length of the arc plus a constant. This might thus be inter
  preted to mean that a certain proportion of the working electromo
 tive force of the arc was employed in detaching the carbon molecules
 from the mass of the poles, and that the excess alone is represented
 by the current produced in an arc of definite length.
      In the case of the incandescence lamps the hypothesis of the
 projection of negatively charged carbon molecules from the incan
 descent conductor, to which the name of molecular electrovection may
 be given, will suffice to explain all the various different effects pro
 duced by varying the surface, position, and distanco of the metal
 plate against which they impinge, and also the nullifying effect of
 shielding this plate from the negative leg of the carbon.
     That this molecular discharge goes on chiefly from the negative
 leg is additionally proved by the greater erosion which takes place
 in the deposit of carbon on the negative leg when the carbon is
 uniform and traversed by a continuous current.
     The hypothesis that a carbon molecule detached from an incan
 descent carbon surface in a high vacuum can only convey away a
negative charge, reconciles also the above described observed effects
in which a negative discharge ean be made out of a hot surface of
 carbon more easily than a positive discharge. When an electromotive
 force is applied to two metallic terminals or electrodes sealed into a
 good vacuum, it is well known that a certain initial electromotive
force has to be applied before any electric current begins to
 flow through the gas at all. It seems conclusively proved by
Mr. Crookes's researches that the nature of an electric discharge
through a high vacuum consists in a torrent of electrified particles
proceeding from the negative electrode.                If this is the case the
initial electromotive force required to begin a discharge through such
rarefied gas would naturally be reduced by heating the negative elec
trode, so as to favour and assist the detachment of the charged mole
cules of that electrode.        The effect of heating the negative electrode
in facilitating discharge through vacuous spaces has previously been
described by W. Hittorf (' Annalen der Physik und Chemie,' vol. 21,
1884, p. 90 — 139), and it is abundantly confirmed by the above
experiments.          We may say that a vacuous space bounded by two
electrodes one incandescent, and the other cold — possesses a uni
               —
lateral conductivity for electric discharge when these electrodes are
within a distance of the mean free path of projection of the mole-

  The chief object of the paper is to give a general method for the
problem of free stream lines in two-dimensional motion of liquids
when the boundaries are plane.        The method rests on the trans
formation from one diagram to another by means of functions of
complex variables, and, so far, is similar to that given by Kirchhoff
in his ' Vorlesungen,' which is, however, of very limited application.
   The first part is devoted to general theorems of transformation.

   V  satisfies  Laplace's equation.     Let the intrinsic equation of the
curve   ^o  in the z plane be
where s is the arc and A; the curvature.
   Then V satisfies the equation

along Vo-
   The transformation from one diagram to another is thereby
reduced to solving a potential problem with a given condition over
an infinite straight line.
   If ^0 is a straight line, we have simply dTV/rf^r = 0 along it.
   By this means are given two general theorems, of which one is
that of Schwarz, and the second may be stated as follows : —
   The transformation
                              du —      (z—zr)mr
                              dz        (2—1,)*
gives the potential of any number of infinitely long plane conductors,
all in the same plane, with parallel edges and at given potentials.
   Proceeding now to the hydrodynamical problem, x, y are the
co-ordinates of a point of the liquid, 0, '$-, the velocity and stream
functions.
   The boundaries of the diagram in the w plane are all straight, and
therefore Schwarz's theorem will transform to a w(EE p + iq) plane
in which the boundary is q = 0.
   Now, if v is the velocity of the fluid at (xy),
                       -. — .    dz     dz'
It  follows that V is constant along part of the line q = 0 and
dVjdq = 0 along the rest.
   The transformation theorem just given enables us then to find
V as a function of u, and therefore as a function of io.
   The general solution of the problem appears in the form
                           du
where 0(«) and/(«) are both factorial forms.
   Several particular cases are next worked out, the results of which
may here be given.

   It will    be observed   that they are all of such a character that in
going round the boundary of the z diagram we pass but twice from
free stream line to rigid boundary.
   It is only in these cases that the actual execution of the work is
feasible.

   If two polygons lie one within the other, the transformation of the
area between them which makes the boundaries ty curve is
                 dz                                       i_,
                -j— = nr{e[a(uj— ajr)]H[a(iu— uv)]} "          ,
where a.r is the internal angle of the polygon at w = a,r, and 9, H are
the elliptic functions usually so indicated.
   A similar transformation is given for the case in which one polygon
lies outside the other. The method is then applied to find the form
of hollow vortices in certain cases. The transformation which gives
the motion due to a stationary hollow vortex between two parallel
planes is
                         z = A log tn (w-^iK').

                            January 23, 1890.
      Sir G. GABRIEL STOKES, Bart., President, in the Chair.
    The President announced    that at the next meeting a Member of
Council    would be balloted for in place of the Rev. S. J. Perry,
deceased.
    The Presents received were laid on the table, and thanks ordered
for them.
    The following Papers were read : —
I. " On    a Photographic    Method for determining Variability in
       Stars." By Isaac Roberts, F.R.A.S.            Communicated by
       Professor J. Norman Lockyer, F.R.S. Received January
       14, 1890.
                               (Abstract.)
    Some of the uncertainties which necessarily attend the determina
tion of variability in the brightness of stars by eye observations are
removed by the application of photographic methods, and particularly
 by that of giving two or more exposures of the same photographic
 plate to a given sky space, with intervals of days or weeks between
each exposure.
    In this way any errors caused by atmospheric, actinic, or chemical
 changes, together with those due to personal bias, are eliminated,
 and the study of stellar variability can be pursued under conditions
 that admit of the necessary exactitude.
    As an illustration of the applicability of this dual photographic
 method, the enlargement on paper from the negative, which accom
 panies the full paper, shows the results obtained by two exposures of
 the same plate to the sky in the region of the great nebula in Orion.
 The first exposure was of two hours' duration on the 29th January,,
 and the second of two and a half hours on the 3rd February, 1889.
 The stellar images formed during the two exposures are 0-0122 of an
 inch apart, measured from centre to centre, and are therefore com
 parable with each other in the field of a microscope. When the images
 are examined in the manner thus indicated and their diameters also
 measured by means of a suitably made eye-piece micrometer, it is
 found that at least ten of the photographed stars, the magnitudes of
 which are estimated to range between the 7th and 15th, have
 changed to a considerable extent in the short interval of five days.

 138                                Dr.  J.  Hopkinson.                 (.Jan. 23,
    The ten stars referred to are to be found within an area of less than
two square degrees of the sky, and in the table given are the co
 ordinates of their positions with reference to theta Orionis.                   The
measurements of the diameters of their photo-images on a scale of
0.00002 of an inch are also given.
II. " Physical        Properties of Nickel Steel." By J. Hopkinson,
                 D.Sc., F.R.S. Received January 16, 1890.
    Mr. Riley, of the Steel Company of Scotland, has kindly sent me
samples of wire drawn             from the material concerning the magnetic
properties of which          I   recently made a communication to the Royal
Society.       As   already    stated,   this material contains 25 per cent, of
nickel and about 74 per cent, of iron, and over a range of temperature
from something below freezing to 580° C. it can exist in two states,
magnetic and non-magnetic.
    The wire as sent to me was magnetisable as tested by means of a
magnet in the ordinary way.                   On heating it to a dull redness it
became non-magnetisable whether it was cooled slowly or exceedingly
rapidly by plunging it into water.                  A quantity of the wire was
brought into the non-magnetisable state by heating it, and allowing
it to cool. The electric resistance of a portion of this wire, about
5 metres in length, was ascertained              in terms of the temperature ; it
was first of all tried at the ordinary temperature, and at temperatures
up to 340° C.           The specific resistances at these temperatures are
indicated      in the curve by the numbers 1, 2, 3. The wire was then
           fie Resistance.

cooled by means of solid carbonic acid, the supposed course of change
of resistance is indicated by the dotted line on the curve, the actual
observations of resistance, however, are indicated by the crosses in

 the neighbourhood of the letter A on the curve. The wire was then
 allowed to return to the temperature of the room, and was sub
sequently heated, the actual observations being shown by crosses on
the lower branch of the curve ; the heating was continued to a tem
perature of 680° C., and the metal was then allowed to cool, the
actual observations being still shown by crosses.    From this curve, it
 will be seen that in the two states of the metal, magnetisable and
 non-magnetisable, the resistances at ordinary temperatures are quite
different.   The specific resistance in the magnetisable condition is
about 0-000052, in the non-magnetisable condition it is about
0'000072.    The curve of resistance in terms of the temperature of
the material in the magnetisable condition has a close resemblance to
that of soft iron, excepting that the coefficient of variation is much
smaller, as, indeed, one would expect it to be in the case of an alloy;,
at 20° C. the coefficient is about 0-00132, just below 000° C. it is
about 0'0040, and above 600° it has fallen to a value less than that
which it had at 20° C. The change in electrical resistance effected
by cooling is almost as remarkable as the change in the magnetic
properties.
    Samples of the wire were next tested in Professor Kennedy's
laboratory for mechanical strength. Five samples of the wire were
taken which had been heated and were in the non-magnetisable state,
and five which had been cooled and were in the magnetisable state.
There was a marked difference in the hardness of theBe two samples ;
tne non-magnetisable was extremely soft, and the magnetisable
tolerably hard. Of the five non-magnetisable samples the highest
breaking stress was 50'52 tons per square inch, the lowest 48'75; the
greatest extension was 33'3 per cent., the lowest 30 per cent. Of the
magnetisable samples, the highest breaking stress was 88'12 tons per
square inch, the lowest was 85'76 ; the highest extension was 8"33, the
lowest 6-70. The broken fragments, both of the wire which had
originally been magnetisable and that which had been non-magnetis
able, were now found to be magnetisable. If this material could be
produced at a lower cost, these facts would have a very important
bearing.    As a mild steel the non-magnetisable material is very fine,
having so high a breaking stress for so great an elongation at
rupture.    Suppose it were used for any purpose for which a mild
steel is suitable on account of this considerable elongation at rupture,
if exposed to a sharp frost its properties would be completely
changed — it would become essentially a hard steel, and it would
remain a hard steel until it had actually been heated to a temperature
of about 600° C.

         Estuary like the Mersey." By L. F. VERNON-HARCOURT,

     A description      was given in a previous paper of the results of experi
 ments     with training walls in a working model of the tidal Seine ;* and
 the present investigations were carried out with a similar working

              Proceedings of the Royal Society,' vol. 45, p. 504, and Plates 2 to 4.

1890.]        Training Walls in an Estuary like the Mersey.         143
model of the Mersey estuary, from near Warrington to the open sea
beyond the bar, made to a horizontal scale of T^g^, and a vertical
scale of -j^j, and with a bed formed of fine Bagshot sand.    The expe
riments were directed to the solution of two problems, namely,
(1) The influence of training walls in the wide upper estuary on the
channel below Liverpool, and across the bar ; and (2) The effects of
training works in the lower estuary on the channel across the
bar.
    The model was first worked, without modification, till a fair repro
duction was obtained of the existing conditions of the estuary.
Training walls, made of strips of tin, were then inserted in the
model, following the lines of the Manchester Ship-Canal Scheme of
1884, down the middle of the upper estnary, for which the present
line of canal, in course of construction, skirting the Cheshire shore,
was substituted in 1885. This modification soon produced a change
 in the model, which no previous working had effected ; for, though
the channel between the training walls was deepened, the upper
estuary began to silt up as the working of the model proceeded, and
 the channel immediately below Liverpool began to shoal, till at last
                                               " narrows " became
the main navigation channel below the                               very
shallow for some distance.      This result solves a very much disputed
question as to the effects of these training works, and, together with
 the results of the Seine model, affords grounds for the conclusion
 that training walls placed in a sandy estuary, where sandbanks exist
 below them, will lead to accretion behind them.      As the channel in
 the lower estuary of the Mersey is almost wholly maintained by the
 tidal water flowing into and out of the estuary above, accretion in the
 upper estuary would necessarily produce a deterioration in the
channel below.
     The model was next restored to its original form, and training
  walls were inserted in the lower estuary, in continuation of the
 narrow channel between        Liverpool    and Birkenhead, gradually
 diverging out with a trumpet-shaped outlet, so as not to impede the
 tidal influx into the upper estuary. The scour through this trained
 channel gradually washed away a sandbank to the north of the out
 let, and eventually formed a channel to the north of the previous
 channel, towards Formby Point, in the model, with a minimum
 depth considerably more than was previously obtained across the
 bar.
    The bed of the model was then restored to its previous state ; but
 the training walls in the lower estuary were retained, and a sand
 bunk impeding the outlet was removed to the level of the bar. The
 scour through the trained channel, with this arrangement, produced
 a more direct and uniform channel than in the previous case, with a
 similar increase in depth.

144               Mr. C. S. Sherrington.             On outlying      [Jan. 30,
   These experiments indicate that, whereas training walls in the
upper estuary would be injurious, owing to the resulting accretion,
training walls in the lower estuary would improve the depth of the
ontlet channel ; and that such training walls, combined with
dredging, offer the best prospect of forming a direct stable, and
deepened channel across the bar.
II. " On outlying Nerve-cells in the Mammalian Spinal Cord."

      by Professor M. FOSTER, Sec. R.S. Received January 30,

   Gaskell has shown* that in the cord of the alligator scattered nerve-
cells are to be seen at the periphery of the lateral column. Although
nerve-cells appear to be absent from that position in the spinal cord
of Mammalia as represented by the rabbit, cat, dog, calf, monkey,
and man, yet there are in these animals isolated nerve-cells present
in the white matter of the cord, not only in the deeper portions of the
lateral column, but in the anterior and posterior columns as well.
   In the anterior columns occasional nerve-cells, of the multipolar
kind, lie among those fibre-bundles which pass between the deeper
mesial border of the anterior horn and the anterior commissure at
the base of the anterior fissure.        They, in the instances observed, are
smaller than the large cells characteristic of the anterior horn, and
lie with two of the processes directed parallel with the horizontal
transverse fibres among which they are placed. Such cells have been
observed in the human cord and in the cord of the dog and bonnet
monkey.
   In the lateral column, of the spinal cord of man and the other
animals named above, it is common to find outlying members of the
group of small cells of the lateral horn, Clarke's tractus intermedio-
lateralis, situated in the white matter, distinctly beyond the limits of
the grey.     Some outlying cells here are placed at a great distance
from the grey. These are all probably to be considered members of
the intermedio-lateral group.         Their similarity to those cells in form
and size is striking.       They are generally placed upon, or at least in
close connexion with, the fine connective-tissue septa which pass
across the white matter.        It is probable that the cells are connected '
with the medullated nerve-fibres running along these septa.                 The
cells are fusiform, with the longer axis parallel to the direction of
the nerve-fibres running in the septa.

 1890.]        Nerve-cells in  the  Mammalian    Spinal Cord.             145
formation numerous nerve-cells are to be found among the interlacing
bands of nerve-fibres. These are often fusiform, but in many cases
multipolar ; they are for the most part small, but occasional large
individuals can be found ; the latter would appear always to be multi
polar. Where the lateral column comes into contact with the lateral
limb of the substantia gelatinosa of the caput cornu posterioris
ganglion-cells can frequently be seen in it. The larger axis of these
cells is parallel to the outline of the caput cornu. They seem to exist
most numerously in regions, such as the lumbo-sacral, in which
medullated fibres, probably posterior root-fibres, sweep through the
deeper part of the lateral column round the lateral limb of the
gelatinosa as if to reach the base of the posterior horn.
    In the posterior columns outlying nerve-cells are also to be found,
 especially in the human cord.         In these columns the cells appear to
 be outstanding members of the posterior vesicular group of Clarke.
 They are best seen in the upper lumbar and lower dorsal regions.
 They are large, measuring in some instances 70 p across.                  In
appearance they closely resemble the cells of Clarke's column. They
are nearly always of broadly ovate shape. They appear always to lie
on or in close relation to those horizontal bundles of nerve-fibres
 which curve in a ventro-lateral direction from the depth of the extero-
 posterior column into the grey matter in the neighbourhood of the
 posterior vesicular group.       The longer axis of the cell is placed
 parallel  to the nerve-fibres  it lies upon or among.    Where a process
 from the bipolar cell-body can be followed, it disappears in a direction
 which is that of the surrounding nerve-fibres. The cell would seem
 in the majority of cases to lie with its length in a plane at right
 angles to the long axis of the cord.       Frequently the cells lie close to
 the grey substance of Clarke's column, but in some specimens they
 occupy positions far removed from the grey matter ; they may even
lie near the periphery of the extero-posterior column.
    The chief interest attaching to nerve-cells lying in the white matter
of the spinal cord is that they may be supposed to be connected with
the nerve-fibres among which they are, and that from that fact some
knowledge may be gained as to the anatomy of themselves, and of
the group of which they may be outlying individuals, or of the fibre-
bundles containing them.
    With regard to the cells existing among fibres passing to the
white commissure of the cord, it is legitimate to consider their
presence as evidence in favour of the view that some of the cells of
the median portion of the ventral grey horn are directly connected
with medullated fibres passing to or from the opposite half of the
cord by way of the anterior commissure.
    The cells in the lateral column outside the lateral horn may be
taken to point to the connection of the intermedio-lateral group of

Clarke with tho nerve-fibres which radiate in bundles from the grey
matter of that region into the lateral column, and to show that some
of the fibres with which these are related pass out transversely well
 into that area which is occupied almost exclusively (man) by fibres
of the crossed pyramidal tract. Concerning some of the outlying
cells in the more dorsal portion of the lateral column, the same in
 ferences may be drawn ; and some of them would seem to be con
 nected with fibres of the posterior roots that curve round the lateral
aspect of the caput cornu posterioris.            Of the outlying cells in tho
posterior column, if they are outlying members of Clarke's group, the
relations which they suggest for that group are —
    i. That the group is connected directly with certain of the median
 fibres of the posterior spinal roots, namely, those which after an up
 ward course in Burdach's column plunge into the grey matter of the
 base of the posterior horn.
    ii. That some at least of the cells of that group are interpolated,
more or less immediately, into the course of medullated nerve-fibres
of large calibre.
    The question naturally arises, May not these cells in the posterior
column of the Mammalian cord represent the bipolar cells discovered
by Freud,* in the cord of Petromyzon Planeri, to be in direct com
munication with fibres of the posterior roots ? If so may Clarke's
column be considered a portion of the ganglion of the posterior spinal
nerve-root which has been retained in the interior of the spinal cord
in the thoracic and certain other regions ?

                                  (Abstract.)
    The older views of the transformations of the reserve products of
this plant, as advanced by Sachs and other writers, took account only
of the oil present in the cells, and were briefly, that it undergoes by
oxidation a conversion into carbohydrate, the idea of this change being
chiefly based on the observation that as the oil disappears from tho
endosperm daring germination, starch appears in various parts of the
embryo.      Later writers have suggested the existence of a ferment,
splitting up the fat into glycerine and fatty acid, and the further trans
formation of the latter into the starch.

 1890.]             the Seed       of   the   Castor- oil Plant.        147
   The work embodied in this paper deals (a) with the agencies which,
during germination, render the reserve materials available for the use
of the embryo, (fc) with the forms in winch these are absorbed by it
 and the mode of their absorption, and (c) with the parts played iu the
 process by the endosperm and the embryo respectively.
     1. The agencies at work. — A ferment is found to exist as a zymogen
 in the resting seed, which is readily developed by warmth and weak
 acids into an active condition.      The results of its activity are the
 splitting up of the fat with formation of glycerine and (chiefly)
 ricinoleic acid. Further changes, brought about by the protoplasm of
 the endosperm cells, form from the latter a lower carbon acid which,
 nnlike ricinoleic acid, is soluble in water and is crystalline. These
 changes do not take place in the absence of free oxygen.      A quantity
 of sugar also is formed, which appears to have the glycerine as its
 antecedent.                   t
    The proteids of the seed, which consist of globulin and albumose, are
 split up by another ferment, with formation of peptone and asparagin.
 This ferment resembles closely the ferment previously described by
 the writer as occurring in germinating lupin seeds.
     2. The forms in which the reserve materials are absorbed. — Exam
 ination of the seeds during the whole course of absorption shows that
 the only products which enter the embryo are a crystalline acid,
 sugar, possibly some peptone, and asparagin. Consideration of the
structure of the cotyledons, which are the absorbing organs, shows
that the mode of absorption is always dialysis, a view antagonistic to
that of Sachs, who has put forward the idea of a penetration of the
cell walls by the unchanged oil. It follows from this that the starch
seen by him and other observers in the tissues of the young embryo
was the result of a re-formation from the diffusible bodies now
traced.
    3. The relative influence of the endosperm and the embryo. — The
changes are found to be initiated in the endosperm, for they take
place, though more slowly, when the embryo is carefully removed.
The latter has, however, an influence upon the process, germination
being more rapid when        it,
                               or even part of       left in contact with
                                                       it,
                                                       is
the endosperm.      Thisis  shown not to be due to simple removal of the
products   of the  decompositions, but   rather to be regarded as due to
                                              is                         a
stimulus of a physiological nature caused by the commencing develop
ment of the embryo.
    4. An additional point of interest in the progress of the germination
is the liberation in the endosperm of a rennet ferment of considerable
vigour. At present an explanation of the action of this          difficult,
                                                                   is
though experiments are still proceeding with a view to clearing it up.

    The recent synthesis of a true glucose (" acrose ") by Fischer and
Tafel,* from acrolein (acrylic aldehyde) and also from glycerin,f in
conjunction with the additions to our knowledge of the constitution
of dextrose and larvulose by Kiliani,J &c., suggests fresh attention to
the " aldehyde theory

                                     regarding the synthetical formation of carbo
hydrate in green plants.
   It is now widely believed by vegetable physiologists that a glucose
is produced in the first instance from C02 and H20, but the nature
of the intermediate changes is still uncertain.                         The experiments
described in this paper were commenced to ascertain whether starch
can be produced in the assimilating cells of a green plant by sup
plying it with acrolein or closely related bodies, and subsequently
extended to other organic compounds related to carbohydrates.
    The well-known theory § that formic aldehyde (HCOH) is first
produced from COt and H20, and then becomes polymerised to
glucose, has not yet received any direct experimental proof, although
it is stated by Reinke|| that formic aldehyde has been detected in the
product obtained by distilling the leaves of several plants with water.
    The artificial polymerisation of formic aldehyde appears to yield a
complex mixture of aldehyde and ketone alcohols, which has been
variously described as methylenitan, formose, pseudo-formose, &c.
Quite recently Fischer^f and Loew** have independently stated that a
small quantity of a true glucose can be proved to occur in " formose "
by the phenylhydrazine reaction.ff According to Loew this polymeri
sation only occurs with dilute solutions of the aldehyde, and better
with PbO or Pb(OH)3 than Ca(OH)3.
    Loew supports the view that formic aldehyde is formed as an

that this is also true for solutions of aldehyde (acetic) and trioxy-
methylene.
     A. Meyer's paper ('Botan. Zeitnng,' 1886, pp. ftl, 105, 129, 145)
 is  frequently referred to throughout the following pages.
     It is well knownf that starch is formed by the leaves of green
 plants when they are supplied with solutions of glucose or cane-sugar
 (saccharon) : but very few experiments have been made to ascertain
 how far this is true for other organic compounds.                        A. Meyer has
 extended such investigations to the behaviour of leaves placed in
  solutions of other carbohydrates and a few other compounds ; his
  researches are frequently referred to throughout the following pages.
  He found that starch is formed by leaves placed in solutions of
  glucose, saccharon, mannite, inulin, and glycerin.
      Meyer's method consisted in placing leaves which had been de
  prived of starch in the dark in solutions of the substances.                      I have
  extended the investigation to other substances — especially aldehydes
  and substances         related chemically to carbohydrates, using different
  methods       and devoting especial attention to the formation or not of
  starch in the leaves of green plants when organic substances are
  supplied through the medium of their roots and not directly to the
  leaves.
      E. LaurentJ        has   confirmed Meyer's        observation      that   starch    is
  formed from glycerin.
      Wehmer's negative results with formic aldehyde and formose have
  been    already alluded to.
      Meyer (loc. cit.) has shown that starch is not formed by leaves
  from solutions of raffinose,              inosite, erythrite, dulcite,§ trioxy-
  methylene, aldehyde (acetic).
      Neither Meyer, Laurent, nor Wehmer describes any experiments
  with reference to the supply of the substances used to the roots of
  plants.
      In the following        pages where the compounds used have also been
  employed by Meyer; as described                 above, his results are stated in
  giving details of experiments, but            I  did not generally make observa-

  tions on shoots (vide groups A and C in detailed account) where
  Meyer has obtained positive results.
      I am indebted to Professor S. H. Vines for the suggestion to
                                                        "
  experiment with an "extiact of natural humus (see No. 12, p. 172).
                       Methods and Apparatus Employed.
     The experiments with each of the substances employed are classified
 as follows : —
     A. Experiments with cut branches.
     B. Experiments with solutions supplied to the roots of plants
 placed in a culture liquid, or in a few cases in sand moistened with
 the same.
     C. Experiments where the solutions were          applied externally   by
 placing on the upper surfaces of leaves.
     All  the investigations were made as far as possible with plants,
 shoots, leaves, &c., in a healthy condition, and results are not stated
 in any cases where there was reason to believe that the plants, <fcc.,
 had been injured      by preliminary manipulations or exceptionally un
favourable     conditions   during the progress of the trials.
     As is generally the case in experiments with culture solutions, algoe,
 fungi, &c., often developed in the solutions, although the cylinders
 were surrounded with black paper and the liquids had been pre
 viously boiled ; where this occurred to any considerable extent the
cultures were repeated with fresh plants. In a few cases the roots
 of the plants were placed in damp sand and the sand moistened
 with the substances in use. The sand had been strongly heated in a
 muffle just before using.       The words "sand culture," placed against
 some of the results in the detailed account, signify that this method
 had been used instead of the ordinary water culture.
     To deprive the leaves and tissues of starch at the beginning of the
 experiments, two methods were resorted to : —
     (1.) Placing in the dark until portions of the leaves were shown
by testing to be completely free from starch.
     (2.) Placing under a bell-jar with substances which entirely remove
all C02 from the air until the same result was obtained.             Of these
methods the latter was found to be the more convenient and used in
nearly all cases. In the case of seedling plants the cotyledons must
obviously be removed before placing under the bell-jar; but this
operation need not cause any injury to the plant if carefully per
formed and the young plant has formed sufficient ordinary foliage
leaves to be independent of the cotyledons.         The apparatus used was
as   described  on p.  154,  and is represented in section  by diagram No. 1
on the opposite page.

water were   placed    in a cylinder containing the culture solution and
the seedling plants either in the same or in a cylinder containing
damp sand moistened with the culture solution.        When it had been
found by testing portions of the tissues that the plants, &c., were
entirely free from starch, they were at once transferred to fresh
cylinders containing the different solutions and placed under other
bell-jars similarly fitted.
   The apparatus shown in diagram No. 1 and described on the next
page was always used in the first instance, but where positive results

154          Mr. E. H. Acton.          The Assimilation        of Carbon
were obtained the trials were repeated, using the modified cylinder
described below and figured on p. 155 (diagram No. 2).
    In testing the tissues for starch Sachs' well-known method was
used    ; in cases where the results were negative the " potash method
                                                                                     "
recommended for small quantities of the substance was employed.                      I
generally also made a micro-chemical examination of portions of the
tissues in addition to the direct tests.
    The bell-jar (see diagram No. 1) is accurately ground to fit the
glass plate, the surfaces in contact are covered with a mixture of
vaseline, resin, and beeswax, which is extremely tenacious, and
entirely prevents any access of air in this direction.*
    The india-rubber stopper is perforated with two holes, through
which glass tubes are inserted connected with soda-lime (J-*UDes;
this arrangement allows a free circulation between air in the bell-jar
and external atmosphere, but entirely deprives any air entering the
apparatus of C02.          Any C02 derived from respiration of the plants
 is at once absorbed by the KOH or soda-lime, so that the air in the
 bell-jar is entirely destitute of C02 during the whole course1 of experi
 ment.
     Two vessels of water (not shown in diagram No. 1) are also
placed under the bell-jar to prevent any chance of the air being
 rendered too dry by the soda-lime.               The water in these vessels is
 deprived of any      CO.,  which   it may contain in solution by the addition
 of baryta- water (Ba(OH)2).
     Since the experiments showing a positive result are open to the
 possible objection that C02 might be evolved by decomposition in the
 solution, and be absorbed by the leaves before it was taken up by the
 soda-lime or potash, I repeated these with the modified apparatus
 shown on the opposite page (diagram No. 2).
     In this case any C02 evolved from decompositions in the culture
 solution could not find its way to the leaves ; but, at the same time, a
 free circulation of air is allowed between the space at top of the
 cylinder and that in the bell-jar.          Except for this modification in the
 cylinder containing       the  culture  solution, the apparatus is the same as
 described above ; instead of the plant stem being simply passed
through a hole in cork of cylinder, the insertion is made gas-tight, as
    * Sachs, Godlewski, &c., in similar experiments close the bottom of the bell-jnr
by placing it in a dish containing strong KOH solution, through which they intro
 duce tubes (curved) to allow a free circulation        of air, &c. The arrangement
 described in the text is equally efficacious and more convenient to employ, as the
cylinder, dishes, 4c., stand on a glass plate instead of in KOH solution.       In the
first experiment with each apparatus used, a portion of the air was withdrawn from
the bell-jar, collected over mercury, and tested for C02 by the ordinary methods of
gas analysis at various intervals ; in all cases the air in the apparatus was found to
be completely free from COa.

jars containing water and plants were exposed in a window —

period leaves tested as described were found to contain no traces of

    The plants were then rapidly transferred to other jars containing the
same solutions as used in the previous experiments (see next page),
with the addition of sufficient barium acetate to leave an excess of the
salt for withdrawal of any C02 formed during the experiment, but in
no case did the amount of soluble barium salts at the beginning of
the experiment exceed 2'5 per cent, barium (4'2 per cent. BaS04 on

 any particular reason beyond the fact that I had an abundant supply
 of them at hand in the ground behind St. John's College Laboratory,
  where all these experiments were conducted.
     The seedling plants of Tilia, Acer, Cheiranthus,              Campanula,
 Euphorbia were all obtained from the place mentioned.                Those of
  Quercus   were  brought   from a neighbouring field,   and planted in the
 garden in front of the laboratory.
     The young plants of Phaseolus multiflorus and P. vulgaris were
 raised from seed in damp sawdust, and planted out till required for
 use.
    The other plants were growing in the garden and immediate
 vicinity. As I did not in any cases find the results differing with
 the plants used where I considered the experiments had            been  satis
 factorily carried out, I selected those which seemed best         adapted   to

   The acrolein was prepared by the usual method,* viz., distillation
of glycerin and acid potassium sulphate, the distillate being in the
first instance collected in a receiver over PbO and CaCU to remove
                                                                                     "

acrolein vapour was passed into strong aqueous ammonia, the excess
of ammonia driven off by warming, and the reddish solid acrole'in-
ammouia precipitated by addition of excess of ether alcohol.
   The solid was dissolved in water immediately before use.

crystals are somewhat insoluble, can be easily prepared in the ordinary
way for these compounds.               Composition, 2NaHS03'C3H40.
   Owing to the fact that acrolein is very liable to undergo spon
taneous decomposition on standing in contact with water, and the
extremely offensive nature of the substance in a free state, I employed
certain soluble acrolein compounds, as well as the uncombined alde
hyde; but, although these compounds did not act so prejudicially on
the plants, they caused them to assume an unhealthy appearance after
4 — 5 days, and two out of six plants which had been grown in the
solutions under the conditions described on p. 160 failed to recover
when again planted under normal circumstances, although fully
supplied with water and shaded from intense direct sunlight.
   Details of these experiments are given on the following pages.
I think they prove conclusively that plants are unable to form starch
in their leaves from acrolein or its compounds when supplied to them
as such, and that it is therefore doubtful whether the synthesis of
glucose by Fischer and Tafel from acrolein has any direct bearing on
the. formation of starch in plants.               The results with ordinary alde
hyde (acetaldehyde) and some of its compounds were also negative

    (2.1 Finding that starch was formed under these circumstances,               I
commenced a new series of experiments, in order to observe whether
the plants were able to withdraw the whole of the glucose from
solutions, and how long a time was required for the first formation of
starch.      As the young plants of Cheiranthus              were   growing most
vigorously at this time, I used them for this purpose.
    The first point was easily answered in the affirmative.             Using the
previously mentioned culture solution (containing 1 per cent, of
glucose), such an amount was taken as to contain 3¦57 grams of
glucose (about 400 c.c.) ; six plants of Cheiranthus Cheiri, with their
roots immersed in the solution, had completely absorbed all the
glucose at the end of five or six days. In another similar experiment,
I found that three plants of Acer pseudoplatanus absorbed 1"86 gram
of glucose in eight days, but a fungus mycelium was beginning to
form at the end of this time, which may have assisted in removing
the glue ,se. It was proved that all the glucose had disappeared from
the solutions by the usual methods of testing, viz., with Fehling's
solution, Ac., &c.
 ¦ In
        regard to the second point, I never found any formation of
starch to occur with less than ten hours' exposure to light; but it is
obvious that experiments of this kind are of very little value, as it is
not possible to determine to what extent the previous treatment to
deprive tissues of starch has affected the normal assimilation processes.

    As would be expected, those plants which had been deprived of
 starch    by keeping in the dark were considerably longer showing
 starch formation in their leaves than those which had been brought
 into a similar condition under the bell-jars by the absence of carbon
supply (CO.,), although plants as nearly as possible of the same age
and size were originally selected, and in each case used for the
cultures as soon as they were found to be completely free from starch.

required are given below.

   * Since the free aldehyde is a very volatile substance, giving off vapour at ordi
 nary temperatures, it must be considered doubtful whether the injurious effect of
 the substance in the above experiment is to be attributed to action on the roots
 in solution, or to action of the vapour on the leaves.
    A few drops of pure aldehyde allowed to evaporate under a receiver containing
 a plant of Acer pseudoplatanus quickly (24 hours) caused the death of the latter,
 as would be expected.

    * As A. Meyer states that leaves form starch when placed in 10 per cent, solu
tions of glycerin, it must be assumed that the root tissues are affected in these
experiments, or that suoh strong solutions are unable to travel from the root to
 leaves.

is therefore one of the " ketonio aoids," which have been so largely used in recent

     The saccharon        used was pure cane-sugar obtained from Kahlbaum,
  of Berlin   ;  it  gave no reduction on heating with Fehling's solution
  at 100° for ten minutes.             Many specimens       of ordinary cane-sugar
  contain a considerable amount of glucose,                 and are obviously un
 suitable for such investigations.
     A. As A. Meyer and E. Laurent* have shown that starch is
 formed by leaves, cut branches, &c., placed in the solutions of cane-
 sugar, I did not repeat these experiments.

    Wishing to determine whether saccharon is as readily absorbed by
the roots     of plants as glucose (compare No. 3, p. 162), I selected six
young plants of Cheiranthus                Cheiri, as nearly as possible of equal
size, so that three of them were about the same weight as the other
three (a = three plants, B = three nearly similar plants ; B weighed
0.01 gram more than a) ; (a) were placed in a cylinder containing
 100 c.c. of the culture solution                 + 0-5 glucose ; B in a similar

cylinder containing        100 c.c. of the     culture    solution + 0-5 gram
saccharon.
    The two cylinders were placed under the same bell-jar and arranged
so as   to be as nearly as possible illuminated to the same extent.
    After three days (the leaves of (o) and (B) then containing starch)
I  determined the remaining glucose and saccharon in the cylinders by
making up to an equal volume in each case and withdrawing an
aliquot part for analysis.
    Of the glucose 0'237 gram remained (absorbed 0-263 gram).
    Of the saccharon 0302 gram remained (absorbed 0.198 gram).
    This experiment was confirmed by arranging another six plants in
a similar manner and testing each day how much of the glucose
and saccharon had been removed during the preceding twenty-four
hours.
    Commencing on the second day after placing the cylinders in the
bell-jar, it was found at the beginning of the third day that —
    (2nd to 3rd day}, in 24 hours, 0.085 gram glucose, O'OBl gram
                              saccharon.
     (3rd to 4th day), in 24 hours, 0'074 gram glucose, 0-062 gram
                              saccharon.
    I therefore     conclude that glucose is more readily taken up by the
roots    of  plants (from 5 per cent, solutions) than saccharon.*
                      No. 8. Experiments with " Dextrins."
     The dextrins used were of two kinds : — 1. Erythro-dextrin ; 2.
 Achroo-dextrin.
                                                   " dextrin " in
     Erythro-dextrin used was obtained as                          dry state from
 Messrs. Hopkin and Williams, of London.                It was well -washed with
 strong alcohol before solution in water, to remove any traces of
 glucose.
     The achroo-dextrin was prepared from the above by .heating with
                               " calcium chloride bath "
 5 per cent.     H2S04 on a                                   (temperature above
 100°) till the solution, neutralised with BaC03, gave no trace of reac
 tion with I in KI.
     The dextrin was then precipitated by the addition of strong (95
 per cent.) alcohol and washed with the same until the washings were
 perfectly free from
                           " reducing " substances, dried, and dissolved in
  water.
    * This result is not in keeping with the experiences of A- Meyer as to the rela
 tive value of glucose and saccharon. When leaves are placed in 10 per cent,
 solutions he finds starch to be more readily formed from saccharon than dextrose
  (glucose).   I have not experimented with " laevulose."

                         Experiments with. Extract of Natural Humtcs."
     An extract of " humus " was obtained by digesting the soil — a light
leaf mould — with dilute alcohol on a water-bath for eight hours and
filtering through asbestos and powdered glass.                      The alcohol was dis
tilled off on a water-bath, the residual solution diluted with water,
and again filtered as above.                  100 c.c. of this solution evaporated to
dryness at 110° C. left 0-3708 grain of solid residue, which showed
on combustion that it contained 15 per cent, of carbon.*
     As bacteria, fungi, algae, &c., rapidly make their appearance when
such a solution is allowed to stand,               I  found it convenient to keep the
alcoholic extract, referred to above, and evaporate off the alcohol just
before use.

     Cane-sugar (saccharon)t was boiled with strong solution of KOH
for half an hour, and the whole solution diluted with water and then
acidified with HC1, which causes the separation of flocculent brown
" humus-like " substances. The precipitate was washed with dilute
acid, dried, and then boiled with water ; the aqueous extract so pre
pared was used in these experiments after filtering through paper.
     The above aqueous extract contained about 2 per cent. of solid sub

chief constituents of natural " humus," which must be chiefly derived from the

       That green plants cannot normally obtain carbon for " assimilation "
  from any substances except carbohydrates or bodies closely related to
  them ;    not from aldehydes        or their derivatives, and not from       all
  carbohydrates even.
      That a compound may be a source of carbon when supplied to the
  leaves,   but not when supplied to the roots, and vice versd.
     That (since parasitic and saprophytic plants, and especially fungi,
  undoubtedly do always obtain their carbon from complex organic
 substances)      green plants, owing to the normal process of obtaining
 carbon     being from C02, have to a large extent lost the power of using
 such    substances as a source of carbon.
     That     many green      plants   (? all)    behave  in the same manner
 towards such substances.
     [Contrast    fungi, which often are characterised by decomposing
 special    substances.]
    That (since neither leaves nor roots can avail themselves of carbon
 in the form of aldehyde           or its compounds — formose, allyl alcohol,
 acrolein, laevulinic acid, 4c.) it is still uncertain whether or not a
single substance      of an aldehydic or ketonic nature is really formed by
 plants as an    intermediate product between C02 and H20 and glucose
 (or   starch) ; but, if such is produced, it can only be polymerised by
the     plant under special conditions,* probably at the moment of
formation.

                               (Abstract.)
   The object of the present memoir       the extension to systems of
                                               is
algebraical quantities of the new theory of symmetric functions which
has been developed by the author in regard to a single system in
Volume 11 and succeeding volumes of the 'American Journal of
Mathematics.'   In the theory of the single system the conceptions
and symbolism are to a large extent arithmetical, and are based upon
the properties of single integral numbers and their partitions into
single integral parts. In this sense the theory may be regarded as
being unipartite.    In the present generalisation to the case of 't
systems of quantities the fundamental ideas proceed, not from a
single number, but from a collection of m single numbers. In regard
to number, weight, degree, part, and suffix, the collection of in
numbers invariably replaces the single number of the theory of the
single system.    In this view the theory of the m systems     wi-partite.
                                                                      is
   The quantities, to which the symmetric functions      relate, may be
regarded as the solutions common to m non-homogeneous equations
each in m variables.     Schlafii, in the Vienna Transactions (Denk-
                                               '                           '
echriften) for  1852, added  another linear non-homogeneous equation
in m variables, and then forming the eliminant of the m       equations,
                                                                  +   1

  1890.]      Functions   of   the  Roots  of  Systems  of Equations.           177
  thereby    obtained an identity which is fundamental in the subject.
  This identity involves those symmetric functions which are here
  termed fundamental, and marks the starting point of the present
  investigation.
     The memoir is divided into sixteen sections.           In   § 2 a preliminary
  algebraic theory is given, and then in § 3 is commenced the theory of
  the differential operations.       A prominent feature presents itself in
  the very interesting correspondence         between the algebras of quantity
  and   differential operation.
     In  § 4 is discussed    the theory of three identities, formed similarly
  to the fundamental        identity alluded to above, and such that the
 quantities involved are related in a particular manner.               The theory
 of differential    operation proceeds collaterally with that of quantity.
  The succeeding four sections,          § 5-§ 8, are devoted to the results
  which flow in a direct manner from this discussion.                In particular,
  three distinct laws of symmetry are established, large generalisations
                                                         '
  of those established by the author in the                American Journal of
  Mathematics' (loe. cit.).        Of these the first two are of importance,
  and are examined in detail.        A leading idea in these theorems, as in
  the whole investigation, is the
                                       " separation " of a partition ; the
                                                                              sepa
 ration bears the same relation to the partition as the partition to the
 number or collection of numbers.           The first law of symmetry appears
 to be of cardinal rank in symmetrical algebra.              It involves, at sight,
 a law of expressibility in the theory of separations which is of a
 general character. It demonstrates at once the possibility of forming
 a pair of symmetrical         tables of symmetric functions in connexion
 with every partition of every collection of m numbers (regard being
 paid as well to order as to magnitude).            The necessary tables for the
 bipartite theory (i.e., of two systems) as far as the weight, four
 inclusive, are exhibited in § 14.         An extension of the Vandermondo
 Waring law for the expression of the sums of the powers of the roots
of an equation by means of the coefficients is generalised, in a single
formula, from two points of view' in § 6.           In § 9 and § 10 the decom
position is effected of the operations previously encountered in § 3.
The linear weight operations are found to break up into as many
linear partition operations as the weight possesses partitions.                 An
important theorem is reached when it is established that the annihila
tion of a symmetric function by a linear weight operation necessitates
annihilation by each partition operation of the same weight. The
weight operations of higher orders, partially examined in § 3, which
may be termed
                      " obliterating," from their characteristic
                                                                         property,
break up similarly into partition operations which possess an oblite
rating property in regard to products of symmetric functions.                    In
this manner all the differential operations of § 3 are adapted for use
in the theory of separations, as distinct from the theory ordinarily
                                                                        p 2

considered,   which is in fact that of fundamental or single-unitary
symmetric    functions.
   These partition operations possess an algebra also in exact corre
spondence with the algebra of quantity.
   In § 10 the partition obliterating operations are applied to the
theory of multiplication.
   In § 12 a transformation is established by means of which func
tions of differences can, with special exceptions, be converted into
non-siDgle-unitary symmetric functions. This theorem is the analogue
of the transformation of the theory of invariants first given by the
author in Vol. 6 of the ' American Journal of Mathematics.'
   § 15 proves a useful law to which the tabular numbers are subject,
connected with the idea of grouping the separations together in a
particular manner.
   In conclusion the memoir consolidates and largely generalises the
author's recent researches alluded to above at the beginning of the
Abstract.

 I. "The Liquation of Gold                     and Platinum Alloys."               By
       Edward Matthey, F.S.A., F.C.S., Associate Royal School
       of Mines.         Communicated by the President.                    Received
       January 17, 1890.
   It  is a well known fact that when molten alloys of certain metals
are cooled, some of the constituents separate and become concentrated
either in the centre or in the external portions of the solidified mass ;
to this segregation the name of liquation is given. It is specially
noticeable in the case of silver-copper alloys, and its importance is
now being widely recognised in almost all branches of metallurgy.
   In the case of gold, however, the phenomenon of liquation does not
appear to have been much observed.                    Gold alloys, to the value of
many millions sterling, pass annually from hand to hand upon the
results of assays cut from the external portions of ingots, which
assays cannot, of course, be trustworthy, if the centre of the bars
differs in composition from the external portions.                       Peligot has
recently endeavoured to obtain evidence of liquation in gold-copper
alloys, and has concluded that it does not exist.* Roberts-Austen,f
who has devoted much time to the study of liquation, has also
satisfied himself that gold-silver alloys do not rearrange themselves
on cooling.  J
   It is, of course, well known that gold does not retain on                 solidify
ing certain metals of the platinum group ; for instance,                     iridium,
when associated with it, always tends to fall through the fluid metal,
and is found at the bottom of the solidified mass, but this is probubly
not a case of true rejection of a metal by liquation, but is due to the
higher specific gravity of the iridium, coupled with the fact that the
usual heat at which gold is melted is not sufficiently high to bring

 1890.]        The Liquation. of Gold and Platinum Alloys.           181
about a true alloy. It appeared to me that alloys of gold and
platinum would well repay examination. They have been generally
considered to be uniform in composition, but certain results which       I
obtained in the course of their treatment led me to suspect that they
wonld give interesting results, and the following experiments were
therefore undertaken.                                       •
    The metal platinum frequently occurs in the gold and silver bullion
which has to be treated by the ordinary methods of refining, and its
presence occasions no small amount of trouble to the refiner.
    It is well known that there are two methods of rofining, both of
which involve alloying one part of gold with (about) three parts by
weight of silver, and treating the mass directly —
                          (a.) With nitric acid,
                          (6.) With sulphuric acid.
    The final result from either method, if properly conducted, is fine
 gold and fine silver — that is to say, if the alloy so treated is com
 posed of gold and silver only (a little copper present making no
 difference).
    In the case of platinum being present in the gold or the silver, if it
 is refined by the nitric acid process, the platinum, when existing in
small proportions, is eliminated with the silver, becoming dissolved
 up with it, leaving the gold free, and the platinum so dissolved can
 afterwards be readily separated from the silver, but upon the large
 scale refining by means of nitric acid is far too costly ; practically,
 therefore, this has to be replaced by the sulphuric acid process.
     In an alloy of gold and silver, containing a small proportion of
 platinum, nearly all the silver is dissolved by the sulphuric acid,
 leaving the platinum associated with the gold.
    In order to simplify matters for further treatment, this partially
 refined gold holding the platinum is melted and assayed, to deter
mine the amount of platinum and gold it contains ; it is the platinum-
gold alloys so obtained that I desire to bring under notice.
     It has been found in practice that the ordinary method of assaying
 a small portion cut from one end of a bar or ingot of such metal
 does not indicate the actual percentage of gold and of platinum exist
 ing in the entire mass, and it is therefore evident that the platinum
 has been redistributed by liquation during the cooling and solidifica
 tion of the mass.
    Having been struck by the experiments made by Professor Roberts-
 Austen, as detailed in the paper to which reference has already been
 made,   I cast some gold containing platinum into a special iron mould
 3 inches in diameter, and cut the spheres of metal so obtained in two
 halves. I may mention that I had to cast these spheres many times
 over in order to obtain a solid casting, so great was the shrinkage.

   A.  Composed     of about 880 gold to 050 platina.
   B. Composed of about 700 gold to 120 platina.
   In the one case the maximum difference between the gold per
centage is a variation of 032, viz., 887 on the outside against 883¦8
at the centre of the alloy, and in the platinum 047'5 on the outside
against 052"5 at the centre, an extreme variation of 005 is shown.
   In the other case the maximum difference between the gold per
centage is a variation of 041, viz., 732'4 on the outside, against 694-l
at the centre of the alloy, and in the platinum 122 on the outside
against 166 at the centre, an extreme variation of 044.
   Thus showing indisputably that the platinum in cooling liquates
from  the gold and becomes concentrated towards the centre      of the alloy.
   In support of these experimental results I give the actual figures
obtained from six platinum-gold ingots, taken at different times and
of different qualities, as they occurred in the course of refining com
mercially.     Each of these bars, after melting and assaying, was
separately heated with a view to extract the amount of gold con
tained. It will be at once seen that the higher percentage of gold
indicated by the assay of a portion cut from one end of the ingot is
not borne out by the actual amount of fine gold obtained by refining,
which, of course, truly represents the proportion of gold existing in
each bar.

   These results prove that the percentage of gold in the outer portion
of ingots of platinum-gold alloy does not represent the true per
centage of gold in the alloy, and that liquation does take place to an
extent which, independently of its scientific and metallurgical in
terest, has,   I  believe, been by many overlooked up to the present
time in commercial transactions with such metal.
   The results given were observed in platinum-gold alloyed with
silver, with copper, and with both silver and copper ; but, in order to
prove    whether or not such         alloy had any tendency to carry tho

platinum to the centre of the mass,      I  melted 900 parts of fine gold
with 100 parts of pure platinum, and, after repeated meltings, cast
this alloy into tbe same mould used for the experiments recorded
above.    The result was, as in the previous cases, liquation of the
platinum towards the centre of the sphere, the gold and platinum in
1000 parts being as 900 to 098 on the exterior, against 845 and 146

II.  " On the Unit of Length of a Standard Scale by Sir George
      Shuckburgh, appertaining to the Royal Society."                 By
      General J. T. Walker, R.E., F.R.S. Received February 3,
      1890.
   In the determinations of the length of the         seconds pendulum,
which were made in London by Kater and at Greenwich by Sabine,
and are described   in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' for 1818, 1829,
and 1831, the distance between the upper and lower edges of the
pendulum was measured off on a standard scale which had been con
structed by Sir George Shuckburgh.         The scale had not been com
pared   with  any  of  the  modern standard scales, but it had been
preserved with much care with the instruments appertaining to the
Royal Society.
   In the autumn of 1888, M. le Commandant Defforges, an officer of
the French Geodetic Survey, came to England to take a share in
operations   for the determination of the difference in longitude
between Greenwich and Paris, and also to determine the length of a
French seconds pendulum at Greenwich.            He kindly undertook to
comply with a suggestion which was made to him by me, to com
pare the portion of Shuckburgh's scale which had been employed by
Kater and Sabine with one of the standard metre bars of the Inter
national Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris.         The Council of
the Royal Society assented, and the scale was sent across to Paris
and brought back again by special messenger.
   The details and results of the comparison are given in the following
account by Commandant Defforges, from which it will be seen that
the scale was compared with the French metrical brass scale, N, at
 the temperature of 48'7° F., at which the distance between Kater and
 Sabine's divisions, 0 and 39'4, of the Shnckburgh scale was found
 equal to V0006245 metre. On reducing to the temperature of 62° F.,
 which was employed by Kater and Sabine, this distance becomes
 1'0007619 metre, which is equivalent to 39'400428 inches if we adopt
 the relation 1 metre = 39'370432 inches, which was determined by
 Colonel Clarke, C.B., of the Ordnance Survey, and is given in his
 valuable work on the Comparisons of Standards of Length. Thus

the actual length of the space 0 to 39'4 on the Shuckburgh scale may
be regarded with some probability as differing by not more than
about 0-0004 inch, or, say, the 100,000th part, from the quantity
which the scale indicates.

   When the conditions under which artificial digestions are usually
carried on are compared with those under which digestion takes
place in the alimentary canal, it is seen at once how imperfect the
former are in comparison with the latter. The most important
factors present in natural digestion, and wanting in the artificial, are :
1. Constant motion and mixing of the digesting mass.         2. Constant
removal of the digestive products. 3. Continuous addition of fresh
portions of digestive fluid. These factors must determine that natural
digestion is more rapid and complete than is the artificial imitation,
and my experiments were begun with a view to carrying out artificial
digestions under conditions which should supply some at least of
those which are usually wanting in such cases, but are always present
in the natural process. The apparatus employed may be described as
follows : — A stream of water is warmed by passing through a heated
copper coil, and allowed to flow through a vertical cylindrical vessel
in which is concentrically immersed a smaller cylindrical glass vessel
some 2 feet high and 4 inches in diameter.           By this means the
contents of the inner vessel can be kept constantly at a temperature
of 40° C. The lower end of the inner vessel is connected with a tube
which passes through the side of the outer vessel, so that its contents
may be drawn off and renewed whenever it may be desired to do so.
The material to be digested is placed in a     JJ -shaped loop of parch
ment-paper tubing, together with the digestive fluid, and this loop
is then allowed to hang down freely into the inner vessel, and is
 surrounded by a fluid whose composition is the same as that of the

   digestive  fluid minus the digestive ferment. This parchment dialvser
   is finally kept in constant up and down motion by means of an
  appropriate     motor, and its contents are thus continuously mixed by
  the almost
                 " peristaltic " waves which pass over the walls of the
  tube during its motion.            In this way it becomes possible to take
  advantage     of  the   diffusibility   of the digestive products, and effect
  their more or less rapid removal during any given digestion.                    It
  will be further seen that the diffused products can be collected, so
  that there is no loss of material during the digestion.            Moreover, the
  rate of removal of the products can, within certain limits, be modified
  by the frequency of changing the fluid into which their diffusive
  removal takes place.         It has not as yet been found possible to supply
  the third factor in a normal digestion, viz., the continuous addition
  of fresh digestive ferment.            Although the above apparatus is very
  efficient, as compared with the vessels in which artificial digestions
  are nsually carried on, it falls far behind the natural, and chiefly for
  two reasons.      In the first place, the removal of digestive products is
  dependent solely and entirely upon their diffusibility, whereas in the
 alimentary canal there is now no donbt that they are largely removed
 by the specific activity of the epithelial cells.           In the next place, the
  diffusive exit    of  the    products    leads to  an  influx  of fluid into the
 dialyser, which, by diluting the ferment solution, is detrimental to its
 continued initial activity.          Notwithstanding these shortcomings, the
 differences in the rate and completeness of a digestion carried on in
 this apparatus, as compared with those of one carried on under other
 wise similar conditions in a flask, are very marked, and indicate that
 its efficiency is not inconsiderable.
                                                  I
     I may now describe the experiments have made, the results I have
 obtained, and the conclusions which may be drawn from them.
                       I. — The Salivary     Digestion of Starch.
     The information we possess indicates that in the alimentary canal
starch is completely converted into sugar before absorption.                 When,
ou the other hand, starch is digested artificially with either saliva or
pancreatic ferment, the conversion into sugar is never anything other
than far from complete, and a bye-product, dextrin, is always obtained
in varying but large amounts.                My first series of experiments was
undertaken         with   a   view    to  determining the cause of the above
difference in the two cases, and to obtain, if possible, an artificial
digestion which should be as complete as the natural. It may,
perhaps, be said that, inasmuch as in the body starch is digested
chiefly, and in some animals entirely, by the pancreatic juice,
therefore any deduction from a salivary digestion is not applicable to
the pancreatic.         But this objection is of no great importance here,
                                                                         Q 2

 for the experiments deal chiefly with the factors which determine the
 activity of a ferment during digestion, and there is no reason for
 supposing that there is any fundamental difference in the circum
 stances which may modify the activities of two ferments so closely
 similar as those of the salivary gland and pancreas.        Indeed,         ifc
 seems probable that what holds good for saliva will    hold good with
 even greater force for the pancreatic ferment, since the latter is
relatively more active than the former.
    The experiments were conducted        by comparing the products
formed when portions of the same mixture of starch and saliva are
simultaneously 'digested for equal times in (i) the dialyser, (ii) a
flask. The products with which       I had to deal were dextrin and
maltose.   These     estimated in each case as follows — The dextrin

was precipitated by alcohol in excess, dried at 100°, and weighed           ;
the alcoholic filtrate from this was evaporated to dryness, the residue
taken up in water, and the sugar determined in this by rotation and
reduction, and no results were accepted in which these two methods
did not give equivalent values for the sugar in solution. The
following experiments illustrate the accuracy obtainable by these
methods.    3'412 grams of starch were placed in each of two flasks
and digested with saliva.

   The results of my numerous experiments are as follows —       :
    1.The rate of digestion, estimated by the times of relative dis
appearance of the iodine reactions,     greater in the dialyser than in
                                       is
a flask.
    2.The tendency to the development of bacteria       much less in the
                                                        is
dialyser than in a flask.
    3.The amount of starch finally converted into sugar              is
                                                                 always
greater  than in a flask, and the amount  of dextrin residue   less.
                                                                 is
   This  isshown by the following typical experiment.
   Using   a mixture of starch and saliva which contained 4'23 per
cent of starch, at the end of twenty-one hours' digestion the dialyser
contained lti-78 per cent, dextrin, the flask 36-62 per cent.    At the
end of sixty-eight hours the dialyser contained 8'48 per cent, of
dextrin, the flask 3570 per cent.

   4. When the starch is digested in very dilute solutions, the amount
changed      may be approximately,        though never quite,    as great in a
flask  as  in the dialyser.
   5. The small amount of dextrin (4-29per cent.) which may be left
in the dialyser at the end of an active and prolonged digestion justi
fies the assumption that under the more favourable conditions in the
alimentary canal the whole of the starch would be converted into sugar.
   6. There is no evidence from these experiments of the formation in
appreciable amount of any sugar other than maltose by the action of
saliva on starch.
   I am at present engaged- on a set of experiments similar to the
above, using pancreatic ferment instead of saliva, in order to justify
my application of the results obtained'w-ith the latter to the natural
process, as carried on by the former in the body.
                    II.: — The Tryptic Digestion of Proteids.
   The starting point for this series of experiments was found in the
following considerations.-        When proteids are digested by trypsin
artificially they always yield large quantities of leucin and tyrosin at
the same time as the peptones.          In. the intestine, on the other hand,
these crystalline products are not described as occurring in more than
microscopic amounts, if at all.          Their absence in natural digestion
might   be   due to  two   causes : either  (i) they are formed, but removed
as fast as they are formed ; or else (ii) they are not formed at all.
Since they arise by the further action of the trypsin on the fiist-
formed peptones, and the latter are removed very rapidly after their
formation, it was thus possible that the non-occurrence of leucin and
tyrosin in the intestine was due to the rapid removal of the material
out of which they otherwise would have arisen.            It appeared possible
to obtain some solution of the difficulties presented by a comparison
of natural with artificial digestion by comparative experiments in the
dialyser and a flask- The solution is further one of considerable
physiological importance, in view of the fact that leucin is known to
he partly converted into urea when administered to an animal, so
that the difference is one which bears upon the possible source of
some of the urea which is normally being excreted under a proteid
diet.
   The material used for the digestions was fibrin in. different con
ditions : 1. Boiled and extracted with alcohol and ether, in which
condition it is extremely difficult of digestion. 2. Simply boiled and
dried by pressure.         3. Air-dried without any preliminary boiling.
The digestive solution was in most cases prepared by dissolving
purified trypsin in 0.25 per cent. carbonate of soda with 0-5 per cent,
thymol ; in some few cases the fluid was prepared by adding Benger'a

                        "
"liquor pancreaticns        to the above solution of sodium carbonate and
  thymol.
     The results of the experiments are as follows : —
     1. The rate at which the fibrin is broken down is enormously
  greater in the dialyser than in a flask.
     2. The amount of proteid which goes into solution in a given time
  is always greater in the dialyser than in a flask.
     3. The amount of leucin and tyrosin formed in a flask is greater
  than in the dialyser, but the difference is comparatively slight.
     The third of these results made it possible that          if, as in the
 alimontary canal, the peptones could be removed nearly            as rapidly
 as they are formed, then the amount of leucin and tyrosin formed
 in the dialyser would be also very small, and might approximate
  to the traces formed in the intestine.           This is  a possibility   to
 which no experimental test can be applied, since the removal of
 peptones  is  in artificial digestions dependent simply on their diffusi-
 bility.   In the alimentary canal their removal is, without doubt,
 the result very largely of the specific activity of the epithelial
cells.    When    I   examined     the contents of the intestine during
full proteid digestion,     I   obtained evidence of  a    very considerable
formation of leucin and tyrosin, of so much, in fact, that the difference
 with respect to these substances in a natural and artificial digestion
becomes quantitative and not qualitative.         Thus, in one case where a
large dog was fed with       500  grams of lean  meat,  of which nearly the
whole was digested in the ensuing six hours,          I     obtained such   a
quantity of leucin and tyrosin from            the  contents   of the small
intestine that, after the loss due to recrystallising and the perform
ance of all the tests necessary for their thorough identification,     I  am
in possession of gram of leucin and 0.3 gram of tyrosin. Although
                   1
the above    is   the most extreme case of the formation of these
 substances with which  I     have met, still in all cases whereI    have fed
dogs with proteid, and this food has been perceptibly digested,       I  have
                                         " amounts of leucin and
obtained more than " microscopic                                      tyrosin
 from the intestine. Since there      is  no reason to suppose that active
 absorption  of  these  crystalline products has not been going on during
the whole time of their formation, their presence in some cases, iu
not inconsiderable amounts, towards the close of a digestion must
imply a large total formation during the digestion. In this way the
difficulty arising out of   a  quantitative comparison of the crystalline
end-products of    a  natural and artificial tryptic digestion received a
solution of a quite unexpected kind.
    If, as believe, my experiments thus show the formation of leucin
       I
and tyrosin in not inconsiderable quantities during proteid digestion
in the intestine, some interesting considerations arise as to the physio-
iogical significance of the same.

1890.]        Study   of Natural and Artificial Digestions.          197
    Leaving tyrosin out of account for the present, the more usual view
 has been that .any degradation of the nitrogen of proteids into the
 amide form in the alimentary canal, accompanied by the probable
 immediate conversion of the leucin into urea in the liver, and its
 direct excretion as urea, implies a waste of energy which is improbable
 on teleological grounds.     And this view is supported by the state
 ments as to the absence of leucin (and tyrosin) from the alimentary
 canal. Now, however, we have to deal with the fact that these amid-
 ated acids are formed during proteid digestion. There are two possible
 ways in which their formation may be of importance to the animal
 economy. Although at first sight the conversion of part of the
 proteid into leucin and its speedy elimination as urea seems to imply
a waste of energy to the body, it is not improbable, as Foster has
 suggested, that this may be of real use to the economy.       We know
 that in artificial digestions the amount, nature, and digestibility of a
 proteid, and the activity of tho ferment which acts upon      it,  deter
 mine to some extent the course and. results of the digestion. These
factors will probably make themselves still more felt in a natural
 digestion in the body. Thus leucin may make its appearance to very
varying extents at different times in the same animal, and so provide
a  sort of safety valve to the organism by diverting from the tissues
 what would otherwise frequently be an unnecessarily large burden of
 proteid metabolism.     A second view one which opens up the whole
                                       is
question of the physiological significance of the amides in the animal
economy.      It known that the amides play an all-important part in
               is
the nitrogenous metabolism of plants. Leucin and tyrosin occur
widely spread in many of the tissues and fluids of animals. In many
deranged conditions, notably of the liver, these substances occur in
largely increased amounts, so that a discharge of them takes place
from the body. It     is thus possible that normally their occurrence in
smaller amounts      is due to the fact that in the healthy organism
they   are being continually used up in the chemical cycle of tissue
metabolism. Thus the real significance of their formation during
digestion may well be for the supply of new amidated compounds, to
take the place of those portions which must be always becoming
useless for further metabolic processes by continual wear and tear.
Examined in the light of all the facts which can be brought to bear
upon   it, thereis   much evidence in support of this view. It is,
however, incompatible with the requirements of a preliminary com
munication to enter fully here into   a   discussion and application of
this evidence.

      M.B., B.Sc. Communicated by T. Lauder Brunton, M.D.,
      F.R.S. Received February 13, 1890.
   During the months of March and April, 1889, I analysed for
Dr. Lauder Brunton, and under his direction, a number of speci
mens of urine containing cystin.         The estimation of the amonnt of
this substance present in the samples examined was carried out by
Lobisch's process, and revealed certain variations 'which were of
interest as connecting the elimination of cystin with the processes
of digestion.    In carrying out this work, I was struck with the fact
that the amount of cystin precipitated from the same specimen was
greater under certain circumstances than under others.                    Thus,
(1)   when  specimens   were   strongly  acidified  with acetic acid, as recom
mended by LObisch, the precipitation took place more slowly than
if the specimens were allowed to undergo a spontaneous acid fermen
tation (which never caused the reaction to become very strongly acid).
 (2.) When the fluids were carefully filtered, the precipitation of
cystin was delayed, often for several days. (3.) When a specimen in
which cystin had begun to separate was carefully filtered, the precipi
tation was interrupted for several days.            (4.) When portions of a
urine which    was  proved by    collateral  experiments to contain cystin
were kept at a temperature of 60° C., no cystin could be separated
afterwards by the usual processes.         (5.) Evaporation did not seem to
increase materially the amount of cystin obtainable from a given
 specimen.    (6.) The largest amounts of cystin could be obtained by
allowing the specimens to stand at the ordinary temperature for several
days, provided the precipitate was separated whilst the urine was still
acid. (7.) A similar amount of cystin could be obtained more rapidly
by keeping the fluid at a temperature of less than 40° C. for twenty -four
to thirty-six hours.      (8.) When a drop of urine from which cystin
was being deposited, and which contained a large number of bacteria
and torulae, was added to a carefully filtered portion of the same urine,
a deposit of cystin occurred in the filtrate thus inoculated in twenty-
four hours, the urine becoming at the same time full of bacteria and
torulse, while another portion of the same filtrate not inoculated de
posited no cystin for ninety-six hours.          I venture to suggest as the
most probable explanation of the above results —
   (1.) That the simple addition of an acid in which cystin is not
soluble is not sufficient to separate cystin from the urine, and, there
fore, that the theory generally held as to the slate of combination of
cystin in the urine is probably inaccurate.

    (2.) That a compound exists in certain urines which under the in
fluence of a fermentation yields cystin.
    (3.) That the fermentation is due to the growth of an organism,
which can apparently be separated from the urine by ordinary filtra
tion, and must therefore be a large organism, possibly a torula.
    (4.) That the cases recorded in which cystin has been found de
posited in the kidneys and liver indicate that the fermentation may
begin    in the system.

    The stages described are (i) newly-hatched or early larval ; (ii)
 early post-larval ; (iii) -£-inch long ; (iv) f-inch long.
    The development of the pineal region is treated separately, and in
 this a fifth stage — lT*f-inch long — is introduced.
    In the early larval stage the downward flexure of the fore part of
the brain is very noticeable. It appears due to the general conforma
tion of head at this stage. The cerebral lobes are short ; the anterior
 commissure is well marked.            The white matter of the cerebrum is
 divided into two patches on each side, from the most ventral of
 which the short stout olfactory nerves pass to the bases of the nasal
 sacs, now closely opposed to the cerebrum. The roof of the cerebrum
 is very thin, passing into the thicker roof of the thalamencephalon.
 The tips of the optic thalami are wholly vesicular.                A diverticulum
 of the 3rd ventricle extends downwards and backwards, its distal
 extremity underlying the optic commissure. The broad ventral com
missure of the infundibulum, noticed in Anarrhicas* is well marked.
A commissure shuts off the lumen of the infundibulum from the
 hind part of the 3rd ventricle immediately in front of the splitting
 off of the infundibnlum.          The optic ventricles do not appear in the
front part of the mid-brain, and are only partially developed further
back. The tori semicirculares are present in the hind part of the
mid-brain as mounds on either side of the central fissure of the
cerebral mass.        The valvula appears in transverse section as a pair
of ridges externally to the tori, before it shuts off the aqueduct of
 Sylvius.      The cerebellar fold is very short ; the pituitary body is a
 roundish mass of deeply staining cells, opposed ventrally to the
 membranous roof of the mouth, and clasped in front and at the sides

  except  for a  fine   cellular    membrane.        Behind the body is seen the
 tapering, downwardly-bent anterior end of the notochord.
     In the early post-larval stage * " an apparent rectification of the
  cranial axis " has taken place, by the upward rotation of the cere
 brum on its posterior end, doubtless owing to the rapid development
 of the oral and trabecular cartilages, and consequent forward rotation
  of the month.        The same causes have also operated so as to with
 draw the diverticulum of the 3rd ventricle from its position below
 the optic commissure.           Changes are noticed in the arrangement of
 the nervous tissues.          The olfactory nerves are longer, and the nasal
  sacs further from the brain. The fibrous bridge over the 3rd ventricle
  (behind the pineal body), terminating with the posterior commissure,
  is well marked. The tips of the tectum lobi optici are seen above it.
  The bases of the optic thalami (walk of the thalamencephalon) have
 increased in breadth.         The mid-brain is comparatively large, and the
 optic ventricles     much      more advanced.         The cerebellar fold rapidly
 thins out in the middle, assuming the form, in transverse section, of
 thick lateral elements united by a cellular band.               The infundibulum
 has undergone        vertical flattening.       The future lobi inferiores are
 indicated as lateral expansions, behind which the 3rd oculomotor
 nerves pass outwards from the centre of the ventral surface of the
 cerebral mass. The infnndibulum extends some way back above the
 notochord as a thin- walled sac.          Its walls are little plicated compared,
 with those in some other forms, e.g., Rhombus,^ Anarrhicas.%
    In  the -|-inch stage the olfactory lobes appear as bulbous masses
 projecting from the front end of the cerebrum.               Fibres can be traced
 from the optic nerves up to the fore part of the optic lobes.               A pale
 median septum appears between the anterior extremities of the
lateral optic ventricles, its base resting on the fibrous tract over the
hind part of the 3rd ventricle.             The tip of the valvnla now appears
in transverse section before its connexion with the cerebral mass
can be made out, having thus grown forward.                    The cerebellum has
greatly increased in size : instead of terminating as before on the
surface of the brain, it is now continued into A thick fold bent
sharply down on the anterior portion ; its posterior end passes at
once into the thin roof of the 4th ventricle.               Two fibrous bands cross
over the aqueduct of Sylvius in the substance of the cerebellum ; their
lateral extremities are fused.           The lobi inferiores are better marked
than in earlier stages.         Longitudinal bands of fibres pass back from
the roots of the oculomotor nerves through the medulla oblongata.
Groups of large ganglionic cells appear on either side of these bands,

  and are connected by a fine commissure passing through both bands.
 At the origin of the   VIII  auditory nerves, this commissure is replaced
 by a St. Andrew's cross of fibres, the dorsal limbs of the cross passing
 to the nerve roots, and the ventral to the ganglionic areas.
    In the f-inch stage the olfactory lobes are more elongated. The
 olfactory nerves pass outwards from their anterior extremities. The
 septum behind the pineal body is larger, and contains a few very
 large cells.   The septum, after losing its ventral connexion with the
 fibrous tract over the 3rd ventricle, persists for some way back as a
 cellular leaf-like appendage of the thin median roof of the optic
 ventricle ; a few fibres pass back into this appendage.
    The optic nerves are longer, from the outward displacement of the
 eyes.    They are very stout and solid, and from their roots fibres may
 be very easily traced into the optic lobes.       Fibres are seen passing
 from the cerebral mass across the optic ventricle, external to the tori,
 to the tectum lobi opti'ci.
    The flattening of the brain, noticed by Mcintosh and Prince in the
 herring of „%¦ inch, is intensified at this stage, and the brain is also
 much elongated.
    Large ganglionic cells appear in the tori semicirculares about the
 region of the splitting off of the infundibulum.      The white matter of
 the tectum lobi optici is very conspicuous, and shows traces of three
 cellular layers in its substance. A circular pale area appears amongst
 the vesicular matter on either side of the valvula.         The lobi pos-
 teriores are present.    Behind them the walls of the medulla approach
 each other dorsally, shutting off the central canal from the 4th ventricle.
 The walls recede again further back before finally closing opposite
 the last trace of the auditory capsule.
    From behind the region of the auditory nerves a ganglionic area
 on either side persists backwards through the medulla oblongata.
 The cerebellum has increased in bulk ; its anterior dorsal angle is
carried forward.       The fibrous bands previously noticed are carried
 further back, and now lie clear of the optic lobes.         Three smaller
fibrous bands occur behind them.         In the herring of lTjj inch the
two first fibrous bands are fused together.
                               Pineal Region.
    The roof of the thalamencephalon in the early stages is a single
layer of large columnar cells passing forward from the front wall of
the pineal stalk.     It passes into the roof of the cerebrum, the cells
diminishing greatly in size.       The superior commissure of Osborn is
present from the early post-larval stage ; it is also present in the
larval and post-larval Zoarces viviparus, where it is distinctly double.
The first signs of the infrapineal recess of Hoffmann are seen in the

 5-inch stage.     It is thns much later in developing than in Salmo ;*
 and the fold forming its front wall never extends backwards to the
 same degree as in that form and in Anarrhicas.                      This fold, in the
 post-larval Zoarces,    is  thickened     in  its apex,   and    lodges a fine com
  missure. As pointed out by Balfour in Elasmobranchs the fold is due
  to the upward rotation of the cerebrum.
     The fibrous tract over the 3rd ventricle in the herring is well
 marked in the f-inch stage.           It is seen to consist of fibres passing
 upwards     and inwards    from   the  optic thalami to the middle line above
 the 3rd ventricle, and then running forward to the stalk of the pineal
 body.     The tract has a double nature, as is readily seen in vertical
 longitudinal sections of a herring ly'j inch long.                 It is seen here to
 be a backwardly     directed    fold  of  the   brain   roof, continuous ventrally
 with the back wall of the pineal stalk, and dorsally with the roof of
 the optic ventriclei the apex of the fold being the posterior commis
 sure.    Its length in this form is due to the flattening of the brain,
 the tract being very short in Zoarces, where the brain is not flattened.
  In Zoarces, also, from the same cause, the limbs- of the fold are less
 closely applied to each other and much thicker.
     The pineal body is roundish and solid in the early larval stage in
 the herring.     It is vertically flattened in the early post-larval stage.
 In the 5-inch stage it is much larger and contains a lumen ; it shows
 signs of constriction into proximal and distal elements, and the lumen
 contains a coagulable_albuminous            fluid, as in. Petromyzon.\ In the
 lT^-inch stage the constriction is still visible, and the walls are
 generally crenated.        The tissues of the pineal wall are now divided
 into three layers, and are of varying thickness. The cartilage of the
tegumen cranii overlies the body at this stage.                  The constriction of
 the body appears to be an exaggeration of the crenation of the pineal
wall met with in Salmo; it has not,, probably, the morphological
value of the constriction of the body in Petromyzon.

1890.]                 A    Cyanogen     Reaction  of Proteids.                 203
    G. Wiedemann* discovered            that on adding an alkaline solution of
copper sulphate to cyanuric acid, a violet solution was produced.
The same investigation showed that biuret- gave a rose-red solution
on treatment with copper sulphate and sodium hydrate.
   One of the ordinary tests for a proteid, which is sometimes called
Piotrowski's reaction, is the violet solution produced by adding
copper sulphate and caustic potash or soda. Albumoses and peptones
differ from other proteids in giving with these reagents a rose-red
instead of a violet solution ; the colour so produced is the same as
that given by biuret, hence this reaction is generally spoken of as
the biuret reaction.           It is stated that after heating any proteid
with caustic soda, and then adding copper sulphate, the rose-red
coloration of the biuret reaction appears ; and this is undoubtedly,
the case, for the action of the hot concentrated alkali is to form not
only alkali-albumin, but also some substances of the albumose class.
The whole value of the test in distinguishing between native albu
mins on the one hand, and peptones and albumoses on the other,
depends on its being performed in the cold.
   Briickef especially has emphasised the difference between the
violet coloration given by ordinary proteids and the rose-red (so-called
biuret) reaction of the peptones.               He however considers that the
radicle in the complex proteid molecule which gives rise to the reac
tion is probably the same in both cases, but that it is some other
change in the molecule that causes the difference of tint.
   SalkowskiJ has recently investigated the colour reactions of the
proteids, and shown that Millon's reaction and the Adamkiewicz
reaction are produced by the presence in the proteid molecule of
certain aromatic radicles.           He does not, however, appear to have
investigated the biuret reaction ; and the object of my own work has
been to discover, if possible, upon what groups of atoms in the proteid
molecule this reaction depends.              Whether the violet colour of ordi
nary    proteids    is  due   to  cyanuric    acid, and the rose-red colour of
peptones to biuret,      I  am, however, unable to say.       The main result of
my experiments        has  been  that   these  reactions depend on the presence
in a proteid of cyanogen, or of some cyanogen-containing radicle.                  I
have also, by means of somewhat modifying the method usually
adopted for performing the test, discovered that it may be used for
distinguishing classes of proteids from one another more accurately
than has hitherto been possible.
    The chief modification       I have introduced into the test has been the
addition of ammonia, either instead of or in addition to the potash or

soda usually employed.            In some cases I have added each reagent
separately,     first  copper sulphate, then ammonia, and then potash or
soda ; but, as a rule, I have employed a reagent made by dissolving
a copper salt in ammonia ; the dark blue solution that results is an
ammoniacal solution of cupric hydroxide.                   After adding this to a
solution of proteid and observing the result, potash or soda can be
added subsequently.            The use of the ammoniacal solution of cupric
hydroxide as a reagent for detecting proteids was first suggested to
me by the fact that on adding some of it to urine from a case of
cystitis    I  obtained a reddish-violet colour.             In the light of subse
quent experiments,        it is probable    that   this urine   contained a peptone
or peptone-like substance derived from the decomposition of pus
corpuscles.
   The reactions        I obtained with various proteids may be thus tabu
lated   :—

   Native albumins differ from the products of proteolysis (albumoses
and peptones) by giving no change of colour with an ammoniacal
solution of cupric hydroxide ; when potash or soda is subsequently
added, the result is, as usual, a violet solution.               The albumoses and
peptones,     on  the  other   hand,  give  a violet   solution  with the ammonia
cal oupric hydroxide ; this is turned red on the subsequent addition of
potash or soda.
    Copper sulphate and ammonia added separately give the same
results.      When a drop of copper sulphate solution is added to a
proteid solution, the result is a precipitate of an albuminate of
copper ;* on adding ammonia, this dissolves up ; if the solution is
 blue, changing to violet when potash is added, albumoses and pep
tones are absent ; but if the solution is violet, changing to red when
 potash is added, albumoses or peptones, or both, are present.
   • This preliminary precipitation    does not, however, occur with deutero-olbumose
nor with pure peptone.

  This method of performing the test has a great advantage over the
way in which it is usually done, as it is much easier to distinguish
between the hlue of the dissolved cuprio hydroxide and the violet due
to peptone when ammonia is added than it is between                    the violet
solution     given by albumin and the rose-red given by peptones
when potash is added, especially if the solutions be dilute.             The test
with ammonia has also this advantage, that peptones and albumoses
can be detected with certainty even if other proteids are present at
the same time.

solved in ammonia ; the solution so formed is a purplish one, and

   This test may thus be used for distinguishing between albumins
and the products of proteolytic digestion ; the former giving a yellow
solution only after the addition of potash or soda, the latter giving a
yellow colour with nickel oxide and ammonia alone, which is however
deepened to a dull orange by the addition of potash or soda.
   I  next proceeded to apply these tests to other classes of proteids,
albuminates, globulins, fibrin, coagulated proteid, and mucin ; and
the results are stated in the following table : —

1890.]                    A   Cyanogen         Reaction   of Proteids.                   207
    Coagulated        proteid behaves like the peptones;                  this ¦ is easily
explicable, as Neumeister* has shown that the action of hot water on
proteids forms from them small quantities of albumoses due to
hydration.        The other proteids in the above list behave like the
albumins, and thus differ from the albumoses and peptones.
    I now pass from the proteids to certain derivatives of proteids,
these experiments being designed to elucidate the question as to what
radicle it is on the proteid molecule to which these reactions are
due.
     Uric Acid — Uric acid was dissolved in soda and boiled ; then
cooled, and a drop of copper sulphate added; this did not colour the
fluid at all ; on adding more, a violet solution was obtained. f
    Uric acid dissolved in soda, but not heated, gave with cupric
hydroxide in ammonia a pink colour.
    A little uric acid was evaporated to dryness on a porcelain dish
with nitric acid ; on adding cupric hydroxide in ammonia to this a
violet colour is obtained ; this is not simply the murexide test pro
duced by the ammonia, as nickel oxide dissolved in ammonia gives a
deep yellow colour.            Thus uric acid gives the reactions very much as
proteids do.
     Xanthine,    hypoxanthine, and sarwsine give the same reactions.
     Biuret and cyannric acid arc the substances in which the colour
tests    with cupric hydroxide in alkaline solutions were first observed                     ;
 the   following are the particulars of the experiments have performed  I

    Biuret thus behaves in very much, but not exactly, the same way
as peptones ;    while cyanuric acid gives the same colour reactions as
albumin.
    Hydrocyanic Acid. — The same series of reactions was tried with
this substance, and the result was that the colours obtained were
precisely the same as those obtained with peptones and albumosea.
The details are as follows : —
                       Addition of                         Produced
    Cupric sulphate                                   No effect.
    Cupric sulphate and potash                         Rose-red solution.
    Cupric sulphate and ammonia, or ammoniacal
       solution of cupric hydroxide                    Violet solution.
    Subsequent addition of potash or soda              Rose-red solution.
    Nickel sulphate dissolved in ammonia               Yellow solution.
    Subsequent addition of potash or soda              Orange solution.
    The colours produced are in some cases evanescent, and, if any free
 acid is left, not neutralised by the ammonia or potash added, the
 liquid remains colourless.
    Glycocine, Leucine,      Tyrosine. — These substances    gave negative
 results, the liquid remaining blue or bluish-green throughout.
    Ethyl aldehyde, propyl aldehyde, valeraldehyde, isobutyl aldehyde, and
  benzyl aldehyde similarly gave entirely negative results.
                              General Conclusions.
    The    addition   of   cupric   sulphate  and  potash   to albumin or
 globulin produces       a violet   solution.  The addition    of the same
 reagents to peptones or albumoses causes a rose-red solution.            If
 ammonia be added as well the results are as follows : — Cupric
 sulphate and ammonia added to albumin causes a blue solution,
 turned violet on the addition of potash ; cupric sulphate and ammonia
 added to peptone or albumose gives a violet solution, turned red on
 the addition of potash.
     By this reaction, and by a somewhat similar reaction in which
  nickel sulphate is used, peptones and albumoses may be easily dis
 tinguished from, and detected in the presence of, albumins and
 globulins.
     Not only proteids, but other organic substances ultimately obtain
  able from proteids, give very similar reactions.
     The reaction is not given by the amido-acids, glycocine, and
  leucine ; nor by derivatives, like tyrosine and benzyl aldehyde, that
 contain an aromatic nucleus, nor by the aldehydes of various alcohols.
 But in the substances that do give the test, the nitrogen is either
 partly or wholly combined in the form of cyanogen : these substances
 are biuret, cyanuric acid, uric acid, xanthine, hypoxanthine, sarco-

  sine, and hydrocyanic acid.        It thus appears probable that the colour
  reaction    of the   proteids that  occurs on addition of a cupric salt and
  an alkali is due to the existence in the proteid also of cyanogen.
      Just as some proteids give a rose-red colour, and others a violet, so,
  in the list of substances just enumerated, some give a rose-red, and
  some a violet.       Biuret was the substance in which a rose-red colour
  was first noted    ;  hence the term biuret reaction, as applied to peptones.
  Cyanuric      acid was the substance in which a violet colour was first
  noted.     Probably in both cases the reaction is due to a cyanogen
  radicle ; but the cause of the difference in colour is unknown. In the
  same way, our ignorance of the constitution of the proteid molecule
  stands in the way of our discovering the difference between peptones
  that give a rose-red colour and albumins that give a violet colour.
       The term biuret reaction is to some extent a misuomer, as applied
   to the peptones and albumoses ; the test with the modification         I have
   introduced behaves a little differently in the two cases.      The substance
'
   that peptone most nearly resembles in its colour reactions is hydro
   cyanic acid, as is shown in the table (p. 209), in which a contrast is
   drawn between the chief substances which I have examined.
       Using the word cyanogen in the widest possible sense, the con
   clusion I should draw from such a series of experiments is that the
   colour reaction with a cupric salt and an alkali is a cyanogen
   reaction. Among the simpler organic bodies examined, wo have
    certain cyanogen compounds, like cyanuric acid, that give a violet
    colour ; and certain proteids (the albumins and globulins) give the
    same colour.       There are certain other substances, like biuret, which
    give a red colour without any intermediate violet stage; there are
    others, like hydrocyanic acid, which give a violet colour with
    ammonia, which is turned red by potash or soda; and to this last
    group the peptones also belong.       Just as there is a different combina
    tion of the cyanogen in cyanuric acid from that in hydrocyanic acid,
    so there is probably the same difference between the combination of
     the cyanogen in albumin and peptone respectively ; and this difference
    is, as a rule, brought about by a digestive ferment.

                                  (Abstract.)
    Pointing   out the intimate relations between the stndy of plant
 physiology and pathology, the lecturer briefly referred to the existing
 modes of classifying the diseases of plants, and the difficulties they
involve.     Broadly speaking, there are diseases due to soil, climate, and
 the influence of the non-living environment on the one hand ; and
 those due to the attacks of living organisms (parasitic fungi, insects.
 4c.) on the other.     Some interesting cases were briefly discussed, and
 the fact brought out that several causal factors co-operate in pro
 ducing any disease.
    With regard to fungus diseases, there are especial complexities,
 because we have to learn (1) the life history of the fungus, and
 (2) understand the biology of the host-plant, and this means we must
 (3) also discover what influences in each case are exerted by the
 variations   of the environment (heat, light, moisture, &c.) in each
 case.    Even then there is an unknown variable (4) in the internal
 changes going on in both the host and the parasite.
    After reviewing, with the aid of illustrations and experiments,
 some of the principal functions of the normal tissues of a green plant,
 the effects of variations in temperature, intensity of light, amount of
 water in the air, <tc., were discussed.    The chief points are that under
 certain conditions, e.g., a low temperature,      feeble light, and when
 the atmosphere is saturated with        moisture,   the plant may be less
 able to withstand the iuroads of a parasite, because its protective
  cell-walls are thinner and more watery, its cell sap abounds in sub

 214     Prof. H. Marshall Ward.       The Relations between       [Feb. 27,
  stances   like glucose, acids, and soluble nitrogenous matters, the
  protoplasm lining each cell is less capable of destroying substances
 which can injure ic — its respiratory processes being enfeebled — and,
 in short, such a plant approaches the condition of a very young
 seedling, or a plant growing in the dark.
     Experiments have proved that such plants not only offer less resist
 ance to the hypha of a parasite, but the very conditions which cause
 the plant to abound in materials suitable to the fungus also suit the
 fangus itself.
     Attention was then called to a peculiar parasitic disease, very
 common in green-houses, gardens, &c., in this country and elsewhere,
 and some cuttings of geraniums which had been wholly or partially
 destroyed by it were exhibited.     One curious fact is, that this fungus
 causes a sort of rotten-ripeness of grapes on the Rhine, and that these
 mouldy grapes are those which are used to produce the finest wines
in some of the districts : the explanation is that the diseased grapes
undergo remarkable changes, by which the proportion of acid is
reduced, and the must of the grapes rendered richer. But although
 in this case we utilise the effects of the disease-producing fungus, in
 other cases these fungi cause epidemic diseases of clover, rape, hemp,
 onions, hyacinths, and other plants.
    The symptoms and progress of these diseases were described, the
 chief points being illustrated by lantern slides and actual specimens,
 of which there was a collection on the tables.
     The fungus attacks the plant by destroying first its cell- walls, and
 then its protoplasm, cell by cell : this it effects by excreting a series
 of ferments or poisons.       When it has destroyed the tissues, the
 fungus proceeds to extend more rapidly, and the destruction quickly
 advances.      The fungus is as it were in the position of an attacking
 army, its weapons being these soluble ¦ferments, or poisons, capable of
 dissolving the cell-walls and killing the living protoplasm in the
 cells.
     The tissues of the host-plant, again, are in the position of a besieged
 army ; the real fighting force being the protoplasm.            The proto
 plasm is entrenched, so to speak, behind the cellulose cell-walls, and
 it has in its interior stores or reserves of food-materials which may
 be in a well replenished condition or the reverse.     The hyphae of the
 fungus overcome the cell-walls or      out-works,  by dissolving them by
 means of soluble ferments, and it will be intelligible that the thick
 ness and solidity of these cell- walls are important in the matter ;
 thin, soft, watery cell-walls being more easily penetrated.
     Once inside the walls, the fungus-hypha is face to face with the
real fighting contingent, however, the protoplasm ; and the fact was
insisted upon that circumstances affect the power of this protoplasm
to cope with the poison which the hyphae pour into it. So long as the

 1890.]    Host and Parasite in certain Diseases of Plants.             215
protoplasm can dispose of the small amounts of poison coming in
from the hypliae, by respiratory oxidation or otherwise, the hypha is
debarred access to the cells, but immediately the poison succeeds in
lessening or destroying the power of the protoplasm to control the
cell-sap, the latter exudes through the permeable protoplasm, and
suffuses the whole tissues with acid sap, containing just such food-
materials as the fungus flourishes in.             Consequently the latter
spreads quickly, killing    the   cells more   rapidly than ever, and soon
destroying large tracts of tissue.        This killed tissue turns brown,
and we can consequently trace the progress of the disease by the
spread of the discoloration.      It was shown that the destructive power
of the fungus concerned    —  i.e., the capability of its hyphae to produce
the poisons — can be enhanced by culture in solutions of sugar, organic
acids, and a little nitrogenous material and salts —just such a solution
as is obtained in infusions of dead vegetable tissues ; consequently
the destructive power of the parasite increases as it feeds on the pro
ceeds of destruction.
   It has recently been discovered that the successive crops of spores
of the fungus differ in infective power, and that, whereas the spores
first formed may be unable to infect a living plant, those of the second
or third generation can do so.
   In conclusion, and passing over the observations and references
to other diseases, there are four chief points to be considered in
regard to the epidemic fungus-diseases concerned.
   First, there is the healthy host-plant itself, which may be a more
or less favourable object for the fungus.           Secondly, there is the
fungus, which may, or may not be, able to kill the living cells of the
host.    Thirdly, the influence of variations in the environment —
especially low temperatures, want of light, and damp air — may so
affect the host-plant that it is more easily and quickly infected by the
fungus than was the case when its cell-walls were thicker and harder,
and its protoplasm more capable of effecting certain processes of
metabolism,    and controlling     the  sap  in the cells.    Fourthly, the
fungus also is capable of being rendered more formidable by varia
tions in its environment, and especially by invigorating culture in
suitable food materials.
   Now when the external conditions are such that they favour the
development of the fungus, while at the same time lowering the
metabolic activity and respiratory power of the protoplasm, the
conditions for an epidemic of the disease in question exist, and
this is frequently realised in a dull, cold, wet July or August in
this country. The point especially insisted on is not that any
mysterious predisposition to disease is here manifest, but that the
one plant — the fungus— is favoured by the prevailing conditions of
culture more than the other— the host-plant. If we wanted to culti

vate the fungus in one green-house and the host in another, each by
itself, we should endeavour to provide the one set of conditions for
the fungus, and another and very different set for the host.

       Assistant to the Professor of Civil Engineering, Trinity
       College, Dublin. Communicated by Professor Fitzgerald,

       December        19, 1889.
                                     [Plates    6, 7.]
    In two    papers     read  before    the  Royal Society,* some three years
ago,    I  described     a "Method of Condensation" in calorimetry.               A
number of experiments in support of the reliability of the new
method are contained in those papers, as well as a description of such
forms of apparatus as            I  had then been using.              The apparatus,
 however, could not be said to be the result of a very prolonged
 study of the capabilities of the method, and possessed many defects,
 chiefly on the score of convenience in effecting the measurements.
A continued use of the method since that time and its application to
some exacting measurements have led to various alterations in the
apparatus, so that, after many reconstructions, entirely new forms
have been conferred on the instrument.                   I  purpose to describe two
 new forms : a single calorimeter similar in type to the older instru
 ment, but differing in construction ; and a differential calorimeter,
 rendering possible measurements which could hardly be effected in
 the single type of instrument.
     In the interval, too, a wider knowledge of the capabilities of the
 method has been acquired. Its errors have been enquired into.                    On
 the question of the errors arising from radiation many hundreds of
 experiments have been made. The general results of these will be
 found in the following pages. Again,               I  have from time to time tabu
 lated    such   data as are of use         in the applications of this calori-
 metrical method.         These I ask permission to include, so as to render
 this account of the method as complete as it can, within convenient
 bounds, be made.          As, however, descriptions of the principles of the
 method, and of many experimental tests to which it has been sub
 jected, are accessible both in Professor Bunsen's paperf on the

                              (as lie has designated it) and in my own
papers (loc. cit.), I will   go over this old ground only so far as to be
intelligible     to those who have not seen those papers.
   Theory    of    the   Method.       — The theory of
                                             the method is, briefly, as
follows : — A substance at the temperature,      of the air brought into
                                                             t\,
an atmosphere of saturated steam will, in attaining the temperature,
/», of the latter, condense   certain weight of steam, to, such that w\
                                       a
where   X    the latent heat of vapour of water, represents a quantity
            is
of heat equal to the calorific capacity of the substance between tho
limits of temperature.      Hence,     be the specific heat of the body,
                                                if   S
W its weight,
                                         w\ =WS      (V-O                          (!)
From this      Sdeduced by measuring w, U°, t°, W, and knowing tho
                   is
value of \ from recorded experiments.
   The apparatus required      one permitting the sudden admission of
                                         is
steam  around  the substance,  and subsequently the accurate observa
tion of the weight of water precipitated upon it.
   The steam calorimeter       on the lines of
                                         is     slight metal receptacle,
                                                             a
placed beneath a delicate balance, so that a wire depending from one
arm of the balance sustains        light wire platform within the re
                                               a
ceptacle or calorimeter.      The platform is provided with a little
platinum-foil catchwater beneath it. The substance to be dealt with
is placed upon the platform.     Steam being admitted into the calori
meter, the substance rapidly rises to its temperature,       condensing
steam, which adhering as water to its surface, or dropping into the
catchwater beneath,      estimated without loss by the balance.
                                 is                                   In
this way  the value of w    determined isin the equation for the specific
heat.
     The observation of          t,°   is   effected by a thermometer left in company
with the substance in the calorimeter                    asufficient length of time and
read just before admitting steam. The temperature of the steam, tt°,
is deduced by inserting a thermometer in the calorimeter when     is               it
filled with steam or by observation of the height of the barometer.
In the thermometry        sufficient in order to secure a high degree of
                               it   is
accuracy to read the second place of decimals by estimation, the ther
mometers having a fairly open scale divided to tenths of degrees.
The range obtaining       so considerable that one tenth of
                                 is                            degree       a           is
a small fraction of the whole.

   The Latent Heat of Steam. — The value of X, the latent heat of
steam, may be taken for rough experiments as 536'5, its value at
760 mm. pressure. In accurate work its variability with the baro
metric height is, however, not negligible.                 Following Professor
Bunsen, and in a great measure quoting from his paper, I subjoin
a table containing the value of X and the boiling point of water at
different heights of the barometer.            The values of X are calculated on
Regnault's    formula     for the  total  heat  of steam : —
                 Q = 606-5-0-695i-0-00002<3-0-0000003J3.

     The Density of Steam and Correction for Displacement.

considerable        deduction from the increase of weight indicated by
the balance.         It is to be remembered that the density of steam at
100° C. is about half that of air at 10°C.                 The effect on the apparent
weight     of  the   substance    will    in  fact  be  observable    even if it displace
a volume of but one cubic centimetre, and the deduction becomes
very necessary when dealing with bulky substances.
   The following table contains the density of saturated steam over
the range of barometric variation.                 It is calculated from the formula
of Zeuner,*

    The results obained          from this formula and embodied in the table
 agree well with deductions based on Regnault's experiments                         on the
 total heat of steam.           The rate of variation with rise of temperature
 is closely represented by the formula, but it is noteworthy that the
 values themselves depart somewhat from Fairbairn's and Tate's expe
 rimentally found values.f Thus, according to the latter observers,
 the density at 100° is 0¦0006187.                  Now, although in general a small
 error in those values is not of great import — an error of as much as
 5 per cent, would most generally have an inappreciable effect on the
 estimation of w — yet cases may arise when a close value is desirable.
     In the hopes of deciding between the various values assigned to
 the density of steam, I made some direct experiments in the calori
 meter.       These, in fact, became necessary in the course of some early
 experiments on the specific heat of air at constant volume, when the
 displacement difference of a spherical copper vessel having a volume
 of about 164 c.c. had to be considered.                     Although the experiments
 are not as concordant as could be desired, their object is, I think,
 sufficiently attained. I, therefore, add a short account of them here,

   The procedure adopted was the obvious one of measuring directly
the effect of the displacement difference, air to steam, on tho weight
of the copper sphere ; condensation of the steam upon it being pre
vented by raising it to a temperature above that of the steam before
the vapour was admitted into the calorimeter.           The calorimeter used
was spherical, and 14 cm. in diameter.            The sphere was first equili
brated   when   cold  as  it  hung   in the calorimeter, the air in the calori
meter being to a great extent dried by leaving in it a vessel of calcium
chloride throughout the previous night. In considering, then, the
density of tho air in which equilibration was effected, the hygrometric
state of the air need not be taken into account.            At this point the
temperature of the air in the calorimeter and the height of the
barometer were observed.            Steam was now got np in the boiler
attached to the calorimeter, the calorimeter opened, the calcium
chloride removed, and the process of heating the sphere begun.
   This consisted in applying to it a spirit flame as it was slowly
swung round on the suspending wire. Of course the first effect of
the flame is to precipitate moisture on the cold metal, but as this
grows hot the moisture drys off. To avoid as far as possible a change
of weight during this process, duo to oxidation, the precaution had
been taken of subjecting the sphere to a prolonged course of similar
treatment previously, till further heating over a reasonable interval
of time had no appreciable effect on its weight.
   When tho temperature of the sphere all over is well above that of
the steam, shown by touching it here and there with a stirring-rod
wet with water, steam is admitted into the calorimeter.
   It is observable that if now, immediately tho calorimeter is filled
with steam, the counterpoise be adjusted till equilibrium obtains, this
counterpoise will be excessive.          The steam is superheated in the
vicinity   of the  copper     sphere,  and  its density diminished below its
true density at the prevailing pressure.             In a few moments the
apparent weight      of  the    sphere  diminishes.    The change may be as
much as a milligram.           The vibrations of the balance now become
steady, and     this  state    of  equilibrium continues for from 10 to
14 minutes.      The quantity by which the counterpoise has been in
creased to maintain this equilibrium is the true result of the experi
ment.     Subsequently a slow and uniform increase in the apparent
weight of the sphere takes place, at the rate of 1 milligram in five
minutes. This effect, which is considered further on, is apparentlv
due to radiation, and consequent slow continued precipitation of
water in the sphere.        It doeH not apparently interfere with the ex
periment. When the experiment is concluded, I found it necessary
sometimes to make a second observation of the height of the
barometer.
   To reduce the experiment the following values are required          : —

                                   On   the Steam     Calorimeter.                  225
  On comparing1 the result deduced as the mean of theae eight obser
vations with the value tabulated opposite the pressure of 765 mm. in
Table       II, it
             is seen that the experimental value is practically identical
with  that derived from Zeuner's formula. From the experiments
0000609, from the formula 0000610. I have thought, then, Zeuner's
results probably the safest to adhere to of the many estimations that
have been advanced for the density of steam at atmospheric pressures.
   The method of using Table                    II
                                       is obvious.  The volume of the
substance estimated in cubic centimetres is multiplied by the suitable
value taken from the table.    This is the displacement in steam. The
displacement in air must also be estimated for the prevailing tem
perature,     and pressure, by reference to a table of air densities, as
                 <l7
the difference of the two is, of course, that which affects the observa
tion of the weight of the substance transferred to an atmosphere of
steam.
     If   it           to secure the observations from error as far as
               be desired
possible  at all  points, then two further corrections on the value of w
are necessary    — (1.) An allowance for the change of volume of the
                       :
substance due to thermal expansion      in passing from air temperature
to steam temperature.      This may be considerable in the case of metal
vessels or large masses of metal.     This correction    additive to the
                                                                       is
value of w.    (2.) A correction for the displacement in steam of the
precipitated water, i.e., the reduction to vacuo of the weight of water
w.   This    also an additive correction.
                is
   Both these corrections are included in the following equation for
the true       weight of condensation,          w,
                                   tp   =   ".-ViP±Vai,                             (2)
            where      Vj =    volume of the substance at        tx,
                       D = density of air at and prevailing pressure,
                                                      tx

                       Wj = the weight added during experiment.
     This      formula     departs from strict accuracy only in so far as            it
assumes        unit    mass of water to occupy unit volume at the temperature
of   the steam.
  Approximate Correction for Displacement. — In a great many cases,
the vast majority of cases, indeed,  will be sufficient to substitute
                                                     it

   Correction for the Currier. — A deduction, from the observed weight
of precipitation, due to the calorific capacity of the carrier is of
course necessary.        This is effected on a previous experiment (or ex
periments) on the empty carrier and proportionately to the relative
extent of the ranges in the two cases.
  On the Accuracy     of  the Method     and the  Error arising from Radiation.
   Many experiments bearing on the accuracy of the method are con
tained in my former papers.            It is sufficient to say here that : — (1.)
Successive experiments on the same piece of matter, whether a good
conductor of heat or a bad conductor, show one with another a con
sistency of result exceeding that found in the records of observations
by other methods, as in Regnault's experiments, using the method
of mixtures on a very elaborate scale, and dealing with very large
quantities of matter.           (2.) The results obtained, both with good
conductors and bad conductors, agree closely with the most reliable
determinations of Regnault, Bede, Mallet, &c.                  (3.) Wide variations
in extent of surface, and in the quantity of the substance placed in
the calorimeter, fail to affect the consistency of the result.                  I will
explain with one example.              A limpid crystal of barytes weighing
76-109 grams, placed        in the   calorimeter,  afforded 0-10923 as the mean
specific heat between 9-65° and 100-30°.                It was now broken up into
small fragments, which were piled up on the carrier : 65-143 grams
were thus returned to the calorimeter.                 These afforded 0'1G910 as
the mean specific heat over the range 9-60° to 99-80°.
   This no mere accidental coincidence.*               It is certainly exceptional
for repetition experiments to differ by more than half per cent. With
ordinary care, indeed, they are quite as faithful and as sure as
repetition determinations of specific gravity made in the ordinary
way, and on similar quantities of matter.
   It is to be added that since the experimental evidence in support
of the method was published much has been done, using various
modifications of the apparatus.              I  have found that the results in

in the disposition of its parts from the form designed for use within
the case of a balance as described in my former paper.   In the course
of some recent experiments on the mineral sulphides, I desired to
check in some cases former results, by dealing over again with the
specimens dealt with in the first calorimeter.     have collected these          I

                         following considerations.                                                                  :
(a.) The film of water, which     almost immediately formed upon the
                                                            is
Mibstance,    having its outer surface continually renewed by precipi
                         is
tation of fresh steam, and hence presents a surface but slightly
cooler than the surrounding steam.      (&.) This film of water will be
very adiathermanous to radiation from water vapour, so that most of
the steam will condense, not by radiation, but by contact with the
slightly cooler outer service of the water-layer.       (c.) A reduced
pressure will obtain, or tend to obtain, around the substance, giving

228                            Mr.   J.   Joly.
 rise to an inflow of the surrounding steam. This condition tends to
 correct what error might arise from radiation from points in the
 vapour near the surface of the body.          Vapour so precipitated will,
 in fact, be carried by the indraught and thrown upon the substance.
 In view of this, care is taken so to construct the calorimeter that no
 sharp cross-draughts play upon the substance on the entry of the
steam, which might possibly diminish the protective effect of the
indraught,      (d.) It is possible that during this first period, if the
walls of the calorimeter beat more quickly than the substance, some
radiation might occur from the walls to the substance, appearing as
a minus error, in the result.     It is to be added, however, with regard
to (d) that the entire duration of this first period is very short, and
that the quantitative results of experiments on substances show com
plete independence of surface conditions.
    During the second period, in which the weighing is effected, the
substance is to be considered as surrounded by a medium which, with
out change of temperature, maintains the inner surface of the walla
of the calorimeter uniformly at the temperature of the substance or
very nearly so, and which itself acts as a screen very opaque to radia
tion. So that, so soon as the substance has ceased absorbing energy,
the conditions are very favourable to preserve it from the effects of
further action from radiation. Nevertheless, there is an amount of
radiation effect continuing uniformly during this period, and this
on a sensitive balance is perceived by continued observation.         This
was first pointed out    to me by Professor Himstedt, of Darmstadt, who,
after the appearance of the papers on this method of calorimetry,
kindly sent me the results of his observations on instruments of the
types described both by Professor Bunsen and by me. He found the
weight of the substance hanging in the steam was not absolutely
constant, but was subject to an accretion of some 3 or 4 milligrams in
an hour.
    As it was desirable to ascertain the cause of this increment *nd
how far it could be reduced, and as, too, it was quite conceivable that
occasion might arise when allowance for it would have to be con
sidered, I made a considerable number of protracted observations
upon it.    It is sufficient to observe here that the effect seems with
most probability a radiation effect.         It is greater for rough than
smooth bodies.      Lamp-blacking the substance, or the inside of the
calorimeter much increases it. Cooling the outside of the calorimeter,
as by spraying cold water upon it, increases it.         Calorimeters with
double walls, having bright reflecting surfaces, show less increment.
For large calorimeters it is less than for small ones. It is uniform or
nearly so for however long the experiment is continued. On the other
hand, increase of the rate of flow of the steam through the calorimeter
does not seem to affect it,   which appears to differentiateit   from any

                          On  the Steam   Calorimeter.                    229
tiling like an effect due to mechanically suspended water in the steam.
It appears, in fact, to arise from a slow loss of heat from the substance
to the walls of the calorimeter, steam, in consequence, condensing on
the substance.
    The numerical results of my own experiments, effected in a large,
single-walled calorimeter of spherical form, 14 cm. in diameter, are
such as to afford : — '
         3 milligrams per hour on a clean, blown glass sphere having a
            surface of 80 sq. cm.
         4 milligrams per hour on a dull surface of platinum of 80 sq. cm.
         8 milligrams per hour on a lamp-black coated surface of
            80 sq. cm.
    These results were obtained using a roomy calorimeter.
    Prom experiments in a calorimeter of the type to be             presently
described,    but somewhat smaller (8 cm. in diameter) and double-
walled only on the lower, removable part,        I take the following : —
    (1.) A clean, but not bright, copper box, cylindrical in form,
having an external surface exposed to the steam of 52 sq. cm.
nearly, standing in a platinum-foil catchwater, exposing an effective
surface of 57 sq. cm. ; total 109 sq. cm. of clean metal, showed
an increment of from 0-45 to 0.5 milligram per 5 minutes.                Thus
successive observations of the increment every 5 minutes afforded : —
         0-4      0-5     0-4      0-4     0-4      0-5      (V5   05.
    The inside of the calorimeter in this experiment was smooth and
clean.    Later   I  made the experiment of gilding and burnishing the
inside surface of the calorimeter.        This appeared, however, to make
no sensible difference : thus, with all otherwise as above, observations
gave the increment per 5 minutes : —
                 0-5      0-5     0-5      0-6     0-5       0-5.
    (2.) A rough block of cryolite weighing 37 grams, resting on the
platinum catchwater as above, gave 0-74 milligram per 5 minutes ,
the observations     were :—
                      0-7     0-8      07      0-8      0-7.
    (3.)  The catchwater of platinum foil alone, with stirrup, as
described    in (1), in the calorimeter previous to gilding its interior
gave the increment, determined every 5 minutes :—
         02      0-3      0-3     0-4      0-3      0-4      05    03
                                   0-3     04.
                    Mean increment, 0-34 per     5 minutes.

 230                              Mr.  J. Joly.
     (4.) The stirrup, which is of silver tarnished to blackness, and the
 cross wires serving as the platform, without the catchwater, gave : —
                      0-1     01        0-2     01      02
                          Mean,   0¦14  per 5 minutes.
     I have chosen these observations      out of a large number of various
 experiments as sufficient to give a good idea of how far this radiation
 effect should be considered in observations made with this calorimeter.
 But before dealing further with this question a few more experiments
 mu^t be added.
     (5.) Frequent observations with sensitive thermometers failed, even
 under extreme conditions, to reveal radiation across the steam to the
 walls of the calorimeter. These experiments were conducted in this
 manner. A very delicate thermometer, removed from a hypsometer,
 was coated thickly with lamp-black over the bulb, which measured
 some 4 cm. in diameter.            This was arranged so that the bnlb
 occupied the centre of a spherical brass calorimeter, single walled, and
 left clean on the inside. Diameter, 14 cm. Steam was admitted and
 the position of the mercury in the projecting stem of the thermometer
 observed through a teloscope. Cold water was now plentifully sprayed
 over the surface of the calorimeter, but, although an observer atten
 tively watched the thermometer through the telescope while this was
 being done, no change in the position of the thread of mercury could
 be detected.    All this time the abundance of evaporated water rising
 from the outside of the calorimeter and the increased drip from the
 inside showed that heat was rapidly passing through the walls. This
 experiment is surprising, perhaps, but if the extreme smalluess of the
 effect indicated in the weight-experiments be considered, it need not,
 I   think, negative the suggestion that the increment is a radiation
  effect.
     (C.)  It remains to add what is perhaps the most conclusive experi
 ment on this radiation question — the experiment of coating the inner
  walls of the calorimeter with lamp-black and comparing the rate of
  increment with the rate obtaining in the absence of this coating.
  The increase of surface with the lamp-black is the greater, as the many
¦tiny globules of water
                           condensing from the steam and adhering to the
  inner wall become each coated with the rough black deposit.        Steam
  was first passed through the space between the walls of the calori
  meter till all was heated.       Had this not been done, the deposit of
  lamp-black would have been washed away from the inner surface by
  the copious condensation.       When the steam had been some 5 or 6
  minutes in the calorimeter, the current through the jacket was stopped
  and observations begun.       It is to be observed that the presence of
  moisture between the walls would tend to diminish the protective

                           On  the Steam      Calorimeter.                      231
 effect  of the jacket, increasing radiation. With everything else            as  in
  (1)  [utile], observations every 5 minutes gave : —
                   34      40        36        30       3-8      82.
                      Mean,  3-5   milligrams per    5  minutes.
    (7.) The lamp-black was now removed and the inside cleaned.
 With the same order of procedure as before exactly, and everything
 the same except for the absence of the lamp-black, the results
 are: —
                07      07      0-8        11      11       0-8      10,
                     or nearly 0'9 milligram per       5 minutes.
    The effect of the water deposited between the walls of the jacket is
 probably seen in the difference between this experiment and the results
 of (1).     The difference existing between the results of (6) and (7) is
 conspicuous and so far as       I can see can only be explained in the hypo
 thesis that the increase is due to radiation.           The inference is strong
 that the ordinary effect is also in some degree, if not entirely, of the
 same nature.
    When in special cases it is thought necessary to allow for this effect
 of  radiation (as I will call it), I would suggest making an observation
 on the amount of the increment, say over 10 minutes, subsequent to
 the weighing being completed, and deducting proportionately to the
 time occupied in weighing — not proportionately to the time since the
 first admission of steam into the calorimeter, as I do not think it is
 warranted to assume that the same effect obtains during the period in
 which the substance is rising in temperature.             It is to be remembered,
in fact, that (as before observed) an effect of the opposite sign as
affecting the observed condensation              on the body may then have
obtained.       It is to be observed that some of the increment will be
due to the carrier.       This would have amounted to rather more than
one half in such a case as (2), considerably more in (1). The ordinary
deduction from the total condensation for the calorific capacity of
the carrier will eliminate approximately this portion of the radiation
increment.
    But it may     be asked  : how is     it to be determined      at what precise
momeui.      the true precipitation has ceased       ?   when has the substance
attained the temperature of the steam ?
    In considering this question it is necessary to realise the nature of
the phenomena observed in the course of an experiment.                     Suppose
the 37 grams of cryolite, previously referred to, was being dealt with.
Steam is admitted.          For three minutes, about, we try in vain to
equilibrate the balance.          Equilibrium is impossible for the reason
that condensation is progressing so rapidly upon the cryolite that so
soon    as   an approximation to equilibrium           is obtained    this is again

232                              Mr.  J. Joly.
immediately disturbed. The gain is so rapid during this period that
weighing, or observation of the rate of increase, is impossible with
the ordinary balance.     Between this state of things and that prevailing
subsequently, when weighing has become possible, there is, of course,
no abrupt transition.       But, as observed, it is found simply that
weighing (in such a case as      I am considering) has become possible,
probably in the course of the fourth minute. Let the vibrations of
the balance be now observed.         The oscillations are perfectly regular
for about one minute.       If the balance reads tenths of milligrams, a
slight preponderance of weight will probably be then observable.
Watching the vibrations for 5 minutes from the fourth minute,
suppose, and then moving the rider till there is equilibrium, the gain
is found to be seven-tenths of a milligram.         Observing the balance
for another period of 5 minutes, the result is again seven-tenths, and
so on.   However long observation is carried on, the gain is seven or
eight-tenths per 5 minutes.
   Now this is certainly not due to heating of the substance, and it is
established by the observations that the seven-tenths of a milligram
represents an uniform rate of increment.         But from the fourth to the
ninth minute observation gave but seven-tenths.         It is safe, therefore,
to conclude that by the end of the fourth minute the true condensation
due to the calorific capacity of the substance has ceased.
   It remains to consider numerically the importance of this source of
error in affecting the degree of accuracy attained by this method of
calorimetry.   I will illustrate this effect by assuming an extreme case
in which the increment is entirely ignored, no correction being made
for it except the unconscious one made in effecting the deduction for
the carrier, and I will suppose that after weighing has become practi
cable 10 minutes be allowed to elapse, in order to put the temperature
of the substance beyond question.         I will consider, both in the case
of a non-conductor of heat and in the case of a good conductor, the
consequent effect on the accuracy of the result.
   (a.) For the former I cannot do better than take the case of the
piece of cryolite referred to in (2).        It weighs 37 grams. For a
range   of  90 degrees   I   get from an experiment on this specimen
(" Specific Heats of Minerals," p. 263) that there would be a con
densation of 1'588 grams due to the calorific capacity of the cryolite
alone.    The increment during the time of observation, according to
(2) [ante], will be 0'74x2 = l-48 milligrams.           Observations on the
carrier over a similar interval have, suppose, been made once for all.
The deduction due to its thermal capacity then reduces the radiation
effect by 0'34 x 2 or 0-68 milligram ; leaving a + error of 0.8 milligram.
This is an error of 0'05 per cent., or 1 in 2000, on the specific heat
determined.
   (6.) Let the  case be   that of a piece of copper having the dimensions

                       On   the Steam   Calorimeter.                    233
of the copper box referred to in (1), that is, a cylinder 3.65 cm. in
diameter x 4'50 cm. in length.          This will be abont 405 grams of
copper, giving through a range of Q(f a precipitation of 6-343 grams
of steam.     The increment in 10 minntes, less that of the carrier, is
0'5x2— 0.34x2 = 0'32 milligram. The error introduced by neglecting
this is 1 part in 20,000 about.
   These figures afford an idea of the extent to •which this radiation
effect, if neglected entirely, affects the results obtained in these calori
meters.     And, in practice, even these are excessive ; they double the
error actually obtaining, for it will be found that half the interval
assumed for observation will be more than sufficient in order to be
quite sure of the weighing, and of the condition of the substance
when of such dimensions as I have assumed.
   What radiation error then can be detected with this method of
condensation is not alone in general extraordinarily small, but its
amount is easily ascertained, and a close approximation to its entire
elimination possible.    To the question whether undetected error from
radiation or other causes enters into the quantity of steam precipitated
upon the substance in the first instance an answer, based on direct
experiment, cannot be given.           Comparative experiments on sub
stances, using other methods, would not afford a conclusive answer, as
the exact extent of the error entering into other methods is at least
equally open to surmise.       It is to be said, however, that, a priori, no
grave error is to be expected, and what experimental tests have been
applied appear to show that such error if existent must be very small.
I have mentioned the general results of these tests.
               The Construction   of the Steam Calorimeter.
  What is the best form to confer upon a steam calorimeter?         There
are so many conditions to fulfil that the choice is really not very large.
It must permit of being filled, rapidly with    steam, which should pre
ferably descend in the calorimeter, as it then mixes less with the air.
Arrangements must be made for allowing a slow current or circula
tion of steam to contiune all the time the weighing is being effected.
This must be such as will not interfere with the accurate deter
mination of the weight.      If this circulation of steam be stopped at
any time there is a minute but definite fall in temperature.          A
sensitive thermometer will show this. It is about the one-thirtieth of
a degree.    If the current be stopped when the body is accurately
poised, and   after an interval be started again, a minute increase of
weight is at once apparent. The substance has cooled in the interval
and is reheated on re-establishing the current.
   Although this current of steam may be quite slow while weighing
is proceeding, there must be complete control over       so that
                                                        it,         may
                                                                   it

234                              Mr.   J.   Joly.
be made rapid at first when air and mist are being swept out, as
the object then is to let in the pure steam as quickly as possible
around the substance.
   The construction at the point where the suspending wire passes
through to top of the calorimeter, ascending to the balance, must be
such that no rubbing of the wire in its vibration up and down occurs.
That is, the wire should hang in the centre of the necessarily small
orifice provided for it ; as this is a troublesome adjustment, an auto
matic arrangement should be provided. No condensation of steam
must occur on the wire where it passes out, or above that point, and
steam must be hindered from passing up along the wire into the
balance.
  To effect the accurate determination of               t°,  important that the
                                                              it   is
temperature in the interior of the calorimeter change slowly.                This
necessitates that the walls of the calorimeter be fairly non-conducting.
They must withal be light, or they will remain hot an inconveniently
long while after an experiment, and will take long to heat, which
hinders the rapid filling of the calorimeter with steam.
   The interior of the calorimeter must be easily got at for drying out
and cleaning, and for putting the carrier readily in its place.                It
should fit together fairly steam tight, and be simple in construction,
and so cheaply made.
   A sectional elevation to a scale of one-fourth of a convenient form
of the calorimeter   isgiven in PI.    6,  fig. 1   I

I    may   observe that, as  regards    the condition of preserving       steady
                                                                            a
internal temperature, no form not very cumbersome will confer
perfect satisfaction if used in a room in which a rapid variation of
temperature    issuffered to occur just before an experiment. In every
case  it will be necessary to carefully screen off the boiler supplying
the steam, so that the waste steam and hot gases from the burner pass
up a flue or directly out of the room.          It would be best of all to locate
the boiler in a neighbouring room, taking a steam pipe through the
wall. I     have myself suffered more from defect in this part of
the arrangements than any other, and what discrepancies occur
from one experiment to another              I    attribute to unsteadiness of
the initial temperature.       I     generally find that in the fifteen or
twenty minutes during which the boiler                    heating, the thermo
                                                          is
meter in the calorimeter may show a variation amounting                         to
one-tenth, often to one-fifth, of      a    degree.     My practice      to take
                                                                        is
three readings during that interval, one just before lighting the
burner beneath the boiler,       a   second when steam is up, and a third
just  before  making    an  experiment, after the steam has been let flow
freely out of the boiler up a flue for eight or ten minutes to clear air
and mist out of the boiler.      I  assume the mean of these three as the

mean temperature of the body if a bad conductor.            I  take the last if
a good conductor. In any case the error introduced will be small,
but, of course, it is to be avoided.
   It is seen in section that the calorimeter is double walled. The
carrier and catch water are shown hanging within it. In form it is
cylindrical, the inner cylinder being cone-shaped at each end. The
pitch of the upper cone is made so high that drops of water will run
down it, and not fall off it. It is of brass, very thin, the inside being
gilt and burnished. This is not essential, but keeps it very clean
from the sulphur and antimony which are carried from the rubber
steam-pipe by the steam. The surfaces between the walls are simply
burnished. Outside it is covered with well-shrunken cloth.                The
steam admission way is in the upper part of the calorimeter, and by
this pipe this upper part is securely fixed to the upright supporting
the table carrying the balance.      The lower part is entirely removable
from the upper.      It meets it on a well-ground surface, and is secured
in its place by an external bayonet catch at either side. Steam is
admitted by the brass pipe shown in position at the other side of the
upright. This pipe is removable and is very readily laid in its place,
being guided by a hollowed-out wooden support attached to the base
board of the calorimeter-stand.        It is connected by a thick rubber
tube, 2'4 cm. in internal diameter, with the boiler.          This tube must
have a fall the whole way to the boiler to keep it from choking with
water. On steam being admitted, it rapidly drives out the air, the
steam descending in the calorimeter.         To allow the air to escape, a
means is provided for opening the lower orifice of the calorimeter
fully. This is effected by rotating a milled-headed screw projecting
at the side of the stand, and shown dotted in the section.                 The
shaft from this screw passes across the face of the upright board
carrying the calorimeter, and is furnished with two projecting arms.
One of these is provided at its extremity with a hard-wood cup,
shown dotted, in the depressed position.         The other carries a conical
catchwater of brass with a sloped brass tube attached, shown in
position at the lower orifice of the calorimeter.        Either of these, the
wooden cup, or the cone and tube, may be brought to cover the
orifice in the calorimeter by a longitudinal movement (of about
2-5 cm.) of the shaft of the milled-headed screw.          Before experiment
the non-conducting       wooden    cup   closes  the  orifice.    Just before
coupling with the boiler, this is depressed and pushed back.            When
it in judged   from  the  appearance  of  the steam  escaping at the orifice
that all air is expelled, the cone and tube are elevated against the
orifice, closing it except for a slow current of steam still free to issue
from the sloped tube.       The water draining from the calorimeter also
issues through this tube, falling into a dish placed to receive it.
    The thermometer for reading the initial temperature is inserted in

236                               Mr.  J. Joly.
the fixed upper part of the calorimeter.          It is at a convenient elope
for reading', and its bulb penetrates into the calorimeter till just over
the substance placod on the carrier.            In careful work it is well to
read the thermometer by a tolescope.          A very accurate, but less con
venient, way is to read with a lens, which is moved about till the
image of the last graduation on the stem of the thermoneter reflected
in the thread of mercury is seen to be covered by the graduation.
There is then no parallax error. The thermometer is withdrawn just
before letting in steam, and the tubulure plugged with a small cork.
After the weighing is finished, a thermometer for reading the boiling
point may be inserted in this tubulure. Previous to the admission of
steam, the tubulure taking the steam-pipe is kept closed by the
stopper of wood overlaid with cloth, shown dotted in its position.
The side pieces which go towards supporting the table forthe balance
are cut out as shown at each side, so that the operator can see to
remove the stopper, and insert the steam-pipe rapidly.            My practice
is to pinch the rubber tube conveying the steam for the moment in
which the steam-pipe is being laid on; when in position it is released,
and steam let flow into the calorimeter.          The steam-pipe is in part
covered with thick baize, so that it may while hot be grasped by the
 hand.
    A  section, fig. 2, PI. 6, full size, shows the arrangement adopted to
render the wire in its passage through the roof of the calorimeter
self-adjusting in the centre of the orifice provided for it, or rather to
render the orifice self-adjusting on the wire. The coned roof of the
inner wall of the calorimeter is carried through the external cylindrical
jacket, flanged at the top, and ground smooth.            A loose coned piece
also with gronnd flange rests       on this.  The upper end of this cone is
turned down to a knife edge, and just brought flat on a line stone.
 On this a tiny disk of copper or brass drilled centrally with an orifice
about two-thirds of a millimetre in diameter is laid looosely.            The
 wire bearing the carrier is brought through this disk, which weighs
about 22 milligrams.          Above the disk is placed a spiral of fine
 platinum wire held in a forceps, which by two binding screws may be
 put in circuit with a battery.        Through this the wire also passes.
 Finally, before the wire rises into the balance, it is embraced by an
 inverted cone (fig. 1), turned in hard wood, which is adjustable in
 position, being held to the under face of the table by two spring
 clips, as a slip is held on the stage of a microscope.         On the table a
 balance, not shown in the figure, stands.           The wire ascends to the
 left arm of this balance.
    The adjustment of the suspending wire is very obvious.                The
 balance is set so that the wire hangs freely through a large aperture
 in the table provided for it. The inverted cone and the small cone
 on the calorimeter are next set to let the wire pass centrally.          The

                           On   the, Steam Calorimeter.                        237
aperture in the inverted cone is about 2 mm. in diameter, that in
the lower cone about 3 mm.              Their adjustment, therefore, does not
present any difficulty, and once made need se'dom be disturbed. Tho
disk resting on the lower cone is permitted to adjust itself. Daring
an   experiment, it is kept warm by radiation from the platinum spiral,
which is put in circuit with a storage cell. It thus remains dry and
quite free to move about on the knife edge of the cone. As the wire
swings about, it carries it with it from side to side. Finally, when
the amplitude of the vibrations diminish sufficiently, it leaves it
correctly adjusted, for, of course, the swinging wire will always so
shift the disk as to swing in a diameter of the orifice.            This arrange
ment     I   have fonnd to act very perfectly.          The adjustment of the
wire in the old arrangement was very troublesome ; it demands no
attention with this, which in no way interferes with the weighing.
The disk should not be lighter than the weight spocified, for if too
light the amount of steam pressure which it is necessary to maintain
will raise it at one side.
    It is remarkable as regards the platinum spiral for maintaining the
orifice dry that an error may be introduced if this is kept at too high
a temperature.        It apparently then sets up an ebullition of the water
precipitated on the upper part of the calorimeter, the result being a
splashing or rain upon the substance hanging below. I have been
led to suppose this by observing that the radiation effect is apparently
 increased by heating the spiral excessively.           On the other hand, too
 cold a spiral, of course, also causes error. by permitting water to con
 dense on the wire both above and below the orifice.                    The right
 temperature       seems  to  be  that  which  gives to  the spiral  a just visible
 red when steam is not in the calorimeter. The effect of the up draught
 of steam is to cool it.
    The suspending wire should be of platinum ; about (VI mm.
 diameter will be sufficiently strong for most purposes.             This ascends
 to the left end of the balance beam, being directly attached to a
 counterpoise equilibrating the right-hand pan.
     It is well to load the balance till there is equilibrium when the
  empty carrier is in position.         The counterpoising of the substance
  before an experiment then affords its weight, with, of course, the
  ordinary correction for air displacement, if thought necessary.
     The balance used by me is a Sartorius short-beam (14 cms.). The
  cheap form of this instrument answers admirably, reading accurately
 to tenths of milligrams when loaded with over 100 grams.                   It will
 do so,   I  believe, up to 200 grams.       It is quick, and in every way is
  perfect   for  the purpose.      On  removing the pan stops the suspending
  wire may be taken through the drilled aperture left in the plate-glass
  base.
     The stand of the calorimeter is of well-seasoned        mahogany, strongly

238                                    Mr.  J. Joly.
fitted together.         To enable it to be levelled, it is supported on two
levelling screws        in front and a centrally placed foot at the back.         To
afford more vertical room, the base board is cut out centrally in front.
The carrier for supporting the substance within the calorimeter is
shown in position within the calorimeter.               It is made of silver wire,
about 0'5 mm. in diameter.              The catchwater is of thin platinum-foil,
and is removable for drying and cleaning.                  It is, in fact, supported
on a projecting claw beneath the ring of the carrier.                    Across this
ring   fine  platinum      wire  is stretched,  forming   a platform   on  which the
substance may be laid.              Four wires crossing at the centre will in
general     be   sufficient.  When     resting on these the substance is exposed
to the steam on all sides.              The total weight of the carrier is just
3 grams.        It condenses about 0'031 gram through a range of 90° C.
    The claw supporting the catchwater performs a double function.
In the case of a smooth body, which is also a good conductor of heat
and of large thermal capacity, such as a thin vessel filled with water,
the precipitation is so copious and sudden that it reaches the catch
water before it attains steam temperature.               The result is a secondary
precipitation on the outside of the catchwater. This might be in
some cases so plentiful as to drop from the bottom of the catchwater,
and so be lost.         The claw serves to entangle this, retaining it on the
 balance.
    It  is important that an ample supply of steam should flow into
the calorimeter on connecting it to the boiler.                    To make certain
of this, a strong gas-burner and a large boiler should be used. The
supply, indeed, should be considerably in excess of what passes up
the connecting-tube.            If this is not so there is risk of air entering
the boiler on first coupling it with the calorimeter, which, mixing
with the steam, causes a mist of the cooled vapour to flow up the
tube.       The danger of this is considerable, as there is a strong
tendency to an indraught at the boiler, owing to the buoyancy of the
water-gas in the ascending tube. In some experiments on the value
of the radiation effect, before alluded to, this came strikingly to my
notice. The boiler was fitted with a pressure-relief arrangement,
consisting simply of a tube taken externally from the top of the
boiler, bent twice at right angles and brought downwards, so that it
opened at a level below the bottom of the boiler.                    Thus a certain
 small pressure of steam in this was necessary to drive the buoyant
gas down this escape-pipe.
    Hence      I   concluded      that the continued appearance             of steam
escaping at the relief-pipe was a sufficient indication of an excess of
internal pressure. However, in my experiments a large and unaccount
able increment to the weight of precipitation on the substance pre
vailed, and this I traced after much trouble to the entry of air at the
relief-pipe. There was, in fact, a circulation of air and steam within

                          On   the Steam   Calorimeter.                239
the tube and boiler   ;   air entering and flowing along one side of the
pipe, steam issuing along the other.   On narrowing the opening of
the tube, so that a well-defined current of steam having the full
section of the tube issued, the effect disappeared. The foregoing
method     of providing for the exit of the surplus steam is defective
 and unsafe.    It is preferable to use a non-return valve of some sort.
 I find the simple arrangement shown on the boiler in PI. 7 (scale
 one-tenth) very effective.    It is simply a balanced flap-valve, meeting
 the vertical exit-tubulure on a ground edge brought fine, so as not
to stick with precipitated water.      The counterpoise to the weight of
 the flap can be placed at discretion in one of several notches near the
 end of the beam, so that the pressure may be increased or diminished.
 To keep this valve from falling into vibration, the pivot on which it
 turns bears at one end against a screw, which may be tightened so as
 to retard a little the oscillatory motion of the beam.       The pressure
 maintained should be small, as pressures appreciably in excess of
 atmospheric pressure interfere with the working of the calorimeter.
 The valve should therefore be so set that it just falls shut readily
 when steam is not issuing.       This, according to measurement, in the
 case of the valve used by me corresponds to rather less than a pres
 sure of 1 mm. of water.      The material of the boiler is copper, tinned

    Method of Carrying out an Experiment. — will suppose the calori
 meter dry and cold, and ready for the introduction of the substance.
 This is placed on the carrier which hangs within the calorimeter
 dependent    from the balance.         Having adjusted the substance
 centrally on the carrier, and so that there is no tear of water dropping
 from any protruding point of the substance over the edge of the
 catchwater, and so escaping estimation by the balance, the ther
mometer for taking the initial temperature of the substance is to be
inserted in its tubulure.     This is done now, before closing the calori
meter, in oi'der to see      that  its bnlb does not strike against the
substance or the stirrup of the carrier, and that it is inserted suffi
ciently far to be well over and close to the substance.      The substance
should now be roughly counterpoised by placing weights in the right-
hand pan of the balance, and before the final adjustment of the
balance, the calorimeter closed.       On now finally adjusting the equi
librium of the balance, we observe if the wire swings freely through
the several orifices through which it passes. The weight placed on
the right-hand pan affords W, the weight of the substance,            if,as

time to ensure that the thermometer and substance are uniformly at
one and the same temperature.        This interval of course varies with
the nature and mass of the substance.         In accurate work sufficient
interval must be left to leave no doubt on the matter, the room being
one not subject to sudden variations of temperature.             When the
required interval has elapsed, the thermometer is read by a hand
lens, or better through a telescope.     The temperature is noted down.
The burner is now lighted beneath the boiler, all hot gas and
steam being arranged to pass directly out of the room, as already
mentioned, and direct radiation carefully screened off from the
calorimeter. When the water is boiling, a second reading of the
thermometer is taken and noted down.         The boiler is now suffered to
pass steam through the coupling-tube for about ten minutes, to
ensure that all is free from air and mist. During this time it is
better that the tube be directed so that the steam escapes up a flue
or out of the room. The interval is to be utilised in checking the
equilibrium of the balance, noting down the position of the rider,
and observing if the valve on the boiler is working freely and with
out vibration.    At the expiration of the interval, a third reading of
the thermometer is taken and rapidly noted.           It is then carefully
withdrawn from the calorimeter, laid aside, and its tubulure stop
pered with a little cork kept for the purpose.        Everything is now
ready   for  admitting  steam.     The  steam-pipe,  with   its nozzle held
upwards, is laid out along the slanting board which supports it
between the boiler and the calorimeter.        The nozzle is then grasped
in the right hand, the steam-jet being still directed upwards.        With
the left hand we turn the thumb-screw commanding the exit tubulure
at the bottom of the calorimeter, opening it to the full. The stopper
closing the entrance-way to the rear of the calorimeter is now to be
withdrawn, and then bringing the left hand back to the rubber
steam-tube, we pinch it sharply at a convenient point, some 20 cm.
below the nozzle, which, while the escape of steam is thus for the
moment prevented, is run into its position.           The steam tube is
instantly released, and we give our attention to connecting by a
switch the platinum spiral with the storage-cells.         This only takes
a moment, but by this time the steam is already pouring out at the
exit way.     For thirty or forty seconds it should be permitted to flow
out freely ; what little condenses on the surrounding objects dries off
quickly, and does no harm.        The <tir being thus completely cleared
out, the ontflow of steam is moderated by closing the smaller tubulure
against the exit-way, and in from one to three or four minutes,
according to the nature and quantity of the substance, the weighing
may be effected.
   It will be at once seen by the balance if the substance is completely
heated or not.    If it is, it will be found that the vibration of the

pointer continues symmetrical, gaining only imperceptibly, perhaps,
one    division to the right in about five minutes.       This will represent
about half a milligram.         Observed now for another five minutes, a
similar addition    will be needed.      This increment is due to radiation,
and the milligram thus accruing during the ten minutes is not to be
incinded in the value, Wj, which we now have obtained.
    The experiment is now concluded.          It is well, after disconnecting
it from the boiler, and while the calorimeter is still hot, to dry it out,
 as  the residual heat then completes the drying very thoroughly.          The
corrections on Wj, necessary to convert it to the value w          of the final
equation have already been considered.
                      The Differential Steam Calorimeter.
    In the use of the apparatus just described, it is-certain that a high
degree of     accuracy is attained.    In the thermometry and in the esti
 mation of the weight of steam condensed upon the substance, an
 accuracy of one part in one thousand may,             I  think, generally be
attained.      There remain certain causes of error unknown in value
within limits, as in all calorimetric methods.         In other methods the
substance is transferred from a region        at one temperature to a region
at another.      The error of transference has in these cases to be con
 sidered.     The movement of the substance, when at its highest tem
 peratures, through the air, may be a source of serious error ; nor can
 this error be indefinitely diminished, for a too close approximation of
 the heater and the cooler causes a transference of heat between the
 two, in itself a source of error.     In the method of mixtures a further
source of error      is to  be   found   in the continued radiation of the
calorimeter and evaporation of the water contained in it.
    In the method of condensation the substance is not moved, but the
medium around it is changed.           Is there any error comparable with
the error of transference         in other methods ? There doubtless is
some error, but it is not to be expected that it is at all as great.      The
error in this case is simply the radiation of the approaching vapour
to the substance.       Now the velocity with which the steam can be
brought to fill the calorimeter is very great, and the momentary radia
tion of the advancing steam upon the substance is in part com
pensated by the precipitation of the most active part of this radiating
steam upon the substance.
    Radiation between the substance and its precincts now begins at a
certain rate, the value of which when the temperatures become steady
can easily be estimated.       The first error is a minus error, the second
a plus error.      There may be also some minus error of the second
sort.    The errors thus tend towards a balance.             All experimental
work indicates that the resultant error is very small.           Experiments
                                                                    T 2

in which the surface extent of the same substance                        is varied con
 siderably more especially point to this conclusion.          If         these are to be
taken as conclusive, the error must be most generally less than the
proportion one in a thousand. The variations in successive experi
 ments are of about this magnitude, but are not in any special direction,
 and so point to no source of error in particular.         These experiments
 are on conductors.     (See  "Method     of Condensation,"     p. 362.)
    The change of medium around the substance from one of greater
to one possessing less buoyancy affects the balance and has to be
allowed for by calculation based on experiment.           It is improbable that
more than a very small error arises from this source.              Special cases
may, however, arise in which this may not be so ; and it was chiefly
to avoid error from this last source that, in dealing with the large
spheres of thin metal, used in the determination of the specific heat
of air at constant volume,              I
                                   resorted to the use of the differential
calorimeter.* This has the further advantage of eliminating the
radiation error affecting observations in the simple calorimeter. Nor
need the thermal expansion of the substance any longer be con
sidered.    I describe the apparatus briefly here, as it seems in fact to
eliminate to a great extent, if not entirely, what small risk of error
obtains in the previously described apparatus.          Its advantages, how
ever,  are most conspicuous     in  the use  for  which  it was designed, the
only use to which, up to the present                 I
                                                 have applied it— the calori-
metry of gases.     Its application to this branch of physics must ever be
its most important use.       Indeed in the conditions obtaining in the
calorimetry of solids or liquids it is hardly called for. However, even
in these latter cases, where it is advisable to enclose the substance from
contact with the steam, the differential calorimeter would enable us
to effect the experiment somewhat more accurately than would be
possible with the use of the single calorimeter.
     Plate 7 shows, in side sectional          elevation, fig. 2, and front
sectional elevation, fig. 1, to a scale of one-tenth, the differential
calorimeter which         I
                        have at present in use in dealing with gases.
The spheres, one of which is used to hold the gas, are shown
hanging in the calorimeter.          The drawing needs little explanation
after what has been said about the single calorimeter. The principle
is obvious.     Apart from its special application to gases, it may be
said that the calorimeter is so constructed that carriers depending
from both arms of the balance are hung within                          it,
                                                                   side by side
and only a few centimetres removed from one another, the balance
used being a short-beam balance.           The substance may be enclosed
in    areceptacle of thin platinum or copper, with a screwed, air
tight lid, and placed upon one carrier a similar receptacle, also
                                                         ;

 closed      air-tight, permanently, if desired, is placed in the other
 carrier, but containing air only.                 The receptacles have been pre
viously calorimetrically compared, and adjusted to have the same
 thermal capacity as they have the same external volume.                            Such
 receptacles       are    most     conveniently constructed for dealing either
 with liquids or solids in small fragments. In these cases narrow-
 necked vessels, such as may be closed air-tight without difficulty,
 may be used.              The calorimetric adjustment may of course be
 effected by inserting a calculated weight of copper or other sub
 stance of known specific heat in the vessel deficient in calorific
 capacity, or the difference may be allowed to remain and the con
 stant recorded.
      The thermometer enters the calorimeter midway between the
 carriers ; and, as the calorimeter is of good conducting metal enclosed
 in an outer shield of wood, a uniform temperature may be assumed
  to prevail after some considerable                interval of quiet has elapsed.
  Now, whatever this temperature, or the temperature of the steam,
  the receptacles and carriers alone are without effect upon the balance.
  Nor will there be any increment perceived due to radiation.*                          If
 one receptacle, however, contain a substance the balance will in
 dicate a precipitation due solely to this substance.                     It is to be
 supposed that any error of transference of media will affect each re
 ceptacle alike, subsequent radiation will also affect them alike, and,
 as their volumes are identical, the varying buoyancy of the media is
  without effect on the balance.
      I have said the precipitation will be due solely to the substance.
  Evidently, however, in very accurate work this cannot quite be
 assumed.        In fact the thermal capacity of the air expelled from the
 one receptacle on the introduction of the substance must be considered.
 The precipitation due to this weight of air, considered as possessing
 the specific heat of constant volume, must be added to w, the observed
effect upon the balance.             As the air in these receptacles cannot be
considered as dry air, this specific heat may be taken as having
 approximately the value'0'176.              The volume of the substance must
 then, as with the use of the single calorimeter, be estimated, and the
 weight of air occupying this volume at the prevailing pressure and
temperature calculated. For the pressure 760 mm., and temperature
10° C, if the steam temperature be assumed as 100° C., the addition
to w is 0'000037 gram per c.c. of volume occupied by the substance.
    * To secure    this result,  I  have found — what might bo expected — that a similar
condition of surface is necessary.       With platinum vessels there would probably be
little difficulty in attaining this ; but with copper vessels  I have found it necessary
to keep both surfaces very free from grease and oxidised all over.          Washing in
ammonium hydrate and heating over a spirit flame seems to bring the surfaces to
the desired uniform and permanent condition.

  244                           Mr.  J. Joly.
  This will afford an idea as to the desirability of making the correction
  in any particular case. It is evident, too, that this additive correc
  tion, 0'000037 gram per c.c., might without further calculation be
  assumed as the correction in many cases, except very great accuracy
  be sought.
     The construction of the differential calorimeter, it will be seen
 from Pl. 7, differs from that of the single calorimeter, in being single
 walled, and having a removable box-like covering of wood, fitted on
  over all, through which the thermometer is inserted, and which is
 placed in position after the calorimeter is closed.    It is left on through
 out the experiment.     The obvious use of this box is to favour equi
 librium of temperature throughout the calorimeter. Steam is admitted
 centrally, led from the boiler through a thin brass tube. The dia
 meter conferred upon this tube in the calorimeter figured in the
 plate might with no disadvantage be reduced somewhat from that
 shown.     This steam tube is in three lengths : an elbow piece fitting
 into the boiler ; a straight horizontal piece of any required length ;
 and finally a vertical double- tee piece.  This last is capable of a rock
 ing movement about the axis of its lower horizontal member, so that
 the upper horizontal member may be shifted either to a central
 position behind the calorimeter, when it is in the position for throwing
 steam into the calorimeter, or to one side, when it no longer commu
 nicates with the interior of the calorimeter.       As drawn, it connects
 boiler and calorimeter. It is further necessary to provide the means
 of filling the whole steam pipe before filling the calorimeter. For
 this purpose the uppor horizontal member of the double-tee tube is
 furnished with two swinging valves, closing it at each end. Before
 an experiment, and when the tee tube is turned to one side, the outer
 one of these is drawn inside for a couple of minutes till the whole
 steam way has been thoroughly cleared of air and heated throughout.
 During this time the rear orifice of the calorimeter is closed by means
 of a stopper of cork, bound in soft cloth. When the steam pipe is
heated as described this is withdrawn, and the pipe simply shoved
across till it comes to a stop provided.        In this movement an auto
matic action lifts the inner valve, shoving it completely to one side,
bo that there is free way into the calorimeter.      This, as will be readily
understood, is effected by arranging that the edge of the hanging
valve strikes against the projecting tubulure of the short steam way
leading into the calorimeter. Subsequently, on inclining the tee piece
to one side, the valve resumes its old position, closing the steam pipe.
By this arrangement there is little or no leakage of steam, and the
operation of turning steam into the calorimeter is effected by one
movement of the hand.
    There is but one exit way' to the calorimeter. This is placed
centrally at the bottom.    Before experiment this is closed by means.

 of a cork   ; this is removed when steam is first admitted.           When the
 calorimeter is thoroughly filled it is replaced by a second cork, pierced
 by a short brass tube having a bore of about 7 mm.                The diameter
 of this   exit tube might also, with advantage,          be reduced   from that
 shown.
    The platinum spirals used in drying and warming the suspending
 wires at their points of exit are in series, of the same length and fine
 ness.    The automatic adjustment at the orifices is applied, and, indeed,
 alone renders      the differential      arrangement workable. There is no
 difficulty in effecting the most accurate observation of weight.
    The body of the calorimeter is cylindrical in form — a form used for
 its stiffness and inexpensiveness.           The ends of the cylinder are closed
 by   hemispherical       caps  of  thin,  spun copper.    These have' a swelled
 flange fitting smoothly over the ends of the cylinder, and are further
 kept in their places by two thumbscrews, fixed in the box covering
 the calorimeter, one at each end, and so located that when the box is
 in position and the screws screwed in, they will bear against the
 hemispheres.        Owing to the shape of the calorimeter, it is necessary
 to shelter  the  carriers     from drip by guards or umbrellas of thin Dutch
 metal, sprung on two projecting wires into the tubulures of the
 orifices, so that they can be removed and dried.
    To allow of weights being placed on either side of the balance,
 the ordinary stirrups must be removed.              The arrangement shown on
 the figure works well.          Weights may be laid on or taken off the little
 inner pans without swinging the suspending wires supporting the
 carriers.
    In conclusion, it may be worth remarking that many laboratory-
instruction, or even lecture-table experiments of interest may be
readily shown with the differential calorimeter.                Thus the law of
atomic heats     is   illustrated    by placing quantities  of two simple bodies,
proportional to their atomic weights, in the calorimeter, and equili
brating by weights placed in the upper pans.                On admitting steam,
the equilibrium of the balance will (theoretically) remain undisturbed.
Similarly Woastyn's law of the constancy of specific heats of bodies
in the free and combined states might be illustrated by placing the
free elements in the proportions of chemical composition on one carrier,
and an equal weight of the combined elements on the other.
    The application of the vapour calorimeter to the determination of
latent heats of vaporisation is very probably possible.             I regret that
neither this application of it, nor the allied question of the employment
of other vapours besides that of water, can be considered here, the
study of the capabilities of the steam calorimeter and a couple of its
applications having occupied my time up to the present.

         GONTHeE, F.R.S.             Received December 12, 1889—Read
         January    9, 1890.
                                        [Plate    8.]
     Of the few Mammalia in which no trace of a milk dentition has
  been found, Orycteropus, the        Aard-Vark, has always occupied a pro
  minent place, owing partly to the peculiar structure of its prominent
  teeth, and partly to its very doubtful systematic position.
     An opportunity has now fallen in my way of proving that it has
  after all two sets of teeth, those of the first, or milk set, being rudi
  mentary, and probably quite functionless, but nevertheless so far
  developed as to be all completely calcified, and to be for the most
  part readily distinguishable by form and position from those of the
  second or permanent set.
      Among the collections in the Natural History Museum there are
. two very young females          of Orycteropus afer in spirit, presented by
  Sir Richard Owen, and it is in these that the milk teeth now to be
  described occur.       The larger of the two measures 18 inches in total
  length, and the smaller 14 inches.
     Each of these specimens has a complete, although rudimentary, set
  of milk teeth, extending the whole length of the maxillary bones
  above, and along a rather shorter portion of the mandible below.
  None, however, are observable in the premaxillse, or in the correspond
  ing anterior part of the mandibles.             The teeth are all quite minute,
  and it is very doubtful whether they would ever have cut the gum.
   Specimens rather older than those before me are needed to determine
  this point.
      In the upper jaw there appear to bo normally no less than seven
   milk teeth (PI. 8, fig. 1). Of these the most posterior (figs. 4 — 6)
  is by far the largest, has a rudimentary crown, and two distinct
  roots, anterior and posterior. The second, proceeding forwards, is far
  smaller, and is simple and styliform.               The next, the third from the
  back, is  also  simple,   but  is far  larger    in   section, and its base is not
  closed up in either of the specimens ; on this account there seems to
  be just a possibility that this particular tooth is not a milk tooth at
  all, but only the tip of one of the smaller anterior permanent teeth,*
     * These small anterior permanent teeth fall out before the animal is adult, and
  are absent in the great majority of Museum specimens.            There is, however, an
  immature skull in the Cambridge Museum which shows the alveoli for no less than
  ten teeth above (at least on one side) and eight below, some of the minute styliform
  teeth belonging to these alveoli being still in position.   For the loan of this skull I
  have to thank Mr.  J. W. Clark, director of that Museum.

 which    it resembles closely in size ; on the other hand, however, its com
 plete calcification is in marked contrast to the soft condition of the
 other permanent teeth, and therefore it seems safer for the present
 to call it a backward milk tooth rather than a precocious permanent
 one.    This question again will be easily settled when rather older
 specimens are available for examination.
    In front of the three posterior teeth           there are  normally four
 very minute styliform ones, similar to, and equidistant from, each
 other, the most anterior placed close to the premaxillo-maxillary
 suture. Their shape is as shown in fig. 3.         On one side of one of the
 specimens,     however,  there  is an   additional   minute tooth near the
 suture, so that there are eight, instead of seven, milk teeth present in
 the jaw.
    Below, the dentition appears to be in a rather more advanced state
 of development, so that in the larger specimen the germs of the per
 manent teeth are distinguishable as well as the milk teeth (PI. 8,
 fig. 2).     The latter are here apparently only four in number ; the
 posterior one, as in the upper jaw, is large and two rooted, and is
 placed directly over the germ of what appears to be the fourth tooth
from the back in the adult animal. The three teeth in front of this
 large one are minute, pointed, about equidistant from one another,
and   apparently placed in relation to the permanent teeth as is shown
 in the drawing.      Between the two most anterior of these teeth there
 is a   larger one, equally elevated in the jaw with them, but as yet
 quite uncalcified, and therefore no doubt merely the tip of one of the
 small anterior permanent teeth.
    As to the structure of the milk teeth, a horizontal section of the
last upper one, ground down in the dry state, presents the appearance
shown in figs. 5 and C.         The numerous large openings seen in the
 sections are obviously the sockets into which pulp-papillse have
extended, and it is evident that if further material were available,
and the teeth were properly prepared and cut into sections, a com
mencement of the remarkable histological structure characteristic
of the permanent teeth would be found in the earlier dentition.
    Since then it appears that the three large posterior teeth of
 Orycteropus, already distinguished by their more molariform shape,
do not have milk predecessors, while all the small teeth anterior
to them do, and in addition the last milk tooth is markedly
different from those in front of it, we ought apparently no longer to
look upon this animal as homodOnt, but instead to consider it as
an originally heterodont form in which the incisors and canines have
been suppressed to allow free play to the mobile vermiform tongue.
    But important as a knowledge of the presence of a milk dentition
in Orycteropus is, it does not at present render any easier the difficult
questions as to the phylogeny and systematic position of that animal.

248                   A Milk    Dentition in Orycteropus.
Although called an Edendate, it has always been recognised as pos
sessing   many characters exceedingly different from those of the
typical American members of the order.* It has in fact been placed
with them rather on account of the inconvenience of forming a,
special order for its reception than because of its real relationship to
them.     Now, as they are either altogether toothless or else homodont
and monophyodont t (apart from the remarkable exception of
Tatusia%), it seems more than ever incorrect to unite with them the
solitary member of the Tubulidentata, toothed, heterodont, and
diphyodont, and differing from them in addition by its placentation,
the anatomy of its reproductive organs, the minute structure of its
teeth, and the general characters of its skeleton.
    But if Orycteropus is not genetically a near relation of the Eden
tates, we are wholly in the dark as to what other Mammals it is
allied to, and    I
                  think it would be premature to hazard a guess on the
subject.    Whether even it has any special connection with Manis
is a point about which there is the greatest doubt, and unfortunately
we are as yet absolutely without any palseontological knowledge of
the extinct allies of either.  Macrotherium even, usually supposed from
the structure of its phalangeal bones to be related to Manis, has
lately proved§ to have the teeth and vertebra of a Perissodactyle
Ungulate, and one could not dare to suggest that the ancestors of
Manis or Orycteropus were to be sought in that direction. Lastly, as
 the numerous fossil American Edentates do not show the slightest
 tendency to an approximation towards the Old World forms, we are
furnished with an additional reason for insisting on the radical dis
 tinctness of the latter, whose phylogeny must therefore remain for the
 present one of the many unsolved zoological problems.
  * On this subject   see especially Flower,   " On the mutual Affinities of the Animals
                                    '
composing the order Edentata,"    Zool. Soc. Proc.,' 1882, p. 358, et seqq.
      I
  t haye had tho opportunity      of examining specimens, apparently of a suitable
age, of Bradypus, Cholcepus, and  Dasypus, and can find in them no trace of a milk
dentition, while in each case thetips of the permanent teeth are already formed.
So careful has this examination been that      I
                                             feel sure none of these genera ever have
calcified rudiments of milk teeth, although the possibility remains that uncalci-
fied germs of such teeth may be present in still younger specimens ; and these may
yet be discovered by means of section-cutting and thorough microscopical search, a
method that  I hope will be employed by anyone having the opportunity of doing
so.           I
     Nor can find any rudiments of calcified teeth (which would in that case be
of the permanent set) in a young specimen of Manis.
   X The tooth-change of this Edentate is so peculiar, so very different from that
of all other Mammals, including Orycteropus, thut it Luis been supposed to be a
recently acquired and not an inherited characteristic at all.  Its presence     is,

fore, no evidence of a near relationship between Orycteropus     and the  true Eden
tates.— January 3rd, 1890.

          Effect of  the  Spectrum on   the Haloid Salts of Silver.     241)
  " On the Effect    of the Spectrum on the Haloid Salts of Silver."
        By Captain W. de W. Abney, C.B., R.E., D.C.L., F.R.S.,
        and G. S. Edwards, C.E. Received November 26, — Read
        December 12, 1889.
    In  1881 one of us gave, in the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society,' a
 paper with the same title as the above. Since then, however, he has
 been able to work out a more exact means of measuring the effect of
 the spectrum on these salts of silver, and it is our desire now to lay
 the improved results before the Society.
    In January, 1887, one of us read a paper before the Photographic
                                " On the mode of
 Society of Great Britain,                         measuring Densities of
 Photographic Deposits, with some remarks on Sensitometers," and in
 it alluded to the possibility of measuring the relative sensitiveness of
 a photographic plate to the different parts of the spectrum.           The
 plan there indicated, with some instrumental improvements, has
 been employed in the present instance.
    The method employed consists in throwing an image of the photo
 graphed spectrum on a white screen and measuring the density of
 the photograph at different points. As the spectrum of sun light
 abounds in dark Fraunhofer lines, it was evident that the sun
 would be a very inconvenient source of light by which to form the
 spectrum.     It was also inconvenient on account of the variation
 in intensity at different times of the year and day in its different
 parts.   After trials of various sources of light we came to the
 conclusion that the most practical source to employ was the light
 from gas, burnt in an Argand burner.                A somewhat whiter
 light would have been better, perhaps, since the ultra-violet rays
 would have been stronger ; but it appeared that, taking all things
into consideration, the convenience of gas light more than counter
balanced its disadvantages.         We may mention that the crater of the
positive pole   of the  electric light was used in some instances ; but, as
certain minima of action on some of the salts of silver experimented
with lay at parts of the spectrum where bright carbon bands were to
be found, the main researches were carried out by the aid of gas light.
    The apparatus employed for photographing the spectrum was that
employed in the previous research already alluded to.            The two
prisms employed were of medium dense white flint, each having an
angle of 62c.    The collimating lens was of the same material, and the
photographic lens was a rapid rectilinear doublet by Dalmeyer, of
16-inch focal length. In some cases one of the lenses of the doublet
was dismounted, and the other used as a single lens, giving a focal
length of about 30 inches.       An image of the gas flame was thrown

250        Capt.   W. de W. Abney and Mr. G. S. Edwards.
on the   slit of the collimator, producing a bright image when the slit
 had a width of -j^ of an inch. The bottom half of the slit was closed
 by a shutter when the gas spectrum was photographed.           To know
 the locality of the part of the gas spectrum impressed, a second
 spectrum of the electric arc was photographed below the gas spectrum,
 lithium and sodium being volatilised, to give a sufficient number of
fiducial lines.    The plate was then withdrawn from the slide and
 placed in an apparatus by which a series of small square portions of
 the plate lying parallel and below the last-named spectrum could be
exposed at will.
    The exposures of this series of squares varied between 3J seconds
 and 5 minutes, generally being 3£, 7£, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240,
 and 300 seconds.       The exposure was made to the light from an
Argand paraffin lamp placed at 6 feet from the plate. When the
 height of the flame was kept constant, no practical difference in
illumination was found, and no variation was found during a series of
exposures if the lamp were allowed to attain a constant temperature
 by burning ten minutes. The plate thus impressed with the various
images was developed in the ordinary manner with the proper
developer.
    If a gelatine plate were used, ferrous oxalate was usually employed ;
 whilst acidified sulphate of iron was employed if a collodion wet plate
were    being experimented with.        It has not been thought worth
while to record all the measurements of the various plates, but a selec
tion has been made of the most important results. It may be
remarked that only 5 per cent, addition of bromo-iodide of silver to
a bromide of silver emulsion sufficed to shift the place of maximum
sensitiveness of the plate from the blue towards the green, as shown
in the diagram. After development the plates were fixed as usual
and dried, and were then ready for measuring. The following diagram
shows the apparatus employed for the measurement, the description
of which is taken from a previous paper by one of us.
    A is the source of light — gas, paraffin, or other lamp; B is a lens
of about 9 inches focus, used as a condenser ; C is a double frame for
carrying the negative, N, which has an upward and side motion, so
that any part of the negative may be brought in front of the con
denser; D is a lens on a stand, used to focus the negative on the
screen E, which is black except one small square, as shown, where
the image of the part to be measured is thrown ; F is one of a series
of diaphragms used with D for the purpose of sharpening the image
and reducing its brightness when required ; H is the rod used to cast
the shadow on the white patch ; G is a flat mirror reflecting a beam
also on E ; K is the rotating apparatus placed in the path of the light
reflected from G, to diminish it at pleasure ; M is the small electro
motor which drives K. The rod H is so placed that the shadows

cast   by the beam from G, and coming through the negative, just
touch, and the two are equalised in brightness by means of opening
more or less the rotating sectors K.
   The negative to be measured was marked with a scale of
f\  inches, and, in cases of sudden change of density, to less.    It was
then placed in the measuring apparatus and measurements              com
menced.      When the square patches were measured, a thickish rod
was employed, but for the photographed spectrum a knitting needle,
£ of an inch thick, was substituted.       The opacities of the different
parts   of  the  film were  calculated from  where the negative showed
" no
       deposit," and the opening of the sectors when the direct and
reflected light balanced was taken as the standard.         The required
opening of the sectors showed but little variation for any of the
photographs.
   The scale of density corresponding to different times of exposure
was plotted from the readings of squares, and the readings of the
different parts of the photographed spectra were applied to the curve
so derived, and the density corresponding to the times of exposure
tabulated.     From the photographed spectrum of the arc the positions
of the different measured densities were known and the curve with
the reference Fraunhofer lines plotted in the usual manner.         From
these curves the curves for the normal or wave-length spectrum were
calculated, and it is these curves which are shown in the accompany
ing figures.
   Reverting to the paper to which we have referred (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,'
No. 217, 1881), it will be seen that the figures therein shown differ
from those here given. This is caused by the fact that the former
curves were only eye estimations of density, whilst the latter are the
comparative sensitivenesses derived from measured densities.

 252         Capt. W. de W. Abney and Mr. G. S. Edwards.
     That the former are not in great error will be seen by comparing
 the place of maximum density of the former with the place of maxi
 mum sensitiveness of the latter.
     It may be well to remark here on one point to which objection
 might be taken in the results. It has been assumed in making the
 scale that length of exposure is equivalent to the intensity of the
 light.    This is not a hasty assumption, but has been carefully tested.
 When the exposure is but the minute fraction of a second, then the
 substitution of length of exposure for intensity does not apparently
 hold good ; hut, when the exposures are such as are given to the
 scale, the substitution is perfectly legitimate.
     In the following tables the curves of the simple haloid salts of
 silver are given, as well as mixtures of two or more, and also double
 salts.    Where double salts of silver are shown they were prepared
 by mixing the alkaline salts in proper equivalent proportions, and
 then emulsifying in gelatine or collodion by adding the requisite
 amount of silver nitrate to them. Where simple mixtures are shown,
emulsions containing the proper equivalent amount of the silver salts
 were prepared and subsequently mixed.         It has been deemed desirable
 to give the values for the haloid salts when stained with certain dyes,
 such as are nsually employed in rendering photographic plates what is
 termed isochromatic. Attention is called to the fact that a mixture
of solutions of two dyes does not render the salts of the same sensi
tiveness to different parts of the spectrum as do the two dyes if
applied separately, washing taking place between the application of
each.      For erythrosin Mailman's well known formula was used to
obtain the coloured solution. The erythrosin was obtained from
 Germany, and showed only traces of fluorescence.           The cyanin was
obtained from Messrs. Hopkin and Williams, and appears to be made
 after Greville Williams' formula. When cyanin was employed, 5 grains
was dissolved in 1 oz. of alcohol, and water added to make up to
2 ozs.      This solution was poured over the plate, which was then
allowed to dry. The plate was then washed with equal parts of spirit
and water, and finally with water, and then exposed to the spectrum.
Similar results were obtained whether the film was dry or moist.

 I. "On a second Case of the Occurrence of Silver in Volcanic
     Dust, namely, in that thrown out in the Eruption of
     Tunguragua in the Andes of Ecuador, January 11th, 188fi."
     By J. W. Mallet, F.R.S., V.P.C.S., University of Virginia.
       Received February 7, 1890.
  In   apaper laid before the Royal Society three years ago,* I gave an
account of a specimen      of volcanic dust, or so-cal'td ash, from the
eruption of Cotopaxi of July 22nd and 23rd, 1885, in which asli
silver was found to be present in minute quantity, that being the first
instance in which this metal had been detected among the materials
ejected from volcanoes.     The specimen was sent me by my friend and
former pupil Sefior Julio R. Santos, of Bahia de Caraguez, Ecuador.
   In his letter accompanying      dated March 8th, 188(3, he said, " On
                                              it,
the 11th and 12th of January there was a terrific eruption from
Mount Tunguragua.        It     more than a century ago since the last
                                   is
eruption   of this volcano."     requested Sefior Santos to procure for
                                       I
me if   possible some of the ash from this unexpected outburst of
Tunguragua, which he kindly promised to do, and at once took steps
for the purpose, but his own absence from home and protracted stay
at Panama delayed the matter, and only in the early part of the
present year (1889) did the specimen reach me.
   In sending  it, on tho 8th of February last, he wrote to me that
"it was co1lected in Guayaquil on the 11th of January, 1886, on
sheets of clean cloth, by Sefior Ancisar Montalvo         . .   .  Monnt
Tunguragua     had  been  silent for  over a century     on  the  11th of      ;

278           Mr.  J. W. Mallet.      On a Second Case    of  the     [Mar. 6r
January, 1886, began its eruption, and it continued in eruption till
November of the same year."
    The volcano in question — about 16,500 feet in height — is one of the
great mountains of the Eastern Cordillera of Ecuador, lying some 50
or 60 miles south and a little east of Cotopaxi, in between 1° and 2°
of south latitude, and about 85 or 90 miles in a direct line from
Guayaquil on the coast of the Pacific, where the specimen of ash was
collected.     The appearance of the regular cone-shaped summit, rising
directly   from   a plain of only 5700 feet above sea level, is described as
very striking, crowned with perpetual suow, and resembling in aspect
Cotopaxi.      Villavicencio in his work on Ecuador thus speaks of it—
" Esta bellisima montana estd collocada d un nivel
                                                        inferior de todas las
otras montailas del Ecuador, la que hace que su altura aparente, mirada
desde su base, sea mucho mayor que la del Chimborazo.            .  .  .  Este

    The most notable eruption recorded was that of 1777.       The mountain
was long classed with apagados or extinct volcanoes, although from
time to time during the last century several explorers have reported

             as seen issuing from the summit.       It is generally believed
in the surrounding country that a subterranean communication,
following the line of the Andes, exists between this volcano and
Cotopaxi, the one showing signs of activity when the other is in
eruption, and becoming quiet when such eruption ceases.
    The specimen of Tunguragua volcanic ash received by me had very
much the same appearance as that of the Cotopaxi ash formerly
examined — a very finely divided powder, of light brownish-grej' or
fawn colour, a little lighter in shade than the Cotopaxi specimen.
Under the microscope the same minute grains and spiculaa were seen,
having for the most part sharp, splintery edges and angles.                The
same general mineralogical character was observed — essentially the
                       " andesite " — with
debris of trachytic                        apparently less difference in the
colour of the felspar present, which was almost all white or colourless,
smd with fewer disseminated particles of magnetite and specular iron.
There were some scales of what was probably comminuted vesicular
pumice.

   The specific gravity was found         = 2-597 at       25°  C., as compared with
water at the same temperature.
   The ash. was fusible, though with difficulty, before the mouth blow
pipe, or in a small platinum spoon or crucible over the blast lamp,
forming a greenish vesicular slag, red on the surface.
   On being boiled with water            it  gave up 0-13 per cent. of soluble
matter.      This portion, soluble in water, consisted mainly of sodium
sulphate and chloride, with a little of the corresponding salts of
potassium and traces of yellowish-brown organic matter.
   Treatment with dilute hydrochloric or even acetic acid produced
quite noticeable effervescence.         On digestion with gentle warming in
rather dilute acetic acid, 3.36 per cent, dissolved, of which 2'83 per
cent, was    calcium carbonate, 0'31 per cent, magnesium carbonate, and
the rest minute amounts of iron, aluminum, and the alkaline salts
soluble in water.
   On being boiled with strong hydrochloric acid the ash (not having
been previously treated with water or acetic acid) dissolved to the
extent of 9'61 per cent., the solution having a dark yellow-brown
colour, due to the presence of iron.
   The material taken as a whole, i.e., without any previons mechanical
•separation of its constituent minerals, and without previous digestion
with water or acid, but dried at 100° C., gave on analysis the following

   On finding the carbonates of calcium and magnesium,                       I  was at first
inclined     to   suspect    that     they   were      merely impurities,      which    had

become mingled with the ash in collecting it fragments of plaster
from a wall, or something of that kind —but from their pretty uniform
distribution, which was ascertained by two or three separate ex
periments, and from their fine state of division, no particles separately
detectable by the naked eye being found, this does not seem likely,
and it is rather to be supposed that these carbonates are present as
minute particles of a magnesian limestone, torn away by the larger
ejected masses from some portion of the inner surface of the crater of
the volcano.         A large part of the silver of South America is said to
occur associated with limestones of Carboniferous age in the Bolivian
and Peruvian Andes, but whether such rocks have been observed to
extend into Ecuador          I   do not know.
   As for the       distinct    trace   of organic matter observed, this may in
part represent ordinary dust swept down from the lower regions of
the atmosphere, but was no doubt partly at least derived from the
cloth on which the volcanic ash is said to have been collected, since
a few cotton fibres were easily identified under the microscope.
   It was proved, as in the case of the ash from Cotopaxi formerly
examined, that the silver present in minute quantity could be dissolved
out by boiling with an aqueous solution of ammonia, or of potassium
cyanide, or of sodium thiosulphate, but was not appreciably extracted
by nitric acid. Hence, as was remarked in the former paper, it seems

most probable that the metal exists           in the ash as silver chloride.      No
other heavy metal than iron and silver could be detected.                 The most
scrupulous care was taken in proving that the silver did not' come
from any of the vessels or reagents employed.
     By carefully made assays, both in the dry and liquid way, it was
found that the silver was present to the extent of about 1 part in
107,200 of the ash, or between a fourth and a third of a Troy ounce to
the ton of 2240 pounds. This is rather a smaller proportion than
was found in the Cotopaxi ash, which contained about 1 part for
83,600, or two-fifths of an ounce per ton.             In both eruptions the fall
of considerable quantities      of ashes   at  points on  the sea coast so distant
from the respective volcanoes as Guayaquil and Bahia de Caraguea
indicates that in the aggregate very large absolute amounts of silver
must have been ejected and dispersed.
     These two appear to be the only cases in which silver has been
 detected among the materials thrown out by volcanoes.                Although the
 fact is well known that the chain of the Andes has for centuries
 yielded this metal in great abundance, it is worthy of notice that, to
 the depths as yet reached by mining work, Ecuador is less rich in
 valuable minerals, and especially the precious metals, than any other
 of the South American States.
 II.     " On the Tension      of Recently        Formed Liquid Surfaces."
          By LOKD RAYLEIGH,          Sec.     R.S.     Received February 13,
          1890.
      It  has long been a mystery why a few liquids, such as solutions of
 soap and saponine, should stand so far in advance                    of others in
 regard to their capability of extension              into   large   and   tolerably
 durable laminae.      The subject was specially considered by Plateau in
  his valuable researches, but with results which cannot be regarded as
  wholly satisfactory.       In his view the question is one of the ratio
  between capillary tension and superficial viscosity.               Some of the
  facts adduced certainly favour a connexion between the phenomena
  attributed to the latter property and capability of extension ; but the
  ''                        " is not
     superficial viscosity              clearly defined, and itself stands in
  need    of explanation.
      It  appears to me that there is much to be said in favour of the
  suggestion of Marangoni* to the effect that both capability of exten
  sion and so-called superficial viscosity are due to the presence upon
   the body of the liquid of a coating or pellicle composed of matter
   whose inherent capillary force is less than that of the mass.                  By

                     Lord Rayleigh.           On the Tension    of        [Mar.   C,
means of variations in this coating, Marangoni explains the indisput
able fact that in vertical soap films the effective tension is different
at various       levels.    Were the tension rigorously constant,           as it is
sometimes inadvertently stated to be, gravity would inevitably assert
itself, and the central parts would fall 16 feet in the first second of
time.      By a self-acting adjustment the coating will everywhere
assume      such thickness as to afford the necessary tension, and thus
any part of the film, considered withont distinction of its various
layers, is in equilibrium.          There is nothing, however, to prevent the
interior layers of a moderately thick film from draining down. But
this motion, taking place as it were between two fixed walls, is com
paratively slow, being much impeded by ordinary fluid viscosity.
    In the case of soap, the formation of the pellicle is attributed by
Marangoni to the action of atmospheric carbonic acid, liberating the
fatty acid from its combination with alkali.                  On the other hand,
Sondhauss* found that the properties of the liquid, and the films
themselves, are better conserved when the atmosphere is excluded by
hydrogen ; and I have myself observed a rapid deterioration of very
dilute solutions of oleate of soda when exposed to the air. In this
case a remedy may be found in the addition of caustic potash.                  It is
to be observed, moreover, that, as has long been known, the capillary
forces are themselves quite capable of overcoming weak chemical
affinities, and will operate in the direction required.
    A strong argument in favour of Marangoni 's theory is afforded by
his observation^ that within very wide limits the superficial tension
of soap solutions, as determined by capillary tubes, is almost
independent of the strength. My purpose in this note is to put
forward some new facts tending strongly to the same conclusion.
    It occurred to me that, if the low tension of soap solutions as com
pared with pure water was due to a coating, the formation of this
coating would be a matter of time, and that a test might be found in
the examination of the properties of the liquid surface immediately
after its formation.        The experimental problem here suggested may
seem difficult or impossible ; but it was, in fact, solved some years
ago in the course of researches upon the Capillary Phenomena of Jets.J
A jet of liquid issuing under moderate pressure from an elongated,
e.g., elliptical, aperture perforated in a thin plate, assumes a chain-like
appearance, the complete period, k, corresponding to two links of
the chain, being the distance travelled over by a given part of the
liquid in the time occupied by a complete transverse vibration of the
column abont its cylindrical configuration of equilibrium.               Since the

phase of vibration depends upon the time elapsed, it is always the
same at the same point in space, and thus the motion is steady in the
hydrodynamical sense, and the boundary of the jet is a fixed surface.
Measurements of      \  under a given head, or velocity, determine the
time of vibration, and from this, when the density of the liquid and the
diameter of the column are known, follows in its turn the value of the
capillary tension (T) to which the vibrations are due.      Cceteris 'paribus,
Toe X-2; and this relation, which is very easily proved, is all that
is needed for our present purpose.          If we wish to see whether a
moderate addition of soap alters the capillary tension of water, we
have only to compare the wave-lengths         \ in the two cases, using the
same aperture and head.          By this method the liquid surface may
he tested hefore  it is y^ second old.
   Since it was necessary to be able to work with moderate quantities
of liquid, the elliptical aperture had to be rather fine, about 2 mm.
by 1 mm.     The reservoir was an ordinary flask, 8 cm. in diameter, to
which was sealed below as a prolongation a (1 cm.) tube bent at
right angles (figs. 1, 2). The aperture was perforated /in thin sheet
brass, attached to the tube by cement.       It was about 15 cm. below the
mark, near the middle of the flask, which defined the position of the
free surface at the time of observation.
   The arrangement for bringing the apparatus to a fixed position,
designed upon the principles laid down by Sir W. Thomson, was
simple and effective.       The body of the flask rested on three pro
tuberances from the      ring of a retort stand, while the neck was held
by  an india-rubber    band  into a V -groove attached to an upper ring.
This provided five contacts.          The necessary sixth contact was
effected by rotating    the  apparatus about its vertical axis until the
delivery tube bore against a stop situated near its free end. The
flask could thus be removed for cleaning without interfering with
the comparability of various experiments.
   The measurements, which usually embraced two complete periods,
could be taken pretty accurately by a pair of compasses with the
assistance of a magnifying glass.       But the double period was some
what small (16 mm.), and the little latitude admissible in respect to
the time of observation was rather embarrassing. It was thus a
great improvement to take magnified photographs of the jet, upon
which measurements could afterwards be made at leisure. In some
preliminary experiments the image upon the ground glass of the
camera was utilised without          actual photography.      Even thus a
decided advantage       was realised in comparison        with the direct
measurements.
   Sufficient illumination was afforded by a candle flame situated a
few inches behind the jet. This was diffused by the interposition of
a piece of ground glass.       The lens was a rapid portrait lens of large

aperture, and the ten seconds needed to produce a suitable impression

                                                  think am right in saying that large
 bubbles could be blown   with the weakest of the solutions experimented upon.

tension dne to oleate requires time for its development.                 According
to the law given above, the ratio of tensions of the newly-formed
surfaces for water and oleate (-go) would be merely as 6 : 5.*
    Whether the slight differences still apparent in the case of the
stronger solutions are due to the formation of a sensible coating in
 less than -t-^ second, cannot be absolutely decided ; but the prob
ability appears to lis in the negative. No distinct differences could be
detected between the first and second wave-lengths ; but this obser
vation is, perhaps, not accurate enough to settle the question.                  It is
possible that a coating may be formed on the surface of the glass and
metal, and that this is afterwards carried forward.
    As a check upon the method,            I thought it desirable to apply it to
the comparison of pure water and dilute alcohol, choosing for the
latter a mixture of 10 parts by volume of strong (not methylated)
alcohol with 90 parts water. The results were as follows : —
              2\ (water) =        38-5,      2\. (alcohol)  = 465,
                h (water)     = 30-0,         h (alcohol)  = 220 ;
but it may be observed that they are not quite comparable with the
preceding for various reasons, such as displacements of apparatus and
changes of temperature.             It is scarcely worth while to attempt an
elaborate reduction of these numbers, taking into account the differ
ences of specific gravity in the two cases ; for, as was shown in the
former paper, the observed values of X are complicated by the
departure of the vibrations from isochronism, when, as in the present
experiments, the deviation from the circular section is moderately
great. We have —
                    (46-5/38-S)8      = 1-46,      30/22  = 1-36  ;
and these numbers prove, at any rate, that the method of wave
lengths is fully competent to show a change in tension, provided that
the change really occurs at the first moment of the formation of the
free surface.
    In view of the great extensibility of saponine films it seemed im
portant to make experiments upon this material also. The liquid
employed was an infusion of horse chestnuts of specific gravity l-02,
and, doubtless, contained other ingredients as well as saponine.                    It
was capable of giving large bubbles, even when considerably diluted
(G times) with water.           Photographs taken on November 23rd gave
the following results :     —
   * Curiously  enough,  I find it already recorded in my note-book of 1879, that \  is
not influenced by the addition to water of soap sufficient to render impossible the
rebound of colliding jets.

               2X (water) = 392,            2\ (saponine) = 395,
                h (water) = 305,             h (saponine)    = 207.
     Thns,   although      the  capillary    heights differ     considerably, the
  tensions at the first moment are almost equal.             In this case then, as
  in that of soap, there is strong evidence that the lowered tension is
  the result of the formation of a pellicle.
     Though not immediately connected with the principal subject of
 this communication, it may be well here to record that I find saponine
 to have no effect inimical to the rebound after mutual collision of jets
  containing it.      The same may be said of gelatine, whose solutions
 froth strongly.        On the other hand, a very little soap or oleate
  usually renders such rebound impossible, but this effect appears to
 depend upon undissolved greasy matter.              At least the drops from a
 nearly vertical fountain of clear solution of soap were found not to
 scatter.*     The rebound of jets is, however, a far more delicate test
 than that of drops.        A fountain of strong saponine differs in appear
 ance   from  one of   water  ; but this effect is due rather to the super
 ficial viscosity, which retards, or altogether prevents, the resolution
 into drops.
    The failure of rebound when jets or drops containing milk or un
 dissolved soap come into collision has not been fully explained ; but
 it is probably connected with the disturbance which must arise when
 a particle of grease from the interior reaches the surface of one of the-
 liquid masses.
    P.S. — I have lately found that the high tension of recently formed
 surfaces of soapy water was deduced by A. Dupre,f as long ago as
 1869, from some experiments upon the vertical rise of fine jets.
Alrhough this method is less direct than that of the present paper,
M. Dupre must be considered, I think, to have made out his case.                It
is remarkable that so interesting an observation should not have
attracted more attention.

or lenticular) ganglion.              By Remak,* Schwalbe,f Marshall,} and
others, the ganglion of the ophthalmicus profundus has been described
as the ciliary ganglion, and this ganglion has frequently been regarded
as the ganglion of the motor oculi nerve, and hence as homologous
 with the Gasserian and other cranial ganglia. The ciliary ganglion
 having been shown by van WijheS to be quite distinct from the
 ganglion of the ophthalmicus profundus, the old view of Arnold has
 been recently revived, and already van Wijhe, Hoffmann, || Onodi.^f
 Dohrn,** and Beardtt have indicated that they regard tho ciliary as
a sympathetic ganglion.              Hoffmann bases his belief on certain ob
servations on the development of the ciliary ganglion in reptiles,
 while Onodi has adopted this view chiefly because in the higher
 vertebrates      the ciliary ganglion receives a communicating branch
 from the sympathetic. But Beard, while considering the ciliary a
 sympathetic ganglion, states that in sharks he has seen nothing in
                  " the mode of
support of                             origin for the ciliary ganglion described
 by Hoffmann," in reptiles.
    Having examined the cranial nerves of a number of Elnsmo-
 branchs at various stages of development and growth,                         I   am now
 able to give an account of the ciliary ganglion and indicate its
 nature and its relations to the motor oculi and other cranial nerves.
 In this note, however, I shall only state the more important results
 obtained, as the subject will be fully dealt with in a further con
 tribution " On the Cranial Nerves of Elasmobranehs."                          In study
 ing the ciliary ganglion in Elasmobranehs I have been specially
 struck with its tendency to vary, not only in the same genus or
 species, bnt in the same individual.                  Of the numerous specimens
 examined, I have only once found the ganglion entirely absent (in an
 adult Raia radiata), while I have occasionally (in Acanthias) found
 two well developed ganglia on each side. Usually in sharks I found
 the ganglion lying in connexion with the inferior branch of the motor
oculi, while in skates it was generally in contact with the ophthalmicus
profundus, or lying midway between the motor oculi and the ganglion
of the profundus. In form the ganglion varies extremely ; rounded or
conical in some cases, in others it was represented by two or three

groups of cells      lying parallel to or in contact with the motor
oculi.
    In some cases ganglionic     cells had wandered from the ganglion n
considerable distance along the ciliary nerves towards the eyeball.
    Although in sharks the ciliary ganglion often lay iu close contact
with the motor oculi nerve, no ganglionic cells were ever found
either in the trunk of that nerve or on any of its branches.             In
skates the ganglion was usually more intimately related with the
ophthalmicus profundus than the oculo-motor. In all cases the ciliary
ganglion had at least two roots, one from the motor oculi, and one or
two from the ophthalmicus profundus.         In skates the profundus root
always proceeded directly from the profundus ganglion, and the pro
fundus ganglion was frequently found to be connected by a com
municating branch with the Gasserian ganglion.
    Both in sharks and skates, in addition to the ciliary nerves from the
ciliary ganglion there were ciliary nerves proceeding from the gang
lion and from the trunk of the profundus, and in some cases large
ganglionic cells had wandered from the profundus ganglion along the
ciliary nerves ; occasionally a few large cells had migrated some dis
tance along the main trunk of the profundus. In all cases the
majority of the cells of the ciliary ganglion were only about half the
size of the cells of the profundus ganglion.
     In skate embryos (B. batis) under two inches in length no indication
of the ciliary ganglion was discovered, and in shark embryos about ten
inches in length the ganglion was frequently represented by small
groups of cells in the vicinity of the inferior branch of the oculo
motor nerve.     In sharks the first steps in the development of the
ganglion were not observed, but in skates it was possible to make out
all the stages. The first indication of the ganglion was in the form
of a slender outgrowth from the inferior border of the large ophthal
micus profundus ganglion, which met and blended with fibres from the
descending branch of the motor oculi. The outgrowth from the pro
fundus ganglion was crowded with cells ; the fibres from the motor oculi,
like its root and trunk, were absolutely destitute of cells. At a some
what later stage the cells had accumulated at the junction of the out
growth from the profundus ganglion with the fibres from the motor
oculi. It looked as if the blending of the two sets of fibres had
formed a network which resisted the further migration of the gang
 lionic cells. In typical cases, at a still later stage, all the ganglionic
 cells had left the outgrowth from the profundus ganglion to form a
rounded mass from which the ciliary nerves took their origin.             In
 some instances some of the fibres which connected the profundus
 ganglion with the Gasserian seemed to reach and end in the ciliary
                                                                             f
 ganglion. It thus appears that the ciliary ganglion stands in the
 same relation to one of the cranial nerves (the ophthalmicus pro-

 fundus)    as the   sympathetic ganglia of the trunk stand to the spinal
 nerves, and that the ciliary ganglion may henceforth be considered a
  sympathetic ganglion.          Further investigations may show that the
  ganglia in connexion with the branches of the trigeminus (fifth)
  nerve may also be considered as belonging to the sympathetic system.
  In conclusion, I may say that I have found the vestiges of the ophthal
  micus profundus ganglion in a five months human embryo lying under
  cover of the inner portion of the Gasserian ganglion, and satisfied my
  self that the ophthalmicus profundus of the Elasmobranch is repre
 sented in man, as suggested by several writers, by the so-called nasal
 branch of the ophthalmic division of the fifth. To, as far as possible,
 clear up the confusion that has arisen from mistaking the ophthal
  micus profundus nerve for a branch of the oculo-motor or of the
  trigeminus nerve, and the ganglion of the ophthalmicus profundus
 for the ciliary ganglion, it might be well in future to speak of the
 profundus as the oculo-nasal nerve and its ganglion as the oculo-nasal
 ganglion.
 IV. " The Cranial Nerves of            the Torpedo.       (Preliminary Note.)"
        By J. C. Ewart, M.D.              Communicated by Professor M.
        Foster, Sec. R.S.          Received February 13, 1890.
     The cranial nerves of the torpedo agree in their general arrange
 ment with those of the skate.* The ophthalmicus profundus occu
 pies the usual position, but its ganglion lies in close contact with the
 Gasserian, and not on a level with the ciliary, ganglion. The trige
 minus has the usual distribution, for, notwithstanding the statements
 in the most recent text-books,t the trigeminus sends no branch to the
electric organ.       The facial complex includes the superficial ophthal
 mic, the buccal, and the byomandibular nerves, all of which have the
same distribution as the corresponding nerves in the skate ; but the
byomandibular includes or is accompanied by a large bundle of nerve
fibres which supply the anterior and inner portion of the electric
organ.      This large nerve cord (the first electric nerve) has hitherto
                       J
almost invariably been described as a branch of the trigeminus. When
traced backwards, it is found to spring from the anterior portion of
the electric lobe.

 to, and as disappearing along with, the nervus trigeminus.

   The glossopharyngeus, a slender nerve in the skate, is represented
in the torpedo by a thick cord which escapes by a large foramen
in the outer wall of the auditory capsule. This large nerve consists
of two portions, one of which is small and completely covered by the
large superficial division.    The small deep division, which in its
course and distribution closely resembles the glossopharyngeal in the
skate, presents on leaving the auditory capsule a distinct ganglionic
swelling, beyond which it breaks up into the branchial and other
branches. The large superficial division emanates from the electric
lobe behind the origin of the first electric nerve, and at once runs
outwards to reach and supply the mnjority of the columns of the
anterior half of the electric organ.
    The vagns complex consists of the nervus lateralis, the rervns in-
testinalis, and of five branchial nerves, of which the two anterior are
accompanied by the third and fourth electric nerves.          The nervus
lateralis, lying superficial to all the other nerves, arises on a level
with the root of the glossopharyngeus, and then curves backwards
dorsal to the posterior electric nerve to reach the canal of the lateral
line. Shortly after leaving the cranium it presents a distinct gan
glionic swelling, which is crowded with large cells. The four bran
chial nerves for the four functional branchife, the slender filament
 which represents a sixth branchial nerve, and the intestinal nerve lie
 at first in contact with each other under cover of the third and fourth
 electric nerves.    When the branchial and intestinal nerves are care-
 fnlly examined, they are found to present four, sometimes five,
 ganglionic enlargements, and in addition ganglionic cells can some
 times be detected at the proximal end of the slender sixth branchial
 nerve. The third and fourth electric nerves lie over and are especially
 related to the second and third branchial nerves. These large electric
 nerves spring from the posterior half of the electric lobe, and find
 their way outwards partly behind and partly under the auditory
 capsule, to terminate in the posterior half of the electric organ.
    It thus appears that all the electric nerves spring from the ejectric
 lobe, that the first accompanies the hyomandibular division of the
 facial complex, the second the glossopharyngeus, and the third and
 fourth the first two branchial nerves of the vagus complex.        It re
 mains to be seen whether the electric nerves have been derived from
 motor branches of the nerves with which they are respectively asso
 ciated by an enormous increase in the number of their fibres, as
 the muscular fibres were gradually transformed into electric plates.

I. "On     the Organisation of the Fossil          Plants   of the Coal-
      measures.    Part XVII." By William Crawford William
      son, LL.D., F.R.S., Professor of Botany in the Owens
      College, Manchester.      Received February 8, 1890.
                                (Abstract.)
   In  1873 the author described     in the ' Phil. Trans.' an interesting
stem of a plant from the Lower Carboniferous beds of Lancashire,
under the name of Lyginodendron Oldhamium.                 He also called
attention to some petioles of ferns, more fully described in 1874
under the name of Rachiopteris aspera. The former of these plants
possessed a highly organised, exogenously developed, xylem zone,
whilst Rachiopteris was only supplied with what looked like
closed bundles.    Since the dates referred to, a large amount of
additional information has been obtained respecting both these
plants. Structures, either not seen, or at least ill-preserved, have
now been discovered, throwing fresh light on their affinities ; but
most important of all is the proof that the Bachiopteris aspera is
now completely identified as the foliar rachis or petiole of the Lygino
dendron ; hence there is no longer room for doubting that, notwith
standing its indisputable possession of an exogenous vascular zone,
the bundles of which exhibit both xylem and phloem elements, along
with medullary and phloem rays, it has been a true Fern.           Though
such exogenous developments       have now been long known to exist
amongst the Calamitean and Lycopodiaceous Ferns, as well as in

  1890.]        of  the Fossil Plants of     the Coal-measures.               2W5
 other plants of the Carboniferous strata, we have had no evidence
 until now that the same mode of growth ever occurred amongst the
 Ferns. Now, however, this Cryptogamic family is shown to be no
 longer an exceptional one in this respect. All the three great divisions
 of the Vascular Cryptogams, the Equisetacese, the Lycopodiacese, and
 the Homosporous Filices of the primaeval world, exhibited the mode
 of growth which is confined, at the present day, to the Angio-
 spermous plants. A further interesting feature of the life of this
 Lyginodendron is seen in the history of the development of its con
 spicuous medulla. In several of his previous memoirs, notably in his
 Part VI, the author has demonstrated a peculiarity in the origin of
 the medulla of the Sigillariau and Lepidodendrian plants.              Instead of
 being   a conspicuous   structure   in the  youngest   state  of  the  stems and
 branches of these plants, as it is in the recent Ferns, and as in most of
 the living Angiosperms, few or no traces of it are observable in these
 fossil Lycopodiaceee.     In them it develops itself in the interior of an
 apparently    solid  handle    of tracheal (within which doubtless some
 obscure cellular germs must be hidden), but ultimately it becomes a
 large and conspicuous organ.         The author has now ascertained that a
 similar medulla is developed, in precisely the same way, within a
 large vascular bundle occupying the centre of the very young twigs
 of the Lyginodendron. But in this latter plant other phenomena
 associated with this development make its history even yet more
 clear and indisputable than in the case of the Lycopods.              The entire
 history of these anomalous developments adds a new chapter to our
 records of the physiology of the vegetable kingdom.
    Further light is also thrown upon the structure of the Heterangium
 Grievii, originally described in the author's memoir, Part IV. This
plant presents many features in its structure suggesting that it too
will ultimately prove to be a Fern. The specimens described in the
above memoir, published in 1873, all possessed a more or less
developed exogenous xylem zone.            But the author has now obtained
other examples in which no such zone exists.               It is clear therefore
that in this, as well as in so many others of the fossil Cryptogams
of the Coal-measures,       this exogenous development is a secondary
phenomenon     — a product of a more advanced stage of growth.                 In
their younger states all these plants seem to approach nearer to their
recent representatives than they do in their later stages of growth.
   The author has now discovered the stem of a genus of plants
(Boiemanites) , hitherto known only by some fruits, the detailed
                                                                          '
organisation of which was originally described by him in the Trans
actions of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester,' in
1871.     The structure of this new stem corresponds closely with what
is seen in Sphenophyllum           and in some forms of Asterophyllites
              '
(Memoir V,      Phil.  Trans.,'  1874, p. 41, et seq.).  This discovery makes

296           Dr. P. F. Fraukland and Mrs. Frankland.          [Mar. 13,
an addition to our knowledge of the great Calamarian family,           to
which the plant obviously belongs.
   Further demonstrations are also given by the author, illustrating
some features in the history of the true Calamites. Attention is
called to the fact that, whilst the large, longitudinally-grooved and
furrowed inorganic casts of the central medullary cavities of these
plants are extremely common, we never find similar casts of the
smaller branches.      The cause of this is demonstrated in the memoir.
In these young twigs the centre of the branch is at first occupied by
a parenchymatous medulla.            The centre of this medulla becomes
absorbed     at a  very early age, leaving the beginnings of a small
fistular cavity in its place ; but, if any plastic mud or sand entered
this cavity when the plant was submerged, the surface of such a cast
would exhibit no longitudinal groovings, because there would be
nothing in the remaining medullary cells surrounding the cast to
produce such an effect. It was only when the further growth of the
branch was accompanied by a more complete absorption of the
remaining medullary cells, causing the cavity thus produced to be
bounded by the inner wedge-shaped angles of the longitudinal
vascular bundles constituting the xylem zone, that such an effect
could be produced.         After that change any inorganic substance
finding   its  way  into the  interior of this cavity, had its surface so
moulded by the wedges as to produce the superficial longitudinal
ridges and furrows so characteristic of these inorganic casts.
II. "The Nitrifying        Process and its Specific Ferment."         By
       Percy F. Frankland, Ph.D., B.Sc. (Lond.), A.R.S.M., &c.,
      Professor of Chemistry in University College, Dundee, and
       Grace C. Frankland.               Communicated by Professor
       Thorpe, F.R.S. Received February 28, 1890.
                                  (Abstract.)
   The process of nitrification has been practically studied for cen
turies, but it was first in the year 1878 that it was shown by
Schloesing and Miintz to be dependent upon the presence of certain
minute forms of life, or micro-organisms, or in other words to be a
fermentation change.
   The authors have been engaged during the last three years in en
deavouring to isolate the nitrifying organism, and the present memoir
gives in detail an account of the numerous experiments which were
made in this direction.
   Nitrification, having been in the first instance induced in a par
ticular aminoniucal solution by means of a small quantity of garden

 1890.]     The   Nitrifying Process and its Specific Ferment.        297
soil,   was  carried on through twenty-four generations, a minute
quantity on the point of a sterilised needle being introduced from one
nitrifying solution to the other. From several of these generations,
gelatine-plates were poured and the resulting colonies inoculated into
identical ammoniacal solutions, to see if nitrification would ensue ;
but, although these experiments were repeated many times, on no
occasion were they successful.
   It appeared, therefore, that the nitrifying organism either refused
to grow in gelatine, or that the authors had failed to find it, or that,
growing in gelatine, it refused to nitrify after being passed through
this medium.
   Experiments were, therefore, commenced to endeavour to isolate
the organism by the dilution method. For this purpose a number of
series of dilutions were made by the addition to sterilised distilled
water of a very small quantity of an ammoniacal solution which had
nitrified.   It was hoped that the attenuation would be so perfect that
ultimately the nitrifying organism alone wonld be introduced.
   After a very large number of experiments had been made in this
direction the authors at length succeeded in obtaining an attenuation
tronsisting of about tsoooo? °f the original nitrifying solution em
ployed, which not only nitrified, but on inoculation into gelatine-
peptone refused to grow, and was seen under the microscope to
consist of numerous characteristic bacilli hardly longer than broad,
which may be described as bacillo-cocci.
   These results are the more striking, for in the case of the two
other bottles similarly diluted, one had not nitrified, but on inocula
tion into gelatine-peptone produced a growth already on the second
day, whilst the remaining bottle not only produced a growth, but
had also nitrified, thus clearly showing that the number of
organisms had been reduced to two, i.e., one which nitrified and did
not grow in gelatine, and another which had nothing to do with
nitrification, but which grew in gelatine.    In the case where nitrifica
tion took place and a growth also appeared in the gelatine-tube, it
was obvious that both the nitrifying and non-nitrifying organisms,
were present. These inoculation tests, together with the microscopical
appearances, were confirmed by repeated experiments with invariably
the same results.
   It is, however, very remarkable that, although this bacillo-coccus
obstinately refuses to grow in gelatine when inoculated from these
dilute media, yet in broth it produces a very characteristic growth,
which, although slow in commencing, often requiring three weeks
before it makes its appearance, is very luxuriant.
   The authors have, moreover, been successful in inducing nitrifica
tion in ammoniacal solutions inoculated from such broth cultivations,
the extent of which has been quantitatively determined.

   Although microscopically its form differs slightly when grown in
broth and the ammoniacal solution respectively, yet its identity was
established beyond question by its returning to its characteristic
baoillo-coccus form when grown again in the ammoniacal solution.
   The authors have also been able to induce its tardy growth in
gelatine-peptone by passing it first through broth cultivations.
   The paper is accompanied by carefully executed drawings of the
nitrifying organism when grown in the various media employed.

                                      [Platb   9.]
   The mean diurnal variability of temperature has been the subject
                                                            '
of several     papers which ha\e appeared in the Zeitschrift der Oest.
Gesells. fiir Meteorologie,' and elsewhere.              Of these the most im
          is  that       Dr. Julius    Hann,    entitled "
portant              by                                    Untersuchungen iiber
die Veranderlichkeit der Tagestemperatur."*                This paper contained,
for ninety stations, distributed over the earth's surface, the mean
diurnal variability of temperature — that is, the mean difference of the
temperature of each day from that of the next — and also the frequency
of a variation of 2° C., 4° C., 6° C., &c., in each month.                Dr. Hann
also investigated for a few stations the probability of a change of
2° C. and of 4° C.
   In the case of some of the stations taken by Dr. Hann the figures
compared were not daily means, but actual readings at corresponding
hoars on successive days.          In such cases the results for variability

 304            Mr. It. II. Scott.   The Variability  of the  [Alar. 27,
naturally come out higher than when means for the whole day are
taken.
    The only British stations among the ninety were Makerstoun for
five years, 1842-46, and Oxford for ten years, 1860-70 (the year 186'J
 being omitted). The Makerstoun means were obtained from different
combinations of hours in different years, and the Oxford figures from
 twelve bi-hourly readings of the thermograph curves.
    Inasmuch as daily mean temperatures derived from twenty-four
 hourly measurements of the thermograms exist at the Meteorological
 Office for the seven observatories during the period of their continu
ance, the fifteen years 1869-83 inclusive, it seemed desirable to dis
 cuss this amount of material so as to exhibit the results for these
islands as an instance of a typically insular climate.
    The method followed has been to extract the differences between
 the successive daily means, irrespective of sign, and then to take the
average of the figures so obtained for each month.
    The mean of these fifteen monthly values gives the mean monthly
variability from the station, and this is shown in Table I.
   I  have appended to the tables the values given by Hann for Oxford
and Makerstoun, as well as for three Continental stations, as speci
mens of excessive variability, and finally those for Georgetown,
Demerara, as exhibiting the great constancy of temperature in that
tropical locality. The last-named figures are the result of six years'
observations, probably by P. Sandeman, though that is not expressly
stated.
   It will be seen at once that the figures for our seven observatories
are much lower than those for either Oxford or Makerstoun.          This
may possibly be due to the fact that the periods for those two records
are both of them less than fifteen years, and they are not equal to each
other or synchronous.
   The contrast between the British stations and the three stations of
Vienna, St. Petersburg, and Barnaul is very remarkable, as is also,
in the other direction, that with Georgetown, where the average on
the whole year is only l"'l F.
   Dealing with our own returns, it will be seen that the mean annual
difference is greatest (2°-7) at Kew : then follow Armagh, Glasgow,
and Stonyhurst with 2C'5, Aberdeen with 2°.4, and the list is closed
by Falmouth and Valencia with 1°'9.
   The annual range of these differences is very similar at all the
seven stations, reaching a maximum in December and a minimum in
August.     The chief exceptions to this assertion are that at Kew the
maximum of 3°-3 occurs in January and November, not in December,
and that at the two south-western observatories,          Falmouth and
Valencia, the minimum is in July.
   The highest absolute figure in any month is 5°-4, for Glasgow

306             Mr. R. H. Scott.          The Variability       of  Hie       [Mar. 27,
in November, 1880, and the lowest,                  0o,7,  for Valencia         in July,
1879.
   In  the detailed table at the end of this section, Table             III,   the mean
values for each month will         be found.
   It  has been suggested         that it would be important to investigate
as to whether temperature changes in these islands show more sudden
pos'tive than negative alterations. In Hindostan (Calcutta and
                                     '
Lahore) Mr. Blanford, in his Climate and Weather of India,' p. 12,
states that there   " rapid falls of temperature are between two and three
times as frequent as rises, and, on the whole, greater in amount."i
   A preliminary inquiry as to all the changes during a month led to
no decisive result, the number of + signs and of — signs being nearly
equal.    It therefore seemed beat to take only the changes exceeding
5°, and, further, to mark specially those above 10°, 15°, and 20° re
spectively.
   The following table, Table II, gives the total number of changes
exceeding 5° during the entire series of years, with the mean amount
of the change arranged in two sets of two columns each, marked
R. and F. for rise and fall. Underneath these figures is given the
number of changes exceeding 10°, &c., but without mean values.

   It will  be Been that at every observatory except Glasgow the total
 number of rises exceeding 5° is greater than that of falls of the same
amount, and also that the mean value of the rises exceeds that of the
falls, except at Aberdeen, where the two numbers are equal.
   Accordingly, in these islands we have the opposite conditions to
those  prevailing in India, and sudden rises of temperature are more
frequent and of greater amount than sudden falls.
   The same fact, as regards frequency, comes out, with two slight
exceptions, as regards changes exceeding 10°.
   The instance exceeding 20° at Aberdeen deserves some notice.                It
occurred December 16, 1882, and was a rise of 23°¦8.              On that day
at Braemar, not far from Aberdeen, the thermometer stood at 9 a.m.
440,2 higher than at the corresponding hour on the previous day, the
respective readings being — 8"¦3 and 35°'9. It is remarkable that this
excessive change of temperature was very local, for at Dundee the
difference between the successive 9 a.m. readings was only 28°'9, and
at Glasgow the difference between the successive daily mean tempeia-
tures was only 12°-6, or more than 11° less than at Aberdeen.
   We next come to deal with the figures for frequency in Table             III.

These are obtained by arranging the changes, .irrespective of sign,
according to their magnitude. Six subdivisions were made 0" — 0°1<,
l°-0— 4°-9, 5°-0—  9°-9, 10°-0— 14°-9, 15°0— 19°'9, 20°-0— 24°-9.
   The first two of these subdivisions, taken together, cover the same
range of five degrees as any one of the others, but, inasmuch as by
far the greater number of changes were below 5o,0, it seemed to be
worth while to ascertain how many fell short of one degree.
   The total numbers were then divided by 15, the number of years,
so as to obtain the mean monthly number of changes in each sub
division.   The total of the figures for each month amounts to the
number of days in the month.
   It will be seen throughout the table how the range of changes is
least at the two Atlantic stations, Falmouth and Valencia.
   In every month and at every station the mean number of changes
between lo-0 and 4°¦9 exceeds one-half of the number of days in the
month. At Valencia, in July , the changes below lo-0 nearly equal
those between 1°0 and 4c-9, the figures being 14O,6 and 15°"9 respec
tively.

   Taking the winters, we see that Stonyhurst had in the severe
winter of 1881 four days in January on which the mean tempera
ture did not reach 20°, and had 19 days in all in that month in which
the mean temperature did not rise to the freezing point.
   In the same month the number of days with a mean below 32° was
higher (21) than at Stonyhurst both at Aberdeen and Glasgow, but
the cold was not so intense at these stations as at Stonyhurst, for the
number of days with a mean below 20°-0 was less.
   Neither at Falmouth nor at Valencia did the mean ever fall
below 20°-0.
   Conversely, as regards higher temperatures, Kew far outstrips the
other stations, July showing in the interval of 15 years 35 days on
which the mean temperature amounted to 70°.0 or upwards.

 362        Temperature    of the British Isles, 1869—1883.    [Mar. 27,
    It  Beemed   of interest to exhibit these figures graphically, and
 Plate 9, illustrating them, has been drawn. All the curves are not
 shown.     Those for Valencia and Falmouth agree so closely, except in
 July and August, that one line will represent both for most of the
 year.    Similarly, the curves for Armagh, Glasgow, and Stonyhurst
 agree   so exactly in every month that one line suffices to represent
 them.
    I  have therefore shown on the diagram four curves for all the
months, and five for July and August.        The curves represent respec
tively (1) Aberdeen, (2) Kew, (3) Armagh, Glasgow, or Stonyhurst,
 (4) Valencia or Falmouth, and (5) Falmouth alone, in the two
months specified.
   In the diagrams the abscissee represent temperatures and the
ordinates the number of days during which those temperatures were
experienced.
   It will be noticed that the line representing Aberdeen lies generally
on the left hand of the other lines, showing that the lower tempera
tures are most prevalent at that, the most northern station under
consideration.     In all but the summer months the curves for the two
south-western observatories show decided peaks, corresponding to
temperatures between 40° and 50° in winter and between 50° and 603
in summer, while at all the other stations the maxima are not so
marked.
   The difference between Valencia and Falmouth in August is par
ticularly striking, the figures from 40° to 50° and from 50° to 60°
being exactly reversed, Falmouth showing 18'3 days of the higher
and Valencia of the lower temperature.
   The two months July and August exhibit the chief material
difference in climate between the south-west of Ireland and the south
of Cornwall — a difference to the advantage of the latter.
   We also see from Table V that at both of these south-western
stations the mean daily temperature in July never falls below 50°,
and never rises above 70°. This amount of equability of temperature
is approached, but not quite reached, at several other stations in the
same month. At several of the observatories the range of daily mean
temperature in winter exceeds forty degrees.
   The outcome of the entire enquiry is that, as regards the 15 years
under consideration, both (1) the variability of temperature, as
defined in the beginning of the paper, and (2) the range of mean
temperature, are least at Valencia and Falmouth, the two stations
most exposed to the influence of the Atlantic Ocean.        Then follows
Aberdeen, which, from its close proximity to the sea, enjoys a more
equable climate than might have been anticipated from its latitude.
   The three stations of Glasgow, Stonyhurst, and Armagh form a
third group, and they only differ inter se in unimportant particulars.

 Kew comes last, as the most continental position, with the greatest
variability and the highest amount of range. This latter is due to
the greater prevalence of high temperatures      therfc than elsewhere.
III.   " The Rupture of Steel by Longitudinal Stress." By Chas.
      A. Carus-WilsoN.          Communicated by Professor G. H.
      Darwin, F.R.S. Received March 10, 1890.
                                (Abstract.)
   This paper gives an account of experiments        made with a view to
determining the nature of the resistance that has to be overcome in
order to produce rupture in a steel bar by longitudinal stress.
   The stress required to produce rupture is in every case computed
by dividing the load on the specimen at the moment of breaking by
the contracted area at the fracture measured after rupture ; this stress
                                       "
is called the " true tensile strength    of the material.
   It is well known that any want of uniformity in the distribution of
the stress over the ruptured section causes the bar to break at a
lower stress than it would if the stress was uniformly distributed.
Hence anything that causes want of uniformity is prejudicial ; for
instance, a groove turned in a cylindrical steel bar will produce want
of uniformity, and will consequently be prejudicial, the stress at rup
ture being lower according as the angle of the groove is more acute.
The most favourable condition of test might appear to be that iu
which a bar of uniform section throughout its length was allowed to
draw out freely before breaking, since in this case the stress must
be most uniformly distributed.
   Experiment, however, shows that the plain bar is not always the
strongest. So long as the want of uniformity of stress is consider
able, owing to the groove being cut with a very sharp angle, the
plain bar is stronger than the grooved bar ; but, if the groove be semi
circular instead of angular, the grooved bar is considerably stronger
than the plain, in spite of the fact that the stress is more uniformly
distributed in the latter.
   It would seem, then, that we can strengthen a bar over any given
section by adding material above and below it, the change in section
being gradual ; but such an addition of material cannot strengthen
the bar if rupture is caused by a certain intensity of tensile stress
over the ruptured section ; the added material cannot increase the re
sistance of the ruptured section to direct tensile stress, but it can
increase the resistance to the shearing stress.
   The resistance of a given section of a steel bar does not, then,
depend on its section at right angles to the axis, but on its section at

364         Lord Rayleigh.      Amount     of Oil   necessary to     [Mar.  27,
45° to the axis, for in that direction the shearing stress is a maximum.
From this it would seem that the resistance overcome at rupture is
the resistance of tHe steel to shear.
   Experiments were made to see whether the resistance of steel to
direct shearing bore to its resistance to direct tension the ratio re
quired by the above theory ; since the greatest shearing stress is equal
to one-half the longitudinal stress, we should expect to find the resist
ance to direct shearing equal to one-half of the resistance to direct
tension.
   A series of experiments were made with the result that the ulti
mate resistance to direct shearing was within, on the average. 3 per
cent, of the half of that to direct tension.
   The appearance of the fracture of steel bars is next discussed. It
would appear that when the stress is uniformly distributed in the
neighbourhood of the ruptured section, the fracture is at 45° to the
axis, the bar having sheared along that plane which is a plane of
least resistance to shear.   The tendency to rupture along a plane of
shear may be masked by a non-uniform distribution of stress.
   Two plates of photographs are added, showing examples of steel
bars broken by shearing under longitudinal stress.
IV. " Measurements of        the Amount      of Oil necessary iu order       to
      check the Motions of Camphor upon Water."                     By Lord
      Rayleigh, Sec. R.S.        Received March 10, 1890.
   The motion upon the surface of water of small camphor scrapings,
a phenomenon which had puzzled several generations of inquirers,
was satisfactorily explained by Van der Mensbrugghe,* as due to the
diminished surface-tension of water impregnated with that body. In
order that the rotations may be lively, it is imperative, as was well
shown by Mr. Tomlinson, that the utmost cleanlincss be observed.
It is a good plan to submit the internal surface of the vessel to a
preliminary treatment with strong sulphuric acid. A touch of the
finger is usually sufficient to arrest the movements by communicating
to the surface of the water a film of grease. When the surface-tension
is thus lowered, the differences due to varying degrees of dissolved
camphor are no longer sufficient to produce the effect.
   It is evident at once that the quantity of grease required is exces
sively small, so small that under the ordinary conditions of experiment
it would seem likely to elude our methods of measurement.              In view,
however, of the great interest which attaches to the determination of
molecular magnitudes, the matter seemed well worthy of investiga
tion; and I have found that by sufficiently increasing the water

1890.]        check the Motions of    Camphor upon Water.               3fi5
surface the quantities of grease required           may be   brought  easily
within the scope of a sensitive balance.
   In  the present experiments the only grease tried is olive oil.     It is
desirable that the material ¦which is to be spread out into so thin a
film should be insoluble, involatile, and not readily oxidised, require
ments which greatly limit the choice.
   Passing over some preliminary trials,        I   will now describe the
procedure by     which   the  density  of the   oil  film necessary for the
purpose was determined. The water was contained in a sponge-bath
of extra size, and was supplied to a small depth by means of an india-
rubber pipe in connexion with the tap. The diameter of the circular
surface thus obtained was 84 cm. (33"). A short length of fine
platinum wire, conveniently shaped, held the oil. After each opera
tion it was cleaned by heating to redness, and counterpoised in the
balance. A small quantity of oil was then communicated, and deter
mined by the difference of readings. Two releasements of the beam
were tried in each condition of the wire, and the deduced weights of
oil appeared usually to be accurate to -£§ milligram at least. When
all is ready, camphor scrapings are deposited upon the water at
two or three places widely removed from one another, and enter at
once into vigorous movement.         At this stage the oiled extremity of
the wire is brought cautiously down so as to touch the water. The
oil film advances rapidly across the surface, pushing before it any
dust or camphor fragments which it may encounter. The surface of
the liquid is then brought into contact with all those parts of the
wire upon which oil may be present, so as to ensure the thorough
removal of the latter. In two or three cases it was verified by trial
that the residual oil was incompetent to stop camphor motions upon
a surface including only a few square inches.
   The manner in which the results are exhibited will be best explained
by giving the details of the calculation for a single case, eg., the
second of December 17.       Here 0-81 milligram of oil was found to be
very nearly enough to stop the movements.              The volume of oil in
cubic centimetres is deduced by dividing O00081 by the sp. gr.,
viz., 0.9. The surface over which this volume of oil is spread is
                      \ v X 84s  square centimetres     ;
bo  that the thickness of the oil film, calculated as if its density were
the same as in more normal states of aggregation, is

c onsiderable intervals of time, are collected in the Table. For conve

nience of comparison they are arranged, not in order of date, but in
order of densities of film.
    The sharpest test of the quantity of oil appeared to occur when the
motions were nearly, but not quite, stopped.                    There may be some
little uncertainty as to the precise standard indicated by " nearly
enough," and it may have varied slightly upon different occasions.
But the results are quite distinct, and under the circumstances very
accordant.        The thickness of oil required to take the life out of the
camphor      movements        lies between one and two millionths of a milli
metre, and may be estimated with some precision at 1.6 micro-
millimetre.        Preliminary results from a water surface of less area
are quite in harmony.

thickness of the black parts of soap films was found by Messrs.
Remold and Rilcker to be 12 micro-millimetres.
   An important question presents itself as to how far these water
surfaces may be supposed to have been clean to begin with.                  I believe
that all ordinary water surfaces are sensibly contaminated ; but the
agreement of the results in the Table seems to render it probable that
the initial film was not comparable with that purposely contributed.
Indeed, the difficulties of the experiments proved to be less than had
been expected.         Even a twenty-four hours' exposure to the air of the

1890.]     Stability of a Rotating Spheroid of Perfect Liquid.            367
laboratory* does not usually render a water surface unfit to exhibit
the camphor movements.
   The thickness of the oil films here investigated is of course much
below the range of the forces of cohesion ; and thus the tension of
the oily surface may be expected to differ from that due to a com
plete film, and obtained by addition of the tensions of a water-oil
surface and of an oil-air surface.        The precise determination of the
tension of oily surfaces is not an easy matter.            A capillary tube is
hardly available, as there would          be  no security that the degree of
contamination within the tube was the same as outside.                  Better
results may be obtained from the rise of liquid between two parallel
plates.    Two such plates of glass, separated at the corners by thin
sheet metal, and pressed together near the centre, dipped into the bath.
In one experiment of this kind the height of the water when clean was
measured by 62. When a small quantity of oil, about sufficient to
stop the camphor motions, was communicated to the surface of the
water, it spread also over the surface included between the plates,
and the height was depressed to 48.            Further additions of oil, even
in considerable quantity, only depressed the level to 38.
    The effect of a small quantity of oleate of soda is much greater.
By this agent the height was depressed to 24, which shows that the
tension of a surface of soapy water is much less than the combined
tensions of a water-oil and of an oil-air surface.              According to
 Quincke, these latter tensions are respectively 2-l and 3'8, giving by
addition 5.9 ; that of a water-air surface being 8'3. When soapy
water is substituted for clean, the last number certainly falls to less
 than half its value, and therefore much below 5-9.

 possible to give a complete investigation of the criteria of stability of
 Maclaurin's spheroid when the liquid forming it is free from all traces
 of viscosity, and equilibrium is liable to be broken by a disturbance of
 a perfectly general character. As the problem in question appeared to be
 one of considerable interest, I have, since writing the above paper, put
 the question to the test of numerical calculation in the case of the
 simpler types of disturbance, and the results thus obtained have been
 such as to allow of extension to a perfectly general disturbance.

368                Mr. G. H. Bryan.          On the  Stability   of  a     [Mar. 27,
    On page 210 of my paper, I showed that, if we consider only dis
placements determined by the spheroidal sectorial harmonic of the
Fecond degree, the limit of eccentricity consistent with stability
as obtained from my period-equations agrees with that obtained by
ltiemann* and Basset.f             This, of course, it should do, for the type
of displacement considered in both investigations is the same, viz.,
one in which the deformed surface becomes an ellipsoid, but does not
remain one of revolution.              We thus have a necessary condition for
stability.     But     we   do  not know    that it is a sufficient condition. In
order that this may be so, it is necessary that the critical form thus
obtained shall be stable for all other types of displacement.                     The
object of the present paper is to show that such is, in fact, the case.
Were it otherwise, the limit of eccentricity consistent with stability
would have to be determined afresh. It is needless to remark that we
are here exclusively considering what Poincare' calls
                                                                         " ordinary "
stability, as distinguished from "secular" stability.
    2. The symbols employed in the present paper are the same as in
my former communication, and the results there proved will be here
assumed.       For the sake of convenience, the notation and results
required    for   the present work are collected below, and references to
 the paper in question will be denoted by the letter [E].

   4. To prove that the spheroid is "ordinarily" stable nntil this
critical form is reached, we only have to show that conditions (7),

 sectorial harmonics (n = s) in the Table. Thns in every case in which
 the exact conditions of stability have not been investigated, the
 sufficient condition for secular stability given by the inequality (7) is
 satisfied.   It   remains to apply the criteria (8) and (9) to the cases
 where (7) is    not    satisfied.
    5. First take the case of n = 2, s = 0.
    The fact that px( f ) . g1(£') — p2(r) ¦!£,(£) is negative in the above Table
 does not indicate that the spheroid in question is secularly unstable
 for this particular type of displacement.                  Its meaning is that the
spheroid is more oblate than that form for which the angular velocity
is a maximum. As pointed out in Poincare's memoir,* the disturbed
form is here also a spheroid of revolution, and there is no form of
                 "

    The condition of " ordinary " stability, from inequality (8) is

    For the particular value of            f considered,    the left-hand     member of
this inequality is
             =   -    -0249 + §(-3456)       =  - -0249 + -2304      = -2055,

the foregoing table, except that for which it is, by hypothesis,

  7.  On examining the values of /«*(f) . «'*(f) given in the Table, it
appears probable that as we proceed to harmonics of higher degrees
this product diminishes in value, and that condition (7) is satisfied
universally in all the cases not considered above.       That such is
actually the case we now proceed to demonstrate.     The results are a
slight extension of those obtained in § 10 of Poincare's paper, the

by , and the quotient will be (l^ + iy'x a rational algebraic function

   11.    We have to consider two cases: —
   I.   Suppose n = m. Then condition (11) will be satisfied, for all
values of f, provided that r > s. Therefore ft,r(£) ,«'''(?) is always

the sectorial harmonics).
   II. Suppose n— s = m— r and, therefore,              n— m = s—r.        Condition
(11) may     be   written —

   Thus the sufficient condition of secular stability is satisfied for all
types of displacement, with the exceptions already considered in which
the "ordinary "conditions of stability have been proved to hold good.
Hence the results of the present paper prove conclusively that
Maclaurin's spheroid, if formed of perfectly inviscid liquid, will be abso
lutely stable if its eccentricity be less tlian 0'9528867.            If the eccentricity
exceed this limit, the spheroidal form toill become unstable, and the liquid
tcill assume the form of an ellipsoid.
   13. The state of steady motion which then ensues is intermediate
between the forms known as Jacobi's and Dedekind's ellipsoids.
               "
The " spin of the liquid will be everywhere constant and equal, say,
to w, and the form of the liquid free surface will be an ellipsoid,
whose principal axes rotate about the least axis with angular velocity
\w. That this is initially the case is in accordance with the
                                                                                 results,
of [E, §§ 14, 18], supposing that the roots of the period-equation
become complex, for their real part will indicate that the disturb
ance travels round with angular velocity £w.                     It is unnecessary to
discuss this point at greater length here.
   It is also to be noted that the results of the present paper quite
preclude the possibility, under ordinary circumstances, of Maclaurin's
spheroid ever passing into the form of one or more rings of rotating
liquid.    This might probably take place if we imagined the liquid
surface constrained to remain a figure of revolution.                   Bat such hypo

                                (Abstract.)
   The experiments made by one of us in 1883 having giveu a value
for " v " considerably smaller than those found in several recent
researches on this subject, it was thought desirable to repeat the
experiments.     The method used in 1883 was to find both the
electrostatic and the electromagnetic measures of the capacity of a
condenser, the electrostatic measure         being calculated from the
dimensions of the condenser, and the electromagnetic measure by
determining a resistance which would produce the same effect as that
produced by repeated charging of the condenser when placed in one
arm of a Wheatstone's bridge. In the experiments in 1883 the
condenser used in determining the electromagnetic measure was not the
same as that for which the electrostatic capacity had been calculated,
but one without a guard ring, the equality of the capacity of this
condenser and the guard ring condenser being tested by the method
                      '
given in Maxwell's Electricity and Magnetism,' vol. 1, p. 324.
   In repeating the experiments we adopted at first the same method
as before, using, however, a key of different design for testing the
equality of the condensers by Maxwell's method.             We got very
consistent results, practically identical   with those obtained in 1883.
We may mention here, since it has been suggested that the capacity
of the leads might explain the low value of " v " obtained previously,
that the leads are allowed for by the way the comparison between the
two condensers is made, for the same leads are used in the determina
tion of the electromagnetic measure of the capacity of the auxiliary
condenser and in the comparison of the capacity of this condenser
with the one with the guard ring, and the capacity of the auxiliary
condenser is adjusted until its capacity, plus that of the leads, equals
the capacity of the guard ring condenser ; and in the electromagnetic
measurements it is the capacity of the auxiliary condenser, plus that
of its leads, which is found.

 1890.]    Ratio of Electromagnetic Unit       to  Electrostatic Unit.   377
   As the use of the auxiliary condenser introduces additional sources
of error, we endeavoured to determiue the electromagnetic            measure
of the capacity of the guard ring directly, using a complicated
commutator, which worked both the guard ring and condenser.              The
first commutator we used was one where the contacts were made by
 platinum styles attached to a tuning fork ; the results obtained with
this were not so regular as we desired, so we replaced the tuning
fork commutator by a rotating one driven by a water motor.                 A
stroboscopic arrangement was attached to the commutator, which
enabled its speed to be measured and kept constant.               With this
arrangement, which worked perfectly, we got values for the electro
magnetic measure of the capacity of the condenser distinctly less
than those obtained by the old method.             We then endeavoured to
find out the reason for this difference,         and after a good deal of
trouble discovered that in the experiments by which the equality of
the capacities of the guard ring and auxiliary condensers were tested
the guard ring did not produce its full effect.        When the guard ring
of the standard condenser was removed and the capacity of the
auxiliary condenser made the same, the two methods gave identical
 results, but the effect produced by adding the guard ring was less in
the old method than in the new.         We found by calculation that the
effect produced by the addition of the guard ring in the old method
was distinctly too small, while in the new the observed and calculated
effects   agreed well together. As the new method was working
perfectly satisfactorily, and as it possesses great advantages over the
old one, inasmuch as we get rid entirely of the auxiliary condenser,
and, since the commutator is a rotating one, its speed can be altered
with much greater ease and accuracy than can be done with a tuning
fork, we discarded the old method and adopted the new one.

    It is well known that by stimulating the sympathetic nerve in the
neck the following effects can be produced : — (1) Retraction of the
nictitating membrane ; (2) protrusion of the eyeball and opening of
the eye; (3) turning the eye, if previous to stimulation the optic axis
is directed nasally, so that the optic axis is directed straight forwards,
or it may be forwards and a little outwards ; (4) dilation of the pupil ;
 (5) constriction of the small arteries of the ear, conjunctiva, and of
various other parts of the head ; (6) in the dog, dilation of the small
arteries of tha gums, lips, and of some other parts of the head ;
 (7) secretion of saliva.
    We have shown that the superior cervical ganglion contains nerve
cells, interpolated in the course of the nerve fibres concerned in produc
ing all the above effects, and, further, that these nerve cells are readily
paralysed by nicotin.*            In this paper we consider the question
whether the nerve cells are paralysed simultaneously or in a definite
order.     That different classes of nerve cells are in some cases un
equally affected by nicotin has been already shown by one of us
 (L., op. cit.), in so far that in the cat the secretory nerve cells on the
course of the cervical sympathetic are more readily paralysed than the
secretory nerve cells on the course of the chorda tympani ; that in the
dog the reverse is the case ; and, lastly, that the nerve cells on the
course of the secretory fibres of the chorda tympani are paralysed
before those on the course of its vaso-dilator fibres.
    The method employed has been to inject nicotin into a vein, (a) in
successive doses, the first dose being rather less than that required
to produce complete paralysis of the cervical sympathetic,               and to
note the order in which the effects normally produced by stimulating
 the sympathetic disappear ; (6) in quantities sufficient to cause com
plete paralysis of the cervical sympathetic, and by stimulating it at
short intervals to note the order of recovery of the normal effects of
such stimulation.
    Of course, by injecting the alkaloid into the blood, the peripheral
nerve endings, as well as the nerve cells of the superior cervical
ganglion, are exposed to its action ; but since, as we have shown

  (op. cit.), even large doses of nicotin* do not prevent the normal
  sympathetic effect from being obtained on stimulating peripherally
  of the superior cervical ganglion ; any absence of the normal effect of
  stimulating the sympathetic in the neck which may be cansed by a
  small dose of nicotin must be due to the action of the alkaloid on the
  nerve cells of the ganglion.
       The method of injecting nicotin into a blood vessel is preferable to
  that of applying dilute Dicotin to the ganglion itself (although this has
  the advantage of limiting the effect to the ganglion), because of the
  difficulty of applying the nicotin in such a way as to make certain
  that equal amounts reach all the nerve cells ; by the latter method it
  might be possible for the external cells of the ganglion to be paralysed
  and the internal cells to have escaped paralysis.
       In the course of our experiments we have naturally had frequent
  occasion to observe the effect of stimulating the sympathetic upon the
  blood supply of the lips and gums.               It will be convenient to discuss
  this action before proceeding to the more immediate object of our
  experiments.
      Effect of Stimulating the Sympathetic upon the Bucco-labial Ee,sion.
                                                                                       —
  The discovery in the sympathetic of the dog of vaso-dilator fibres for
  the lips, gums, and of some other parts of the head is due to Dastre
  and Morat.f        The whole region in which dilation is produced they
  call the bucco-facial region ; this includes the mucous membrane of
  the    nose,   hard    palate,   of the gums, lips, and the neighbouring
  cutaneous regions.          On the other hand, the same stimulus produces
  constriction of the small arteries in the epiglottis, tonsils, and soft
  palate.     Bochefontaine and VulpianJ observed, that sometimes the
  dilation was preceded by a constriction.                 Dastre and Morat§ later
  found a similar constriction ; they state that it occurs only with a
  certain strength of current, which is a little less than that required
'
  to produce primary dilution, so that, when electric shocks cause eou-
  striction before the dilation, no effect is produced if the shocks are
  made a little weaker, and primary dilation is produced if they are
  made a little stronger.
       In our experiments, the variation in the strength of the shocks
      * In a recent experiment upon a rabbit 1 150 mgm. of nicotin were injected into a
  vein without causing the heart to stop. Stimulation of the filament running from
  the superior cervical ganglion to the internal carotid, i.e., stimulation of the sympa
  thetic peripherally of the ganglion, still caused dilation of the pupil. As the experi
  ments in this paper show, 5 to 10 mgm. of nicotin are sufficient to prevent stimulation
  of the sympathetic in the neck, i.e., of the sympathetic centrally of the ganglion,
  i rom producing any effect on the pupil.

capable of producing primary contraction was much greater than that
given by Dastre and Morat. On gradually increasing the strength of
the shocks we find with minimal shocks a slight paling of the lips and
gums, which only slowly disappears, so that the original pinkish
atate of the mucous membrane is not regained for one to two minutes
after the end of the stimulation. As the shocks are gradually in
creased in strength the paling becomes more marked, and the after-
paling of less duration ; with a certain increase in the strength of
shocks, the paling continues for a short time after the stimulation,
and then gives way to a slight flushing ; with further increase, the
duration of the after-paling diminishes and the after-flush increases,
so that soon the pallor gives way, even during the continuance ot
the stimulation, to intense flushing. After this, a slight further in
crease in the strength of the shocks causes primary flushing.                  Marked
flashing is first produced in the anterior part of the lips and gums ;
a stronger current is required to produce it in the posterior part of
the lips and gums and in the hard palate.
    We have found a primary pallor with very considerable variation
in the strength of the current. Thus in one case primary flushing
was first obtained with the index of the secondary coil at 9 cm. from
the primary coil ; with the secondary coil at 18 cm., a slight, though
distinct, pallor was produced ; moreover, the after-flush produced by
the stronger stimulus was considerably shortened by applying to the
nerve the weaker stimulus. In another case the secondary coil was
gradually shifted in successive stimulations from 20 cm. to 6 cm.
distance from the primary.           In all the first effect was pallor ; with the
weaker stimuli this alone was obtained.* The shocks with the
secondary coil at 6 cm. could scarcely be borne on the tongue ; with
the secondary        coil at about     15   cm. they could not be felt on the
tongue.
   Although some of the results which we have just mentioned do
not agree with those of Dastre and Morat, we wish to point out that
they do not conflict with, but rather confirm, the main contention of
these observers, viz., that the sympathetic contains both vaso-con-
strictor and vaso-dilator fibres for the bucco-labial region.
   And from the unequal effects of a moderately strong stimulus on
the different parts of the bucco-facial region, we may conclude that
the proportion of constrictor and dilator fibres for the different parts
   * Laffont (' Soc. de Biologie,' 1880, p. 341), on stimulating the uncut vago
sympathetic in an atropinised dog, found with all strengths of stimulation primary
constriction followed by dilation, the primary constriction being briefer the stronger
the stimulation.     Apparently, however, the paralysis of the inhibitory fibres of the
vagus  by  the atropin given was assumed, and actual observation on the point omitted ;
and Dastre ('Soc. de Biologie,' 1880, p. 348) attributes the previous pallor obtained
on stimulating    the sympathetic to a slowing or cessation of the heart-beat.

of the region is not the same ; and from the nneqnal effects on
different dogs we may probably conclude that the proportion of the
two kinds of nerve fibres varies somewhat in different individuals,
although it is possible that the results on which this conclusion is
based may be caused by a temporary variation in the condition of the
animal, for example, in the amount of anaesthetic given.
   It was noticed by Bochefontaine and Vnlpian and also by Dastre
and Morat that in the cat and rabbit pallor, and not flushing, of the
bucco-labial region is caused by stimulating the cervical sympathetic.
Like these observers, we have not seen primary flushing with any
strength of stimulus; the pallor is marked, except when, for any
reason, the gums and lips are already pale ; as a rule there is no
marked after-flush, but the mucous membrane slowly regains its
normal tint. On repeated stimulation of the sympathetic the bucco-
labial region remains pale and shows very little alteration.                  In the
course of our experiments upon the dog, we had occasionally seen a
slight paling or flushing in the lips and gums on the side opposite to
that on which the sympathetic was stimulated ; in the cat and rabbit
we have paid more attention to this effect, and we find that in these
animals, stimulation of the sympathetic produces a bilateral effect.
The pallor on the opposite side to that on which the nerve is stimu
lated is greater in the rabbit than in the cat, and is more obvious in
the gum of the anterior part of the lower jaw than elsewhere.                      The
degree of the pallor on the opposite side varies considerably in different
individuals.       Occasionally in the rabbit the pallor is complete on
both sides, but in most cases it is much more marked on the side on
which the nerve is stimulated. The bilateral action occurs with either
sympathetic, although it may be more marked with one sympathetic
than with the other ; it occurs with all strengths of currents that
produce any effect ; it is best seen at the beginning of an experiment,
for after repeated stimulation of the sympathetic the paling on the
opposite side becomes less distinct, and it is much better seen in the
anterior than in the posterior part of the lips and gums.                      In the
rabbit a little care must be taken not to stretch the lips too much
during the experiment, since this of itself may cause some pallor in
the gums.       We have also seen some bilateral pallor in the tongue,
especially in the tip on stimulation of one sympathetic ; but we have
paid attention to this in a few experiments only.

   We may mention that, notwithstanding the difference in the dog
on the one hand, and the cat and rabbit on the other, in the effect of
stimulating the sympathetic on the bucco-facial region, a small dose
of nicotin causes in each case a primary flushing in the region ; in the
doc the flushing is most intense, in the cat and rabbit it is compara
tively slight, and may be very brief. Of this we shall have more to
say in a later paper on the general action of nicotin.
   Having thus given the effects which may be expected to follow
stimulation of the sympathetic in the neck, we may now proceed to
consider the order in which they cease on injecting into the blood
vessels small doses of nicotin.            Our experiments have been made upon
the rabbit, cat, and dog.            As a rule, in any one experiment, a few
only of the effects can be accurately observed.                   Thus, in order to
observe with certainty a          slight   dilation  of the   pupil, it may be neces
sary to pull back the eyelids, in which case a slight movement of the
eyelids,  if   such were caused by the stimulation, might escape observa
tion.     It has appeared to us that the effect of stimulating the
sympathetic on the movements of the eyelids, the eye, and especially
on the nictitating membrane, diminishes with the amount of the anaes
thetic given.        At any rate, in the rabbit and cat we have occasionally
observed so little effect on the nictitating membrane to be caused by
stimulating the sympathetic, that no certain conclusion could be
drawn from the absence of such effect after giving nicotin.
    It is necessary, then, to note carefully to what extent the various
effects which may be produced by stimulating the sympathetic are in
fact produced, immediately before the introduction of nicotin.
    In nearly all cases the sympathetic in the neck was ligatured and
 cut. This was done, in the first place, to avoid reflex action, and,
 secondly, in the hope that, since section of the sympathetic commonly
 produces the opposite effects of stimulation, the effects of stimulation
 micht thereby become more marked.                   It has often been noticed that
 section of the sympathetic produces a transient slight effect only, or
 even none ; this was the case in most of our experiments, so that at
 the time of injecting nicotin, the ears and pupils on the two sides were
 alike, occasionally the ear being flushed but the pupil not contracted,
 or the pupil being a little contracted but the ear not flushed, on the
 cut side.
    We have mentioned above that we have sometimes made observa-

tions on the progressive paralysis of the different sympathetic actions
by giving a dose insufficient to paralyse them all, and some
times by giving a larger dose and noting the progressive recovery.
 The former method is more troublesome, but briDgs out greater
differences than the latter.             The order of recovery is inversely as the
order of primary paralysis.
    The Rabbit. — As anaesthetics we have used chloral, and afterwards
chloroform and ether, 01, more rarely, chloral and morphia. In the
anaesthetised animal the eyes are directed forward, and the pupils are
rather large ; after nicotin has been injected the eyes are directed
forward, ar.d the pupils are in nearly all cases smaller than previously.
 With regard to the relative time of paralysis of the secretory fibres
in the cervical sympathetic, we have made no observations in the
rabbit.
    The easiest comparison to make is that between one of the changes
which occur in the eye and the pallor of the ear. In the following
experiment the comparison is made between the dilation of the pupil
and the constriction of the central artery of the ear.                       The difference
between the ease and duration of the paralysis of these two actions,
though always appreciable, is nevertheless sometimes slight. The
experiment we quote shows, perhaps, the maximum difference which
we have observed.

   When we come to compare the effects more in detail, the difficulty
is greater.      This is especially the case in comparing the vaso-con-
strictor effects on the ear, month, and conjunctiva ; for the pallor of
all three, which often lasts for some time, and not for an equal time,
as a secondary result of the nicotin makes it difficult to be certain of
the beginning of vaao-constrictor action.
   The movement of the nictitating membrane is more easily paralysed
than the movement of the eyelids, and the latter is a little more
easily paralysed than the dilation of the pupil.                       For the rest, the
apparent    order    of   ease   of  paralysis     is vaso-constrictors    of conjunctiva,
vaso-constrictors of mouth, vaso-constrictors of ear ; we say apparent
order of paralysis, because we have instances from separate experi
ments, in which there has been, so far as could be judged, a simul
taneous recovery in the dilation of the pupil and the pallor of the
conjunctiva; pallor of conjunctiva and pallor of mouth; pallor of
mouth and pallor of ear. The following experiments will illustrate

    Ths Cat. — In the cat, the secretory nerve cells of the superior
cervical ganglion are paralysed before any others.                        After a small
dose of nicotin (3 to 5 mgm.), stimulation of the cervical sympathetic
causes, for a short time, no secretion of saliva, but still causes, or may
cause, all the other effects normally seen as the result of the stimula
tion. . The difference in the ease and duration of paralysis is in this
case very striking. On the other hand, there is often very little
difference in the ease of paralysis of the nerve cells of the superior
cervical ganglion, which are connected with other classes of nerve
fibres.     There are some differences which are constant, but which
vary very considerably in degree.                In the following experiment, the
difference between the time of paralysis of the vaso-motor effects on
the ear and the dilator effect on the pupil is the maximum we have
found.
                                       Experiment V.
   Cat (C. p. 24). Chloroform given, then morphia subcutaneously, and occasionally
chloroform and ether. Cannula in the duct of the left sub-maxillary gland. Sym
pathetic in neck tied and cut on left side.        Cut left chordo-lingual.   The pupil is
rather large ; stimulation of the sympathetic with a weakish current (c — 9) causes
the nictitating membrane to be drawn back, the eye to open, the pupil to dilate, the
artery of the ear to constrict, and a secretion of saliva.
   12.53. Inject into crural vein, 5 mgm. nicotin.         The injection causes, amongst
              other effects, those described above as resulting from stimulation of the
              sympathetic.

case.

             and lips at first, changing to slight flushing at end of stimulation; pupil,

    Iu this experiment, the dilation of the pupil was noticed before the
opening of the eye, but, in some other cases, we have not been able
to satisfy ourselves that this occurred. And it is possible that the
position of the eyelids, whether nearly closed, or half-open, as they
usually are after nicotin, influences the result. Similarly, we have
not been able to assure ourselves at what time, in relation to the dila
tion of the pupil, a paling of the conjunctiva, and a paling of the
mucous membrane of the mouth, occurs.                      We are inclined to place
 them in order of ease of paralysis, as follows : paling of mouth,
paling of conjunctiva, opening of eyelids, dilation of pupil. We have
not made a comparison between the ease of paralysis of the sym
pathetic effect upon the withdrawal of the nictitating membrane and
the constriction of the vessels of the ear.
    The Dog. — When nicotin, even in large amount, is injected into a
vein in the dog, there is a rapid recovery of the effect of stimulating
the cervical sympathetic* as regards the constriction of the small
arteries of the salivary glands, the dilation of the pupil, and the
secretion of saliva.          We have generally observed a slight difference
in the time of recovery of these three effects, in the order in which
 they are mentioned above, but there are special difficulties in the way
of determining the exact time when stimulation of the nerve begins

    The other effects of stimulating the cervical sympathetic are, how
ever, more easily suppressed                 by nicotin.        The one most readily
abolished is the flushing of the lips.                   With regard to the relative
ease of paralysis of the movements of the eye, eyelids, nictitating
membrane, and pallor of the mucous membrane of the mouth, we
have made a few experiments only, so that we cannot speak of them
with much confidence.                  The order, so far as our experiments go
 (cf. Exp. VI), is movement of the eyelids, movement                              of the
nictitating membrane, pallor of the lips.

   Left sympathetic separated from vagus for about an inch below superior cervical
ganglion, ligatured, and cut. With secondary coil at 10 (o = 10), the shocks are
distinctly felt on the tongue, but are not strong ; with secondary coil at 6 (c = 6),
the shocks are strong to the tongue. Stimulation of sympathetic with c = 10
causes flushing of lips and gums.

               may be the after-effect of nicotin ; no other change. The eye quickly
               shuts on touching the skin near it.

   1.52. Stim. sy., c = 8, 60 sees, t pupil dilates readily, no other change observed;
               on left side lips are very pale, and the nictitating membrane is partially
               drawn back ; on right side lips are pinkish, and nictitating membrane is

               pale.
    An interesting result is often obtained by stimulating the sym
pathetic after a rather larger dose of nicotin ; in this case, the pupil
is rather large, the eye is turned forwards, and the eye is open, but
not widely ; stimulation of the sympathetic then causes the eyelids
slowly to approach one another, i.e., the eye, instead of opening,
becomes more closed.              The movement is chiefly in the lower eyelid.
On ceasing the stimulation the eye gradually opens to its previous
extent.       The closing of the eye on stimulating the sympathetic occurs
at a time when the stimulation still produces dilation of the pupil and
secretion of saliva.           It will be remembered that Rogowiez* observed
occasionally a similar closing of the eye in the dog when the sym-

 pathetic was stimulated several days after section of the facial nerve.
 He attributed it to a contraction of the orbicularis palpebrarum.           It
is possible that the sympathetic has nerve fibres stimulation of which
causes closure of the eye, as well as fibres stimulation of which causes
opening of the eye, and that the nerve cells in the superior cervical
ganglion connected with the former are less easily paralysed by
nicotin ; but there is no decisive evidence of this, and the closure
obtained may be explained in other ways.
                                       Summary.
    Generally speaking, stimulation of the cervical sympathetic in the
dog with minimal effective shocks causes pallor in the lips and gums ;
with weak to moderately strong shocks, primary pallor followed by
flushing ; with strong shocks, as shown by Dastre and Morat,
primary flashing, but the extent and duration of the primary effect
and of the secondary effect, if there is. any, varies in different dogs.
    In the rabbit and cat, stimulation of the cervical sympathetic
always causes, as shown by Bochefontaine and Vulpian, primary
pallor in the lips and gums, and the after-flush is not great.            The
pallor    we   find  is bilateral ; the  degree of the pallor on the  opposite
side to that stimulated varies in individual cases, and can be seen on
the tongue, as well as on the lips and gums.
    On injecting nicotin into a vein, certain of the normally occurring
effects of stimulating the cervical sympathetic cease before the others,
i.e., since all the effects can still be produced by stimulating the fibres
running from the superior cervical ganglion, the nerve cells in the
ganglion, which are connected with different classes of nerve fibres,
are paralysed with different degrees of ease by nicotin.
    Arranging the various effects in the order of ease of paralysis, we
have: —

         (7.)  Constriction of blood-vessels of the sub-maxillary gland.
   (1) Differences between these have not always been observed.
   At a certain stage of nicotin poisoning, when stimulation of the
sympathetic does not cause withdrawal of the nictitating membrane,
but does cause dilation of the pupil, a partial closing of the eye is
obtained by stimulating the sympathetic.
   It will be noticed that in each animal nicotin abolishes most of the
effects of stimulating the cervical sympathetic at very nearly the
same time.      With regard to these, we think that there is only a
prima facie case for regarding the differences observed as due to an
unequal paralysis of the nerve cells of the superior cervical ganglion,
for it is possible that the differences may be due to an unequal tonic
stimulation reaching the parts by nerve fibres other than the sym
pathetic.     But the greater differences observed, for instance, between
the secretion of saliva and the dilation of the pupil in the cat, the
flushing of the lips and the constriction of the vessels of the sub
maxillary gland in the dog, we do not think cau be due to such a
cause, and we attribute them to an unequnl paralysing action of
nicotin upon the nerve cells of the superior cervical ganglion.

Crooniax Lecture. — " On some Relations between Host and
       Parasite in certainEpidemic Diseases of Plants." By H.
       Marshall Ward, F.R.S., Professor of Botany, Royal
       Indian Engineering College, Cooper's Hill.                 Received
       and read February 27, 1890.
         Introduction — Relations between  Physiology and Pathology.
    I thought   I could not better respond   to the honour of the invita
tion to give the Croonian Lecture this year than by choosing a
subject from the domain of plant pathology, which should, at least,
have the merit of being of general interest and importance, and
it seemed probable that an account of some of the more conspicuous
features and recent results of the study of certain fungoid dis
eases might be so placed before you that it should illustrate not
only the kind of progress which plant pathology is making, but
also show how dependent that progress is, and must be, on the
advances of physiology. Moreover, I hope to be able to demonstrate
*hat the connexion between these two modern branches of science
is (in botany, at any rate, and I have no reason to doubt that the
truth applies to the animal kingdom as well) so close and so mutual
that the problems which arise daily appeal to students of both depart
ments, and necessitate that each shall know what the other is about.
 This, of course, is not the same as saying that either branch of study
is deficient in its special questions ; but it cannot be too much
 insisted upon that, while the facts and generalisations of pathology
often throw light on physiological questions, the enquirer into the
 pathology of plants has to pause at almost every step and ask some
question in physiology, and his progress may be slower or more rapid
 in proportion as the answer is obscure or the reverse.
    For, after all, the pathology of plants embraces those phenomena
 of abnormal life-processes which can go on in the long series of
 changes between normal, healthy, vigorous life, and the cessation of
 that life as such, i.e., death ; and it is obviously impossible to study
 these abnormal life-processes (pathological) without reference to the
 normal ones (physiological).       In other words, then, pathology is the
 study of disturbed or abnormal physiological processes, and I thought
 that it would be possible to interest you in some of the phenomrna of
 abnormal plant life, and especially in the working of some of these
 factors which result in producing certain diseases, in which fungi
 play the prominent part, and which occasionally assume the nature
of epidemics so suddenly that the phenomena continually prove too
much tor the inherent credulity of those who are not in the habit of

394         Prof. H. Marshall Ward.            The Relations    beticeen

              The Diseases of Plants and their Classification,      §v.
   The diseases of plants have been classified in various ways, at
¦different times, and by different observers.           Passing over the earlier
attempts,* based for the most part on errors which were natural at
FlO.  1. A  young coffee plant  (reduced), the leaves of which are badly infected
     with tho TJredinous fungus Hemileia     vastatrix.   The paler spots are bright
     orange-yellow, the centre gradually turns brown, and then black as the tissues
     are destroyed l the granular appearance on the younger spots is duo to the
     spores of the fungus.   Such yellowing of the leaves is a common symptom of
     such diseases.

 the time, but some of which seem almost incomprehensible now, as
 some of our present errors will appear in the fu ture, it may be said
 that no very exhaustive survey of these diseases as a whole was
 possible until comparatively recent times.          The successive attempts
¦of  modern authors* have been almost entirely along one or other of
 two lines : they have classified the diseases either (1) according to
 the symptoms externally visible and the organs attacked, or
 (2) according to the causes which seem most concerned in producing
 the disease.
    Whichever method is adopted, it is repeatedly found that large
 assumptions have to be made and recognised in order to bring given
-diseases into the sphere of treatment for the time being, and diffi
 culties of very peculiar nature continually make themselves felt.
    As an instance, we may take the well-known symptom of the
appearance of yellow leaves. Not only are yellow leaves charac
 teristic of many diseases due to fungi of the groups Uredinese
 and Ascomycetes (Peziza, Hysterium, Polystigma, $"c.), or to the
 attacks of insects (e.g., Aphides), but they may indicate "something
 wrong " at the roots — want of drainage, over-drainage, or lack of some
 ingredient such as iron, or the presence of some noxious mineral,
 to say nothing of parasites            (Phylloxera, Melolontha, Agaricus
 melleus,                        '
            S-cJ).
    In   cold weather in the    spring yellow leaves may mean that the
 temperature is too low for the production of the green chlorophyll ;
 while frost is responsible for the yellowing of other leaves by a
 totally different procedure — -the acid substances in the cells are
 enabled to diffuse through to the chlorophyll corpuscles and kill them.
    Yellow leaves often indicate the access of too littlo sunlight, but
 they may be produced by too intense insolation and consequent
destructive changes in the cells.
    Leaves injured by acid gases and poisonous substances in smoke
also turn yellow, and the yellow hue of autumnal leaves is well
known, while we have numerous yellow varieties of leaves among
cultivated plants, the causes for which are less clear.
    These are by no means all the cases observable, but they will suffice
to show how little can be inferred from a symptom which may be due
to so many causes, operating alone or in combination, be it said. In
fact, as a symptom, the yellowing of leaves is of scarcely any classi-
ficatory value, and we are driven to the conclusion that the leaves
of  plants react to most injuries by turning yellow.
    It is much the same with other classes of disease named after the
prominent symptoms.            What is usually termed " canker," for

       J
we now ask how the matter stands with regard to the method of clas
sifying diseases of plants according to their chief causes, the answers
are no clearer.     It is the custom to proceed somewhat as follows : —
   There are, Jirst, diseases due to the action of the non-living en-
environment (soil, climate, mechanical injuries, &c.~) ; and, secondly,
diseases due to the attacks of living beings (parasitic insects,
fungi, &c.).
   Now, leaving out of account altogether certain totally unexplained
diseases, such as some forms of " gumming," &c., it becomes apparent
that we are liable to all kinds of errors unless we recognise that no
one factor ever accounts for a disease ; it is not so obvious, however,
that the changes which result in disease are usually due to several
factors acting in concert or successively, and         I  shall try to show that,
even in marked cases, it is by no means always easy to decide which

of the co-operating factors are to be brought into the foreground,
though, until this is decided, it may be a hopeless task to consider
prophylactic measures.           As examples of the complex interactions
that may be       met    with   in  the first group of diseases as arranged
above, we might consider the following : —
   A soil is said to be unsuitable as regards aspect, or elevation, or
steepness, but it will be evident that the degree of unsuitableness
may vary with the depth and structure of the soil, and with the lati
tude, the proximity of mountain ranges or the sea, and other factors
which influence the climate ; instances of disease, in the broad sense
of the word, are frequent enough where two neighbouring crops or
growths of the same species of plant suffer in very different degrees,
owing to slightly different combinations of such factors of the
environment ; and the difficulty of referring the disease more espe
cially to any one cause only increases with experience.                   Or, take
the strncture, &c., of the soil. It may vary in chemical composition,
in capacity for retaining water, in physical texture, and so forth ;
and the enormous differences to be met with are best known to those
who have to cultivate large estates or continuously observe large
tracts of country.         But it is matter of general experience that the
chemical composition of a soil is one of its least important features

398         Prof. H. Marshall Ward.            The Relations      between
tvithin wide limits ; much more important is the amount of water
 and air in it, and the way they are held there.                  These, especially
 under certain crops, affect the climate of the immediate locality, and
 all kinds of complexities result. To mention one only, there are
 certain combinations of soil and climate, &c., which result in the
trees being "frost-bitten" whenever there are late spring frosts.                 In
 some cases it is found that mere drainage puts an end to the evil ;
this means not only a removal of water, but an increase of air in the
 soil and general elevation of temperature.              In others it is noticed
that the more shaded trees suffer most ; this is in part because their
tissues are more watery, and their cell-walls more delicate.               In others
the injury occurs on a particular side of the tree, and is ruled
chiefly by the prevailing winds.           Now, here is a problem of con
siderable complexity. Frost (i.e., too low a temperature) is the agent
directly concerned, but it accomplishes the injury because the shoots
are too succulent, and the tissues too feebly developed, to resist a
temperature which they would be perfectly able to resist if more
carbohydrates had been formed under a brighter light, and if less
water containing more oxygen had ascended their stems, and so
forth.
    It is at least difficult to class such cases, and they arise every day.
Who would have suspected that one result of bringing the larch down
from its mountain home would be to render it more liable to injury
from certain pests kept in abeyance on its native Alps, because it is
stimulated to put forth its young leaves when the insects are about,
which puncture the cortex and afford means of entrance for certain
parasitic fungi ?
    On turning attention to the diseases referred to the action of living
organisms, we meet with difficulties rather greater than less, and it is
chiefly on account of these that so many wild hypotheses are current
as to this class of diseases.
    Omitting more than a mere reference to the diseased or weakened
conditions due to competition with weeds, and with overbearing
associates, such as Thelephora laciniata, which may overshadow
young Conifers, and eventually kill them simply by depriving them of
light,* and to the various parasitic Phanerogams such as Loranthtcs,
the mistleto, dodder, &c.,f we come to an enormous series of diseases
due to parasitic insects (and other animals) and fungi.
   The chief difficulty connected with the investigation of diseases
induced by fungi is due to the double set of complications involved.               It
is difficult enough to uuravel the tangled skeins of causes and effects

  in the case of the comparatively simple diseases referred to above ; but
  when the problem consists in disclosing the life-history of a micro
  scopic fungus on the one hand, and then in discovering its relations
  to the plant (the biology of which is always assumed to be known) on
  or in which it passes the whole or part of this life-history, on the
 other, the matter rapidly attains unexpected proportions. Yet this is
 never the whole, or necessarily the major part, of the real problem —
 the nature of the disease — and before that can be even approximately
 solved we have to obtain an insight into the influence of the non
 living environment on both the host-plant and the parasitic fungus,
 an inquiry which may assume appalling proportions before it is far
 advanced.
     Nor is this the end, though it is quite sufficient to account for the
 fact that we never know all about any of these diseases.
     There is a factor — or set of factors — which always tends to baffle
 the inquirer into these matters, and that is the internal disposition* of
 the parts of the organisms concerned ; call it what we will — constitu
 tion, inherited disposition, &c. — the fact remains that the host-plant
 and the parasite alike exhibit peculiarities of behaviour that cannot
 be explained in the present condition of science as directly due to
 the action of any external agency of the environment, although we
 are no doubt right in concluding that it is the outcome of the cumu
 lative results of the vicissitudes of the species and its ancestors in the
 long past.
     But it is just the reactions of this constitution, and its variations
.induced by changes in the physical environment, which are so often
 and so persistently overlooked, although the attempt to understand
 any disease is hopeless, unless we take them into consideration.              I
 hope to show, in the course of this lecture, how the modern study
 of the pathology of plants differs in methods from that of our prede
 cessors, especially in this very particular — the recognition of the
 reactions of the host to its living and non-living environment, as
 apposed to the reactions of the parasite to its living and non-living
 environment, and, further, of the truth that disease is the outcome of
 a want of balance in the struggle for existence just as truly as normal
 life is the result of a different poising of the factors of existence.
     Of course, inasmuch as the abnormal state of affairs, while detri
 mental to the host, is the best possible for the parasite, we have here
 the elements of a paradox ; but there is no real confusion of ideas
 here ; we are concerned with a particular case, illustrative of the
 struggle for existence, in which a given set of variable factors of the
 environment favour one organism at a time when they disfavour
 another.

scription of the histological peculiarities of the cell, and it will
probably suffice to remind you that great differences occur in detail
as to the size of the cell, the thickness of the wall, number and sizes
of the chlorophyll corpuscles, and the presence or absence of colouring
matters, crystals, various organised bodies, and so forth. Finally, it
will be remembered that all the parts — cell wall, nucleus, chlorophyll
corpuscles, and protoplasm generally* — are more or less thoroughly
saturated with water, and that aqueous vapour and gases will be found
in varying proportions in the passages between the cells, and con
tinuous with the atmosphere, on the one hand, and writh the water in
the roots and soil, on the other.
   Let us now inquire what these normal living cells are doing when
they still form an integral part of the tissues of the healthy plant.
   In the first place, they are respiring. That is to say, the protoplasm
absorbs oxygen gasf brought to it in the water from the roots, from the
intercellular spaces which communicate with the atmosphere by means
of stomata and lenticels, and from the chlorophyll corpuscles when
they are assimilating in bright light.     This oxygen enters in solution
into the protoplasm, and combines with some of the bodies which for
the time being enter into the composition of this complicated
structure.    The effects of these unions of the oxygen are expressed in
molecular disturbances in the protoplasm : some bodies are broken
down, others enter into new unions.       Finally, the disturbing actions
of the energetic oxygen result in the combustion of certain carbon-
compounds to carbon dioxide and water, and these escape from the
field of action : such combustion implies the liberation of energy,
and we recognise this in the complicated movements and life-processes
set up in the protoplasm and in the rise of temperature, which can be
proved to take place.J One point of importance should be insisted
on from the first.     When the oxygen- molecule enters the protoplasm,
it must be pictured as coming into a busy arena, where numerous
but definite possibilities are presented to     and although we are not
                                                                     it,

 they do in      ordinary   combustion    —nevertheless, we must not fall            into
the error of supposing that so much sugar or starch in the protoplasm
 is forthwith and simply oxidised to carbon dioxide and water, nor
 may we conclude that the process is one             of simple and direct oxidation
 at all.*
    In the first instance, it is chiefly owing to the vagaries of the
oxygen-molecules in the living protoplasm, that the latter exercises
the processes of metabolism, the second group of functions we have to
consider.
    The metabolic processes which can be referred to the changes
 brought about during respirationf result in two series of events. On
the one hand, compounds of various kinds pass out of the protoplasm
— the arena of metabolic activity — into other parts of the cell, and
especially into the cell-sap ; and, on the other hand, bodies of com
paratively simple constitution are brought from the cell-sap and
elsewhere into the arena of activity, and there worked up into more
complex bodies.          It is impossible to separate these two sets of pro
cesses ; but, if we abstract them mentally, for purposes of simplicity,
we may say that the following series of events important for our
present purposes are taking place.
    Carbohydrates, especially in the form of glucoses, are being taken
up into the protoplasm, and built up into the structure of its sub
stance : here, owing to the attacks of the oxygen of respiration,
the structures into which they enter are more or less broken down —
as before said, not necessarily merely oxidised as such or directly —
and the complex into which they have temporarily entered becomes
decomposed, again to be built up anew by the aid of more carbo
hydrates,     and so on repeatedly.
    Among the temporary products of these destructive processes, in the
complex alternations of building up and breaking down here going
on, we find certain nitrogenous compounds (amides and allied bodies)
like asparagin, leucin, glutamin, &c., playing important parts.                      The
evidence goes to show that so long as plenty of carbohydrates are at
the disposal of the protoplasm, these amide-bodies are again worked

down, and repeat the process,* and so on.
    If, however, for any reason a lack of these carbohydrates occurs,
then these amide-bodies increase for the time being, and the proto
plasm suffers accordingly ; in fact, it undergoes further decompositions
as a result of starvation.
    The evidence also goes to show that organic acids (such as malic,
citric, tartaric, oxalic, &c.) are formed in the protoplasm, and accu
mulate in the cell-sap during these metabolic processes, as products
of incomplete oxidation, and their variations in quantity depend
greatly on the activity of these metabolic processes, and, therefore, on
the intensity of respiration.f           A fact of primary importance for us is
that these organic acids increase considerably in amount under con
ditions which lead to less complete oxidation, and, conversely, they
decrease when certain oxidation-processes in the cell are promoted.
In other words, they are continually being formed and destroyed in
metabolic changes, and sometimes one process, sometimes another,
predominates.
    As a third group of life-processes which our selected cells would
exhibit, we may regard the phenomena of growth ; processes which
are intimately dependent upon respiration and metabolism, and, indeed,
inseparable from them in life.
    For our present purpose, it suffices to regard growth as consistingJ
in an extension of the still soft cellulose cell-walls, which tends to
increase the area of the membrane at the expense of their thickness,
and in a compensating increment in their thickness due to the
activity of the protoplasmic lining in secreting and laying on cellulose
on the inside of, or even in the structure of, the wall.                 Passing over
the fact that the secretion of this cellulose is another manifestation of
metabolic activity on the part of the protoplasm, it is important to
notice that growth is only possible so long as respiration is proceeding,
and so long as the cell is turgid. § Now turgidity depends on tho

 presence in the cell of water under pressure : that is to say, in a
 turgid cell there is in the sap cavity sufficient water not only to
 supply all the demands of the cell-walls aud protoplasm, but to keep
 them distended as well, and this to such a degree that the cellulose
 walls, with their lining of protoplasm, are positively stretched in
 opposition to the elastic resistance offered by the former. Recent re
 searches have proved that this excess of water is largely due to the
 osmotic attraction exerted by the organic acids and their salts dis
 solved in the sap of the cell,* and since we have seen that the forma
 tion and destruction of these acids depend on the processes connected
 with oxidation and respiration, we obtain a f uther glimpse into the
 complicated correlations here concerned.                    For our purpose the im
 portant points are that, during active turgescence, the growing cells
 tend to become very watery and their cell-walls to be thinned by
 stretching, and this in spite of the activity of the protoplasm in
adding new materials ; while bodies such as soluble amides and
organic acids are being formed continuously and in relative and vary
 ing abundance, to undergo further changes in the never ending
 turmoil of metabolism, as already indicated.
    But it is evident that these processes of respiration, destructive
 metabolism, and growth must sooner or later come to an end if the
stores of carbohydrates fail, since these are the substances which
 ultimately supply the fuel for respiration, and which form the raw-
 materials by means of which new protoplasm may be constructed ;
and it is well known that the plant respires and grows to death                           if
 placed in such circumstances that no new supplies of these substances
are possible.       We must remember that we are concerned with normal
 green cells, however, and we have now to consider the new set of
events due to the assimilative action of the chlorophyll corpuscles to
 which these cells owe their colour.              It is not necessary to remind you
 that this process of carbon assimilation^ consists in the coming
 together of carbon dioxide and water in the green corpuscles, where,
 by means of energy obtained in certain rays of sunlight, the molecules
of the carbon dioxide and water are torn asunder and eventually in
 part rearranged ; speaking generally, we may say that some of the
constituents (oxygenj) escape, while others (carbon, hydrogen, and

carbohydrates, which then separate from the protoplasm.*
     We are here, of coarse less concerned with the difficulties which
beset the questions, what rays of light are concerned in this process,
how their energy is employed in the chlorophyll, and what part the
chlorophyll itself takes directly in the process ; or with questions as
 to the exact products formed during the putting together of the
 carbohydrate in the protoplasm of the chlorophyll corpuscle, and so
on, than with certain well-established facts and conclusions, such as
the following.
     The process of building up the products obtained by the decompo
sition of the carbon dioxide and water in the protoplasm into carbo
hydrates goes on continuously in the sunlight, so long as it is
 sufficiently intense, and the excess beyond what is immediately re
quired for the nourishment and respiration (i.e., the maintenance of
metabolic activity) of the living substances of the cell takes the final
 form (usuallyt) of starch. Free oxygen escapes all the time, and, in
 so far as this is not absorbed for purposes of oxidation, there and then
 in the cell, this oxygen goes to eurich the atmosphere.                               Moreover,
 these    temporary          stores    of  starch    are  continuously     being    transformed
into soluble glucoses, by means of diastatic fermentsj in the proto
 plasm ; this process goes en day and night, and its result may be
easily demonstrated in the case of leaves removed from the plant after
exposure to the sunlight during the day. After a few hours in a
warm, dark, normal atmosphere, relatively large quantities of glucose
are found in the cells, while the starch is disappearing. This glucose,
 I need hardly remind you, is the soluble movable form of the carbo
hydrates^ and it is worked up again, so far as it is in excess of the

 (' Phil. Trans.,' 1772) to the present time. It may bo said to fall under four heads :
 (1) the nature and functions of ohlorophyll ; (2) the absorption of carbon dioxide
and the evolution of oxygen ; (3) the intensity and kind of light necessary ; (4) the
chemical processes which intervene between the coming together of the carbon

immediate requirements of the living protoplasm, into the form of
reserve starch, &c., by the protoplasm.*
     At certain periods, therefore, the cells may contain relatively large
quantities of this soluble, nutritious, and easily oxidised glucose.
     We have still to refer shortly to another set of events taking place
in the normal living cells, the connexion of which with the above
simultaneous f unctions will be obvious.               This is the passage of water
from one cell to another, a process depending essentially upon the
modified evaporation — transpiration^ — going on at those surfaces of
the cell walls which are in contact with the air in the intercellular
spaces, &c., and the rapidity and magnitude of whose movements
 depend on a variety of circumstance.
     This water comes from the vascular system, by which it is brought
 up from the soil after being absorbed by the root-hairs, and it contains
 traces of the necessary mineral salts —chiefly sulphates, nitrates, and
 phosphates of calcium, magnesium                and potassium, in small, and
                         —
 varying quantities as well as dissolved gases. Whether the oxygen
 dissolved in the water absorbed at the root reaches the cells higher up
 in the plant or no, it is at least clear that the water in these cells
 becomes oxygenated by contact with the atmospheric air which pene
 trates into the intercellular, spaces, via the stomata and lenticels.J
 Moreover, it is impossible to doubt that oxygen reaches the water in
 the cells from the assimilating chlorophyll corpuscles.                  However, we
 are not     confined    to  inferences    in  this   connexion,    since   Pfeffer has
 conclusively shown that free oxygen does exist in the cell-sap§ in the
 normal condition.
     The importance of this matter for my purpose is that the move-

 &c. ; and Saposehnikoff (' Ber. d. Deutsch. Bot. Gesell.,' 1889, p. 258). The organic
acids cannot be employed with the same results (see Wehmer, op. cit., p. 71 3), though
they can be absorbed and oxidised in the living cells (Warburg, op. cit., pp. 112 —
113) more rapidly than they are decomposed outside the plant.

408         Prof. H. Marshall Ward.                The Relations between
how the killing is brought about, so far as the final appearances are
concerned.     We may place the cell, for instance, for a few minntes in
hot water (say 55 — 80° C.), or expose it to very low temperatures, or
to the vapour of chloroform, to acid gases, &c., and in each case the
morphological changes are substantially the same.*              In the first
place, the movements of the protoplasm cease, and the granulation
increases, while the whole contracts away from the cell walls into a
more or less shrivelled, irregular lump.       The cell-sap, previously held
in the sap-vacuolesf under pressure in the turgescent living cell, now
escapes, and suffuses the whole tissue, evidently because, the structure
of the protoplasm being destroyed, it can no longer be kept in bounds
as it was before.     It would carry us too far to enter into the discus
sion as to   what  kind  of changes the protoplasmic lining has undergone
in its different layers ; it suffices to note the fact that, whereas the
living protoplasm was able to regulate the entrance of substances into
the cell-sap and their escape from                no longer able to do so
                                                   it,   it   is
when the cell has been killed, and the uncontrolled sap escapes as said.
This sap      acid, often strongly so, and contains, among other things,
             is
certain bodies, known generally as chromogenes, which, on exposure
to the air, undergo oxidation changes which result in the formation of
brown colouring matters.        We know very little about these chromo
genes beyond      the  fact  of their existence, but the evidence goes to
show that they are unstable bodies of various kinds which are present
in the cell-sap under such conditions that they are not directly oxi
dised by the passive oxygen dissolved in the sap          on exposure to the
                                                                    ;
air, however, some substance in the sap acts as an oxygen-carrier, and
they undergo the change of colour referred to.           The consequence of
                                                                   J
this  is that the disorganised protoplasm, cell walls, &c., of the tissnes
thus suffused turn brown, resulting in the well-known colours of dead
vegetable tissues.      These changes are accelerated by the organic acids,
which cause the chlorophyll grains to turn yellow, and then suffer
further changes from the oxygen of the air.
   It is, of course, unnecessary to remark that all the rhythmical series
of processes connected with the living cell are now put an end to                 :
respiration, metabolism, growth, assimilation have obviously ceased,
as have all the other functions of the cell.     Moreover, the evaporation
of water     isno longer controlled by the conditions imposed on          by it

which bring about the final result.

the protoplasm of membranes of living cells,* anl if the weather
becomes dry the dead tissues rapidly desiccate and shrivel.
     In attaining the above described extreme, commonly called death,
the normal living cell, in the condition commonly called health,
passes through a series of vicissitudes which affect every part of
it ; but it is necessary to admit that the state called death and that
called life, in the above discussion, are by no means definite and
utterly distinct from one another — on the contrary, the very essence
of life consists in its mobility, and the living cell is continually
approaching and receding from the state termed death.                    In a certain
sense, no doubt, death may be regarded as the cessation of life, but
this does not help us, because the crux resides in determining when
life ceases in the protoplasm. Of course we can lay our hands, as it
were, on given cells or tissues of cells, and say these are "living,"
whereas others are "dead," but the difficulty is to decide when the
one state passes into the other.
     Between normal life, i.e., the condition of affairs where the life-
processes are going on actively, and the state of permanent death,
then, there are all possible gradations : many of these gradations
coincide with the phenomena of disease — pathological conditions — and
it is towards this difficult domain that I have now to carry the
discussion.

     In describing the phenomena going on in what was termed the
                         I
normal, living cell, only hinted at the fact that variations, more or less
periodic in nature, occur in the intensity of the proce-ses, a truth which
at once shows the difficulty of deciding what a normally living cell
really is. But it is of the utmost importance to recognise that all the
 life-processes, and the changes dependent on them, are in their very
 nature variable.        One set of factors which bring about the variations
 are internal and inherited, and very little is known of them beyond
 the fact of their existence, which is usually formally expressed by the
                                                                       "

  minute that they may be neglected.
      The second set of factors is of much greater importance, because
 they give rise to pronounced and easily recognisable changes in the

plant. These factors are such as the following : changes of tempera
ture, variations in the intensity of the light, differences in the amount
of aqueous vapour in the atmosphere, <fcc., in short, the variable
factors of the physical environment of the plant. That these affect
the physiological processes in the cells is well known ;* but what I
have to do is to trace some of the effects, and show how they bring
the living tissues into such conditions that they more or less readily
resist or succumb to the attacks of certain parasitic fungi.
    Taking the more or less arbitrarily chosen but convenient headings
already employed — respiration, metabolism, growth, carbon assimila
tion, &c. — let us now see what kinds of effects the external agents
referred to may produce.
    Respiration, though it proceeds at very low temperatures,t is ren
dered considerably more energetic as the temperature rises, until,
after a certain relatively high temperature (about 45° C.) is reached,
it becomes less intense, and injury to the cells soon results, un
doubtedly from damage to the structure of the living substance,
owing to the excessive disturbances brought about in its metabolism.
Speaking generally, we may fairly say that at temperatures near 0° to
5° C. the respiration is very slow ; as the temperature rises the respira
tory activity increases, at first slowly, and gradually more and more
rapidly, till at 35° to 45° C. it is at its maximum intensity ; beyond
that it rapidly declines, and ceases with the death of the protoplasm
at about 50° C.
   Light appears to exert little or no effect on the normal process of
respiration, unless relatively very intense,} when it may possibly
promote it; but bright light may accelerate certain processes of
oxidation which would otherwise have gone on more slowly. § This
much probably may be said, however : in so far as light influences
oxidation processes (other than respiration) in the living cell, the
action increases with the intensity of the light.|| As we shall see

later on, there are some other remarkable changes going on in the
cell, and connected indirectly with the action of light and respiration,
bnt these do not probably affect the general conclusions just advanced,
close as is the connexion between respiration and metabolism gene
rally.
     The question now arises as to the quantity of oxygen necessary for
iespiration, and as to the effects of undue accumulation of the carbon
dioxide : it is too long a subject and it is unnecessary to discuss it in
detail.*       I need only remind you that in the absence of oxygen
respiration ceases, f while it is interfered with when the amount of
oxygen is much greater per unit of volume than in ordinary air, i.e.,
when the oxygen is condensed ; under ordinary circumstances, how
ever, the free oxygen of the atmosphere amply suffices, provided it
can pass readily into the cells and be renewed.                        Anything of the
nature of stagnation must be assumed to impede respiration, whether
 simply from the accumulation of carbon dioxide, or other products of
 respiratory activity and consequent metabolism, or because sufficient
 oxygen-molecules do not pass into the protoplasm in a given time.
 Since the extremes are not nearly attained in nature, however,                        I pass
 by this subject with the remark that in proportion as the intercellular
 passages or other communications with the atmosphere^ become
 blocked by condensed water, for instance, the ventilation of the
 plant — and therefore its respiration — may suffer§ for the time being
 simply on account of the slower diffusion of the gases, carbon dioxide
 and oxygen, from one part of the plant to another.
     Coming now to the subject of destructive metabolism, we find that
 it is affected by external factors ; in the first place, by whatever affects
 respiration, and therefore the foregoing remarks apply to metabolism
 generally.        This is especially so in the case of temperature, and the
 statements already given may serve broadly with respect to metabol
ism as a whole. A few details are of importance, however.                          We have

     § It is no uncommon event, even in England, to see the intercellular         passages of
 leaves blocked with suffused water after a cold night, but the phenomenon is much
 commoner in the tropics, and occurs quite generally in the hill country in Ceylon,
 for example. As the temperature rises during the morning, the wafer quickly
 evaporates and the leaf loses its dark, suffused, limp appearance, and becomes
 normal.     Of course, the phenomenon is due to proportionally more water being
 absorbed from the relatively warm soil than the cool air can take up. See also-

daring      the   metabolic processes of the cell — the organic acids and the
nmide-substances.              It appears from the evidence to hand that organic
acids      are not only formed, but are also subsequently oxidised, in the
cell, and it is only to be expected that this process of decomposition
of the acids is also promoted by raising the temperature, and con
versely,* and such is the case ; these acids increase during the night
and diminish during the day, and one important factor in (he pro-
cesses is temperature.                   The optimum of increment of organic acids
in the plant occurs            at  somewhat low temperaturesf — e.g., about 10° C.
to 15° C. ; while the minimum coincides approximately with that of
respiration (near 0G C.), and the acids cease to increase — or, rather,
they are decomposed as fast as, or faster than, they are produced — as
the temperature rises to 35 — 40°.
     With respect to the effects of light on metabolism, reference may
be made as to what has already been said as regards its promoting

certain processes of oxidation in the cells, and to what follows on
assimilation. The part played by oxygen also has been adverted to ;
metabolism in the ordinary course of events depends on respiration,
and all that affects the latter affects it. In the absence of free oxygen,
conditions of intense destructive metabolism are eventually set up,
the details of which we need not discuss. §                        If plenty of non-nitro
genous       food   materials        are   present,   the   metaholism     goes on for some
hours as usual, but soon the starving protoplasm undergoes more and
more profound changes, resulting eventually in a loss of proteid
substances.
     It  is important to bear in mind that in the cells containing chloro
phyll the free acids diminish in daylight, and increase as the light
fades and in darkness, no doubt because there is less oxygen in the
absence of that set free by the chlorophyll corpuscles ; these acids also
decrease in proportion as the temperature rises, and increase as it
falls. It is also important to be clear in this connexion as to the fact
that two processes are going on simultaneously — on the one hand,
organic acids are being formed as products of incomplete oxidation in
the respiratory processes, and, on the other, they are being further
oxidised and decomposed when the temperature is high and the light
 bright.|| Whether at any given moment the amount of acid present

 Anything which interferes with oxidation promotes the accumulation
 of organic acids, whereas those changes which lead to increased
oxidation in the cells are followed by a decrease of acids.
    Now a few words as to growth, and its dependence on external
 factors. Apart from the thickening of the cell-walls, which comes
afterwards and depends on the addition of materials formed by the
 protoplasm,* the principal phenomenon that concerns us is the exten
sion of the cellulose membranes.                 This process is promoted by
 moderately high temperatures, and retarded by low ones and by very
high ones,f in accordance with respiration and the general metabolism
of the cell ; the curves are not quite the same, because respiration
begins at temperatures too low for growth, and goes on rising in
 intensity to temperatures at which growth begins to decline ; still the
connexion is very close, and the dependence of growth on respiration
and metabolism implies this.
    Light is usually considered to have a retarding effect on the growth
 of the cells. Apart from the possibility that there may be a more
 direct action of light on the extensibility of cell-walls or of cells
 generally, by its effects on the protoplasm at the spot, one way in
 which this retarding effect may be brought about is in connexion
 with the turgidity of the cells. Without concerning ourselves with
 the general discussion of the whole subject, which would be a very
 long one, it seems, at least, clear that in the ordinary course of
events light exercises some retarding action on growth by exten
sion ; what, if any, connexion exists between this phenomenon and
the observed diminution of the organic acids in the cells (and we
have seen that their turgidity depends on these acids and their salts)
in daylight still needs investigation, and the same may be said as re
gards the influence of temperature in relation to growth and the
production of acids.         It is customary to regard the retarding action
of light on the extensibility of the cell- wall as a complex phenomenon
                    J
of irritability, and it is by no means certain that such is not the
case; meanwhile we simply accept the facts that in ordinary bright
light the extension of the growing parts is retarded, that this is
connected with diminished turgidity, which in its turn is depen
dent on the pressure in the sap of substances capable of retaining the
carbon assimilation, and not on any direct action of the rays of light, can hardly be
doubted (see Warburg, op. cit., pp. 77 — 92).

                      we accept, with de Vries,* that these substances
are chiefly the organic acids and their salts, then we may expect the
study of influence of light in promoting the decomposition of organic
acids in the plant to give more information on these matters. The
same remarks apply with regard to the influence of variations in tem
perature.

the quantity of water at the disposal of these cells varies enormonsly,

with the rapidity of the transpiration influenced by the atmosphere.

   Passing now to carbon assimilation,     come to the subject which
                                                        I
offers most interest for our enquiry.     Assimilation       also to some      is

from respiration       and the influence of even large variations
                       ;   f
in temperature may be masked by the effects of small variations
in other factors, especially light. Assimilation takes place at low
temperatures whenever respiration        possible, but the temperature
                                                       is

and above) where respiration         not yet most active, assimilation
                                            is
is already beginning to decline.    In the blackberry, for instance,
whereas assimilation     most active at between 29° and 33° C., re
                                 is
spiration goes on becoming more and more energetic to 46° C., at and
beyond which its effects are of course dangerous to the plant.      On                      J
the whole, we may conclude that at low temperatures, say, 5° to 10"                                C ,
on a bright spring morning, assimilation       relatively more active
                                                             is

distinctly the case.
   The effects of variations in the intensity and kind of light on assi

for our purposes as follows.
   With ordinary solar light, as     reaches the plant on a clear day in

 plant.    I  need not remind you that some rays of the solar light,
 especially some of the less refrangible (orange and red) rays, are more
 concerned in the process of assimilation than others, and, although we

 ;annot here stop to discuss this matter in detail, may point out that,
 as different rays of light are absorbed or reflected in the atmosphere,.
 we may have variations in this connexion of more or less importance
to the plant.       The experience of photographers shows that the different
thicknesses of the atmosphere through which the light has to pass,
 reflection from a cloud as contrasted with the " blue sky," &c., all
exert influence on the composition of the light, and in prolonged
cloudy, dull weather or fogs this factor may add its effects to those
due to the mere dilution of the light as a whole.
     But the fundamental nature of the necessity for a suitable intensity
of light of the right composition is best brought out in studying the
effects of low intensities of light on the green organs of plants.
    As is well known, the general effect of keeping a plant in the dark
is to induce a condition known as etiolation.*                     The whole plant
becomes pale yellow or colourless, and has a curiously                            trans
lucent, watery appearance ; the internodes are excessively long, while
the leaves, on the contrary, are usually small and crumpled.                     Closer
investigation shows that each cell of the internodes is abnormally
elongated, its cell- wall thinner than usual, and its chlorophyll corpus
cles small and wanting the green chlorophyll.                    If we examine the
vascular    bundles,    they  are  found   to be deficient  in firmness,   because the
substances which normally go to thicken their walls have not been
forthcoming.
    Everything about the etiolated shoot indicates tenderness, and as
a matter of fact such           shoots are very ill-adapted to withstand the
ordinary exigencies of plant life. Undoubtedly the chief cause for this
 weak condition is the absence of the light necessary for the purposes
of assimilation ; the carbon dioxide may be present, and even the fully
green chlorophyll could be developed by a few hours' exposure to feeble
 light, but these do not suffice for the construction of the materials
 such as glucose, starch, &c., necessary to enable the protoplasm to
keep the tissues normal.
    Nevertheless, the other functions of the cell are being carried on
 with remorseless pertinacity. The oxygen of the air enters the pro
 toplasm, establishes its usual combinations, and carbon dioxide and
water are given off to the air. The chemical changes known collec
tively as metabolism proceed, and result in the addition of substances
to the cell-sap which were not previously there. To an extent more
 marked than ever before, the turgid cells may be elongating, and this

brings us to note that the key to the condition of affairs is the fact
that the dry weight of the etiolated shoot is decreasing: every molecule
of carbon dioxide which comes away lessens the dry organic substance
of the plant, and no restoration of such substance is possible in the
absence of light.
   In other words, then, the etiolated plant is growing to death, at the
expense of what organic carbon-compounds it possessed at the begin
ning.
   Assimilation is, of course, profoundly affected, like every metabolic
process, according to the relative amounts of oxygen and carbon
dioxide in the air, and although it never happens in nature that the
extremes are approached, nevertheless experiments on this subject
have led to interesting results.*
   The quantity of water present in the plant and its atmosphere and
the rapidity of the transpiration current undoubtedly affect the
process of assimilation in a high degree.       Not only is water needed
for the molecular processes concerned in the act of assimilation, and
not only does the supply of materials to the protoplasm depend
mainly on the transpiration current, but, as we have seen, the
aeration of the intercellular passages, and consequently the move
ments of gases generally are affected.
   It has long been known that the quantities of carbon dioxide
absorbed, and of oxygen evolved, in the process of assimilation, vary
with the age of the leaf or other organ concerned, and Krenssler has
shown that one reason for these variations is the quantity of water
present in the tissues at the time.        In fact, an essential cause of
variations in assimilation exists in the differences in the water
contents of the t issues, f and it is no doubt largely due to the want of
water that older leaves assimilate so unequally — they are unable to
rapidly restore the equilibrium between losses and gains when it is
seriously disturbed.

 418          Prof. H. Marshall Ward.               The Relations between
  vapour     in it, it must be borne in mind that many events concur in
 promoting or retarding it. The stomata, for instance, open widely in
 bright sunshine and close in the dark,* a matter of great importance
  in controlling transpiration, as must be concluded from the researches
 of Garreau and von Hbhnel.t Other effects are traceable to the
  influence of the wind shaking the plant, and to the quantities of
  mineral salts, &c., in the soil, but it would carry me too far to discuss
  further instances.
     The principal [effects of obstructed transpiration may be shortly
 compared with those due to want of light — the watery tissues are
 strikingly like those of an etiolated plant, and we may look upon a
 shoot growing in a saturated atmosphere as presenting all the chief
  features of one growing in darkness.            J   Its cells are extremely turgid,
  with watery, soft, thin walls, and acid cell-sap ; its vascular bundles
  feebly developed and hardly lignified ; and, as before, it is ill adapted
  to withstand the exigencies of the ordinary environment.
     All such plants or organs are, so to speak, in a permanently young
 condition.

     If  we put together the results of the preceding discussion, it is
  evident that a plant may vary within very wide limits of the con
 dition we term health.            No doubt this needs no proof to the minds of
  most of my hearers, but the point I wish to emphasise is that, in some
 of its deviations from the normal,              the plant offers conditions to an
 attacking      parasite which may be at one time favourable, at another
  not.
     Suppose the case of a herbaceous plant growing under the follow
  ing circumstances in July : the temperature has been high, and the
 daily supply of solar light abundant during the previous four or five
  weeks, and everything has been going on admirably, so far. Suddenly
 the weather changes— the temperature falls, rain sets in, and for many
 •days heavy clouds obscure the sun.               If this markedly different, dull,
 cold weather         continues,     we may have the following condition of
  affairs more or less realised, as is well known to those who observe
  cultivated plants closely.
     Transpiration being lowered in activity, the whole plant tends more
i and more to be suffused with water ; the stomata are nearly closed,

the cell-walls bounding the inter-cellular passages and the air in the
passages themselves  are thoroughly saturated with water and aqueous
vapour respectively, and the movements of gases must be retarded
accordingly, turgescence is promoted, and the water contents accumu
late to a maximum, owing to the disturbance of equilibrium between
the amounts absorbed by the active roots in the relatively warm soil
and those passing off into the cold damp air; much more water is
absorbed by the roots in the relatively warm soil than passes off as
vapour in equal periods of time.           An enhanced wateriness of the
whole plant, then, is one result.
   But the low temperature, feeble light, and partially blocked
ventilation system have for a consequence a depression of respiratory
activity and the absorption of oxygen generally. Enough oxygen
gas finds its way slowly into the cells to keep the life-processes going,
of course, but not enough to complete the oxidations and decompose
the organic acids, at the prevailing low temperature, so rapidly as
before,* and thus another consequence is a tendency to the accumula
tion of organic acids. According to de Vries, however, the increase
of organic acids must make itself effective in enhancing the turgidity
of the cells, and no doubt it does so to a certain extent; beyond a
certain point, however, it is more likely to increase the permeability
of the protoplasm,t and we may even suppose small quantities of the
acids to filter out even to the watery cell-walls. 1
   Partly due to the low temperature and the depressed gas-inter
change, but far more owing to the feeble light, the process of
assimilation will be less active than previously. This will not be
 immediately felt       as will probably be the case, there are large

appear, however, the cells become more and more surcharged with

420         Prof. H. Marshall Ward.                The Relations between
that the increased amount of organic acids is favourable rather than
otherwise to the ferment processes which lead to the conversion of
the starch into glucoses.* How far the protoplasm will allow the
watery solution of glucose to escape, owing to its increased perme
ability, cannot be determined, but it is at least probable that some
may reach the cell-walls.             In any case, we have the cells flooded with
a dilute solution of organic acids and glucose, and the controlling
protoplasm becoming less and less capable of retaining the excess.
     The turgid condition of the cells, and the diminished intensity of
the light,f will favour growth, and, in spite of a comparatively low
temperature, the organs may be extending more or less rapidly or
slowly.      If so, the tendency will bo for the very watery cell-walls to
become relatively thinner than usual, as well as watery, because the
ill-nourished protoplasm does not add to the substance of the wall in
proportion.       This being so, we have the case of thinner, more watery
cell-walls acting as the only mechanical protection between a possible
fungus and the cell contents.
     But this is by no means all that has to be considered, when the
conditions remain as above described.                   Sooner or later the glucose
begins to fail, either because it has been directly employed for the
support of the metabolic processes in the protoplasm in the immediate
neighbourhood, or (less probably) because it has been re-converted
into starch, for other reserve carbohydrates by the leucoplasts in the
cells of the roots, tubers, &c., at a distance.                     Now, as soon as a
want of carbohydrates makes itself evident in the destructive meta
bolic processes accompanying growth, the accumulation of substances
like asparagin, leucin, &c., is apt to occur,§ as products of the de
composition of the proteids. Under more normal conditions, as we
have seen, these amide-bodies would be worked up again with carbo
hydrates into new constituents of living protoplasm, but they now
begin to accumulate.
     The net result of the foregoing changes amounts, shortly put, to
the    following : — Under certain circumstances the parenchymatous
tissues of the living plant may be in a peculiarly tender, watery
condition, where the cell-walls are thinner and softer, the protoplasm

because   the more refrangible rays are fewer when the light has to traverse a thick

is more permeable and less resistant, and the cell-sap contains a
larger proportion of organic acids, glucose, and soluble nitrogenous
materials than usual. When the external conditions become more
favourable — the temperature higher, the air drier, and the sunlight
more powerful — increased transpiration and respiration lead to more
normal metabolic activity, for which energetic assimilation provides
the materials. Of course, all kinds of combinations are possible in
detail, but when dull, cold, wet weather prevails for some time, after
a period of bright, hot, and dry weather in the early summer, we are
very apt to have herbaceous plants in such a condition as that

a very extraordinary kind, though caused by a fungus belonging to a
well-known and widely-spread family. This disease, and the fungus
in question, may be met with in nearly every garden and greenhouse
all the year round, and is quite common in the open fields and lanes
of this country and elsewhere in Europe. In the form generally met
with, the fungus has been placed in a separate genus known as
 Botrytis, though, in the few cases that have been thoroughly worked
out, it has been proved that the mould-like Botrytis is only the
conidial form of certain higher ascomycetous fungi belonging to the
Pezizas, and which agree in developing sclerotia.              As we are not con
cerned with the details of the whole life-history of this group, I shall
purposely avoid further reference to the higher stages of development,
confining our attention chiefly to the Botrytis stage.*
    On dead and dying leaves, twigs, fruits, &c., of plants from all
parts of the world, in the open and in greenhouses, in Europe and
elsewhere, there is often to be observed an ashen-^rcy mould, super
ficially not unlike the Phytophthora of the potato-disease.             It appears
under various slightly different aspects as regards the shade of colour,
the length and degree of branching of the conidiophores, and the size
and shape of the conidia, and many different species have been figured
and described, some good, many bad, according to the variations in
colour, size, &c., referred to, and the substratum on which the mould
is found growing.
    It sometimes happens, however, that this same mould is found

with references to any special forms, excepting in so far as the cita
tion of authorities necessitates this.
    In the first place, the mycelium and conidia are not only capable of
growing and flourishing in artificial nutritive media, but they often
refuse to do otherwise — at least while young. If the conidia are
sown in such media as the juice of grapes or other fruits, or in solu
tions containing an organic acid, sugar, asparagin, and traces of
mineral salts, enormous cultures may be made for weeks, and millions
of new conidia, sclerotia, &c., obtained, provided certain conditions
are fulfilled.      Among these conditions are the following : — The
temperature must not be high, and may be relatively low (best about
15° C.) ; the solution must not be alkaline or neutral, but should be
somewhat acid ;* sugar of some kind — and preferably a glucose —
must be present ; and the nitrogenous materials may be offered as
asparagin or peptone with advantage.
     It will be noted that just those external climatic conditions which
we have seen to be disturbing to the well-being of the green host-
plant are either favourable to the fungi we are concerned with, or are
at any rate not in the least inimical to their development.
     Thus the oxygen respiration of the fungus goes on at all tempera
tures from 0° C. to 30° C. and higher, and, although we still want
information as to details, experiments have shown that the mycelia
flourish at temperatures considerably below the optimum, for higher
 plants.f
     Moreover light, so indispensable for the carbon assimilation of the
 green host, is absolutely unnecessary for the development of the
 fungus.   J
     Then, again, the dull, damp weather and saturated atmosphere, so
 injurious to higher vegetation if prolonged, becauso they entail inter
 ference with the normal performance of various correlated functions,
as we have seen, and render the plant tender in all respects, are dis
 tinctly favourable to the development of these fungi.
      Consequently the very set of external circumstances which make
the host-plant least able to withstand the entry and devastation of a
 parasitic fungus like Botrytis, at the same time favour the develop
 ment of the fungus itself.
     As already said, it had long been assumed that these forms of
 Botrytis are saprophytes, and the ease with which they may be culti-

vated    in artificial solutions,       as above, tended     to support that view        :
moreover,      many attempts to directly infect living plants with the
conidia    failed  — the conidia, if merely placed in a drop of water on a
healthy leaf, simply germinated and died, and very often nothing
more came of it. Nevertheless, odd instances of infection were
recorded here and there, and the whole matter became a great
puzzle,* until several points of startling importance came to light.
    In the first place it turned out that, although the germinal tubes of
certain of the Peziza-forms could not penetrate into the living leaf
of the host directly — whereas they plunged forthwith into the tissues
of a dead organ J — nevertheless the mycelium developed from such
 spores, provided it was vigorous and well nourished by previous
 culture as a saprophyte, could do so, but in many cases only provided
 the tissues of the host were in a favourable condition.                      This last
 proviso was found to be necessary, because in some cases the my
celium easily infected young growing internodes, &c., but could not
 penetrate into the more fully developed older parts of the same plant.                 J
 This threw some light on the curiously capricious behaviour of the
 fungus in green-houses, where seedlings, cuttings, young internodes,
 &c., were often attacked and destroyed, while older parts escaped,
though without any regularity of behaviour.
    The key to the mystery appeared to be offered when it was dis
covered that the invigorated mycelium, well nourished by cultivation
in a solution such as that mentioned above, excretes a ferment which
possesses the power of swelling and dissolving cellulose, and that this
ferment is formed at the tips of the hyphae,§ and thus enables them to
enter the cell-walls, as they were actually seen to do. It becomes
intelligible now why these hyphro sometimes can and sometimes
cannot    quickly enter the cell-walls of a plant : when the cell-walls
are thin and watery, and especially if small quantities of organic
acids are present, the fungus hyphae can (easily attack and dissolve
them, but in cases where they are thick and tough, owing to paucity
in water and no traces of acids, the hypha has no chance. Just such
differences as these would occur in the case of young and old organs
respectively, or of partially etiolated or thoroughly matured tissues
respectively.
    But in addition to piercing the walls, and at first living in the
   * We   shall see that the occasional infection depends on (1) condition of host, (2)
whether any soluble food-materials pass from the leaf into the drops of water, and
(3) the state of the conidia.

cellulose substance,* the hyphae also excrete a soluble substance which
kills the protoplasm (with which they are not in contact) of the cells

separate zymase, or whether it is the same soluble ferment as that
which swells the cellulose, is not clear, or whether the protoplasm
simply dies after excessive plasmolysis due to water passing into
the swollen walls, but it is clear that some such poisonous action is
exerted at a little distance from the tip of the hypha, and therefore
by means of a soluble poison or zymase of some kind. It is difficult
to decide what this poison is, and the following questions arise : —
first, Is the poison the same zymase as that which causes the
swelling and solution of the cellulose ? This must be denied pro
visionally, at any rate, because if sections of the tissues arc put into
solutions containing extracts of the mycelium which have been pre
viously boiled for a minute or two, the protoplasm contracts and dies
much as before, though the cellulose walls no longer swell as before
because the zymnso has been killed by the boiling.                        This experi
ment is not quite conclusive, because the contraction of the proto
plasm may be due to the action of bodies in the boiled extract which
did not exist in the freshly expressed liquid. f

428         Prof. H. Marshall Ward.               The Relations     between
    The next question which arises is — Is there any definite body in
the extract that could kill the protoplasm, and which would not be
destroyed by the short boiling ? The answer to this question is
simple : the hyplus of the fungus develop large quantities of oxalic
acid* in the substratum, and this is a substance which is peculiarly
poisonous to the living protoplasm of higher plantsf if present in
any large quantity.           In the normal cells of plants rich in salts of
oxalic acid (Oxalis, Begonia, &c.) I need only remind you that the
acid is not in the protoplast, but is kept strictly isolated from it by
the vacuole wall, as is clear from the researches of Pfeffer and Dc
Vries.
    It is at least conceivable, therefore, that the hyphm kill the cells by
flooding the protoplasm with oxalic acid ; but it is not certain that
they do not excrete a more subtle poison of the nature of a ferment.
    In any case, it is a significant fact that the hyphae kill the cells by
emitting some soluble poisou which causes the protoplasm to collapse,
and then to turn brown, clearly because it destroys its power of re
taining and restraining the sap in the sap-cavity ; the latter there
fore escapes through the now permeable dead or dying protoplasm,
and owing to its acid contents, chromogcues, &c., stains it and the
cell-walls brown as the oxygen of the air enters into combination.
    There is thus, from the very first, a struggle between the hypha of
the fungus and the cells of the host ; the hypha is in the position of
an attacking party, which has to overcome, first tbe outworks, in the
shape of cuticle and cell-wall, and secondly the real fighting force—
the protoplasm.
   I   take it that the attacking hypha (invigorated by previous
culture, as said) excretes various zymase-like substances formed in its
metabolism ; one of these succeeds in overcoming the resistance
afforded by the cuticlej and then the cell- wall is penetrated :
the partially        victorious hypha then advances in the cell-wall,
and is nourished by the cellulose which it goes on dissolving,
and under its changed conditions of life excretes in increasing
quantities yet another zymase or some kind of poison which diffuses
to the protoplasm.          Now comes the real tug of war — so long as the
outer layer of the protoplasm (the ectoplasm) is in a position to
refuse access to, or in any way to destroy, tbe poison, the rest of the
protoplast remains impermeable, and the hyphae keep to the cell-
   * Dc Bary   observed    the same in the case of Peziza scUrotiorum    {op. cit., pp. 390

walls   ;  but as soon    as the  protoplasm of a cell succumbs, it signifies
its   defeat by collapsing, and then its own more or less acid cell sap
filters through to the walls and hyphse. If this view is correct, and
the evidence supports it entirely, it is clear that any variations in the
host-plant which lead to weakening the outposts — cuticle and cell- wall
—or     diminishing the fighting power of the protoplast, increase the
advantages oE the hypha to a corresponding extent; and we have
seen that such variations exist when circumstances cause the cells to
become more watery and turgid, the cell-walls thinner and softer, and
so forth. But, no doubt, the most important event is the lowering of
the resisting power of the protoplasm, as must happen whenever
external changes — such as low temperature, murky weather and a
saturated atmosphere, &c. — combine in lessening the activity of
respiration and assimilation, and consequently bring about the accu
mulation and possible filtration of organic acids, glucose, aspa-
ragin, &c. ; for, in the first place, the lowered metabolism means less
resisting power, no matter what hypothesis we adopt ; and, secondly,
the organic acids themselves prove an internal source of weakness if
they become too abundant, and filter through the partially dis
organised protoplasm.          The protoplasm, then, has its powers di
minished or destroyed by the accumulation and inhibitory action of
 products of its own activity.
    Fortunately, however, we have something more than the above
evidence, strong as it is, to support this view.                  Miiller-Thurgau
found, in the case of grapes devastated by Botrytis cinerea* that the
 Botrytis mycelium lives on the sugar, acids, and soluble nitrogenous
substances of the living cells ; but he also ".liscovered, by means of
numerous comparative analyses, that the mycelium consumes espe
cially the organic acids, the sugars to a less extent, and the soluble
nitrogenous matters were all converted into insoluble nitrogenons
substances. f No doubt some of the destruction of the acids is to be
put down to direct oxidation, but much is due to assimilation by the
fungus.      Similar events were found to occur when the Botrytis was
cultivated as a saprophyte on the juice of grapes.
    It is, however, not difficult to give experimental proof of the accu
racy of the statements that the entrance of the hypha into the cell is
dependent on the condition of the protoplasm.
    If the mycelium of one of these fungi is placed on an uninjured

   t Penicillium behaved very differently : it took the sugars in greater proportion
than the acids, and left the juices more acid than before. Botrytis, on the other
hand, left the juices less acid than before, and more concentrated owing to the
evaporation of water from the injured grapes, and it is interesting to note that
these diseased (so-called edelfdule) grapes yield the best and sweetest wines of the
Rhine district.

430          Prof. H. Marshall Ward.             The Relations between
living carrot, or turnip,* and the whole placed in                     a moist atmo
sphere, &c., the hyphae do not at first enter the tissues as above de
 scribed, but form a dense mycelium on the surface, and branches
 from this slowly penetrate into the interior, producing the symptoms
 referred to. If the carrot or turnip is first submerged for half a minute
 into boiling water, however, the hyphae plunge into the outer cells
 (the protoplasm of which has been killed by the hot water) at once.
 These facts are easily explained when we recognise that the hot
 water causes plasmolysis of the cells, and escape of the sap into the
 intercellular spaces, cell-walls, &c. ; in short, destroys the fighting
 power of the protoplasm against the hyphee.                  Moreover, the latter
 are invigorated by their saprophytic nutrition, and are able to excrete
 such quantities of ferment that the still living cells deeper in the
 tissues are unable to withstand the attack.
     Equally conclusive is the following experiment : —
     A mature firm shoot of a Petunia was infected with the mycelium,
 and the hyphae penetrated into the cortex about 1 cm., and then
 grew no further ; evidently because the cell-walls were thick, and
 their protoplasm disposed of the poisonous zymase as fast as it
 reached them. When the infection was made on slightly etiolated,
 rapidly growing shoots, however, the fungus entered at once, and
 destroyed the entire shoot off-hand.             f    This is explained by the
 thinner, watery cell-walls, and the less vigorous protoplasm, more
 acid cell-sap, and so forth, of the latter offering less resistance to the
 zymases or poison execreted by the hyphae.
     Another excellent case is the following.               During the very wet,
 cold, and dull weather of the summer of 1888, plants suffered a good
 deal from such diseases as we are discussing, and the white lily-
 buds were utterly destroyed in my neighbourhood by an epidemic of
 Botrytis,% aggravated by the low rate of transpiration, and conse
 quently retarded respiration and metabolism, and the diminished
 assimilation leading to paucity of carbohydrates. The cell-walls were
 thin and watery, the sap unduly charged with acids, &c., and the
  protoplasm of the cells less capable of dealing with the poison emitted
 in larger and larger quantities by the hyphe of the invading fungus.§

 at the time mentioned, but considerably more difficult to do so when

 Invigoration of Mycelium and Conidia by Saprophytic Mode of Life,
              and Differences in Behaviour of Successive Generations.
      We have seen from the foregoing that the relations of the host to
 the parasite may depend very much on the condition of the former, as
 induced by the complex action of the environment. I have now to
 show you that the variations from a normal which culminate in an
 epidemic are not confined to the host; but that the parasite also
 exhibits phenomena leading to the same result.
      That the mode of nutrition influences the vigour and size, &c., of a
 fungus is a fact well known ; but it is a comparatively recent dis
 covery that certain fungi, usually saprophytic in their habits, may be
 educated as it were to parasitism.* Thus, Penicillium glancum, usually
 regarded as the type of a saprophyte, causes rotting in fruits, bulbs,
 &c, when its spores penetrate into a wound in the living organ ;t
 and many other fungi usually met with as saprophytes are capable of
 assuming a parasitic mode of life if opportunity arises,J e.g., species
 of Mucor, Pythium, Nectria, Agaricus, &c.
      The most instructive of all is the genus Botrytis, however, for it is
                                                                            "

 tis cinerea, long known as a common saprophyte on fallen dead
 vine leaves, passes from the rotting debris on the ground to the
healthy living leaves of several plants and develops spots on them ;
and the same fungns has been found as a parasite on the male in
florescences of junipers, thujas, and other Conifers, || as well as else
where. But a still better case than any of these is the occurrence of

 432           Prof. H. Marshall Ward.              The Relations   between
 of the flowers, especially the stigmas and anthers, by means of spores.
 After growing ontside the organs for some time, the hyphae — now
 invigorated by their saprophytic nutrition — were able to enter other
 tissues, e.g., those of the leaves, pedicels, &c.          Experiments were then
 tried with Echeveria metallica* with complete success, and it may be
 remarked that this disease is very common in a sporadic form on
 Crassulacae in green-houses.            Infections of Lilium were also successful,
 and Hemerocallis fiava was destroyed with extraordinary rapidity.
 Many other plants were also infected successfully.
     In all these cases the spores only infected (directly) the most delicate
 or least protected parts of the flower, but the resulting mycelium
 when invigorated by its growth in the dead tissues was capable of
 directly infecting the ordinary tissWes of plants.
     It will be remembered that de Bary came to a similar result with
 bis experiments^ and             I  have observed the same phenomenon over
 and over again with several of these forms.                   There is one, for in
 stance, which sometimes cases great havoc among suowdrops in the
 early Rpring, and I found that the infection occurred especially by
 means of small invigorated mycelia developed from spores which ger
 minated on the dead tissue of the sheaths at the base of the leaves;
 these hyphae easily penetrated into the etiolated bases of the leaves
 and young flower-buds, especially when the plants were partially
buried in suow.        J   Similarly with onions, hyacinths, and other plants ;
and similarly in every greenhouse on plants too far from the light,
 and often in store cellars on etiolated geraniums, calceolarias, and
 other plants put by for the winter.
     But a still more remarkable proof of the influence of nutrition on
 the fungus is shown in the recent discovery that the conidia of suc
 cessive generations of the Botrytis have different powers of infection.
     It has already been pointed out that the conidia may or may not
 directly infect the tissues, and that one set of events affecting this is
the condition of the tissues themselves : another, however, is the kind
of food-materials on which the mycelium is growing which yields the
conidia.       I  have found that if the attempt is made to infect a carrot
with conidia taken directly from the Botrytis growing on artificial
solutions it often fails, whereas the conidia produced on the carrot as
a substratum succeed more easily ; moreover, there was so much
variability in the infections, and especially in the rate of progress of

everything which promotes or retards the vigour of the mycelium. 1
regard the conidium as distinct from any vegetative piece of mycelium
chiefly in its capacity to form the necessary (cellulose-dissolving, Ac. )
ferment or zymase* in greater quantity or in a shorter time (with
respect to the size of the organ), and look upon its size, shape, and
colour, &c., as so many adaptations to the mode of life of the
fungus.
   Be this as it may, the conidia vary in infective power according
to their nutrition — i.e., according to the substratum on which the
mycelium grows — and according to the generation to which the coni
dium belongs, i.e. (as           I   interpret it), according to the increasing
vigour of the successive mycelia which produce the conidia.                    f
   This latter fact is best demonstrated as follows : A crop of conidia
is grown on a given pabulum, e.g., on the moist sclerotium ; the conidia

whence conidia again arise ; these are again sown on pears, and produce
a still more vigorous mycelium and crop of conidia, and so on. Calling
the first crop of conidia generation I, and the second crop generation
II, the third generation III, and so on, it was found that if the conidia
                  I
of generation are sown on similar leaves of a Sempervivum in a tiny
drop of sap they do not infect the leaf ; whereas those of generation II,
similarly sown, infect the leaf at once, and those of generation                   III
are still more virulent.
   Kissling,* who has paid special attention to this point, and has
carried the matter much further than other observers, measures the
infective power of the conidia by the size of the disease-spot they
produce in a given time.
   As I have shown, tho penetrating germinal hypha causes the cells
in its neighbourhood to collapse and turn brown, because the excreted
ferment or poison destroys the cellulose, and makes the protoplasm
unable to retain the sap, which consequently suffuses and browns the
area concerned.        Now it is obvious that the rapidity with which this
browning occurs may be taken as a rough measure of the progress
— and, therefore, of the destroying power — of the infecting hyphae,
other things being equal.          Well, Kissling took the necessary precau
tions, and set the conidia of succeeding generations I, II, and                III  to
work on the surface of various fruits and other parts of plants, of
course using the same substratum in any one series of experiments.

colour, were large enough to measure in millimetres, and by measure
ments on successive days he was able to judge of the progress of this
extraordinary race, and he comes to the conclusion that on the same
substratum the conidia vary, according to their generation, in their
power of destroying the tissues.        Those of the third generation, for
instance, not only germinate more rapidly and vigorously — indications
that they start in the race better equipped in the matter of food-
materials and ferment-yielding substances — but they also destroy the
cells of the host which they compete with more rapidly — which, no-
doubt, indicates that they are able to produce or manufacture more
poison in the same time.
Summary of     the Factors                   —
                            of an Epidemic Bearing of the Discussion     on-
                    other Parasitic Diseases — Conclusion.
   It will be clear from the foregoing that in the case of an epidemic
fungus disease, such     as we have been considering, there are several
classes of factors to be regarded, and     I may sum up the chief points
somewhat as follows.       First, we have  the  normal healthy host-plant,
with all its hereditary (internal) and adaptive peculiarities ; secondly,
we have the parasitic fungus, also with its disposition.            Then we
find, thirdly, that, apart from its inherent powers of variation, the host
is subject to variable external influences during its life, which may
produce such changes in the cell-walls and contents, &c., that the
plant approaches nearer and nearer the limits of health, wide as we
may regard these.      On the other hand, we have, as a fourth considera
tion, the parasite also varying under the influence of changes in the
factors of the environment, and its variations may, of course, be also
dangerous to its welfare ; but they may, on the contrary, be in such
directions that it is enabled to profit by the counter-variations of the
host.    When the combined effects of the physical environment are
unfavourable to the host, but not so or are even favourable to the
parasite, we find the disease assuming a more or less pronounced
epidemic character.
   It is not pretended that we have here a totally new idea, because it
has long been known that some organisms which bring about parasitic
diseases do vary in the intensity of their effects, and can be made to
do so artificially, and we know that some of the most brilliant results,
in biology have been obtained in connexion with certain lower
organisms ; but I have simply sought to show some of the links in
the chain of causes and effects in the definite case of certain epidemic
diseases of plants produced by the parasitism of some of the more
                                       I
highly developed fungi, and this, think, has not been done before.
If the preceding argument is admissible, new light will be thrown

not only on the cases of parasitism referred to, but also on the
behaviour of the host in its straggle for existence with the factors of
the inorganic environment, generally.
   The question as to how far this view of the matter may be extended
to other parasitic diseases of plants cannot be answered at present.
Obviously the reflections excited will suggest lines of enquiry, and               I
may appropriately bring these remarks to a conclusion by a few brief
comments on what is known as to the behaviour of other classes of
parasitic fungi in this connexion.
    Omitting the Schizomycetes, partly because they have a literature
to themselves, and partly because they rarely* occur as parasites in
the cells of plants, possibly owing to the acidity of the sap ; and the
Myxomycetes, of which Woronin's Plasmodiophoraf is the best and
most curious case ; we have pronounced parasites (capable of produc
ing epidemics) among the Peronosporece, one of which (PhytophtJwra
infestans) has been more studied, probably, than any other trne
fungus parasite, at any rate so far as its life-history is concerned.          J
    Much that has been stated in this lecture would, apparently, apply
to the potato disease, and in view of the extreme interest that neces
sarily attaches to that malady, I draw attention to the following points
of interest.
    Suppose we take a potato plant the leaves of which are very
slightly marked with minute disease spots, and divide it into two
halves as exactly alike as possible, and place each half in a tumbler of
water ; the two tumblers, with their half-plants, are then placed in an
ordinary room, side by side, at a temperature of about 20° C, and one
is covered close with a bell- jar and the other left uncovered.                In a
short time — often a few hours — the covered leaves become black and
rotten with the disease, whereas the uncovered one will go on looking
fresh for several days, though it also succumbs at once if covered. §
    The question arises whether the rapid spread of the fungus and the
rot it causes here are simply owing to the increased supply of water, as
the tissues become turgid in the saturated atmosphere under the
bell-jar ; or whether we have not here again, in addition, a case where
the diminished access of oxygen to the interior of the tissues of the
host results in an accumulation of organic acids and other substances
which make the excessively turgid cells and thin, watery cell-walls
more than usually easy prey to the parasite.                                     •
   • Exceptions   probably occur in the case of Wakker's hyacinth rot, the American

 438           Prof. H. Marshall Ward.            The Relations between
     I   ought to add, that if a potato plant is grown in a pot and kept
 under a bell-jar (untouched by Phytophthora) normally lighted, in the
 summer, the excessively watery dark-green shoots often develop
 hump-like outgrowths, composed of very large, thin-walled cells,
 which may be regarded as due to the excessive turgescence and
 hypertrophy of these cells.          Presumably they contain relatively large
 quantities of organic acids, &c., and everything indicates that such a
 shoot would easily succumb to the Phytophthora, as in fact it does.
    Kiihn long ago noticed* that there are two periods when the potato
shoot is most easily infected by the Phytophthora.                 The first is while
                 —
still young fully developed internodes are much more difficult to
infect than young growing ones, a fact well known and easy to con
firm ; the second period is said by Kiihn to occur after the tissues are
far advanced, at the end of July or the beginning of August, and
this would seem to be borne out by the experience of cultivators
generally.        I  am inclined to regard this second period as coincident
with the time when the plant is particularly rich in the products of
assimilation on their way down to the tubers.                 They travel chiefly as
glucose,      and   one consequence     of  the  abundance    of this carbohydrate,
and the increased metabolism it supports, is an increase in the
organic acids.         If wet and dull weather sets in when the tissues are
thus, so to speak, overflowing with such substances, the Phytophthora
is peculiarly favoured, and can spread through the plant with the
rapidity characteristic of an epidemic.             In the allied genus Pythium,
the phenomena are so similar that we may assume that the fungus
behaves like Peronospora : the species are often saprophytes, however.
    The question now arises, can these ideas be extended to the case of
other parasitic fungi ? It would be difficult to say with regard to the
Saprolegniece and the Mucorini, because so little is known of their
parasitism. As regards the Ascomycetes generally, we may expect
great differences in respect to types like the Gymnoascece, Rhytisma.
Hysterium, the Erysiphece and the Sphcerias, and they certainly
occur.
    Some Nectrias at any rate (fe.g., N. cucurhitula, N. cinnabarina, and
N. ditissima) behave so differently towards the host that we may
probably conclude that the mode of procedure is unaffected by such
variations on the part of the latter as have been sketched ; and the
same may be said of the wood-destroying Hymenomycetes {e.g., Agari-
cus melleus, Trametes       radiciperda, Polyporus sulphureus, &c.) .
    In all these cases the tree, as a whole, suffers in an indirect
manner : these various cankers and rots, &c., destroy, for the most

     piece of a longitudinal section of a bean-stem.     The zoospores (a) soon come
     to rest, and one was noticed at mid-day on an exposed cell (J), lying nearly
     over its nucleus.    At 12.30 this spore had begun to germinate and enter
     the cell (c). At 2.5 p.m. the germinal hypha had turned to the left, and com
     menced to bore through the side-wall with its tip (d). At e is shown the

   In the group of the Ustilaginece we have some of the most remark
able parasites known, and the relation of the host-plants (chiefly
species of Gramineae and Cyperaceae) to them must be very different
in detail.

      duced by the parasitism of the fungus Ustilago Maidit (Sorauer).
    In the more typical cases we find that the sporidia or conidia ger
minate in artificial nutritive media, and go on producing generation
after generation of their like,f and this undoubtedly occurs in the
open fields, &c.         Brefeld states that he has cultivated one form
through more than a hundred successive cultures in the course of a
whole year, and that this corresponds to about 1500 successive sprout-
                             J
series or generations, but towards the end of the period the germi
nating power of the successive conidia became weaker and weaker,
and at last failed.
   * The germinal    hyphse developed from the spores of such fungi often find their
way into the wood, cambium, &c., by means of wounds, caused by mechanical
breakage, the nibbling of mice, squirrels, the punctures of insects, frost-cracks, the
blows of hailstones, and so forth, which introduce us to a different aspect of the
relations between host and parasite.

    He also found that the conidia germinate, by developing a germinal
tube only at a given period, and not at any indefinite time they may
happen to be sown : consequently they are unable to infect the host
unless they happen to be on the proper spot at the right time.
    Now Kiihn showed long ago* that the infection of the cereal- by
                                            " collar " of the
 Ustilago can only occur near the                               young germinating
seedling, and although differences have arisenf as to the exact spot
in this region which alone can be infected, there is one point on which
all are agreed, namely, that the germinal tube can only enter the
young actively growing tissues in that region. Immediately the first
internode is completed, the seedling is proof against infection in the
open.    J
     That it is really a matter of the age and condition of the tissue
is beautifully demonstrated by Brefeld, who showed that if the
conidia are forced into the bud by means of a syringe, so that they
can germinate in contact with the embryonic cells at the growing
point, infection may be ensured at any time.
     But far the most interesting point about these fungi is that when
the germinal hypha is once inside the tissues it goes on growing with
 them, keeping between the cells.             Although we have almost no infor
 mation as to details here, it can hardly be doubted that the chief
 agent in maintaining the balance of position in this case is the living
                                                 I
 substance in the cells of the host ; bnt know of no explanation for this
 beyond the general one, that so long as the cells of the internodes are
 actively performing their normal functions, the hyphae have to be
 contented, so to speak, with a sort of suppressed existence in the
 intercellular spaces and middle lamella of the walls.
     True, when the young fruits begin to fill out, the mycelium accom
 plishes a sharp revenge by destroying the whole fruit ; but it is
 obvious that the relations which determine the epidemic or sporadic
 character of the disease are those between the tissues and the germinal
 hyphae and young mycelium, and there are great variations in these
 matters, even in the group of the TJstilaginem itself. §
     Very different again must be the relations in detail between host and
 parasite in the case of those Uredinece which cause epidemic leaf diseases,
 especially those which form haur(-oria,|| and it is almost impossible

     X This no doubt explains the fact that in a wet spring nearly all seeds with spores
  attached become infected, because the tissues remain in a youthful condition longer
 than in a dry season.

  to say anything about their nutrition beyond the general statement
  that they must have established such close temporary relations with
  the living cells of the host that their protoplasm and that of the host
  can go on absorbing nutriment from the same sources.                      This would
  seem    to  be  proved by     the  curious  phenomena of hypertrophy which
  they induce, e.g., the young shoots of Euphorbia cyparissias are entirely

       branches. The blister-like Jicidia are visible on the leaves at a and b (Hartig).
 imply that the cells are carrying out their functions in a modified
 manner, still they grow, divide, and evidently discharge their main
 duties much as usual.           Consequently it is impossible to believe that
 any    individual   cell  suffers   much direct injury, and at least the protor
plasm and nucleus, and even the chlorophyll corpuscles, &c., may re-
symbiotic connexion with the cells, and for somo time merely taxes them, as it were,
rather than injures them directly.      Of course, there is ultimate injury, and even
death, brought about in these cases ; but how much this differs in different cases is
evident from comparison of other fungi, like Peronospora paratilica, Podosptuera
 Castagnei, with Uredines        such as Hemiteia     vastatrix, Metampsora Goepper-

  entrance of the hyph.se or haustoria into the tissues is aided by any
   factors which cause the cell-walls to be softer or thinner than in the
   normal condition ; and it is certain that many failures by those who
   have experimented with Uredinous fungi are attributable to their
  sowing the spores on older, well matured tissues.
      We are here, however, abandoning the subject of the present
   lecture, because, in the first place, the phenomena just referred to
  appertain to sporadic rather than epidemic diseases, and because,
  secondly, they tend to the subject of symbiosis proper, where the rela
   tions between the host and the parasite have become so arranged that
  both may be said to benefit by the commensalism, as exemplified in
   the lichens, and some of the recently described cases of mutualism
  between fungi and the roots of Phanerogams.

      The following Papers were read   : —
  I.   " Preliminary Note on Supplementary Magnetic Surveys of
          Special Districts in the British Isles." By A. W. ROCKeE,
          M.A., F.R.S., and T. E. Thorpe, Ph.D., B.Sc. (Vict.), F.R.S.

      Daring: the summer of 1889 we carried out additional magnetic
 surveys of the Western Isles and the West Coast of Scotland, and of a
 tract of country in Yorkshire and Lincolushire.
     Both districts were selected with special objects in view. We had
found that powerful horizontal disturbing forces acted westwards
 from the Sound of Islay, from Iona, and from Tiree, and we had
-deduced a similar direction for the disturbing force at Glenmorveu
from Mr. Welsh's survey of Scotland in 1857-58. The whole district
presents peculiar difficulties, partly from the fact that local disturb
ance is likely to mask the effects of the regional forces, partly because
the normal values of the elements must be especially uncertain at
stations on the edge of the area of our survey.
     If, then, the general westward tendency of the horizontal disturb-

ing forces was due to some source of error, stations in the extreme
south of the Hebrides would in all probability be similarly affected.
If the directions of the forces were due to a physical cause, such as a
centre of attraction out at sea to the west of Tiree, then the disturb
ing forces in the Southern Hebrides would almost certainly be directed
southwards towards it.
   The observations made last summer prove (1) that the direction of
the disturbing horizontal force at Bernera, which is the southernmost
island of the Hebridean group, is due south ; and (2) that, as this
 point is approached from the north, the downward vertical disturbing
attraction on the north pole of the needle regularly increases, which
exactly agrees with the supposition that a centre of attraction is
being approached.
   There is, therefore, now no doubt that there is a centre of attraction
on the north pole of the needle to the south of the Hebrides and to the
west of Tiree.
   (3) In one of the maps communicated to the Society last year we
drew two lines, bounding a district about 150 miles long and 40 miles
broad, in Yorkshire and Lincolushire, and gave reasons for the belief
that a ridge line or locus of attraction lay between them.
   This conclusion has now been tested by means of thirty-five addi
tional stations, with the following results : — (1) At all stations (with
one exception) on or near the two lines, the horizontal disturbing
forces tend towards the centre of the district they bound.
   (2) The downward vertical disturbing forces are greater in the
centre of the district than at its boundaries.       In particular, there
are two well-marked regions of very high vertical force.
   (3) The greatest vertical force disturbances occur at Market
Weighton, where the older sedimentary rocks are known to approach
the surface, and at Harrogate, which is on the apex of an anticlinal.
   (4) The central ridge line runs from the Wash parallel to the line
of the Wolds to Brigg. Thence it appears to turn west, and reaches
Market Weighton via Butterwick and Howden. One or two addi
tional stations are, however, required to determine whether this bend
is real, or whether the line runs direct from Brigg to Market
Weighton.     From the latter town it passes to the limestone district
of Yorkshire and traverses its centre. It has not yet been traced
west of the line of the Midland Railway between Settle and Hawes,
but there is ground for believing that it continues to the Lake
District.
   Although, therefore, one or two points of detail remain for furthp,
investigation, the existence of a line of attraction 150 miles long is
proved beyond the possibility of doubt, and for about 90 miles its
position is known to within 5 miles.
   There are, then, even in those parts of England where the super

  in size with small counties,      and ridge lines or loci of attraction as
  long and almost as clearly         defined as the rivers.   Their course, is
 closely connected with the         geology of the districts   through which
 they run.
 II.   " The Variations occurring in certain Decapod Crustacea. —
         I. Crangon vulgaris." By W. F. R. WELDOn, M.A., Fellow
         of St. John's College, Cambridge, and Lecturer on Inverte
         brate Morphology in the University.             Communicated by
         Professor    M.  Foster,   Sec.  R.S.    Received March 20, 1890.
     It   is well known that two sets of animals, belonging to the same
 species, but living in different places, exhibit differences from one
 another by which they can, in many cases, be easily distinguished.
 But it is at the same time equally certain that the forces determin
 ing the differences between local races of the same species do not so
act as to produce the same effect upon all individuals of the same
race : for      I am aware of no case in which the individuals composing
any     race  of  animals — however small and isolated the area in which
 they live, however uniform the conditions which obtain throughout
that area — have been shown to resemble one another exactly in any
character.
     Since the adjustment of a local race to the average proper to it is
not complete, the question arises, whether it is not possible to deter
mine the degree of accuracy with which this adjustment is effected,
and the law which governs the occurrence of deviations from the
average.       The object of this paper is to give an account of certain
observations made at the laboratory of the Marine Biological Associa
tion at Plymouth, in order to determine, first, the average length of
three or four organs which admitted of accurate measurement, and,
secondly, the frequency with which the average length and every
deviation from it occurred in one or two local races of Crangon
vulgaris.
    In making this investigation, I have had the great privilege of
being constantly advised and helped, in every possible way, by
Mr. Galton. My ignorance of statistical methods was so great that,
without Mr. Galton's constant help, given by letter at the expenditure
of a very great amount of time and trouble, this paper would never
have been written.         I am glad to take this opportunity of expressing
my gratitude for his generous conduct.               I have also to thank
Dr. Donald MacAlister         for explaining   to me  many points connected
with the law of error, and for helping me in various ways.
                                                                2 L 2

   44fi             Mr. W. F. R. Weldon.               The Variations     [Apr. 17,
       Mr. Galton has,     as is well known, studied the frequency with which
   deviations    from    the average size of certain organs occur in man, in
   certain plants, and in moths.            The result of his investigations has
   been to show that deviations from the average size of the organs
   measured by him occur in every case with the frequency indicated by
   the law of error.         These results were, however, based on an investi
   gation   either  of  civilised   man, or of a domesticated animal or plant :
   and Mr. Galton has himself pointed out that in the majority of cases
   studied, the effect of natural selection is probably insignificant.          The
   similar investigations of Quetelet and others are also confined to
   civilised man.      It has, therefore, seemed worth while to attempt an
  investigation of the variations in the size of certain organs which
  occur in a species living in a wild state, upon which natural selection
  and the other destructive or plastic influences from which domestic
  animals and civilised man are alike protected may be supposed to act
  with full effect.
      In his recent work on heredity,* Mr. Galton predicted that selec
  tion would not have the effect of altering the law which expresses
  the frequency of occurrence of deviations from the average : so that
  he expected the frequency, with which deviations from the average
  size of an organ occurred, to obey the law of error in all cases,
  whether the animals observed were under the action of natural selec
 tion or not. The results of the observations here described are such
  as to fully justify Mr. Galton's prediction.
     These observations relate entirely to the lengths of organs, or parts
 of organs.       The measurements of these lengths were made either
 with a pair of compasses, in the case of the greater lengths, or in
 the case of smaller parts by means of a microscope, provided with
 cross- wires, and travelling on a screw of known pitch.                The results
 are,    I believe, accurate to within about O'l mm.               The edges of the
 parts measured were in many cases so uneven, and the' effect of the
 spirit in which the specimens were preserved was probably so con
 siderable, that a greater degreo of apparent accuracy in the measure
 ments would not have implied a more reliable result.
     In order to compare the organs of one individual with the corre
sponding parts of another individual of different size, it was evi
dently necessary to express the dimensions of each organ in terms of
 the length of the body of the individual to which it belonged.                 All
the measurements           used in this paper are therefore, expressed in
terms ot the total length of the body, which is taken as 1000.
     Having obtained measures of the length of an organ in a suffi
ciently large sample of individuals, the frequency with which the
various magnitudes occur may be conveniently exhibited in the fol-
                        *                               119 — 124.

 1890.]           occurring in certain Decapod Crustacea.              447
lowing way, which is that adopted by Mr. Galton : — The values ob
tained are sorted and arranged in order of magnitude ; then, at equal
distances along a given base, ordinates are erected equal in number to
the observations, one ordinate being proportional to each observed
value of the organ. By joining the tops of these ordinates, a curve is
obtained such as that drawn in fig. 2.
   If   the base-line of such a curve be divided into one hundred parts,
then the proportion of individuals measured, which possess the
organ from which the curve is constructed, of a size greater or less
than any given magnitude, can be readily ascertained.         For example,
in fig. 2, which shows the distribution of lengths of the carapace in
400   female shrimps from Plymouth, the ordinate, whose length is
256, stands at grade 20°, showing that 20 per cent, of the indi
viduals examined had the carapace longer than 256 (the body length
being 1000), while in the remaining 80 per cent, the carapace was
shorter than this.
   A curve constructed in the manner directed is nearly always sym
metrical about its middle point : and this point therefore closely
approximates to the average of the whole number of observations
from which the curve was constructed.            The value of the middle
ordinate    will always  be taken, in what  follows, as the average value :
it will, in accordance with Mr. Galton's notation, be spoken of as the
Median, and denoted by the symbol M. Each curve, therefore, gives
by simple inspection the average value of the organ to which it
refers.
   In estimating the deviations from the average which occur in each
case, the magnitude of the average itself is evidently of no im
portance : and the ordinates of the curve may therefore be considered
with reference to an axis passing through the point M, so that the
ordinate of M becomes zero. When measured from this axis, half
the ordinates of the curve are of course positive, the other half being
negative.
   If  the frequency, with which the observed deviations from the
average occur, obeys the law of error, then the curve just described
                                                           "
should be a " curve of error," whose " probable error is represented
by the ordinates at the 25th and 75th grades. These grades are the
boundaries of the first and third quarters of the base: they will,
therefore, be spoken of (again in accordance with Mr. Galton's nota
tion) as Quartiles, and will be denoted by the symbols Qj and Qs respec
tively.    In a perfectly normal curve, Qj and Q3 are of course equal in
magnitude and opposite in sign. In the observed curves there was
generally a slight difference between the two : and the mean value of
the two is therefore adopted as the " probable error," which will be
denoted by the symbol Q.
   In order to determine the correspondence between the observed

 448            Mr. W. F. R. Weldon.            The Variations         [Apr. 17,
 curve and the curve of error, the ordinates of the observed curve
 will be compared with those of the curve of error at certain fixed
 grades.
    This may be most conveniently done by considering the ordinates
 of the curve of error at those grades         as  multiples of the
                                                                      " probable

   It will be seen that, in order to compare a curve constructed from
a number of observations with a curve of error, the following process
is performed : the ordinates at the selected grades are determined,
and the observed value of M is subtracted from each of these.                 The
remainders, divided by            — Q3), should give the coefficients of
                           |(Qi                                                 Q
which appear in the above table.
   Such a comparison will now be made between the curve of error
 and the curves obtained from the measurements.
   The organs measured are four : the total length of the carapace ;
the distance from the posterior margin of the carapace to the front
of the median spine ; the length of the sixth abdominal tergnm ; and
the length of the telson.      The parts are shown in the accompanying
woodcut.

    In measuring   the length of the sixth tergum and of the telson,
 these organs were removed from the body ; so that the small portion
 of each which projects inwards into a fold of skin, and serves as an
 attachment for muscles, is included in the total length.
    The individuals measured were all adult females ; they were col
lected from widely separate places.        The first sample measured
consisted of 400 individuals from Plymouth Sound ; a second sample,
containing 300 females, was obtained from Southport by Mr. W.
Garstang ; and a third sample, of which 300 were measured, was
.sent to me from Sheerness by Mr. W. H. Shrubsole.
    Total Length of the Carapace. — The curve obtained by treating the
 total length of the carapace of the Plymouth specimens in the way
described is shown in the woodcut, Fig. 2. ,
                                  Fio. 2.
   It will be seen that the median ordinate has a length of 250-52,
which is therefore the value of M. The ordinate at 25° is 255-07 =
M + 455 ; that at 75° is 246'00 = M— 452; so that the mean value
     Q = 1(4-55 + 4-52) = 4-53.

   It will   be seen therefore that the average length of the carapace
in the     Plymouth specimens was 250-52-thousandths of the body
length, and that the frequency with which this length and the
various observed deviations from it occurred was almost exactly that
indicated by a curve of error whose prob. error = 4-53.
   In the above table, all the steps in the determination of the co
efficients of Q are indicated. To indicate all the steps in this deter
mination in the case of each race would involve a great deal of vain
repetition ; and, therefore, in the following table the coefficients
themselves are alone indicated.      It will be understood that the entry
opposite each grade in this table is found by subtracting the value of
M from the observed ordinate at that grade, and dividing the
remainder by i(Qi— Qa)- The value thus obtained should be the
coefficient of Q in the table of ordinates of a normal curve given on
page 448.      These coefficients are repeated in the last column of the
following table.

   The table shows that in all the races the coefficients of Q agree
fairly well with those indicated by the normal curve. When these
coefficients and the values of M and Q in each case are known, it is
evident therefore that the whole curve is known.
   The values of M and Q are as follows : —
               Plymouth                   M = 250 05    ;   Q = 453
               Southport                   M = 248-50    ;  Q = 3-17
               Sheerness                  M = 24751     ;   Q = 305
   It thus appears that not only does the average size of the carapace
differ in different local varieties, but the range of deviation from that
average differs also.         Nevertheless, the frequency with which the
observed deviations from the average              occur is in all the three
observed cases expressed by a curve of error.
   Since the variations observed in adult individuals depend not only
on the variability of the individuals themselves              (which is possibly
nearly alike in all races), but also upon the selective action of the
surrounding conditions — an action which must vary in intensity in
different places — the result here obtained is precisely that which
might be anticipated, and it is precisely that predicted by
Mr. Galton.
   The same features are presented by the curves derived from the
remaining sets of measurements.            The following tables give the data
for constructing curves of deviation of each organ.

   Results similar to the above have been obtained from measure
ments of a larger series of organs, and parts of organs, in Pandalus
annulicornis (two races) and Palcemon serratus (one race) ; but, at
 present, not more than 100 individuals of each race have been
 measured, and the curves of distribution of the magnitudes of the
 various organs are therefore more irregular than those given for the
shrimp.      In these cases, however, there is no constant deviation in
any direction from the normal curve.              There seems, therefore, no
reason to doubt that an extended series of measurements will show
that the variations of these animals obey the law of error as closely
as do those of Crangon.         I hope shortly to collect such a series of
measurements.
   It  seems, therefore, that     Mr. Galton's prediction is fully justified ;
and that (1) the variations in size of the organs measured occur with
the frequency indicated by the law of error ; and (2) the
                                                                   " probable

correlation given by Mr. Galton (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 45, No. 274,
pp. 135 et seq.) ; and the result seems to show that the degree of
correlation between two organs is constant in all the races examined,
Mr. Galton has, in a letter to myself, predicted this result. A result
of this kind is, however, so important to the general theory of
heredity, that    I   prefer to postpone a discussion of it until a larger
body of evidence has been collected.

III.   " Observations     on   the   Anatomy     and Development of
     Apteryx" By T. Jeffery Parker, B.Sc., F.R.S., Professor
     of Biology in the University of Otago, Dunedin, New
     Zealand. Received March 20, 1890.
                                 (Abstract.)
   The chief materials for the present investigation consist of a,
number of embryos of the three common species of Apteryx, which
naturally group themselves into ten stages (A- — K) ; an eleventh
stage (L) is furnished by a bird a few weeks old, a twelfth (M) by
the skeleton of an adolescent specimen, and a thirteenth (N) and
fourteenth (O) by odd bones of young birds ; the adult may be con
sidered as constituting a fifteenth stage.
   The embryos were, for the most part, well preserved, but not
sufficiently well for the purposes of exact histological study. The
single embryo belonging to stage A corresponds in most respects to
a chick of the fourth day.
   The author returns his sincere thanks to the Council of the Boyal
Society for the grant from which the expenses of the investigation
were defrayed, and also to those who have assisted him in various
ways.     His paper is illustrated with seventeen plates, depicting
the external form and anatomy of the various stages, and a number
of new terms are proposed in the description of the skeleton.
   The following account is abstracted from the author's summary of
results : —
   External Characters. — In stage C, corresponding with a sixth-
day chick, there is a well-marked operculum growing backwards
from the hyoidean fold, and covering the third (? and fourth)
visceral cleft. A rudiment of this structure is seen in the preceding
stage.
   In   stage  A, the limbs have already attained their permanent
position, so that, if the backward shifting of the appendages so
noticeable in the chick occurs in Apteryx, it must take place at an
unusually early period.
   From the first appearance of the feather papilla there are well-
marked pterylse and apteria, most of which can be made out with
tolerable distinctness in the adult.
   The wing of the adult has a well-marked pre- and post-patagium,
and amongst its feathers may be distinguished nine or ten cubitals,
two or three metacarpals, one mid-digital, and a row of tectrices
majores.     The barbicels of the feathers are slightly curved.
   The fore-limb passes through a stage in which it is a tridactyle
paw with subequal digits, followed by one in which it is a typical

   1890.]     On the Anatomy and Development        of Apteryx.         455
  wing with hypertrophied second and partially atrophied first and
  third digits.
     The nostril has acquired its final position at the end of the beak in
  stage E ; up to the middle of incubation the whole respiratory region
 of the olfactory chamber, from the anterior nares to the commence
  ment of the turbinals, is filled with a solid mass of epithelial cells,
  through which a passage is formed at a later period.
     At no stage is there any trace of the caruncle or " egg-breaker " at
  the end of the beak.
     Tlie Law of Growth. — A number of details are given with respect
  to the various proportions of the different parts at different ages.
     The Specific and Sexual differences observable in the three species are
 ,described.
     The Skull. — In stages A and B the only cranial rudiments present
 are the parachordal plates, continued cephalad into the prochordal
 plate, and the visceral arches.
     In stage C the trabecules have appeared, and are continuous with
 the parachordals ; the prochordal plate sends off paired processes
 directly upwards in the mesencephalic flexure and laterad of the
 third nerves.
     In stages E and F the pituitary fossa is pierced by three apertures
 in longitudinal series —the anterior, middle, and posterior basi-
 cranial fontanelles.     The middle fontanelle has disappeared in stage
 G, but the anterior and posterior are still recognisable in stages H
 and I. Through the anterior fontanelle the pituitary radicle passes.
     The medio-dorsal portion of the dorsum scllse arises as a distinct
chondrite, the prochordal cartilage, which in stages F and G is quite
 separate both from the trabecular and from the parachordal regions of
 the skull.
    None of the stages show a separate prenasal cartilage or inter-
trabecular ; if present as a distinct chondrite it certainly does not
extend further backwards than the anterior presphenoidal region ; the
posterior presphenoidal region is clearly formed from the trabecules.
    In stages D, E, and F the presphenoid is a vertical plate of con
siderable antero-posterior extent, and gives origin to a pair of large
orbitosphenoids.        In stage A the orbitosphenoids have begun to
atrophy,    and  in later stages are reduced to narrow bars of cartilage,
the presphenoid at the same time undergoing a great diminution in
antero-posterior extent.
    The olfactory capsules extend backwards to the optic foramina
mesiad of the eyes ; there is at no stage an interorbital septum.
    The turbinals are unusually well developed, and are divisible into
anterior, middle, posterior, anterior accessory, ventral accessory, and
mesoturbiual folds. Alone amongst these, the anterior accessory turbinal
is formed as a hollow invagination of the wall of the olfactory capsule,

not as a plate-like ingrowth ; its cavity contains a prolongation of the
antrum of Highmore.
    There are paired, rod-like Jacobson's cartilages, lying one on each
side of the rostrum in the vomerine region.
    In late embryonic life, and even in the adnlt, the quadrate articu
lates with the roof of the tympanic cavity by a double articular
surface.
    The hyoidean portion of the tongue-bone chondrifies late — subse
quently to stage G — and never ossifies.
    Tlw Vertebral Column. — As in other Birds, the atlas arises from a
post-occipital intercentrnm and a pair of neurodendrites.                   The axis
consists originally of seven pieces.         In both vertebrse each of these
elements ossifies separately.
    The way in which the notochord is constricted by the ingrowing
centrochondrites differs greatly in the various regions.
    The atlas and axis in a newly-hatched embryo differ far less than
in the adult from those of the other Untitle.
    Two intercentra are described in the caudal region.
    A new method of writing the vertebral formula of birds, is
adopted.
     The Sternum and      Bibs* — The development of         these parts seems to
show that the costal sternum does not originate by the union of all
four sternal ribs, but that it extends backwards independently of the
third and fourth ribs, meeting them in turn and becoming united with
them by joints.
    In some adult specimens the sternum bears a low, median                     ridge,
probably to be looked upon as a vestigial keel.
    The form of the adult sternum is very variable.
     The Shoulder Girdle. — Up to stage H the shoulder girdle is a single
cartilage ; during that stage the procoracoid and coracoid are differ
entiated by fenestration. The procoracoid degenerates into a liga
ment, which is sometimes present in the adult. The coracoid fenestra
may persist or may be filled up by a preaxial extension of the
eoracoid.
    Acromial, procoracoid, and acrocoracoid tuberosities are present.
    The coraco- scapular angle varies from 150° to 122°.                In stage E
the scapula is curved backwards over the ribs.                 In the same stage
the coraco- vertebral angle is 35° ; by stage H it has increased
to 90°.
    The adult shoulder girdle is subject to great variation, both in
form and size.
     The Fore-limb. — In the carpus a radiale, an ulnare, and the three
    * It is mentioned by the author that uncinate processes         " uncinates
                                                                (or              ")  are
present in the ribs of liinornis, some points in the structure of the foot of which
 bird are also described.

preaxial distalia are distinguishable in early stages.     The distalia
usually concresce with the second and third metacnrpals to form a
carpo-metacarpus, with which the radiale and uluare may or may not
become united.
   The pollex usually atrophies at an early stage, but a vestige of it
may persist.
   The manus is fairly constant in structure in A. australis and A.
Oweni, but is very variable in A. Bulleri.
   The Pelvic Girdle. — The pubis and ischium are nearly vertical     in
stages D and E, and gradually become rotated backwards.
   The post-ilium is already fully formed in stage D, the pre-ilium not
until stage G.
   The pectineal process is ossified equally from the ilium and the
pubis.
   The Mind-limb. — In the tarsus a tibiale, a fibulare, and a single
distale are distinguishable in stages D and E. In F a post-axial
centrale appears in the rudiment of the mesotarsal articular pad ; in
G it becomes chondrified, and in the adult ossified. A smaller pre
axial centrale is first seen as a distinct chondrite in stage L ; in the
adult of A. australis and A. Haasti (?) it was observed as a separate
bone in the preaxial moiety of the mesotarsal pad.
   In stage D the fifth digit is represented by an elongated meta
tarsal ; in E this has diminished in size, and in F undergone almost
complete atrophy.
   Muscles  of  the  Wing. — The following muscles are present in the
wing in addition to those described by Owen :—Brachialis anticus,
supinator, pronator, anconeus, flexor profundus internus, extensor
carpi uluaris, extensor metacarpi radialis brevis, extensor indicis
proprius, and flexor digitorum profundus. There may also be a
brachialis anticus accessorius, an interosscus dorsalis, and probably
a flexor carpi radialis.
   The biceps arises from the acrocoracoid, the triceps by. a long
head from the scapula and by a short head from the humerus.
    The Brain. — The mesencephal is unusually small from the first ; in
stages D — F the optic lobes are dorsal; in G they become lateral by
the transverse extension of the optic commissure or median portion
of the roof of the mesocoele ; in H they are already ventral, although
larger proportionally than in the adult.
    The diencephal becomes tilted backwards in later stages, its dorsal
 wall becoming posterior and the foramen of Mouro postero-dorsal
 instead of antero-dorsal.
    The anterior commissure and corpus callosum are large.
    The cerebral hemispheres are of unusual proportional length, and
 partly cover the cerebellum.
    The Eye. — A pecten is present during late embryonic life.

     Phylogeny. — The following            characters support the view that
  Apteryx is derived         from  a typical avian form capable of flight : —
      (a.)    The presence of an alar membrane or pataginm.
      (6.)   The presence of pterylae and apteria.
      (c.)   The presence of remiges and of tectrices majores.
      (d.)   The attitude assumed during sleep.
      (e.) The presence of two articular facets on the head of the
                  quadrate.
     (/.) The presence of a pygostyle.
      (</.) The extreme variability of the sternum, shoulder girdle, and
                 wing, indicating degeneration.
      (/*.)  The     occasional occurrence of a median longitudinal ridge or
                  vestigial keel on the sternum.
      (i.)   The     position of the shoulder girdle and sternum in stage E.
      (.;.) The presence of vestigial acromial, procoracoid, and acro-
                 coracoid processes.
     (k.) The fact that the skeleton of the fore-limb is that of a true
                 wing in stage F.
     (?.)    The early assumption of undoubted avian characters in (he
                 pelvis,
     (m.)    The     typically avian characters, both as to structure and deve
                 lopment, of the vertebral column and hind-limb,
     (n.) The fact that the brain passes through a typical avian stage
                 with lateral optic lobes,
     (o.) The relations of the subclavian muscle.
     On the other hand, the total absence of rectrices tells against this
 view.
     The following characters indicate derivation from a more general
 ised type than existing birds : —
     (a.) The characters of the chondrocranium, especially in the
              ,
                 earlier stages. Many of these peculiarities, e.g., the absence
                of an interorbital septum, may, however, be adaptive, and
                con-elated with the diminished eyes and the enlarged olfac
                tory organs.
    (6.)    The     presence of an operculum in early stages.      As, however,
                this structure has not been described in Reptiles, it either
                proves nothing or too much.
    (c.) The presence of a well-marked procoracoid in comparatively
                late embryonic life.
    (d.) The characters of the pelvis.
    On the other hand, in the following characters, Apteryx exhibits
greater specialisation than other birds : —

   (a.) The early assumption          of their  permanent position by the
            limbs.
   (b.) The late appearance and obvionsly degraded character of the
            hyoid portion of the tongue-bone.
   (c.)  The    position of the nostrils and the peculiar mode of develop
            ment of the respiratory section of the nasal chamber.
   (d.)  The   total absence of clavicles.
   Such characters as the position of the basi-pterygoid processes, the
broad vomer, and the presence of Jacobs'on's cartilages, being
paralleled in existing Carinatae, some of them even in Passerines, can
hardly be considered as of fundamental importance, since they may
be derived from a proto-carinate or from an early typical carinate
stock.
   Before considering the peculiarities in the development of the
sternum as of fundamental importance, it will be necessary to study
that of the flightless Carinatae, and especially of Stringops.
   The general balance of evidence seems to point to the derivation of
both Ratitae and Carinatae from an early group of typical flying birds
or Proto-Carinatce.

I. " On      a PneumaticAnalogue of the Wheatstone Bridge."
       By W. N. Shaw, M.A., Lecturer in Physics in the University
       of Cambridge. Communicated by Lord Rayleigh, Sec. R.S.
       Received March 31, 1890.
   When fluid flows steadily through an orifice in a thin plate, the
relation between the rate of flow, V, measured in nnits of volume of
fluid per second, and the head H (the work done on unit mass of            the
fluid during its passage) may be expressed by the equation : —
                                    H = RV2,
where    R   is a constant dependingupon the area of the orifice, If tbe
head be measured     in gravitation units, R is equal to l/2g&2a9, where
g is the acceleration of gravity, a the area of the orifice, and k the
coefficient of contraction of the vein of fluid, a fnctor which is
independent of the rate of flow.
   Let us suppose a current of incompressible fluid to be drawn in soc-
cession through two orifices, av a3, arranged one at each end of a
closed space, B, so large that there is no appreciable difference of head
between different parts of it and that the kinetic energy of the flow
through the one orifice does not affect the flow through the other.
By the principle of continuity, the flow V will be the same through
each    ofthe orifices, and we have for the head Hj between the
two sides of the orifice of entry, Hj = R,V9, and for the head H3
between the two sides of the orifice of exit, H2 = R2V3, where R, and
R2 are corresponding constants for the two orifices. From the defini
                "
tion of the term head," it follows that Hj + Ho(=Ij) is the total head
between the outside of the second orifice and the outside of the
first. We may therefore regard Hj and H2 as partial heads which
make up the total head      We may suppose that the head
                            tr.                                   hdueis
to a constant manometric depression maintained in a second large
closed space, A, communicating with the first space, Bj, by means of

 the second orifice.          If
                        now we have a third closed space, B2, likewise
 provided with two orifices,     03, av one of which, ait communicates
with the space A where the constant manometric depression is main
tained, while the other, <z3, is open to the same supply of fluid as that
which feeds av we get a second flow, V, which we may speak of as
being in multiple arc with the first, and to which the following
equations apply : —
                                        Hs = R,V's,
                                   H3 + H,   =   h.
     H3 and H4 are the partial heads for the second flow, and Rg, B,t the
 constants for the orifices 03, at respectively.
    We have, therefore, an arrangement for the flow of fluid analogous
 to the arrangement of the Wheatstone quadrilateral for the flow
 of electricity, the galvanometer circuit being supposed open. The
 head jj corresponds to the electromotive force of the battery, V2 and
 V'3, correspond to the electric currents in the two branches ;
 Iij, R2, Ry, Rj, to the four electrical resistances ; the spaces A, BL, B2,
 take the places of the brass connecting blocks of a Post Office box or
 the copper connexion pieces of a metre bridge. The partial heads,
 Hj, H2, H8, H4, correspond to the electromotive forces between the
 ends of the four several wires.      Making contact with a key in the
 galvanometer circuit would correspond to opening a tube of commu
 nication between the spaces Bj, B2, above mentioned, and the hydro-
 dynamic condition corresponding to no current through the galvano
meter would evidently be the condition of no flow of fluid through
the tube, and the galvanometer must be represented by some appa
                                                                                '
ratus for detecting a flow of fluid ; the detector need not, however, be
designed to measure a flow any more than the galvanometer need be
suitable for measuring a current. The condition for no flow in the
" galvanometer " tube is that there should be no head between its
ends ; this condition is satisfied if Hx = H3 or H2 = H4 ; from which
it follows that the condition is entirely independent of the total head,
jj, and depends only on the constants of the four orifices      we have, in
                                                                      ;

      It is evident that the practical realisation of this hydrodynamic
                                           We require simply a " source
                                                                            "

  and a " sink communicating, the one with the other, by two pairs
                 "
 of apertures in two separate boxes, which must be of such a size that
  the kinetic energy of the entering streams is practically completely
  dissipated in the boxes. The two boxes must also be connected by a
  tube in which there must be placed an apparatus for detecting the
  existence of a flow between the boxes.
      The hydrodynamic analogue suggested itself to me in the course of
  the study of a number of problems in ventilation depending upon the
  flow of air between nearly-closed connected spaces, for example,
  adjoining rooms.      In such cases the differences of pressure which
  produce the flow are very minute, amounting perhaps to a few
  hundredths of an inch of water, and the corresponding variations in
  the density of air may be safely disregarded. Under such circumstances
  the air will follow the laws of flow of an incompressible fluid, and equa
  tions identical with those quoted above will hold for the flow of air.
      Measurements made upon the flow of air in order to determine the
  coefficient of contraction have been hitherto such as may be termed
   "absolute"; that is to say, the head and the flow have each been
  separately expressed in absolute measure and the value of R deter
  mined by taking the ratio of the head to the square of the flow.
   This process is exactly analogous to measuring the electrical resist
   ance of a wire by finding the electromotive force between its ends
  and the current which flows along it.
      M. Murgue, in a work on ' The Theory and Practice of Centrifugal
                            '
. Ventilating Machines        (translated by A. L. Steavenson), has shown
   that the internal resistance of a centrifugal fan to the flow of air
   through it can be calculated from the effects produced on the flow by
   varying the size of a second orifice through which the air has to pass.
   This process is evidently parallel to calculating the internal resistance
   of a battery by finding the effect produced upon the current by vary
   ing the external resistance. The development of the electrical analogy
   seems to afford a novel method of comparing resistances to the motion
   of air, and of verifying the laws of flow, and one which requires only
   a detector and not an anemometer, and is independent of the con
   stancy of the flow. Whether it could be used practically to test the
    laws of flow and measure the pneumatic constants for various orifices
   to a higher degree of accuracy than has hitherto been attained,
   evidently depends upon the sensitiveness of the arrangement. In
   order to try this, I  have had constructed what may be called a pneu
    matic analogue of the Wheatstone Bridge. It is represented in fig. 1,
    and consists of three wooden boxes, A, Blt B2.

 1890.J            Analogue of   the Wheatstone Bridge.                 465
   A is 4 ft. x ft. x 1£ ft., and Bt and B2 are each 3 ft. x 1£ ft. x 1£ ft.
                \\
The ends of Bt and Bs abnt against the side of A, as shown in the
figure ; between Bj and A is a rectangular opening, a2, 1 in. x -J in.,
in a cardboard diaphragm, and between B2 and A a rectangular
opening, av 1 in. x 1 in., in a similar diaphragm.         In the side of
Bx at ax is an adjustable slit, made by cardboard shutters sliding in
cardboard grooves, and at o3 in the side of B2, opposite to ax, is a
similar adjustable slit. The tube connecting Bx and B2, or "galvano
        "
meter tube, is a straight tube of glass, G, of about    l'l  inch internal
diameter. It can be closed at one end by a small trap-door, D, in
the interior of the box Bj, which can be opened and shut by a steel
wire, S, passing through a cork in the top of Bx. The sensitiveness
of the apparatus depends upon the indicator employed.            There are
many indicators that might be employed ; the one        I have tried and
have  found   to work   well consists of two very small parallel sewing
needles, stuck through a cap of elder-pith, supported on a small
agate compass centre ; the needles carry very light mica vanes on
one side of the centre, counterpoised by a small quantity of platinum
wire.     The whole is balanced on the point of the finest needle   I could
obtain, and forms a very delicate wind vane.       When first mounted,
the needles always took up a position of equilibrium with the points

466               Mr. W. N. Shaw.        On a Pneumatic          [Apr. 24,
northward, although they had not been intentionally magnetised,
nor, indeed, exposed to any risk of their being bo from the time of
their being purchased.     They were, no doubt, very slightly magnetised,
but the time of swing was very long, and the position of equilibrium
not sufficiently definite.   I therefore magnetised them more strongly;
the little vane then took up, in consequence, a definite position of
equilibrium with the planes of the vanes approximately north and
south.    The apparatus being so placed that the tube, G, is east
and west, the vanes always set across the tube when there is no
current. The needle points enable the position of equilibrium to be
clearly identified by the aid of a fiducial mark on the glass tube.
The sensitiveness can be altered as desired by an external control
magnet, just as that of a galvanometer needle can be.            The little
compass    needle  or wind  vane,  M, is very  sensitive  to the motion of
air in the tube, and although it may be possible to find other detectors
that are equal, or even superior to it, yet the ease of seeing it, the
rapidity of its action, and its definite zero are decidedly in its favour.
    The head is produced by a gas burner in a metal chimney, C, fitted
to the lid of the box A.
    Various precautions are required in fitting the boxes together to
secure that the air should only flow through apertures intended for
its passage, but they need not here be detailed.       They consist mainly
in the plentiful application of glue and brown paper.
    The apparatus was designed when          I  was making a number of
observations of flow of air to illustrate the theory of ventilation, and
I  did not anticipate that any high degree of accuracy could be aimed
at.   I was, therefore, agreeably surprised to find that the identification
of the condition of no flow is capable of much greater accuracy than
the arrangements for measuring the areas of the orifices would allow
me to interpret.
    Of the four apertures of the bridge, two, viz., a2 and av are in
accessible without pulling the arrangement to pieces ; they represent
areas of ^ sq. in. and 1 sq. in., respectively, as accurately as a knife
could cut them in cardboard.
    The other two areas, viz., oj and 0j, are made by sliding shutters,
as already mentioned.       Their edges were cut with a knife, and they
probably are only rough approximations to areas in a truly thin plate,
 so that little importance can be attached to the final results of the
measurements which will be given below ; they serve only to show
that the width of the adjustable slit, when there is no flow through
the galvanometer tube, is a perfectly definite magnitude.
    The following observations have been taken with the apparatus : —

    As already stated,       Og  = 0-5 sq. in., at =      1 sq. in., so that if the law
 holds   og should    be   found    to be   equal   to  2al.     In testing the propor
tionality, ax was made successively equal to \, £, f, 1 sq. in., by the
 use of a cardboard wedge, 343 mm. length of which corresponds to
 1 in. breadth ; and
                          03 was adjusted till there was no flow through the
galvanometer tube, and the width measured by means of the card
board wedge.
    The measurements were referred directly to an inch scale by
 parallel-jaw callipers.

   These two values of the ratio Os/ot would be reconciled by assum

whose area is 0'925 of the circular aperture, and they, therefore,
throw doubt upon the idea that circular and square apertures have
the same coefficient of contraction, but the rectangular apertures were

not such close approximations to orifices in truly thin plates as to
warrant the acceptance of this result without apparatus of more
elaborate construction.      Moreover, there is a possibility of slight leak
in the grooves of the shutters, which ought not to be disregarded.
    The observations are, however, sufficient to show that a properly
constructed apparatus is capable of making measurements               of the
effective areas of orifices with a very considerable degree of precision.
It is well known that if the orifice be not an aperture in a thin plate,
but in the form of a tube, straight or bent, the flow through the
orifice can be represented by an equation of the same form as if the
orifice were a thin plate aperture, viz. : —
                                  H = RV',
but in the case of a more complicated orifice R cannot be so easily
calculated from the dimensions ; the value of R might, however,
be determined experimentally for an orifice of any shape and dimen
 sions by a pneumatic bridge of suitable size, and the result might be
expressed,      as M. Murgue suggests for the case of mines in the
 work already referred to, by stating the area of the thin plate
orifice to which the given orifice is equivalent. The comparison of
 calculated values of R with observed values obtained by a pneumatic
 bridge would enable us to determine a number of pneumatic con
 stants that are at present only comparatively roughly ascertained,
 such, for instance, as the coefficient of air friction in tubes of different
 diameters, the constants of different forms of orifice, the effect of
 bends and elbows in pipes, and of gauze or gratings covering an
 orifice.   And it would not,     I  think, be difficult to arrange the ap
 paratus   in  such a way  as to determine  the law of resistance of a disc
 to the passage of air and its variation with velocity. The velocity
 can be increased to any extent that may be necessary by using a
 centrifugal fan to produce the head instead of the gas burner.
    I  am intending, if possible, to have my present apparatus altered
 in some of its details, so that the orifices may be more definitely
 expressed in terms of thin plate apertures, and then to use it for the
 determination of some of the pneumatic constants I have referred to.

        Length in Wires of Iron, Nickel, and Cobalt." By Shelford

                                  Preliminary.
    A   former communication to the Royal Society (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,'
 No. 243, 1886, p. 257) contains an account of some experiments
 relating to the magnetic extensions and contractions of iron wires

470                  Mr. S. Bidwell.      On   the   Effect of Tension      [Apr.   24,
under tension.    Wires of several different sizes and qualities were
suspended inside a magnetising coil, and were loaded with various
weights ; and in each case observations were made of (1) the smallest
magnetising current which caused sensible change of length ;
(2) the current producing maximum elongation (if any) and the
value of such elongation ; (3) the critical current which was without
effect upon the length of the wire ; and (4) the contraction pro
duced by a certain strong current.
   The results indicated that the maximum elongation became smaller
as the load was increased, disappearing altogether when the tension
exceeded a certain limit ; and that contraction began to take place at
a correspondingly earlier stage in the magnetisation.
   These results were chiefly of interest as disproving Joule's conjec
ture, which has often been quoted as if it were an experimental fact,
that, under certain critical tension (differing for different specimens
of iron, but independent of the magnetising force*), magnetisation
would produce no change whatever in the length of the wire.
   The subject, however, seemed worthy of more complete investiga
tion, and      I
            have lately undertaken a series of experiments in which
the changes of length undergone by a stretched iron wire were traced
continuously as the magnetising force was gradually increased from
a small value up to about 375 C.G.S. units.      Similar experiments
were also made with a nickel wire and with a thin strip of cobalt,
the behaviour of these metals under tension never having been
previously studied.
                                        Apparatus.
   The apparatus employed was the one described and figured in my
former paper.     The diagram there given, together with a short
description,    for  is,

sary to support the magnetising coil in the manner shown in the
figure, its whole weight being borne by the experimental wire. The
minimum load on the wire was therefore represented by the weight
of the coil, together with the pull of the lever, the two amounting to
1'36 kilo.   Greater tension was produced by attaching weights to the
hook H.
   The iron used was a piece of soft annealed wire, 0*7 mm. in
diameter and 10 cm. in length, between the clamps. The weights
 *     At   least within the limits of the forces employed by Joule, estimated to ranpr
from   7    to 114 C.G.S. units. See Eoy. Soc. Proc.,' No. 242, 1886, p. 112.

   The magnetising coil, CC, is supported by a stopper, A, which is inserted into the
bottom of the coil. Through an axial hole in A is screwed a brats rod, terminating
in a stirrup, S, beneath which is fixed a hook, H, for the suspension of weights. A
second brass rod, suspended by a pin at P, passes freely through a stopper, B. The
wire under experiment, X, is clamped between the ends of the bras9 rods. The
knife-edge at the bottom of the stirrup acts upon a brass lever, R, one edge of which
turns upon the knife-edge D, the other actuating a short arm, E, attached perpen
dicularly to the back of the mirror M. The mirror turns upon knife-edges about
its horizontal diameter. By means of a lantern the image of a fine wire is, af I er
reflection from the mirror, projected upon a distant vertical scale and serves as an
index. Dimensions : — SD = 10 mm., DE = 170 mm., ME = 7 mm., distance from
mirror to scale = 4706 mm., each scale division = 064 mm., length of X = 100mm.

    The nickel wire was 100 mm. long, and 0-65 mm. in diameter ; it
was supplied by Messrs. Johnson and Matthey.                     The loads under

472            Mr. S. BidwelL      On the Effect    of Tension       [Apr.     24,
   The cobalt used was a narrow strip measuring 100 mm. by 2-6 mm.
by 0'7 mm. ; its cross section being, therefore, 1.82 sq. mm.             It was
not possible to obtain this metal in the form of a wire ; and for the
piece of thin rolled sheet from which the strip above-described was
           I
formed, am indebted to the kindness of Messrs. Heury Wiggin and
Co., of Birmingham, who had it specially prepared for me. The
loads employed for the cobalt strip were equivalent to 772, 344, and
75 kilos, per sq. cm.        The first of these was represented by an
actual weight of 31 lbs.,* which was as great as the apparatus seemed
capable of bearing without risk of injury.
   In all the experiments the loads were successively applied in
decreasing order of magnitude, and before every single observation
the wire or strip was demagnetised by reversals, without, of course,
being removed from the coil.f
   The results obtained for iron are given in Table I, and also shown
in the curves in fig.  2.
   Those for nickel are given in Tables       II and III, and in figs. 3 and
4. In fig. 3 the curve for 700 kilos, is represented by a dotted line
for the sake of distinctness. Table         III  and fig. 4 are constructed
from data obtained from a complete set of curves, like those in fig. 3 ;
they show the magnetic contractions that would occur under increas
ing loads in constant magnetic fields of 125, 185, and 360 C.G.S.
units respectively. These magnetic contractions would, of course, be
superposed upon elongations of a purely mechanical nature, due to
the tensional stress.
   The results for cobalt are contained in Table IV and fig. 5. In
the figure the contractions corresponding to the various loads are indi
cated by different kinds of marks, and a single curve has been drawn
as smoothly as possible through the whole of them.
   In all the tables and figures magnetic fields (which are those due
to the coil alone) are given in C.G.S. units, and increments and
decrements of length are expressed in ten-millionths of the length
(10 cm., or about 4 inches) of the experimental wire or strip. In
figs. 2 and 5, therefore, the height of each little square corresponds
to 1/10,000 mm., or 1/250,000 inch, and in figs. 3 and 4 to
1/2,000 mm. or 1/50,000 inch.

    Imn. — The curves in fig. 2 clearly show the effect of tension in"
 diminishing the maximum elongation and hastening the contraction.
 With the two greatest loads used there was no preliminary elonga
 tion at all.    The curve for an unstretched iron rod is generally
 found to cut the axis at about 300 ; probably, therefore, if the wire
 used in these experiments could have been tested with no load, its
 curve would lie a little above that for the load of 351 kilos.
    Nickel. — The results for nickel are of great interest.     In fields
 below about 140 units increase of load is always accompanied by
 decrease of magnetic contraction, the earlier portions of the six curves
 in fig. 3 following one another in inverse order of the magnitude of
 the several loads.     But, although the initial slope of the curves
 diminishes with increasing loads, the " turning points," where the
 ratio of the contraction to the magnetic field is a maximum, occur
 later with great than with small loads, so that in a field of 360 the
 order of the relative values of the contractions for the three smallest
 loads is actually reversed, the contraction being greatest with the
heaviest load and least with the lightest. It appears probable that,
 if the experiment had been carried far enough, the curve for
 1400 kilos, would have crossed one if not all of the three curves lying
below it. Whether the two remaining curves for 1890 and 2310 kilo.-,
would behave similarly is more doubtful.            Possibly they would
have become parallel to the horizontal axis before the others were
reached.
    I think it may fairly be assumed that if the experiment could have
been made with the wire quite unstretched, we should have obtained
a curve having a steeper initial slope than any of those in the

    A curve-plotted from this           table  will be foui:d to begin its descent
between the curve for 420                kilos,   and the vertical axis, and after
crossing the others to intersect that for 1400 kilos, at H = 355. But
of course experiments made with "two different specimens of nickel
are not strictly comparable.
    In fig. 4 the results for nickel are presented in a somewhat
different form, the curves showing the magnetic contractions of the
wire under various loads in certain constant fields. The values for
no load are taken from Table V", 'and the portions of the curves which
depend upon the accuracy of these values are distinguished by dotted
lines. It will be-seen, however/ that these portions are1 not of much
importance.
    From these curves we at once see that in a field of 125 units,
increase of load always oauses decrease of magnetic contraction.                         In
a field     of  185, magnetic contraction increases               as   the load  is raised
from nothing up to about 700 ^kilos. per square-urn. , again decreasing-
with greater loads. And in a field of 360 units this singular reversal
 is exhibited in a still more marked degree, the maximum magnetic
 contraction occurring 'with a load of about 9&0 kilos, per square em.
    The reversal phenomena observed in connexion 'with 'the magnetic
 contraction of nickel are strikingly analogous to those which-occur
in the magnetisation of a stretched iron wire, and which are com
monly associated with the name of Villari.f

1890.]           upon Magnetic Changes      of Length in Wires.             479
     Professor J. J. Thomson has shown* that the Villari effect is dyna
mically connected with the changes of length undergone by an iron rod
when magnetised, an iron rod being lengthened in a weak magnetic
field and shortened in a strong one. Now cobalt behaves oppositely
to iron in this respect, a rod of cobalt becoming shorter in a weak
field, longer in a strong one.f Professor Thomson, therefore, pre
dicted that a Villari reversal would be found to occur in cobalt and
that it would be of the opposite character to that in iron. Some
experiments made by Mr. ChreeJ with a cobalt rod under pressure
gave results in accordance with Professor Thomsoa's expectation.
     But no reversal of tbe effect of magnetisation in diminishing the
 length of an unstretched nickel rod has ever been observed.               Such
 a rod always becomes shorter in a magnetic field, whether strong or
 weak.       It appears to attain its shortest length in a field of about
 750 units, but it does not pass a minimum and become longer again
 in stronger fields, like cobalt.           Applying Professor Thomson's
 reasoning, therefore, to the case of nickel, we should expect that it
 would be found not to exhibit any Villari reversal, either of the
 nature of that in iron, or of that in cobalt.              Both Sir William
 Thomson and Professor Ewing have in fact looked for one and failed
 to find it.      But in a paper read at the meeting of the Physical
 Society, on 21st March, 1890,§ Mr. Herbert Tomlinson gave an
account of some experiments which, as he believed, showed that a
 Villari critical point really existed in nickel, though it was only to be
 reached by the application of comparatively great magnetising forces.
 If Mr. Tomlinson is right, 1 venture to suggest that his results may
 possibly be brought into harmony with Professor J. J. Thomson's
 mathematics by consideration of the experiments described in the
present paper : for, as I understand Professor Thomson's argument,
he has hitherto taken no account of the effects of mechanical stress
upon magnetic changes of length.
     Cobalt. — The results for cobalt show that tho changes of length
which this metal undergoes when magnetised are almost, if not en
tirely, unaffected by tensional stress, at least within the limits of the
experiments. Having regard to the very marked influence of tonsion
upon iron and nickel, this cannot but be regarded as a most re
markable fact.

    Iron. — Tension diminishes the magnetic elongation of iron, and
causes contraction to take place with a smaller magnetising force.
   Nickel. — In weak fields the magnetic contraction of nickel is di
minished by tension.       In fields of more tban 140 or 150 units, the
magnetic contraction is increased by tensional stress up to a certain
critical value, depending upon the strength of the field, and dimin
ished by greater tension.
   Cobalt. — The magnetic contraction of cobalt is (for magnetic fields
up to 500 C.G.8. units and loads up to 772 kilos, per sq. cm.) practi
cally unaffected   by tension.

    Soon after I had completed the radio-micrometer and shown its
great superiority over any form of thermopile and galvanometer, I
was naturally anxious to carry out some research which would
clearly demonstrate the capabilities of the instrument.                The deter
mination of the heating powers of the stars seemed most promising,
for Dr. Uuggins had, in 1869,* made experiments on the heating
powers of some of the stars which, though they did not conclusively
show that a thermopile was capable of measuring so minute a radia
tion, yet made it exceedingly probable that the effects observed, if
not very exact in quantity, were at any rate real. Dr. Huggins, how
ever, described hia experiments and formed his conclusions with the
 utmost caution.    A year later Mr. Stone described experiments which
he had made with the great equatorial at Greenwich. f He at firs,t
used small thermopiles, but soon found, as we should expect, that a
 single pair was more sensitive to radiation brought to a point
than a pile of many pairs.       In attempting to obtain great sensibility
by giving    the galvanometer a long period he found it almost im
possible to use the apparatus on stars at night.              Every slight change
in the sky, even though quite invisible to the eye, so disturbed the
galvanometer that it was impossible to distinguish effects due to the
 stars from those caused by the varying clearness of the sky". Mr.
 Stone largely obviated this difficulty by placing in the focal plane of
 the object glass a couple of thermo-electric pairs so connected that a
 heating of the exposed face of one would produce an effect opposite

 in kind to that produced by a heating of the exposed face of the
 other. Under these conditions a change in the sky which would act
 on both faces alike, or nearly so, would not disturb the galvanometer,
 whercHs a star made to shine first on one face and then on the other
 would cause a deflection first in one direction and then in the other.
 This arrangement had previously been employed by Lord Rosse, in
 his experiments on the heat of the Moon.*                    The pairs used by
 Mr. Stone were about 31 mm. long and had a sectional area of
 about 4 square mm., that is, each bar was about 31 x 2 x 1 mm.
 Wires were taken to a distant galvanometer and the telescope was set
 with the image of the star alternately on the two faces. About
 10 minutes were allowed before a reading was taken. The rays of
 Arcturus concentrated      by the 12|-inch object glass produced devia
 tions of from 20 — 30 divisions of        the scale, while a 3-inch cube of
 boiling water at two feet from the faces produced a deflection of
 about 150 divisions. Mr. Stone concluded that the face of the pile
 was heated through about l/50th of a degree Farenheit.               With these
 figures before me, I had no doubt that the radio-micrometer, which in
sensibility vastly exceeds the thermopile, while unlike the thermopile
and galvanometer it is free from disturbing effects of magnetism
and outside changes of temperature and has the further advantage
 — and for astronomical work this perhaps is even more important —
that a measure can be made in Jive seconds instead of several minutes
which are necessary with the older apparatus, would be capable not
only of making good and exact measures of the heat of the brighter
stars, but I went so far as to hope that even faint stars would pro
duce an appreciable effect and that most interesting results might Ik<
derived from an examination of planets, comets, nebulse, and the red
stars.
    I therefore determined to put the radio-micrometer to a severe
test, and one which promised not only to show its suitability for such
delicate work, but at the same time to give much valuable informa
tion. The Royal Society gave me, out of the Government Grant, a
sum of £50, which, thanks to the advice which 1 received, espe
cially from Mr. \V. H. Massey, and Mr. A. A. Common, in the
matter of design and construction, was nearly sufficient to meet all
the expenses which I have incurred,                   I should say also that
Mr. Paxman, of Colchester, who made the steel tube, which is a
beautiful example of miniature boiler construction, kindly presented
this in the cause of science ; that I have been able to use some few
pieces of apparatus belonging to the Physical Laboratory, at South
Kensington, such as the large magnet of about 25 lbs. for the radio-
micrometer, some of the lime-light apparatus, and the finder ; and,

finally, that Dr. Huggins has kindly lent me a silver-on-glass mirror of
nearly 16 inches aperture and very short focus (67'8 inches) of his
                                                I
own construction, which was exactly what wanted for this purpose.
I accordingly prepared a design for a monntiug of this mirror, such
that, no matter in what direction the telescope might he pointed, the
focus of the rays from a star should he always at one fixed point at
which the receiving surface of the radio-micrometer could be sus
pended.      I should say here that in this one particular the radio-
micrometer is at a disadvantage by comparison with a thermopile or
bolometer    ; it must not be tilted, it cannot be fixed into an eyepiece
and pointed and moved about at will ; it must be level, though it
may, with its lamp and scale, be carried on a level platform and
turned about a vertical axis.        This disadvantage, which, however,
disappears when the whole apparatus is designed for and is made to
suit the radio-micrometer, is more than counterbalanced by the
absence of connecting wires with a thcrmo-eleotrie junction at every
binding screw and by the absence of the galvanometer, which is ever
ready to give indications on its own account.
    In the design of the mounting       I  have, to a large extent, been
obliged to follow certain lines. Thus it is evident, if a large sidero-
stat is not to be had. so that the telescope may be fixed, which would be
the most convenient plan to adopt, that, the mounting must be
altazimuth, that the horizontal and vertical axes of. motion must in
tersect, and that the focus, which must be jnst outside the tube, must
 be on or close to the vertical axis. With this arrangement trunnions
 to the telescope would be very inconvenient, as they would necessi
 tate a long and awkward curved arm,- which would prevent the
 telescope from being turned over from east to west, or from north to
 south.    Accordingly, I have adopted the plan suggested by Mr. W.
 H. Massey, of carrying the telescope by a large disc on its side, rest
 ing and turning in an under-cut groove.          Fig. 1 shows the chief
 details  of  construction finally determined upon, and fig. 2 the finished
 instrument in position. The radio-micrometer must be protected
 from stray radiation and from the effects of hot and cold air currents.
 I therefore arranged that the space at the back of the under-cut disc
 should be made in the form of a box with a movable lid, all of thick
 cast-iron, so that the changes of temperature inside should be
 sufficiently gradual ; then the nature of the radio-micrometer would
 prevent such changes from producing any disturbing effect.             The
 floor of this box continued away from the telescope forms a con
 venient base for holding the lamp (ether oxygen lime light) and
 scale.
     The telescope tube carried by the disc on its side must be balanced
 about the centre of this disc.     The large cast-iron weights carried by
 four rods are in such a position as to balance it exactly ; moreover the

  The vertical column appears too slender.      It was, however, im
portant to get the focus as near the side of the telescope as possible,
and, as the focus should be on or close to the vertical axis, it is clear

that the column must be as slender as possible so long as its stability
is not impaired. The further the focus is outside the telescope, the
larger must be the plane mirror. As this is a disadvantage both on
account of expense and of obstruction of useful rays, I have ma
terially reduced the size of the flat by placing it well on one side of
the axis. The resulting want of definition I found by calculation to
be for my purpose of no importance.        So long as all the rays fall on
the sensitive surface, which in some cases is 1 mm. square, the defini
tion is sufficiently good.    With the very low power eyepiece that
I   use I cannot detect anything more than a point in the image of a
star.
    The radio-micrometer which     I  made for this purpose is unusually
 large and massive, and, as the suspended circuit is hung in a narrow
 hole drilled, in this great mass of solid metal, differences of tempera
 ture in different parts of the circuit can hardly be produced by out
 side influence, as, for instance, the observer's body.       Any heat so
 applied must first unequally warm the massive cast-iron box; it
  must then be imparted to the solid metal radio-micrometer (nearly
 MO lbs.), which is only supported by five points forming a geometrical
 slide, aud then it will only be the difference of temperature in the
 solid metal between points not much more than a quarter of an inch
 apart, which by imparting some portion of itself to the suspended
 circuit will cause any indication of heat or cold.           If, however,
 radiation reaches the sensitive surface through the small hole drilled
 horizontally in the solid metal, and this can only come from the
 limited field of view of the telescope, then one portion of the circuit
 will be independently warmed, and a corresponding deflection will
 be produced.
     The only part of the instrument which reaches       outside the cast-
 iron box is a slender tube which carries the cork and pin from which
 the circuit is suspended by a very fine quartz fibre. This tube is
 made of glass ground into the metal of the radio-micrometer. The
 object of using glass is to prevent any loss of heat from the ap
 paratus into the outer air. This part is also boxed in by an easily
  removable double box of wood. In making this tube I blew a hole
  in the side and thickened it with a welt of glass about half an inch
  above the level of the box lid.     To the face of the welt previously
 ground flat is cemented a piece of a plano-convex spectacle lens,
  which forms an image of its own on the scale and at the same time
  brings the light reflected from the plane mirror behind it to a focus
 on the same scale.       The mirror, which consists of a piece of the
  thinnest microscope cover-glass silvered at the back, produces with
  this arrangement an image so good that tenths of millimetre can be
 easily read. To prevent the delicate circuit from being influenced
  by draughts in the telescope, a tube containing diaphragms is fastened

The diaphragms are of such a size as to limit the view from the
sensitive disc to the eone of rays. A tube of this kind was used by
Langley to protect his bolometer from the influence of draughts.
It  is nothing more than the old toy through which you can drop a
pencil but not blow out a candle.
    The arrangements of lamp and scale are hardly worth describing
in detail.     I will merely say that I used the ether light to avoid the
necessity of having two kinds of compressed gases, which, in the
country, would otherwise be necessary.         The ether light is exceed
ingly convenient for this purpose, but              I
                                                can hardly recommend                             it,
for, though I     used the safety burner supplied by the makers, the first
thing  it  did, owing to my inadvertently turning off the oxygen, was
to explode with a loud report, and the copper box, after striking the
roof of the house, fell close to me, not burst,           true, but blown
                                                                 it   is
into  a  more or less bulbous form.       Moreover, on frosty nights, the
ether box   is   so cold that the gas which comes ont requires no more
oxygen,     so  that  an explosive gas      being led from the reservoir
                                               is
direct to the burner. Under these circumstances any stoppage of the
 oxygen supply would at once cause a violent explosion.       As                     it   is,   it   is
 impossible, on a cold night, to. stop the gas without its exploding

 I    provided, between the ether box and the burner, a pair of extra
 regulating taps, which,, by a touch, will turn off the oxygen and tarn
 down the (so-called) hydrogen, or turn them up again for an observa
 tion. By this means waste of ether and oxygen            avoided, and the

mirror and certain minor adjustments         is not worth while to enter

independent adjustment, so that ultimately the focus is in the vertical
axis of rotation, and at the same time the cone of rays fiom the large
mirror is just not sufficient to cover the surface of the flat.
     Though there is a finder, it would hardly be safe to trust to this to
know when a star had just come on to the sensitive surface, and so I
have arranged a 1-inch total reflecting prism behind the metal block
under the magnet, which can be turned round so as to view the sensi
 tive surface, and any image in the small space round it. from either
side of the box.        There is an oblong hole in each side for this
purpose, through which a low power eyepiece, carried by a bracket on
 the metal block, projects; the space round the eyepiece is covered in
 by a separate shield, to prevent hot or cold air from entering the box.
 The dark radiations from the pupil of the eye are entirely prevented,
 by the three glasses, from reaching the sensitive surface, so that it is
 possible to watch the image of any heavenly body quietly transit
 across the disc or sensitive surface without disturbing the indications
 by the heat of the eye.     I have arranged a temporary small telescope
 with a diagonal eyepiece, immediately above that of the chief tele
 scope.     The small telescope shows that part of the scale to which
 the spot of .light is brought, magnified, so that without moving the
 body or any part of the apparatus it is possible to watch a star come
 on' to the disc, and to see the <effect en the scale, and thus to avoid
  every source of error at once. If in any case a star is observed to
  transit over the disc time after time, and the index is not moved
  through one-quarter of a millimetre (and I find on a perfectly clear
  and quitt night there can be no doubt whether this is so or not, — I
  should even have little doubt of a tenth of a millimetre), then it is
  certain that the heat received was not sufficient to produce such a
  deflection. An equatorial star takes about 20 seconds to cross the
  disc, while practically the whole deflection due to any source of heat
   is produced in 5 seconds, and so, no matter how long the star might
  be kept on there would-be no gain^while, on the other hand, the longer
  that it is necessary to leave the star on before practically the whole
  deflection is produced, the greater is the uncertainty of the zero of
  the instrument. The advantage of the short time constant, if I may
  use this expression, is fully proportional to its smallness, if it is not
  proportional to some higher power of its smallness.
      I determined not to put up the apparatus in the doubtful atmo
  sphere of London, and I am fortunate in having been able to fix it in
  my father's garden at Wing, in Rutland.         The position is certainly
   good, the altitude is about 400 feet, the climate is as dry as in any
   part of England. The subsoil is oolitic limestone, containing a large
   quantity of iron, and very firm (the foundations of many of the old
   walls in the village are from 1 to 2 feet above the present level of the
   ground, and are perfectly secure).    There is not a house or building

within 100 yards, and these are screened off by trees.        The only
objection is the rather long railway journey, which prevents isolated
observations at odd times, and makes special observations of temporary
phenomena very inconvenient.
   The column is bolted down to a mass of about 2 tons of concrete,
bedded upon the rock.        The protecting house is made of wood and
galvanised   iron,  and  rests  by four grooved wheels on rails made of
gas-pipe, so that it can, when its own holding-down bolt is un
screwed, be pushed away so as to leave the telescope clear.           The
door lifts off and rests against two posts in one of the borders near.
The figure will be sufficient to make every part, except minor details,
perfectly clear.    I think it will be best to describe the observations
in the order in  which   they were made.
    I began observations on the 6th September, 1888. The night was
clear, but there was a gentle wind from the S.W., which produced an
uncertainty in the position of the zero of a few millimetres.     To keep
off the wind I pulled the house over the telescope and looked east.
Capella and Regulus gave no indication (11 20 p.m.), certainly not

of heat.

produced, the instant the image of the limb met the disc, a rapid
movement of about 30 mm., which gradually declined to about half
when the terminator was reached, after which the deflection at once
fell to nothing. There was no indication of heat from the dark part
of the moon.     The night being good,     was out till dawn, and tried

if desired) over the disc and taking readings every ten seconds.       The
first five curves in fig. 3 are the results of five consecutive transits

over the central part of the moon.         The sixth curve was taken over
the south end of the moon and the seventh curve over the north end.
 They were all taken when the moon was not far from the meridian.
 These are the first observations which clearly indicated a maximum
of heat within the disc and not on the limb. This is evidently about
 the position at which the Sun is vertical, being approximately at right
 angles to the terminator. To save space and confusion, these curves
 are all drawn superposed but separated in time to a small extent.
    September 19th. Full moon.           The first curve, fig. 4, was taken
 when the heat of the moon was largely absorbed by a piece of clean
 window glass fixed across the mouth of the radio-micrometer.           The
 second curve was taken immediately afterwards (9 5 p.m.) without
 glass.   The heat transmitted by the glass, almost exactly 25 per
 cent., is somewhat different from the proportion, 173 percent., which

Lord Rosse obtained for the full moon, using the 3-foot telescope and
a very superior thermo-junction of his own design.* The remarkable
symmetry of the curve for the full moon at first rather puzzled me,
as   I
     expected that the side that had been baked by the sun for from
7 to 14 days would be hotter than the side that had only been lighted
up for from 0 to 7 days. However, if we consider that soil of any kind
is so bad a conductor that it would acquire its final surface tem
perature in perhaps an' hour or less, that       is,not protected by an

than should be expected.     Lord  Rouse's experimentsf on the heat of
the eclipsed moon fully bear this out.
    September 20th. Observed the moon on the horizon, deep red, limb
ill defined, and cloud bands across, looking like the belts of Jupiter.
A series of readings were taken, but not at exactly ten-second in
tervals. The deflection was greatest about the middle, where it reached
15 mm.      Four minutes later   (7  p.m.) the deflection in the middle
                                      2

wind, but what there was was east. There was much dew, and. by
9 p.m. the air had become filled with mist.       Three observations on the
moon (three days past fall) were taken, but owing to the low altitude the
actual amount of deflection was small. The regularity of the curves,
which were the only ones taken that night, is an indication of tbe
perfect quiet of the night. I examined also Vega, Altair, and a Cygni ;
there was certainly not a deflection of ^ mm. The index often did not
move -Tff mm. for several seconds.       As this was a perfect night and
the dark   side of the  moon   was   the  advancing side,    I  made special
observations to see if any heat could be obtained from the dark part
on which the Sun had just ceased to shine, but not the slightest effect
was observed until the terminator itself met the disc of the radio-
micrometer.
   I had at this time to go to London, and so no more observations
were made until the early morning of October 31st, when             I had re
turned to observe the moon a few days before conjunction. The night
was windy after a wet day.      At 3 30 a.m. the deflection on the limb was
25 mm. where it was greatest.         As usual, it gradually decreased up
to the terminator.      At 6 30 a.M., when the moon was higher and
better placed for a delicate test, I tried to observe the heat due to the
earth-shine, which was then very marked.           Owing to the wind wasI
unable to make a satisfactory negative observation, but it was cer
tainly not 2 mm., and      I  believe not 1 mm.       I  have no record of
the deflection on the bright part.
   December 26th (5 30 p.m.). Venus very bright, but not at her best.
An equal area in the moon would produce an effect easily observable,
whereas a part of the moon large enough to produce the same light
would still more produce a measurable deflection.           There was not a
deflection of £ mm.     I had, however, another circuit    in the instrument
at this time which did not    seem   very sensitive.
   April   19th, 1889 (7 30 p.m.). Made many observations on Venus,
which had passed the position of greatest brilliancy.          Sky clear, but
the night was windy, which kept the index moving over a space of
from 10 to 40 mm. Out of many transits observed, only two were not
interrupted by a violent gust of wind. In each of these cases there was
a deflection of from 2 to 3 mm. in the direction of heat, which may
have been real, but   I do not place any reliance upon it.
   I was not satisfied with the delicacy of the apparatus and so made
a new circuit, and suspended it by a fibre 1/5750 inch in diameter.
With an exposed surface of about 4 square mm., illuminated by a
candle flame at a distance of 60 inches, this gave a deflection of
60 mm.
   As Mercury was unusually well placed in May, I took this circuit to
Wing, hoping to obtain effects from the most promising of planets.
Clonds, however, prevented Mercury from once being seen. Later on

 I  was able to observe Arcturus on the meridian         in a clear sky, but
 I obtained no effect.
   On March 25th, 1890, I tested the delicacy of this circuit with a
4-inch Leslie cube (black face) filled with boiling water at a distance
of 81£ inches.     The deflection due to the exposed area of about
4 square mm. was 50 mm.        A   new circuit, made of better materials,
 gave a deflection of  180 mm. under the same conditions, and as this
seemed a good circuit,     I  used    it last Easter with freshly silvered
 mirrors.
   April 2nd, 1890. A perfect night, except a slight but persistent east
wind. The moon, not yet full, sent the index right off the scale
at once.    It was too windy     to    make   satisfactory observations   on
stars.
   April 3rd. Perfect night. Wind very slight, N.N.E. Very dry.
Telescope tube and ether box covered with frost. Ether box so
cold that no separate oxygen was necessary.            I balanced a paraffin
candle on a hedge at a distance of 93 yards, and found on moving the
telescope on and off with the slow motion screw a very constant
deflection of 55 mm. In this case the candle was so much out of
focus that only about one-sixth of the rays fell on the disc, all the
rest passing by.   I could not alter the focus sufficiently, nor could I
put the candle further away that night, but this was done the follow
ing day. About 1 30 a.m. Arcturus was on the meridian. There was
not a deflection of    \ mm. in any of a number of very satisfactory
observations. Mars, low down in S.E., and Regulus and Saturn pro
duced no effect either.
    On Good Friday, April 4th,     I  prepared a clear view up to a mound
250 yards away,    where  a   mill   once  stood, by cutting off the tops of
the hedges that were in the line. On this mound I placed a stand
carrying a beehive with a hole in the side. A candle placed in the
beehive would send its rays into the distant telescope without any
intermediate obstruction. A light paper shutter inside the beehive
was arranged so that it could be pulled to one side by a long piece of
cotton, and be allowed to fall back again so as to obstruct the radiation.
The exact distance from the candle to the mirror (obtained by chain
                                              I
ing) was 250'7 yards. During the day moved the radio-micrometer
on its geometrical slide until the disc and the image of the beehive
were in the same plane.      The image of the candle-flame, which was
about   \ mm. long, was then focussed upon the disc, and all the rays
which entered the telescope from any part of the flame were received
upon the disc.
   About 8 30 p.m., when it was fairly quiet, there being a slight east
wind, my niece, L. Wintle, kindly stationed herself on the mound out
of sight of the telescope, and at a signal either pulled or let go the
cotton.    The telescope was pointed towards the candle the whole
                                                                             /

time. It was not moved, nor was anything moved, except the shntter
in the beehive.      At each movement of the shatter the image of the
light   started  off  violently, and came to rest in about five seconds,
showing a deflection of 38 mm. This was repeated about twenty
times.    This is an absolutely trustworthy measure of the sensibility
of the whole apparatus, including imperfect reflection by the silver
and every factor, except the absorption by the air. This, as the night
was dry and clear, must have been very small.             It shows if ^ mm.
is taken as the smallest deflection            which can bo observed with
certainty, that a candle-flame at 250' 7 yards produces an effect which
is 152 times as great as the least which can be certainly observed ; or
that, if the candle-flame had been taken s/152 or 12-3 times as far away,
that is, 3084 yards, or 1/71 miles, it would have sent into the telescope
sufficient heat to be observed, and therefore more than Arcturus.
   After these measures were made, the stand, &c., were removed, and
my niece stood with her face exactly in the line of the telescope.
The image of her face must have been entirely within the disc.
When she moved on one side the clear sky was in view instead. The
deflection, observed many times, was 48 ram. This large effect was no
doubt chiefly due to the screening of the sky, but I mention the
experiment to show that the mirrors reflect dark heat satisfactorily.
                                                    I
   Later on in the evening, at about 10 p.m., turned the telescope on
to the moon, now about full.         The index was, of course, driven right
off the scale, but with a 6-inch stop over the mouth, the deflection,
due to the centre of the moon's disc, was 150 mm.             With a 12-inch
stop  the  index  again  went   off the scale.  Now   the area of the mirror,
which is 15-625 inches in diameter, is 192 square inches, the area of
the 6-inch stop is 28'25 square inches, and the area obstructed by the
flat is 4.67 square inches.      The effective area of the mirror is there
fore 187.3 square inches, and of the 6-inoh aperture 23.58 square
inches, and the ratio of these numbers, 7'95, is the number by which
the deflection with the 6-inch stop must be multiplied in order to
obtain the deflection that would be obtained from the whole mirror if
all could still go in proportion.        The centre of the full moon, then,
would give, on this supposition, a deflection of 11925 mm., or about
4800 times as great an effect as could be observed with certainty.
Since the disc is in the particular instance about one-sixth of the
diameter of the image of the moon, it is clear that it covers about
1/36 or receives, in round numbers, 1/30 of the total heat, if it is at
the centre.     It is evident, then, that an amount of heat equal to
Ubout 1/150,000 of that sent by the full moon would prodnce an effect
which could be observed with certainty, and Arcturus does not send
this.
   Dr. Huggins did not obtain any effect from the moon, but, as he
used an object glass which would absorb nearly all the moon's heat,

  1890.]            On the Heat   of the  Moon and Stars.               495
 or, at any rate, a large proportion, and as it had a smaller aperture
 and a greater focal length than the mirror which he lent me, so that
 the image of the moon was larger, and on this account also had a
 smaller heating power, it is not surprising that he did not obtain a
 large effect from the moon ; but that he obtained none is, in the face
 of these measures, strong evidence that the deflections observed, and
 which he attributed to the stars, were spurious.
     Mr. Stone did not observe the moon at all, but he concluded from
 his observations that Arcturus was in heating power equivalent to a
 3-inch cube of boiling water at 400 yards. A direct comparison of
 the candle that I used with a 4- inch cube of boiling water gave as the
 ratio of the heating powers on a radio-micrometer, of which the tem
 perature was 15° C., a figure varying slightly with the state of the
 flame, but generally slightly over one half.          Had the comparison
 been made with the radio-micrometer at 0° C., as it was when the
 observations on Arcturus were made, a slightly lower number would,
 of course, have been obtained.       As the face of a 3-inch cube is
 slightly over one-half the face of a 4-inch cube, the candle and
 the 3-inch cube may be taken for the purpose of comparison               as
 sensibly equal.    Now, the direct and conclusive experiment already
described has shown that Arcturus on the meridian is not equal to a
 candle, and therefore to a 3-inch cube at 3084 yards, so that Arcturus
 must have a heating power nearly sixty times less than that given by
Mr. Stone. I cannot clearly follow the whole of Mr. Stone's reason
ing, more especially that part which relates to the rise of temperature
 due to the star. By the use of thermometers in contact with the face
of his pairs when subject to a much stronger radiation, Mr. Stone
 determined the amount by which the face must be raised in tempera
ture to produce a deflection of one division, and he concluded from
the deflection observed that the face was raised through 1/90° C.
Now, on comparing his arrangement with mine, it is evident that, as
I   have a larger aperture, I have more heat to begin with ; as have  I
no glass for the rays to pass through,           I am free from the large
absorption    of glass for heat ; and, finally,  as  my thermo-electric bars
have a sectional area about one- twentieth of that of the bars used
by Mr. Stone, the heat for a given difference of temperature would
have been conducted away at about one-twentieth of the rate ; or, as
this is the chief cause of the cooling of the hot junction, for a given
rate of radiation my junction would have been heated to nearly
twenty times the amount to which Mr. Stone's would be heated.
Taking all these things into consideration — if Mr. Stone's figures are
correct— my junction should have been warmed through about one-

that the radio-micrometer will respond to a temperature rise of less
than one-millionth of a degree. Even if my figure of one-millionth is-
not absolutely correct— and     I believe that the figure should be still
smaller — the discrepancy is so enormous as to require explanation.
 Knowing how completely every thermopile that I have examined fails
to approach in delicacy the radio-micrometer, I cannot quite under
stand how Mr. Stone was able to observe deflections which correspond
to a rate of radiation which is only a few times as great as the least
that    I can observe.    As an instance of the delicacy of the radio-
micrometer, I may state that, compared with the usual form of ther
mopile, made by Messrs. Elliot Brothers, connected with a low
resistance reflecting galvanometer by the same makers, it is fully
one thousand times as sensitive, besides being far more stable or
insensitive to disturbing causes.
    I  think my observations go to show that the heat of Arcturus has
not as yet been observed (unless the refracting telescope possesses
 some mysterious power which the reflector does not) ; and the same
 conclusion may be drawn with respect to the other stars.       I have by
 no means reached what I believe to be a practical limit to the
delicacy of the radio-micrometer, and it is possible that with a more
 delicate instrument, or with a larger telescope— and Mr. Common
 has promised to allow me to use for the purpose his 5-foot reflector
 — I may yet be able to observe some definite and real effect; but that
 I  should have so far failed is not surprising, in view of the following
 argument. When anything is heated and gives out light an incre
 ment of temperature causes a relatively greater increment of light ; so
 that, light for light, less heat is radiated by the hotter body.   Thus,
 among stars that are equally bright, the coolest will send the most
  heat.    Now, a candle-flame is, in all probability, far cooler than
 any white or yellow star ; and so if a candle-flame is removed until
 it appears of the same brightness as some star— for instance, Arc-
 turns — then it should radiate far more heat.       Now, I do not know
 at what distance a candle would appear as bright as Arcturus,
  but supposing that it is as much as 1'71 miles, then, since at this
 distance   I can only just detect the heat of the candle, it is evident
 that I should not be able to detect the heat of Arcturus.
     With regard to the observations on the moon, they are, I know,
 exceedingly fragmentary and incomplete.        They were not, however,
 undertaken for their own sake, though they may have some value, bat
  in order to test the apparatus and to serve as a standard by which
  other observations might be compared with mine.        For work on the
 moon the apparatus is not exactly the most convenient, though it does
  well. For systematic work I should employ the most delicate circuit
  I  could make with a very small sensitive surface and a quick period,
  and then, to obtain curves of heat which should give the deflections

from moment to moment and not only at ten seconds intervals,                    I
should record the movement of the index photographically.               It would
also be an advantage to have the telescope under cover, owing to
the annoyance caused by wind.            I  did not adopt this plan, as     I did
not wish the apparatus to be influenced by any unnecessary source of
heat.   Now that I have found how insensitive it is to everything in
the nature of radiation, except that which is focussed by the tele
scope upon the disc, I know that this precaution was' unnecessary as
well as inconvenient. The apparatus, as designed, is not suitable for
spectroscopic examination of the moon's heat, and so I have not
attempted to repeat any of Langley's observations.             I  may state that,
though neither the properties of the circuit employed nor the ten
seconds readings were suitable for detecting local variations of the
moon's heat, due to bright or dark spots, yet             I did expect to find
indications of local differences.      None, however, were apparent, but        I
can hardly imagine that with a much smaller disc, a more rapid period,
and a photographic record local variations could not be deter
mined.
   As my observations on the moon's heat are so small in number and
were made at such irregular intervals,             I  have not applied Lord
 Rosse's correction* for its absorption by the air.
   The curves of the moon's heat require a slight correction for the
                                 I
lag of the apparatus, which have not attempted to make and which
it would be useless to make unless the curves were drawn by a more
perfect method.     The correction could be reduced to a great extent
 by causing the  telescope or a siderostat to so move as not quite to
keep pace with the earth's rotation, so that a greater time would be
occupied by a transit ; but it would be unsafe to prolong this time to
a great extent, for, besides the greater uncertainty in the position of
the zero, a slight change would be produced by the varying altitude
of the part of the sky under observation, and this would change the
atmospheric absorption. As the telescope is moved from the horizon
to the zenith the index moves over the scale to an extent which is
very variable, but in the direction of cold.
   I  should have stated that very thin clear mica absorbs a large
proportion of the moon's heat. On the night that             I  tried this I was
unable to measure the proportion, as while with the mica obtained a  I
deflection (not recorded in my notes) of roughly 200 mm., without
                                                    I

radiation.
   Anticipating trouble owing to the varying state of the sky, such as
                             I
was found by Mr. Stone, devised a form of radio-micrometer circuit
 which should be differential. Thus, calling the alloys used A and B,

two  A   bars are soldered to the lower ends of the copper wire arch,
two B   bars are soldered to these and joined below.        The A, B junc
tions are then exposed in the radio-micrometer side by side, and so
are unaffected by general atmospheric influences, while as a star
passes from one to the other the effect of the star will be reversed.
On a quiet night the single junction works so well that I have not at
present tried the differential form.
   It is my intention to make observations from time to time when          I
am able, but these, owing to my duties in London, can only be made
at uncertain intervals.

           — At the time that this paper was sent in did not realise
that the larger figure that       I   obtained for the percentage trans
mission of the moon's heat through glass, viz., 25, instead of about
17, as found by Lord Bosse, far from being of the nature of a dis
crepancy, is in reality a difference which should be expected.         Lord
Rosse made observations on the total heat only ; he did not localise
parts of the moon, as       I  have done.    He found a greater propor
tionate   transmission   at the  full  moon  than  at the quarters, viz., 17
at the full and 8 at the quarters.          Now, taking elements in the
moon,    I  cannot think that this proportion can to any appreciable
extent depend on the altitude of the earth at the element, but it
should depend on the altitude of the sun there, for upon this the heat
received by the element depends.          Now, in taking the full moon as
a whole, there are elements with the sun at all altitudes from 0° to
90° ; but those parts with the sun at the zenith are most favourably
situated to produce their effect on the earth, and thus the observed
effect, which is the result of all the parts, should show a percentage
transmission between that due to a zenith sun and a sun near the
horizon, which should also be the case with the moon at the quar
ters or between the quarters and the full ; but there is this difference,
as the moon approaches the quarters the effect of the parts on which
the sun is shining vertically becomes proportionately less and less, and
so while with a full moon            the percentage transmission should
approach that due to an element with a vertical sun, with a half
moon the percentage should be more nearly that due to an element
with a rising or setting sun.
    Now my method of observation of the moon at once gives the
means of finding the percentage transmission due to an element
with the sun at any altitude. The curve, fig. 4, shows that the centre
 of the full moon does send a larger proportion through glass than
 either limb, and, as it should do, a greater proportion than the inte
gral result found by Lord Bosse. A single transit of the full moon
 should, therefore, give data from which the integral result of the
 moon in any phase could be calculated, and corresponding observa

tions upon the moon in other phases would show experimentally
whether the percentage transmission by glass of the heat from an
element of the moon does depend on the altitude of the sun only, or
whether the altitude of the earth also has any influence, as, indeed, is
suggested by Lord Rosso in a note to his Bakerian Lecture (' Phil.
Trans.,' vol. 163, p. 626).        It is unfortunate that I have not at pre
sent made any other observations on the transmission by glass of the
moon's heat.— April 21, 1890.]
IV. " Observations            on   the    Secretion of Bile in a case of
        Biliary Fistula." By A. W. Mayo Kobson, F.R.C.S., Hon.
        Surgeon, Leeds General Infirmary, Lecturer on Practical
        Surgery at the Yorkshire College, and Examiner in the
        Victoria University.            Communicated by Dr. Clifford
        Allbutt, F.R.S. Received April 3, 1890.'
    There are few physiological questions on which so much doubt and
disagreement prevail as on that of the secretion and uses of bile,
this being especially marked when we come to compare the appa
rently contradictory observations of various experimenters relating
to the action of drags on the biliary secretion.
    As the well known experiments of Dr. Rutherford and Messrs.
Prevost and Binet were conducted on the lower animals, it may
possibly acconnt for the differences between their observations and
those recorded in this paper.             From the rarity of cases of biliary
 fistula in healthy human subjects, the opportunity has rarely occurred
for a careful analysis of fresh bile in sufficient quantity, or for a
 complete analysis of the whole twenty-four hours' secretion ; and in
 all previous analyses no notice has been taken of the gall-bladder
 secretion.
     In  the   following cases, the fistulae remained open for long
periods     after   the initial operations, the total flow of bile or gall
 bladder secretion was carefully collected and accurately measured at
 different times and for many consecutive hours at a time, and the
general good health of the patients was maintained throughout.
                                Method of Collecting.
    The fluid was caught in a light glass flask, into the mouth of
which it was guided by means of a celluloid cannula, a substance
chosen after several trials with metal ones, on account of its lightness
and non -irritating qualities.
    • This paper is a revision of that read on January 16, under the title " Observa
tions regarding the Secretion and Uses of Bile " (see p. 129, supra).

500               Mr. A. W. Mayo Robson.           On the       [Apr. 24,
                         Case  I. — Biliary Fistula.
   Mrs. V. B., aged forty-two, was operated on in January, 1888, for
the relief of obstruction in the common bile duct. The incision was
made    over the gall-bladder, which was brought to the surface,
relieved of its contents, and opened, the margin being sutured to the
edge of the abdominal wound and drained.          The patient made a good
recovery from the operation ; but a biliary fistula persisted, through
which was discharged the whole of the bile for fifteen months. In
order to ascertain that the whole of the bile secreted escaped through
the fistula, and that none entered the bowel, repeated analyses of the
urine and faeces were made, but no evidence of the presence of bile
was obtained at any time.         The fistula was ultimately closed by
stitching the gall-bladder to the bowel, and making a communica
tion between them, thus enabling the bile to reach the intestine by
another channel.      A detailed description of the case will be found
in the Transactions of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society '
        '
for 1889.
    Influence of Biliary Fistula on Digestion and Nutrition.
                                                                — During
the fifteen months that the fistula was open, the patient's diges
tion seemed to be unimpaired. The appetite generally was good;
there was a craving for acids, such as lemons and pickles, and
a dislike to sweet foods, to meat, and to fat.       Much fatty matter in
her food had a marked effect, producing a sickly feeling, with loss of
appetite, and rather more fat than normal was then noticed in the
faeces.   Her bowels were quite regular without the use of aperients,
and the odour of the faeces did not differ from that of healthy motion.
Menstruation never occurred during the time the fistula was patent,
but, as soon as the bile was again turned into the intestine, the
menstrual function became regular and normal.
              Case  II. —Fistula  of Gall-bladder not Biliary.
   Mrs. A., aged thirty-two, was operated on in June, 1884, for dis
tended gall-bladder due to gall-stones, with stricture of the cystic
duct ; the patient made a good recovery from the operation, but a
fistula of the gall-bladder persisted.      From this opening a constant
flow of a clear and somewhat viscid fluid persisted, which was held
to be the normal secretion of the gall-bladder, as there was complete
obstruction of the cystic duct, and as no bile constituents were found
in the fluid at the time of the operation or subsequently.
   Analyses of the fluid from this patient were made in October, 1885,
and in April, 1887, by Professor de Burgh Birch, of the- Yorkshire
               '
 College (see Journal of Physiology,' vol. 8, No. 6), and in March,
1889, by Mr. Fairley, F.C.S., F.R.S.E.        In the appended tables will

be found     Mr. Fairley's analysis of the secretion      for twenty-four
hours.
   The alleged Diastatic Action of bile may possibly  be due  to the admix
ture of the secretion from the gall-bladder, or from the mucous glands
in the large bile ducts. In the gall-bladder fluid from Case II, Pro
fessor Birch found a diastatic ferment, concerning which he reported : —
" The secretion cannot     be regarded as having any important part to
play in digestion, the small diastatic action it possesses on starch
being shared by many fluids in the economy upon which it does
not confer any special digestive value."       (' Journal of Physiology,'
vol. 8, No. 6.)
   Antiseptic Action. — In Case I, the value of bile as an antiseptic in the
intestine could be tested only by the character of the faeces, which, over
a period of fifteen months during which no bile entered the bowel, did
not by odour or aspect indicate any irregular fermentative process. In
Case II, the constant clean appearance of the edge of the fistula sug
gested to me the idea that it might be due to the antiseptic quality
of the gall-bladder fluid ; and the observation, that when collecting
the fluid for experimental purposes     I could leave the flasks exposed
to the air for several days without any apparent change, suggested
the same conclusion. Professor Birch, from numerous cultivation
experiments, came to the conclusion that its antiseptic properties
 were slight, the want of change being rather due to the poverty of
 the fluid in nourishing materials. (' Journal of Physiology,' vol. 8.)
    Aperient Action. — In Case I, the bile did not seem to be at all
necessary as an intestinal stimulant, for the bowels were quite regular
during the whole of the time that no bile was entering the intestines.
    Alleged Action of Bile in Promoting Absorption. — In Case I,
fat could apparently be digested in quantities sufficient not
only to maintain normal nutrition and good health, but to lead
to an increase in weight.        If taken too freely it seemed to create
 disturbances of digestion, and to be passed in rather larger quantities
 than usual in the faeces, as ascertained by careful observation and by
 separation by means of ether.
    Diet. — Details of the daily diet are given in the tables, and may be
 grouped as follows :—
       I. Oct. 24th— 27th. Light diet. Broth, bread, egg, tea, milk,
            pudding.
      II. Oct. 29th— Nov. 4th. Chicken diet.             Ditto          with
            chicken.
    III.  Nov. 5th— 8th. Potato diet.                     Ditto         with
            potato.
    IV.   Nov. 12th. Meat diet.    Meat, bread, milk, tea.

502               Mr. A. W. Mayo Robson.           On  the        [Apr. 24,
                               Flow of Bile.
   The Tables appended show the dates and hours of collection lasting
over a period of eight months ; the nature and quantity of the diet ;
and the amount of bile excreted.       The Charts also show the dates of
administering   certain medicines,   and  their effect or absence of effect
ou the biliary secretion.
   In the drawing up of the charts and tables           I have been greatly
assisted by my friend Mr. C. W. Biden.
   Daily Quantity of Bile Flow. — In Case I, the quantity of bile col
lected in twenty-four hours on various dates in October, November,
and December of 1888, and January, February, March, and April
of 1889, varied from 3953 oz. to 2586 oz., and averaged 2998 or
nearly 30 oz. In Case     II the gall-bladder fluid measured 2 53 oz. in
twenty-four   hours.
   Subtracting this amount from the twenty-four hours' discharge in
Case I, we get the average daily flow of bile as 27-^ oz.
   Diurnal Variation in Flow. — The Tables and Charts show distinctly
that more bile is invariably excreted during the day than at night ;
the difference at times being as much as 5 oz., at others not more
than 3 dr.
   In the tables and charts which show an hourly collection for over
twenty-four hours, it is clearly seen that the excretion of bile is con-
tinuons night and day.        These measurements were carefully and
regularly made by the sisters in charge of the ward, under the super
vision of the resident surgical officer, Mr. H. Littlewood, F.R.C.S.,
and my house surgeons, Mr. B. Moynihan, M.B., F.R.C.S., and Mr.
                                   I
F. Hudson, M.R.C.S., to whom am much indebted for the great
pains they took over so long a period.
   The daily quantity does not correspond with the observations of
von Wittich and Westphalen, who reported a collection of one pint
in the twenty-four hours, with but small variations during ten days.
   More solids are contained in the bile by night than by day, as is
shown by the analysis of the specimens which were examined by
Mr. Fairley (see appended Tables).
   The quantity of bile discharged is apparently not much influenced
by the ingestion of food.     The reception of food into the stomach is
generally contemporaneous with a marked decline in the flow of bile,
lasting for about two hours.     The colour of the fresh bile was always
green.    The violet odour of turpentine was perceived in the bile soon
after its administration.
                   The Effect of Drugs on the   Bile Flow.
   The observations made on the effect or non-effect of certain
drugs on the biliary secretion show results which are at variance

    Calomel. — On Nov. 7th, 1888, 5 gr. of calomel were administered
at  7 p.m. ; a slight aperient effect followed the next morning, but, on
comparing the amount of bile excreted before and after, it was found
that for ten hours before the administration of the calomel,

12 oz. 6   dr. 20 min. of bile were excreted, and that for ten hours sub
sequent to the administration 10 oz. 4 dr. 30 min. were excreted, i.e.,
2 oz. 1 dr. 50 min. less.
   Euonymin. — On Nov. 17th 4 gr. of euonymin were given at
ll-30 a.m. ; for the four hours preceding the administration,
5 oz. 4 dr. 9 min., and during the four hours subsequent             to its
administration, 5 oz. 1 dr. 8 min., were excreted, i.e., 3 dr. less-
This dose was repeated on several occasions with similar results.
   Rhubarb. — On Nov. 13th, at 11 a.m., £ oz. of tincture of
rhubarb was administered ; during             the preceding six hours
7 oz. 3 dr. 23 min. of bile were excreted, and during the six hours
subsequent to the administration of the drug, 7 oz. 4 dr. 19 min.
were excreted, that is 56 mins. more, in the subsequent than in the
preceding six hours. But on comparing the corresponding period of
the previous day, when no rhubarb was given, we find that
8 oz. 6 dr. 10 min., or 1£ oz. more, were excreted.          Therefore no
increased flow of bile can be put down to the action of the rhubarb.
   On Nov. 15th, I oz. of tincture of rhubarb was given.        The figures
as seen in the tables again show a diminution compared with the
previous day.
   Podophyllin was given on one occasion, and no cholagogue effect
was noticed.
    Carbonate of Soda. — Soda water, aerated, was given, and produced
an increased flow. Its ingestion was followed in two hours by a
maintained increased flow not succeeded by a marked diminution.
    Jridin. — On April 16th, 4 gr. of iridin was followed by a good
 afternoon rise in the bile flow, but two days later there was a much
 higher afternoon rise when no drug had been given. On April 19th,

506                Mr. A. W. Mayo Robson.        On  the       [Apr.  24,
4 gr. of   iridin gave an effect not  so  pronounced, the increased flow
being intermittent.     Apparently, the action of iridin is to increase
the flow temporarily, without augmenting the total quantity in
twenty-four hours.
   Turpentine. — Messrs. Prevost and Binet state that turpentine and
its derivatives promote a notable increase in the excretion. In order
to test this, a turpentine capsule containing 15 min. of the oil of
turpentine was given every four hours night and day.
   On Jan. 18th, no drug given. 27 oz. 6 dr. 35 min. were excreted
in twenty-four hours. On Jan. 19th and 20th, during the adminis
tration of turpentine capsules, 28 oz. 5 dr. 41 min. were excreted,
that is, an increase of 7 dr. During the following twenty-four hours,
the capsules being continued, 30 oz. 2 dr. 10 min. were excreted.
   During the third period of twenty-four hours with the capsules
26 oz. 57 min. were excreted ; and during the fourth twenty-four
hours 27 oz. 45 min.
   Therefore, although an increase was apparent on the second day,
the daily amount of bile discharged in the twenty-four hours was not
so much as on many days when no turpentine was being given, as,
for instance, on Oct. 27th and 29th, when it was over 30 oz.
   Benzoate of Soda. — Messrs. Prevost and Binet state that the
administration of benzoate of soda to dogs increased the amount of
bile to two or three times the normal. This     I  do not find to be the
result in Case I, as the table and charts appended will show, where
no positive increase is seen.
                                Conclusions.
   First. — The bile is probably chiefly excrementitious, and, like the
urine, is constantly being formed and cast out.
   Secondly. — Though the bile probably assists in the absorption of
fats, its presence in the intestine is not necessary for the digestion of
such an amount of fat as is capable of supporting life and keeping
up nutrition.
   Thirdly. — Increase in body weight and good health are quite com
patible with the entire absence of bile from the intestines.
   Fourthly. — The antiseptic properties of the bile are unimportant.
   Fifthly. — Whatever little antiseptic quality bile may have is pro
bably derived from its admixture with the gall-bladder fluid.
   Sixthly. — The supposed stimulating effect of the bile on the intes
tinal walls is not necessary for a regular action of the bowels.
   Seventhly. — The quantity of bile excreted in the twenty-four hours,
during health in a person of average weight, may vary between
39 oz. 4 dr. and 25 oz. 6 dr., with an average of 30 oz., less the
2J oz. of fluid secreted by the gall-bladder.

 1890.]         Secretion      of Bile in   a Case   of Biliary Fistula.              507
    Eighthly. — More bile is excreted during the day than at night, the
 excess varying between 5 oz. and 3 dr.
    Ninthly. — The excretion of bile seems to go on constantly and with
 great regularity.
    Tenthly. — The excretion is apparently not materially influenced by
 diet.
    Eleventhly. — The pigment of fresh haman bile is biliverdin.
    Twelfthly. — The supposed cholagognes investigated seem to
 rather diminish than increase the amount of bile excreted.

                                    I. Introduction.
    The phenomena of the electric discharge in gases excite a wide
spread interest at the present time.                 It could hardly be otherwise ;
 for although our knowledge of electric manifestations is increasing
in all directions, we cannot be assured of the correctness of our ex
planations while the mysterious appearance of the gas discharge
remains unexplained.            As long as we still have to account for a
series    of  most puzzling facts, it seems possible that we are on the
wrong road altogether, and that there may be some surprise in store
for us which will ultimately compel us to reconsider all our present
ideas.     I have endeavoured during the last ten years to study the
 gas discharge, with a view to finding some explanation which should
bo in agreement with the conclusions drawn from other parts of
physics.
    In the year 1884 I presented to the Royal Society* an outline of a
                       •  'Roy. Soc. Proo.,' vol. 37, p. 317 (1884).

                The Discharge    of Electricity through       Gases.       527
theory which seemed to me to form a hopeful starting point for future
investigation.      I have every reason to be satisfied with the way in
which that theory has been received by other workers in the same
field, and I think that, in spite of difficulties, which I do not wish to
underrate, it is generally considered to have a good chance of ultimate
success.    I  have since been able to extend my views, and am bold
enough to think that we may now form a fairly complete idea of the
most important features of the gas discharge.
   In 1882, that is, two years before my paper was presented to the
Royal Society, Mr. Giese* was led, by a study of the electric con
ductivity of the gases which rise from flames, to the identical
hypothesis which formed the basis of my paper.              I much regret that
I  have only recently become acquainted with Mr. Giese's work, as
I should have been glad to have drawn attention to it.
   We both assume that each molecule of a gas contains atoms which
carry equal and opposite charges ; and that these charges are the
same as those carried by the ions in electrolytes ; that, further, a
current of electricity through a gas can only be maintained by a
diffusion of the charged atoms through it.              I  have never claimed
much originality for this hypothesis, as the same idea must have
occurred to many others, and it would probably be difficult to trace
its early history. The hypothesis of definite charges only forms a
small part, however, of the theory which I have sketched out in my
previous paper.       By itself alone it is not sufficient to account for the
observed facts.        In order to distinguish the theory from others,
I  shall call it the theory of " electrolytic convection," as it resembles
in many ways the kind of conduction in liquids which has been
described under that name by Helmholtz.             The theory of electrolytic
convection offers obvious explanations of a number of different
phenomena, as has been shown by Giese for the discharge through
gases rising from flames, by myself for the discharge introduced
by strong electromotive forces, and by Elster and Geitel for a number
of other phenomena.         According to this theory, a gas insulates as
long as there are ho free ions present, but acts as a conductor as soon
as, through some cause or other, the molecules are split up into ions.
We meet with formidable difficulties, however, when we come to
discuss the transference of electricity between the solid conductor
and the gas ; for here we are to a great extent tied down by our
knowledge of electrolysis in liquids. We know that a difference of
potential of 2 volts between the electrodes is sufficient to decompose
water, and therefore to allow the interchange of electricity between
the metal and the ion of hydrogen or oxygen.                  No theory of gas
discharges is admissible which cannot be brought into harmony with
these facts.

                       Definition of Unipolar Conductivity.
   An electrode     often    discharges electricity of one kind more freely
than that of the opposite kind. The phenomenon has been called that
of nnipolar conductivity, but we evidently require some understand
ing as to when we shall call a gas or an electrode positively unipolar.
If a positive charge on an electrode becomes more quickly dissipated
than a negative charge, we may either say that the electrode
discharges positive electricity more rapidly into the gas, or that the
gas discharges negative electricity more rapidly into the electrode.
Some confusion may be caused by the fact that different writers have
looked at the question from different sides and have not adopted
a uniform nomenclature.           I shall call an electrode positively unipolar
if it discharges positive electricity more freely into the gas than
negative electricity.*        A great part of the following paper will deal
with the circumstances under which the exchange of an ion between
the conductor and the molecules or atoms takes place, and it will be
shown how the peculiar behaviour of gases may be explained. This
I consider an important step in support of the theory.
                                                        "
   Such expressions as " surface resistance                or " counter electro
motive force " have often been employed in cases where they seem to
me to be quite unsuitable, and         I shall therefore avoid them altogether ;
but I may occasionally briefly speak of an impediment to the passage
of electricity at an electrode, meaning that a rapid fall of potential at
that electrode is required to introduce or maintain the discharge.
             Circumstances    under which the Discharge takes place.
   It will    be convenient to divide         the subject into two main parts :
the one dealing with the circumstances under which a discharge can
take place, and the other with the phenomena of the discharge itself.
It   is well known that, if one of two conductors, separated by a gas,
is electrified while the other is connected to earth, the gas acts as a
perfect insulator as long as the difference of potential between them
does not exceed a certain value ; if it does, the dielectric strength of
the medium breaks down.
    It is a matter of some doubt whether, if a spark passes between two
conductors of different form, as for instance between a sphere and a
plane or between a point and a sphere, the striking distance is
different in the two directions. There probably is some difference of
this nature in favour of a more easy escape of positive electricity,
   * Elster and Geitcl in  a recent publication have adopted a different nomencla
ture.    They say that a glowing platinum wire in oxygen discharges negative
electricity more easily than positive, meaning that the electrode allows a free pas
sage to negative electricity from the gas to the electrode (' Wiedemann, Annalen,'
vol. 38 (1889), p. 39).

               The Discharge         of Electricity through        Gases.          529
 though the want of symmetry is not very marked. The important
 measurements of Wiedemann and Ruhlmann* are generally taken to
prove a more easy escape of negative electricity under reduced
pressure ; but when a number of sparks are taken in rapid succession,
as they were in these experiments, recent researches seem to indicate
that the gas and electrodes may not return to their original condition
 between the discharges.             The consequence is that such a rapid
succession of sparks shows some of the phenomena of the continuous
current, and the want of symmetry is therefore of the same nature
as that which belongs to the discharge, and has nothing to do with
the circumstances which determine whether a discharge shall pass or
not. The same remarks apply to Lichtenberg figures and Priestley's
rings ; they are complicated cases of phenomena which are best
studied by means of the continuous current.                    I  pass on to consider
 the cases where a current may pass between two electrodes, the
difference of potential being small.
    We have four different ways of converting the gas into a con
ductor, and our subject must be subdivided accordingly.                    If the elec
trodes are either (1) heated to redness or (2) illuminated by ultra
 violet light, the discharge passes even when the difference of potential
•does not amount to more than a few volts.                  Further (3), it has long
been known that flames do not behave as dielectrics ; and, finally (4),
gases through which a discharge is passing have been shown to
conduct freely.
                    (1.) Discharge from Glowing Electrodes.
    Edward Becquerel,t        as far as   I   know, was the first to discover that
air  between    red-hot platinum electrodes ceases to insulate, and he
points out that when the two electrodes are of different sizes, the
equalisation of potential takes place more quickly if the larger
electrode is negative.          Guthrie,    J   by a different method of experi
mentation, found that red- or white-hot iron balls discharged elec
tricity more easily when positive than when negative.
    Looking at the question from the point of view of the theory of
electrolytic convection, it seems of the greatest importance to decide
whether the discharge from hot bodies is accompanied by any
chemical action or not. Mr. Arthur Stanton has conducted in my
laboratory a research intended to throw light on the question. The
•experiments were planned and independently carried out by him, and
his own account of them appears (p. 559) as an Appendix to this
                I
paper. But must briefly allude to his results, which                     I consider to
be  of great importance.

      Behaviour of Copper Electrodes. — Let ns first consider the case of
  conductors charged negatively.           Clean copper, heated to a full
  redness in air, is found to discharge negative electricity freely, but, if
  oxidised carefully all over the surface, it will retain its charge.     If on
  the other     hand  oxidised   copper   is heated  in  hydrogen   instead  of
  in air, it will be quickly discharged until all the oxide is reduced ;
  after that, the charge will be retained.         In other words, negative
  electricity is quickly discharged during the process of oxidation or
   deoxidation, but not otherwise, as when clean copper is heated in
  hydrogen or oxidised copper in air. So far as the experiments could
  be carried out, with iron in place of copper they gave similar results.
  As regards the behaviour of copper when it is positively electrified, the
  phenomena are not so sharply defined.          Positive copper in au atmo
  sphere    of hydrogen   seems   certainly   to discharge itself, even when
  perfectly reduced, so that it retains a negative charge.       Copper in air
  seems to discharge positive electricity less freely when it is oxidised
  than during the process of oxidation, but whether it ultimately
  retains its charge in all cases or not has not yet been completely de
  termined. Preliminary experiments in nitrogen have given the same
  results as those observed in hydrogen, leakage taking place when
  red-hot copper is electrified positively, but not when it is electrified
  negatively.
      These experiments tend to show that the process of oxidation or
  deoxidation can powerfully affect the facility of discharge from red-
  hot iron or copper; so much so that no very extraordinary precau
   tions are necessary to destroy all signs of leakage of a negative charge.
  We are not justified as yet in asserting that the discharge of negative
   electricity is always accompanied by a chemical action even with the
   metals experimented upon, for the temperature at which the experi
   ments were carried on was limited by the danger of melting the
   copper, and the leakage was only tested by the more or less rapid
   collapse of two gold leaves connected with the charged body. A
   higher temperature might have brought out the leakage again, or
  even at a red heat more delicate methods might have shown that the
   leakage was only greatly reduced, but not destroyed.            As regards
   positively charged bodies,       it is still an open question whether
   chemical action plays any part in regulating the rate of discharge.
   The gold leaves collapsed quickly when copper was heated in hydro
   gen, but there may have been some action between the two bodies,
   and Mr. Stanton noticed the fact that the copper became very brittle.
    It is possible that with pure gases not acting chemically on the
    electrodes no discharge at all takes place, but this is by no means
    proved, and on the whole   I  think the evidence is against the supposi
   tion. We must for the present be satisfied with the fact that we can
    actually trace the effect of chemical action in destroying the leakage
%
   of negative electricity.

              The Discharge        of Electricity through        Gases.           531
   Behaviour of Platinum Electrodes. — We owe to Messrs. Elster and
 Geitel* a series of most instructive experiments, in which they have
 discussed the unilateral conductivity of gases in several cases.              Their
 research was chiefly directed to an investigation of some observed
 electromotive forces between glowing bodies and the surrounding gas.
 These electromotive forces, as well as those discovered by Righi,
which appear under the action of ultra-violet light, will,                 I believe,
prove to be of the greatest importance in clearing up many electrical
questions, for they Seem to me to belong to a class of phenomena
which can be brought under the domain of the second law of thermo
dynamics.     I am, however, for several reasons, anxious to avoid, for
the present, a discussion regarding them, except in so far as they
seem to have a bearing on the question of a possible chemical action
at the electrodes.     The facts discovered by Elster and Geitel are
briefly as follows : —
   If a white-hot platinum wire and a cold metal are brought near
each other in an enclosure filled with gas at various pressures, a-
difference of potential is observed between the two metals ; when the
gas is air or carbonic acid, the hot platinum is electro-negative to the
cold wire, while in hydrogen or hydrocarbons the opposite is the case.
It is also found that platinum in air discharges positive electricity
more readily than negative, while again the opposite is the case in
hydrogen.
    Messrs. Elster and Geitel bring these facts into connexion with
each other. The curious relationship between unilateral conductivity
and electromotive force, which they have traced, is an important one,
but may only be one of those reciprocal relations (Peltier effect and
thermo-electric force) so often met with in all parts of physics.
As regards the explanation of these phenomena, several considerations
occur to me which' should make us careful not to pronounce a definite
opinion at present.      The authors take it for granted that the electro
motive force has its seat at the hot junction of metal and air. That is
probable, but it will be safer for the present not to commit ourselves
to more than is actually observed, namely, that if a cold platinum,
wire in air is placed near a hot platinum wire, the hot wire will be
electro-negative towards the cold metal, while in hydrogen it will be
electro-positive.    At first sight the behaviour of platinum wire seems
exactly the reverse to that of copper; but platinum shows some
curious effects on long continued heating, which lead me to the
opinion that complicated effects here determine the nature of the
phenomenon. Elster and Geitel have examined the changes in the
behaviour of a platinum wire kept glowing in hydrogen.                           Two
platinum    wires were    kept    in  the  same    enclosure   ;  one   of them   was

Academy ' Sitzungsberiehte,' vol.  97 (Abth. 2. a.), p. 1175 (1888).

,532                          Mr. A. Schuster.
 heated only during as short a time as possible, while the other was
kept glowing for several hours. The former, while hot, became electro
negative towards the gas in contact, while the latter became electro
positive. It seems probable that the difference is due to gases dissolved
in the platinum and given up by long-continued heating, and we are
 led to the opinion that in the normal state of platinum, when it is
freed from its dissolved gases, it becomes electro-negative on heating.
 The authors do not state whether the unilateral property of hot
platinum altered together with the sign of its electrification, though
their own experiments would lead one to think that this was the case.
   It is unnecessary to enter into the question how the dissolved gases
can affect the result. We observe very similar phenomena with
platinum electrodes in liquids.           The great differences observed,
owing to comparatively small changes in the state of the platinum,
incline me to a chemical, rather than to a physical, explanation. An
important experiment bearing on the question is worth quoting.
Berliner* showed that the disintegration of platinum electrodes, so
commonly observed in vacuum tubes, altogether ceases when the metal
has been deprived       of its dissolved gases. While disintegration is
taking place     the   surface is constantly renewed, and any surface
action between the platinum and the surrounding gases could be
kept up continuously, but would stop as soon as the disintegration
itself has stopped.
   Similar effects to those described by Elster and Geitel had been
previously observed by Goldstein and Warburg.                   After Hittorff
had discovered that the fall of potential at the negative electrode,
which is necessary to produce a continuous discharge, disappears if a
glowing platinum wire is taken as kathode, Goldstein found that the
platinum wire permanently loses the power of acting if it is kept red-
hot for a sufficient time.       WarburgJ states that, on hardening the
wire by drawing it may be brought back to its original condition, so
that on heating it will again discharge negative electricity freely.
      I
But learn from private information which Professor Warburg has
been kind enough to supply me that the surface of his wire might
have become coated with greasy matter in the act of hardening, and,
if that is so, we are at liberty to connect the free discharge of negative
electricity with a chemical action at the electrode.
   Behaviour of Carbon Electrodes. — It is clear that the behaviour of
carbon electrodes cannot give us any certain information on the
question as to how far unipolar effects depend on chemical action ;
but, as some phenomena shown by glow lamps have received the
attention of electricians, it may be useful to point out that, as far as

  I   can see,    they present no special features which are not easily
 explained by well-known facts of vacuum discharges.                      Owing to the
 incandescence of the filaments, the different potential at the ends is
 sufficient to produce a discharge through the residual gas ; hence the
 observed disintegration of the negative end of the filament.                         If a
 separate metallic plate is inserted into the lamp, its potential will be
 intermediate between that of the positive and that of the negative
 pole.      On being connected with the positive pole a current will tend
 to pass in such a direction as will make the plate an anode. The
 current actually will pass, because we know that a conductor offers
 no difficulty to the discharge of positive electricity into a gas in which
the discharge is established.               This phenomenon has been called the
 " Edison effect."          If the plate is connected with the negative elec
trode, it will tend to become a kathode.                       The fall of potential
required is now much greater, and hence the current is much weaker,
and may escape detection.*
     According to the theory of electrolytic convection, we conclude
that when an electrode is raised to a red or white heat the molecules
partially dissociate and render conduction possible.                       It does not
necessarily follow        that   the temperature       alone is sufficient to dissociate
the molecules ; it may be that the addition of an electric stress is
necessary.         It will be a matter for future investigation to decide
whether the decomposition goes on at the same rate in contact with
a negative wire as it does in contact with a positive wire.
     2. Behaviour of Electrodes illuminated by Ultra-violet Light. — Hertz,f
during his celebrated experiments on electric oscillations, noticed that
a spark passed more easily between metallic points when these were
illuminated by a simultaneous strong spark from another source, and
traced the effect to the illumination of the secondary electrodes by
the ultra-violet rays sent out by the primary spark.                        Messrs. E.
Wiedemann and EbertJ found that the negative electrode only is
active in this oase, and Hallwachs§ subsequently attacked the question
by a method which has yielded very interesting results.
     He connected a gold leaf electroscope with a clean plate of zinc,
upon which a beam of strong ultra-violet light was allowed to fall.
The zinc was found to be incapable of retaining a negative charge ;
the effect on a positive charge was so small that at first sight it
seemed totally absent.             But the fact to which I wish to draw special
attention is the importance, in order to ensure the success of the
experiment, of taking a clean surface of zinc. Hallwachs found that
    •        the facts described by Mr. Fleming in his recent communication
       [All                                                                      (' tupra,

zinc exposed to the air for some time showed the negative leakage to
a much smaller extent, but the positive leakage was not affected, so
that old surfaces sometimes discharged a positive chargo more easily
than a negative one. Other metals behave like zinc, but the less
oxidisable ones show the effect to a much smaller extent.
    Hallwachs draws the conclusion, to which indeed his experiments
seem inevitably to lead, that the ultra-violet light produces a chemical
change at the surface, which is of the same nature as the one going
on when surfaces are left lying exposed to the air. The explana
tion which at first sight seems the most natural one, namely, that the
chemical change is an oxidation, would appear from an experiment
more recently communicated by him* not to be the true one, for
copper covered with a film of oxide behaves like clean metallic
copper.
    Shortly after the publication of those experiments,           Righif showed
that a photo-electric air-cell can be constructed by taking two
parallel plates of different metals with an air space between them and
connecting them with each other.             If one of the plates is of zinc, the
other of brass, and if the zinc plate is illuminated, a current tends to
flow from the zinc to the brass through the air.
   In the actual experiments, the brass plate was in the form of a
wire netting, so that the rays from an arc lamp could pass through
the grating and fall normally on the zinc plate, and the difference
of potential was observed by means of an electrometer.               The energy
of ultra-violet light vibrations must therefore directly or indirectly
be converted into that of electric separation, and it is to my mind
natural to assume that a chemical action is set up in the first place
by the light, and that the observed electrical effects are therefore in
the first instance due to chemical action.             The fact that the electro
 motive force of such a photo-electric cell is in the same direction as if
 the plates were immersed in water, the zinc becoming the anode, is
very suggestive.       At present, however, we must not attach too great
an importance to it.        I consider it quite possible that if the oxygen
 of the air is replaced by hydrogen, the currents would still be in the
same direction.        StoletowJ has examined the intensity of currents
sent from an outside electromotive force through an interval between
two parallel plates acting as electrodes, the kathode being illuminated
by ultra-violet light.       1 cannot at present attach any very great im
portance   to  the  experiments made with different gases. We know
 how very delicate the surface actions on which these currents depend
 are, and how the greater part of the effect may in some cases be due

to small traces of foreign gases or to the state of surface of the
electrode.
   The modifications of the disruptive discharge between platinum
electrodes, which have been studied by Wiedemann and Ebert,*
deserve to be mentioned, but they depend on too many circumstances
to help us in deciding the question as to the possible effects of
chemical action at the surface of the electrodes.              In order to obtain
an insight into these questions, it seems better to study the discharges
produced by radiation in cases where naturally a discharge would
not occur. This will probably lead to a simpler result than an in
vestigation of the modification by radiation of a discharge inde
pendently produced. The interesting facts discovered by Lenard and
 Wolf will be mentioned in connexion with another part of our subject.
                           Discharges through Flames.
    It was discovered by Paul Ermanf towards the beginning of this
century that a flame may conduct, and that a wire placed inside it
 discharges positive electricity more easily than negative electricity.
       J
 Buff found that even the gases rising from a flame behave as con
 ductors of electricity, and Giese has carefully examined the behaviour
of   these gases.     He was thereby led,      as has    already been mentioned,
 to the theory of electrolytic convection.           It seems indeed impossible
 to draw a different conclusion. We may assume that in a flame a
 certain proportion of dissociated ions are present, some of which can
 escape combination with each other for some time.                As the gases rise
 from the flame they will remain conductors until the recombination
of ions is complete, and this may take some time. According to
 Giese, the gases may preserve their conductivity for some minutes.
    Dissociation alone, it must be remembered, is not sufficient to
convert a gas into a conductor.           Thus, when owing to increased tem
perature the molecules of iodine vapour split up, the atoms do not
necessarily behave as ions, for they are probably unelectrified. We
 must imagine each iodine atom in the molecule to possess two
 charges, and as dissociation proceeds a re-arrangement of the charges
 takes place, so that the free atom will still carry two equal but now
opposite charges.
              Discharge through Oases        in  the Sensitive   State.
    It is convenient to say that a gas is in its sensitive state as regards
 e^ctric stress when any electromotive force, however small, pro-

duces a transference      of electricity.    I have shown that a discharge,
whether disruptive or continuous, throws the whole enclosure into a
sensitive state.     It has been suggested from various sides that some
of the phenomena described by me were due to illumination of ultra
violet light.                                         I
                 In order to decide the question, have divided a vacuum
tube into two parts by means of a quartz diaphragm ; a discharge
passed through one part of the tube and on that side the effects pre
viously described by me were again observed, but the quartz plate
completely destroyed the effect in the other compartment, while all
observers agree that quartz is transparent to the radiations which
produce electrical effects.
   Because E. Wiedemann*            finds (in accordance with Hallwachs'
experiment) that the leaves of an electroscope can be made to col
lapse when they are illuminated by an arc lamp, it hardly follows,
as implied by him, that this is the explanation of the same effect
observed by me when there was no arc lamp nor any light except the
feeble glow of a discharge carefully screened off from the gold leaves
by a metallic plate.       The above-mentioned experiment, which will be
described in detail in another communication, disposes of the question,
and shows that, independently of any ultra-violet radiation, the dis
charge puts the gas into a sensitive state in which it becomes a
conductor. According to the theory of electrolytic convection, this
should    be  so, because   the primary discharge supplies the necessary
ions.
                         Discussion of Unipolar Effects.
   It  is of interest to see whether we can trace any regularity in the
appearance of the unipolar effects, and whether there is any hope of a
general law which will allow us to predict when an electrode will be
positively, and when it will be negatively, unipolar.
   I  am aware of the dangers of premature generalisation, but, at the
same time, such generalisations as a rule do no harm except perhaps
to the reputation of the author; they have, on the other hand, the
advantage of putting the issue clearly before the reader, and often
 lead more quickly to a definite result than a mere statement of dis
connected facts.
                                           I
   As far as the facts go at present, am inclined to draw the follow
ing conclusion : — A free discharge of electricity between a negative ion
and the anode is possible.        On the other hand, a considerable fall of
potential is required in order to produce an exchange of electricity
between a positive ion and the kathode unless the electrode takes part
in a chemical action set up at its surface, in which case the rate ^f
exchange of charges at the kathode may become greater than that at the
anode.

               The Discharge     of Electricity through       Gases.        537
    A word is necessary to explain what I mean by a considerable fall
of potential at the electrode.        In electrolytes the fall of potential
within the double layer is of the order of magnitude of 1 volt ; such a
fall in itself would hardly make itself apparent in our measurements
in gas discharges. The observed fall of potential in vacuum tubes
at the kathode is measured in hundreds of volts, but it will appear
that within molecular distances the fall is many times smaller than
for electrolytes, so that the normal force at the kathode may be less
in gases than in electrolytes. The difference between an electrolyte
and a gas is this : that, while in a liquid the fall of potential only
takes place within a molecular range, in the gas it continues
through a measurable distance.            The cause of this, no doubt, has
to be explained, and an attempt will be made to do so. At present it
is sufficient to point out that a large fall of potential within,
say, a centimeter of the electrode is not inconsistent with the much
smaller fall observed within the double layer of liquids.               It must
also be kept in view that all measurements of potential in the
gas are made by means of secondary electrodes.              If a double layer of
the    same  moment    covers both  the   kathode    and   the  secondary elec-
tr ode, it would escape detection. There are some delicate questions
involved in this which will be discussed in the complete paper. The
main conclusions drawn in the text are not altered by the fuller dis
cussion of the problem.        A few facts may be quoted in support of
            I
the view have taken concerning the effect of chemical action at the
 kathode. A flame conducts, because in the flame the molecules are
 broken up by independent chemical action ; we find, in consequence,
 that an electrode can freely discharge positive electricity. On the
 other hand, a glowing piece of charcoal may act as electrode, because
 it takes part in a chemical action, but it is the negative electricity
 which now escapes freely.
     In a vacuum tube, whatever chemical action may take place at the
 kathode diminishes the fall of potential, as appears from Warburg's*
 observations, who finds that electrodes of zinc and copper in hydrogen,
 when first introduced and therefore probably covered with a film of
 oxide, show a considerably smaller fall of potential than after they
 have been used some time, when the oxide film may be supposed to
 have been removed.         In a similar manner a small admixture of
 moisture in nitrogen tubes, causos a considerable reduction in the
 fall of potential. As regards red-hot copper wires, we have seen
  that the passage of negative electricity from the electrode to the gas
  for small electromotive forces may be prevented altogether, if chemical
 action is prevented, while the electrode may still act as anode. Here
  it is the combined effect of temperature and electric stress that splits
  up the molecules into ions.

    Finally, the action of ultra-violet light, being probably of the nature
of a chemical action, at once destroys the impediments which prevent
 metals acting as kathodes.     The principal difficulty of tr. e explanation
 lies in the behaviour of white-hot platinum in hydrogec, but, as has
 already been explained, the platinum seems to undergo a molecular
 change    in that case, which may either be due to or equivalent to         a
 chemical action.
                 Properties of Oases  in their Sensitive State.
    A gas may be put into a sensitive state when the molecules are
 broken up into ions either by a discharge of electricity or by a
 chemical action as in a flame.      It is interesting to note the similarity
 of behaviour of gases made sensitive in these two ways.
    In a footnote to the paper, in which the theory of electrolytic con
 vection is brought forward by Giese, he suggests that the power of
 gases rising from flames to condense moisture, as shown by Aitken,
 may be due to the same cause as its power to conduct electricity.
 The question has been treated with great ability by R. v. Helmholtz,
 whose untimely death at an early age science has recently had to
 deplore.    R. v. Helmholtz was led to the enquiry by the discovery of
 an effort of electric discharges to act in the same way as solid nuclei
 would in precipitating the aqueous vapour from a moist gas. It
 would seem natural at first sight to ascribe this effect, as well as
 those previously described by Aitken, to the actual presence of dust
particles.    I  must refer the reader to Helmholtz's paper,* in which
this hypothesis is finally found to be insufficient and in which the
action of both flames and electric discharges is ascribed to the
presence of ions in the gas.     Messrs. Lenard and Wolff have recently
shown that when a metal, charged negatively, is exposed to ultra
violet light, the space in front of the discharging plate acts on a
steam jet like dust particles would.         They conclude from these re
searches that the ultra-violet light does actually disintegrate the
surface of the conductor.         Some of their experiments, however,
admit of a different interpretation ; the electric discharge itself, which
we know to take place under the circumstances, might be the cause
of the condensing power of the air. As far as the evidence goes, I
should say that the explanation given by Lenard and Wolf is the
more probable one, though it is not altogether proved as yet.            But
even admitting the presence of dust particles thrown off from the
conductor, it is still an open question whether the disintegration of
the electrode is the cause of the electric discharge or whether it is
only one of the phenomena attending it. We should expect a con-

siderable amount of energy to be required to convert the metal surface
partially into dust, and it seems doubtful whether the mere abs orption
of ultra-violet light is sufficient for the purpose. If the action of the
light is primarily a chemical one, the disintegration might be ex
plained, like the discharge itself, as a consequence of this chemical
action.
    The fact that flames behave as diamagnetic bodies has long been
known, and could be explained if we were free to assume that ions
are diamagnetic. From the point of view of Weber's theory of dia-
magnetics, this seems probable, and               I  made a few experiments in
order to prove in other ways the diamagnetism of ions.                    I have not
hitherto obtained decisive results, but some effects of magnets on the
discharge described in my previous Bakerian Lecture seem to me to
 point directly to such a diamagnetism.*
    From the point of view, then, of our theory, a gas is sensitive elec
 trically when it contains free ions. On the other hand, we must
 conclude that when a gas is not sensitive such free ions are not pre
 sent. 1 do not see how the insulating power of air at the ordinary
 temperature is consistent with the presence of ions, however few in
 numbers ; for, ultimately, a diffusion to the electrodes and a discharge
 would necessarily take place.            This seems to me to be fatal to J. J.
 Thomson's view of the disruptive discharge.f
                              The Continuous      Discharge.
                              Facts hitherto established.
     The first step towards the investigation of the continuous discharge
 is the . investigation of the relation between current and fall of
 potential in a gas through which a current is passing.                 An important
 fact discovered by HittorfJ relates to the fall of potential in the
 positive part of the discharge, that part which extends from the
 anode towards the negative glow.                Hittorf's law may be stated as
 follows :  —
     " In the positive part the discharge the rate
                               of                            of change of potential at
 a given pressure is independent of the current."
     The law was tested by Hittorf with currents which differed in in
  tensity nearly in the ratio of 1 to 50.
     As regards the negative glow, Hittorf chiefly experimented with
 electrodes in the form of wires running parallel to the axis of his
  tubes.    The glow for weak currents only covers the ends of the
 electrode, but as the intensity is increased it gradually extends back
 wards; daring this stage the rise of potential near the kathode

is independent of the current.          When the glow has completely
covered the kathode, a rise in the intensity of the current is accom
panied by an increased difference of potential between the kathode
and the surrounding portions of gas.
    Warburg* has studied the fall of potential near the kathode with
 electrodes made of different material and at different pressures.       It
is known that the negative glow consists of three parts : a luminous
layer directly adjacent to the kathode, the so-called dark space, and
the glow proper. As the density of the gas diminishes these layers
gradually expand ; but the difference of potential only changes slowly.
It has been stated that the difference of potential between a kathode
which i s not completely covered with the glow and some point in the
glow is independent of the intensity of the current ; Warburg calls it
the normal fall of potential.      While the fall is normal a change of
current is only accompanied by a change in the extent to which the
 kathode is covered with the glow. Warburg has shown how the
normal fall depends on the material of the electrode, the nature of
the gas, and the density, and his results are of considerable interest
f rom our point of view. Slight quantities of moisture added to nitrogen
 produce a considerable change in the difference of potential.       Thus,
with platinum electrodes nitrogen containing a small quantity of
 aqueous vapour gave a normal fall of 260 volts, while dry nitrogen
 gave 410 volts.    This is not due to the fact that aqueous vapour is a
 better conductor   than  nitrogen, for, if more than traces of moisture
are p resent, the fall of potential is as great or greater than with dry
 nitrogen. We must, on the other hand, find in these observations a
 strong support of our view, that the difficulty of passage of positive
 electricity from the gas to the electrode is much reduced by chemical
 actions at the electrodes.    The effects of small traces of moisture are
 so similar to those investigated by Dixon and others in chemical re
 action b etween gases and between a solid and a gas, that in my
 opinion we really have no choice but to adopt some such view as          I
h ave taken of the matter. Warburg draws the same conclusion from
his experiments.
    The effects of deoxidation of the electrodes, where zinc or steel
kathodes are used in hydrogen, makes itself apparent by con
siderable reduction of the fall of potential near the kathode, which
disappears when the layer of oxide on the kathode has been removed
 by disintegration of its surface.    A change of pressure, according to
Warburg, is only accompanied by a slight change in the normal fall
of potential.

                 Volume Electrification near the Kathode.
   I have  spent considerable time during the last few years in in
vestigating the fall of potential in the different parts of the negative
glow with a view to deciding whether there is any considerable
volume electrification of the gas itself.
   De la Rue and Muller* have already endeavoured to measure the
potential at different places in the dark space ; but for some reason,
which I cannot trace, their results are altogether anomalous.              They
used what they call four different arrangements of leads, which,
however, all should give identical results ; but no regularity can be
traced. In many cases they found that the potential becomes more and
more negative away from the kathode, so that in one of their observa
tions some point in the dark space was at a potential — 1068 volt,
the negative electrode being at potential zero. I have never observed
anything but a regular increase of potential within the dark space.
In order to be able to subject the results of experiments to a simple
analysis, I have used two different kinds of vessel.            In one the lines
of flow were, throughout, parallel to each other ; this I shall call the
axial discharge. Cylindrical tubes were used, and the kathode was
a closely fitting aluminium plate, care being taken to prevent a
discharge from the back. The other vessels used were large cylin
drical receivers, the kathode being a wire forming the axis of the
cylinder, and the anode a cylinder made of wire gauze. The lines
of flow in these vessels were radii drawn from the axis of the
cylinder, and I shall call the discharge in this case the radial dis
charge. The fall of potential between the kathode and any point
inside the negative glow was found to be capable of being repre
sented by the formula
                                                                i
                             V = V.(l-e-«)                                  (1.),
where   V   is the   potential   at any point, V0 the potential in the
glow proper,   k a constant,     and    x the distance from the kathode.
The potential of the kathode is taken as zero. The formula is not
meant to be more than an approximate one, but within the limits of
error of experiment the formula may be taken as correct through the
dark space and the inner parts of the glow. It may, in the first
place, only be considered as an interpolation formula, and others
might be found representing the facts equally well, but the equation
gains some reality owing to the fact that « for a given pressure is
found to be very nearly independent of the strength of the current.
The complete account of my experiments will show how far this is
correct. Owing to the circumstances of the case, the fall of potential

 could not be altered more than in the ratio of one to two, and it is
  not possible to tell, therefore, how far the above will express the
  results for a greater change in the current density. The constancy
  of k depends on the fact which       I have verified within these limits of
  currents, that the potentials at different points of the negative glow all
  rise and fall in the same ratio when the current is altered, the kathode
 being at zero potential.
      From the characteristic     equation for the potential, which in our
 case reduces to

 in which    v stands for the velocity of light, we may now deduce p, or
 the volume-density of electricity near the kathode.
     The law which   I  have given above suggests at once that p is a linear
function of V or its differential coefficients, for it implies that if V is
any solution of the characteristic equation, W must also be a solution.
The question will be discussed in the complete account of these ex
periments, and it is not necessary to enter into it here. From equa
tion (1) we derive
                               Ainfip = ic'Voe-"                        (2.),
which shows that the kathode is covered with an atmosphere of positively
charged particles diminishing outwards in volume-density .
     The law of variation of density is the same as that found in the
atmosphere near the earth's surface ; but the mathematical conditions
are very different.      The gravitational force near the earth is sensibly
constant, while the electrical forces near the kathode vary as much
as the density.
     If the curve which connects V and x is plotted, its curvature, and
therefore the electrification, can be traced through the dark space
and into the negative glow, but inside the glow it rapidly diminishes.
The formula for p does not lay claim to more than an approximate
expression of the facts, which may, however, in default of more
accurate knowledge help us to form some idea of the distribution of
volume-density.        Even though (1) may bold with considerable
accuracy, (2) may not give correct results for those parts of the glow
which are close up to the electrode ; for the curve representing V
near the origin is a very steep line, slightly curved. A small change
in the curvature will make a considerable change in p, without
affecting the main curve to an appreciable extent.           It seems prob
able, however, that the electrification continues to increase up to
the electrode itself, and that the formula will express the main
features of the distribution.        When the liues of flow are radial the
law of distribution of volume-density is less simple, but the general
result is the same.

               The Discharge   of Electricity through    Gases.         543
    It is interesting to gain some idea of the charges in absolute
units which are involved, and of the number of charged ions taking
part in the discharge according to our theory. The electrification at
the surface according to (2) is V0(c2/4jti>2.   In a series of experiments
in which V0 varied from 672 to 1330 volts, and the current between
400 and 3000 microamperes, 'r2V0 was found to vary between 3 x 1012
and 10ls C.G.S. units. Taking the highest value, we find p = 10-9
C.G.S. electromagnetic units, or about 30 electrostatic units. From
this   I  calculate that the mass of electrified atoms per unit volume is
 7 x 10-13, on the supposition that the charges are carried by
nitrogen-atoms.      The density of nitrogen in the experiment which
forms the basis of this calculation is 5 x 10-7, so that even close up
to the electrode the surplus of positive ions is very small compared
to the number of atoms and molecules present, only about one molecule
 in a million being decomposed.       Further away from the kathode the
 relative amount of charged to uncharged particles is considerably
 smaller still. The volume-density, which is derived from calculation,
 gives us, of course, the difference only between the sum of the posi
 tive and the sum of the negative charges.       The value of this excess of
 positive charges    cannot therefore  be taken  as a measure of the total
 number of ions present, except perhaps close up to the electrode.
 In how far the positive charges in the polarising layer and the
 negative charges projected away from the kathode are alone sufficient
 to account for the whole current, cannot be decided at present.        The
 mutual repulsion of the particles within the atmosphere of positive
 particles which surrounds the kathode explains at once the tendency
 of the glow to spread all over the surface of the electrode.         Other
 important facts, such as the effects of an anode near the kathode in
 driving away the glow, will also find their natural explanation. The
 spreading of the glow over the negative electrode is tho cause of a
 series of peculiar differences which appear at the two poles even
 in the case of discontinuous discharges.         The differences observed
 in Lichtenberg's figure and in Priestley's rings, according as the dis
 charging point is positive or negative, seem to me to be readily ex
 plained by the atmosphere of positive ions which always tends to
 spread all over the kathode, while the discharge from a positive elec
 trode is confined to the points of maximum electric density.        It will
 lead me too far to enter into these questions here ; but one objection
  must be met : why does this positive electrification not make itself
 apparent by electrical action in the space outside ; and why do elec
 trified bodies outside not act on the glow ?
     As regards the first question, the charge is not really a large one.
  The whole quantity of electricity in the glow per square centimeter
  cross-section would, according to the formula, be —

 544                          Mr. A. Schuster.
 where dVjdx stands for the fall of potential at the kathode. In my ex
 periments this quantity has been smaller than 1012 C.G.S., so that the
maximum total charge per centimeter cross section would amount to
 about three electrostatic units. The effect of this electrification
 would be completely hidden by the charges on the outside of the
 glass tube, which cannot be avoided when we are dealing with a
thousand volts.      In fact, the leakage over the glass will act as an
 electrical screen.
   It also appears that electrified bodies outside cannot produce any
effect on the inside of the tube, because it can be shown from my
previous work that the surface conditions in the interior of a gas
through which a discharge passes render a normal force at the
surface impossible.      Hence no lines of force can pass from the out
side to the inside. If an electrified body is approached, a momentary
redistribution of the surface charge inside the vessel will take place ;
but after the readjustment no further effect can be observed.
   It is generally stated that a greater electromotive force is required
to start a discharge than to maintain it after it is once started.    This
statement requires qualification.     The fall of potential in the positive
part of the tube is of course much smaller during discharge than it was
just before, but it does not follow that the rate of fall at the negative
electrode is less.    In one experiment the rate of fall at the kathode
at a pressure of 6 mm. was 9000 volts per centimeter, while the
whole of my battery only had a difference of potential of less than
2000 volts. According to De la Rue and Miiller, it requires a fall of
about 1800 volts to start a discharge between two parallel plates at
a pressure of 10 mm.       Their measurements do not extend to smaller
pressures,   but a  discharge would be started at the pressure of about
| mm. by a less electromotive force than at a pressure of 10 mm. It
follows that while the discharge is passing, in most if not in all my
experiments, the fall of potential was much greater than that required
to start it, and if we adopt the view that the breaking down of the
insulation is in part due to a decomposition of the molecules, it
follows that the molecules must continue to be decomposed during
the discharge. This we shall find to be a result of importance.
   The charge on platinum eltctrodes in liquids is much greater than
the charge on the surface of the kathode in a gas ; with the usual data
I make it about 10,000 times greater. This would explain the
absence of observable polarisation in the case of the gas discharge,
out it seems surprising that any electricity should pass at all under
the circumstances, between the gas and the electrode.          My calcula
tions, however, depend on the extension of an experimental formula

up to the electrode, which may not be justifiable; but another expla
nation is possible.       If we ask at what distance from the kathode is
the potential 1 volt less than at the kathode itself, we find it to be
abont the thousandth part of a millimeter.                  It will constantly
happen that particles will approach the kathode from that distance,
and the work which has to be done in the transference of the positive
ion to the electrode may be partially supplied by the energy acquired
in the fall.

   In my former paper          I  described a method by means of which        I
boped   to be able   to  measure    the charges carried by the ions, and thus
directly to test the truth of the theory. It is clearly most desirable
that this shonld be done, for if it could be shown that the molecular
charges are the same as those carried by the atoms in electrolytes, all
further doubt as to the correctness of the view which I advocate
would vanish. I have met with very considerable difficulties in the
attempt to carry out the measurements in a satisfactory manner,
and have only hitherto succeeded in fixing somewhat wide limits
between which the molecular charges must lie.
   According to one theory, particles are projected from the kathode.
The observed effect of the magnet on them is exactly what it should
be under the circumstances.           The path of the particles can be traced
by means     of the luminosity         produced by the molecular impacts.
If  the trajectory is originally straight, it bends under the influence of
¦& magnet.     The curvature of the rays depends on two unknown
quantities, the velocity of the particles and the quantity of electricity
they carry.
   If the particles carrying a charge are moving with velocity at right
angles to the lines of force, the radius of curvature r is determined
by the equation
                      <^=Mve             or

where tn is the mass of the particle. If the particles originally at
rest, start from the kathode at which the potential is taken as zero,
and arrive, without loss of energy, at a place where the potential is
V, we should have another equation, namely : —

     The quantity ejm thus obtained can be directly compared with the
 known    electro- chemical equivalents.    The assumption that in the
 passage of the particles, the whole work done appears as accelera
 tion can never be perfectly realised, and experiments only can decide
 how nearly we may approach it. In the dark space surrounding the
 kathode the dissipation of energy is probably small, and we have
 every reason to believe that there the velocities are very high. I need
not enter here into the many experimental difficulties which I have
 encountered, and which       I hope soon to overcome more completely
 than I have yet been able to do. In the experiments hitherto carried
 on equation (2) cannot be assumed to hold. The equation (3) may
 be used, however, to fix an upper limit for ejm.       A lower limit can
be calculated as follows : — As long as the effect of the magnet on the
 particles projected from the kathode shows any directional preponde
 rance, we may take it that the velocities of the particles must be
greater than the mean velocity in their normal state. For it is clear
 that, if distribution of velocities was symmetrical in all directions, the
 magnet would have equal and opposite effects on the charges which
 move in opposite directions ; and if by mutual impacts the velocity is
 reduced to its normal value, it will also have lost any directional
  inequality.   We may obtain a lower limit for ejm if in equation (1)
we calculate
                                  m   ~Mr                              K  h
 by putting for r the smallest radius of curvature which can with
 certainty be traced in the glow, and for t the mean velocity of the
 particle, according to the kinetic theory of gases.
     In an actual experiment M was 200 ; r diminished with increasing
  distance from the kathode.       The greatest value which could with
  certainty be measured was about 1 cm. V was 225 volts at the same
 place.    Taking these numbers, we get for the upper limit
                               — <   11 x  106.
                               m
     In the glow the radius of curvature is quickly reduced to about
 J  cm., showing that the luminosity is directly due to a conversion of
 directional into thermal motion. The gas in the actual experiment
 was nitrogen much contaminated with hydrocarbons. The value of
 the mean velocity in the state of equilibrium will depend on the
 supposition we make as to the nature of the particle which carries
the charge.
    It will be sufficient to consider the cases indicated in the following
table:—

temperature need not be taken into account, and we may take v to be

   The actual value of ejm is 10* for hydrogen and 07 X 103 for
nitrogen, if we imagine each atom of nitrogen to carry the same
charge as the atom of hydrogen in water ; but, as nitrogen may unite
with these atoms of nitrogen we must assume three charges at least
to be carried, which would make ejm equal to 2 X 103.
   It thus appears that there is nothing in the actual facts which is
in any way not in harmony with the theory. The lower limit for e/m
comes very near the actually observed values, and it is not astonishing
that the upper limit yields so great a value. It will be seen that in
equation (3) the radius of curvature enters as the square.               I  think I
may take the experiments hitherto recorded as a confirmation of the
theory. Assuming the theory to be correct, they show that in the
glow the particles are quickly reduced to a velocity of the same order
of magnitude as the mean velocity in an unelectrified medium. If
the particles do not carry fixed charges, they must become electrified
by contact at the electrodes. This is the view generally taken, and it
is interesting to trace its consequences.           The change e of a sphere
touching   a plane charged with surface density a is* given by
                  e = §  ir3a2o = 20 ara approximately.
   Substituting for a the highest value which            I have obtained in my
experiments, about 2-5 electrostatic units, e would be numerically
equal to 50a2. If for a2 we take about 5 X 10"]0, which is the
molecular range obtained from experiments in gases, we should be
above the mark.      This, when substituted in the above, gives for e
the value 10"17 in electrostatic units, instead of 10~12, that is, the
charge would be about 100,000 times less than according to our
theory. Applying the equation (4), I calculate that, according to
the hypothesis of electrification by contact, the average velocity of
the molecules would only have been 2 cm. a second, which is a reductio
ad absurdum.

             Some Questions relating     to the Positive Discharge.
    There is one theory of electric discharges which, as a scientific
¦curiosity, is of interest.    It asserts that a perfect vacuum is a perfect
conductor, but that the molecules flying about the vacuum impede
the passage of the current.         If no discharge actually passes through
highly rarefied gas in an experiment, it is, according to this view,
because there is a resistance at the surface of the electrodes.        It is
interesting to speculate what the world would be like if this theory
was true.      It is perhaps not fair to urge that we should live in per
petual darkness, because the upholders of the theory could not con
sistently adopt the electro-magnetic theory of light, whose essence is a
stress in the medium.        But I do not see how we should have any elec
trostatic effects at all, at any rate in highly exhausted vessels. In order
that gold leaves should remain divergent in vacuo, it is by no means ne
cessary that no escape of electricity should take place from them. They
will collapse, though their surface may be perfectly impermeable to the
discharge, as long as currents may flow in the surrounding medium.         If
the gold leaves are charged positively, negative electricity would flow
towards them, cover them, and protect the leaves, so as to prevent
any repulsion. There are other fatal objections against the theory
which will survive nevertheless, for, like all paradoxes, it has an
irresistible attraction to a great many minds.
    The following experiment has convinced those to whom I have
been able to show it that the discharge consists of a diffusion of
charged atoms or molecules.          The apparatus used is that by means
of which Balfour Stewart and Tait have carried on their researches
on the heating of a rotating disc in vacuo. In front of an ebonite
 disc, electrodes were introduced so that the line joining them was
 parallel to the plane of the disc, viz., one electrode opposite the
centre, and the other opposite the edge of the disc. When the latter
 is rotated, it carries round with it the air in its neighbourhood.        If
 the current consisted of a motion of the medium, the particles of air
could not affect the distribution of the lines of flow. But it is found
 that the discharge is drawn up or down according as the motion of
 the air is upwards or downwards.            The curves formed by the dis
 charge    are  similar   to  those   observed   when a magnet acts on a
 positive discharge, and their cause is identical, as the magnetic force
 also acts on the particles, and tends to draw them through the
 discharge, as I have explained in my previous Bakerian Lecture.
    Photographs of the actual appearance have been taken, and will
 be given in the full account of these experiments. It is very striking
 to see the discharge steadily and slowly deflected by the rotating disc,
 and so sensitive is it to slight currents in the air, that the heating
 of the gas by the discharge and the convection currents formed in

               The Discharge     of Electricity through   Gases.         549
consequence     are quite sufficient to cause a decided       bending, even
without    any rotation of the disc.
      Magnitude of     some of the Quantities involved in the Discharge.
   As it is necessary to bear in mind the order of magnitude of some
of the quantities involved in the discharge,        I may  briefly note some
of the  most important ones.
   The most probable value for the charge carried by each atom of
hydrogen I find to be 3 x 10-23 electro-magnetic units, more generally,
say, 3k x 10-23 where * is a numerical constant.
   Question I : — How does the energy acquired by an ion between
two impacts compare with the average kinetic energy of a molecule ?
   Answer : — The ratio ejm for hydrogen is known to be 10* approxi
mately. If a particle of mass to carries a charge e, the velocity
generated from rest through a range in which the difference of
potential is V is
                            V    2eV
                                       or   140  JY.
   If V    is one volt, this would be equal to 14 x 105 ; a quantity
nearly ten times as great as the mean velocity of a hydrogen
molecule.     In the positive part of the discharge when the velocity of
diffusion is uniform, the fall of potential in my experiments was,
roughly speaking, about 1 volt per millimeter; the mean free path
calculated according to the kinetic theory varied between              \ mm.
and £ mm. Hence, on the average, the velocity generated in the
atom by electric forces between two encounters exceeds several
times the mean velocity in the stationary state.         It will appear that
the number of atoms carrying charges is small compared to the total
number; so that the actually observed rise in temperature need not
be considerable. At each impact the atom must give up, on the
average, that proportion of its own velocity which it gains during
two encounters; and the above numbers show that the energy
communicated is very considerable.            Hence the luminosity of the
positive discharge.       Even  if by an  impact the ions are thrown back,
the electromotive force will, in general, be strong enough to reduce
it to re3t, and send it forward before the next impact. The path of
particles will therefore not be straight, aud the velocity of the ions
before impact will almost entirely be in the direction in which the
force acts.
   Question    II : — If the molecules, each charged with a quantity of
electricity e, approach each other with a velocity equal to the mean
speed    in a homogeneous gas at ordinary temperature, at what
distance from each other will they come to rest ?
                                                                             S

550                              Mr. A. Schuster.
    Answer: — If        v  is  taken as 17x10*, and e = 3k x 10-23, the
distance is 2* x 10~8, which is larger, though not considerably so,
than the molecular distance.              We conclude that two particles
charged with the same kind of electricity will, in general, not
approach each other sufficiently near to bring other than electrical
forces into play.
    Question    III  : — At what distance is the force between        two equally
charged atoms equal to the force in a field in which the fall of
potential is 1 volt per centimeter ?
    Answer: — r = y3ic . 10~5.           If the fall is 1 volt per mm., the
distance would be three times as great, or about 5 x 10-6.
    Question IV : — What is the proportion of ions amongst the
molecules in the positive part of the discharge ?
                  I
    Answer: — assume, as a first approximation, the velocity of
diffusion to be that of the mean velocity of the gas in the normal
state.     (One measurement of the magnetic deflection in the glow
shows that the velocity of diffusion cannot be much greater, and the
answer to Question          II shows that it cannot be much smaller.)             If
 S is the cross-section of the tube, C the current, and n the number
 of ions, we have
                                nSev = C    ;  Km =   p,
 where    N  is the number of undecomposed molecules, and p the density
 of the   gas.    Combining the two equations :
                                   n          mC
                                   N      S.e.v.p
    In  a typical example, p was 5 x 10-7        ; C =  3 x 10~* ;  S =   2 ; and as
  -=    104, we   find
 TO
                                 «/N =    |   x 10-6,
 a small fraction, which is suggestively near the fraction obtained for
the proportion of positive ions in close contact with the kathode ;
 the two results being observed from altogether different quantities.
                    —
    Question V : What is the average distance between the ions in
 the positive part of the discharge ?
    Answer: — With the same data as in Question IV,                 I  find for the
 average    distance     approximately 10~2,    or ^  mm.
       Probable Explanation of       the  Fall of Potential   observed   at the
                                      Kathode.
    In    carrying ont the investigation of which the experiments
  described in this paper form a part, I have always attached most

              The Discharge    of Electricity through       Gases.       551
importance to the clearing up of those questions on which the
mathematical analysis of the subject will have to be based. From
this point of view, nothing is of greater importance than the
investigation of the surface conditions which must hold between the
gas and the vessel, and between the gas and the electrodes.             In a
previous paper,* I have shown that at any part of the surface of the
gas through which no electricity passes the normal forces must
 vanish, which is not a priori evident, if we consider the gas to
 possess a certain dielectric strength.         The fall of potential at the
 kathode must depend on the surface conditions which hold there, and
the following considerations may help to clear up the question.
    Imagine, in the first instance, a gas containing a certain number
of charged particles, and enclosed in a vessel kept at zero potential,
but having a surface impermeable to electricity. We may not be
able to realise these conditions, but we may discuss the problem as an
ideal case.
    How will tho charged particles arrange themselves under the
 influence of their mutual forces ?           They will, no doubt, travel
 outwards towards the surface, but will they cling to the surface,
condensing, as it were, to form a layer against the solid surface
 resembling a liquid more than a gas ? Or will they form a gaseous
atmosphere, diminishing in density from the surface outwards ? Or,
finally, will they resemble the state of a liquid in contact with a gas,
that is to say, will they be in a state of movable equilibrium, a
certain proportion always clinging to the surface of the solid, others
 flying away until brought back by impacts and electric forces ? I do
 not see how the answer to these questions can be given on the
theoretical grounds only, and it seems to me that experiment only
can decide it. Nor is it necessary, to my mind, that an atmosphere
of positive ions should behave exactly in the same way as an
atmosphere of negative ions.       The only consistent theory of contact
 electricity we possess is that worked out by Helmholtz, according to
 which we must, in calculating the work done in the transfer of
 electricity through a surface, not only take account of electric but
 also of electro-chemical forces. There are various ways of expressing
 the same fact. We may say that there must be a definite attraction
 between matter and electricity, or we may say that the potential
 energy of a system contains terms involving both electrical and
 chemical variables, or, finally, that both chemical and electrical
 forces are due to stresses in the medium, and that in calculating the
 forces we must add the displacements and not the energies.
    In considering the mutual action between electrified particles at
 molecular distances, it is quite possible, and even probable, that
 positive and negative electrification may affect the molecular forces
                   * 'Boy. Soc. Proe.,' vol.42,  p. 371 (1887).

in different ways. The same holds as regards the action between
electrified and non-electrified particles. If the theory of electrolytic
convection in gases is true, some hypothesis of this nature is
necessary to explain the asymmetry of the discharge. Positive ions,
according to the theory, will be delivered at the kathode, either by
direct decomposition or by diffusion ; negative ions will, in the same
way, appear at the anode. If, as we must assume by analogy from
liquids, a certain normal force is required to effect the interchange of
electricities at the electrode, this will become covered, in the first
instance, with the ions until the necessary normal force is obtained
But we are face to face with the questions previously raised relating
to the distribution of ions against the surface of the kathode. If
the conditions are such that positive gaseous ions behave partly, at
any rate, as a gas ; if, instead of clinging to the electrode, they form
an atmosphere      round       the fall of potential at the kathode
                             it,                                           is
explained. The law according to which their density diminishes as
the distance from the electrode increases depends on an experi
mental term, as has been stated, and         have not yet arrived at a
                                                I
satisfactory theoretical foundation for the law but various supposi

tions may be made, and       ifwe may imagine the layer of positive ions
to behave like a thin liquid film having a definite vapour pressure,
we may easily imagine that the falling off will take place very mucii
as it   actually does.     The large fall of potential at the kathode,
according to this view,       not so much due to the amount of work
                             is
which has to be done to effect the interchange of electricity, but
chiefly to the fact that for the same surface density at the kathode
the thickness of the polarising layer              greater, which must
                                                      is
necessarily increase the fall of potential. Thus,        a    the surface

layer from the kathode was 1/*: instead of the molecular distances.
The numerical values for 1/k are, on the average, about six or seven
times as great as the mean free path.

A positive charge will attract the negative ions, which will arrange
themselves on the surface, and the requisite difference of potential
will at once establish itself. But if a conductor placed in the flame
carries a negative charge, the layer within which the positive ions
collect will ,be deeper, and the potential of the conductor may not bo
sufficient to complete the layer so as to produce the necessary normal
force.
    It also appears that, just as minnte chemical changes affect the
polarisation in the electrolyte, so will all similar changes affect in
the same proportion the fall of potential at the kathode.          I
                                                                If am
right, we must consider the conditions of impact between the metal
and the ions, or between the gas and the ions, to be different accord
ing as the ions have a positive or negative charge, and this leads
 ns to the next point which it will be necessary to discuss.
    If the law of impact is different between the molecules of the gas
 and the positive and negative ions respectively, it follows that the
 rate of diffusion of the two sets of ions will in general be different ;
 let ns see whether we can find any experimental evidence which
 may throw light on this point.           I think there is some reason
to believe that the negative ions diffuse more rapidly, and we may
 at once trace one cf the consequences of such a difference of diffu
 sion. Looking at the positive part of the discharge, which shows no
 signs of a bodily electrification anywhere, at any rate when there aro
 no stratifications, a quicker negative diffusion means, just as in the
 case of the so-called migrations in electrolytes, an accumulation of
 ions at the positive pole. That is to say, at the anode a certain
 number of the ions must recombine again to form a neutral molecule.
 It has already been mentioned that at the kathode we must imagine
 decompositions to be going on, continuing during the discharge,
 because we know that the necessary electrical forces are maintained
 there. If the discharge is steady, then decomposed atoms must unite
 somewhere,     and, as just suggested, the reunion may take place
 at the anode ; or it may already take place in or just beyond the
 negative glow. The two questions are intimately connected.        If the
 molecules are decomposed in one part of the tube and reunite in
 another, the ions in between cannot travel at the same rate.      What
 leads me to believe in a quicker diffusion of negative ions is the
 fact described in my former paper, that in the neighbourhood of a
 discharge, positive bodies apparently become neutralised more quickly
 than negative ones. I think there runs throughout the whole set of
 experiments a general tendency for the negative ions to be drawn
 more quickly than positive ions towards the oppositely charged
 bodies. Some observations on flames also point the same way. Gold

stein found, in some of his experiments, that when an electric current
passing through a gas is forced through a narrow opening many of
the phenomena seen near the kathode appear on that side of the
opening which faces the positive pole.          It is also known that, if a
current passes through a funnel-shaped opening, the fall of potential
required is greater in one direction than in the other. Finally, if the
current is discontinuous, and a point on the outside of a glass tube is
connected to earth, certain phenomena are seen which have been spe
cially investigated by Messrs. Spottiswoode and Moulton.           All these
       I
facts believe to be capable of explanation if we remember that, when
ever a current passes between solids of different conductivities, a
certain surface electrification is necessary to satisfy the conditions of
continuity.    Gases do not follow Ohm's law, and there will in all
probability be an electrification whenever the cross-section alters.
The different behaviour of positive and negative electrification will
come into play, and this, together with the different rate of diffusion
of different ions, will,   I  believe, be found sufficient to explain the
 phenomena.
   The effect of ultra-violet    light on  a negatively electrified body is
probably due, as has been pointed out, to a chemical action, but we
have further to assume that this action is not set up on a positively
charged body.      If this view is correct, we shall have to take the law
of impacts between the gas and the metal to be modified in such a
 way that a chemical effect only takes place when the metal is
 charged negatively.
                               Stratifications.
    It is generally considered that the most important test of any
 theory of the discharge is to be found in the way in which it can
 explain stratification. Very little is known about the circumstances
 which produce stratifications, and they show by their lawless be
 haviour that they are rather to be considered as irregularities in the
 discharge than as matters of primary importance.
    According to our view, the regular diffusion of ions in the positive
 part of the discharge can only be maintained by a balance of very
 delicately-adjusted phenomena.        The two kinds of ions diffuse with
 different velocities ; they will tend to recombine together, and will
 occasionally do so. If so, and if the current does not cease to be
 steady, we must have as many fresh dissociations as combinations in
 each part of the tube.     It does not seem impossible that there may
 be several stable ways in which the current may pass.         It is possible
 that, besides the discharge which passes as          I have just explained,
 there may be another in which the tube is divided into a succession
 of parts in which the decompositions            alternately outnumber the

                The Discharge   of Electricity through   Gases.           555
recombinations and vice versa. Such a tube would show phenomena
very similar to stratifications. This is only a suggestion to show that
the theory may ultimately be found sufficient to cope with this diffi
culty.    At present it seems to me to be an open question whether the
stratifications are ever seen in perfectly pure gases.
                                The Dark Space.
    No satisfactory explanation has yet been given of the division of
the appearance round the kathode into three parts : the first luminous
layer, the dark space, and the glow. The division between the dark
space and the glow is often very sharp, and it is necessary to discuss
how the rapid change in luminosity can be accounted for. It has
been suggested that the extent of the dark space represents the mean
free path of the molecules.          If particles are projected from the
kathode    at  low   pressures, comparatively few will impinge in its
immediate neighbourhood, but with increasing distance the number
of impacts will increase. It has been pointed out by others that the
extent of the dark space is really considerably greater than the mean
 free path of the molecule, calculated according to the ordinary way.
 My measurements make it nearly twenty times as great. This,
 however, is not in itself a fatal objection, for, as we have seen, the
 mean free path of an ion may be different from that of a molecule
 moving among others.        I cannot, however, reconcile the sharpness of
 the inner boundary of the glow with the explanation given. If the
 luminosity only depended on the number of impacts, we should
expect the parts adjacent to the electrode to be dark and gradually to
 increase in intensity outwards.       The positive ions approaching the
 kathode would still further reduce the difference in luminosity.           I
have endeavoured to ascertain the experimental conditions which
determine the shape of the boundary of the dark space.            The first
 supposition tested was, whether the boundary was always an equi-
 potenti,il surface.   If so, the velocity of the particle projected from
 the negative electrode would be the same all over the boundary, and
 we might imagine that the luminous appearance of the glow depends
on some minimum kinetic energy which the impinging particles must
possess.    The darkness  is,   however, not limited by an equipotential
surface.
    A large cylindrical vessel contained two negative electrodes parallel
to the axis of the vessel. The anode was formed by            a cylindrical
wire netting surrounding the kathodes.          Under these circumstances
the dark space and glow present some peculiarities, which             shall
                                                                      I
describe on another occasion.       The shadow phenomena described by
 Goldstein are beautifully seen, and can be photographed, and as the
sides of the glass vessel do not interfere (as    it now appears they did
  VOL. XLV1I.                                                     2   s

in Goldstein's original experiments),   I have been able to supplement
his observations in several details.   At present I only wish to state
that the edge of the dark space is, under these circumstances, far
from being an equipotential surface ; so we must look for some other
 explanation. We can assure ourselves in another way that it is not
 a certain minimum kinetic energy which determines the boundary of
 the dark space.    In my previous Bakerian Lecture I followed others
 in the statement that an increase of current diminishes the thickness
 of the dark space ; but this I find is not correct. If the dark space
is carefully watched while the current is diminished or increased by
altering the resistance of the circuit, it is seen to contract or expand
slightly, always being widest when the current is strongest.        Such
an increase of current is accompanied by an increased fall of potential ;
the difference of the potential at which the dark space ends can
therefore be altered at will.
   I can at present only think of one way of accounting for the facts,
but wish for the present to express my views on this point with due
caution.
   From the magnetic experiments it appears that the velocities of
the molecules are reduced quickly in the luminous glow, but not at
any rate to the same exteut in the dark space. If that is the case,
there must be some change in the law of impacts, as we pass from the
dark space into the glow ; and the simplest supposition to make seems
to me to be that the strength of the electric field is an important
factor in the transformation of energy which takes place in the colli
sions. We may imagine that if the electric field is sufficiently strong,
the ion will not lose much of its energy during impact, but that in a
weak field the velocities are reduced at a much quicker rate.       It is
clear that if the molecular forces are strong, two molecules must
approach much more closely together before their mutual action
comes into play, and therefore what must be considered an impact
must happen more seldom in a strong than in a weak field. Near the
edge of the dark space the electric forces are found to diminish very
rapidly, and it is a question worth investigating whether the edwe of
the dark space is a surface at which the electric force has some con
stant critical value.   I know of no facts which are against this view
and my experiments have hitherto all been consistent with it.        The
slight widening of the dark space by increase of current would at
once be explained if my hypothesis is correct.        In the above-men
tioned case of two parallel kathodes, there is always a luminous layer
in the equidistant plane between them, even when the width of the
dark space due to one kathode alone extends sufficiently far to include
the other.    In this plane the fall of potential is easily seen to be
small, and the shape which the dark space assumes seems to me to
agree very well with the supposition that there is a critical rate of

               The Discharge    of Electricity through Gases.        557
potential which determines the edge of glow. Bat this point mnst
be left to be settled by future experiments.
   As regards the inner luminous layer closely adjacent to the negative
electrode, it seems due to the positive ions approaching the kathode,
and not, like the glow, to the negative ions projected away from it.
This is shown by the fact that a wire placed inside this layer casts a
shadow towards the kathode, and also by the distortion it experiences
in a magnetic field. It is remarkable that this luminosity, due to the
impact of positive ions, shows according to Goldstein, at any rate in
the case of nitrogen, the spectrum of the positive part of the dis
charge.
                                 Conclusion.
    We may now in conclusion shortly summarise the results arrived
at.   A gas in its normal state contains no free ions, but, if through
any chemical or physical causes the molecules are broken up in an
electric field, ions form, and the gas becomes a conductor. Supposing
the difference of potential of two electrodes is gradually increased,
a point will be reached at which a spark will pass, that is to say, the
molecules will be broken up by electric forces, the positive ions dif
fusing towards the kathode will tend to form a polarising layer of
finite thickness, increasing in width as the pressure diminishes.       If
the discharge becomes steady, the decompositions are continuously
kept up at the kathode, the negative ions being projected with great
velocity away from it. These ions will move through the so-cnlled
dark space without much loss of energy by impacts, but when, prob
ably owing to sufficient diminution in the electric force, the impacts
become more frequent, the translational energy becomes transformed
into the luminous vibrations of the glow. The positive ions forming
an atmosphere round the kathode must have a greater velocity the
nearer the kathode, where their energy becomes visible in the first
luminous layer.      Whether decompositions take place only at the elec
trode or through a finite distance from it is at present an open
question, nor can we decide as yet whether the negative molecules
projected outwards are the main carriers of the current inside the
dark space. In the dark space the negative ions will accumulate and
meet the positive ions proceeding from the positive part of the dis
charge. We shall expect at some point towards the outside of the
glow the free ions to become more numerous than in other parts of
the discharge.      Here we find a small fall of potential and no lumi
nosity ;  this  is the  dark interval separating the positive part of the
 discharge from the negative glow. A number of ions probably
 reunite in this part to form molecules, and in case it should ultimately
 be found that positive and negative ions diffuse with the same velo
 city, we should have to conclude that as many molecules as are

558                            Mr. A. Schuster.
decomposed at the kathode recombine in this dark interval.                If, as
seems    more  probable   to me, it  should  be found  that  the  negative ions
diffuse more rapidly, the recombination will in part take place at the
anode. If the conditions in the tube are such that the gas may divide
into layers, such that in alternate strata the decompositions outnumber
the recombinations, and vice versa, stratifications will form.
     Such is the general outline of the theory, which may have to be
modified in detail, but which, I believe, has a strong element of truth
in it.
     The possibility of a volume electrification is denied by some of
Maxwell's disciples, who look on a current of electricity as on a flow of
an incompressible liquid in a closed circuit.         But there is nothing, as
far   as I can see,  in the  conclusions   I  have  drawn   from the gas dis
charges which is inconsistent with the fundamental tenets of
Maxwell's theory, however much they may disagree with the acces
sory embellishments with which that theory is occasionally adorned.
There may be a volume electrification without interfering with the
equation of continuity of an incompressible liquid as long as we
admit the possibility of displacement currents and displacements in
conductors, and       I  see nothing improbable in this.          The ordinary
 equations for the currents in a non-homogeneous solid (or any solid if
 inequalities of temperature are taken into account) give a volume
 electrification which can only be destroyed by the introduction of
 a quantity which is analogous to hydrostatic pressure, and the sole
 purpose of which is to destroy all electrifications except at the surface
 of bodies. We know of no physical phenomena which can justify the
 introduction of such a quantity, which seems to me unnecessary.             The
 existence of    a  volume electrification can be shown to exist when a
 current passes from one liquid to another floating on its surface.
 Chemical effects are observed in the region in which the liquids
  begin to mix, and these can be explained by the electrification which
 accompanies each change in electric conductivity.             Maxwell's equa
  tions assume conductors to be homogeneous throughout ; whenever
  we are dealing with average effects only, this assumption is justified.
 We deduce, in a similar way, the equations which represent the
  transmission of light by assuming that each transparent body is
  replaced by a homogeneous medium having certain properties.                But
  although this simplification is allowable in discussing some of the
  phenomena, there are others in which it becomes necessary to go a
  step further, and, considering the structural constitution of the body,
  to take into account separately the effects of the medium separating
  the atoms, and the effects of the atoms themselves.            In all branches
  of physics we are gradually       forced   by the  advance   of  knowledge to
  abandon the assumption of homogeneousness, and if that is done,
  no further difficulty stands in the way of bodily electrifications ; for

               The Discharge   of Electricity through  Gases.         559
we may take them to be really only surface electrifications between the
atoms and the medium.
   I  have offended  in another manner against so-called modern views
of electricity, for  I have spoken of positive and negative electricity
as real substances possessing a separate existence.      I have tried to
place myself, however, under the shelter of recognised authority by
quoting at the top of this lecture Helmholtz's saying that we have as
much ground for the supposition that electricity has an atomic con
stitution as we have for the atomic constitution of matter.     We must
trust to the future to bring this view into harmony with the electro
magnetic theory of light, which may be accepted now as an established
fact.   There is no real antagonism between the two views.     If ever we
are able to explain chemical and gravitational attraction by the
stresses in a medium, we shall still find it convenient to speak of
atoms and molecules ; and in the same way the belief in an electric
strain and stress is consistent with a belief in something in the atom
from which the strain proceeds, and which may be taken as the
elementary quantity of electricity.     Even taking the extreme view
that electric stress is due to vortex filaments in the ether, we need
only assume all these filaments to have the same intensity, and some to
end at the surface of atoms, in order to reconcile apparently antago
nistic views.    But there is no need to commit ourselves at present to
any particular ideas. In some electric phenomena we shall find it
most convenient to speak of electric strain and stress (displacement I
think to be a misleading term, which, however, has come too much
into use to be dispensed with) ; in other, and at present more
numerous, cases, we shall still continue the old nomenclature, and
speak of positive and negative electricity as real quantities. The
subject of electro-chemistry is one of primary importance in the pre
sent state of science. The different behaviour of positively and nega
tively electrified particles points, as  I  have tried to explain, to an
unsymmetrical modification of molecular forces by electrification. It
is not sufficient to add geometrically the effects of molecular and elec
trical action, but it is necessary to take account of the interference
between chemical and electrical forces.        The exact nature of this
interference must partly be solved by. chemical investigation, but the
discharges of electricity through gases still promise a rich harvest to
the investigator.
                                Appendix.
   " The Discharge of Electricity from Glowing Metals."             By
                        Arthur Stanton, B.A.
   It has  long been known that certain bodies undergoing chemical
decomposition are capable of discharging electricity through the

560                          Mr. A. Stanton.
surrounding air.         A few desultory experiments were made in
Dr. Schuster's laboratory, during the hot days of summer about two
years ago, as to this discharge when the body was decomposed in the
for^us of a large concave mirror.    The method, depending on excep
tionally brilliant weather, is neoes^arily inconvenient in this country.
Subsequently, during the Long Vacation, I made experiments in the
same direction, and tried to use a piece of hot metal for the supply
of heat to effect dissociation.    These attempts led to an observation
of   the  conditions   under which a hot electrified piece of copper or
iron could retard a charge of electricity at a good red heat.           I
observed    in  my  first experiments that   if a copper soldering  bolt,
heated to full redness by a gas blowpipe, was placed on an insulating
stand and negatively electrified, discharge took place very rapidly,
and occurred so long as the bolt remained visibly red ; that if the
bolt was repeatedly heated in an oxidising flame, and electrified,
 discharge became continuously slower, and that ultimately the copper
was capable of retaining a charge perfectly at a full red heat.        If
the copper bolt, being in the state last described, was allowed to cool
completely, the oxide of copper chipped off, and the metal, on heating
to redness, behaved generally as at the commencement              of the
 experiments.
    An iron bar was found to behave similarly.
    The experiment was afterwards repeated, with the substitution of
 a wire kept hot by a current for the massive bar of metal.
    In the later form of the experiment, the hot body was connected
 to earth, and the discharge of an electrified conductor in the
 neighbourhood observed.        The wire was wound upon a mica frame
 with thick copper terminals, which served to give the frame
 rigidity ; the other electrode of the system consisted of a clean flat
 copper plate, at a distance of 2 or 3 cm. from the frame. The wire
 used varied from 0'3 to 05 mm. in diameter, the length being about
 60 cm.     Both the frame and the flat plate contiguous to it were
 enclosed in a glass or cylinder surrounded by water to keep it cool,
 and provided with tubes for the introduction of gases.
    The following are the results obtained : —
    First, if the conductor contiguous to the wire be positively
 electrified.
    Here the clean copper wire on becoming red-hot rapidly discharges
  the conductor ; when a uniform film of oxide is formed, the discharge
 ceases.
     If the containing vessel be now filled with hydrogen, and the- wire
 again heated, a similar discharge takes place until the oxide film is
 completely reduced ; the condnctor thereafter retains its charge
 perfectly.
     Secondly, if the conductor be negatively electrified.

          1 he Discharge   of Electricity from Glowing Metals.        561
   In this case, the copper wire must be heated for a longer time in
air before it ceases to effect the discharge, and there is not the same
sharpness of definition between the two states.          The phenomena
observed on heating the now oxidised wire in hydrogen differ also in
this case ; the hot wire not only effects discharge during the
reduction of its oxide coat, but continues to possess this power
certainly for a long time to the same degree.          Hence, a red-hot
copper wire in hydrogen exhibits the curious property of retaining
perfectly a charge of negative electricity, and discharging instantly
a positive electrification.     The hydrogen used was fairly dry, and
free from any sensible taste or smell.
   In dry nitrogen, the results were similar to those obtained with
hydrogen. The gas was carefully dried, and passed for eight or nine
hours over the copper before the electrical tests were made ; the red-
hot copper wire retained a negative charge, but not a positive one.
    The above experiments were all made in Dr. Schuster's laboratory,
and, in fact, under his immediate supervision.          Dr. Schuster has
suggested that they are of sufficient interest to publish in their present
state, because they show more clearly than the experiments with
platinum the nature of the chemical action. In the case of platinum,
there is, of course, the advantage that the metal remains generally in
 the same state, but it is much lessened by the very marked and
 complex effects of surface condensation and occlusion.
    The potential of the bodies used was observed by means of an
 ordinary gold leaf electroscope, and was such as to cause a large
 divergence of the leaves.     In all cases where discharge took place, it
 was  found   easy to cause complete collapse of the leaves.
    It is proposed to supplement this paper with one dealing with the
 phenomena in pure and perfectly dry gas.
