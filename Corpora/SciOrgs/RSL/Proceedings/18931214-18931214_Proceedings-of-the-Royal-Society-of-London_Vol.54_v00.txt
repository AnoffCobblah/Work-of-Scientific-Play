                                  June  1, 1893.
    The   LORD KELVIN, D.C.L., LL.D., President, in           the Chair.
   Professor Alexander Pedler         (elected 1892) was admitted into the

Royal, His Royal Highness was entitled.
   The following Papers were read : —
I. " On the Colours of Sky Light, Sun Light, Cloud Light,
       and Candle Light." By Captain W. de W. Abney, C.B.,
       D.C.L., F.R.S., P.R.A.S. Received May 9, 1893.
   The author has made several comparisons of the above lights
throughout the different parts of their spectra, and has been able to
verify their correctness         by means of templates rotating in the
spectrum      of electric light,  as described in Part II, " Colour Photo
metry," Phil. Trans.,' 1889. It seemed, however, that it would be
           '
useful if the colours of these lights could be expressed in single
wave-lengths, together with the amount of added standard white
light, the latter being expressed in terms of the luminosity of the
dominant colour, in accordance with the method brought before the
Royal Society in 'Proc. Roy. Soc.,' 1891.
    When measuring light from the sky, a beam from the zenith or other
 desired part was reflected throngh a blackened tube into a darkened
 room in which the colour patch apparatus (" Colour Photometry,"
 Abney and Festing, 1886) was placed, and the image of the end of
 the tube was focussed on to the front surface of a cube, the front
 surface of which was coated with ziDC white, its background being
 black velvet.      The patch of colour from the apparatus was also
 thrown on the cube. A rod placed in the paths of the two beams
 enabled the sky light and the spectrum colour to be examined side by
 side.   The slit in the spectrum was an adjustable one, so that any
 intensity of colour within limits would fall on the cube. A beam of

 1893.]        Sun Light, Cloud Light, and Candle Light.               3
 white light reflected from the first surface of the first prism was
 again reflected from the surface of a thin prism on to the cube, a rod
placed in its path cast a shadow on that part illuminated by the sky
light, and by suitable adjustment the boundaries of the two shadows
were caused to exactly coincide.      The colour was thus diluted with
white light, and rotating sectors, described in other papers, being
placed in the path of the white beam, enabled the dilution to be
regulated.
    Sky Light. — On June 27, 1892, at 2.30 p.m., the sky was a good
 blue, but not a dark blue, and perhaps rather milky.       The slit was
moved into the part of the spectrum which appeared to be near the
dominant colour. The colour was diluted to approximately the required
amount.      The slit was shifted and the dilution altered until the two
colours made a perfect match.        It was found that on the standard
scale of the spectrum the dominant colour was represented by 28'6,
which is X 4800. The mean value of the sector aperture was 32°, and
 recollecting that the sectors are double sectors the comparison has to
 be made with 180°.        The next operation was to compare the
 luminosity   of the whole beam  of white light with that of the colour.
 Tbe sectors still remained in the white ; the sky light was cut off,
 and the rod altered till the colour and the white were alongside each
 other with the boundaries of the shadows touching.        The luminosi
 ties of the two were compared, and it was found that the aperture of
 the sector was 14°.    As it required 32° of white to make the dilution
 of the colour, it follows that 32/14, or 2-286, parts of white were
 required to dilute 1 part of the blue.   This may be expressed thus —
                       Sky light =   X 4800 + 2-3 W.
    On July 4, 1892, at mid-day, the same procedure was adopted, and
tbe dominant wave-length was again X 4800. In this case the amount
of added white was thus —
                       Sky light = X4800 + 3-1W;
in other words, the sky was more milky.
    At 4 p.m. on the same day the sky to the east, and about 30° above
the horizon, was evidently slightly greener, and it was found that the
colour agreed with scale No. 29"6, or X 4834, and that it required
3 parts of white to be mixed with it.
                        Skylight = X4834+3W.
    On other days, with the light of the portion of the sky near the
zone of maximum polarisation the dominant wave-length was found
to be between these two limits, and was never found bluer, and the
smallest admixture of white light was found to be 1*9.
                                                              b  2

4      Colours  of Sly Light, Sun Light, Cloud Light,       Sfc.    [June  1,
   From these measures it may be concluded that the dominant colour
of a blue sky is X 4800.
    Amongst artists it is not uncommon to employ cobalt to render
this colour, and in many instances this is mixed with Chinese
white.
    The dominant colour of cobalt was found to be at scale No. 29, or
X4812, when illuminated by ordinary day light, whence it seems
that, as far as colour is concerned, it is singularly fit for the purpose.
    Sun light was compared in the same manner, but the beam was
reflected from the surface of a prism into a dark room, and again
diminished in intensity by placing in its path rotating sectors with
very narrow apertures.
   Near mid-day on July 8 the sun was very clear, the sky being free
from clouds, and a strongish wind blowing from the west.                 Two
separate   sets of  measures   were made   with  an  interval    of   an hour
between each.      It was found that the dominant colour was X4885 in
both cases, and in the first set it was diluted with 5'45 of white, and
in the other with 5'14 of white.         .This indicates that sun light
contains slightly more green-blue rays than the light emitted from
the crater of the positive pole of the electric light. This agrees with
 the spectrum measures made in " Colour Photometry."
    Cloud light was next matched on days in which the sky was over
cast.   A comparison of the general light of the zenith was all that
 was attempted, and near mid-day.
    It was found that it required 1 part of X4864 diluted with 5-5
parts of white to make a match. It will be seen that the dominant
 colour of cloud light lies between that of the sky and of the Sun, as
 might be expected, and is decidedly whiter than the sky, as might
 also be anticipated.
    Various comparisons of sunset colours have been made, and found
 to range from X 6300 up to \ 4800 ; in some cases it was necessary to
 match by means of complementary colours.
    The light from a paraffin candle it was found could be very closely
 matched with D sodium light.        The equation may be expressed as
 follows : —
                      Candle light = X5880 + 0'4W.
    The amount of added white varied from 0-l to O'o, and it is in this
 part of the spectrum that a large number of separate observations are
required in order to get a good and fairly trustworthy mean.

II. "   Flame Spectra at High Temperatures.               Part I. Oxy-
       bydrogen Blowpipe Spectra." By W. N. Hartley, F.R.S.
       Received May 10, 1893.
                                 (Abstract.)
    Brewster, in 1842, first examined the spectra of salts with a flame
of oxygen and coal-gas ('Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin.,' vol. 6, p. 145).
    Professor Norman Lockyer has given us maps of twenty-two
metallic spectra at tbe temperature of the oxygen and coal-gas flame.
The region observed lies between X 7000 and 4000.
    Preparatory to undertaking the study of spectroscopic phenomena
connected with the Bessemer " blow
                                         " and the manufacture of steel
generally,   I have carefully observed the spectra of metals and metallic
oxides obtained by submitting the substances to the oxyhydrogen
flame.
    Method   of Investigation. — The method of obtaining spectra with
 flames at high temperatures is the following.     Hydrogen proceeding
 from a large lead generator is burnt in a blowpipe with compressed
oxygen. Tbe blowpipe measures 3 in. in length by            f in. external
diameter.     The substances examined are supported in the flame on
small plates of kyanite about 2 in. in length, ^V in. in thickness, and
y in. in width.      . This mineral, which is found in masses in Co.
Donegal, contains 96 per cent, of aluminium silicate, and is prac
tically infusible. The spectra were all photographed with the instru
ment employed by me on former occasions for photographing ultra
violet spectra, illustrations of which were published in the ' Chem.
Soc. Journ.,' vol. 41, p. 91, 1882. The dispersion of the instrument
was that of one quartz prism of 60°.
    Isochromatic plates developed with hydroquinone were largely
used.     Various dyes for sensitising and all kinds of developing sub
stances were tried.      The spectra were measured with an ivory scale
divided into hundredths of an inch, and directly applied to the photo
graphs, the division 20 on the scale being made to coincide with the
yellow sodium line which appears in every photograph.              It was
 found convenient to record the measurements on a gelatino-bromide
paper print taken from an enlarged negative. Sometimes, for more
careful and minute reference, it was found convenient to make an
enlargement of the spectrum with the scale in position, but accurate
measurements cannot be made in this way.          It is necessary to use a
low magnifying power and cross wires in the eye-piece.
    For the identification of lines already known nothing more com
plicated is required, but to measure new lines and bands it was con
sidered desirable to make use of a micrometer and microscope, the

 (3               Flame Spectra at High Temperatures.              [June   1,
 screw of the micrometer was cut with 100 threads to the inch, and
  the magnifying power generally used was 10 diameters.
     Characters  and Extent of the Spectra observed. — Just as in the
  ordinary use of the spectroscope we must be prepared to see the lines
  of sodium, and in hydrocarbon flames the bands of carbon, so in these
 spectra the sodium lines and the strongest lines belonging to the
 emission spectrum of water vapour are also always present.
     In addition, the kyanite yields the red line of lithium, which is no
 inconvenience but    a positive advantage, serving, as it does, to indicate
 where the spectra commence.
     A large majority of the metals and their compounds all terminate
 somewhere about the strongest series of water vapour lines. Typical
 non-metallic spectra are sulphur, selenium, and tellurium ; the first
 yields a continuous spectrum with a series of beautiful fluted bands,
 the second a series of fine bands, occurring at closer intervals, and
 the third is characterised by bands still closer together and near the
 more refrangible termination of which four lines occurring in
 Hartley and Adeney's spark spectrum of tellurium are visible. In
 crease in atomic mass causes shorter periods of recurrence of bands.
 In line spectra it is the reverse ; increase in atomic mass causes
 greater periods in the recurrence of lines.    Charcoal and carbon mon
 oxide yield chiefly continuous spectra ; the latter, however, exhibits
 some carbon lines. The hydrocarbons yield the well-known spectrum
 of carbon bands with also those attributed to cyanogen.        Of metallic
 elements, nickel, chromium, and cobalt yield purely line spectra ;
 antimony, bismuth, silver, tin, lead, and gold beautiful banded
spectra (spectra of the 1st order) accompanied by some few lines.
 These spectra are finer than those of selenium and tellurium.
    Iron and copper exhibit lines, and, less prominently, bands.
 Manganese has a beautiful series of bands and a group of three very
closely adjacent lines. Aluminium gives a fine continuous spectrum
with three lines, origin uncertain, zinc a continuous spectrum with
out lines, and cadmium a spectrum consisting of one single line only,
X 32602.
    Of compounds, chromic trioxide yields a continuous spectrum with
six lines belonging to the metal, copper oxide a fine band spectrum,
with two lines of the metal, magnesium sulphate gives a spectrum
of magnesium oxide consisting of broad degraded bands composed of
closely adjacent fine lines and one line belonging to the metal, X 2852.
    The sulphates of calcium, strontium, and barium give both bands
of the oxides and Hues of the elements.           Phosphorus pentoxide
yields   a continuous  spectrum  with  one peculiar line, seen also in the
spectrum of arsenic.
    The chlorides of the alkalis give also lines of the elements with a
more or less continuous spectrum, which, it is believed, is due to

  1893.]             On the  Flow iri Electric Circuits.
 the metal in each case.         Lithium chloride gives no continuous
 spectrum.
     The Volatility of Metals. — One of the most interesting facts ascer
 tained by this investigation is the volatility of all the metals
 examined, except platinum, and particularly the extraordinary
 volatility of manganese, and, to some extent, of the infusible metal
 iridium. Metal believed to be pure iridium is seen to have dimin
 ished after the flame has played upon it for about two hours.
 III.   " On the Flow in Electric Circuits of Measurable Induct
       ance and Capacity; and on the Dissipation of Energy in
        such Circuits."      By Alfred W. Porter, B.Sc, Demon
       strator of Physics in University College, London. Com
       municated by Professor G. Carey Foster, F.R.S. Received
       May 4, 1893.
    The arrangement of the apparatus in the experiments          here de
scribed was as follows : —
    L  is a coil of self -inductance  L (=   0'42 henry) and of resistance
K (=     28 ohms).
    S is a condenser of capacity S (= 5 X 10-6 farads), and in the same
branch with it is an inductionless resistance, r, the value of which can
be varied.
    E is a battery which, when the circuits shown are complete, pro
duces a current through L, and charges the condenser.
    A and B are the two contact pieces of a pendulum interrupter.
The two circuits can be broken at these places by the pendulum : the
time interval between the two ruptures being regulated by the dis
tance between the contact pieces.
    One centimetre distance apart corresponds to 5"270 thousandths of
a second, and, as this distance can be read easily (by a vernier
attached) to a tenth of a millimetre, it is possible to measure inter
vals of
                    5 hundred-thousandths      of a second.
    The method of the experiments is as follows : —

8             Mr. A. W. Porter.             On the Flow in Electric         [June lr
   A  and   B are initially closed;         a steady current, z0, flows in conse
quence    through L,     and the condenser is charged to a difference of
 potential R«o.    The pendnlum breaks contact first at B. This pre
 vents  further flow in the battery branch          ; the coil current is diverted
into the condenser branch, and flows there until its energy is wholly
dissipated or until its flow is intercepted by the rupture at A. The
 charge retained by the condenser is then measured by discharging
it through a D'Arsonval galvanometer (not indicated on the diagram)
 which has been calibrated for ballistic use.
   This series of operations is successively repeated for many values
of the time interval.
   It is thus possible to determine the charge of the condenser at any
moment after the rupture of the battery branch. Some of the results
obtained are shown in fig. 1 and fig. 2.               The ordinates represent the
charges in arbitrary units ; the abscissas give the time in thousandths
of  a second.
   The data for the curves are         as   follows :—

assumption that p is equal to the wire resistance in the circuit
 (28 ohms), the dotted curve in the same figure is obtained.          The
time periods of the two agree very well ; but a marked difference is
seen in the rate of shrinkage of the ordinates.
   The explanation that offered itself is that the wire circuit is not
the only seat of dissipation of energy, but that dissipation also takes
place in the dielectric of the condenser.      In accordance with this, it
is possible to reproduce the experimental curve by increasing the
value of p to 59*43 ohms. Points on the curve so determined are
shown as solid dots in the figure.   The agreement of the time periods
is also improved by this increase in p, as can be seen from the following

     That this latter is only very partially due to eddy currents in the
 iron was shown by repeating the experiment with a brass rod of
     cm. diameter inserted in the coil. The curve obtained is only
 slightly (though distinctly) different from that obtained without
     y core.
     Experiments have also been begun on the decay of current in
        ,ts containing iron and of negligible capacity. The coil possess
 ing the inductance forms one arm of a Wheatstone's bridge. These
 experiments were commenced as far back as June, 1890 ; the experi
 ments described above were commenced in January, 1891.                       Both
 series -were suspended for want of a sufficiently precise interruptor.
 This has since been obtained, and satisfactory work has thus been
 made possible.      The investigation is only in an early stage ; but the
 fact that at least one other observer* is already working in the same
  field induces me to present this preliminary note in order to show the
 independence of our work.

IV. " On    the Motion under Gravity of Fluid Bubbles through
      Vertical Columns of Liquid of a different Density." By
      F. T. TROUTON. Communicated by Professor FITZGERALD,
      F.R.S.    Received May 3, 1893.
    The kind of motion herein referred to can be observed by means
simply of a glass tube, closed at one end, and provided with a stopper.
 If the tube be filled with water to nearly the top, closed, and then
placed upside down, the enclosed bubble of air while ascending to
the top can be observed, and the speed of ascent ascertained between
two measured marks.
    By enclosing different volumes of air it was found that the speed
depended on the length of the bubble.         The relation connecting the
volume of the bubble with its speed of ascent was experimentally
investigated.   The speed, as will be seen from experiments subse
quently described, may be taken within limits as a periodic function
of the volume of the bubble.        Bubbles greater than a certain thing
all have the same velocity.
    Experiments have also been made with other liquids. By mixing
two liquids, such as water and. glycerine, a series of determinations
of speed with liquids of gradually increasing viscosity can be made.
 In these experiments the size of the bubble was outside the periodic
limit. Contrary to expectation it was found that as the viscosity of
water was increased by adding glycerine, the velocity increased
instead of diminished.       With tubes of about Cr7 cm. in diameter, it
is not until the viscosity of the solution used is about eight times
that of water that the velocity comes to be less than that through
pure water. From this state the velocity was found to be inversely
proportional to tlic viscosity of the solution, other things the same.
   Instead of air the bubble may be of some liquid which does not
too readily mix with that of which the column consists.            In this
way experiments were made to investigate the relation between the
speed of ascent and the difference in density of the liquids, and also
whether surface tension may have any influence.
   The consideration of the subject may then conveniently be divided
into two parts. The first part will deal with the dependence of the
speed with which the bubble travels through the liquid column on
the physical properties of the two fluids concerned in the phenomenon.
The second part will refer to the connexion between the size or
volume of the bubble and its speed.

   In   order that the bubble may  descend, the liquid in front has to
 pass up the sides through the     narrow annular space between the
 bubble and the tube. Were the     diameter of the bubble known, the
-question would reduce itself to   a case of viscous flow through an
 annular space — provided we neglected the ends and supposed the walls
 of the bubble to be rigid. The annular width will be seen to depend
 on the surface tension between the liquids, for should the tension
 become very great, say, the bubble must swell out, blocking up the
 tube. This tendency        in part counterbalanced by the excess in
                           is
density of the bubble over that of the liquid column. The case is, so
to speak, then that of viscous flow through an adjustable annular
orifice.
   The pressure per centimetre, or the pressure gradient driving up
the liquid through this annular space, depends simply on the differ
ence in density of the liquids.
  * The   length of the bubble was always several times its diameter,   so as   to get
outside the stage where the velocity depends on the length of bubble.
                                                                                          .

14             Mr. F. T. Trouton.            On the Motion under          [.June 1,
   The surface of the bubble moves by no means in a rigid manner,
as can be seen by watching the movements of little particles of dust
which may be present.          The liquid of the bubble is seen in constant
circulation flowing up the side with the current of glycerine, and
returning down the centre of the bubble.              Thus the viscosity of the
liquid of which the bubble is composed must affect the velocity of its
descent, but in what follows it has been neglected ; this could be done,
because the viscosity of the liquid of the column in most of the
experiments was very great compared with that of the bubble.
   Collecting the various things on which the velocity may depend,
we have : 1, the pressure gradient, that is to say, the difference in
density of the two liquids multiplied by the acceleration of gravity
hg ; 2, the viscosity of the liquids fi ; 3, the surface tension between
the liquids S ; 4, the diameter of the tube D.              It is difficult to see
that anything else could come in to affect the rate of flow unless it be
a slipping over the solid surface.
    Thus we may put
                                  V = /(8<y.SD).
   Assuming the function to have the form
                            V-1 =   2A («*jV*S"D«),*
we can obtain three equations from the considerations of dimensions
to help determine the unknown exponents.
                   From length,f —1 = — 3x          +  y— z + n,
                   From mass,           0   = x+z + m,
                   From time,            1   = —2y — z—2m.
   Now if we suppose y = x, as may very well be done, seeing that the
flow is of a purely viscous nature, we are left with but one unknown,
on account of peculiarities in the coefficients.
                a = l,            to=— (x+l),              n = 2x.
   Thus                   V-1 = 2 A 0*gr*S-<*+,,D»*).
   Since the velocity increases with difference in density of the liquids,
we give x the successive values —1, — 2, —3, &c, and obtain the
velocity expressed in a series.
                                  J
    As there are two coefficients of viscosity to be taken into account,
the series should properly be of the form
             ~  .     ,      ,  ,    A,    ,  A,S   ,   A3S2   , .  1
   • The form of the series represents the reciprocal, instead of the velocity itself,
because it so happened the constants were originally so calculated, and a change
would involve the arithmetical labour over again.
   t The dimensions of c are S = M/L3, of g = L/T;, of yu = M/LT, and of S = M/T*.

of which the column was composed was so much greater than that of
the bubble that the following form proved sufficiently accurate : —

   The value of these constant coefficients could be experimentally
found by a series of determinations of velocity through different

   Taking only three terms of the series, have done this for the case
of air bubbles ascending through columns of glycerine of different
diameters, and I find that the constants thus determined are practically
the same as those required by my experiments with other substances.
Thus three terms would appear to be ample.
   In the following table is exhibited the time taken by a bubble of
air to ascend 1 cm. (the reciprocal of the velocity) through a column

    The difference in density was 1'25, and the surface tension 63 dynes

10° and 14°.        For some sized tubes the agreement between the
observed and the number calculated is not good, but this is probably
due to variations in temperature.             The viscosity of glycerine varies
rapidly  with    temperature.       The   importance      of constant temperature
was not appreciated until most of the experiments made had been
completed.

surface tension.       An examination of the following tables will, I think,

       The agreement with theory is remarkable, considering the great
    range introduced    into the experiments.        The density difference and
    the surface tension vary between themselves nearly 100 times.
       In the accompanying diagram are plotted the various forms the
    equation takes on putting in the values of the physical constants
    proper to each body. , The abscissae represent the diameter of the
    tube in millimetres, and the ordinates the time calculated to be taken
    by the bubble in travelling 1 cm. The times found by experiment
    given in the above tables are marked so far as the-Jimits of the paper
    would allow for the purpose of comparison.
       The case of creasote is instructive. With wide tubes the bubble
   moves comparatively slowly. For when the diameter is large, the
   first term in the series is most important, so that the density is then
   the controlling factor. Bat when D is small, the third term is most
   important, so that if the surface tension is very small, as is so in the
   case of creasote, the babble will move
                                               comparatively quickly.
      In such case the bubble assumes a long, almost needle-like appear
  ance, giving ample room round it for the flow

  the column.     In the case of chloroform, for instance, this long form
  is not assumed because of the higher value of the surface

   Besides the foregoing, experiments were also made in which the
viscosity of the liquid through which the bubble passed was changed
in order to experimentally verify that the velocity varied inversely as
the viscosity in agreement with the theory.
   For this purpose the viscosity of glycerine was gradually reduced by

    It will  be seen from this table that within certain limits we are
justified in assuming the velocity to be inversely as the viscosity, but
 there is a complete failure in the applicability of the law in cases
where the viscosity is small. The retardation observed in such cases
is doubtless due to the formation of eddying motions in the fluid, and,
indeed, if any small motes, which happen to be present be watched,
considerable commotions are always to be seen as the bubble passes
 whenever there is this retardation.
    The retardation is even more marked in the case of air bubbles, for
as will be seen from the following table, not only are the observed
 values greater than the calculated values, but they are actually greater
 than values observed with greater viscosities, i.e., than those given
 higher np the list. Diameter of tube = 0'665 c.c.
    This retardation is better shown in Diagram 2, which is plotted
 from a number of careful observations.             The maximum velocity with
 this sized  tube   corresponds    to   about   33    per cent, of glycerine, the
 velocity of which is about three times that of water at the tempera
 ture of the experiments. The abscissae represent the percentage com
 position of the solutions, beginning on the left with glycerine. The
 ordinates are the corresponding velocities.

    The form of the curve was found to be the same with solutions in
water of sugar, of calcium chloride, or of sodium hydrate.
    The actual turning down of the curve of velocities at small values
of the viscosity, as occurs in these cases, would apparently be a
matter of the rate of departure from each Other of the critical velocity
curve and that calculated from the theory of viscous flow, which
latter,    must be remembered, depends on the surface tension and
           it

an important bearing in this particular question.        By employing, say,

velocity is probably due to the great diminution of the surface tension,
 which for the 5 per cent, solution was less than half that of water.
    In connexion with this, as it probably depends on the formation
of soap, must be mentioned a rather pretty experiment, which is
 easily made. A bubble of sweet oil if allowed to ascend a tube (say,
 of diameter = 1) of ordinary pure water passes up in the ordinary
 way.    But, if the tube contains a weak solution of caustic soda, as
the bubble ascends, the motion of the solution over the surface of the
oil raises a series of circular waves round the cylindrical bubble, or,
rather, a series of surface tension ripples. The waves almost invari
ably join at once to form one continuous spiral wave round the
 bubble, which then lends a surprisingly life-like appearance to the
bubble as it wriggles its way upwards through the tube.*
    The system of circular waves is evidently unstable, since the
formation of the spiral means the opening of a continuous channel
for the flow past of the solution.
   -The sign of the spiral (right- or left-handed) depends on initial
circumstances, and can, when the tube is held in the hand, be con
ditioned at will by a judicious turn of the wrist.
    The solution must be very weak, best about 1 part of strong caustic
 soda in 50,000 parts water ; much stronger than this has too great a
tendency to emnlsify the oil, doubtless itself a phenomenon in part
arising from diminution in surface tension on the more exposed parts
of the oil.
    When the liquid of which the column is composed is very viscous,
the system of waves is prevented from forming, as is the case with
a creasote bubble passing through glycerine, despite the fact of the
 surface tension being so very small.
    At first sight it might     appear that the ascent of bubbles through
tubes of different liquids would prove a convenient method for com
paring their viscosities.       As has been seen, it is necessary, among
other things, to know the surface tension in each case.               This renders
the comparison        of viscosity in this way really a more troublesome
process than by ordinary methods, since the determination of surface
tension, especially if the liquids be viscous, is often accompanied by
considerable uncertainty, owing to a persistent tendency to stick to
glass frequently exhibited.           This is particularly so in finding the
surface tension between two liquids.
    The phenomenon, however, would appear to be suited for the
comparison      of the surface tension between liquids. If the same
liquid  constitute    the column in each case, it need not be necessary to
know its viscosity, only the density being requisite.
   * On inclining the tube, especially with smaller sized tubes, the bubble is seen to
have quite a caterpillar mode of progression.

   In this way   the surface tension    between two liquids, even though
they dissolve each other in  all proportions, may be measured.       Thus,
a  bubble of water can be got to ascend a tube of glycerine, preserv
ing for a considerable distance its perfectly distinct shape. In this
          I
fashion have found 6-5 dynes per cent, for the initial value of the sur
face tension between water and glycerine. The velocity of the bubble
rapidly increases as it proceeds, owing to the surface tension dimin
ishing according as glycerine dissolves in the water.      The continuous
replacement of one of the liquids in the method gives it an advantage
for sucb a purpose as this over any statical method.          The quantity
here discussed would in all likelihood prove to be related to molecular
rates of diffusion, and perhaps should for this reason merit consider
ation.
   An important point, which up to this has not been touched upon,
is the necessity for the liquid of which the bubble is composed not
to adhere so tenaciously to the walls of the tube as to cause the
bubble   to retain the shape shown in fig. 2 in section.       This cannot
                                   Fig.  2.
happen when the resolved component parallel to the axis of the tube
of the tension of the surface between the liquids plus the tension
at the surface of separation of the bubble and tube exceeds that
between the second liquid and tube.         Even though this bo not the
case, the bubble will often assume the shape with convex ends suit
able for travelling through the tube.
    With every substance, as the diameter of the column is reduced, a
 stage is reached when there is a tendency to stick even though the
end be convex.
    This limit is found to depend largely on the surface tension ; with
high values of surface tension it is soon reached.         For instance, a
 bubble of mercury sticks hopelessly in a tube of glycerine of
 diameter 0"31, while creasote travels freely, although the pressure
 driving it is 62 times less. Now the surface tension in the case of
 mercury is 180 times that of the creasote used in these experiments.
    No quantitative determinations have been made on the remaining

experimentally unverified factor in our expression for the velocity of
the bubble.      That is to say to verify the terms under which the
acceleration (g) appears in the expression.        This, were it desirable,
might of course be investigated by an arrangement utilising centri
fugal force, but without elaborate arrangements it is not difficult to
observe the great influence increase in pressure produced by swing
ing a tube round and round by hand has. To take an example, a
bubble of creasote in a tube of glycerine of diameter = 0"31 takes
over 13 hours to travel 1 m. By swinging it round and round in the
hand, one can get it through in less than as many minutes.
   In connection with this the comparative ease with which a stray
liquid bubble in the tube of a thermometer can be brought home by
swinging in the hand will suggest itself.
                                  Part II.
   "When the length of the bubble is less than a certain thing, the
velocity is found to be very different for different sized bubbles.    The
result of some experiments made with different sized bubbles of air
passed up through a tube of water of diameter 0'665 is exhibited in
Diagram III.
   The ordinates represent the velocity and the abscissae the volume
of the bubble measured in terms of the length of tube it occupies
when at rest.     The length of the bubble in motion is always of course
greater than this.
   It will be seen that the velocity corresponding to a volume of about
7 is nearly double that at about 5'5.      The phenomenon is, doubtless.

due to the form taken     by the bubble.         The figures on the diagram
roughly represent    the appearance     of the bubble corresponding to the
different points where they are placed.         The small bubble on the left
passes   up rapidly.    As larger volumes of air are taken to form the
bubble the velocity falls to a minimum, at which point the bubble is
almost spherical in shape.         With further additions of air, the
spherical form gives way to one pointed at top. Again more air
swells out the top and gives the bubble a somewhat dumb-bell
appearance.      For this and the spherical form the velocity is a
minimum.       In these instances the ratio of the resistance of the
annular channel to the flow-past of the liquid compared to the
driving pressure is a maximum.              The intermediate shape being
pointed at top gains an increased pressure head without a corre
sponding increase in resistance.        The various forms assumed by the
bubbles remind one of the well-known initial shapes taken on the
formation of liquid drops.
   Similar curves were obtained with other sized tabes, the phe
nomenon being rather more marked in the case of the smaller sizes.
Other liqnids were found to behave in a like way when used either
as the substance of the column or for constituting the bubble itself.
   The curve in the diagram exhibits the general behaviour of the
hubbies, but occasionally an anomalous determination of velocity will
be obtained ; this is accompanied          by the bubble having also an
anomalous form.       That is to say, a volume of air a little in excess of
that corresponding to the spherical stage, instead of assuming a
pointed form at top, will retain a spherical form, and as a consequence
will travel very slowly.

ordered for them.
   Pursuant to the notice given at the last meeting of the Society,
the President proposed and the Senior Secretary seconded H.R.H. the

I. " Preliminary Report of the Joint Solar Eclipse Committee
      of the Royal Society, the Royal Astronomical Society, and
      the Solar Physics Committee on the Observations of the
      Solar Eclipse of April 16, 1893." By A. A. Common.
      F.R.S. Received June 7, 1893.
   The Joint Committee have requested me to make the following
brief report on the observations of the Eclipse. This will be followed
shortly by a more complete report.
   The Joint Committee was formed early in 1892, a grant of money
was obtained from the Government Grant Fund of the Royal Society,
and preparations were at once begun. After due consideration, it
was decided to send out two observing expeditions, one to Fundium,
on the Salum River, in Senegambia, and one to Para-Curu, in the
Province of Ceara, in the northern part of Brazil. With the exception
of the work undertaken by Professor Thorpe, the whole of the
observations were photographic.     Three classes of work were under
taken at each station.
   1st. Photographs of the corona, in continuation of a long and very
complete series already taken with the
                                            "       " lens, and similar

 1893.]       Report  of  die Joint Solar Eclipse  Committee.         29
photographs, on three times the scale, by means of a negative en
larging lens by Dallmeyer.
   2nd. Photographs of the surroundings of the Sun by means of a
prism in front of the object glass (prismatic camera).
   3rd. Photographs of the spectrum of the corona by slit spectro
scopes.
   The West African Expedition was placed in charge of Professor
Thorpe, F.R.S.      Professor Thorpe, assisted by Mr. Gray and Mr.
Forbes, undertook the determination of the photometric intensity of
the coronal light on the method he used at the Solar Eclipse of 188G,
at Granada.      A complete and satisfactory number of observations
were made.
   Mr. A. Fowler undertook the prismatic camera observations, using
a 6-in. telescope, lent by Mr. Lockyer, with a large prism in front of
the object glass.   Mr. Fowler took six plates before and after totality,
and fifteen during totality.     The photographs are considered by Mr.
Lockyer, at whose wish this investigation was made, to be of very
great value.                      ,
   Sergeant    Kearney,   R.E.,  had  charge of the coronagraph.   With
the Abney and Dallmeyer lenses and a double camera, eleven pictures
of the corona were secured, and these are of a most satisfactory
character.
   Captain E. S. Hills, R.E., undertook the slit spectroscopes, and
obtained two excellent photographs.
   Mr. A. Taylor and Mr. Shackleton formed the expedition to
Brazil.    The coronagraph was placed in the charge of Mr. Taylor, as
well as the slit spectroscopes, to be used if the necessary local help
could be obtained.       Twelve photographs of the solar corona were
obtained, of a similar character to those obtained in Africa, and
directly comparable with them as regards exposure, density, and
detail of the coronal structure. Most of these coronal plates have
Captain Abney's density squares impressed on them for determining
the density of the photographic image.         Two photographs with the
slit spectroscopes   were  obtained.
   Mr. Shackleton, with an arrangement somewhat similar to that
 employed by Mr. Fowler, took a large number of photographs ; these
are only less valuable than the African photographs in that the
instrument employed was on a smaller scale.
   The air at Fundium was hazy.           At Para-Curu the observations
were made    under   peculiarly  fortunate circumstances, as the Sun was
clear of clouds only for a short time about the time of the Eclipse.
   Generally speaking, the results obtained are of a most satisfactory
character. The photographs taken at each station provide a large
amount of material to work upon, particularly those by the prismatic
camera.     From the distance apart of the two stations and the dupli

 cation of the work, a comparison may throw some light on the
 question of change of form and nature of the surroundings of the Sun
 during the interval between the observations. In this respect we may
 have the photographs taken in Chili to further extend this time
 interval.
     The various members of the expeditions have enjoyed good health,
 and no one seems to have suffered injury from the excessive heat.
    The Committee are under great obligations for much assistance
 given to the expeditions.       The work of observation in Africa was
 made on French territory.       The French Government did everything
 possible in granting a choice of sites, and M. Victor Allys, the
 French Administrator at Fundinm, gave most valuable help.
    The Admiralty have given us a gunboat to take the party up the
 Salum River and attend on them during the time this work lasted,
 and a cruiser brought the party from Bathurst to Grand Canary.
 The value of the help afforded by the Admiralty can be appreciated
 when it is known that without it this expedition could not have been
 sent.
     From many other quarters most valuable aid has been received,
 and will be more fully acknowledged in the General Report.
 II. "  On the Bright Bands in the present Spectrum of Nova
       Auriga?." By William Huggins, D.C.L., L.L.D., F.R.S.,
       and Mrs. Huggins.       Received May 29, 1893.
    Some   few prefatory words are called for in explanation of the
 partial incompleteness of the present, communication.
    A considerable brightening, from below the 14th magnitude to
above the 10th magnitude, was found to have taken place in the
Nova when it was re-observed' in the early part of August, 1892,
and to be accompanied by a modification of its spectrum, apparently
analogous to a similar change in the spectrum of Nova Cygni in
1877, since the observations we made of the star on March 24, 1892,
when it had fallen to nearly the 11th magnitude.*
    In consequence, however, of the removal of the eye-end of the
telescope to the workshops of Messrs. Tronghton and Simms for the
attachment to it of the mounting for a fine Rowland grating by
Mr. Brashear, we were without the means of observing the star and
its spectrum during the whole of the autumn and the early winter.
It was not until the beginning of the year that the new spectroscope
was mounted in our observatory, and then, from some instrumental
causes of delay and from a prevalence of bad weather, we were

  1893.]     Bands in the present Spectrum of Nova Auriga.             31
  not able   to observe the spectrum    of the Nova until the night of
  February 1.
     Before this time the altered appearance of the spectrum of the
 .Nova had been observed at several observatories, and its spectrum
  had been described as consisting mainly, in the visible region, of a
  bright line in the orange, of the two nebular lines, and of the hydro
 gen line at F.
    As soon as we directed the spectroscope to the star, we saw at once,
 even with one prism, that the two principal bright bands which had
 been described as the
                          " nebular lines " were, in strong contrast with
 these, not single lines but broad bright spaces, diffused at the ends
 and irregularly bright, which we suspected to be groups of bright
 lines.
    On February 8 we observed these bright spaces with the 4-inch
 grating of 14,438 lines to the inch, using the spectrum of the second
 order. The collimator and the telescope have each an aperture of
 2 inches, and the spectrum was viewed under a magnifying power of
 23 diameters.     Our suspicion was then confirmed, the bands being
 clearly resolved into groups of bright lines upon a feebly luminous
 background.
    On February 26, micrometric measures were begun of the positions
 of the constituent lines of the groups, when unfortunately we dis
 covered that in consequence of flexure in one part of the instrument,
 a shifting of the micrometer webs relatively to the lines of the
 spectrum was liable to take place, and so make the measures uncer
 tain to about as much as 2 tenth-metres when the spectrum of the
 second order was in use.
    The cause of the want of rigidity of the instrument in this respect
 made it necessary that the spectroscope should go back to Messrs.
 Troughton and Simms' workshops ; and then, from unavoidable
 Jflays and the coming in of the Easter holidays, it was not until the
 second week in April that the spectroscope was again in position for
 use ; but by this time the Nova was too far past the meridian for
 satisfactory observations to be made upon its spectrum.
    Our opportunities of working upon the spectrum of the star were
 thus absolutely restricted to the few fine nights between February 1
and February 26 ; and, further, our observations of the positions of
the lines are, for the reason we have mentioned, affected with a
possibility of error which may be as great as 2 tenth-metres, though
it is probable that the positions given in the diagram are not actually
in error to as much as half that amount.
    For the same reason the resolution of the minor features of the
groups has not been worked out with the completeness which was
well within our instrumental means, if the number of fine nights had
not been so limited, for on some of the nights on which observations

 between the 9th and 10th magnitude.
     Still, notwithstanding the comparatively incomplete            state of our
 observations,     which we greatly regret, we do not hesitate to consider
 them of sufficient importance, bearing as they do upon so remarkable
 a phenomenon as would be the change of a star into a nebula, to
 justify us in communicating them to the Royal Society.
     The spectroscope is provided with a -1-inch Rowland grating by
 Brashear, and a prism of dense flint of 27°, silvered on one face,
 which can take the place of the grating in the grating box.
    As we have already stated, the observation of the Nova with this
 prism showed the bright lines
                              "       " broad and
                                                       irregularly bright, and
 raised the suspicion in our minds that they were probably groups.
 They were observed more or less successfully with the grating,
 usually with an eye-piece magnifying 23 diameters, on February 8,
 10, 11, 16, 17, and 26.
    1.  Brighter Group near   the  Position of  the Principal Nebular Line.
    The separate results of our more favourable observations of this
 group on the different nights are put together in the accompanying
 diagram. In addition, however, to the details drawn in the diagram,
 at several very favourable moments of seeing, we had distinct and
 undoubted glimpses of finer lines in the spaces between the brighter
ones, of which some only are given in the diagram.              For this reason
 the diagram must be regarded as an incomplete representation of the
group, though showing accurately its main features and general
character.
    The group,       as shown  in the diagram, extends through a little
more than 15 tenth-metres,        and consists of lines more or less bright
upon a feebly luminous background, which can be traced to some
distance beyond the lines at both ends of the group.                   The more
prominent features are : two lines, the brightest in the group and
about equally bright — but the more refrangible one rather the

brighter — which form the termination of the group towards the blue ;
a line nearly as bright about the middle of the group ; and a third
prominent line at the end of the group towards the red.
    We have little doubt, though we hesitate to state it positively, that
the space between the two brightest lines, that on the blue side of
the bright line in the middle of the group, and the spaces on the blue
sides of some others of the lines, were darker than the faint luminous
background, in which case we should have to do possibly with lines
of absorption of the same substances shifted towards the blue.                      A
few only of the finer bright lines which were occasionally glimpsed
between the more brilliant lines have been put into the diagram.
    The pair of bright lines at the termination of the group towards
the blue makes this the brighter end of the group, which does not,
however, as a whole possess any of the usual featnres of a fluting.
    On Febrnary 10, the micrometer webs were placed so as just to
include the bright lines of the group, but not the faint background
which at the clearest moments could be traced for some distance,
especially at the blue end of the group. The instrument remained
untouched, and the position given in the diagram is that found from
the places of the micrometer webs upon the solar spectrum, on Row
 land's scale, as observed on the following morning.
     On the 26th measures of this group were made relatively to the
 position of the principal line in the nebula of Orion ; these gave also
 almost exactly the same position in the spectrum for the group, but,
 as we have already stated, all these measures are unfortunately
 liable to a small error from the possible flexure, at that time, of a
  part of the instrument.
     The mean of Mr. Campbell's measures at the Lick Observatory,
 during the period of our observations, from February 10 to Feb
  ruary 27, gives X 5006 for the middle of the band. He remarks :
  " In any discussion of these observations it is necessary to take into
 account the difficulty of accurately locating the centre of a line so
  broad and diffuse as this one is."*
      In another place Mr. Campbell says : " The line is at least 8 tenth-
  metres broad and the edges very difluse."t
      These observations would be brought into accordance with our own,
  so far as relates to the length and the position of the band, if we sup
  pose Mr. Campbell to have observed only the more refrangible and
  much brighter half of the whole group.              J

34              Dr. and Mrs. Huggins.             On  the  Bright [June 8,
   The probable analogy between the Nova and the remarkable
variable star ft Lyrae, in the spectrum of which also we have to do
apparently with bright and dark lines of the same substances, though
not in all cases identical with those of the Nova, in motion re
latively to each other, which we ventured to point out in our former
communication on the Nova,* has been recently greatly strengthened
by the photographic observations of ft Lyras at different stages of
its periodic variations by Dr. B61opolsky at the Observatory of
Pulkova.
    In some of his photographs, especially in one taken shortly after
the star's second maximum, bright lines come out near the positions
of the bright groups of the Nova which are now under discussion.
As the scale of Dr. Belopolsky's photographs is much smaller than
that of our diagram, we felt some hesitation in attempting any
 identification of his lines with those of the Nova. At our request,
 Dr. Belopolsky has been so kind as to put into our diagram the
 two brightest of the lines of ft Lyras, as they appeared shortly after
 a second maximum, which fall within the brightest group of the Nova,
 and which, indeed, may be identical with two of the lines in the Nova.
 It may, however, be thought that the lines of ft Lyras suggest that
 they are independent bright lines rather than members of a group
such as that of the Nova.
    Whatever may ultimately be found to be the truth, there can be
no question as to the probable high significance of the remarkable
 analogy which exists between the changes which take place in
ft Lyrae and those which have been observed in Nova Aurig».
    The two other spectra in the diagram represent respectively the
position and character of the two nebular lines, and the position of
the bright double or multiple band which was so brilliant in this
region of the Nova in the beginning of last year.
      2. Bright Group near the Position of the Second Nebular Line.
    Not anticipating that our opportunities of observing were to be     so
soon cut off, we gave our attention chiefly to the brighter group, in
tending, after we had completed our observations and measures of
it, to attack seriously the second group.
    However, on nearly all the nights we observed we gave some
attention to this group, which, from being fainter, is more difficult
to resolve, though on the clearer nights it was fairly well seen with
the grating.
    Generally, the group may be described as of the same order as the
brighter one, consisting of bright lines and possibly of some absorp
tion lines upon a feebly illuminated background.

   "We   have endeavoured to represent in the diagram as truthfully
as we can    the best views we obtained of this group ; but during one or
two exceptional moments of good seeing we thought that we glimpsed
finer bright lines in the spaces between.     Indeed, the group may con
sist of a close grouping of bright lines.
   For the same reasons, fewer measures were attempted of this group,
and its position was less accurately determined, but neither the con
stitution of the group as represented in the diagram nor its position
can, we think, be much in error.
   We were also unable to work upon the bright line in the orange,
and to do more than satisfy ourselves, by a direct comparison, that
the line about F was really the hydrogen line in that region.
                            General Conclusions.
   It need scarcely be said that no contrast could well be more striking
than that which these extended groups of lines form with the two
narrow and defined lines in the spectrum of the Great Nebula in Orion.
   It is difficult to suppose that we have to do with the same substance
or substances, whatever they may be, which produce the nebular lines,
even if we imagine very different conditions of temperature, or even
allotropic conditions.
   In the laboratory, allotropic changes are not usually accompanied
by new groups, or lines at the positions of the characteristic lines of
the snbstances in their original state.
   We wish to speak at present with great reserve, as our knowledge
of the Nova is very incomplete, but we do not regard the circumstance
that the two groups of lines above described fall near the positions of
the two principal nebular lines as sufficient to show any connexion
between the present physical state of the Nova and that of a nebula
of the class which gives these lines.
   Influenced by the analogy between some of the changes in the
spectrum of the Nova and those which are associated in the spectrum
of p Lyrae with the variation of its light, and also by other reasons
which we pointed out in our former communication, we are still
strongly inclined to take the same view which we there ventured to
suggest, namely, that in the outburst of the Nova we have not to do
mainly with cold matter raised suddenly to a high temperature by a
collision of any form but rather, for the most part, as was suggested
by Dr. Miller and myself in 1866 in the case of the first temporary
star examined with the spectroscope, with an outburst of existing
hot matter from the interior of the star or Btars ; indeed, with phe
nomena broadly similar to, but on an immensely grander scale than
those with which we are familiar in the periodic greater and lesser
disturbances of the Sun's surface.

    Such grand eruptions may well be expected to take place as stars
 cool, and if in two or more dull and comparatively cool stars such a
 state of things were imminent, then the tidal action due to their
 near approach might be amply adequate to determine, as by a trigger
 action, such eruptions.
    Under such conditions, fluctuations of brightness and subsequent,
 partial renewals of the eruptive disturbances might well take
 place.
 III. " The Process of Secretion in the Skin of the Common Eel."
       By E. Waymouth Reud, Professor of Physiology in Uni
       versity College, Dundee.         Communicated by Professor
       M.  Foster,  Sec. R.S.    Received    April 18, 1893.
                               (Abstract.)
    Leydig, more than forty years ago, demonstrated the possibility of
a secretory process in the skins of Fish by the discovery in the
epidermis of some twelve genera, of specialised cells to which the name
of " schleimzellen "was given. Since then Kolliker, Max Schultze, F. E.
Schulze, Foettinger, List, Leydig himself, and others have extended
our knowledge of the anatomical secreting elements of the epidermis,
and shown that in many instances it is extremely probable that
several varieties of such structures exist. Of the several forms of
glandular elements, the goblet cell is the most widely spread, and its
epidermic origin and development has been most carefully investi
gated by F. E. Schulze and List.       Considerable difference of opinion
has, however, arisen regarding the function of another form of special
                                                    "
ised epidermic cell, viz., the club cell (" kolben    of Max Schultze),
which was originally described by Kolliker for Myxine and Peiro-
myzon, though F. E. Schulze found that such cells also occurred in
Tinea, Leuciscus, Cobitis, Esox, Silurus, and Anguilla, and Fritsch in
Malapterurus.    Kolliker himself, in Myxine, recognised the relation
ship of these cells to the thread cells of the mucous sacs, first clearly
described by Johannes Miiller. Max Schultze, however, deemed them
to be of the nature of nervous end organs, possibly contractile, on
account of certain appearances in polarised light recalling those of
striated muscle fibre.    H. Miiller, F. E. Schulze, Foettinger, Leydig,
and Fritsch, finding that these club cells are not constantly found in
contact with the corium, as Max Schultze thought, have all inclined
towards considering a secretory function probable for these struc
tures, but have given no very definite information as to its details.
Quite recently Pogojeff has again upheld Max Schultze's nerve end
organ theory in the case of Petromyzon.

 1893.]         Secretion in the  Skin of the Common Eel.                37
    Convinced that much of the variation in description of the appear
ances of the secretory elements, and of the club cells in particular,
 had arisen from the fact that no special care seems to have been
 taken by any of the above observers to note the condition of the skin
as regards secretory activity at the time of fixation for histological
work,    I have paid special attention to the condition of my fish, and
have also resorted to artificial methods of excitation.
    The Eel possesses both goblet cells and club cells in its epidermis,
and is therefore suitable for the study of the process of secretion in
both of these elements.
    To obtain skins in the lowest phase of secretory activity, hybern-
ating fish were obtained, rendered motionless by a successful trans
 fixion of the medulla, and the skin immediately removed before the
condition of " shock
                        " had
                              passed off, and therefore without any reflex
movement and concomitant secretory action. Such skins are termed
"
   normal."    To obtain skins in the highest phase of secretory action,
 the headless or intact fish (usually caught in summer) was either
exposed to the action of the vapour of chloroform, which acts at first
as a powerful     stimulant, subjected to faradisation, or allowed to
writhe and slime in the manner common to Eels. Skins from such
fish are designated "stimulated."
    An examination of the slime of an Eel reveals the following histo
logical elements : —
    Fibres from 2 /t in breadth to the finest fibrils, inexcitable by
electricity, indigestible by acid pepsin or alkaline trypsin, giving the
xanthoproteic reaction, and staining brilliant yellow with picro-
carmine.     They are probably chemically of the nature of keratin.
These fibres resemble in microscopic appearance those of the slime
of Myxine, and from Eels placed in baths of pilocarpine solution aro
often obtained in convoluted masses.
    Granules from 0#5 fi to 0'75 /* in diameter, soluble in 5 per cent,
acetic acid, giving the xanthoproteic reaction, swelling, but not dis
solving, in dilnte alkali, resisting peptic and tryptic digestion, and
staining red with picrocarmine.
    Nuclei from 2 p. to 4-5 /i in diameter.
    Epidermic cells, and occasionally extruded goblet cells.
    In addition, mucin is present in the slime, seeing that the aqueous
extract boiled for several hours with 2 per cent, sulphuric acid yields
a substance capable of reducing Fehling's fluid, and is moreover pre
cipitated by acetic acid. The acetic acid precipitate, however, being
partly soluble in excess of acetic acid, and leaving an insoluble
residue after digestion with pepsin and hydrochloric acid, it is prob
able -that nncleo-albumin may also be present, though sufficient
material for a phosphorus analysis was not collected.

   The club cells arise from the cells of the palisade layer by amitotic
division. Around the nucleus of the young cell a granular modifica
tion of the protoplasm occurs, which is the forerunner of the forma
tion of a vesicle which always bears a distinct relation to the nucleus
in its origin. The contents of the vesicle, at first homogeneous,
become granular, and a lattice work of the surrounding protoplasm
forms a distinct wall.     In staining reaction the contents of this
vesicle differ markedly from those of the goblet cells described below.
•They refuse to give the red-violet reaction with thionin, considered
by Hoyer as characteristic of mucin, stain well with soluble blue,
alone of all the dyes used, except that in sublimate specimens they
take the methyl green of the Biondi stain in contradistinction to the
body of the club cell which takes the acid fuchsin.

the former giving rise to the granules and nuclei of the slime, and
the latter becoming further broken up to supply the fibres.
   In the elimination of the elements derived from the club cells the
surface epidermis    is    lifted, and the spiral formation of the fibre
masses appears to aid in this act.

the palisade cells.     They are pushed to the surface by the supply of
ordinary epidermic cells originating below.          The young cells, with
closed theca in the lower layers, contain distinct granules in osmic
vapour or Flemming's fluid material, giving the red-violet reaction
with thionin and staining well with most basic dyes. There            is   no
evidence of List's    "  filar and inter-filar mass," except in those cells
which have nearly reached the surface, and whose contents are prob
ably altered by imbibition. A process of regeneration of goblet cells
near the surface appears to occur, for after the discharge of the first
load of mucigen the protoplasmic foot remaining in the epidermis
grows, and develops the red-violet thionin reaction never present in
the' fully developed goblet, except in the contents of the theca.

1893.]            Secretion in the Skin of  the Common   Eel.            39
     Fibroblasts. — Among the cells of the lower layers of the epidermis
are found small cells 4 to 5 fi in diameter resembling lymphocytes,
generally in little masses, and with nuclei often presenting mitotic
figures. Such cells have been described by Langerhans in Petramyzon
Planeri, List in Cobitis,        and Fritsch in Malapterurus.     List has
described them as wandering colls passing in from the corium, and
considers that they are finally extruded in degenerated form, as
Stohr has demonstrated in the case of the tonsil. Fritsch saw no
evidence of this extra-epidermic origin in Malapterurus, and came to
the conclusion that these cells supply the surface epidermic scales.
In the Eel these cells are undoubtedly in their origin foreign to the
epidermis, and can be traced from the blood vessels of the corium
through the basement membrane.            In the epidermis itself all forms
can be traced between the lymphocyte-like cell (fibroblast) and con
 nective tissue cells with fine processes, which abound especially in the
 lower layers.        Leydig has already demonstrated that connective
 tissue cells other than chromatophores may exist between the epider
 mic elements of Fish (Cyprinus carassius), and it is interesting to
 note that Langerhan6, who first described these '' kleine Rundzellen,"
 was of opinion that they represented contracted chromatophore-like
 cells devoid of pigment. It is easy to demonstrate a complete net
 work of connective tissue in the epidermis by sections parallel to the
 surface, especially in cases where the bodies of the club cells have
  become shrunken, and its function appears to be to hold together a
  tissue which, on account of the peculiar processes involved in secre
  tion, would otherwise be of very labile nature.
      The process of secretion, therefore, so far as it can be deduced
  from the appearances in the epidermis of slowly secreting winter
  Eels, appears to be as follows : —
      Goblet cells, the direct descendants of palisade cells, are gradually
  forced to the surface by young epidermic cells derived from the
  same source.      On nearing the surface these swell, probably by imbibi
  tion of water, and, a stoma forming in the theca, the contents are
  discharged, the remainder of the cell not necessarily being at once
  extruded, but capable of undergoing regeneration. The club cells from
  the same origin end in (i) a spirally wound fibre mass, which, after
                                              "
  probably helping, by a kind of " elater action, to remove the surface,
   is discharged and breaks up into the slime fibres ; and in (ii) a mass
  of granular material inclosing the original nucleus, also discharged,
   and giving rise to the granules and nuclei of the slime.
      Histology of Artificially Stimulated Epidermis. — The details of the

layers.     This result, so far   as concerns   the club cells," is of reflex
origin, for chloroform vaponr applied to the exsected skin does not
produce the effect.     There is, then, physiological evidence of a con
nexion between the club cells and the central nervous system,
          I
though have been unable to obtain convincing proof of actual nerve
fibrils by the use of gold.     The surface of the epidermis may be com
pletely thrown off by the rapid production and uncoiling of the
" fibre masses " of the club cells. At the same time a
                                                              rapid passage
of fibroblasts into the epidermis takes place, probably with a view to
affording support to the epidermic elements during the subsequent
regenerative processes that must occur.          This inroad of fibroblasts
may be so great, and the secretory activity so violent, that, under
such circumstances,       whole masses may be extruded still in the
elementary lymphocytic form.
   The action of faradisation is less violent, but, not being followed
by any narcotic action upon the elements, may be employed to obtain
a picture of the result of prolonged stimulation.          In such experi
ments the epidermis is found bereft of superficial cells, and its
surface covered by a ntass of extruded club cells and fibre masses,
if the stimulation has been carried out in air. Dividing nuclei in
both the palisade cells and ordinary epidermic cells are far more
frequent than normal, and, as before, the number of fibroblasts is
excessive.
   By poisoning Eels with atropine a condition of the epidermis is
found in which the club cells go through their metamorphosis while
still in contact with the corium, the surface epidermis is intact, and
the whole structure becomes thicker from the formation of epidermic
cells without concomitant removal.
   In conclusion, it should    be noted that, by stimulating specimens of
Petromyzon fiuviatilis    with  chloroform vapour, evidence has also been
gained of a similar production of fibres from the bodies of the club
cells.   The conclusions stated at the end of the communication of
which the above is a short abstract are as follows : —
   1. The secreting elements of the epidermis of the Common               Eel
consist of goblet cells and club cells, both direct descendants of the
cells of the palisade layer. The former supply a mucin, the latter
threads and a material appearing as fine granules in the slime.
   2. The goblet cells contain mucin granules, and, after reaching
the surface and discharging their load, are capable of undergoing
regeneration by growth of the protoplasmic foot and re-formation of
mucin.
   3. The threads of the slime resemble those of Myxine glutinosa.

 1893.]    Mr. Poulton.      Colours of Lepidopterous Larvae.         41
 but are usually of finer texture. As in Myxine, they are developed
from the club cells, but there are no special glandular involutions of
the epidermis.     The club cells of Petromyzon fluviaiilis also supply
slime threads.
   4. The granular material of the slime is tbe contents of vesicular
spaces developed in the club cells in the immediate neighbourhood of
their nuclei, and is set free enclosed in a lattice work developed by
vacuolation of the surrounding material, and finally extruded, carry
ing with it the original nucleus of the club cell.
   5. The remainder of the club cell, after extrusion of its vesicle and
nucleus, becomes a spirally coiled fibre, which finally breaks up into
the fine fibrils of the slime.
   6. Severe stimulation, especially by the vapour of chloroform
applied to the intact animal, causes so sudden a development of the
coiled fibres from the club cells that the surface of the epidermis is
thrown off and the secretory products set free en masse. This process
is of reflex nature, for similar excitation applied to excised skin is
without effect.
   7. A system of connective tissue cells, distinct from chromatophores
exists in the epidermis developed from cells which are direct descen
dants of leucocytes, and which can be traced from the blood vessels of
the corium through the basement membrane into the epidermis. The
number of these wandering cells in the epidermis is greatly increased
by stimulation, probably with a view to providing             subsequent
support to the secretory elements during regeneration.
IV. "The Experimental           Proof that the Colours of certain
      Lepidopterous Larvas are largely due to modified Plant
      Pigments, derived from Food."         By E. B. Poulton, F.R.S.
      Received May 12, 1893.
                                (Abstract.)
   The object of this investigation was to afford a conclusive test as
to the theory, previously submitted by the author, that some of the
colours of certain Lepidopterous larvse are made up of modified
chlorophyll derived from the food-plant.
   Larvae from one batch of eggs laid by a female Tryphaina pronuba
were divided into three lots fed (in darkness) respectively throughout
their whole life upon (1) green leaves, (2) yellow etiolated leaves,
and (3) white mid-ribs of cabbage. The larvas fed upon (1) and (2)
became green or brown as in nature, thus proving that etiolin,
no less than chlorophyll, can form the basis of the larval ground
colour. Those fed upon (3), in which neither chlorophyll nor etiolin

42            Dr. W. Marcet.        The Influence    of Exercise   [June 8,
was accessible,   were   entirely unable to form the green or brown
ground-colour. The production of dark superficial cuticular pigment
was, however, unchecked.         One of the larvaa fed in this way was
perfectly healthy, and had become nearly mature when it was acci
dentally killed.   Many others died early, but resembled that last
described in the inability to form a ground-colour.
   The experiment seems to leave no doubt as to the validity of the
conclusions   previously reached.        Interesting questions as to the
changes passed through by         the  derived   pigments are suggested by
this inquiry.
V. " The Influence of Exercise on the Interchange of the
       Respiratory Gases."         By W. Marcet, M.D., F.R.S. Re
       ceived May 18, 1893.
   I   had the honour of communicating two papers to the Royal
Society on the interchange of pulmonary gases — one in June, 1891,*
and another in June, 1892. t
   The methods adopted and instruments employed have been fully
described, and as the present inquiry is a continuation of the former
investigation, carried on by similar methods and with the same
instruments, there will be no necessity to refer to either of these on
the present occasion.
   It might, however, be stated that the expired air was collected in a
bell- jar of a capacity of 40 litres, and over salt water ; the CO» was
determined by Pettenkofer'a method, and the 0 by means of an
eudiometer of a special construction. A short historical sketch of
the work done on the subject under consideration has been given in
the previous papers.
   I  have been very ably assisted in the present inquiry by Mr.
Bernard F. Davis, B.Sc, who kindly submitted to experiment, and
carried out for me, with every care, many determinations of carbonic
acid and oxygen.
   The object of the present communication is to show the influence
of exercise on the interchange of pulmonary gases, but           I must beg
leave to preface the subject with a few remarks.
   It has occurred to me that the words " interchange of respiratory
        "
gases might not at first sight carry with them a perfectly clear mean
                                    "
ing. The word " interchange obviously refers to the movement of
two gases exchanging places, and this applies to the passage of the
oxygen of the air into the blood through the substance of the lungs,
                       * '
                           Proceedings Boy. Soc.,' vol. 60.

 1893.]         on the Interchange      of the .Respiratory      Gases.               43
and of the carbonic acid of the blood into the air of the pulmonary
¦cavity also through the pulmonary tissue.              The word " interchange "
 might be thought to mean that a certain volume of oxygen is ex
changed for an equal volume of C02, but such is not the case, as the
volume of oxygen taken up by the blood, and said to be consumed, is
larger than the corresponding volume of CO» emitted, the difference
being due to the O absorbed, which may be considered as employed
in the phenomena of " tissue-change."
    During ordinary respiration in a perfect state of repose, and under
similar circumstances relating to temperature and food, the formation
of COs and absorption of 0 in the same person alters within certain
limits.      Together with these changes there is a marked tendency for
the oxygen consumed (C02 produced and 0 absorbed) to assume a
•constant figure in the same person, or it may be said that there is a
marked tendency to a decrease of C02 expired being accompanied by
¦an increase of oxygen absorbed,              and vice versa.          Four different
persons     were   experimented upon,       and   this   tendency      is very clearly
shown on three in the accompanying table, in which every figure is
the mean of the two readings most alike.
    In the fourth case, that of my present assistant, Mr. B. F. Davis,
the tendency is of a different kind.
    On a close consideration, the phenomenon observed on the three
first persons experimented upon admits,               I   think, of the following
explanation :   —
    If the carbonic acid expired should suddenly increase, it does so at
the expense of the oxygen absorbed, and there is less of it left for
the purposes of tissue-change ; hence it is observed to diminish at
the same time as the C02 is increased.

                     constant under similar circumstances.

   These experiments show a remarkable uniformity of results in
winter and summer respectively.
   As to the experiments fasting, not tabulated in this paper, while in
summer they agree with those of the three other persons under
experiment, no uniform relation can be traced in winter between the
CO» expired and O absorbed.
   In this case, in the winter and summer experiments referred to,
the CO] expired and O absorbed may be said to rise and fall
together, which means that, instead of a tendency to a constant figure
for O consumed, there is, at all events between 1 and 2 hrs. after a
full meal, the reverse tendency, and the figure for O consumed is
observed either to rise or fall. Consequently there must be in the
case of Mr. Davis a function of the body different from the corre
sponding function in the three other persons.          Now this gentleman
is just twenty-one years of age and is still growing; indeed, there has
been a marked appearance in him of physical development within the
last few months, and       I  fully believe that this is the cause of the
present result. While with the three other persons as the carbonic
acid increased the oxygen absorbed diminished, in this particular case
as the COj increases the O absorbed also becomes larger, this excess
being due, it may be concluded, to the requirements of new tissue.
                             Influence of Exercise.
    The method of investigation was as follows : — In order to adopt a
kind of muscular exercise similar, as near as possible, to one in
common use, I selected the very simple act .of stepping, within a
small area, which imitated walking.          This was done by raising the
feet alternately sixty-eight times a minute, according to the striking
of a metronome.       I raised the feet by nearly 10 cm., and Mr. Davis
by nearly 18 cm., measured at the heel ; consequently the degree of
exercise was not the same in each case.         Moreover, the exercise may
 not have been strictly regular       in every experiment, although suffi
ciently so for the purpose in view. In most cases, before exercise
 was taken, a preliminary experiment was made on the person in
repose; with that object he rested for half an hour, reclining in a
 deck chair, then the air expired in a recorded time (in absolutely
 natural breathing) was collected in the two bell-jars, measured, and
 then transferred to an india-rubber bag faced with oil silk, in order
to liberate the bell-jars for further use. The next part of the experi
ment was stepping and breathing the air expired into a bell-jar
during exercise. It must be understood that this air was not col
lected during the whole time the exercise lasted, but only at the end*
of that time, and during about " 3 mins."
    After the air expired, under exercise, had been collected in a bell-
 jar, the person experimented upon sat down in the deck chair without

 breathing, and then the air he expired was collected as usual for a
 period of 13 or 14 mins.       In this way the whole phenomenon of
 respiration under exercise could be closely followed. The COj alone, or
 C02 and O, were determined in the air expired in the state of repose,
 the COj and O were determined in the air expired under exercise,
 and the CO> alone in the air expired while resting after the period of
 exercise.    It had been found, experimentally, that the time taken to
 fill the two bell- jars (13 to 14 mins.) was sufficient for the CO»
 expired to return to its normal amount.
     The object of the experiment was as follows : — The first stage in
 repose afforded data towards the comparison of the effects of exercise
 on the respiratory functions with those functions in the state of rest.
 The second stage had for its object to determine the CO» and O
 expired in a given time while under the exercise. The third stage
 showed the amount of CO, given out, while quite still, after the
 exercise had been concluded ; and the excess of CO, thus obtained
 over the amount of CO, which would have been expired in the same
 lapse of time in perfect repose was looked upon as CO, which had
accumulated in the blood during exercise, and this was proved by
subsequent experiment.
     [18th August.
                   —Without entering at present into a discussion of this
subject, a number of experiments, which     I regret space does not allow
me to describe, have shown most distinctly that respiration while in
repose following exercise cannot be compared to forced respiration,
inasmuch as in forced respiration the excess of COs expired is much
less than after exercise  ; and, moreover, immediately after a return to
natural breathing after forced respiration the CO, expired is dimin
ished nearly, although not quite, to the same amount as it had been
increased under forced breathing, and this is not observed as a sequel
to exercise.
    I  feel called upon to make this remark in due consideration to
C. Speck's interesting paper on the consumption of oxygen and pro
duction of carbonic acid (' Schriften der Gesellschaft zur Beforderung
der Gesammten Naturwissenschaften zu Marburg,' vol. 10, 1871.)]
    The experiments on myself will be considered first : They were
undertaken in December, January, and February last, and, with two
exceptions, all between 1 and 2 hrs. after a full luncheon.           The
duration of the exercise was from about 17 to 19 mins., this period
being selected, because after 19 or 20 mins. the phenomena were
found to lose their regularity.     The respiratory changes were also
observed to be more regular in winter than in summer, and especially
under the direct influence of digestion ; or under circumstances pro
ducing most carbonic acid in the state of repose.                        ¦
    These experiments show that, in my case, under the            kind, of
 exercise taken, the amount of CO, expired per minute was very

48            Dr. W. Marcet.     The Influence  of Exercise     [June 8,
nearly twice the amount expired in a perfect state of repose (213*3 c.c.
and 434*1 c.c); the mean excess, 221"7, may be looked npon as dne to
the production of heat to be converted into motion, bat it will be
seen presently that there is really more heat developed from carbon
burnt to the extent of about 12 per cent, of the above excess. The
oxygen absorbed, 65*4 c.c, looks much too high, as the mean amount
obtained under the influence of food in my last experiments is 35*7,
and at first it occurred to me that more oxygen was really absorbed
under exercise than in repose. But on inquiring closely into the
present result, it became obvious that this figure for oxygen absorbed
included some oxygen retained in the body as CO,. The next point
was to determine, if possible, how much oxygen was absorbed for
tissue-change, and how much was retained as C02.        This result was
obtained by a consideration of the third stage of the experiment
which concerned resting after exercise.    In this third stage the mean
excess of CO, found to have been expired under exercise over the
GO] expired in repose is equal to 500 c.c. for a mean exercise of
18 mins. 31 sees. ; or, in other words, in 18 mins. 31 sees, an amount
of CO, had accumulated in the body equal to 500 c.c. Assuming that
this accumulation took place regularly, it would have amounted to a
mean of 27*6 c.c. per minute. We are now in a position to find out
the volume of CO, present, together with the amount of O absorbed
per minute ; this is done by subtracting the volume of C02 absorbed
per minute, or 27*4 from the volume of 0 entered as absorbed, or
65*4 ; this gives 38 c.c for the actual volume of oxygen absorbed,
which is very near to the figure 35*7, the mean volume of oxygen
absorbed in my case under food and in the state of repose.
   It then occurred to me that the total COj retained in the blood
under exercise might bear some proportion to the excess of CO,
expired under exercise over the CO, expired sitting.     On calculating
these relations   I found that there certainly was such a ratio. Of
course the ratio varied somewhat in each experiment, but the means
of the ten experiments gave the figure 0'123, while the extremes were
0*110 and 0*140.    Therefore, by multiplying the mean ratio 0*123 by
the excess of the CO, under exercise over the COj in repose, the result
will give, with a certain degree of approximation, the figure for the
CO, absorbed per minute during the exercise without being at the
trouble of determining this figure experimentally.
   We now turn to the corresponding experiments made on Mr. Davis.
There are five of them ; the sixth was discarded from some irregu
larity which could not be accounted for.
   In the first experiment the air expired was collected on beginning
the exercise ; in the second it was collected six minutes after exer
cise was begun ; in the third 9 mins. after; in the fourth 12 mins. ;
and in the fifth 15 mins. after.

   The figures obtained under the heading " 0 and CO, absorbed,"
¦were, with the exception            perhaps of the first, fairly close to each
other, with a mean of 103 c.c.                 By multiplying the factor 0*123
found in my experiment by the mean excess of CO» under exercise
over C02 in repose (the data in repose being obtained from other
experiments), and subtracting the result from the O and COj found
as absorbed, as was done in the other case, the figure for carbonic
acid absorbed is 50, and for 0 absorbed 53 ; the latter being very
near
       " 55," which is, for Mr. Davis, the mean volume of oxygen
absorbed after a meal in the state of repose. Therefore, again, in
the present case in the winter experiments,                  between 1 and 2 hrs.
after a full meal, by applying the factor 0-123, we find the same
volume of oxygen absorbed under exercise as when in a perfect
state of repose.        In the experiments on Mr. Davis, the third stage
had been      omitted,     as the experiments were done before any attempt
to judge experimentally of the COj absorbed in the blood had been
thought of.
   So far the results of these experiments must be considered as de
pending to a great extent on the season of the year — winter — on
the time which has elapsed since food has been partaken of —
1 — 2 hrs. — and on the period during which exercise has been taken —
a period not exceeding 18 or 19 mins. It stands to reason that after
exercise has lasted a certain time the blood cannot take up any more
C02, and this time does not appear to exceed 19 or 20 mins. It was
found, experimentally, that after that period the volume of COj
accumulated in the blood varies greatly.
   The exercise was continued in other experiments for 33 mins.,
42 mins., and 1| hrs., when the volume of COj stored up in the blood
was found to range from 0 c.c. to 353 c.c. In the warm summer
weather the COa formed under exercise appears to leave the blood
at the lungs more rapidly than in winter.                So far    I  have not suc
ceeded in finding any uniform volume absorbed during any given
time in spring and summer, although a number of experiments were
carefully made with that object in view.

    Therefore,   so   far, the accumulation of COj in the body may only
be considered as regular under certain fixed conditions ; but there
is invariably a tendency towards C0a being retained in the blood
the first few minutes exercise is taken after a period of repose.
   A certain number of minutes' after exercise has been commenced
the CO, stored up in the blood is given out.                In C. Bernard's ex
periment, where a solution of sulphuretted hydrogen is injected
into the circulation of a dog, the gas comes out at the mouth in large
volumes in a few successive expirations following deep inspirations.
I should be inclined to think that a similar phenomenon takes place
with reference to CO, in respiration under exercise, the gas accumu
lates in the blood up to a certain stage, and is then given out in the
form of a wave, after which the accumulation goes on afresh, but
the phenomenon is not regular, and depends on many canses which
would be very difficult to determine.            My experiments are certainly
opposed     to the    idea  that   under   exercise  the COj is eliminated as
fast as it is produced, leaving a uniform balance of CO, in the blood.
With prolonged exercise and training the intermittenoe would prob
ably become less and less.
    One of the questions for investigation which occurred to me in the
course of this enquiry was the time required for the carbonic acid
expired and oxygen absorbed to retnrn to their normal condition
of rest after the stepping exercise.            This portion of work was done
 in the season 1891-92, when Mr. Darnell Smith, B.Sc, acted as my
assistant.     We both submitted to experiment. The first stage was
the determination of CO, expired and 0 absorbed after resting for
half an hour perfectly still in the deck chair.* Then tbe person
 under experiment took the stepping exercise for a quarter of an hour,
and sat down, remaining quite still, for 10 mins. After that lapse
of time the CO, expired and O absorbed were again determined.
The results are shown in the following table (p. 51).
    It will be seen in this table that, with both of us, after 10 mins.'
rest the CO, expired had returned to the normal, or very nearly so.
In my case the CO, had quite recovered its mean in repose ; in
 Mr. Smith's it was only by 2 per cent, in excess. The oxygen ab
sorbed was, however, quite altered from its original figures. Instead
of 31"7 c.c.    I  absorbed per minute in repose, the figure had fallen
to 24'8 c.c, and with Mr. Smith it had been reduced from 25*8 c.c.
in repose to 14 c.c. The reason of this phenomenon appears to me
very obvious. While the respiratQiy phenomena are all excited under
exercise, the blood becomes charged with more oxygen than it can
   * In three of    these experiments, on the assumption that 30 mins.' rest after
exercise were sufficient for a return of normal breathing in repose, the CO, and O
were determined 30 mins. after the exercise was over instead of before the exercise
 was begun.

hold in the state of rest ; therefore under the state of repose follow
ing exercise, the blood is sufficiently rich in oxygen to supply the
tissue-change without drawing upon atmospheric air for a further
amount of the gas.
     In the experiments related above, 10 mins.' rest after exercise
sufficed for the carbonic acid expired to return to its normal amount
 in the state in repose ; possibly with some other persons a little longer,
 say, 15 mins., may be necessary.                   As for the period of rest required
 for the O absorbed to return to its normal figure in repose, after step
 ping exercise, half an hour appeared perhaps barely sufficient.                              I
 have considered, however, half an hour's rest as long enough when
 active exercise had not been previously taken ; and half an hour's
 repose was adopted, as a rule, to bring the body into the physiological
  state of rest.
     The following is a summary of the contents of this paper : —
     1st.   I    have shown that in three persons out of four there was a
  great tendency to an uniformity of figure for the oxygen consumed
  nnder similar physical circumstances (food, temperature, &c), so
  that, if the COj expired fell, the oxygen absorbed rose, and vice
  tersd ; thiB was accounted for by assuming that an increase of COi
                                                                                   b 2

  in the blood in the state of repose is produced at the expense of the
  O absorbed.      The fourth person experimented upon exhibited no
  such   tendency,  the C02 expired and 0 absorbed rose and fell
  together, which was ascribed to the fact that he was still growing.
     2nd. Experiments were made on the influence of exercise on
  respiration which showed that if stepping exercise is taken after a
  period of rest, there occurs for a few minutes an accumulation of
  COs in the blood ; of courso the degree of this storage of C02 must
  be controlled by the normal amount of COa produced in repose, and
 the kind of exercise taken ; this storage would in the cold winter
  weather, and between 1 and 2 hrs. after food continue for about 18
 or 20 miiis. In my case the volume of CO» retained in the blood
 amounted to a mean of 500 c.c. while stepping sixty-eight times per
 minute about 10 cm. high. The COj in store is next given out in
the form of a wave, which is renewed after a certain lapse of time,
so that there does not appear to be in respiration nnder exercise a
 fixed relation between the CO» expired and the COj left in the blood.
 With practice and training this relation would probably become
 more and more uniform.
    The storage of C02 in winter and after food was found to exhibit a
certain relation to the excess of COa expired under exercise over the
 COj expired in repose ; but 18 or 20 mins. after exercise had been
 commenced this relation tailed to show itself any longer.
    The ratio in question was the same with two different persons ;
 but further experiment is required to determine whether it can be
 looked upon as general ; the mean ratio found is shown by the figure
0-123 ; therefore, so far as the present enquiry goes, and under the
conditions expressed in this paper, by multiplying this figure 0"123
by the excess of C02 given out per minute under exercise over the
COj expired in repope during the same lapse of time, the i-esult will
show the volume of COa absorbed in the blood per minute.
    After the exercise had lasted 18 io 20 mins., the volnme of CO,
stored up in the blood after exercise was found to vary.
    3rd. After the exercise adopted in this enquiry had been followed
by a complete repose of 10 mins., the C02 expired had returned to
the normal in repose, but the volume of O absorbed per minute had
considerably fallen, clearly owing to the blood having charged itseli
with oxygen during exercise, so that the first few minutes after rest
was taken the blood was in a condition to supply oxygen for tissue
changes without taking it from the air breathed.          After half an
hour's perfect rest following exercise the respiratory changes had
returned to their normal state of repose, or nearly so, the oxygen
absorbed still occasionally showing signs of being a little lower than
before exercise had been taken.

       F. W. Pavt, M.D., F.R.S. Received May           20, 1893.
                               (Abstract.)
  For   a long time I have adopted a process for separating the glyco
gen   of the liver consisting in boiling with potash, pouring into alco
 hol, and collecting the precipitate.    For the purpose of estimation,
the precipitated glycogen was converted by means of sulphuric acid
into glucose, the determination of which gave the information re
quired.  I   afterwards applied the process to blood, and the various
organs and tissues of the body, with the result that a more or less
notable amount of cupric oxide reducing product was obtained, which
I at the time looked upon as taking origin, as in the case of the liver,
from glycogen.
   When small quantities were operated upon for quantitative
analysis,I   experienced no difficulty in obtaining the product looked
for.   When large quantities, however, were taken for the purpose of
collecting it and studying its properties, I invariably failed to obtain
anything like the amount that ought to have been yielded according
to the indications afforded by the quantitative analysis conducted.
These attempts were undertaken at different times upon blood, eggs,
and the spleen.     It was obvious there was something connected with
the extraction with which I was not acquainted, and it was through
prosecuting inquiry to clear up the discrepancy that     I  came across
the knowledge revealed in this communication.
   Detailed particulars are given in the communication of experiments
with various animal and vegetable proteid matters, showing that the
amount of cupric oxide reducing product obtained after the applica
tion of the potash process varied through the instrumentality of the
potash.    If free glycogen or starch had been the source of       it,
                                                                     the
treatment with potash should have produced no effect beyond dis
solving the associated nitrogenous matter and placing   it in a position
to be separable by the agency of the alcohol, and no difference should
have resulted from varying the strength of the alkali or the length of
time of contact. The results obtained led to the conclusion that the
cupric oxide reducing product must have taken origin from some
other source than free glycogen or starch, and pointed to its having
been derived from a cleavage of the proteid molecule.
   The steps of procedure employed for obtaining the product sus
ceptible of conversion into   a   cupric oxide reducing body (sugar)
from proteid matter are described at length, and an account given of
the difficulties which had led to    a   want of success in my early
endeavours to collect the body in quantity.       With tho knowledge

54                           Dr. F. W. Pavy.                     [June 8,
that is now possessed, no difficulty is experienced in obtaining it in
any amount that may be required for the purpose of examination or
experiment. Coagulated egg-albumin, purified by water, was selected
as the most suitable representative form of proteid to serve for yield
ing the prod net.
    The properties of the material obtained are as follows : —
    In the dried state it forms a hard glassy resinoid mass.
    It is readily soluble in water, giving a clear solution.
    It yields no coloration with iodine.
    It possesses no CuO reducing power.
     Strong alcohol precipitates it. Spirit of 85 to 90 per cent, strength
 precipitates it in great part, if not completely, as an adherent tena
 cious gummy mass, from which the alcohol may be decanted off, and
 which may be afterwards worked up to form a sticky material. Abso
 lute alcohol, used freely, throws it down as a fine white precipitate
 with no tendency to coalesce to a gummy mass. Upon the gummy
 precipitate absolute alcohol exerts a dehydrating action, causing it
 to harden and assume a crumbled, in place of a cohesive, state. With
 spirit below 85 per cent, strength, precipitation becomes more and
 more incomplete, and the precipitate produced by the weaker kind of
 spirit assumes a loose or non-adherent form. The incomplete preci
 pitation with weak strengths is readily betrayed by the further pre
 cipitation which occurs upon adding more alcohol to the supernatant
 spirit.
     In its physical characters, it presents a resemblance to Landwehr's
  " animal
              gum." Chemically, it also resembles Landwehr's " animal
  gum," in forming a copper compound on being treated with enpric
 sulphate and caustic potash, from which it is susceptible of recovery
  by the agency of nitric acid and subsequent precipitation with
 alcohol.
     I have applied Landwehr's process to the product under considera
  tion derived from the action of potash upon albumin, and have found
  that it behaves throughout like Landwehr's "animal gum," and
  similarly yields a CuO reducing body. Moreover,       I have found that
  this CuO reducing body gives, with phenylhydrazine, needle
  crystals of glucosazone, of which        I  have obtained micro-photo
  graphs.
      The product, it may be finally remarked, possesses the property of
  diffusibility, a character in which it differs from the amylose carbo
  hydrates — starch, glycogen, dextrin.     I have been unable to find any
  statement about the diffusibility or otherwise of " animal gum," but
  it is described as being a constant constituent of urine, which may be
  regarded as indicative of its being of a diffusible nature.
      The CuO Reducing Product. — By the action of mineral acids, the
  first-formed product, of which    I have been speaking, undergoes con

1893.]        The Glucoside Constitution      of Proteid Matter.              55
version into a CuO reducing material. For effecting this conversion
I have for years past been in the habit of using 2 per cent, sulphuric
acid.    As  I have said, my impression originally was that the product
consisted   of glycogen, and from observations upon the conversion of
starch and glycogen into glucose,          I had formed the opinion that
snlphuric acid of the strength named best met the requirements.
Boiling for about an hour and a half with an inverted condenser was
resorted to, or the autoclave     was used, half-an-hour's       exposure to a
temperature of 150° C. producing          an equivalent effect, the results
given by the two methods being practically identical.                Whore the
object has been a quantitative analysis, the acid has been subse
quently neutralised     with potash, the sulphate formed not occasioning
any  inconvenience    ; but should   it be desired  to collect the reducing
product, the acid must be removed          by precipitation, best effected by
the agency of barium carbonate ; the filtrate, after evaporation               to
dryness on the water-bath, yields the material in the state desired.
   I had been led by certain circumstances to consider that the
reducing product derived from the action of the 2 per cent, acid did
not consist of glucose, and had unsuccessfully tried, by more extended
periods of boiling, to get it carried further.                        I
                                                    Subsequently renewed
my   efforts  in this direction. In experimenting with cellulose, I had
found that but very slight action was produced by 2 per cent, acid,
while considerable effect followed the use of acid of 10 per cent,
strength, and it occurred to me that the body I was dealing with
might behave similarly.        Trying 10 per cent, acid, I found that the
reducing power of the product became very nearly doubled, being
raised in the proportion of from between 50 and 60 to 100.               I  next
tried 50 per cent, acid, allowed to remain in contact with the product
for one to three days, then diluted to 20 per cent., and boiled.             The
result stood about the same as after direct boiling with 10 per cent,
acid.    After 15 per cent, acid, also, a like result was obtained. As
yet  I  have failed to carry the body to a higher stage of CnO reducing
power than that produced by 10 per cent, acid, but            I  am still led to
think that the glucose stage has not yet been reached.              The effect of
raising   the   reducing power   is to  give a semblance   of  a  corresponding
increase of material.
    The following are the characters of the product obtained after the
separation of the sulphuric acid by barium carbonate and evaporation
 of the filtered liquid to dryness :—
    It presents the appearance of a sugary extractive, and has a pro
 nounced baked-sugar odour.
    It is very soluble in water, only slightly so in absolute alcohol, but
 considerably so in spirit of about 90 per cent, strength.
    It is readily diffusible.
    Boiled with caustic potash (Moore's test), the solution darkens.

  56           The Glucoside Constitution of Proteid Matter.       [June 8,
     It  dissolves hydrated copper oxide in presence of excess of potash
   (Trommer'8 test), without producing a biuret reaction ; at least,
   specimens are often procurable of which this can bo said.
     With Fehling's solution, it gives a strong and neat reaction, the
   reduced copper oxide falling as a dense red precipitate.
     Heated on the water-bath for two or three hours with phenylhydr-
. azine and acetic acid, it yields, on cooling, a crystalline osazone in the
  form of needles clustered into sheaves or brushes, or radiating in
  dense round masses.      Often the composite character of these round
  masses is only to be seen by close inspection of the circumference.
  Whilst a certain type prevails, variations within limits are noticeable,
  and sometimes an approach to a spike constitution is observable.
  The crystals are soluble in alcohol, from which they may be recrystal-
  lised.
     It gives with benzoyl chloride an insoluble compound, in accord
  with the behaviour of carbohydrates.
     With a-naphthol and excess of strong sulphuric acid, it behaves
  like sugar in giving a deep-violet colour, and leading on dilution to
  the formation of a violet-blue precipitate soluble in alcohol, ether,
  and caustic potash, with the production of yellow solutions, but
  insoluble in hydrochloric acid, a character by which, according to
  Molisch, the precipitate produced from sugar is distinguishable from
  that derived from peptone and various albuminous bodies.
     With thymol and excess of strong sulphuric acid, it again behaves
  like sugar, giving a deep-red coloration, followed, on dilation, by the
  production of a carmine-red precipitate, soluble in alcohol, ether, and
  caustic potash, with formation of pale-yellow solutions, and in am
  monia with formation of a bright-yellow solution. The precipitate,
  as in the case of the a-naphthol test, is found to possess the character
  of insolubility in hydrochloric acid.
     It is susceptible of being thrown down in combination with oxide
  of lead, by the employment of lead acetate and ammonia, and is
  afterwards recoverable from the compound.          From the sugar thus
  recovered, the usual reaction is obtainable with Fehling's solution
  (provided the ammonia has been fully removed) ; and also the crys
  talline osazone with phenylhydrazine, of which micro-photographs are
  furnished.
      From this assemblage of positive characters, it appears to me there
  can bo no doubt that the CuO reducing body obtainable from proteid
  matter consists of sugar.    I should state, however, that     I have not
  yet obtained it in a form to prove fermentable ; and Dr. Sheridan Lea,
  who kindly examined it with the polarimeter, failed to notice any
  rotation of which he could speak with certainty. He adds there was,
 if anything, a tendency to loevorotation, but not amounting to more
 than 01°.

  In addition to the evidence derivable from the positive characters-
mentioned as possessed by the CuO reducing product, there is the
corroborative evidence to be taken into account supplied by the
characters of agreement observable between my primary non-reducing
product and Landwehr's
                             " animal gum." As already shown, the
product in question can be thrown down, precisely like " animal
gum," in combination with copper oxide, and is afterwards recover
able and convertible into a CuO reducing body, which yields with
phenylhydrazine a crystalline osazone. The micro-photos, supplied
show two kinds of crystals, one consisting distinctly of the long
needles of glucosazone.     In its ready mode of separating out, the
osazone was observed to agree with that derived from glucose.            A
10 per cent,  strength of sulphuric acid was employed in obtaining the
CuO redncing product operated upon.

    § 1. A crystal in nature is essentially a homogeneous assemblage of
equal and similar molecules, which for brevity           I shall call crystalline
 molecules.    The crystalline molecule may be the smallest portion
 which can be taken from the substance without chemical decomposi
tion,  that is to say, it may     be  the gronp of atoms       kept together by
chemical affinity, which constitutes what for brevity            I  shall call the
¦chemical molecule ; or it may be a group of two, three, or more of
 these chemical molecules kept together by cohesive force. In a crystal
-of tartaric acid the crystalline molecule may be, and it seems to me
 probably is, the chemical molecule, because if a crystal of tartaric
 acid is dissolved and recrystallised it always remains dextro-chiral.
 In a crystal of chlorate of soda, as has been pointed out to me by Sir
 George Stokes, the crystalline molecule probably consists of a group
 of two or more of the chemical molecules constituting chlorate of
 soda, because, as found by Marbach,* crystals of the substance are
 some of them dextro-chiral and some of them levo-chiral ; and if a
 crystal of either chirality is dissolved the solution shows no chirality
 in its action on polarised light ; but if it is recrystallised the crystals
«re found to be some of them dextro-chiral and some of them levo-
 chiral, as shown both by their crystalline forms and by their action on
 polarised light.    It is possible, however, that even in chlorate of soda
the crystalline molecule may be the chemical molecule, because it
 may be that the chemical molecule in solution has its atoms relatively
 mobile enough not to remain persistently in any dextro-chiral or levo-
 chiral grouping, and that each individual chemical molecule settles

into either a doxtro-chiral or levo-chiral configuration in the act of
forming a crystal.
     § 2. Certain it is that the crystalline molecule has a chiral configura
tion in every crystal which shows chirality in its crystalline form or-
which produces right- or left-handed rotation of the piano of polarisa
tion of light passing through it. The magnetic rotation has neither
right-handed nor left-handed quality (that is to say, no chirality,).
This was perfectly understood by Faraday and made clear in his
writings, yet even to the present day we frequently find the chiral
rotation and the magnetic rotation of the plane of polarised light
 classed together in a manner against which Faraday's original de
 scription of his discovery of the magnetic polarisation contains ample
warning.
     § 3. These questions, however, of chirality and magnetic rotation do
 not belong to my present subject, which is merely the forcive*
required to keep a crystal homogeneously strained to any infinitesi
mal extent from the condition in which it rests when no force acts
upon it from without.              In the elements of the mathematical theory
of elasticity'!' we find that this forcive constitutes what is called a
homogeneous stress, and is specified completely by six generalised
force-components,           pt, p%, p,, . , . . , pt, which are related to six corre

1893.]       Elasticity of a Crystal according        to   Boscovich.          61
  § 4. Each crystalline molecule in reality certainly experiences forcive
from some of its nearest neighbours on two sides, and probably also
from next nearest     neighbours and others.           Whatever the mutual
forcive between two mutually acting crystalline molecules is in
reality, and however it is produced, whether by continuous pressure
in some medium, or by action at a distance, we may ideally reduce it,
according to elementary statical principles, to two forces, or to one
single force and a couple in a plane perpendicular to that force.
Boscovich's theory, a purely mathematical idealism, makes each crys
talline molecule a single point, or a group of points, and assumes that
there is a mutual force between each point of one crystalline molecule
and each point of neighbouring crystalline molecules, in the line join
ing the two points. The very simplest Boscovichian idea of a crystal
is a homogeneous group of single points.          The next simplest idea is a
homogeneous group of double points.
   § 5. In the present communication,          I demonstrate that, if we take
the very simplest Boscovichian idea of a crystal, a homogeneous
group of single points, we find essentially six relations between the
twenty-one coefficients in the quadratic function expressing w,
whether in terms of «i, . . . . , s« or of p,       , _p,. These six relations
are such that infinite resistance to change of bulk involves infinite
rigidity.    In the particular case of an equilateral* homogeneous
assemblage with such a law of force as to give equal rigidities for all
directions of shearing, these six relations give Zk = 5'ji, which is the
relation found by Navier and Poisson in their Boscovichian theory
for isotropic elasticity in a solid. This relation was shown by Stokes
to be violated by many real homogeneous isotropic substances, such,
for example, as jelly and india-rubber, which oppose so great resist
ance to compression and so small resistance to change of shape, that
we may, with but little practical error, consider them as incompressible
elastic solids.
    § 6. I next demonstrate that if we take the next simplest Bosco
 vichian idea for a crystal, a homogeneous group of double points, we
 can assign very simple laws of variation of the forces between the
 points which shall give any arbitrarily assigned value to each of the
 twenty-one coefficients in either of the quadratic expressions for to.
    § 7. 1 consider particularly the problem of assigning such values to
 the twenty-one coefficients of either of the quadratic formulas as shall
 render the solid incompressible.        This is most easily done by taking
 <••as a quadratic  function of px          , pt, and by taking   one of these
  * That   is to say, an assemblage in which the lines from any point to three
neighbours nearest to it and to one another are inclined at 60°jto one another ; and
these neighbours are at equal distances from it. This implies that each point has
twelve equidistant nearest neighbours around   it, and that any tetrahedron of four
nearest neighbours lias for its four faces four equal equilateral triangles.

 generalised stress components,       say pt, as uniform positive or negative
 pressure in all directions.         This makes st uniform compression or
 extension in all directions, and makes *,,...,, ,s5 five distortional com
 ponents with no change of bulk.           The condition that the solid shall
 be incompressible     is then simply that the coefficients of the six terms
 involving pt are each of them zero.             Thus, the expression for to
 becomes merely a quadratic function of the five distortional stress-
components,     pi,. . . . , pt, with fifteen independent coefficients : and
 equations (3) of § 3 above express the five distortional components as
 linear functions of the five stress-components . with these fifteen
independent coefficients.

    § 8. To demonstrate the propositions of § 5, let OX, OY, OZ be
three mutually perpendicular lines through any point 0 of a homo
geneous assemblage, and let x, y, z be the coordinates of any other
point P of the assemblage, in its unstrained condition. As it is a
homogeneous assemblage of single points that we are now considering,
there must be another point P', whose coordinates are — x, — y, — g.
Let (x + 8x, y + Sy, z + Sz) be the coordinates of the altered position of
P in any condition of infinitesimal strain, specified by the six symbols
«, /, g, a, b, c, according to the notation of Thomson and Tait's
'Natural Philosophy,' Vol. I, Pt..II, § 669. In this notation, e,f, g
denote simple infinitesimal elongations parallel to OX, OT, OZ re
spectively; and o, b, c infinitesimal changes from the right angles
between three pairs of planes of the substance, which, in the un
strained condition, are parallel to (XOT, XOZ), (TOZ, TOX),
 (ZOX, ZOY) respectively (all angles being measured in terms of the
radian). The definition of a, b, c may be given, in other words, as
follows, with a taken as example : a denotes the difference of com
ponent motions parallel to OY of two planes of the substance at unit
distance asunder, kept parallel to YOX during the displacement ; or,
which is the same thing, the difference of component motions parallel
to OZ of two planes at unit distance asunder kept parallel to ZOX
during the displacement.          To avoid the unnecessary consideration of
rotational displacement, we shall suppose the displacement corre
sponding to the strain-component a to consist of elongation perpen
dicular to OX in the plane through OX bisecting YOZ, and shrinkage
perpendicular to OX in the plane through OX perpendicular to that
bisecting plane.       This displacement gives no contribution to Bx, and
contributes to ?y and cz respectively \az and \ay. Hence, and deal
ing similarly with b and c, and taking into account the contributions
of e, f, g, we find

     § 10. Going back now to § 3, let ns find w, the work per nnit
 volnme, required to alter our homogeneous assemblage from -its un
 strained condition to the infinitesimally strained condition specified
 by e,f,   g, a, b, c. Let 0(r) be the work required to bring two points of
 the system       from   an infinitely great distance asunder to distance r.
 This is what I shall call the mutual potential energy of two points at
 distance r. What          I shall now call the potential energy of the whole
 system, and denote by W, is the total work which must be done to
 bring all the points of it from infinite mutual distances to their actual
 positions in the system ; so that we have
                                     W=§220(r)                           (10),
 where 20 (r) denotes the sum of the values of 0(r) for the distances
 between any one point 0, and all the others; and 220 (r) denotes
 the sum of these sums with the point O taken successively at every
 point of the system. In this double summation 0 (r) is taken twice
over, whence the factor         f  in the formula (10).
     § 11.  Suppose      now  the   law of force to be such that 0(r) vanishes
 for every value of r greater than vX, where X. denotes the distance
 between any one point and its nearest neighbour, and v any small or
 large numeric exceeding unity, and limited only by the condition
 that v\ is very small in comparison with the linear dimensions of
 the whole assemblage.          This, and the homogeneonsness of our assem
 blage, imply      that,  except  through a very thin surface layer of thick
 ness v\ exceedingly small in comparison with diameters of the
 assemblage, every point experiences the same set of balancing forces
 from neighbours as every other point, whether the system be in what
 we have called its unstrained condition or in any condition whatever
 of homogeneous strain. This strain is not of necessity an infinitely
small strain, so far as concerns the proposition just stated, although
in our mathematical work we limit ourselves to strains which are
infinitely small.
    § 12. Remark also that if the whole system be given as a homo
geneous assemblage of any specified description, and if all points in
the surface-layer be held by externally applied forces in their posi
tions as constituents of a finite homogeneous assemblage, the whole
assemblage will be in equilibrium under the influence of mutual
forces between the points ; because the force exerted on any point O
by any point P is balanced by the equal and opposite force exerted
by the point P' at equal distance on the opposite side of O.
   § 13. Neglecting now all points in the thin surface layer, let N
denote the whole number of points in the homogeneous assemblage

 and using (8) in this, and remarking that if (as in § 14 below) we
 take the volume of our assemblage as unity, so that N is the number
 of points per unit volume, SW becomes the w of § 3 ; we find

    § 14. Let us now suppose, for simplicity, the whole assemblage, in
its unstrained condition, to be a cube of unit edge, and let P be the
 sum of the normal components of the extraneous forces applied to
the points of the surface-layer in one of the faces of the cube. The
equilibrium of the cube, as a whole, requires an equal and opposite
normal component P in the opposite face of the cube. Similarly, let
Q and R denote the sums of the normal components of extraneous
force on th9 two other pairs of faces of the cube. Let T be the sum
of tangential components, parallel to OZ, of the extraneous forces on
either of the YZ faces. The equilibrium of the cube as a whole
reqnires four such forces on the four faces parallel to OY, constituting

  This remarkable relation between the two rigidities and the com
  pressibility of an equilateral homogeneous assemblage of Boscovich
  atoms was announced without proof in § 27 of my paper on the
  " Molecular Constitution of Matter."*                 In it n denotes what I called
  the facial rigidity, being rigidity relative to shearings parallel to the
  faces of the principal cube :f and nt the diagonal rigidity, being
  rigidity relative to shearings parallel to any of the six diagonal
  planes through pairs of mutually remotest parallel edges of the same
 cube.       By (24) and (23) we see that if the law of force be such that
                                     2w^  r = 32tr^     r                          (27),
 we have n       = tt|, and the body constituted by the assemblage is wholly
 isotropic in its elastic quality.             In this case (26) becomes 3i = 5n,
 as found by Navier and Poisson ; and thus we complete the demon
 stration of the statements of § 5 above.
      § 21. A case which is not uninteresting in respect to Boscovichian
 theory, and which is very interesting indeed in respect to mechanical
 engineering (of which the relationship with Boscovich's theory has
 been pointed oat and beautifully illustrated by M. Brillouin),J is the
case of an equilateral homogeneous assemblage with forces only
 between each point and its twelve equidistant nearest neighbours.
The annexed diagram (fig. 2) represents the point 0 and three of its
 twelve nearest neighbours (their distances X), being in the middles
 of the near faces of the principal cube shown in the diagram ; and
three of its six next-nearest neighbours (their distances X\/2), being
 at X, T, Z, the corners of the cube nearest to it; and, at other
 corners of the cube, three other neighbours K, L, M, which are next-
 next-next-nearest (their distances 2 X). The points in the middles of
 the three remote sides of the cube, not seen in the diagram, are next-
 next-nearest neighbours of 0 (their distances Xv/3).

three planes cutting one another at right angles through 0 ; and the
centres of these twelve squares are the twelve nearest neighbours of

    § 23. Suppose now O to experience force only from its twelve
nearest neighbours : the summations 2 of § 18 (23) will include just
these twelve points with equal values of v for all. These yield eight
terms to 2     (*'//),  and four to 2 (yV/r4)    ; and the value of each term
in   these sums   is \.    Thus we find that
                        A = N»,       and    B = n = JHw                   (29).

Thus we have the remarkable result that, relatively to the principal
cube, the diagonal rigidity is half the facial rigidity when each point
experiences force only from its twelve nearest neighbours.               This pro
position was announced without proof in § (28) of
                                                                 " Molecular Con
stitution of Matter."*
   § 24. Suppose now the points in the middles of the faces of the
cubes which in the equilateral assemblage are O's twelve equi
distant nearest neighbours to be removed, and the assemblage to
consist of points in simplest cubic order ; that is to say, of Bosco-
vichian points at the points of intersection of three sets of equidistant
parallel planes dividing space into cubes.             Fig. 2 shows O ; and, at
X, Y, Z, three of the six equidistant nearest neighbours which it has
in the simple cubic arrangement.           Keeping X with the same signifi
cation in respect  to fig.  2  as before, we have now for the coordinates
of O's six nearest neighbours :
                  (X-/2,   0, 0), (0, Xv/2, 0), (0, 0,   X/2),
              (-X-/2,    0,  0), (0,  -Xv/2,  0), (0, 0,   -Xv/2).
   Hence, and denoting by       wx the value of w for this case, we find, by
§18(23),
                        A =    Nnr,    and   B =    ra  =  0                 (31).
The explanation of n =        0  (facial rigidity zero) is obvious when we
consider that a cube having for its edges twelve equal straight bars,
with their ends jointed by threes at the eight corners, affords no
resistance  to change of the       right angles of its faces to acute and
obtuse angles.
   § 25. Replacing now the Boscovich points in the middles of the
faces of the cubes, from which we supposed them temporarily
annulled in § 24, and putting the results of § 23 and § 24 together,
we find for our equilateral homogeneous assemblage its elasticity
moduluses as follows :
                              A=     T$(w0 + w1')   1

and whatever be the distance between                     any point and its nearest
neighbours.           The    first  three  of  them    require in the case of § 23
that     F(X) = 0 ; and in the case of (24) that F(AV2) = 0, results of
which the interpretation is obvious and important.
   § 27. The first three of the six equilibrium equations, § 16 (18),
applied to the case of § 25, yield the following equation : —
                                   vWXv/2)       =   -F(X)                            (35);
that is to say, if there is repulsion or attraction between each point
and ite twelve nearest neighbours, there is attraction or repulsion
of   v^2     of its amount between each point and its six next-nearest
neighbours, unless there are also forces between more distant points.
This result is easily verified by simple synthetical and geometrical
considerations of the equilibrium between a point and its twelve
nearest and six next- nearest neighbours in an equilateral homogeneous
assemblage.          The consideration of it is exceedingly interesting and
important in respect to, and in illustration of, the engineering of
jointed structures with rednndant links or tie-struts.
   § 28. Leaving, now, the case of an equilateral homogeneous as.
semblage, let us consider what we may call a scalene assemblage ,
that is to say, an assemblage in which there are three sets of parallel
rows of points, determinatoly fixed as follows, according to the system
first taught by Bravais : — *
         I. Just   one set of rows of points at consecutively shortest dis
               tances X].
      II.    Just one set of rows of points at consecutively next-shortest
               distances X,.
    III. Just      one set of rows of points at consecutive distances shorter
               than those of all other rows not in the plane of             I and II.
    To the condition X3 > X, > Xj we may add the condition that none
of the angles between the three sets of rows is a right angle, iu
 order that our assemblage may be what we may call wholly scalene.

    Thus A' and A are O's nearest neighbours ; and B' and B, O's
next-nearest neighbours ; and C and C, O's nearest neighbours not in
the plane AOB.           (It should be understood that there may be in the
plane AOB points which, though at greater distances from 0 than B
and B', are nearer to 0 than are C and C.)
    § 30. Supposing, now, BOC, B'OC, Ac., to be the acute angles
between the three lines meeting in O ; we have two equal and di-
chirally similar* tetrahedrons of each of which each of the four faces
is a scalene acute-angled triangle.          That every angle in and between
the faces is acute we readily see, by remembering that OC and OC
are shorter than the distances of 0 from any other of the points on
the two sides of the plane AOB.f
    § 31. As a preliminary to the engineering of an incompressible
elastic solid according to Boscovich, it is convenient now to consider
a special case of scalene tetrahedron, in which perpendiculars from
the four corners to the four opposite faces intersect in one point.                  I
do not know if the species of tetrahedron which fulfils this condition
has found a place in geometrical treatises, but I am informed by Dr.
Forsyth that it has appeared in Cambridge examination papers.                    For
my present purpose          it occurred  to  me  thus:  —  Let   QO,    QA,  QB,  QC
be four lines of given lengths drawn from one point, Q. It is required
to draw them in such relative directions that the volume of the tetra
hedron OABC is a maximum. Whatever be the four given lengths,
this problem clearly has one real solution and one only : and it is such
that the four planes BOC, COA, AOB, ABC are cut perpendicularly
by the lines AQ, BQ, CQ, OQ, respectively, each produced through Q.
Thus we see that the special tetrahedron is defined by four lengths,
and conclude that two equations among the six edges of the tetra
hedron in general are required to make it our special tetrahedron.
    § 32. Hence we see the following simple way of drawing a special
tetrahedron. Choose as data three sides of one face and the length
   * Either of these may be turned round so as to coincide with the image of the
other in any plane mirror. Either may be called a pervert of the other; as,
according to the usage of some writers, an object is called a pervert of another if
one of them can be brought to coincide with the image of the other in a plane
mirror (as, for example, a right hand and a loft hand).

perpendicular to it from the opposite angle.     The planes through this
perpendicular, and the angles of the triangle, contain the perpen
diculars from these angles to the opposite faces of the tetrahedron,
and therefore cut the opposite sides of the triangle perpendicularly.
(Thus, parenthetically, we have a proof of the known theorem of
elementary geometry that the perpendiculars from the three angles
of a triangle to the opposite sides intersect in one point.) Let ABC
he the chosen triangle and S the point in which it is cut by the per
pendicular from 0, the opposite corner of the tetrahedron.      AS, BS,
CS, produced through S, cut the opposite sides perpendicularly, and
therefore we find the point S by drawing two of these perpendiculars
and taking their point of intersection. The tetrahedron is then found
by drawing through S a line SO of the given length perpendicular
to the plane of ABC. (We have, again parenthetically, an interesting
geometrical theorem.    The perpendiculars from A, B, C to the planes
of OBC, OCA, OAB cut OS in the same point; SO being of any
arbitrarily chosen length.)

solid of wholly oblique crystalline configuration can be constructed
without going beyond Boscovich for material. Consider, in any
scalene assemblage, the plane of the line A'OA through any point O
and its nearest neighbours, and the line B'OB through the same
point and its next-nearest neighbours. To fix tho ideas, and avoid
circumlocutions, we shall suppose this plane to be horizontal. Con
sider the two parallel planes of points nearest to the plane above it
and below it. The corner C of the acute-angled tetrahedron OABC,
which we have been considering, is one of the points in one of the two
nearest parallel planes, that above AOB we. shall suppose. And the
corner C of the equal and dichirally similar tetrahedron OA'B'C is
one of the points in the nearest parallel plane below.    All the points
in  the  plane through C are corners of equal tetrahedrons chirally
similar to OABC, and standing on the horizontal triangles oriented

of tetrahedrons chirally similar to OA'B'C placed downwards ou

OABC is       of the volume of the parallelepiped, of which OA,

of all the upward tetrahedrons having their bases in one plane is of          £
the volume of the space between large areas of these planes and,          :
therefore, the sum of all the chirally similar tetrahedrons, such as
OABC,     is   iof the whole volume of the assemblage through any
larger space.      Hence any homogeneous strain of the assemblage
which does not alter the volume of the tetrahedrons does not alter
the volume of the solid.          Let tie-struts OQ, AQ, BQ, CQ be
placed between any point           within the tetrahedron and its four

it our special tetrahedron, we have six quantities arbitrarily assignable,

   The paper describes a series of observations of magnetic quality      in
various specimens of sheet iron and iron wire.          A principal object
was to determine the amount of enorgy lost in consequence of magnetic
hysteresis when the iron under examination was carried through
cyclic magnetising processes between assigned limits of the magnetic
induction B. For this purpose observations of the relation of the in
duction   B to the magnetic force H were made, from which curves were
drawn, and the area enclosed by the curves in cyclic magnetising pro
cesses was measured.       Many such cycles were gone through in the
case  of each of the specimens, the limits between which B was re
versed being varied step by step in successive cycles, to allow the
relation of the energy expended or of    jHdl  to B to be determined.  The
curves of    B and H in these graded cycles are drawn in the paper, as
well as curves showing the relation of jHdl to B and to H.         Most of
these experiments      wero made by the ballistic method, the specimens

being in the form of rings. The iron examined was, for the most
part, thin sheet metal or wire such as is used in the construction of
transformer cores. The experiments show that there are marked
differences in the values of      j'Hdl in different specimens, some nomin
ally soft iron requiring two and even three times as much work to be
spent in reversing its magnetism             as is required in the best iron.
They show, further, that great permeability does not necessarily
imply small hysteresis losses. The order of merit in a group of
samples is not the same when permeability is made the criterion of
magnetic softness as it is when the smallness of JIIcZI is made the cri
terion.
   In connexion with these results a formula proposed by Mr. C. P.
 Steinmetz ((Hdl = cB1'6)* to express the relation of the hysteresis
losses to   B is discussed, and it is shown that although such a formula
may serve fairly well as an approximate statement of the relation
within those limits of B which are important in practice, it fails when
applied to the more extreme portions of the curve.
   The authors go on to describe a second group of experiments, in
which direct measurements were made of the heat developed in mag
netic reversals.       The method consisted in using two rings, alike in
all respects, with divided magnetising coils. One ring had its coils
coupled so that the two parts opposed each other, and the core was
consequently not magnetised when a current passed. The other ring
was active, and its coils (coupled inductively) were connected in
series with the non-inductive coils of the inactive ring.                Alternating
currents were passed through both, and the active ring became heated
by the effects of hysteresis and Foucault currents. To balance this a
steady current was caused to flow in the core of the inactive ring, and
the energy expended in the magnetic reversals of the active ring was
found by measuring the energy which had to be expended in this cur
rent in order that the temperature of the two rings might continue
equal.    In some cases the rings used were miniature transformers,
and the test was applied to see whether the energy expended in mag
netic reversals remained the same when the secondary of the trans
former was closed as when it was open. This question had been
raised by more than one experimentalist in relation to tests of the
efficiency of transformers. The authors could not detect any difference-
 in the amount of energy consumed in the core when the " load " was
taken off or put on the secondary.
   In a third group of experiments the magnetic curve tracer was used
to examine certain features of the curves of magnetisation. This in
strument, invented by one of the authors, draws curves which exhibit
the relation of the magnetisation of given samples of iron or steel to

the   magnetising current. Amongst other points referred to in this
connexion    is the time-lag in magnetisation, which is well shown by
the curve-tracer, and the effects are compared of the samo cycle of
magnetic force gone through at various speeds.           It is shown that in
solid bars 1'9 cm. in diameter, especially in soft iron, remarkable
evidences of time-lag are seen, even when the period of magnetic
reversal is as long as 3 sees.   The work spent per cycle is a maximum
at a particular frequency, which in such bars is very low.
    The fourth and last section of the paper relates to the molecular
theory of magnetisation, and describes experiments made with groups
of small pivoted magnets.       It is shown that the behaviour of such
groups, when exposed to the action of a variable magnetic field,
 presents striking points of resemblance to the behaviour of iron or
steel under corresponding variations of magnetising force.            Results
are given which tend to confirm the theory.
    The particulars of the observations are set out in about forty sheets
of curves    which accompany the paper.
III. "Polarisation of Platinum Electrodes in Sulphuric Acid."
        By James B. Henderson, B.Sc Communicated by Lord
        Kelvin, P.R.S. Received June 10, 1893.
    This investigation was begun about tho beginning of February,
 1893,   at the instigation of Lord Kelvin, and was conducted in the
 Physical Laboratory of Glasgow University.          The object of the in
vestigation     was  to obtain the  difference of   potential   between two
platinum electrodes immersed in a solution of sulphuric acid imme
diately after the stoppage of a current which had been electrolysing
 the solution, and to find how this difference varied with a variation in
the intensity of the current or in the strength of the solution.
    Former experiments by Buff (' Poggendorff,' vol. 130, p. 341, 1867)
and Fromme (' Wiedemann,' vol. 33, p. 80, 1888) have given for the
 maximum polarisation with platinum wires of very small surface in
 the electrolysis of dilute sulphuric acid 3"5 and 4"6 volts.
     Dr. Franz Richarz, in a paper " On the Polarisation of Small Elec
 trodes in Dilute Sulphuric Acid," read before the British Association
 at Bath (1888), says of the above : —
     " In these experiments the polarisation is calculated from measure
 ments of the intensity of the galvanic current during the electrolysis,
 tacitly assuming that the resistance of the decomposition cell is in
 dependent of the intensity of the galvanic current.          The correctness
 of the supposition has not been proved.          I  tried experiments by
 similar methods, and obtained yet greater values of the polarisation ;
  it was calculated with a current density of 12 amperes per square

with increasing intensity of the galvanic current. It is very improb
able that this can be right. By supposing, however, that the resist
ance of the decomposition cell is not independent of the intensity,
but decreases in a fixed manner with increasing intensity, the calcula
tion of the same experiments gives small and constant values of
polarisation."

          BATTERY
    The method Dr. Richarz used to find the polarisation in his investi
gation was independent of the resistance of the electrolytic cell. The
battery electrolytic cell and a switch, cx, were joined in closed circuit.
A branch circuit containing a very high resistance, a galvanometer,
and another switch, Cj, joined the two sides of the switch cY (ci and c,
were the two contacts of a Helmholtz's pendulum interrupter). When
c, was made there was a very small current through the galvanometer.
To determine the polarisation Ci was broken, and immediately after c,
also.   In the short time between the interruption of Ci and &> a current
strong for the sensibility of the galvanometer went through it. The
polarisation was calculated from the deflection given to the galvano
meter needle by the impact of the current, which was proportional to
the electromotive force of the battery minus the polarisation. In this
way Dr. Richarz found values for the polarisation never greater than
2-b' volts with small wire electrodes, and also got the same maximum
with large platinum plates.
   The cell used in the present investigation was a cylindrical glass
vessel 10 cm. diameter and 12 cm. deep.       The electrodes were rect
angular plates of platinum foil 7 cm. long by 5"5 cm. broad, and were
stiffened by being mounted on rectangular frames made by bending
glass tubing (fig. 2).      The tubing of these frames also served
to support the plates in vertical planes by being passed through
holes in a bar of wood placed across the mouth of the vessel.         The
plates were immersed in the solution to a depth of 5 cm., having
their planes parallel and about 1 cm. apart. There were thus
55 sq. cm. of surface of each plate wetted.          To find the polari

sat ion one of Lord Kelvin's quadrant electrometers       was used, and
by an arrangement,     described later, the breaking of the electro
lysing current circuit and the switching of the electrodes on to
the terminals of the electrometer were done simultaneously.      Before
switching as above, however, the needle of the electrometer was
deflected by making a difference of potential between the pairs of
quadrants, and this deflection was so adjusted by trial and error
that, when the electrodes were switched on, the needle was no
farther deflected.   For deflecting the needle of the electrometer a
high resistance slide bridge was used. A difference of potential was
maintained between its two ends, and the difference of potential
between one end and the slider was used to deflect the needle, so
that by moving the slider one way or the other the deflection could
be increased or diminished at will.       The electrolysing current was
kept constant throughout each experiment, being measured by one of
Lord Kelvin's electric balances and adjusted by a rheostat.         One
terminal of the electrometer, one electrode, and one end of the
slide bridge were connected together and then put to earth.         The
current for the electrolysis was   got from eight large secondary cells,
and the difference of potential between the ends of the slide bridge
was maintained by two small secondary cells. The arrangement of
keys can be best understood from the diagram. By pressing the
key k', connexion was made between the slider and the unearthed
quadrants, and when the key k was free, the circuit was complete
for the electrolysing current, but when k was pressed down the circuit
 was broken, and the unearthed electrode was connected to the un
 earthed quadrants.

   The order of an experiment was the following.
   After carefully standardising the electrometer, the electrolysis
was started, and the unearthed electrode connected by a wire (not
shown in the diagram) to the unearthed quadrants. The deflec
tion of the needle thus produced, which showed the difference of
potential between the electrodes, continued to increase steadily until,
after the lapse of an interval of time depending on the strength of
the current, it became constant.     When this stage was reached, the
wire mentioned above was removed and the key k' pressed and kept
down, thus making connexion between the slider and the quadrants.
The slider was then moved along until the deflection was nearly
equal to that which would be given by the polarisation, and the
key k momentarily pressed, thereby breaking the current circuit and
connecting the electrode to the quadrants.      An impulsive deflection
immediately followed, unless the potential of the quadrants was
equal to that of polarisation.  If this deflection was negative (which
indicated that the potential of polarisation was less than that of the
quadrants) the slider was moved so as to reduce the potential of the
quadrants below that of polarisation., thereby making the impulsive

 1893.]          Platinum Electrodes in Sulphuric Acid.                       81
 deflection positive, and then the experiment was continued as below.
  When the positive deflection was obtained its amount was noted, and
 the slider was moved so as to increase the steady deflection nearly up
 to the point on the scale reached by the impulsive one, and another
 trial then made. In this way, by watching the point reached by each
 impulsive deflection, and then increasing the steady one almost up to
 that point, the latter was increased until the former vanished, that is,
 until the potential of the quadrants was that of polarisation. The
 magnitude of this deflection was then noted, and the polarisation
 calculated from it. In these trials the key k was kept down only for
 about two seconds, just sufficient time to allow the extent of the
 deflection to be seen, and at least two minutes were allowed to elapse
 between one   trial and the next.
    After the maximum deflection had been reached, a considerable
 interval of time was allowed to elapse, and then the key k' raised
 and k simultaneously lowered and kept down, and the rate of fall of
 the deflection noted. The above motion of the keys threw the slider
 off and put the electrode on to the quadrants, at the same time
 stopping the current. The deflection was therefore due to polarisa
 tion alone, and its rate of fall was therefore the rate of fall of the
 polarisation.
    The results of one series of experiments are given in the accom
 panying table.
    All the results point to the polarisation being constant with large
electrodes, being independent of the strength of the solution and the
intensity of the current. The variations in the figures do not occur

in exactly similar experiments performed at different times.
    The mean of all the values, of the polarisation in this table is
2-09 volts.
    The rate of fall of the polarisation depends on the time the current
has been electrolysing the solution, and also on its intensity, but in
every case the fall is very rapid at first, being in some cases as much
 in the first minute as it is in the next five minutes, and the fall in
the first minute is never less than one-fourth of the polarisation.

 multiples of 0 are eliminated, and the coefficients of all terms after

    A definition of the unit earthquake having been adopted, the
 earthquakes of different districts are classified in half-monthly groups,
the first half of February containing fourteen days, and of all the
 other months fifteen days ; and the numbers so obtained are reduced
 to intervals of equal length (fifteen days). The numbers for the two
halves of each month are added together.                 The mean of the numbers
 for the six       months    from   November to April gives the six-monthly

 1893.]        A nnual and Semi-annual Seismic Periods.                83
 mean   corresponding to the end of January. Six-monthly means are
 calculated  in this way for the end of each month ; each mean is
 divided by the average of all twelve, and the difference between each
 quotient and unity is multiplied by the augmenting factor l-589, in
 order to obtain the correct value of the ratio a^ : Oq.       The curve
 obtained by plotting these reduced means thus gives special pro
 minence to the annual period, by eliminating the semi-annual      period
 and all those which are fractions of six months, and by diminishing
 the amplitudes of all other periods with respect to that of the annual
 period.
    In investigating the semi-annual period, the numbers corresponding
 to the first halves of January and July are added together, and so
 on; the rest of the method     being the same as for the annual period.
 The result gives special prominence to the semi-annual period by
 eliminating the annual period, and by eliminating or diminishing the
 amplitudes of all periods less than six months.
    Seismic Periodicity in relation to Intensity. — This discussion is
 founded on : (1) lists compiled from Mallet's great catalogue, first,
 of shocks which were so slight as to be just perceptible, and, secondly,
 of those which were strong enough to damage buildings; (2) Pro
fessor Milne's classification of the Japanese earthquakes of 1885 to
 1889 according to the areas distm-bed by them; and (S) different
catalogues relating to the same district, it being obvious that two
such catalogues for the same time can only differ by the omission or
inclusion of slight shocks.
   The following results are obtained : — (1) In both periods, the
amplitude is greater for slight than for strong shocks ; (2) there
appear to be two classes of slight shocks with an annual period, the
stronger having their maximum in winter, the weaker in summer ;
and (3) in the case of the semi-annual period, both strong and slight
shocks, as a rule, have nearly the same maximum epochs.
    Seismic Periodicity in relation to Geographical Position. — The num
ber of records examined is 62, 45 belonging to the northern hemi
sphere, 14 to the southern, and 3 to equatorial countries.
   1. Annual Period. — In every district, and in all but five records
(which are obviously incomplete), there is a fairly well-marked annual
period.     As a rule, different records for the same district agree in
giving the same, or nearly the same, maximum epoch. Excluding,
however, those which disagree in this respect, we have left 34 records
for the northern hemisphere, 9 for the southern, and 2 for equatorial
countries. In the northern hemisphere, 4 records give the maximum
in November, 16 in December, and 6 in January; in the southern
hemisphere, 2 in April, 2 in May, 3 in July, and 2 in August ; the
end of the month being supposed in each case.        As a rule, then, the
maximum epoch occurs in winter in both hemispheres.           The ampli

tude of the annual       period ranges from 0"05 (New Zealand) to 0-67
(Sicily and Algeria), the average of 57 records being 033.
    2. Semi-annual Period. — Of the 62 records examined, only 3 fail
 to show a semi-annual period, the cause of the failure in these cases
being no doubt the imperfection of the seismic record.           In New
Zealand and South-east        Australia, the maximum epoch generally
falls either in February or March and August or September ; in
North America, as a rule, in March or April and September or
October.      But for other regions it does not seem possible as yet to
deduce any law.       The amplitude of the semi-annual period ranges
from 0'06 (southern hemisphere) to 0'79 (Mexico), the average value
being 0'24.
    3. In fifteen cases, the amplitude of the semi-annual period exceeds
that of the annual period.         Eleven of these records include the
following insular districts, which are among the most well-marked
seismic regions in the world, namely, the Grecian Archipelago,
Japan, the Malay Archipelago, New Zealand, and the West Indies.
The average amplitude of the annual period in these eleven cases is
0'16, and that of the semi-annual period 0"24 ; i.e., the average
amplitude of the annual period is just half that for all the districts
examined, while in the case of the semi-annual period the average
amplitudes are the same.
    Origin of the Annual Period. — In this, the concluding, section of
the paper, an attempt is made to show that the annual change in baro
metric pressure may be the cause of the annual change in seismic fre
quency. It -would be difficult to prove that such a connexion exists, but
reasons are given which seem to render it in some degree probable.
    1. The most probable cause of the origin of the majority of non-
volcanic earthquakes is the impulsive friction, due to slipping, of the
two rock-surfaces of a fault. Now, whatever be the causes of
seismic periodicity, it seems probable that they are merely auxiliary,
and determine the epoch when an earthquake shall take place, rather
than there shall be an earthquake at all. Professor G. H. Darwin
has shown that the vertical displacement of the earth's surface by
parallel waves of barometric elevation and depression is not incon
 siderable, and that it diminishes at first very slowly as the depth
 iucreases.    Since the fault-slip which produces even a moderately
 strong shock must be very small, and since the work to be done in such
 a case is, not the compression of solid rock, but the slight depression
 of a fractured mass whose support is nearly, but not quite, withdrawn,
the annual range of barometric pressure does not seem incompetent
 to produce the effects observed.
    2. Comparisons between the dates of the maximum epochs of the
 seismic and barometric annual periods are made in 31 of the districts
 treated in this paper. The seismic maximum approximately coincides

  with the     barometric maximum in 10 districts, and follows it by
 about one     month in 9, and by about two months in 4, districts ; the
 other cases generally admitting of some explanation.
    3. In sevtral insular seismic districts, and especially in Japan and
 New Zealand, the amplitude of the annual period is very small ; and,
 if many of the earthquakes of these districts originate beneath the
 sea, this     should be the case ; for, in the course of a year, as the
 barometric pressure changes, the sea will have time to take up its
 equilibrium position, and thus the total pressure on the sea-bottom
 will be unaltered.

       to Newton's Rings, but exhibited by Waves passing along
        Wires of which a part differs from the rest."                     By Edwin
        H. Barton, B.Sc, "1851 Exhibition" Science Scholar.
        Communicated by Professor A. W. ROCKER, M.A., F.R.S.
       Received May 25, 1893.
   1.   In   1891 Mr.   V. Bjerknes* showed             how to measure     the wave
length     and primary damping of the electrical oscillations in a
Hertzian primary conductor by the use of a special electrometer and
long parallel wires along which induced oscillations were propagated.
This form of Hertzian secondary conductor, in which the wires are
far too long to be in resonance with the primary oscillator, may,
hereafter in this paper, be referred to as
                                                          " the long               " or
                                                                       secondary
simply
           "  the secondary."
   2. During the following session Heir von Geitlerf found that, if
the wires at any part of the long secondary were either
   (1) Replaced by others thicker              or thinner than the normal wires,
          or
   (2)    Arranged     nearer    together     or further apart than the normal
          distances,
then in any      of these cases, a partial reflection of the electrical waves
occurred      at such place of change in the wires.
    Herr von Geitler then made further observations of what occurred
when a condenser        was attached at a single point of each wire, but did
not    quantitatively examine the effect produced on the waves by a
finite length of the secondary being different from the rest.

experimentally, the relation between the length of this abnormal

part of the

    5.   Imagine an electrical conductor ABCD (see fig. 1) consisting of
 three parts, AB, BC, and CD, in each of which parts the electrostatic
 capacity and other properties of the conductor remain constant,
those of the third part CD being precisely like those of the first part
AB, but the second part BC differing from the other two parts
either in its own dimensions or in the nature of the dielectric* by
which it is surrounded, or in both these respects.
   And consider an electrical wave passing along this conductor from
A towards D. Suppose its amplitude in the part AB is a, and that
from the point B (immediately after the instant of incidence of the
wave there and before any disturbance has reached C), a wave of
amplitude ah is reflected towards A, and a wave of amplitude ac
transmitted within the part BC towards C.                     The constants b and c
may be referred to as the coefficients of reflection and transmission re
spectively.
    6. Then the elementary mathematical investigation of what may
be expected to occur falls naturally into three parts, namely : —
    (1) The derivation of the coefficients of reflection and transmission
at the point B from the changes in the properties of the conductor
which occur there.
    (2) The relation between these coefficients and the similar ones
involved when the wave reaches C and thus encounters the reverse
change      in the properties of the conductor.
    (3) The determination of the intensities of the total disturbances
reflected at or passing through B in the direction A and of those
transmitted through C in the direction D respectively, each being the
result of an infinite series of interfering waves produced by multiple
reflections within the part BC, these again being produced by the
original wave passing along AB.
    These three branches of the theory will now be taken in the above
order.

parU     of the conductor is supposed to   be a dielectric.  All idea of its possessing
appreciable conductivity,      and  consequently absorbing   a sensible portion of the
energy of the wave, is excluded from this theory. Also for all parts of the con
ductor itself let to (the magnetic permeability) = unity.

    Farther, remembering that                     i = Qx( + u)         = C0 x ( + u), we have

    11.  Now take B, the junction of the two parts of the conductor, as
 the origin of abscissae.            Then, for x = 0, we have 0i = 02 and t, = i, ;
 unless 80/2b and dijdx become infinite at that point.                                Applying this
 relation to equations (4), (5), (6), and (7) yields

  It will thus be seen that the damping just referred to in the head
ing of this paragraph is the primary damping, that          the time-rate   is,
of decrease of the oscillations occurring in the Hertzian primary
conductor.    Secondary damping, on the other hand, refers to the
space-rate of decrease of any individual wave as   proceeds along the
                                                                    it
Hertzian secondary conductor. It is, of course, along the long form
of this secondary conductor that we are now supposing the waves to
travel, but the secondary damping     known to be small in comparison
                                                   is
with the primary damping, and is, therefore, in the present part of
the theory, legitimately neglected.*
   16. It will readily be seen that the ordinary mathematical treat
ment of the interference of light in thin plates will not strictly apply
to this case.
   For, in the optical phenomenon, one supposes a continuous beam of
light of constant amplitude. We may, therefore, in that case, at
once   take, to infinity, the sums of the series of reflected and trans
 mitted rays to which the original one gives rise, and neglect the com
 paratively small period which elapses before those two infinite series are
made up, and during which (the series being as yet incomplete) the
reflected and transmitted beams have not reached their final steady
 valnes.
   But with such primary damping as that with which we have to do
 (namely, of the order 7, = 2w*//3 = 0-5), the character of the result
would be essentially changed by the unwarrantable assumption that
 the amplitude of the incident wave remains sensibly constant until
the infinite series of internal reflections has taken place.
   17. The question          therefore attacked by forming a series of
                               is
integrals.

  1 m. long, several with the condenser 2 m. long, and so forth ; check
 observations    being taken while the condenser is being shortened
 again.     Curve No. 2 is plotted with condenser lengths as abscissae,
 and electrometer throws as ordinates ; these latter, however, being
 reduced to the scale, electrometer throws without condenser equals
 unity. They thus compai-e with the values of If/I0 in curve No. 1.
 The wave-length used was \i = 9 m.
     23. It is seen that the experimental curve thus obtained agrees in
 its general form with that plotted from theoretical considerations.
 Exact coincidence of theory and experiment cannot at this stage be
 expected.     I  have, accordingly, made no attempt to plot a carve
from equation (18) with values of the constants which profess to
exactly represent those involved in the experiment.
     24. I am aware of two chief sources of disturbances in the experi
 mental conditions, but have already shown that they are not of such
order as to invalidate the above results, which, therefore, hold good
as first approximations.
     25. As the present paper is only a preliminary one, intended to
give an outline of the theory and experiment, I will not now enlarge
upon the topic of disturbances. I am still engaged on these inter
ference phenomena, and hope to publish a full account of the results
next session.
     In conclusion, I  wish to express my great indebtedness to Professor
Hertz, both for first directing my attention to the subject of these
reflections, and also for his invaluable advice in the course of the
work.

    In  the spring of 1889 Professor J. J. Thomson published* a descrip
tion of some experiments made by him for comparing the resistances
of electrolytes to the passage of very rapidly alternating currents, the
method consisting in comparing the thicknesses of layers of different
electrolytes which were equally opaque to Hertzian radiation. During

 more    completely       analogous to Hughes' induction balance.               The

    Let ASA' be a Hertz exciter, and B, B' secondary conductors similar
to the primary from which a pair of long wires, stretched parallel to
each other, are led off for a considerable distance.               One may regard
the wires simply as guides for the radiation, which then travels
straight up the space between them.             If we run these wires for a cer
tain length, I, through an electrolyte, the radiation will have to traverse
this and will be partly absorbed.          If an electrometer be connected at
E, a quarter wave-length from the bridge at the end of the wires,
readings taken with various thicknesses of electrolyte should, accord
ing to my expectations, give a logarithmic curve, from which the
specific resistance would be at once calculable.

    The wires B, F, D, about       1 mm. diameter, were spanned 6 cm. apart.
If  these wires be made too short, a wave-train emitted from B, B' may
reach the electrolyte zu or the bridge D, be reflected, and return to B
before the primary has practica lly done oscillating.             If this occur, the
state of the secondary may affect the primary as in an alternate
current transformer.          If, however, Hxi be made longer than half the
effective length of the wave- train, the reflected waves will not reach
B until the primary oscillations have practically come to rest, and
under these circumstances the latter will know nothing about any
alternations in the secondary at or beyond xt. This reaction of the

     In the actual apparatus the wires were at F, run out through a
  window in a loop of about 50 m. circumference round the labora
  tory garden.     They re-entered the room at F, and were then run ver
 tically through the vessel for containing the electrolyte. The circuit
  was completed by another loop, FaF4, 50 m. long, round the garden,
 re-entering the room at F4, connecting to the electrometer at E, and
  bridged at D, 2-25 m. =       |\   from the electrometer.       According to the
 researches of Bjerknes (loc. cit.) these dimensions should be sufficient,
  with the present apparatus, to prevent any sensible reaction.
     The electrometer was the same one as that used by Bjerknes in his
 researches in the same laboratory.          It is a simple quadrant electro
 meter with only one pair of quadrants and an uncharged aluminium
 needle of the usual shape suspended by a quartz fibre. One quadrant.
 is connected to each wire. The needle taking no account of sign,
 elongations   are simply proportional to the time integral of the
 energy : first throws, not steady deflections, are read.
    Various glass jars were used for holding the electrolyte.           The wires
 were run vertically through holes drilled in the bottom of the jar, into
 which they were cemented.
    Several trials were made of this apparatus with dilute solutions of
copper sulphate. Readings were taken in pairs alternately, with no
solution in the jar and with some given thickness ; usually about ten
readings at each point. The ratio of the transmitted intensities so
obtained was determined for several points and plotted as a curve.
Some 5 or 6 cm. of electrolyte was the maximum, thickness that could
be used in these first experiments.         The curves so obtained for these
badly-conducting solutions always differed sensibly from the log
arithmic, and the more so the more the solution was diluted.               If the
mean log. dec. over the whole thickness was taken, the corresponding
value of the specific conductivity appeared extremely high.
    It appeared likely that these irregularities might be due to inter
ference effects analogous to Newton's rings (by transmission), or the
                   " thin plates," particularly in view of the results ob
phenomena of
tained just previously by Mr. E. H. Barton in the same laboratory.

mena over as great      a thickness of electrolyte as the absorption would
permit of using.       Distilled water offered itself naturally as the best
electrolyte for this purpose.
    For the containing vessel a glass cylinder 114 cm. high was used ;
the internal diameter varied somewhat, but was about 12 cm. at the
uarrowpst.

    With this apparatus a series of observations were made for various
 thicknesses of distilled water. To cover, as far as possible, irregular
 ities in sparking, readings were now taken in pairs alternately at the
 point to be determined and some other point taken for the time as the
 standard ; it would have caused too great delay, and consequent
 irregularity in the effectiveness of the sparks, were all the water to
 be siphoned out between each pair of readings.       As before, ten or
 twelve readings were usually taken at each point.       The throw ob
 tained with no liquid was also always taken as unity.
    As a specimen of the usual spark variations, the following series of
 reading's for the determination of the throw with 55 cm. water with

   The uncertainty due to this stray field might be easily avoided in
one way, namely, by making one wire into a tube surrounding the
other and using this tube also as the jar for the electrolyte. This was,
in fact, the arrangement originally intended to be adopted. Several
disadvantages attended           it,
                            however, and led to its final rejection in
favour of the simple wires and glass jar. First, such a condenser
reflects under all circumstances a considerable portion of the incident
energy.*    Secondly, the variation of the position of the top surface
of the electrolyte relatively to the top of the jar would introduce
fresh interference phenomena.    This appeared directly from the work
of Mr. Barton to which have already had occasion to refer. Lastly,

       M.Sc. (Vict.), B.A. (Camb.), Scholar and Coutts-Trotter
       Student of Trinity College, Cambridge. Communicated by

                                        (Abstract.)
   The experiments were undertaken to find whether the internal
energy of the molecules of organic gases, as deduced from the ratio
of the specific heats, showed any regularities corresponding to the
chemical resemblances symbolised by the graphic formulas.
   The paraffins and their monohalogen derivatives are very suitable
for the purpose, as their chemical relations to each other are simple,
they are easily volatile, and are stable enough to be unaffected by
ordinary purifying agents.
  From the ratio of the specific heats we can calculate the relative
rates of increase of the internal energy and the energy of translation
of the molecules per degree rise of temperature, and, the aim of the
experiments being to compare the rates of increase of the internal
energy of different gases,      was decided to keep the translational
                                       it
energy constant by working at a constant temperature.             Con
sequently   the  determinations  were all made   at the temperature of
the room.
   The ratio of the specific heats was calculated from the velocity of

 south!    in the gases.This was determined by Kundt's method, using
 a    double-ended form of apparatus, in all essential features the same
 as   that described in   Pogg. Ann.,' vol. 135. The tube in which the
                             '
  dust figures were made was 125 cm. long and 26 mm. in diameter,
  which Kundt showed to be great enough to avoid any lowering of
  the velocity of sound from the influence of the walls of the tube.
     Lycopodium was used for forming the figures in the hydrocarbons
 and in methyl and ethyl chlorides, but in the heavier gases                      it
 became sticky, and would not move readily, so for these silica was used.
     To measure the figures a piece of apparatus was constructed, con
 sisting of a pair of parallel platinum wires, carried by a framework
 which slides along      steel scale graduated to millimetres.
                            a                                   The tube
 was placed on \/-shaped supports, parallel to the scale, and between
 the wires, which were so adjusted that their plane passed through the
 centre of the nodes.      The position of the framework was then read
on the scale, tenths  of  a  millimetre being estimated with the help of
 a lens.   With figures of average quality the setting of the wires
 could be repeated so as to agree within two or three tenths of a
 millimetre.   The greatest divergence of the observed length of any
one figure from the mean of the series was usually about five or six
tenths of a millimetre.
    The calculation of the l-atio of the specific heats from the velocity
of sound requires the density of the gas to be known, a circumstance
which makes the method very sensitive to small amounts of impnrity
in the material.
    Begnault's value of the density was used for methane, and every
precaution was taken to secure pure gas. Two methods of preparation
were used, Gladstone and Tribe's, by the action of the copper-zinc
couple on methyl iodide and alcohol, and Frankland's, by the action
of zinc methyl on water. After each experiment an analysis of the
gas was made to test its purity and to determine the amount of air
present, for which a correction was made.
    The ethane was prepared by the action of zinc ethyl on water, and
for   it the theoretical density calculated from the molecular weight
was used.
   For the preparation of propane, isopropyl iodide was reduced by
zinc and hydrochloric acid, and the gas was freed from air by lique
faction in    freezing mixture of ether and solid carbonic acid, after
              a
passing through fuming sulphuric acid and potash, and over 30 grams
of palladium.
   Methyl and ethyl chlorides were prepared in the usual way, by
passing hydrochloric acid into a boiling solution of zinc chloride in
the corresponding alcohol, and purified by redistillation through

   The vapour densities of propane and all the halogen compounds
were determined at various pressures for the material as it was used
in the velocity of sound experiment, thus avoiding to a great extent
any error arising from impurity.
                                      Fig. 1.
    The apparatus used for this purpose is shown in fig. 1. Before
joining the parts together, the tube CD is calibrated, and after it han
been attached, but before the side tnbes are fixed on, the volume of
the  whole is determined      by filling with water and weighing. Then,
from the calibration of      CD,   the volume is known between A and a
file mark at K.
    A  weighed quantity of the liquefied gas whose vapour density is
required is sealed up in a small tube with capillary ends, and intro
duced at D, and, by inclining the apparatus, ia made to slide over the
bend and rest at M. The end D is then closed with a cork, and the
apparatus exhausted through the three-way tap         Gr, on the completion
of which operation mercury is allowed to flow in from the reservoir
H, and the tap E is opened. The difference of the levels of the
mercury in the two tubes is read with a cathetomcter, and, subtracted
from the height of the barometer, gives the pressure of the residual
air. On tilting the apparatus, the tube slides over into the wider
 part, and the end breaks off, allowing the liquid to evaporate.         By
 reading the levels again we get the pressure of the gas, and knowing
 its weight and volume, we have all the materials required for calcu
 lating its specific gravity.

   In the experiments the reservoir was always adjusted so that the
level of the mercury in CD stood near the mark at K, thus simpli
fying the calculations a little.
   The apparatus was found to give values of the vapour density
concordant to about one part in 1000.
   The formula used in calculating the ratio of the specific heats was

   These groups are —
                       I.  Methane.
                      II.  The three methyl compounds.
                     III.  Ethane and its derivatives.
                     IV.    Propane and its derivatives.
    If the members of a group have the same ratio of the specific heats,
we know, from a well-known equation in the kinetic theory of gases,
that the ratio of the internal energy absorbed by the molecule to the
total energy absorbed, per degree rise of temperature, is the same for
all. Hence we have the result that, with the single exception of
marsh gas, the compounds with similar formulae have the same
energy-absorbing power, a result which supplies a link of a kind
much needed to connect the graphic formula of a gas with the
dynamical properties of its molecules.
    From the conclusion we have reached, it follows with a high
degree of probability that the atoms which can be interchanged with
out effect on the ratio of the specific heats have themselves the same
energy-absorbing power, their mass and other special peculiarities
being of no consequence.            Further, the anomalous behaviour of
methane confirms what was clear from previous determinations,
namely, that the number of atoms in the molecule is not in itself
sufficient to fix the distribution of energy, and suggests that perhaps
the configuration is the sole determining cause.
    If this is so, it follows that ethane and propane have the same con
 figuration as their monohalogen derivatives, but that methane differs
from the methyl compounds, a conclusion that in no way conflicts
with the symmetry of the graphic formulas of methane and its
derivatives, for this is a symmetry of reactions, not of form.

   Theorem.
   29. Since the series A and B are particular cases of the general
formula (77), Part I, or of
                                         B
by taking   r=   0 and   r=   \ respectively, it may be desirable to find
the general formula of which the series C is a particular case. Notice,
in passing, the shorter notation employed in (11). It is certainly easier
to see the meaning of a series by inspecting the written-out formula
containing several terms, when one is not familiar with the kind of
series concerned.      As soon, however, as one gets used to the kind of
formula, the writing out of several terms becomes first needless, and
then tiresome.       The short form (11) is then sufficient.            One term
only  is written,   with the  summation    sign  before  it.    The  other terms
are got by changing r with unit step always, and both ways.                  The
value of r is arbitrary, though of course it should have the same value
in every term so far as the fractional part is concerned, so that, in
 (11), r may be changed to any other number without affecting its
truth. Similarly, the exponential formula may be written
                                    ^  =                                     (12)

the former, and comparing the extreme forms.                               Thus, calling u the

provided n is not a negative integer, when we know that closer ex
amination is required.
      Apparent Failure of Numerical Equivalence in certain       Cases.
   34. Now, although the equations following (35), (36) (excepting
(43)) are deducible from them by the process used immediately and
without trouble, there is considerable difficulty in finding out their
meaning.       Considering (37) and (38),        I  knew that in the case
w = — 1 the equivalence was satisfactory all round, though not very
understandable.       When n is 0, or integral, it is also satisfactory, for
then we have merely a perversion of terms in passing from u to v.
But when     I  tried the case n = — ^, and subjected it to numerical
calculation, with the expectation of finding numerical equivalence to
the extent permitted by the initial convergence of the divergent
series, I found a glaring discrepancy between « and v.        Furthermore,
on taking n    = —1, we produce
                                                                        (44)

which also do not show any numerical equivalence.           I was therefore
led to think that the equivalence in the case of the Fourier- Beseel
function was due to some peculiarity of that function, and it is a fact
that the function is the meeting-place of many remarkabilities.          The
matter was therefore put on one side for the time. But, more
recently, independent evidence in other directions showed me that
there was no particular reason to expect such a complete failure.
 And, in fact, on returning to the discrepant calculations relating to
n = — ^,    I  found an important numerical error.         When corrected,
 the results for u and v agreed as fairly as could be expected.

   Of course with such a small value of x, we cannot expect more
than a very rough agreement, because the convergence of the v series

Thus we have practically gone over the ground from n = — £ to = 1
with good results, so far as the limited examples are concerned, and
there can he, so far, scarcely a doubt of the existence of numerical equi
valence, in the same sense as before with respect to the ascending and
descending series for the Fourier-Bessel function. It remains to examine
cases between n = —             \
                          and — 1. This is important on account of the
complete failure in the latter case of the numerical equivalence when
estimated in the above manner.       From the already shown indeter-
minateness of the binomial expansion when n — — 1, we have the
suggestion of a partial explanation, because we should arrive at the
form au + bv, where a + b = 1. But there remains the fact in
dicated that the extreme forms of the binomial expansion               are
equivalent, so that we should expect w and v to be equivalent. Since,
however, the numerical equivalence of the different forms of (l + a-)"
becomes very unsatisfactory when n is or is near —1, so we should
not be surprised to find that the unsatisfactoriness becomes empha
sized in the case of u and v.    Such is, in fact, the case.

 What is the Meaning of Equivalence t Sketch of Gradual Development
   of Ideas concerning Equivalence and Divergent Series (up to § 49).
   43. In the preceding,     I   have purposely avoided giving any de
finition of " equivalence."     Believing in example rather than precept,
I have preferred to let the formulae, and the method of obtaining
them, speak for themselves.         Besides that, I could not give a satis
factory definition which I could feel sure would not require subse
quent revision.       Mathematics is an experimental science, and
definitions do not come first, but later on. They make themselves,
when the nature of the subject has developed itself. It would be
absurd to lay down the law beforehand.         Perhaps, therefore, the best
thing    I  can do is to describe briefly several successive stages of
knowledge relating to equivalent and divergent series, being approxi
mately representative of personal experience.
   (a). Complete ignorance.
   (6). A convergent series has a limit, and therefore a definite
value. A divergent series, on the contrary, is of infinite value, of
course. So all solutious of physical problems must be in finite terms
or in convergent series. Otherwise nonsense is made.

   44.   (c). Eye-opening.   But in some physical problems divergent
series   are actually used     for calculation.     A notable example is
Stokes's divergent formula for the oscillating function Jn(x). He
showed that the error was less than the last term included. Now

122                       Mr. 0. Heaviside.                    [June   15,
series of this kind have the terms alternately positive and negative.
This seems to give a clue to the numerical meaning.    The terms get
bigger and bigger, but the alternation of sign prevents the assump
tion of an infinite value, either positive or negative.   It is possible to
imagine & finite quantity split up into parts alternately positive and
negative, and of successively increasing magnitude (after a certain
point, for example). It is a bad arrangement of parts, certainly, but
understandable    roughly by the initial convergence.      So the use of
alternating divergent series may be justified by numerical convenience
in an approximate calculation of the value of the function.
   But, by the same reasoning, a direct divergent series, with all terms
of one sign, is of infinite value, and therefore out of court. It cannot
have a finite value, and cannot be the solution of a physical problem
involving finite values. This seems to be what Boole meant in his
remark on p. 475 of his ' Differential Equations (3rd edition) :— " It
                                                    '
is known that in the employment of divergent series an important
distinction exists between the cases in which the terms of the series
are ultimately all positive, and alternately positive and negative.      In
the latter case we are, according to a known law, permitted to employ
that portion of the series which is convergent for the calculation of
the entire value." He proceeded to exemplify this by Petzval's in
tegrals.   The argument is equivalent to this. Change the sign of x
in the Series C, equation (3) above. Let the result be C. Then we
must use the Series C when x is positive, and C when x is negative.
 This amounts to excluding the direct divergent series altogether, and
using only the alternating. That is, we have one solution, not two.
                                                        "
 Professor Boole did not say what the " known law was. His above
 authoritative rejection of direct divergent series led me away from the
truth for many years. The plausibility of the argument is evident, as
 evident as that the value of a direct divergent series is infinity.
              Divergent Series as Differentiating Operators.
  45. (d). Later on, divergent series presented themselves            in an
entirely different manner.    In
                               the solution of physical problems by
means of differentiating or analytical operators, the operators them
selves may be either convergent, or alternatingly divergent, or directly
divergent. That     is, they are so when regarded algebraically, with a
diffei-entiator regarded as a quantity. When the operations indicated
by the operator are carried out upon    function of the variable, the
                                        a
solution of the problem arises, and in convergent form. Here, then,
                                        a
we have the secret of the direct divergent series at last. It nume
                                                                 is
rically meaningless, when considered algebraically, with a quantity
and its powers involved.     But analytically considered, the questiou
of divergency does not arise. The proper use of divergent series    as is

1893.]             On Operators in    Physical Mathematics.              123
analytical operators to obtain convergent algebraical solutions.         The
series C and C above referred to are then truly the two independent
solutions of a certain      differential equation,    and neither should be
rejected,   for they are natural companions.
     Disappearance of the Distinction between Direct and Alternating
                                Divergent Series.
   46. (e). But, still pursuing the subject along the same lines, this
view is soon found to be imperfect.         For a given operator leading to
a convergent solution       one way may lead to a divergent solution by
another.      Or it may lead to the same algebraical function by diverse
ways.     These and other considerations show that divergent series,
even when continuously divergent, must be considered             numerically
as well as algebraically and analytically.         But in the analytical use
of a direct or continuously divergent series every term must be used,
if the result is a convergent series. Yet it is plain that we cannot count
the whole divergent series numerically, because it has no limit.         And
on examination      we find that the initial convergent part of the con
tinuously divergent series gives the value of the function in the same
sense as an alternatingly divergent series.           In the latter case, we
come nearest to the value by stopping at the smallest term, where
the oscillation is least.     If we now make all terms positive, so that
the series is continuoasly divergent, and treat it in the same way,
and stop when the addition made by a fresh term is the smallest,
we come near the true value.
    We now seem to have something like a distinct theory of divergent
series.    The supposed distinction between the alternating and the
continuous divergent series has disappeared.          Analytical equivalence
of two series, one convergent, the other divergent, may require all
terms in the divergent one to be counted.             Numerical equivalence
exists also, but is governed     by the  initial convergency.

 importance in mathematical physics.           But, again, further examina

 explain the meaning and origin of equivalent series, we are led to a
 theory of generalized differentiation, involving the inverse factorial
 as a completely continuous function both ways, and to methods of
 multiplying equivalent forms to any extent, and in a generalized

the   general   results. We also come to confirm the idea we have
recognized that equivalence may be understood in three distinct senses,
viz., analytical, algebraical, and numerical.    The first use made by me
of equivalent series, one of which is continuously divergent, was
analytical only. The second use was numerical. The third is alge
braical, through the generalized algebraical theorems.         We also see
that equivalence does not necessarily         or usually mean identity,
Thus the series A, B, C are analytically, algebraically, and numeri
cally equivalent with x positive.         But they are not algebraically
identical.     The identity is given by C = £(A + B). This point is
rather important in some transformations, and explains some pre
viously inexplicable peculiarities. Thus, the series A is real whether
x be real or a pure imaginary.       In the latter case, we get the oscil
lating function J0(«), the original Fourier cylinder function. But
the equivalent series C becomes complex by the same transformation.
The above-mentioned        identity explains it. The second solution of
the oscillating kind is brought in, as will appear a little later (§ 70).
Partial Failure of Interpretation of Numerical Value of Divergent Series
        by Initial Convergence.    Further Explanation yet required.
   48. (g). But whilst we thus greatly extend our views concerning
divergent series, the question of numerical equivalence, which just
now in (/) seemed to be about settled, becomes again obscured.        The
property that the value of a divergent series, including the con
tinuously divergent, may be estimated by the initially convergent
part, is a very valuable one. But the property is not generally true,
and, in fact, sometimes fails in a very marked manner. We must,
therefore, reserve for the present the question of numerical equiva
lence in general, and let the explanation evolve itself in course of
time.    If definitely understandable numerical equivalence of series
were imperative under all circumstances, then I am afraid that the
study of the subject would be of doubtful value.        But the matter has
not this limited range, a very important application of divergent
series being their analytical use, which is free from the numerical
difficulty.   For example, the extreme forms of the binomial theorem
may, when considered numerically equivalent, be utterly useless. Yet
they may be employed to lead to other series, either convergent, or it
may bo divergent, but with a satisfactory initial convergence con
trasting with the original. Note that the series may sometimes take
the form of definite integrals, apparently of infinite or of indefinite
value.    In any case we should not be misled by apparent unintel-
ligibility to ignore the subject. That is not the way to get on. We
have seen the error fallen into by Boole and others on the subject of
divergent series. It is not so long ago, either, since mathematicians

of  the highest repute conld not see the validity of investigations based
upon the use of the algebraic imaginary.                     The results reached were,
according to them, to be regarded as suggestive merely, and required
proof by methods not involving the imaginary.                         But familiarity has
bred contempt, and at the present day the imaginary is a generally
used     powerful engine, which I should think most mathematicians
consider can be trusted (if well treated) to give valid proofs, though
it certainly does need cautious treatment sometimes, and perhaps
auxiliary aid.*

When x =       2  we get       13203    -  06903    =   06300.
When x =       3  we get       1-6888 —    l- 1098  =   05790.
So with x =       3 the error is about       fhs only.       The usual formula

exceedingly obscure to me until lately.              Thus (157) and (156) are
usually   reckoned     to bo   companion      solutions  (unless as regards the
numerical factor). But if we take q = si in (157), the function
remains    real,    and becomes       the   oscillatory function,    the   original
cylinder function of Fourier.           Thus

We know that H0(ga;) and 21<,(qx) are equivalent, both analytically and
numerically.         Why, then, does the first become complex, whilst the
second remains real when we take q = si ? They cannot be both true
in changed form.           Thus (152) becomes (doing it in detail)

 That is, using the functions (162), (163) Again, we have the trans

 whereas       210(2x)     becomes     2J0(«aj).  This was formerly        a   perfect
 mystery, indicative of an imperfection in the theory of the Bessel
 functions. But the reader who has gone through Part                 I  and §§ 27, 28
 of Part     II   will have little trouble in understanding the meaning of
  (167).     The functions H0 and 2Io, though equivalent (with positive
 argument), are not algebraically identical.                To have identity we
 require    to   use  a second   equivalent   form,  so that,  as in § 28,

  In this form we may take            q  = si, and still have agreement         in the
  changed form.         We obtain the relation (167), provided that
                                                                                 (169)
   As   I mentioned before in § 22, this formula for Go(«») may be de
  duced from formulae in Lord Rayleigh's ' Sound,' derived by a method
  due to Lipschitz, which investigation, however,                  I  find it rather
   difficult to  follow.
      We   have, therefore,     three principal forms of the first solution with
   q real  and positive,     viz., I„(qx), \H0(qx), and the intermediate form
   (168). We have also three forms of the oscillatory function G0(saO,
   viz., (161), (163), and (169). But we have only employed two forms

an additional principal formula for K^ga), and another for J0(sx), not
yet investigated.

Bat, in the transition from (171) to (170) by the relation q = si, it is
indifferent whether we take H0(gx) = 2\0(qx) = 2j0(sa;), or else =
Jo(sx) — iG0(sx). This conjugate property is of some importance in
the treatment of cylindrical problems by the operators.

Here   it should  be understood   that either v or q may be passive,    when
it may    be regarded   as a constant.    But when both are active, there
are two independent       operands, one for v and the other for q.       In a
cylinder problem relating     to elastic waves, we  may   regard  v as being

 time, and v the speed of propagation.      We have

        Products of the Intensity of the Light acting and of the

        C.B., F.R.S.   Received June 13, 1893.
   It has been generally assumed   that when the products of the intensity
of light acting    on a sensitive surface and the time of exposure are
eqnai    similar amounts of chemical action are produced, and with the
ordinary exposures and intensities of light employed such, no doubt,
is practically the case, and any methods of measurement hitherto
practicable have been insufficiently delicate to discover any departure
from this     law,   if   such departure existed.                  In   some recent experiments

144                       Capt. \V. de \V. Abney.               [June  15,
however,    I have discovered    that this law breaks down under certain
                  I
conditions, and think the fact worthy the attention of those interested
in the subject, since it is possible that these conditions may arise
with other experimenters.        Quite lately 1 have described the method
of comparing the photographic value of sunlight with that of candle
light ('Photographic Journal,' June, 1893), which was as follows: —
A beam of sunlight, after three reflections from plain glass mirrors,
was admitted through a narrow slit to sensitive bromide paper
stretched round a drum of about 4 inches in diameter. The drum
could be caused to rotate round its axis at any speed up to about
sixty revolutions per second, by means of an electro-motor. A
small exposure with this light was given to the paper during the
rotation of the cylinder. Subsequently an amyl acetate lamp was placed
in position at any convenient distance from the same slit, and a fresh
portion of the same sensitive paper exposed to its action during a
much longer period, the rotation being continued as before.        The slit
was next replaced by a small square aperture, of some £ inch side, and
further portions of the same paper exposed to the amyl acetate light
at the same distance, for varying but known exposures, with the drum
at rest. On development the paper showed three images, a narrow
band of deposit of the width of the siit caused by the sunlight, a
second band of the same width due to the light from the amyl
acetate lamp, and a third row of squares of varying blackness of
deposit due to the different exposures given with the drum at rest.
   If the width of the slit be accurately measured, the band formed
by the amyl acetate lamp is evidently superfluous, supposing the
usually accepted law to hold good under all circumstances, as by
measuring the blackness, or rather want of whiteness, of the different
 squares, and using them as ordinates to the abscissas which were the
times of exposure, and drawing a curve through them, the blackness
 produced by the sunlight could be referred to that produced by
 the light of the amyl acetate lamp, and its equivalent value in
terms of the latter light be calculated.     The band of deposit produced
 by the amyl acetate lamp was introduced as a check, for its black
 ness could also be referred to the curve, and the width of the slit
 be calculated from it.     On making such calculations I was surprised
 to find that in every case the calculated width of the slit was always
 considerably less than what it was in reality, the difference being far
 beyond that which would be caused by any error in the measui-e-
 ment.    This led me to commence an investigation into the cause of
 this difference, and what has already been carried out is sufficient to
 show that there is a failure in the usually accepted law.       It may be
 pointed  out  that if it  held good  the sum  of any number of very short
 exposures should be equivalent to a single exposure lor the same
 length of time.

     The experiment which naturally suggested itself was to expose a
 sensitive surface to the action of the light of an am yl acetate lamp
 passing through a Blit as before, the drum on which it was stretched
 being caused to rotate at high and low speeds, and also to place on
 the same paper a scale of exposures with the drum at rest.       These
 were all developed together.     An example    of  one of many experi
 ments is given as an illustration.
    The circumference of the drum with the paper stretched round
 it was 12-25 in. The width of the slit was arranged to be 0'012 in.
 The amyl acetate lamp was placed 2 ft. from the slit, and a rotation
 of 30 per sec. was given to the drum for one exposure and 1 per sec.
 for a second exposure.   In the first case the time of exposure during
 each     revolution was      —-- x -_ sec, or about         1/30,000 sec.
     The sum      of the exposures during 20 min. was thus T176                  sec.
     In   the   other case the exposure was
                              ——   -   ,   or about 1/1000 sec,
 and the sum of the exposures was, as before, 1'176 sec. Thus the first-
 individual exposures had only                    ,,',-,
                                      of the duration of the second
 exposures, though in the aggregate they were the same.
   A scale of blackness was made on the same paper, through   square
                                                                                 $, a
aperture, withont shifting the lamp, the exposures being                    £,      \,   1,   2,

           8   On developing      was apparent to the eye that the
                                             it
first band was much lighter than the second. The scale and blackness
 of the bands were measured accurately, and the times of exposure
 which had been given to each band, on the assumption that the law
 enunciated held good, were calculated and found to be for the first
 band 0'6 sec, and for the second band 0-91 sec, instead of 1'176 sec.
which was really given in all. Another example            where the slit
                                                                       is
was opened to O'll in., and the time of exposure reduced from 20 to
10 min.     It was found that in this case the exposures given on the
same assumption were 3-7 sec. and 5'28 sec, the real exposure given
being 5-36 sec. The last experiment shows that          the slit had been
                                                                  if
slightly wider or the rotation slower the law would have been
approximately obeyed.
   Another experiment was made by throwing an image of the crater
of the positive pole of the electric light on hole bored in plate
                                                            a                       a

beam to fall on the slit and paper, the drum being made to rotate as
before. The same kind of results were obtained.
   As it might be thought that this difference was caused by some
action other than chemical, another series of experiments was nnder-
taken.     In these different sensitive surfaces were employed in order

to eliminate    any possibility of the effect being due to any phosphor
escence   of the paper, though none could be detected.        Plates were
held stationary and exposures made by admitting light to portions
of them through slits of known angular aperture, cut in a disc which
could be rotated at any desired speed. Similar results were obtained
to those already     described.   The quickest rotation gave the least
density.    It  may be remarked that the more sensitive a surface is to
radiation the less mavked are the differences observable for the same
speeds of rotation.     This is what might be expected.
    As an outcome of the experiments so far made, it seems that when
 exposures less than 1/1000 sec. are made on a sensitive surface, and
the source of illumination is an amyl acetate lamp (Von Altneck's)
placed   1 ft. from the sensitive surface, the law quoted ante fails.
    The question of a very low intensity of light acting and of the
sensitiveness to different spectrum colours is now occupying my
attention.
                        Addendum.       July  4, 1893.
    Since the above paper was read     I  have made an investigation into
the question as to whether the foregoing law fails when feeble inten
sities of light are acting, and find that it does so signally.    Sensitive
surfaces were exposed in a Spurge sensitometer, in which there are
thirty graduations of light admitted to different parts of the surface
at the same time, the intensity of light being vanjed by its admission
through apertures of varying size. The smallest aperture used was
 1/256 of the largest, and an exposure lasting 2650 sec. was given
to the former, whilst 10 sec. was given to the latter.             It was
found    that  the  blackness   produced by the two was very different,
that produced by the light passing through the small aperture corre
sponding to an area of 1/600 of that passing through the largest
aperture, if the law held good.          The light employed was a large
illuminated    surface, which   was equal to one amyl acetate lamp placed
6£ in. away from the surface, without passing through the sensito
meter.
    As some persons might doubt the accuracy of this method, a
different mode of experimenting was adopted in the next series made.
 An amyl acetate lamp was used, and portions of a sensitive surface
 were exposed at different distances from it, on the assumption that
 the squares of the distances gave a measure of the exposures neces
sary in order to produce equality of chemical action.       In one experi
ment exposures were made at distances of 2, 4. 8, 12, 16, 20, and
24 ft. ; the duration of exposure at 2 ft. being 10 sec, whilst for the
last it was 24 min.         The intermediate exposures were calcnlated
on the samtj principle, a scale of blackness was also made by exposing1

     other parts for different times at a fixed distance from the light. As
     a result it was found that, on development, the deposit was greatest
    when the exposure had been made at 2 ft. and diminished for each
    successive distance.         By applying the measures of the different
    blacknesses obtained at the different distances to the curve obtained
    by the measurement of the scale of exposures, it was found that the
    exposure at 24 ft. ought to have been prolonged by 4"3 times to
    give the same blackness as that at 2 ft., the other distances giving
    intermediate results. If the law held good, the actual blackness of
    deposit at 24 ft. would have been obtained had the same exposure
    been given at about 50 ft. Other experiments are in progress, but
    it seemed advisable, without waiting for their completion, to make
    this addition to the paper, to show that the law fails both when short
    exposures and also feeble intensities of light are in question.

          tions.     Preliminary Note."         By J. J. Walker, F.R.S.
          Received May 19, 1893.
       Having been led to study more particularly than, as far as         I am
  aware, has hitherto been done the conditions of the arbitrary dis
   placement of a rigid body in space by means of rotations only, the
   results arrived at in the case of the single pairs of axes seem to me of
   sufficient interest and completeness to warrant their being recorded.
       A comparison of these results with those arrived at by Rodrigues
   in his classic memoir " Des lois geometriques qui regissent les d6-
   placements d'un systeme solide dans l'espace         ...     ." 'Liouville,'
   vol. 5, 1840, at once suggesting itself, it may be proper here to recall
  the substance of the latter, and show how far they fall short of the
  object I propose to myself.         The case of displacement by successive
  rotations round a pair of axes is discussed in § 13 (pp. 395 — 396),
  ¦where it is shown that (p. 390), " Tout deplacement d'un systeme
 solide peut etre represents d'une infinite de manieres par la succession
 de deax rotations de ce systeme autour de deux axes fixes non con-
 vergents. Le produit des sinus de ces demi-rotations multiplies par
 le sinus de Tangle de ces axes et par lenr pins courte distance, est
 eg"al, pour tons ces couples d'axes conjuyues, au produit du sinus de la
 de mi-rotation du systeme autour de l'axe central du deplacement,
znnltiplie par la demi-translation absolue du systeme."
      Then (p. 396) the converse of this theorem is affirmed, viz., that
"   Tout    deplacement     .  .  .  peut toujours provenir, d'une infinite de
manieres,      de la succession de deux rotations autour s de deux axes non-
convergents pourvn que le produit.         .  .  ."
      In   this conversion     of the theorem above, it is strangely over-
                                                                    i. 2

looked    that a displacement is not defined by the direction of axis,
and amplitude, of the resultant rotation, together with the magnitude
of the component of the corresponding translation along that direc
tion (for in this form the proof is given, the axis being drawn through
one end of the common perpendicular to the particular couple in
respect of which the theorem is demonstrated), since these elements
are common to an infinity of displacements.
    This being premised, the laws connecting pairs of axes by successive
rotations round which a given displacement of a rigid body in space
may be effected are as follows: —
    If the first axis   (f f ) is taken arbitrarily, say parallel to a given
 vector, f ', and passing through the term of a second given vector,       f , its
conjugate is parallel to a vector (f), the side common to three quadric
cones, the constants of which are functions of         f , f, and the vectors
 defining the displacement.
    Each of these cones, whatever the direction of         f , passes   through
one of three fixed vectors.
    The directions of the axes being fixed in accordance with the above
conditions, the locus of either axis is a plane, the places of the axes
in which are so related that the connector of the feet of perpen
diculars on them from any fixed point generates a ruled quadric
surface.
    [The last three paragraphs have been altered (July 15) after a
correspondence, since the reading of the note on 15th June, with
which Professor W. Burnside, F.R.S. (who, however, is not respon
 sible for any statement herein), favoured me; as the result of
which he sent me a geometrical proof that one axis might in all cases
 be taken arbitrarily both in position and direction.        On revising my
 analysis, I found that what      I  had taken as an equation of condition
was reducible to an identity.]

transformations.

twenty-seven lines to each other are deduced, and some theorems
with respect to the lines, which believed are new, are established

  In the paper of       1892I   endeavoured    to correct, enlarge, or justify
interpretations previously given.          One aspect of this revision led to a
controversial paper, challenging some points of interpretation which
occur among the facts in my contribution.      It entitled " On theis
 Shoulder Girdle in Ichthyosauria and Sauropterygia,"    J. W. Hulke,       by

 150       Prof. H. G. Seeley.       The Shoulder Girdle, and       [June  15,
 F.R.S., received by the Royal Society April         11, read   May  12, 1892.
 All that     was then before the Fellows is printed in the Proceed
 ings for August 26, 1892, p. 471, and the paper was printed in
 No. 316 of the Proceedings.         As my own paper had not been pub
 lished when that by Mr. Hulke was read, and as his paper is entirely
 devoted to controverting my conclusions and discrediting the
existence of evidence which is there figured, it is obviously based
 upon an imperfect knowledge of the facts.             I  should have been
content to have left the vindication of the truths and ideas which I
 endeavoured to state to others, but that          I had no opportunity of
 meeting the author's contentions, when the abstract of his paper was
 read  ; and because there are misconceptions of my meaning, some of
which    I  should be glad to remove.      The point of view taken by Mr.
 Hnlke as the foundation for his criticisms is said to be mainly
 embryological work upon existing Reptiles and Amphibians, the
exact relation of which to the extinct Ichthyosauria and Sauroptery-
gia cannot be stated with precision, though all writers concede that
 the groups compared, Urodela, Anura, Lacertilia, are distinct orders ;
and    I  believe that the differences between tbem are too great to be
expressed in this way.       The embryology of Ichthyosaurs and Plesio-
saurs being necessarily unknown, it seems to me that no sound inter
pretation of the obscure parts of their skeletons can be based upon such
evidence ; unless it is previously shown that there is a predominant
affinity of the extinct organic type with the recent type to which it is
compared.       I should, therefore, attach less value than does Mr. Hulke
to the embryological considerations which he adduces in relation to
the identification of bones as being omosternal on the one hand, or
clavicular on the other, and as determining the existence or absence
of a precoracoid element in these extinct animals.               Rather than
import    into  discussion such  hypothetical  foundntions  for nomenclature
of the bones of the skeleton in extinct animals, I prefer to trust to
visible evidence of the relative position of the disputed bones, and to
such comparisons with their condition in allied animals as may
appear to justify inferences as to their true nature.
    In discussing the shoulder girdle in Ichthyosauria, I have suggested
that the conditions of the bones appear to indicate a precoracoid
element, which was cartilaginous, and was not preserved.            I assume
that such an element may have extended from the scapula to the
coracoid, transversely in front of the coracoid, and anteriorly between
it and the clavicle.       To this suggestion Mr. Hulke replies that the
appearance of a division of the articular end of the scapula into
three parts is fallacious (he. cit., p. 234) and illusory (p. 235).       The
basis for this statement is said to be a careful study of many Ichtbyo-
saurian scapulae, and especially of a separate scapula lent hy Mr. A. N.

prises in this region only two parts — " one posterior, glenoid, diarthro-
dial segment ; the other, an anterior synchondrosial segment, which
articulated with the coracoid." This is a point upon which I may
state that in describing Ophthalmosaurus* I suggested the view which
Mr. Hulke has adopted. But I appeal from those disconnected bones
to the evidence from the specimens in museums like the national
collection. The Natural History Museum contains isolated scapulae,
but it . also contains some scapulae in natural position in the
skeletons from the Lias, and there are other skeletons exhibiting the
shoulder girdle in good preservation in the Geological Museum^ at
Cambridge and elsewhere.

     "When the hones occur separate the scapula can usually be fitted
  to the coracoid ; then the surface which formed part of the articulation
 for the humerus is clearly distinguishable from the surface 'which
 joined the coracoid.     And if the an tero- posterior extent, or measure
  ment from within outward, of the coracoid surface which articulated
 with the scapula is taken, it will be found to be greatly exceeded by the
 length of the opposed surface of the scapula, as it extends from the
 humeral articulation forward to the clavicle.       So that there is a free
 edge of the scapula, which is cartilaginous, extending in front of its
 coracoid articulation, and between that articulation and the clavicle.
 This surface is distinct from the coracoid surface, first in being much
 thinner; and, secondly, in commonly making an angle with that
 surface, though     I do not attach much importance to the latter cir
 cumstance, as it may be affected by conditions of preservation and
 completeness of ossification.     In one species of Ophthalmosaurus, in
 the British Museum, a part of this margin of the scapula anterior to
 the coracoid is concave and completely ossified where it formed part
 of the coracoid foramen (fig. 1, lower right-hand figure), but anterior
 to that is the unossified surface, which   I  suppose to have been for the
precoracoid cartilage. On the inner anterior margin of the coracoid
will also be found a surface, which indicates a cartilage, which           I
believe met the clavicle. The examination of the skeleton shows that
the tripartite division of the scapula at its articular end, as figured
by Cuvier, and as represented by Sir E. Home, to wbom the sternal
bones were first pointed out in detail by Buckland, as drawn by De la
 Beche for Sir E. Home, as represented in Professor Huxley's figure
and as affirmed by myself, cannot be regarded as illusory or fallacious
on the evidence given     ; and at present no reference has been made to
any skeleton from which such an inference conld be drawn, or even in
 which the different condition affirmed by Mr. Hulke could be seen,
 though there is no reason why such a condition should not be found.
    The importance of this discussion centres round the significance of
the notch or concavity on the anterior border of the coracoid, which
is placed towards the scapular margin.           Does that notch represent
the coracoid foramen of existing Reptiles? Such a foramen is seen in
the coracoid bone in Lizards and Hatteria, and has been regarded as
marking the union of the precoracoid and coracoid elements into one
bone, and on that account        I have spoken of it as the precoracoid
foramen.     It is more distinct in Amphibians, though it is differently
placed.    It occurs in Crocodiles. Among extinct animals it is found
in the Saurischia and Ornithischia.      It is present in the scapular arch
of Pareiasaurus and Anomodonts.         It may be compared to the fora
men    in Ornithorhijnchus between the scapula and precoracoid.       If the
notch in the coracoid of Ichthyosaurus, which is towards the scapula,
should be regarded as representing the coracoid foramen of any of

these groups of animals, living or extinct, then it would, from the
analogy of shoulder girdles which from age or plan are imperfectly-
ossified, be a legitimate inference, I submit, that the foramen which
was defined on the one 6ide by bone was completed on the other
side by cartilage. The notch is in such a position that it is com
parable to a coracoid foramen.             No other determination for it has
been suggested.          If this identification were admitted, it seems to
me highly probable, from comparison of the scapular arches in extinct
Sauromorpha, that the cartilage which extended inward from the
scapnla was continuous with the cartilage which extended forward
from the coracoid, and that the intermediate part defined the anterior
margin of the foramen.               I
                                  If understand Mr. Hulke, he would admit
the existence of such a cartilage as an inference supported by analogy ;

 for he states, " the recess between the truncated antero-external
 corner of the coracoid and the adjacent anteroinferior angle of the
 scapula, both which parts bear, as Professor H. G. Seeley says, the
 mark of having had cartilage attached to them, is just the situation
 where a wider band of syncuondrosial cartilage might be expected
 than was present posteriorly where the scapula and coracoid were
 nearer together.        This passage seems to me practically to admit the
 point which I have affirmed, that the scapula shows a third cartila-
¦
 ginous attachment in addition to the two surfaces giving attachment
 to the coracoid and the humerus.              Secondly, I urged that this
 cartilage probably connected the scapula with the inner truncated
 anterior border of the coracoid.         No evidence is offered against this
 conception.
     Then the only question       of importance     is by what name such a
 cartilage might be known. Mr. Hulke              regards it as a persistent
 remnant of the continuum in which the bones originated.            I prefer to
 name    it   precoracoid, because if it were a primitive cartilage which did
 not belong to either bone, it might be expected to be encroached upon
 by scapula or coracoid, or both ; but during the whole period of time
 in which the genus Ichthyosaurus is found, there is no conclusive
 evidence of any such extension of ossification upon the scapula or
 coracoid.        Neither scapula nor coracoid alter their forms at the
 expense       of  the supposed cartilaginous continuum ; and, therefore, I
 infer that the cartilage was not ossified, but persisted as a pre
 coracoid, though, as the coracoid foramen enlarged, the amount of
 cartilage left to represent it might become small. If the foramen en
 larged so as to divide the cartilage into inner and outer portions, the
 external part adjacent to the scapula and coracoid would still be pre
 coracoid, though the part adjacent to the inner anterior edge of the
  coracoid might assume the aspect of an epicoracoid.         Snch a separate
 condition of cartilages I understand Mr. Hulke to admit.
     In my discussion of the shoulder girdle {loc. cit., p. 120) it is
 remarked that I have failed to find " a specimen which leads me to
  doubt the substantial accuracy of the early interpretations of Home,
  Bucklaud, and Cnvier, in regarding the scapula as extending an
  articular surface inward and forward towards the pre-articular por
  tion of the coracoid." This passage is referred to by Mr. Hulke in
  the following words : " In support of his conception of a precoracoid —
  cartilaginous — in Ichthyosauria, Professor H. G. Seeley cites the
  opinion held by Sir E. Home, Buckland, and Cuvier respecting the
  position and relations of the scapula." The two statements are not
  identical. Mr. Hulke reproduces the first of Sir E. Home's figures
                                                                   "

  of the several bones." It is a generalised figure in which the scapulae
  and the clavicles which rest upon them are about one-third too long,
  and the   interclavicle is about twice as wide in the staff as any speci
 men which I remember (though, perhaps, not wider than in a speci
 men figured by Cuvier), but in substantial accuracy of arrangement
 of the bones the figure is admirable, and would be marvellous if made,
 as Mr. Hulke implies, from dissociated              bones. Mr. Hulke does not
 point out any inaccuracy in the figure, which he reproduces, and no
 evidence is referred to which is opposed to the positiou of the scapula
 indicated in PL 2, fig. 1, ' Phil. Trans.,' 1818.
    In the same way the criticism upon Cuvier seems to me without
 justification.    It is stated by Mr. Hulke that, since "Cuvier copies
 both the figure given by Sir E. Home and the figure given by Dean
 Conybeare, and abstains from expressing his own views on the subject
 (of the difference between them), obviously little weight attaches to
his authority in regard to it."
    In the first place, Conybeare and Home agree in representing an
anterior surface of the scapula in advance of the articulation of that
bone with the coracoid.            Secondly, Cuvier, in the plate in which
Home's figure is copied, gives several admirable engravings of the
shoulder girdle from specimens, and his fig. 1 and fig. 5 demonstrate
that the scapula did extend a cartilaginous surface in advance of the
articulation with the coracoid.            A cast of the specimen represented
in fig. 5 is preserved in the Natural History Museum. Cuvier's
figures show variations in size of the anterior notch between the
coracoid    and scapula.

Hnlke, or for his restoration of the shoulder girdle of Ichthyosaurus

 while in Mr. Hulke's figure the breadth of the articular end of the

 to me. The difference between Mr. Hulke, on the one hand, and other
 writers is not a matter of opinion or interpretation, but of fact, which
 can only be demonstrated by examination of specimens, or figures in
 detail of the structure, shown in all specimens which I have seen in
 skeletons well preserved.
     I have stated that this identification of the precoracoid accounts for
 the structure of the shoulder girdle, and explains its homology.                      As
 both clauses of this statement are challenged,             I may state, further, that

precoracoid is developed.            I  had not realised that this was a con

    I have   also advocated the identification of the precoracoid as bring
 ing the shoulder girdle of Ichthyosaurus into harmony with that of
 Nothosaurus, because in that genus there is a similarly incomplete
 coracoid foramen, and similar internal cartilaginous surfaces truncat
 ing the coracoid anteriorly and the scapula internally so as to include
 an angle between them, which such a cartilaginous precoracoid would
 occupy, so as to complete what I regard as the coracoid foramen.                        I
 only know the Nothosaurian shoulder girdle from von Meyer's
 excellent figures, and in contesting my interpretation               I  do not gather
  that Mr. Hulke lias better knowledge of the original materials.                    It is

  because    I believe with Mr. Hulke that the precoracoid in Lizards is
  ossified.    And it is because I find no evidence that the precoracoid is
  ossified in Nothosaurus (and I do not think there should be any con
  tention that it is ossified, now that Mr. Hulke accepts the existence
  of clavicles in that genus) that I cannot regard the Lacertilian
  coracoid as homologous with the Nothosanrian coracoid.             It is sug

 gested by Mr. Hulke that the             coracoid foramen      in the Notho
  sanrian   coracoid  is not to be found  in the small  open notch which faces
  towards the scapula (/, fig. 6), but in the deep depression in the anterior
 contour of the coracoid, which is posterior in position, and nearer to
 the mesial line.        This interpretation is founded upon Mr. Hulke's
 reading    of the  Lacertilian  coracoid ; but is unsupported by evidence,
 because the structures compared are morphologically different, and
 could only be brought into comparison, I submit, by first removing the
 precoracoid from the Lacertilian shoulder girdle, when the notch or
 foramen in the coracoid of the Lizard would face towards the scapula,
 as in Nothosaurus, with a similar open angle between the two bones.
 So far from the relations of what I regard as the cartilaginous pre
 coracoid of Nothosaurus to the scapula and coracoid being different from
 what they are in Ichthyosaurus, they seem to me to be as nearly iden
 tical as possible in a widely divergent order of animals.          For, in my
 conception, there is no reason why the notches which Mr. Hulke regards
 as representing the coracoid foramina should not entirely disappear
 under ossification of the anterior margins of the coracoid bones, so
 as to bring what are at present the two widely separated anterior
 processes of the coracoids into close union with each other, when the
 difference    from     Ichthyosaurus would be less apparent.          As my
meaning has not been clearly understood,          I offer a restoration of the
shoulder girdle of Nothosaurus mirabilis, showing what I conceive
to be the position of the cartilaginous precoracoid.
    This identification of the precoracoid foramen does not depend upon
the evidence from Nothosaurus only.              There are small unnamed
Nothosaurs, figured by von Meyer in his ' Saurier des Muschelkalks,'
PI. XXXIII, fig. 45, &c, showing on the inner side of the scapula a
notch with ossified margin (fig. 7,/), altogether distinct from the carti
laginous margin of the bone behind and in front of it, and therefore
there is no doubt that both scapula and coracoid in those animals
contributed to the formation of a foramen between those bones,
which was completed by cartilage, as in the Ophthalmosaurs already
referred to.       The argument concerning that cartilage is in every
respect the same as that offered in Ichthyosaurus.         There is, however,
this difference.       The animal is fundamentally different in general
organisation.       Nothosaurs were for a long time included with the

Sauropterygia ; but since 1882 it has been clear to me that they form
a   different order, which is intermediate between the Sauropterygia
and the Anomodontia.               And although it may not be possible at
present to fully establish this conclusion, it is one in support of
which evidence can be adduced.                    It is on this account that the
interpretation of the shoulder girdle in Nothosaurus has appeared
to me to have a two-fold                   significance as establishing, first, by
comparison with Plesiosaurus, the true nature of the clavicles of
 Sauropterygia,         and secondly,      by comparison with the Anomodontia,
 I think it places beyond question the true nature of the precoracoid.
The large questions of organic affinity              I  regard as safe bases for the
morphological interpretation of the skeleton.                   If I do not enter into
discussion of        Lariosaurus,    it is  because  the  scapulae are displaced, and
I have already referred to the type on a former occasion.
    The Anomodont comparison is important. First there is a notch
in the Anomodont scapula which I regard as a Mammalian character,
and this notch is completed externally by the ossified precoracoid,
and passes obliquely through that bone, so as to excavate the
coraeoid. The relations of these bones are shown in I'areiasaurus
Baini (fig. 2), and in many South African Anomodonts. As the
specimens have been figured, it may be sufficient to refer to the
figures as showing that the relations of the precoracoid                           to the
coraeoid and scapula are almost identical with those which I have
suggested for the cartilaginous precoracoid in Nothosaurus (fig. 6)
and     Ichthyosaurus (figs. 1 and 4).               Mr. Hulke has not pointed
out any difference in this part of the skeleton from the Ichthyo-
saurian or Nothosaurian type, which would invalidate my interpre
tation that the difference between them, which is most essential
in plan, is that Anomodonts have the precoracoid                          ossified.     The
ossification        occupies substantially the same position which                 I  have
attributed       to the precoracoid in the types in which it is supposed to

160       Prof. H. G. Seeley.        The Shoulder Girdle and      [June  15,
be  cartilaginous. The weight of this comparison consists first in the
direct resemblance of plan between the Anomodontia and Ichthyo
sauria in the clavicular arch and the shoulder girdle, where the
difference is essentially that in the former the precoracoid is ossified,
while in the latter there is a vacuity in the position which the pre
coracoid      occupies in the former.        And secondly, although the
resemblance in detail in this region between the Anomodontia and
the Nothosauria is less close, as shown in the construction of the
scapula, there is a closer organic affinity between these types, which
gives importance to the resemblances which have been stated.
    The anatomical comparisons which have been made amount,                I
submit, to as close an approximation to proof that the precoracoid
was represented by cartilage in Ichthyosaurus as could be given of
a structure which is necessarily not preserved           in the skeletons in
which it has been argued to have existed.          They may be thought to
justify the suggestion of a cartilaginous precoracoid in Ichthyosaurus
which was advanced in my paper.
                               The Sauropterygia.
    I have regarded the Sauropterygian shoulder girdle as comprising
the same bones as the shoulder girdle in Ichthyosauria and Notho
sauria, and urge that the difference between them is that there is no
trace of a precoracoid        in Pleeiosaurs, even the cartilage in the
shoulder girdle indicated in those orders having disappeared.            The
clavicular arch in all three orders appears to me to be formed of the
same elements, which       I regard as being typically an interclavicle and
two clavicles.       These identifications are contested by Mr. Hulke, who
advances the hypothesis that the bone which          I regard as a scapula is
a precoracoid in its inner portion and a scapula in its outer portion ;
and secondly, the hypothesis that the bones which I regard as a
clavicular arch are not homologous with clavicular bones, but are a
new kind of arch, formed from omosternal bones.                Both of these
hypotheses seem to me untenable, for the reasons presently to be
stated.     In the first place, attention may be directed to the pre
coracoid.      Mr. Hulke has not explained why it is morphologically
necessary to find a precoracoid in Sauropterygia when its existence is
not affirmed by him in Ichthyosauria. He would apparently admit
 (fig. 4, loc. cit., p. 241) that in Lacertilia the precoracoid loses its
individuality by union with the coracoid, and, as I have stated, there
are many examples which probably show such a condition among
extinct animals.       But heie is a suggestion to blend the precoracoid
with the scapula, to which no parallel can be found, as I believe, in
true Reptiles, recent or fossil. It is not suggested by Mr. Hulke th t
any specimen exists in which there is a trace of a division of tl e

anterior bone of the Plesiosaurian shoulder girdle in the way which
he represents by shading in his figure (fig. 8, p. 246) of the crushed
and imperfect Woodwardian specimen, which may be compared with
the figure given by myself in 1865 from a photograph, in the ' Annals
and Magazine Nat. Hist.,' series 3, vol. 16, PI. XV. In that specimen
there is a partial longitudinal division, which I believe may be better
explained by fracture. When the specimen was originally described,
Plesiosaurian clavicles had not been identified, and         I thought the
division might represent a clavicle external to the scapula, and,
although that view became untenable with the discovery of the
clavicles in 1874 (' Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc.,' vol. 30, p. 444),. I have
since suggested that the ossification, if it ever were distinct, may
represent the epiclavicle (ec, fig. 2) which extends along the superior
margin of the scapula in Pareiasaurus Baini. It must be remem
bered that in Plesiosaurus this supra-arthroidal process of the bone
is very thin, and ascends nearly vertically, so that it would be
peculiarly liable to fracture.      The specimen is elucidated by no
other example in the separation and displaced position of the
ascending process of the scapula ; and, since it differs from other
specimens from the Lias only in the horizontal and displaced position
of that process,    I have no doubt the specimen is delusive, in so far
as it appears to suggest two separate bones.       If the bones had been
separate   there  would  have  been  presumably    a cartilaginous division
line between the two elements, if both entered into the formation
of the humeral articulation, in the position in which a division is
figured by Mr. Hulke, whereas there is no such indication of division
in the specimen, or in any other specimen.
   This crushed bone is insufficient to support and sustain a new read
ing of the homologies of the great bones of the Sauropterygian
shoulder girdle. If there is no other objective evidence in the Plesio
saurian skeleton, and Mr. Hulke mentions no other, there is,               I
submit, no evidence in support of a precoracoid in the Sauro-
pterygia, except such as may result from comparison of Plesio
saurian bones with those of other animals, since the division drawn
(' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 52, p. 246) is not in the line of fracture.
   I  am in entire agreement with Mr. Hulke in comparing the
shoulder girdle of Sauropterygia with that of Chelonia, these orders
being grouped in the Sauromorpha, in the scheme of classification
given in 1891 (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 49, p. 520).        The difference
between the views of Mr. Hulke and myself consists in the method
of comparison and its results. In Sauropterygia the bone in advance
of the coracoid which joins it by suture is in the same plane with
the coracoid.    In the Chelonia the bone which has the same relation
to the coracoid is nearly vertical to the coracoid, or only inclined
slightly forward. The Chelonian bone consists of two slender rays,

which diverge bo as to include between them a large angle.                     The
ventral ray extends transversely inward to the median ventral line
towards its fellow, in a way to which no part of the bone in the
genus Plesiosaurus offers a parallel ; the dorsal ray ascends to the
carapace in a way which is equally unparalleled in Plesiosaurus.
There are two methods in which these structures may be compared
in the two groups.
    First, we may suppose, as Mr. Hulke does, that although the cora-
coids have no median union with each other in Chelonians, they are
strictly comparable with the Plesiosaurian coracoids, which unite by
a median suture.         Then the ray of the anterior bone, instead of ex
tending inward to meet its fellow, as in Chelonians, may be supposed
to be directed forward to become an expanded plate, uniting with
its fellow in some genera of Sauropterygia (e.g., Murcenosaurus) in
the median line, and in such cases it may send a ray back to make
a median union with the coracoid.              Further, the vertical or for-
wardly inclined bar of the Chelonian bone is supposed in Plesio-
saurs to be represented by the compressed plate which, ascending
from the horizontal ray, extends above the articular surface for the
humerus.       Hence the two rays of the bone in Plesiosaurs are in two
planes, one horizontal, and the other vertical, while in Chelonians
the two rays may be regarded as substantially in the same plane,
which, in so far as it is not vertical, is inclined forward.              In both
groups    of  animals    Mr.   Hnlke names the ventral ray precoracoid, and
the dorsal ray scapula.
    There is another way of bringing the two types of shoulder girdle into
 comparison.       If the elongation of the neck in Plesiosaurus is supposed
 to be brought about by an augmentation in number of the vertebrae
 from a type in which they were less numerous, then there is some
 ground for anticipating that the scapula, if originally in such a
 vertical position as it holds in Chelonians, would have itB free supe
 rior end carried forward, until it might come to be in the same hori
 zontal plane with the coracoid.*            This is what I infer to have
 happened,    and   to  represent   the mutual  relations of the parts, so that
 the forwardly directed horizontal plate of bone in Plesiosaurus would
 be homologous with the vertically directed bar of bone in Chelonians
 which all anatomists agree in naming scapula.                  And, therefore,
 there would be nothing in the Plesiosaurian shoulder girdle to cor
 respond to the ray of bone which is directed inward ventrally in
  Chelonians, and that element;         I suppose, to have practically disap
  peared from the Plesiosaurian skeleton.          Hence the ascending ray of
  the scapula in Plesiosaurus, which extends above the humeral articu
 lation, would not be homologous with the vertical ray of the scapula,

 in Chelonians. There is in this interpretation an element of sim
 plicity, because the scapula is Bimply inclined forward in a way to
 which there may be some slight approximation in Chelonians, which
 brings the two types of shonlder girdle into easy comparison.               The
 coracoid8 in Plesiosanrs meet each other in the median line, and this
 condition has, T suppose, led- to the atrophy and non-development of
 snch a ray as Mr. Hnlke terms the precoracoid, but which                   I
                                                                         believe
 to be a portion of the scapula,* on the hypothesis that such a ray
 may have once existed.
    The choice between these methods of interpretation may depend
 upon the name adopted for the bone which most anatomists have
 termed scapnlo-precoracoid in Chelonians, for if there is a pre
 coracoid in the Chelonian, which is blended with the scapula, so as to
 be inseparable from        it,
                             then there would be some ground for Mr.
 Hulke's contention that the precoracoid was represented in the scapula
 of Plesiosanrs, even though there would be a difference of opinion still
 as to the position in which          was to be sought for, which would
                                       it
 depend upon views as to the way in which the Plesiosaurian girdle
 was formed. Professor W. K. Parker termed the inner ray of the
 Chelonian bone precoracoid, and appears to base his interpretation
 chiefly upon the condition of the bones in the African Ostrieh. It              is
 stated  (' Ray Soc.,' " Shoulder Girdle," p. 141) by the late Professor
 W. K. Parker, of Chelone Mydas, " There                 nothing that can be

indication of composite structure. Mr. Hulke quotes H. Rathke's

                                                                       it

  Ohelonian bone, recent or fossil, which I have examined, so far as can
 be  judged from the ossified bone, and it is closely comparable to the
  conditions of ossification of Plesiosaurs on the one hand, and of
  Amphibians on the other, in which the original cartilage of the
 humerus and femur becomes sheathed by an external layer of bone,
 leaving the cartilage in the position of an epiphysis, which penetrates
 more or less conically from the articular joint of the bone into the
  sheath, becoming an ossification which sometimes blends with it, and
 is sometimes for a time separate in the young state.
     There is no evidence advanced that two distinct cartilages enter
 into the composition of the part of the glenoid fossa formed by this
 bone, and I affirm that its two rays are sheathed separately, because,
 owing to the original form of the cartilage, it would not be conceiv
 able that the sheaths Bhould be formed in any other way.       But in his
 account of the young Sphargis, Rathke expressly states that the two
 sheaths coalesce when they meet each other, and therefore form one
 sheath, without any indication of a primitive separation between the
 two rays of ossification which afterwards became obliterated. Just
 as the ossification of the humerus of a Plesiosaur in three portions
 does not make that bone any the less a humerus, so the ossification of
 the scapula in a Chelonian in two or three parts, of which the articular
 part was originally cartilaginous and two are the coalesced ectosteal
 sheaths, does not seem to me to make that bone any the less a scapnla
in Chelonians. There is therefore no proof that the bone in Che-
lonians is anything but a scapula, or that the precoracoid is present
in the Chelonian skeleton, any more than in the Plesiosaurian
skeleton.
    It only remains to point out that the ascending process of the Plesio
saurian scapula is homologous with that which is developed backward
in the Nothosaurian scapula (figs. 6 and 7), and     I have no doubt that
both are homologous with the blade of the scapula in Ichthyosanrs
and Anomodonts.       But, in proportion as this scapular blade is de
veloped, so does the scapula acquire a position which is posterior to the
coracoid ; while that position is the result of a special development of
a new structure which ascends in these animals external to the ribs,
above the humeral articulation.       Its development is accompanied in
Anomodonts by an atrophy of all that part of the scapnla which had
originally extended in advance of the articulation.       This view may
be hereafter established by further evidence.    If the older view, which
Mr. Hulke puts forward, should be preferred, there would still remain
the evidence that the precoracoid has no existence in Chelonia, and
therefore inferentially has no existence in Sauropterygia.        So that
the bone which extends in Plesiosaurs anterior to the coracoid would
still be the scapula, and tho shading which Mr. Hnlke places upon it,
dividing it into precoracoid and scapula, would be a delusive indica

 1893.]     Clavicular Arch in Ichthyosauria and Sauropterygia.          165
tion of an osteological separation of one bone into two bones which
has no existence.
   But the effect of the extraordinary difference in number of vertebras
in the several regions of the body in Plesiosanrs and Chelonians
cannot,   I  think, be ignored in judging between the hypothesis of
morphological displacement of one limb of the scapula as against
morphological development of the other limb, -when the bone is con
sidered in Plesiosaurs from the point of view of a Chelonian com
parison. The morphological resemblance with Chelonians is not so
close as to solve the problem by comparison only.
   Finally, there remains the clavicular arch, or, as Mr. Hulke terms
the bones, omosternalia.         Mr. Hulke regards the interclavicle as
derived from the mesial ends of the clavicles (p. 246), and the
omosternum as derived from the epicoracoids, so that in existing
animals these structures appear to originate differently. Unfortu
nately there are no epicoracoids preserved in the Sauropterygia, so
that it is impossible to base the nomenclature which Mr. Hulke
prefers upon a morphological or structural basis.
    The reason why the omosternal interpretation has been preferred
by Mr. Hulke is stated (p. 252) to be the undisputed deep position of
the bones, which are sometimes completely hidden by the scapulae,
and which always rest upon the visceral, as distinguished from the
ventral, surface of those bones ; and this, coupled with the composite
structure, is the only reason advanced.             I would compare this
nomenclature for the bones, which            I have figured as clavicular
(' Roy.  Soc.   Proc.,' vol. 51, pp. 129, 131, 133,  140, 147, &c), with the
nomenclature adopted by Mr. Hulke for the corresponding bones in
Nothosaurus ('Proc. Roy. Soc.,' vol. 52, p. 240).          The interclavicle
and clavicles are there represented, and the clavicles are correctly
shown to extend on the deep-seated or visceral surface of what I
regard as the scapulas, precisely as in the Sauropterygia.          So that
the supposed proof from deep-seated position, which shows the bone
not to be clavicle but omosternum in Plesiosaurus is exactly the same
as that which is considered by Mr. Hulke to prove the bones which
correspond to them in position in Nothosaurus, to be not omosternal,
but clavicular.     In both types the scapula is placed horizontally in
advance   of  the  coracoid, although there are some differences of form
in the bones as compared with the Plesiosaurian genera. But all
von Meyer's specimens show that the clavicles in Nothosaurus extend
upon the visceral surfaces of the scapulas, precisely as in Plesiosaurus.
Mr. Hulke does not question that the bone named scapula in that
genus represents the scapula. There is no suggestion that it includes
the precoracoid; and it appears to be suggested that the part of the
 coracoid which is internal to the notch in the anterior part of that
 bone is precoracoid ; so that the precoracoid would be an indivisible

 16fi     Prof. H. G. Seeley.     The Shoulder Girdle and       [June   15,
 portion of the coracoid.     Hence, apparently, the difference in inter
 pretation, the omosternnm being asnumed to join the precoracoid
 •when it is present, while the clavicle is assumed to join the scapula.
 This interpretation is entirely hypothetical ; for there is no more
 evidence in favour of the Nothosaurian coracoid being a coraco-
 precoracoid than there is in favour of the Pleeiosaurian scapula being
 a precoraco-scapnla.    And therefore there is no foundation for the
 difference of interpretation which would name the bone which rests
 upon the visceral surface of the anterior element of the shoulder
girdle in Nothosaurus a clavicle, and that which rests upon the
visceral surface of the bone which occupies the same position in
Plesiosaurus an omosternal bone.        This arch in Nothosaurus consists
of a small median piece and two long lateral pieces, which may, I
think, be compared with the elements figured in Plesiosaurus ('Roy.
Soc. Proc.,' vol. 51, p. 129), although the median element is much
larger in the Plesiosaur, and the lateral elements are much shorter.
Until some evidence is forthcoming to show that the bones which
form an arch in the same position and are similarly situate on the
visceral surface of the bones of the shoulder girdle are different, there
is no justification for applying different names to them, or assuming
that they are not homologous.        la some of the smaller Nothosaurs
figured by   von  Meyer it is  evident  that the anterior visceral surface
of the scapula was smooth, so that the clavicle joined the scapula by
squamose overlap, and not by suture, as in the genus Nothosaurus,
thus approximating more nearly to the condition in Plesiosaurus.
    The circumstance that the interclavicle in Nothosaurus and its allies
is not wedged in behind the visceral surface of the coracoids, is
necessarily a consequence of the small antero-posterior development
of the median union between the coracoid bones, and the great length
of the clavicles, by which the interclavicle is carried forward in the
middle of an arch which is convex in front ; while in Plesiosaurs
what I believe to be the homologous arch is shorter and similarly
directed backward. But there is no difference in plan.          In Plesio
saurs (loc. cit., p. 129) the clavicles are directed backward exactly as
in Nothosaurus, and it is only the anterior margin of the inter
clavicle which is concave in front. There is so much in common
in the structure of the skull, in the vertebral column, in the pelvic
arch, the shoulder girdle, and limbs between the Sauropterygia and
Nothosauria that there are probably no two other well differentiated
orders of animals which have greater organic affinity with each other,
and, therefore, although    I have proposed to recognise a cartilaginous
precoracoid in Nothosaurus of which no evidence is available in
Plesiosaurus, I can see no ground for supposing that the bones of the
shoulder girdle which are actually preserved are not severally the
game as in the Sauropterygia.

    There is another point in Mr. Hulke's argument. He adopts the
classification of tbe shoulder girdle bones into primary or cartilaginous
and secondary or membranous.              There is no doubt that in the im
mature Plesiosawnis, in which all the indubitable cartilage bones show
unossified cartilaginous surfaces and margins, the two bones figured
(' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 51, p. 133) which I regard as clavicles are com
pletely ossified, with sharp well-defined margins, and show no signs
of immaturity ; and        I  therefore regarded them as membrane bones.
Some of    the   clavicular bones figured at the same time (loc. cit., p. 131)
are almost as thin as bones could be, and in marked contrast to the
cartilage bones of the skeletons with which they are severally
associated, although there are other examples in the collection of
Mr. A. U. Leeds, of which he has since had the kindness to send me
drawings, which are considerably thicker.              If these bones had been
omosternal     bones,    segmented    from  epicoracoids which are cartilages,
presumably they would have been cartilage bones.               But the immature
specimens     to  which    I have  referred show   no  indication of having had
a cartilaginous origin.         Mr. Hulke states that it is possible that the
bones    which    he  terms   omosternal  are membrane bones, but adds that
this is not yet absolutely certain, and yet, having urged that the dis
tinction between the two groups of bones rests upon their different
origin in the embryo, concludes that the weight of evidence is still in
favour of an omosternal homology.
    I am unable to imagine any evidence more conclusive than that
Which has been brought forward, based upon the condition of the
bones themselves in the young Plesiosaur, and comparison with the
condition in Xothomiurus.
                                                      I
    From 1874 (' Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc.'), have indicated affinities
between Sauropterygia and other animals.                 The comparisons which
 have weight are indicative of a common plan between the animal
 types compared.          Affinities which can thus be demonstrated may
 justify views of homology in interpreting obscure parts of the
 skeleton, which are more valuable than the views based upon
 resemblances       of form found in isolated bones in animals which
 are widely different in organisation.           I  have formerly pointed out
 elements of the skeleton in which Plesiosaurs show characteristics of
 Amphibians, as in the mode of ossification of their long bones.
  Exactly the same condition of ossification is found in Nothosaurus.
  If this is an Amphibian inheritance which amounts to identity of plan
  in the construction of the limb bones, in a way which marks these
  two orders of animals off from other groups, it does not furnish an
  a priori ground for assuming that the coracoid, the scapula, and the
  arch of bones in front of these are all morphologically different in
  the Plesiosaurs and Nothosaurs, but rather that they are substantially
   the same.

168                  Structure, $c, of the Fossil Reptilia.      [June 15,
    If  the significance of these Amphibian characters is further found,
as    I  urge, in a sequence of affinity between the Sauropterygia,
Nothosauria, and Anomodontia, we should be justified in anticipating
that there might be a community of plan in the shoulder girdle of
those groups which would enable homologous elements to be recog
nised.     Until such comparisons fail, they cannot be disregarded.
    The view which       I ha.ve discussed in justification of that offered
to the Royal Society in 1892 may be summarised in the statement
that the Anomodont is a type in which the precoracoid is ossified ;
that in the Nothosaur the precoracoid has ceased to be ossified, but is
represented      by cartilage ; while in the Plesiosaur the precoracoid
cartilage appears to be lost. But with this change there is no
change of plan in the clavicular arch, other than results from the
different habits of thfe several orders of animals and the forms of
the girdle bones with which the arch is associated.

    The author endeavours to separate the Labyrinthodont remains,
distinguished by having teeth anchylosed to the jaw, from such as
 belong to animals having a Theriodont type of dentition.               The
 genera founded upon cranial fragments which show the Theriodont
 type are Deuterosaurus, Rhopalodon, and Dinosaurus.           The skull in
 Deuterosaurus is described from new materials, which make known
 the structure of the palate and other cranial structures.        The palate
 is of Plesiosaurian type. The back of the skull is a vertical plate, and
 the brain cavity rises in a long vertical tubular mass to the parietal
 foramen.      The quadrate bones descend below the foramen magnum
 in a way that is best compared with Plesiosaurs.
     The articular end of the lower jaw is identified among bones
 figured by von Meyer.
     The skull of Rhopalodon is nearly complete, and has a general
 resemblance to the skull of the South African Dicynodont Ptychogna-
 thus. The orbit is defended with a sclerotic circle of bones. Whereas
 in Deuterosaurus there is only one molar tooth, in Rhopalodon there
 are apparently eight molar teeth, which have the posterior edge finely
 serrated.
     The vertebrae are known from isolated and connected specimens
 which indicate a larger number than usual of rib-bearing presacral

vertebrae,    which appear to be not fewer than nineteen, and may have
numbered twenty-six. The sacral vertebrae are deeply cupped, and the
sacral ribs are developed as in Nothosaurug and Pareiasaurug. The sacral
ribs form part of the articular face of the first sacral vertebra.        The
pelvis  is  imperfectly  known  ;  the ilium is not so extended  as in Dicyn-
odonts, and conforms to the type of Phocosaurus, which is regarded
as Theriodont.        The pubis and ischium are united together on the
Dicynodont plan, but are only moderately developed.
   The scapular arch is completely known, and is formed of scapula,
coracoid, and pre-coracoid as in Dicynodon and Pareiasaurug.              The
humerus and bones of the fore limb were relatively short, and only
i'ragments have been preserved which appear to be referable to ulna
and   radius.
   The hind limb is known from several examples of the femur, which
resembles that of Pareiasaurug in the proximal end, but at the distal
end is more like the type described as Saurodegmus.
   The tibia is knpwn from its proximal and distal ends ; it has a
general resemblance to that of Pareiasaurug, but is more slender.
These types are regarded as constituting a distinct group, named
Deuterosauria, which is in many respects intermediate between the
Placodontia and Theriodontia, but in skull structure appears also to
approach Nothosaurs and Plesiosaars.

   The specimens used in the following investigation were collected
in Calcutta in 1891.
    The phenomena attending menstruation are grouped into four
periods, and these are subdivided into eight stages :
    A. Period of rest. Stage I. The resting stage.
    B. Period of growth. Stage 11. The growth of stroma. Stage III.
           The growth of vessels.

   The body of the uterus consists of an internal mucosa and external
muscle    layers.   The mucosa is composed of uterine and glandular
 epithelium, blood vessels, a few radial muscles, and stroma.            The

stroma    has the appearance of embryonic mesoderm, the internuclear
protoplasm is drawn out into very delicate processes forming a con
tinuous network     ;  there is no intercellular  substance to be seen, and
a few long radial fibrils are present during the resting stage only.       It
is a very primitive tissue.
                                    Period A.
    Stage  I. —The uterine epithelium      is a single row of cubical cells;
its onter edge is sharply defined in section but the protoplasm of
the base of the cells is continuous with the protoplasmic processes
of the stroma.
    The glandular epithelial cells are columnar ; they rest on a base
ment membrane but have no sheath.
    Round nuclei are embedded in the protoplasmic network of the
stroma, which is evenly disposed for one- third of the depth of the
mucosa, while below that a few radially arranged fibrils occur.
    The blood vessels are small and fairly numerous.
                                    Period B.
    Stage  II. — An   increase   in the number of the nuclei of the stroma
by amitotic division and probably by fragmentation, causes swelling
and increase of density in the upper third of the mucosa — hyperplasia.
 Owing to pressure the nuclei become fusiform. An enlargement of
vessels takes place.       No decidual cells are formed.
    Stage III.  — The mucosa is further swollen.         The epithelium is
 stretched and becomes thinner.          Hyperplasia  of the vessels directly
below the epithelium takes place and they are congested.
    The size of many of the nuclei of the stroma is reduced.
                                    Period C.
    Stage IV. — Hypertrophy of the uterine epithelium of the stroma
 and of the walls of the vessels appears all over the mucosa : followed
 by degeneration in the superficial region, where the dilated, congested
 capillaries breakdown, the blood contained therein being extravasated
 amongst the stroma.
    The degeneration        is probably amyloid or hyaline, not fatty de
 generation.
    A considerable      increase  in the number of the leucocytes     in the
 superficial vessels takes place.
    There is no migration of leucocytes and no diapedesis of red blood
 corpuscles, but where vessels are ruptured a few leucocytes are swept
 out together with red blood corpuscles, into the surrounding tissue;
 many leucocytes, however, remain attached to the remnants of the
 walls of the broken-down vessels.

1893.]       The Menstruation of Semnopithecus        entellus.       171
    Stage V. — The extravasated blood now collects into lacunae which
are first formed within the stroma but gradually extend superficially,
displace the intervening stroma elements and lie directly in contact
with the epithelium.
    The vessels in the deeper mucosa remain intact ; there is no trace
of diapedesis and no red blood corpuscles or leucocytes in the stroma
in this region.
    Stage VI. — The lacunae increase in size. The uterine epithelium
and superficial stroma shrivel up and exhibit signs of degeneration.
The epithelium ruptures and the blood contained in the lacunae is
poured into the uterine cavity.
    Stage VII. — Denudation .follows.       All the uterine epithelium, a
portion of the glands   and   in  some  places a whole gland, and a depth
of about one-third of the layer of the stroma is cast away, together
with ruptured vessels, red blood corpuscles and leucocytes. Of these
substances the menstrual clot is formed.
    This is a severe, devastating, periodic action which is very re
markable.
    A ragged surface is left behind and the remaining stroma contains,
at or near the surface, masses of extravasated blood.        In the deeper
parts   of the mucosa  there  is no further   change.
                                  Period D.
    Stage  VIII. — The recuperation consists of the re-formation of the
epithelium, partly from the torn edges of the glands and partly by
 means of the transformation of stroma elements into flat epithelium ;
 of the formation of new capillaries in the superficial region out of
 the stroma cells which surround the intercellular spaces in which the
 extravasated blood lies, and in the return of this reclaimed blood to
 the circulatory system ; of the return of the vessels in the deeper
 mucosa to their normal size and consistency, and of the return of the
 stroma to the condition of rest (Stage I).
     The new epithelium, at first flattened, becomes cubical, and new
 glands are formed from folds of this epithelium.
     The numerous leucocytes left with the extravasated blood are
 returned to the circulatory system with the latter ; they do not
 migrate, they do not form new tissue in situ or pus on the wounded
 surface.

     Out of the ovaries of forty-two specimens of menstruating S. entel

  seen.   Such a result appears to be sufficient to warrant the state
  ment that —

   1. Ovulation does not necessarily         occar during      each   menstrual
        period, and
   2. That menstruation is not brought about by ovulation.
   The two corpora lutea seen occurred in specimens of Stage              III and
Stage  IV  ; during  these    stages  the  first   great increase  of  the  blood
supply to the mucosa takes place, and it therefore appears possible
that the increased supply of blood to the generative organs during
the early stages of menstruation may possibly induce ovulation when
a sufficiently ripe ovum is present in the ovaries; there is direct
proof, however, that an ovum is not dehisced at each menstrual
period.
                                    Conclusion.
   Recent observations show that periods of growth and degene
ration occur in the mucosa of the bitch when rutting, but de
nudation is not described.         There is good reason to believe that
the period of growth is invariably present in the mucosa of rutting
animals, and, as ovulation and rut are stated to be coincident, it
appears highly probable that the period of growth during menstrua
tion represents the preparation of the mucosa for the reception and
retention of an ovum, while the degeneration period represents the
result of failure to fertilise the ovum or failure of ovulation.
   I venture to express the belief that the function of menstruation
may be thus expressed, but       I fail to find any evidence of the origin
of menstruation.
   Note. — Since the above was written,          I  have seen Marshall's book
on 'Vertebrate Embryology' (1893), in which he also divides the
phenomena of menstruation into four stages, identical with my four
Periods A, B, C, and 1).          The arrangement was arrived at inde
pendently.

   1893.]          Morphology   of Spore-producing  Members.            173
     The   first pages are devoted to the discussion of points of general
  morphology of the sporophyte, as it is seen in archegoniate plants,
  together with a sketch of the history of opinion as to the morpho
           " dignity " of the sporangia and their relation to the
  logical                                                              parts
  (nsually sporophylls)     which  bear them.   The  position of  Goebel   is
  adopted, that sporangia are as much organs, sui generis, as are shoots,
  roots, Jcc, no matter where     they may be seated.   It is customary to
  assume that the ontogeny will serve as a guide to the history of
  descent in plants as in animals. As applied in detail to the sporophyte
  generation this assumption cannot be upheld : for the conclusions
  drawn from wide comparison would be directly antagonistic to such a
 history.      The young sporophyte of a Fern first forms foliage leaves,
 stem, and roots ; only after a considerable     period are sporangia pro
 duced.      On the recapitulation theory it would be concluded from this
 that the vegetative system was the first to appear, while sporangia were
 of subsequent origin, and it might further be held that sporophylls
 are metamorphosed foliage leaves.        But the whole comparative study
 of the sporophyte       of lower forms  leads to the opposite conclusion ;
 spore-production was the first office of the sporophyte, and if the
 lower Bryophyta really illustrate       the mode of origin of the sporo
phyte, the production of spores preceded the existence of a vegetative
system of the sporophyte, and was apparently a constantly recurring
event throughout evolution.         It must, therefore, be concluded that
the history of the ontogeny does not truly recapitulate the historv of
descent as regards the neutral 'generation ; the sporophyte is, in fact,
an intercalated        phase which has acquired vegetative characters.
 Comparative study of the Bryophyta leads to the conclusion that the
 whole vegetative region was the result of progressive sterilisation of
potentially sporogenous tissues.
    A brief review of the progress of this sterilisation as it has already
been recognised among the Bryophyta is next given ; it is pointed
out    that (a) the sterilisation may involve the whole thickness of the
sporophyte, as in the formation of the seta, or (i) it may make itself
apparent only in individual cells of the sporogonial head (elaters).
It  is  important to note that Leitgeb concluded that in certain cases
the    latter might be massed together to form solid tracts of sterile
tissue, such as the columella of the Anthocerotea?.          But though a
considerable       degree of vegetative   advance may be traced in the
Bryophyta, and correlated with progressive sterilisation,     still they are
clearly     marked from vascular plants by two characters: (1) the
absence      of appendicular organs j (2) the single continuous archo-
sporium.
    There are,      at least, three possible ways in which plants with
numerous separate archesporia may have originated from plants of
the Bryophytic type :
                             (i) by branching (chorisis) of a sporogonial

174                  Prof. F. 0. Bower.        Studies in   the       [June   15,
head   ; (ii) by formation    of entirely new archesporia, having no direct
connexion by descent         from pre-existent ones ; (iii) by partitioning
of a continuous archesporium ; this might readily result from partial
sterilisation and formation of septa. It has been one chief object of
this investigation to see what evidence may be gathered from Vascular
Cryptogams of one or of all of these modes of origin. The question
has been first approached by examination of the
                                                           " strobiloid " forms.
   The frequent presence of synangia in eusporangiate Vascular
Cryptogams suggests either coalescence accompanying reduction in a
descending series, or partitioning by means of septa in an ascending
series ; the first question in connexion with such synangia will be
whether in any natural sequence of Vascular Cryptogams the pro
gression from a non-septate to a septate condition can be traced ; or
the converse.     Though the facts at hand do not amount to an actual
demonstration, the Lycopodinese and their allies are believed to be
an ascending series, and they are seen to supply important evidence.
The series Phylloglossum, Lycopodium, and Selaginella, Ltpidodendron,
and the Psilotacesa show natural affinities.           In a paper shortly to
appear    in  the  '
                      Annals   of Botany
                                           '
                                             I  have  drawn     attention to the
remarkable anatomical similarity which links the Psilotacete to
Lepidodendron, while no one would doubt the kinship of the latter to
other Lycopods. To this series Tsoetes may be added, for, though the
anatomical correspondence is not so close,         I think its affinities with
the Lycopods are nearer than with any other family.
   As regards the sporangia, there can be no doubt of the homology
of the sporangium of Phylloglossum, Lycopodium,                 Selaginella, and
Lepidodendron ; similarity of position, structure, development               (not
traced in Lepidodendron), and function all show this.                Within the
genus Lycopodium differences of detail have been observed analogous
to such differences as would result in the production of more bulky
sporangia, such as those of Lepidodendron and Isoetes, though it is
true these differences are not so extensive.              In these very large
sporangia trabecular are found, as rods or plates of sterile tissue,
which may project far upwards into the sporangial cavity (Lepido
dendron), or may extend the whole way through it to the upper wall
(Isoetes).    In the latter case it has been shown by Goebel that the
trabecule are the result of differentiation of a potential arche
sporium, part of which is sterilised and forms the trabecules.               But
these are at most only partial septa.
   The next step is to the Psilotacese ; and the first question is that of
the real nature of the synangium in these plants. While Goebel and
Juranyi' look upon the sporangiophore as an abbreviated axis bearing
two leaves, the synangium occupying its apex, Graf Solms, from
external observation of Tsilotum, maintains the older view, that the
whole sporangiophore is of foliar nature with two lobes, while the

1893.]          Morphology   of Spore-producing      Members.              175
synangium is a growth from its upper surface.             This latter view I
am able to support from evidence of sections both of Psilotum and
Tmesipteris.    The latter shows the synangium to originate below the
apex of the sporangiophore, and from its upper surface, in a manner
very similar to the sporangium of Isoetes.          The form of the young
synangium resembles that of the sporangium of Lepidodendron, with
which genus also there is extraordinary anatomical similarity.             The
position so close to the apex of the sporangiophore is peculiar, but it
is to be noted that there is variety among other Lycopodinea in the
position of the sporangium. The septum is similar in its origin to
the sporogenous masses, and is not at first distinguishable from
them ; in this respect it also resembles Isoetes.      It would thus appear
that the whole synangium is comparable in origin and position, in the
broad lines of development, and in function to the sporangia of other
Lycopods, that is, a septate comparable with a non-septate body.
   Misgivings which may be felt in face of such a conclusion will be
in great measure removed by the results of study of certain modifica
tions to which the synangia are liable. Tmesipteris appears to be a
variable plant as regards the form and structure of its synangia ;
there is, however; some method in its irregularities ; smaller synangia
of simpler form and structure are found at the limits of its fertile
zones, while about the middle of it synangia have been found with three
loculi, corresponding to those of Psilotum. Examination of those of
simpler form shows that they may be only partially septate, or the
septum may be absent from the first.          I have been able to prove in
young synangia    of this type  that  the tissue which would normally form
the septum may be sporogenous ; this is exactly the converse of what
has been proved by Goebel in Isoetes, and the conclusion which may
be drawn is that there is no essential difference between the tissue which
will form septum or    trabecules and that which      will form   spores, since
they can  mutually undergo conversion.
    It has already been shown by others that in Psilotum the number
of loculi in the synangium may vary, being sometimes two, normally
 three, but occasionally four or five. In Tmesipteris it may be one,
 two, or three; and as there is no doubt of the homology of these
 within the Psilctacere, we may conclude that in homologous parts the
loculi may vary in number from one upwards.
    We may recognise within the species Tmesipteris a correlation of
size to number of loculi ; the smallest specimens have no septum,
and these are produced at the limits of the fertile zone, where nutri
tion may be failing ; those which are of normal size have two loculi :
occasionally, when of large size and well nourished, as at the middle
of the fertile zone, the loculi may be three.      Here is illustrated in one
 species much the same sequence as is seen elsewhere for distinct
 genera, such as Lycopodium,         Isoetes,   Lepidodendron : where the

  sporangium is small there are neither trabecules nor septa, the
  exigencies of nutrition, and perhaps also of mechanical strengthening,
  not being felt (Lycopodium) : where the sporangium is large sterile
   bands of tissue are present ; these appear as trabecule or incomplete
  septa in Lepidodendron or Isoetes, but as complete septa in the large
  synangia of Tmesipteris.      To those who accept the homology of the
  synangium    of  Tmesipteris with    the sporangium of other Lycopodiuea3
  the probability of this will appear specially strong. Such facts as
  these and their theoretical bearing are discussed at length in the
  memoir : the opinion is finally expressed that progressive sterilisa
  tion and formation of septa are factors which will have to be taken
  into account in solving the problems of origin of vascular plants, and
  especially of their numerous sporangia: such formation of septa will
  have to be considered as one factor which may help to explain the
 origin of the simpler vascular plants from forms of some Bryopbytic
 character, in which the sporogenous tissue was one continuous band.
     In the course of the investigation it has become apparent that it
 is not possible to give any strict topographical definition of the arche-
 sporium which shall apply for all Vascular Cryptogams.         This will not
 surprise  those    who   have recognised    that  the position of the arcbe-
 sporium is not fixed for all Bryophyta, while, on the other hand, the
 first segmentations which lead to the definition of the archesporium
 in Vascular Cryptogams do not correspond to those in Phanerogams,
where there is a definite dermatogen.
     The memoir, of which this is a brief abstract of a few of the
salient points, is still incomplete : it is intended shortly to treat the
spore-bearing members of the I'ilicinese from a similar point of view,
and in preparation for this a considerable number of observations
have already been made.          In the meanwhile, it may be stated that
the   main  lines  of argument pursued above in treating the strobiloid
forms will be found to be applicable also for the Filicineae.            The
second part    will also include  a  general discussion of the whole subject.

       Lemuroid from Madagascar." By C. J. FORSYTH Major,
       M.D., For. Cor. Zool. Soc. Lond., &c. Communicated by
       Dr. H. Woodward,           F.R.S., V.P.G.S., &c.      Received June
       14, 1893.
                                   (Abstract.)
    The subject of the present paper is a somewhat imperfect Mam
malian skull, together with a right and left mandibular ramus,
apparently belonging to the same specimen, discovered by Mr. J. T.
Last (collector for the Hon. Lionel Walter de Rothschild), in a

  1893.]             On  Megaladapis madagascariensis.                   1 77
  marsh at     Ambolisatra, on the south-west coast of Madagascar, beneath
  a stratum     of a white clayey substance (shell-marl ?) from 18 in. to
  2 ft. in thickness.
    At first sight the skull appears to have no relation whatever with
 any known Mammalian group, either existing or extinct.
    Its salient features are : — The enormous lateral development of the
 anterior inter-orbital portion of the frontals, extending over the
 small thick-walled orbits ; a comparatively narrow and elongate
 post-orbital frontal region, separated by a slight contraction from the
 equally narrow parietal region ; a thick and flattened sagittal and an
 equally strongly-developed occipital crest.        The zygomatic arch is
 high, and projects moderately outwards.
    The brain-case is comparatively small in size, low and short, and
 placed at a considerably higher level than the facial portion.         This
 last is elongate, with its anterior portion more elevated than the
 posterior.      The cranio-facial angle is extremely obtuse, as in most of
 the lower Mammals, but, whilst in these the angle is open downwards,
 in the present skull it opens upwards, owing to the fact that both
 the facial and the cranial portions are somewhat bent npwards, the
 former anteriorly, the latter posteriorly.
    A striking general character is the remarkable pachyostosis of all
 the bones of the skull.
    The sntnres are in great part obliterated, which, together with the
advanced wear of the grinding teeth, is indicative of the old age of
 the specimen.
    The cranium, in its general physiognomy, approaches, on' the one
hand to the South American " Howlers
                                                "
                                                  (Mycetes), on the other to
some Marsupials, and particularly to the genus Phascolarctos.
    These resemblances the author considers to be merely isomorphisms,
and are not indicative of true parentage, which is to be sought
amongst the Lemuroidea.            Of this sub-order the present animal
 would form a much specialised and gigantic member, being approxi
mately three times the size of the largest existing Lemurids.
    In tracing out these affinities, the author relies in the first instance
upon the conformation of the molars and premolars (the canines and
incisors are not preserved), which approach closely to the grinding
teeth of some Malagasy Lemurids of the genus Lepidolcmur, and
even     still more to those of CMrogaleus.
    It   is further pointed out that, in its peculiar features, the skull
itself only carries to an extreme, characters which are present, but
in a much lesser degree and in varying gradations, in members of
the Lemuroidea, both recent (Lemuridse) and extinct (Adapidse).
    The diminutive size of the brain is viewed by the author, in this
instance, as a degeneracy.          He anticipates that crania of young
specimens        would   present  a  striking approximation to existing

    Lemnrids, and probably most of all to Ghirogaleus.               Tbese resem
    blances    would consist in a more rounded cerebral cranium, in the
    brain-cavity being relatively much more voluminous, and possibly
    even absolutely so, than in aged specimens, and the facial portion
    more shortened.            Especially it is to be expected that the post-
    orbital elongation of the frontals, an isolated feature in the
     Lemuroidea, will be absent in young specimens, as it is due solely to
    the development in the adult of aerial sinuses.
       Passing to considerations of a more general nature, it is strongly to
    be insisted upon, as one of the results of this investigation, that the
    short cerebral and elongated facial portion of the cranium, universally
    accepted as a characteristic feature of the primitive Mammalian skull,
    are, on the contrary, indicative of a very specialised condition.
       The author maintains that retrogressive evolution is more fre
    quently to be met with amongst the Mammalia than has hitherto been
    admitted, " low organisation being by no means always synonymous

          "                "
    with primitive organisation.
       In accordance with the conclusions arrived at, the author suggests
    the establishment of a new genus, Megaladapis, for the present fossil
    skull, as well as its collocation in a distinct family of the Lemuroidea.

    has been brought to light by the explorations of Mr. Last, and the
    earlier researches of Grandidier, who (26 years ago) explored the
    same marsh at Ambolisatra.                Some of the Mammalian remains
    obtained are too scanty to admit of accurate determination, but they
    are sufficient to indicate other not less strange members of this

   As to the geological age, the evidence obtained goes far to prove
      this " snb-fossil
                         " fauna existed at a
that                                                  comparatively very recent
period,  and that Man was contemporary with these Vertebrates.                 The
evidence   of various kinds may      be  arranged as follows : —
   1. The very fresh aspect of all the remains, which are
   2. Found in marshes and in recent alluvia (dunes), the formation
of which is still in progress.
   3. Crocodilus rdbustus is still existing in lakes in the interior.
   4. Some of the bones bear traces of Man's handiwork.
   5. The record of a monstrous animal, probably the Hippopotamus,
is preserved in the legends of the natives.
   6. Amongst the accounts — brief descriptions with native names —
given by a trustworthy          explorer of the seventeenth century, De
Flacourt, are several which, on account of size and other characters
assigned to them, cannot be identified with any animals actually
existing in the island.       One of the descriptions may possibly refer to
MegcUadapis     and  that  of  a bird, from the size of an Ostrich to one of
the species of ^Spyornis.
    7. Remains of domestic cattle were found, together with the bones
of the extinct forms of Mammals, &o.
   On the other hand, evidence is adduced in support of the almost
certainty that a Tertiary Vertebrate fauna will be, sooner or later,
forthcoming in Madagascar, owing to the recent discovery of Tertiary
lacustrine deposits in several different localities in that island.

       injected into a Vein."             By Vaughan Harley, M.D.,

       London, Grocer Research Scholar.                      Communicated by
       George Harley, M.D., F.R.S. Received June 13, 1893.
                    (From the Physiological   Institute, Leipzig.)
    It  being no longer doubted that sugar is essential to life, and it
 having been experimentally shown that the animal organism can
 form saccharine matter out of proteids, as well as carbohydrates,                it
 becomes    of importance to know what changes sugar undergoes in the
 body before its elements are finally eliminated.
    According to present knowledge,         it is considered      that by the three
 chemical    processes of hydration, oxidation, and reduction, the mole
 cule o£ sugar is changed into larger and smaller molecular groups,
 and that it is in the breaking down and building up of these that
 heat and    vital energy are developed.          The basis of this belief rests
 on the   observation that when sugar is artificially introduced into the
                                                                         n 2

180           Dr. V. Harley.       Some   of the Effects and   [June 15,
system its disappearance   is accompanied by the liberation of heat
and the development  of muscular  energy.
   To discover the modus operandi of this is a matter of extreme diffi
culty, from the fact that when sugar is artificially introduced into
the living circulation it is rapidly distributed to every organ of the
body. In each of these it undergoes specific changes.       So that, while
the number of its derivatives arc great, the amount of each is pro
portionally small.    So small is   it, indeed, of some of them, as to
render their collection in sufficient quantity for the purposes of
investigation next to impossible. However, by the advice and kind
assistance of Professor C. Ludwig,        I made the attempt, and the
present   communication,  whichI    have   the  honour to lay before the
Royal Society, embodies in brief the results of the research.
   The methods adopted were briefly as follows:— As sugar artificially
introduced into the veins is rapidly, and in different animals in vary
ing proportions, eliminated by the kidneys, the ureters were ligatured
so as to retain the sugar in the organism.      In all cases where was
                                                                  it
intended to kill the dogs within a few hours, the ligaturing was done
from the front. Whereas, when        it  was intended to keep the dog
alive, the operation was performed from behind, and the ureters tied
by means of ligature-staff, so that, at any given time, the ligatures
             a
could be removed without re-opening the wound. In order that all
the animals should be under exactly the same conditions, in so far as
their assimilative functions were concerned, no food was given to
them during the previous twenty- four hours.
   A 50 per cent, chemically pure grape sugar, dissolved in normal
saline, was slowly introduced into the jugular vein.         10 grams of
sugar to every kilo, of the dog's weight were the most usual quanti
ties employed, and the whole introduced in about an hour.
   After the necessary treatment of the various organs, the quantity
of sugar was estimated by Allihn's method, the quantity of lactic
acid by Drechsel's method, and the quantity of glycogen by Kulz's
method.     Alcohol, acetone, acetoacetic acid, /3-oxybutyric acid, and
ammonia were tested for in the usual way.
   The following  is a summary of the facts obtained — :
  1.  Nervous Phenomena. — It was noticed that large quantities of
sugar gave rise, in dogs, to   a series of symptoms pointing to nerve
centre poisoning, their severity varying in different cases.
   These nerve symptoms were generally preceded by, or attended
with efforts at vomiting. But, from their stomachs being empty,
the animals only brought up frothy mucus.
   In some cases, the irritation of the nerve centres was only shown
by muscular movements, causing      a  trembling of the skin. In other
instances   the muscular contractions were sufficiently severe to
cause  a  quivering of the limbs, or even well-marked convulsions

1893.]       Chemical Changes of Sugar injected into a Vein.            181
Daring the convulsive stage the pupils were contracted, although
still reacting to light.     The respirations were greatly increased.
Around the mouth frothy mucus collects. The convulsions alternated
with periods of rest, which gradually prolonged themselves until the
dog seemed to be asleep. The convulsions sometimes were followed
by profound coma, out of which the animal could not be roused.           In
some of the dogs the coma set in without any preliminary convulsive
stage. Both the convulsive and comatose state always passed off
when the ureters were loosed, while in some instances all the symp
toms disappeared of their own accord.
    10 grams of sugar per kilo, usually proved fatal to small dogs
during the convulsion stage, from the respirations suddenly ceasing.
Large dogs (of 20, or more, kilos, weight), showed only very mild
symptoms, even after as much as 12 grams of sugar per kilo, weight
were employed.
    From the order of appearance and disappearance of the symptoms
 above alluded to, it seemed as if the sugar, by the breaking up of
its molecule, yielded a poison or poisons, which, on being further
transformed, became harmless.
    It is worthy of note that none of these symptoms occur when sugar
 is absorbed from the intestines, no doubt for the same reason as
 they do not occur when only small quantities of sugar are injected
 into a vein; namely, because the intermediate products are never
 present at any one time in sufficient quantity to produce them.
    2. The quantity of sugar that remained as sugar in the different tissues
 of the body was estimated at various periods of time after the com
 pletion of its injection.

  From this it was seen that the quantity of sugar goes on diminish
ing after its injection, and that by the sixth hour it had reached
(Exp. X) even a lower point than what it stood at after the twenty-
four hours' fast.
  (6.) The quantity of sugar found in the liver, as compared                  with that
met with in the blood.

   The great difference observable between the quantity of sugar in
the liver and in the blood shows how imperfect must be the passage
from the liver into the general circulation of such a diffusible sub
stance as sugar.  This is all the more remarkable when we remember
that the liver cells are surrounded not only by blood, but also by
lymph, vessels.
  (c.) The Presence of Sugar in the matter vomited.
                                                    — As previously
mentioned, several of the dogs vomited a quantity of mucus after the
injection of the sugar.
   In the cases in which the vomit was analysed it was found to
contain sugar in small quantities.
   (cZ.) Quantity of Sugar in the Alimentary Tract.
                                                    — In order to ascer
tain if any of the sugar was eliminated into the alimentary tract, the
contents of the stomach and intestines of three dogs were analysed.
As all were in a fasting condition, contamination from food had not
to be feared.
   In onlyone case was sugar found in the stomach, and then only to
the amount of 0'174 gramme. In no case was it found in the intestines.
So it had, in all probability, been eliminated by the salivary glands
and swallowed with the saliva.            I
                                     am led to this opinion on account
of Weyert having pointed out that when large quantities of sugar
are injected into a vein, it    is,
                                in small quantities, eliminated with the
saliva.
   One may therefore,     think, consider that the alimentary tract does
                           I
not eliminate sugar.

 the form of sugar by the kidneys.                The small quantity found in the

  glycogen had been formed from the sugar that had been artificially
  introduced into the general circulation.

   4.   As it was thought possible that lactic acid might be one of the
substances     into which sugar split up in the organism, quantita
tive estimations were made of it in the blood and certain of the
tissues.

   It  is here seen that a marked increase of the lactic acid takes place
after the injection of sugar.          Further, that after the fourth hour it
decreases slower        than does the percentage of sugar itself in the
blood.     In  the following table the effects of this slower decrease is
well shown.

   These results give an average of 0-065 per cent, of sugar as against
0'096 per cent, of lactic acid in the blood.                  Whereas, in dogs on
normal diet, Gaglio has shown the quantity of sugar in the blood was
more than the quantity of lactic acid.
   (6.) Quantity of lactic acid in the liver and muscles as compared

   The liver is thus seen to contain more lactic acid than the mnscles,
while, on the       other hand, the blood sometimes contains more and
sometimes less than both the liver and muscles.
   From this it might be inferred that if the amount of a substance in
any given part of the body yields a clue to the seat of its formation,
it is probable that the liver is the principal seat of the lactic acid
formation, as pointed out by Wyssokowitzsch.
   (c.) Quantity of lactic acid excreted in the urine, the ureters having

   From these results it appears that lactic acid is not only increased
in the    blood after the injection of sugar, but that it is at the same
time excreted in the urine, -whereas lactic acid is not known to
occur in healthy dog's urine.

                                               @-nxybutyric acid are often found
in the urine of diabetics, it was decided to examine it for these sub
stances.
   (a.) Acetone and acetoacetic         acid were found to    be present     in all the
five urines examined.
   (6.) p-Oxybutyric acid was searched for            in the urine both with the

polariacope and as a-crotonic acid, but could not, with any certainty,
be demonstrated.
   6.  The  blood   was examined for alcohol, acetone, and acetoacetic acid
by  distilling it  at a temperature     of 102° C. by means of steam passed
through it. The distillate being examined for alcohol and acetone.
While in normal blood so treated neither alcohol nor acetone could
be demonstrated, in the blood of dogs subjected to the sugar injection
the presence of both of these substances was readily recognised.
   Acetoacetic acid was searched for by acidifying the blood with
sulphuric acid and then again distilling it.              By this means its
presence was also demonstrated in the blood of the sugared dogs.
   7. As not only alcohol and acetone but likewise acetoacetic acid was
found in the blood after the intravenous injection of sugar, it was
decided to see how much ammonia could also be distilled off after
adding magnesia to the blood. In the first place, as it was necessary
to see if ligaturing the ureters caused an increase of the ammonia
normally present in the blood. The blood of a dog in which the
ureters alone had been ligatured was distilled, first immediately after
and then a second time when the ureters had been ligatured five
hours.    The first blood yielded 0-025 per cent, and the second 0*024
per   cent, of ammonia.       So the ligaturing of the ureters had caused
no increase in the quantity of ammonia present in the blood.
   The same thing was then done with the blood from dogs before and
after the intravenous injection of sugar.

                3-8                    0-039
   It  is thus seen the sugar injection had caused no increase in the
quantity of ammonia in the blood.
   It may be safely concluded that ammonia is not the cause of the
nervous symptoms which followed the injection of           I per cent, of sugar
intravenously.
   As these results again do not accord with those which follow on the
injection of alcohol, we are led to suppose that they may be in some
way or another connected with the presence in the blood of the ab
normal substances, acetone and acetoacetic acid, which, as was seen,
were not only found in the blood but likewise in the urine.

     The possibility that the increase in the quantity of the lactic acid
 may likewise assist, if not be a material cause, in producing the
 nerve-symptoms, is also worthy of note.
     That sugar, acting as sugar, was not their cause was shown by the
 symptoms not appearing until from a quarter to one hour after its in
 jection.    That is to say, not till the quantity of sugar present in the
 blood bad already markedly decreased.
 XVIII. " Experiments        on Variola and Vaccinia."      By S.Monck-
       ton Copeman, M.A., M.D. (Cantab.). Communicated by
       Professor M. Foster, Sec. U.S. Received June 14, 1893.
    In  the course of some experiments on the bacteriology of vaccine
lymph,     I was confronted by a difficulty in the practical testing of
certain of the results of my work. Continuous experimentation on
children being obviously out of the question, I was naturally led to
turn my attention to the discovery if possible, of some one or more
of the lower animals which, by reason of their passing through the
various stages of vaccination and more especially variolation in a
manner comparable with that witnessed in the human subject, might
serve me for control experiments.
    Little or no success having been obtained with the various
domestic animals,     I  next turned to the monkey tribe on account of
their similarity in many respects to man, although assured at the
time that they were not susceptible to either vaccinia or variola.
On putting the matter to the test, however,        I  found that this was
not the case, the inoculation of vaccine and of variolous lymph
having each of them given, in my hands, successful results in every
instance in which    I  have tried it on the monkey (Rh&sus).
    In the case alike of variola and of vaccinia, the local result of
inoculation attains its acme (qua vesiculation) in the monkey, as in
the human being, about the eighth day. The first signs of reaction
appear usually on the third day, by which time, if variolous lymph
has been used, there is a distinct, though very thin, crust over the
site of inoculation. By the fifth day vesiculation has generally com
menced, this becoming more obvious up to the eighth day, though
even then it is much less marked in variolous cases than in those
'which have been vaccinated, the difference being easily recognisable.
    Later the vesicle gives rise to a pustule, by which time there is not
infrequently considerable swelling of the skin and subcutaneous
tissue and of the nearest lymphatic glands.        The pustule gradually
dries up, and a scab is formed which is more pronounced after
 vaccination than variolation, and which falls off some time during
the third week, if the monkey has not picked it off before.

188                Experiments on Variola and Vaccinia.                [June    15,
    The chief difference noted between the effects resulting from the
local inoculation of these two diseases, in the monkey, is that in the
case of variola there is more or less of a crust from the first ; that
vesicnlation is much less marked in variolation than in vaccination ;
that with variola about the ninth to the eleventh day a general
eruption may appear which in some instances covers the whole sur
face of the body ; and that the final scab at the site of inoculation is
not so elevated in the variolated as in the vaccinated animal.
    In both cases there is a rise of body temperature, which is more
marked and longer sustained in variola than in vaccinia.                      After
variolation it was noticed in several instances that the monkey
suffered from diarrhoea, that its eyes were suffused, and that it was
not as active as ususal. A peculiar odour was also noticed, quite
distinct from the well-known smell of " monkey."
    In no instance had the disease a fatal termination.
    It was next determined to make trial as to the protection against
small-pox afforded in the monkey by previous vaccination, and the
protection against vaccination afforded by variolation.                     I
                                                                      And went
on to compare the effect produced by the use of human and of calf
lymph respectively.
    As the result of numerous experiments, it would appear that the
mutually protective power of lymph obtained from these three different
sources when inoculated on the monkey is practically identical in all
respects.
    Experiments have also been carried out on the bacteriology of
vaccine lymph, with the view especially of discovering what means of
storage are best adapted for securing sustained purity of the lymph
and the unimpaired manifestation for indefinite periods of the
action peculiar and essential to its use.
    I  have previously shown* that there are three species of micro
 organisms, one or other, or all, of which is almost universally to be
 found in every specimen of vaccine lymph examined.                     These are
 (1) Staphylococcus      albus,  (2) S. pyogenes   aureus,  (3)  S. cereus Jlavus ;
 of which the first is frequently to be found in the upper layers of
 healthy skin. Numerous other bacteria occur from time to time,
 among which the Staphylococcus pyogenes deserves special mention.
    These " extraneous " organisms flourish in the various nutrient
 media employed for cultivating purposes, and also in vaccine lymph
 itself when removed from the body, causing, by their exuberant
 growth, the opacity which sometimes occurs in old lymph stored in
 capillary tubes. It appeared, therefore, not unlikely that in this
 way the growth of the specific organism, if such exists, might be

means of       treating     vaccine    lymph which shonld inhibit all " ex
traneous "       organisms without injuring its potency for vaccination.
To this end I first made trial of the method of fractional heating as
suggested by Kitasato for the isolation of the tetanus bacillus.                     Al
though apparently           successful    in  many      instances,    the   desirability
speedily became apparent of some method of readier application and
requiring less delicate manipulation.
   This    I at length found in the admixture -with the lymph of a
definite proportion of glycerine prior to storage in the usual way.
   Not only is lymph thus treated efficient as vaccine in the old sense
of the word, but as time goes on, instead of losing its effect on
inoculation, its potency actually becomes increased.                       Experiment
shows also that in tubes filled with such diluted lymph, opacity does not
apparently result.          As   I have previously stated, the glycerine in
hibits  the  growth of,       and   after a longer or shorter interval kills off
altogether, those aerobic bacteria which             I  have termed " extraneous."
This effect may be demonstrated by making, from tubes of glycer-
inated lymph of equal age, a series of plate cultivations at gradually
increasing intervals of time, together with control cultivations from
tubes of untreated lymph.             These results have recently been entirely
corroborated by          Sclavo,   Chambon and Menard, Straus, and other
observers, such corroboration being the more valuable since it would
appear that none of these observers were acquainted with the similar
results at which        I had previously arrived, and which were published*
more    than a year ago.
                          I
   There can thus, venture to think, be no doubt as to the superi
ority of the suggested method of lymph storage over the perhaps
simpler method which up to the present time has been commonly
employed in England.             In Germany and elsewhere glycerine has been
made rise of for various reasons, but hitherto without knowledge, as
far as   I am aware, of the peculiar action exerted by it in the purifi
cation of the lymph.

200        Mr. G. Higgs.     On the Geometrical Construction
" On the Geometrical Construction of the Oxygen Absorption
       Lines Great A, Great B, and a. of the Solar Spectrum."
       By George Higgs. Communicated by R. T. Glazebrook,
       F.R.S. Received February 20,— Read March 9, 1893.
    In the early part of August, 1890, the photographic work of the
normal solar spectrum which      I  had undertaken had been carried as
far as great A, or the limit of visibility in the red, and to X 8350, or
beyond z, in the invisible regions.
    During the two previous months of continuously dull weather,
while classifying aud comparing results,    I was interested, on making
a close examination of the head portion of the A line, to find the
symmetrical construction, the rhythmical grouping, the harmonic
order of sequence, and other characteristics of the B line repeated
here in every detail.
   These two bands, together with alpha, are composed of a number
of doublets or pairs, which approach each other on the more refrangi
ble side with uninterrupted regularity, finally crossing, and at the
limiting edges of all three bands the three last pairs overlap each
other.
   The differences   of wave-length between the components of pairs
increase in the same order.
   These and other properties, which will be referred to, are still more
obvious in the trains or flutings.
   From its holding an intermediate rank in each of its distinguishing
characters I was induced to adopt B as a typical group in a geometri
cal representation, and to investigate the subject by means of rect
angular co-ordinates.
   Before a complete analysis could be made out, a micrometer had to
be completed.      This consisted of a platform, serving as a plate
holder, which was made to travel on runners between parallel ways
by means of a screw of snch a pitch as to move the negative from
one division of the scale to the next, for one revolution of the
divided plate on the screw head, this latter being divided into
100 parts.
   On and over the platform, a microscope is mounted with slide
motions at right angles to each other ; an index of glass fibre and
reflector complete the apparatus.
   Over 1000 measurements of nearly 200 lines have been made, 100
of which belong to great A.
   In the analysis the axis of a; is assumed to occupy a position coin
cident with, or parallel to, the scale of 1/1010 m. units, and the
positions of the various lines are set off on this scale (see fig. 1) for

          of Oxygen Absorption Lines in      tlie Solar Spectrum.    201

the group, which is divided into four series. Ordinates are then
drawn in the position occupied by each line. The axis of y is divided
into a number of equal parts, 1, 2, 3, n. Lines parallel to the axis of
x, drawn from each of these divisions, intersect the respective
ordinates.   The continuous curve passing through the points of inter
section is found to possess all the properties of a parabola.
   Three points at least are selected to determine the position of the
vertex and value of latus rectum. The distance from the origin along
y is also found for an ordinate to the first line of a series.

    Now, from the equation to the parabola                             j/J   = pz, the formula
\   = V+                       is   derived, where       V=   the wave-length in       1/1010 m.

   In practice a representation more suitable for lantern projection
being desirable, two unite are taken on for each line of the series
                                                              y                                 ;
                                                           (2n+cV
the equation               then becomes    \        = VH      j-   ,   where    L   = 4p, and   c
has twice its former value.
   The computed places in the tables are derived from the equation in
the latter form the maximum want of agreement between these and
                           ;
the observed positions not exceeding (for « and B) O015 tenth-
metre.
    In   the case of           A
                   the agreement    not quite so close, the maximum
                                                      is
difference being about 0"05 tenth-metre.
   It might be supposed that the greater difference arose from uncer
tainties of observation,  caused by the greater haziness and breadth of
the lines composing         A group but
                                     the      so happens that each com

             is                                a
centre, which  facilitates the centralisation in some degree.
  The differences referred to are attributable to the fact that the
curve for any series in A, B, or a     not rigorously parabolic, bnt one
                                                     is
which cuts the parabola in three points, similar to the curve of sines,
cutting a straight line and terminating in the same phase as at the
origin.    This difference is so extremely minute in       (and in a. still    B
less)   that  it would   require  a representation  more   than 10 feet
square, or a good sized lantern screen, to show two separate tracings
at a point of maximum divergence, assuming the tracings to have bni
a breadth of     100th of an inch.
                       1/
   Following the stronger doublets in the fluting or train of A on the
less refrangible side,     a secondary train of thinner, sharply defined,
                                     is
doublets, which, with solar altitude of about 10°, may be traced on
                                      a
the photographic prints to about the 12th position. This series, which
was not previously known to exist, conforms to the same formula, and
in the table of wave-lengths     denominated the " Secondary Train of
                                               is
A." This secondary train follows in the wake of the right component
of the primary series. In the head, however, similar secondary
groups follow in the wake of both right and left components, over
lapping and interlacing each other in such           manner that their a
resolution into series can only be arrived at by deductive processes;
the difficulty is increased by the fact that a large number of positions
are occupied by the dense lines of the main band.
   These two series will be referred to as
                                             "            " in
                                               Sub-groups      the head

          of Oxygen Absorption Lines in     the Solar Spectrum.        203
of  A.    They are, with two or three exceptions, given in a frag
mentary state.     At the same time, there is nothing to prevent their
hypothetical positions being carried fnrther, except that the greater
density of the principal series precludes the possibility of obtaining
any check in regard to their conformity.
   Generally, a couple of numbers of the head bands are common to
two separate series ; this arises from their complexity being sug
gested by the nature of the analysis, and, as a matter of fact, some
of these have been observed as doubles by Professor Rowland, of
Baltimore.
   In all cases of this kind a greater density is observable on the prints,
and   is doubtless the cause of the extra density of 7608-83, which
belongs to two sub-groups ; the line 76 10"10 is known to be a double,
but cannot with safety be measured as such.
   Owing to their incompleteness, the elements of the curves for the
sub-groups in head of A have not been made out, but a glance at their
second differences is sufficient to establish their agreement with the
preceding form, since an interval is equal to d' + (n — l)d", where d'
and d" are first and second differences, and n any interval from the
commencement of the series.
   Note. — Since writing the above    I find +hat Mr. Johnstone Stoney
has written a note which was published with a paper by Dr. Hnggins
on the spectrum of hydrogen, in which he refers to the conditions
under which members of a harmonic series might fall near to, but
not on, a curve.

    During the last few years the minds of medical men and of the
 general public have been exercised over the rapid and striking increase
 in the mortality from cancer, as shown by the statistics contained in the
 Registrar- General's Annual Reports. The following table, taken from
 these reports, shows how great this increase in registered mortality
 has been.      The registered death-rate of males from this disease was
 2'7 times, for females 2"0 times, and for both sexes together 2-2 times,
 as high in 1891 as in the average for the decade 1851-60.

    That cancer has really increased in this country appears to be now
generally assumed in medical circles.
    Sir Spencer Wells, in his Morton Lecture (November, 1888), gives
the    Registrar-General's figures, showing that the mortality from
cancer had increased from 488 per million of the population in 1877
to 615 per million in 1887 in England and Wales, and from 350 per
million in 1877 to 430 per million in 1887 in Ireland, as proof of this
increase; and further quotes the statement of Dr. Fordyce Barker,
that the mortality from cancer in the city of New York had risen from
400 per million in 1875 to 530 per million in 1885.
    The attitude taken by the Registrar- General's Department has be
come somewhat modified of late years, doubts having been formerly

210              Mr. G. King; o and Dr. A.
                                             Newsholme,
cast on the reality of the increase, whereas now the generally received
medical opinion appears to have been adopted.            Thus, Dr. Ogle
 (p. xiv, Supplement to the 45th Annual Report (1882) of the Regis
trar-General) points out that the deaths ascribed to malignant disease
in the decennium 1851-60 amounted to 317 annually per million
persons living ; in the next decennium it had risen to 387 ; and in
the decennium 1871-80 to 473 ; but adds : " there can be very little
doubt that a considerable part in this apparent increase is simply due
to improved diagnosis and more careful statement of cause on the
part of the medical men."
    In the 46th Annual Report (1883) of the Registrar- General
(p. xviii), are the following remarks, bearing on the same point:
" How much, if
                    any, of this increase (in cancer) was real cannot be
stated with any accuracy ; but that some part of the apparent increase
was only apparent, and due to improved diagnosis and more careful
statement of cause, can, as we stated in previous reports, scarcely be
doubted. Tear by year the number of deaths ascribed to
                                                             " abdominal
          " and
disease          other imperfectly stated causes has been undergoing
diminution, and there has been, of course, a corresponding addition
to the mortality under the more definite headings.         Moreover, the
increase of mortality from cancer has been considerably greater in the
male than in the female sex. Now, were the rise not only apparent
but real, there would seem to be no reason why males should have
suffered more than females ; whereas the difference is readily in
telligible on the hypothesis that the rise was, at any rate in great
measure, really due to improved diagnosis. For the cancerous affec
tions of males are in a much larger proportion internal or inaccessible
than are those of females, and consequently are more difficult of
recognition, so that any improvement in medical diagnosis would add
more to the male than to the female figures."
    In the 52nd Annual Report (1889) of the Registrar-General
 (p. xiii), attention is again drawn to the increasing mortality from
cancer, which now amounted to 656 per million persons living,
" showing a further increase upon the ever-growing rates previously
recorded." Then follow these remarks (the italics are ours) : —
    " Some of the increase is most certainly attributable to increased
accuracy in statement of cause, and to the system introduced some
years back into this office of writing for further information in cases
where some vague cause, such as ' tumour,' had been given as the
cause of death in the original certificate ; a system which added, for
instance, in the year. 1889 no less than 421 deaths to the heading
'
  Cancer.' Nevertheless, in face of the constant and great growth of
mortality under this heading, and the expressed belief of medical
practitioners specially engaged in dealing with this class of diseases
that they are becoming more and more common, it seems scarcely

                      On  the alleged Increase  of Cancer.                 211
possible to maintain the optimistic view that the whole of the apparent
increase can be thus explained ; and it must be admitted, as at any rate
highly probable, that a real increase is taking place in the frequency of
these    malignant affections."
     It is evident, therefore, that although the view that the increase in
cancer was chiefly, if not entirely, apparent has, until recently, been
held in the English General Register Office, it is now reluctantly
accepted as a probable fact that cancer has really increased ; and it
must be admitted that the figures on which this conclusion is based,
as shown in the preceding table, look, at first sight, to be overwhelm
ing in the weight of their evidence.
     A more careful investigation, however, shows that the ratios pre
pared in the usual manner from the returns of the Registrar- General
at the best only approximately represent the truth, and that, in fact,
 they may even be very misleading.        Cancer is, par excellence, a disease
 of mature life. In a population of 1,000,000 adult males, aged from
 25 to 35, about 95 would die annually from cancer ; while there would
 be about 2,530 deaths among 1,000,000 males from 55 to 65, and
 4,405 deaths in 1,000,000 males aged from 65 to 75.             Therefore, to
 take the deaths from cancer at all ages in a community, and to com
 pare them with the total population in order to arrive at the cancer
 death-rate, may introduce an error sufficiently serious to vitiate the
 results. If there be a larger proportion of lives, below, say, 50 years
  of age, the fraction formed by dividing the number of deaths from
  cancer by the total population will give an unduly small ratio ;
  whereas, if the lives above 50 years of age be in excess, the ratio will
  be unduly large.      Now the age distribution of one district may differ
  materially from that of another, and the age distribution of the males
  in a community may differ from that of the females, and the age dis
  tribution of the same district may possibly differ at different periods.
  That this consideration is of great importance is shown by Table            I
  (Appendix), which gives the age distribution per million of population
  of each sex according to the census of 1881 in the several divisions of
  the United Kingdom.
      It will be noticed that the average age of females in England and
   Scotland is higher than that of males, whilo the converse is the case
   in Ireland ; and that the average age of the population in Ireland is
   much higher than in either England or Scotland.          Consequently the
   death-rate from cancer given by the Registrar-Generals of the three
   divisions of the United Kingdom in their Annual Reports are unduly
   unfavourable to the female sex in Great Britain and to the male sex
   in Ireland ; and similarly the death-rate from cancer in Ireland is
   exaggerated as compared with that of the sister kingdom.
       To rectify this error it is necessary to assume a standard of age
    distribution, to be applied to each set of statistics examined. It is not

212              Mr. G.  King and Dr. A. Newsholme.
of importance  what standard is selected, because, all the observations
being treated alike, the comparisons instituted between them will be
entirely trustworthy.    It is desirable, however, to adopt a standard
which is not purely arbitrary, and in the following investigations we
                                             "
have therefore used that given by the          English Life Table, No. 3,
Persons," as the most suitable. This represents a stationary popula
tion unaffected by changes in the birth-rate or by migrations ; and,
although no existing community conforms to it, yet, for purposes of
comparison of one community with another, it answers every purpose.
The ¦following is the age distribution according to this standard. : —

   These considerations showing that a source of fallacy lurks in the
rates of mortality usually quoted (especially when one country is
compared    with another), and that this fallacy specially affects the
question of cancer, we came to the conclusion that it was desirable to
investigate the alleged increase of cancer altogether afresh, and to
avail ourselves in doing so of all the materials that could be turned
to good account.
   In order to be useful, the materials         must extend over a long
period  of time, and  must  be presented  in  such   form that, at any rate
for several intervals of years, the deaths from cancer and the popula
tion may be grouped according to age and sex.
   The records of life assurance offices of old standing might throw
much light upon the subject, and doubtless if access could be had to-
them, and if the experience were collated in a suitable manner, an
immense amount of most valuable information would be obtained.
Unfortunately these sources, with one conspicuous exception, are not
available.   This exception is the Scottish Widows' Fund Life Assur
ance Society.    For many years that institution has been accustomed
at each septennial investigation to prepare a very complete statement
of its mortality experience, distinguishing the deaths according to
age and according to the causes of death, and at the same time giving
 the number of lives at risk in each interval of age.         Through the

courtesy     of the manager,        Mr. A. H. Turnbull, these statistics have
been   placed     at  our    disposal, and he has also kindly given ns the
figures for the four years 1888-91, which have elapsed since the last
septennial valuation, thus enabling us to bring the investigation
approximately up to date.
   So far as we know, the British Empire Mutual is the only other
office which has abstracted its experience in such a form as in the
present connexion could be of any service.               The experience of that
Society, distinguishing diseases, was published for the two periods
1847-72 and 1872-78, and the following figures are extracted from

    Unfortunately these facts are so scanty as not to afford trustworthy
averages, and we have not seen our way to make further use of them.
They show an apparent increase of about 50 per cent, in the death-
 rate from cancer in the period 1873-78 over 1847-72 ; but it must
 be remembered that, the office having been founded only in 1847,
 the lives assured had, in the earlier of the two periods, on the
 average much more recently passed the medical examination than in
the later period.          Cancer being a disease of comparatively slow
 development, this is a disturbing factor the effects of which it is
 impossible to measure.           A life office must have been established for
many years,      and must for a long period have been transacting a
business approximately uniform, before it is safe to base any conclu
 sions upon its experience of such a disease as cancer.
    The    Scottish Amicable         Life Assurance Society and the Clergy
 Mutual    Life Office have each published their experience, giving the
 deaths   from cancer and the lives at risk according to age ; and in the
 collective experience of thirty American offices, published in 1881,

214                 Mr. G.   King and Dr. A. Newsholme.
similar particulars are given; but in each of these cases only one
period of time is investigated, and therefore, for present purposes,
their figures cannot be utilised. On two occasions the Australian
Mutual Provident Society, -which is the largest life office in the
British dominions, has investigated its mortality experience, and on
each occasion has tabulated its cancer figures ; but, for various reasons
which we need not particularise, this information could not be
successfully utilised.
    The returns of the Scottish Widows' Fund, above mentioned, extend
over four septennia and a broken period of four years, making a
 total period of thirty-two years dnring which it is possible to
 minutely investigate the causes and progressive rates of mortality.
 The figures, so far as they bear upon the present inquiry, are given
 in Table   II  in the Appendix.
    The Scottish Widows' Fund statistics being only available in the
form given in Table II, we proceeded to extract the Registrar-
 General's data for the same periods and in the same form, in order
that trustworthy comparisons might be instituted ; and we also treated
in precisely the same way the valuable statistics of Frankfort-on-the-
 Main, to be described more minutely later on.
    For England, Scotland, and Ireland respectively, the census enume
 rations of 1861, 1871, and 1881 were available for both males and
 females, the populations being classified in the same age periods as in
 the data supplied by the Scottish Widows' Fund.                  We had also the
 total populations, both male and female, enumerated in 1891, but
 information as to the age distribution of these populations had not
 hitherto been published. It was therefore necessary to assume that
 the age distribution in 1891 was the same as in 1881. A source of
 inaccuracy has been thus introduced, but its magnitude cannot be
 serious.* From the figures in the four census enumerations, the
 number of males and females respectively living in the middle of the
 years 1861, 1871, 1881, and 1891, were calculated for each age period
 25—35, 35—45, 45—55, 55—65, 65—75, and 75 and over ; and from
 these figures again the numbers living in each age group in the
 middle of each year from 1860 to 1891 inclusive were worked out.
 These were then classed into septennial periods, as with the Scottish
 Widows' Fund, with a broken period at the end. In this way was
 obtained with great accuracy the population in age groups in each
 division of the United Kingdom, passing through a year of life in
 each of the septennia          under review.        The deaths from cancer,
 arranged according to age, are given in the annual returns of the
 Registrar-General, and these were extracted and summed for the
   *  Owing to the steady fall in the birth-rate between 1881 and 1891, the average
 age of the population is probably somewhat higher at the latter date. This would
 tend to slightly exaggerate the apparent increase in the death-rate from cancer.

                     On the alleged Increase of Cancer.               215
 septennial periods.    The annual returns for England and Wales and
for  Ireland came down to 1890 inclusive, but for Scotland the last
 year  available was 1889, and tbe several observations were there
fore  closed at these points respectively. In the case of Ireland, we
 could not obtain the deaths from cancer prior to 1864, and we have
 therefore been limited to the three years 1864-66 for Ireland, instead
of the seven years 1860-66.
   For purpose of reference, and in case other inquirers desire further
to investigate our figures, we give them in Tables        II to V in the
Appendix, arranged as above described.
   Prom the figures in Tables      II to V may be at once obtained the
death-rates from cancer for each period of years, and for each age
interval.    As the resulting rates are necessary to the subsequent
calculations, they are given in Tables VI to IX in detail, and are
expressed as rates per million, in order to reduce the number of
decimal places.      The numbers, as might have been expected, run
irregularly,  but, on  account of the method of grouping of the figures
later on, this irregularity is not of any practical importance.
   The rates of mortality given in Tables VI to IX, notwithstanding
the considerable numbers on which they are based, do not run with
sufficient regularity to disclose the general law by which they are
governed ; and, even though they did run regularly, it would not be
easy to discover from them that law.       Moreover, it is not the object
of the present inquiry to ascertain the liability to cancer at different
ages, but to discover whether cancer is on the increase or not in the
community generally.        It is therefore necessary so to group the
figures that the total cancer experienced at all ages in any particular
period of years may be compared with the total cancer experienced in
any other period. If we take the rates of mortality given in Tables
VI to IX and multiply them into the populations of Table B, we
shall have the desired results. The sum of the products for any
particular period of years will give the number of deaths from cancer
per annum among 1,000,000 persons aged 25 and upwards. Then by
comparing the sum for, say, the period 1860-66 with that for the
period 1881-87, we can ascertain in which direction the apparent
death-rate from cancer is progressing.     It will be observed also that
by pursuing this course the observations for all the different localities
and all the different periods of years are reduced to one common
standard, and the errors are eliminated which would arise from
variations in the age distribution of the populations. Tables X and
XI display these results in their final form, the ratios for ages under
55 and over 55 respectively, as well as for all ages, being given in
them. Some persons may be glad to be able to investigate the
matter for these two great periods of life, althongh we do nou propose
to include this branch of the subject in our inquiry.

  In Tables X and    XI  the death-rates have been corrected for age
distribution, and a single illustration will indicate how important is
this correction, and how serious an error may result from its omis
sion.   Taking from Tables         III
                                  and V the total population at risk for
all ages, and the total deaths from cancer, and dividing the second
by the first for each period of years for England and Ireland respec
tively, we shall have the death-rates from cancer in the form usually
presented by the Registrar-General.     They are given in the following
table, and alongside them are placed the corrected rates from
Table X.

  It  will be observed that by the uncorrected figures Ireland stands
a little above England for the first two periods, and a little below it
for the other three, but that no very great difference appears between
the rates for the two countries.       The corrected figures, however,
show that Ireland    stands  below England throughout, so that in the
first two periods the position of the countries is reversed by the
correction, and in the last three periods the difference in favour
Ireland is very great indeed. It is evident that the ordinary metfa
of presenting the statistics exaggerates the rate of cancer in Ireland
as compared with England, a result which, as already explained,
might have been expected, owing to the age distribution of the
populations of the two countries.
   Much light may be thrown on the subject by a careful analysis of
Tables X and XI.      It     is,
                             however, difficult from arrays of figures tlttf
ascertain their exact teaching, and        is, therefore, desirable to aMw
                                                 it
the mind by translating   the figures into  a graphic form. In Tables              7"
and XI the rates of mortality from cancer are given for five peril
of years, and from them the rates may be obtained for each
vidual year.     If these subdivided results be then plotted out
curves,  the forms and directions of the curves will show at a glance,
far more conclusively than could the most elaborate examination of

                     On the alleged Increase of   Cancer.              217
tabulated   figures,   the nature of the progression      of the rates   of
mortality.
   This distribution into individual years might be accomplished by
skilful application of analytical processes ; but the method would be
very difficult on account of the nature of the material available, and
the results    could scarcely fail to be unsatisfactory and untrust
worthy.    The end can be much more satisfactorily attained by a
modification of the late Joshua Milne's graphical method of con
structing mortality tables, which has been fully described, and of
which the beautiful accuracy has been demonstrated and illustrated

of Actuaries,' vol. xxiv and vol. xxx.   As showing the application of
the method to the present inquiry, the accompanying diagram, No. 1,
relating to England and Wales, is submitted, of which a very few
words of explanation will suffice. Along the abscissa axis are marked
off equal lengths to represent each of the periods of seven years
under review, with a portion of proportionate length for the three
years 1888-90 ; and along the ordinate axis the rates of mortality per
million are marked off.      Rectangles are then erected, the areas of
which are to represent the number of deaths from cancer in each of
the septennial periods.      Thus the area of the rectangle for the
septennium 1860-G6 is 4,375 for males, as its base is 7 and its alti
tude 625. Similarly for the other rectangles.
    Through the tops of the rectangles must then be drawn a
continuous curve in such a way that the area cut off is exactly
equal to the area added.         The length of the ordinate of the
curve which is central       to  any particular year will then give
the deaths from cancer in that year; and the accuracy of the
drawing of the curve will be proved, if there be no sudden
change of direction, and if the sum of the numbers for the seven
years of a septennium is equal to the area of the rectangle for that
septennium.       Diagram No. 1 shows the curves for England and
Wales, that for males being in an unbroken line, and that for
females in a dotted line.      Similar curves were prepared for all the
observations    so far discussed, and they are collected in Diagram
No. 3, so that they may be easily compared.       The curves for males
are in continuous lines, while those for females are broken, and that
for the Scottish Widows' Fund is marked by crosses.
   The only curve which proved at all intractable was that for
the Scottish Widows' Fund in its earlier portion.       It will be seen
from Table X that the death-rate from cancer in the first septennium
was very light, while in the second it was comparatively heavy, very
nearly equal to that in the third, and that the rates in the third.
fourth, and fifth exhibit an almost uniform upward progression.
These peculiarities are better seen by the help of Diagram No. 2,
where the deaths are represented by the rectangles.    The second and
third rectangles being of nearly the same altitude, while the first is
much lower, and the fourth considerably higher, there is indication
Of a rapid rise in the curve between the first and second periods and
of a slight fall between the second and the third, and effect has been
given to this in the undulating curve shown in the diagram. The
most unpractised eye will, however, at once perceive that the un
dulating line cannot represent the real law of the curve, and more
especially so when the other six curves are examined (Diagram 3).
Except for the one bend in the Scottish Widows' Fund curve, they
all partake of one character, and the conclusion is forced upon us

periods to form trustworthy averages, it is better to enlarge the rule,
and to redistribute the deaths slightly as between the adjacent
periods, while still arranging that the curve shall in general outline
follow the summits of the rectangles, and that the area of the curve
shall exactly equal the areas of the rectangles in the aggregate.     In
Diagram No. 2 the correction of the curve on these principles is
shown, and it is this corrected curve which is repeated in Diagram
No. 3.    How slight the correction really is becomes apparent when
we state that it is equivalent to the

and of one death from the      third to. the second septenninm.   Where
the   data   are  so  scanty such     slight adjustments are unavoid
able.    It may  be added, however, that the general deductions to be
drawn from the forms of the carves are the same whether we
adopt the original or the corrected curve of the Scottish Widows'
Fund.
   In Table XII the distributed rates of mortality, as derived from
the curves, are given for each of the seven sets of observations so far
considered.
   We are now in a position to examine more attentively the nature
of the seven curves, and to attempt to derive from them the lessons
which they are capable of conveying.
   The Irish curves are the lowest of all, and are consistent with each
other.    In each of them there is a moderate upward gradient from
the beginning to the end of the observations.
   The English curves for males and females are far apart, the female
mortality from cancer being very heavy.          The two curves are, how
ever, consistent with each other.         They  both show a decided and
slightly increasing gradient from beginning to finish.
   The Scottish curves are much nearer each other than the English,
the males in Scotland having a higher apparent mortality from
cancer than in England, and the females having one lower. The
gradient in the Scottish curves is much the same as in the English,
except tbat for the last year or two the rise is more rapid.           The
experience for the last period is for two years only in Scotland, wnile
for England and Ireland it extends over three years, and this may
account for the difference.       Probably for this reason the curves at
the end are more to be depended on for England and Ireland than
for Scotland.
   The correction for age distribution which we have introduced
brings ont the fact that Ireland seems to enjoy a great comparative
immunity from cancer.          Probably deficient accuracy in diagnosis
and certification may account for much, if not all, of this difference.
Ireland is a poor country, the majority of whose inhabitants cannot
afford to pay much for medical attendance.         The resulting deficient
medical attendance would tend to produce defective diagnosis, and
thus to lower the cancer curve.      Probably also, owing to the poverty
of the patients and consequently of the medical attendants, the
average skill of the general practitioners over large tracts in Ireland
is less than in Scotland and England, and this again would lead to
defective diagnosis.
   It is probable that in Scotland the general practitioner has been in
the past better educated than in England, and this would cause the
curves for the sexes to approximate, because in the female, cancer
being more commonly accessible in position, is more easily diagnosed

  222             Mr. G. King and Dr. A. Neweholme.
  than in the male, and improvement in diagnosis would raise the
  curve for males in greater proportion than that for females.
     This argument is, however, scarcely consistent with the fact that
  the curve for English females is the highest of the seven.    It appears
  therefore probable that, apart from  diagnosis, there  is some  cause in
  English female life more favourable to cancer than among Scottish
  women.
     The Scottish Widows' Fund curve has the easiest gradient of all,
  and this seems strongly to point in the direction so frequently indi
 cated by the Registrar- General, that the apparent increase of cancer
 in the community is due to increased accuracy in diagnosis and certi
 fication.   The policy holders in the Scottish Widows' Office are
 insured on the average for substantial sums, and are, therefore, pre
 sumably well-to-do, and able to secure, on the whole, better medical
 attendance than the mass of the people.      The diagnosis throughout
 has, therefore, probably been good, as suggested by the fact that the
 curve begins comparatively high.     But even among the most highly
 skilled members of the medical profession diagnosis has been im
 proving, and therefore the Scottish Widows' Fund curve rises like
 the others.    Among the class of practitioners attending assured lives
 there is not, however, the same scope for improvement in diagnosis
And certification of death as in the profession as a whole, and the
 gradient of the Scottish Widows' Fund curve is consequently easy.
 This curve might have been expected to be below those for English
 and Scottish males, because, although there is a small admixture of
 females who suffer more severely from cancer than males, yet the
 lives are select.      Persons with marked cancerous family his
 tories are excluded.     Cancer, moreover,    is a disease whose de
 velopment is usually gradual and slow, and may be preceded
 for several years by non-malignant disease of the part subse
 quently affected with cancer; hence, for two, or even three or
 four, years after an initial medical examination, cancer among
 insured lives should be comparatively rare.      Notwithstanding these
 considerations,   the Scottish Widows' Fund curve is above all the
 other curves for males at the commencement, though it falls below
 those for England and Scotland at the finish.         This, as we have
 already remarked, points to good diagnosis on the part of the
 medical attendants of the assured lives, and to an improvement in
diagnosis on the part of the medical profession generally during the
 last thirty years.
    Another reason for thinking that the apparent increase in cancer is
at any rate mostly due to improved diagnosis is derived from a com
parison of the curves for males and females .respectively. It will be
noticed that the curves for females are always the higher, and that
in each pair of curves the difference is practically constant through

                     On the alleged Increase   of Cancer.               223
 out the entire period. Now, if there were a real increase of cancer,
 there is no safficient ground for thinking that this would be confined
to any one set of organs of the body, or would affect one sex more than
another ; and in such case the difference between the cancer in males
 and females would be a percentage of the total, and would increase
 at the same rate as the curves themselves rise, and consequently the
curves for males and females would tend to widen their distance
 apart.    This, however, is not so. In each of the three pairs the
 curves for males and females do not diverge, but, if anything, tend to
approximate.
   It may be urged that, notwithstanding what has been said above,
cancer may have increased more in certain parts of the body than in
others, and that, although it has really increased in both sexes, it has
increased in such greater proportion among males, that the curves for
the two sexes remain parallel.      This view, however, is contradicted
by the Frankfort statistics, to be discussed presently, which confirm
in a remarkable manner the conclusion we have drawn that it is only
the cancer of organs common to both males and females which has
apparently increased, while cancer of the special female organs,
which is most easy of all to diagnose, has practically remained
constant.
   The chief weakness of the figures already given for cancer consists
in (1) the absence of distinction between carcinoma and sarcoma, the
two chief varieties of malignant disease, which are, however, patho
logically distinct; and (2) the absence of statement of the part of the
body   primarily affected by the cancer.
   An accurate statement of the site of the primary cancer in each
case   would enable us to ascertain whether the increase of cancer had
been general, or chiefly in the cancer of inaccessible            parts the
diagnosis   of  which is comparatively  difficult.   Unfortunately  medical
certificates of death commonly omit any statement of the organ
affected by cancer, and comparisons founded on those cases in which
the position is stated in successive years are open to the fallacy that
the non-localised cancers may have been transferred in increasing
numbers to the more definite headings as time goes on.
   There are no statistics available in which an accurate distinction is
made     between carcinoma      and sarcoma,       and the general terms
"cancer" or "malignant disease" must therefore be regarded as
including these two forms of malignant new growths in unknown
proportions.     It may be added, moreover, that no such statistics
would be trustworthy unless each death were followed by an autopsy
and by a microscopical examination of the diseased parts.
   The town of Frankfortron-the-Main       is the only one known to us
which has for a long series of years kept an accurate record of deaths
from all causes, in which deaths from cancer are classified according

224                   Mr.  Gr.  King and Dr. A. Newsholme.
to the parts of the body primarily affected.*                   In the original the
Frankfort figures are given in great detail, but we have summarised
them       somewhat.       Thus,   Table     XIII     shows both for males and
females at all ages the total number of deaths from cancer of various
parts of the body in the same year periods as we have adopted through
out this paper.
   The subdivisions in Table           XIII   are still too minute, and the num
bers consequently too          small,  for the purposes of useful investigation
in the present connexion, and we therefore proceeded to group them,
as shown in Table XIV, in three broad classes, which may be called
"accessible cancer," comprising cancers of external parts of the body
and other parts in which the nature of the disease is easily demon
strable during life by physical examination ; " inaccessible cancer,"
comprising cancers of internal parts and other parts in which, as in
the case of cancer of the bones, diagnosis is less easily made ; and
" cancer, position undefined," comprising simply the first line of
Table XIII. In Table XIV only deaths at age 20 and over are
included.
                                       "
    Under " Accessible cancer            we have included only the four head
ings Tongue, Mamma, Uterus, and Vagina, cancers of which are all
capable'of careful and exact diagnosis.
    Under " Inaccessible cancer" come cancers primarily affecting any
other parts of the body.
    It will be seen from Table          XIII  that the great majority of cancers
coming under this second head are of parts of the body in which the
 difficulties of diagnosis are great.
    The classification cannot be regarded as perfect.                Thus it may be
pointed out that the first group embraces a large excess of women,
 among whom it is shown by the Registrar-General's                        returns in
 Great Britain that the apparent increase in cancer has been in less
 ratio than among men. In the next place, it may be argued that we
 have placed under the " inaccessible

 that might be more appropriately described as accessible.                        The

   Of the cancers enumerated above, cancer of the pharynx, thyroid
gland, larynx, trachea, and penis are most accessible, bat their number
is so small (twelve in all) that their transference to the " accessible "
group would have no appreciable effect ; and since, before the paper
took its present shape, they had been included with other cancers in
their appropriate physiological system, and a considerable amount of
calculation had been based upon that classification, they have been
allowed to remain in the " inaccessible
                                                  "
                                                     group.
   Cancer of the prostate and bladder may be regarded as intermediate
                  " accessible " and " inaccessible "
 between the                                                groups, but as cancer
 of these organs appears to have increased in a smaller proportion than
the population, the effect of introducing it into the "inaccessible " group
is rather to diminish the already striking difference which we shall
show to exist between the increase in
                                               " accessible " and " inaccessible "
cancer respectively.
   Cancer of the oesophagus has, we think, been properly placed in
the " inaccessible group. The majority of cases of stricture of the
                       "
oesophagus in persons over 50 are undoubtedly due to cancer, and
yet certificates stating the cause of death at these ages as
                                                                         " stricture
of oesophagus," without any definition of the cause of stricture, are
still common. There can be no doubt that in the past they have been
much more common, and that therefore cancer of the oesophagus is
                                                       " cancers which have been
rightly placed in the class of " inaccessible
largely affected by improved diagnosis and certification of deaths.
   Cancer of bone has also been placed in the same group. The
 number under this head is small, and, as the vertebrae and other
 inaccessible bones are a favourite scat of cancer of bone, the classifi
cation appears to us correct.
   Cancer of the rectum is more accessible than that of other parts of

the intestines, and we have, therefore, extracted it separately, in
order to ascertain whether its increase is in the same ratio as that of
cancer of the tipper parts of the intestine.                   The result is as
follows  : —

   Thns, while cancer of the rectum increased (in absolute amount
and not relatively to the population*) 52'4 per cent., cancer of the
rest of the intestines increased 213'3 per cent. It is evident, there
fore, that, by including cancer of the rectum in the group of
"inaccessible" cancers we have further diminished the sharp
contrast between " accessible " and " inaccessible
                                                             "
                                                               cancers.
   In Table   XIII    we give the deaths from cancer in Frankfort during
the period under review, grouped according to age and sex ; and in
the sub-headings, a, /3 and 7, in Table XIV, the same facts are
classified as above described.
   Census enumerations of the city of Frankfort have been taken at
frequent but irregular intervals, and we have been able to avail
ourselves of the returns for 1864, 1867, 1871, 1875, 1880, and 1885.
From these we calculated the population in the middle of each year
from 1860 to 1889 inclusive for both males and females, arranged
according to age; and a summary of the results is given in
Table XIV. On account of the military element which prevails on
the Continent, there were some causes of disturbance, but, owing to
the frequency of the censuses, these were not of much practical im
portance, and, moreover, they scarcely affected the ages which, in an
inquiry into cancer, are principally concerned.
   From the populations of Table XV and the deaths of Table XII
the annual death-rates were calculated, corresponding to those in
Tables VI — X, but it is scarcely necessary to reproduce them here.
From these agaiu were calculated the annual deaths from cancer in
1,000,000 living aged 25 and over, the population being as before
  * The population of Frankfort increased from an average of 53,550 in the yeans
1860-66 to an average of 92,500 in the years 1881-87 ; i.e., it nearly doubled.
Therefore the rate of mortality from cancer of the rectum really diminished.

                   On the alleged Increase     of Cancer.                  227
distributed   in age groups, according to the English Life Table No. 3,
Persons, as   shown in Table B.       A very slight adjustment      -was   re
quired in consequence of the Frankfort statistics being prepared for
the decades 20—30, 30 — 40, &c, and not for 25—35, 35 — 45, Ac., as
at home.     The final results are given in Table XVI.
   The first thing that strikes one in examining' this table is, the
 marked prevalence      of cancer in Frankfort as compared with the
United Kingdom, and we have failed to discover any facts in ex
planation of this, unless it be the extremely careful certification for
which that city is noted.
   Nevertheless the same general laws prevail as with all the other
statistics available.    Cancer preponderates greatly in the female sex,
and, looking at the column relating to the total cancer, the progressive
apparent increase for both sexes is observable.               The Frankfort
figures are, however, very instructive on account of the sub-division
of which they are capable.
   The cancer of undefined position does not show much sign of pro
gressive change.      No doubt on account of paucity of data, the
nnmbers run irregularly, but from beginning to end of the thirty
years under review there is no marked tendency to increase                  or
decrease.     This fact is of great importance, because, although in any
one year there may be accidental fluctuations,, yet, taken over such a
long series of years, the figures become trustworthy.          On the other
hand, the rates of mortality from
                                          " inaccessible " cancer, both for
males and females, steadily rise, though, perhaps,              not quite so
rapidly   as   in the  United    Kingdom.       One   very   remarkable   fact
becomes apparent, namely,         that males and females suffer almost
           from " inaccessible
                                  " cancer, the
eqnally                                             average for the thirty
years being 1,641 for males and 1,640 for females.             The excessive
mortality from cancer of females is confined to
                                                       " accessible " cancer,
that  is, practically to cancer of the female sexual organs.
   The numbers relating to " accessible
                                              " cancer run somewhat irre
gularly, probably because of the pancity of data, among males there
having been only 31 deaths in this category during the thirty years          ;
bnt no well marked law of variation can be detected.              There is, if
anything, a tendency to decrease, at any rate as regards males, but
the sequence of the numbers          isnot snch that we could say with
certainty whether or not that tendency would continue were the
duration of the observations to be extended.
    Taking a general view of the Frankfort figures, the one result of
 surpassing importance to be derived from them        is   that in those parts
of   the body in which cancer   is   easily accessible and detected there has
 been no increase in the mortality        it  between 1860 and 1889.
                                    from
 It     may be mentioned that in 1887 Dr. Grimshaw, the Registrar-
 General for Ireland, began to tabulate the deaths from cancer in

 228              Mr. G. King and Dr. A. Neweholme.
Ireland, according to the primary seat of the disease, whenever this
is given in the death certificate.      The number of years as yet avail
able does not allow of any valid deductions being drawn, and the
great variation during the four available years under the head of
cancer of nnspecified parts causes a further difficulty in utilising the
figures.
   In the 52nd Annual Report (1889) of the Registrar-General for
England, the subject of the part of the body affected by cancer is also
discussed, and in the words of the Registrar- General, "a sufficiently
large sample of those cases of cancer in which the seat of disease is
more or less clearly specified
                                  " is taken out to warrant the
                                                                  assumption
that "such samples fairly represent the bulk
                                                    "
                                                      (p. 15). This method,
however, does not appear to us to furnish trustworthy results, and we
only refer to it here in passing.
   To summarise, the conclusions arrived at from the whole inves
tigation are as follows : —
    1. Males and females suffer equally from cancer in those parts of
the body common to man and woman, the greater prevalence of
cancer among females being due entirely to cancer of the sexual
organs, viz., the mamma, ovaries, uterus, and vagina.          This is shown
by   the  Frankfort statistics,  and   may not  unreasonably  be  accepted as
a probable general law, seeing that in other respects, where com
parison is possible, the Frankfort statistics are confirmed by those
of the United Kingdom.
   2. The apparent increase in cancer is confined to what we have called
" inaccessible " cancer. This is shown
                                            (a) by the Frankfort statistics ;
(6)   by the fact that the   difference   between   the rates for males and
females respectively is approximately constant, and does not progres
sively increase with the apparent increase in cancer in each of the
sexes ; (c) because the apparent increase in cancer among the well-
to-do assured lives, who are presumably attended by medical men
of more than average skill, is not so great as among the general
population.
   3. The increase in cancer is only apparent and not real, and is due
to improvement in diagnosis and more careful certification of the causes
of death. This is shown by the fact that the whole of the increase has
taken place in inaccessible cancer difficult of diagnosis, while accessible
cancer easily diagnosed has remained practically stationary.

244          Mr. J.  S. R. Russell.    On  the Nerve Roots   of
not alluded to, as they were mere conjectures, unsupported by any
substantial evidence.    The works of Krause, Schwalbe, Herringham,
and Paterson were quoted as evidence of how far the problems con
nected with this subject have been elucidated by anatomical investi
gation, and the observations of Erb, Knie, and Thorburn alluded
 to as showing what advance had been made in the subject by the
study of diseased processes in man.
   Our knowledge of this subject has been greatly increased by
numerous experimental researches, the latest of which is that by
 Sherrington.    As his work is of such recent date and contains a
historical account of all previous experimental researches that have
been carried out in connexion with the lumbo-sacral plexus, it would
be superfluous for me to do more than give a list of references to the
 various communications on the subject, including that of Sherrington,
 which list will be found at the end of this paper.
                        Anatomical    Introduction.
                  The Lumbo-sacral   Plexus in  the MonJcey.
   Forgue, who does not mention what class of monkey he is dealing
with, represents in diagrammatic form the nerves with the roots from
which they are derived as follows : — The anterior crural from the
4th, 5th, and 6th lumbar nerve roots ; the obturator from the same
roots ; and the sciatic from the 5th, 6th, and 7th lumbar and the 1st
sacral nerve roots.     The 2nd sacral root is also figured as sending
a branch to the 1st sacral root before the latter enters the sciatic.
   Sherrington describes two chief types of plexus in the monkey
                                         " postfixed " and a "
 {Macacus rhesus) ; what he calls a                              prefixed."
The former is figured as having the following arrangement.             The
external cutaneous takes its origin from the 3rd and 4th lumbar ; the
3rd lumbar also sending a branch to the 4th before the latter enters
the anterior crural and obturator nerves, which it does in conjuga
tion with the 5th lumbar root, both nerves also obtaining a filament
from the 6th lumbar, while the sciatic is represented as springing
from the 6th and 7th lumbar and 1st and 2nd sacral roots.
                                           "
   The representation of the " prefixed       plexus shows the origin of
the external cutaneous nerve to be the same as in the
                                                              " postfixed "
type, while the branch from the 3rd to the 4th lumbar root is repre
sented as joining the latter after it has given its branch to the external
cutaneous nerve.     This branch from the 3rd to the 4th lumbar ap
parently is supposed to send fibres to both the anterior crural and
obturator nerves ; these nerves also receiving branches from the 4th
and 5th lumbar roots.     The sciatic is figured as formed from the 5th,
6th, and 7th lumbar and 1st sacral nerve roots.
   That Forgue's representation of the arrangement of the plexus does

               the Lumbo-Sacral Plexus of Macacus rhesus.             245
  not agree wholly with, either of the types figured by Sherrington is
  evident ; bnt farther comparison of the descriptions of the two ob
  servers is rendered useless by the fact that Forgue omits to mention
  the class  of monkey he made his observations on.
     Like Sherrington,  I confined myself to Macacus rhesus in my experi
 ments on the Inmbo-sacral plexus, and from numerous careful dis
 sections,   I am compelled to conclude that, at any rate in those animals
 dissected by me, one type occurred sufficiently frequently to make it
 necessary to look upon it as the chief one. But at the same time,
 among the different variations, one was conspicuously more frequent
 than any of the others, but scarcely sufficiently frequent, I think, to
 warrant my at present describing two main types, in the way that
 Sherrington has done.
    The arrangement in what has been the most common type in the
 animals which came under my observation was as follows (see
 fig. 1) : — The external cutaneous received fibres from the 3rd and 4th
 lumbar roots ; the anterior crural from the 4th and 5th, as did the
 obturator nerve ; and the 6th received a branch from the 5th lumbar
root, before its junction with the 7th lumbar root to form the sciatic,
which nerve also received a branch from the 1st sacral root. As far
as    I have seen, the 2nd sacral nerve root never sends a branch to the
sciatic, in this type of plexus.
    The variation which     I  have spoken of above as being the most
common has the following arrangement (see figs. 2 and 3) : — The
external cutaneous is derived from the 3rd and 4th lumbar roots, as
in the chief type ; but the 3rd lumbar sends a branch to the 4th before
the latter gives off its branches to the external cutaneous, the anterior
crural, and the obturator nerves.      The anterior crural then receives a
branch from the 4th and another from the 5th lumbar roots, as in the
chief type ; but the obturator receives, in addition, a branch from the
6th lumbar root.      The sciatic receives no branch from the 5th lumbar
root, but only from the 6th and 7th lumbar and 1st sacral roots.         I
have been unable by the most minute dissections, aided by magnify
ing lenses, to trace any nerve fibres from the 2nd sacral root to the
sciatic trunk. It will be thus seen that the chief points of difference
between this and the most common type of plexus consist firstly in the
absence of a branch from the 5th to the 6th lumbar root, and there
fore to the sciatic ; secondly, in the fact that the obturator nerve
receives a branch from the 6th lumbar root in addition to those which
it receives from the 4th and 5th lumbar ; and, thirdly, in that the 3rd
lumbar sends a branch to the 4th before the latter gives off any
branches to the nerve trunks derived in part from it.
    In the plexus of which fig. 2 is an example there can be no doubt
that the 2nd sacral nerve root does not send a branch to the sciatic
trunk, while that from which fig. 3 is taken shows how in some cases

 it might easily be erroneously supposed to do   so, and how, in sucu an
 arrangement,    excitation currents might diffnse, with the greatest
 readiness, from the 2nd to the 1st sacral nerve root, and thus lead to
 fallacy.

     The similarity between the plexus which         I have found most common
              " prefixed "
 and the                    plexus  of  Sherrington is obvious ; but there is
 one point of difference.       The branch figured by Sherrington as going
 from the 3rd to the 4th lumbar, and thus taking part in the formation
 of the anterior crural and obturator nerves,          I have not found present.
 So, too, the variation which       I  have described as most common agrees
 with what he calls the " postfixed " type of plexus, with the exception
 that   I  have not found a branch from the 6th lumbar to the anterior
crural ; nor have       I  found that the 2nd sacral sends a branch to the
sciatic. But the number of times          I have met with this form of varia
 tion have not been sufficiently frequent to justify my denying the
existence of such a branch as that from the 2nd sacral root to the
sciatic.      Indeed, its existence in some cases is rendered very probable
by a comparison of this form of plexus with that most commonly met
by me in the dog, which resembles it, and in which the 2nd sacral
root sends a branch to the sciatic trunk. It is curious that in the
species    I  have examined, the type of plexus most commonly met with
in the dog should form the exception in the monkey, while that most
commonly met with in the monkey should be the exception in the
dog.      The fundamental point of difference in the constitution of the
                                   I
two plexuses in the species have examined has been the presence of
a branch from the 5th to the 6th lumbar root in the one form of
plexus, and its absence in the other, and it shows that the passage
from the one type of plexus to the other is not an abrupt, but a
gradual one, for, while in the majority of monkeys examined I found
the branch from the 5th to the 6th lumbar root to be large, all
graduations were met with down to the most minute filament con
necting the two roots (see fig. 4).
Tlie Muscles of the Posterior Extremity of the Monkey, and their Actions..
    In  confirmation of Sherrington          I  find that the muscles of the
     terior extremity       of the  monkey (Macacus rhesus) resemble very
           those met with in man ; but a few points of difference exist,,
      must be briefly alluded to.
    The gluteus maxim us is a very thin flat muscle. There is no
evidence of the existence of a peroneus tertius ; but peroneo-tibialis
muscle is sometimes present.            The slip which the abductor hallucis
   i man     occasionally sends to the first phalanx of the second digit is
       large and constant, forming a separate muscle in fact.
        was explained in the paper on the brachial plexus of the dog,
      ain consequences of the action of the muscles deserve careful
attention.       In studying the mechanism by which the movements are
brought       about   at the various joints,     I fonnd that a muscle might
bring about a movement at a given joint upon which it has no direct
,-                                                                    s 2

 notion, and  I showed that this is due to the fact that certain muscles
 pass  over more  than one joint, and that they are not sufficiently long
 to allow of full movement taking place at one of those joints without
 their mechanically and passively pulling on their attachment on the
 other side of the other joint or joints. In the fore-limb this difficulty
 ¦was  chiefly encountered in connexion with the triceps, as when
 traction was made on this muscle, in addition to extension at the
 elbow joint, there resulted extension of all the lower segments of the

             the Lumbo-Sacral Plexus of Macacus rhesus.               251
 limb, owing to the arrangement of the muscles      as has been explained
 above.   So troublesome   was this action when the movements at the
 wrist and digital joints were being studied, that an instrument was
 devised to exclude the action of the triceps under these circumstances.
 In the posterior extremity, the action of the qnadratus femoris
 tends to produce, besides extension at the knee, extension at the ankle
 and of the digits. This action of the extensor muscle of the knee,
though well marked in the dog, is much less so in the monkey, so
that an assistant could fix the limb in such a position as to exclude
this action without the aid of an instrument. It is obviously of
great importance that this action of a muscle indirectly upon joints
on which it has no direct action should be clearly recognised in all
investigations of the movements at a given joint when any single
nerve root is stimulated.    If one muscle can directly or indirectly
produce   movements    at so  many joints, it is clear that we must first
eliminate indirect effects of the action of this muscle before we can
study the movements at these joints, as produced by the muscles
which act directly on them, otherwise we should be led into
error.
                           Operative Procedure.
   a.  Operation. —In every experiment the animal was narcotised by
causing it to inhale ether ; it was kept deeply under the influence of
the anaesthetic during the whole of the experiment, and killed by an
overdose of it at the end, except in those experiments in which the
animals were allowed to live for some weeks for the study of the effect
of section of nerve roots on its mode of progression and standing,
and also to allow sufficient time for the degeneration in the peri
pheral nerves, consequent on such section of a nerve root, to develop.
In these instances the operation, which was always a very trivial
one, was done under strict antiseptic precautions, and the small
wound afterwards dressed antiseptically.         The animals were, of
course, narcotised in these as in the other class of experiments.    The
neural canal was first opened, a ligature passed round the motor and
sensory portions of a given nerve root together, as close to the
spinal cord as possible, after which the two portions of the root were
divided between the ligature and the cord.           When the separate
bundles of nerve fibres of which a nerve root is composed were
under investigation, the whole root was dissected out to a varying
distance beyond its point of exit from the neural canal, so as to allow
of each separate bundle being separated from the others contained in
a nerve root, for as long a distance as possible, in order to prevent
diffusion of the current from one bundle of nerve fibres to another
during the excitation experiments.
   In those experiments in which the muscles were exposed by dis-

252          Mr.   J. S.  R. Russell,     On tlie Nerve Roots of
 section, in order to allow of their being directly observed in action
 when a nerve root was excited, the spinal cord was always first
divided transversely in the mid-dorsal region, so as to preclude
all possibility of the animal's being conscious of any pain, a possi
 bility most remote, seeing that it was always kept profoundly under
the influence of the anajsthetic in this as in all other experiments on
the nerve roots.
   When intravenous injections of absinthe were given, a jugular or
femoral vein was exposed, and a certain quantity of the essential oil
injected into the vein selected, by means of a hypodermic syringe.
    b. Excitation. — The distal portion of the divided motor root was
separated from its sensory fellow, raised in the air by means of a
ligature passed round it, and stimulated by means of fine platinum
electrodes attached to the secondary coil of a du Bois Reymond's
indnctorium supplied by a bichromate cell. Exactly the same appa
ratus was used in excitation of the cortex cerebri (vide infra).
             Division of Subject and Analysis of Results.
                          a.  Division of the Subject.
    As in the previous research,     I approached the question by simple
excitation of the peripheral end of the cut root, and observation of
 the compound movement thus produced forms the first part of the
investigation. The next step was to carry out, if possible, a more
minute analysis of this combined movement, dividing it into its
component factors, e.g., by using minimal currents of excitation,
applied to the separate bundles of nerve fibres contained in the
nerve root.       The strength of current necessary to produce the
maximum effect without diffusing to other nerve roots was found on
the average to be 500 to 600 on Kronecker's inductorium scale.
When minimum strengths of current were used for exciting the
separate bundles of nerve fibres of which a nerve root is composed,
the secondary coil stood at 40 to 50 on Kronecker's inductorium
scale, on an average.       But both these readings naturally varied con
siderably, according     as  the solution in the battery was fresh or old.
    The way in which     I  was led to suppose that each separate natural
bundle of nerve fibres of which a nerve root is composed might repre
sent some simple movement, and that it might be possible to evoke
such a simple movement by exciting these separate bundles of nerve
fibres by minimal strengths of cnrrent, has been fully detailed in my
former paper.       This minute differentiation is not so easily carried
out in the umbo- sacral roots as was found possible in the cervico-
             1
dorsal roots of the dog, owing to the fact that the distance between
the points of exit of the various nerve roots and those where they

             the Lumbo-Sacral Plexus of Macacua i-hesus.                253
combine to form the plexus is in most instances too small to allow of
the minute bundles of nerve fibres being separated from each other
for a sufficient length of their course.      I was always able to differ
entiate several of the movements      in each root, but was never able to
differentiate all in any given root at the same operation.         Another
factor which contributes    to make   this process  of minute differentia
tion so difficult is the delicacy of the nerve roots in the monkey as
compared with those of the dog, as injury of the nerve fibres is more
difficult to prevent in consequence, in the process of their separation
from each other.      With these difficulties to contend with, the pro
cess of differentiation of the various movements was aided by the
division of muscles and tendons.         That is, after it had been ascer
tained that a certain movement at a given joint resulted on excita
tion of a certain bundle of fibres, these muscles or their tendons
were divided, and the same bnndle of nerve fibres again excited in
order to ascertain whether any otfier movement could be produced
at the same joint, e.g., after flexion at a joint had been produced, the
flexor muscles acting on that joint were divided, in order to ascertain
whether any fibres representing extension existed in the bundle of
nerve fibres under investigation.
   This minute differentiation forms therefore the second part of the
investigation.
   Thus far the investigation dealt with movements ; it wis obviously
necessary to pursue the matter further, and to see upon dissection
what individual muscles were innervated by the various roots, or
their parts when successively excited.       This forms the third part of
the work.      As a corollary to this latter question,   I have attempted
to determine to what degree any given root supplies a muscle
when the latter is innervated from more than one root, and whether
any given muscle fibre is possibly supplied from more than one
root.
   The necessity of instituting new experiments in control of the
results   obtained by the foregoing methods led to the institution of
the  following procedures.
   Of these, the first, constituting the fourth part of the investiga
tion, consisted in dividing one or more roots, and then observing
what effect was produced thereby in the direction of alteration
of the natural gait or movement of the limb in progression and
climbing.
   Another control method, the results of which are embodied in the
fifth part, was devised as follows : —A nerve root was divided (in
some cases more than one), general epilepsy was then induced by
intravenous injection of the essentia] oil of absinthe, and the resulting
deficient participation in the fit of the limb in relation with the divided
 root or roots' carefully observed.

    As a corollary to this part of the subject,                I tried whether the
 results obtained by the last method of experimentation are in any
 way altered when the root or roots are divided some weeks pre
 viously, instead of at the time when the epileptic spasms are indnced.
                              b.  Analysis of Results.*
    It was found most convenient and instructive to place together the
results obtained in Parts        I and   II  of the former investigation, and I
see no reason for altering this method of description in detailing the
following results.
    Part I. Compound movements obtained by excitation of the whole
nerve root.
   Part. II. Minute differentiation obtained by excitation of the indi
vidual natural bundles of the nerve root.
    1st Lumbar Root. — No intrinsic movement of the limb.
   2nd Lumbar Root. —No intrinsic movement of the limb.
   3rd Lumbar Root. — Slight flexion at the hip.
   4th Lumbar Root. — Part I. Flexion at the hip, with the thigh
adducted and the leg extended at the knee.
    Part II. (l)fFlexion at the hip.
               (2) Adduction of tho thigh.
               (3) Extension at the knee.
   5th Lumbar Root. — Part          I. Extension of          the  whole limb with
adduction and internal rotation of the thigh and dorsiflexion of the
foot.
   Part   II. (I)   Adduction of the limb.
               (2)  Extension at the knee.
               (3)  Dorsiflexion of the foot.
               (4)  Extension of the digits.
               (5)  Extension of the hallux.
    6th Lumbar Root. — Part I. The limb extended at the hip, adducted
and rotated outwards ; flexed at the knee, with the foot at right
angles and everted at the ankle, the digits and hallux being flexed at
the distal phalangeal joints.
   * These results are based on a large number of experiments, and although varia
tions were met with, the results which appeared to be the most constant are those
given here.
   + The small numbers in brackets denote the bundles from which a different
movement was obtained when such bundles were separated in a nerve root.            Only
thoie'bupdles destined for the supply of muscles of the extremity are noted, which
accounts in part for so few bundles being mentioned in connexion with some roots ;
but the variation in the size of the different roots is also responsible for this.

   Part  III.  Direct Observation (after Dissection) of Muscles thrown into
               action by Excitation of the separate Nerve Boots.
     I next attempted to ascertain as far as possible which muscles are
 thrown into action by stimulation of the several nerve roots. Iu
 exposing the muscles, great care was taken to separate them from
 each other, so that any communicated movement of one muscle to
 another should be avoided, as, unless this is done, it is sometimes
 difficult to be sure whether a particular muscle is contracting, or
  whether the movement observed in it is only communicated to it by
  an adjoining muscle which is in action.
     Two plans were followed in this connexion.       In one, each root was
  successively selected, and all the muscles in action on excitation of it
  were noted, while, in the other, a particular muscle, or group of
  muscles, was kept under observation while all the roots which con
  tributed to the plexus were separately excited.         Thus the results

256         Mr.  J. S. R. Russell.     On tlie Nerve Roots  of
obtained by the one method could be checked by those obtained by
the other.    In my former experiments         I frequently was able to
expose the muscles directly after the animal was killed, because the
nerve roots, at the end of a prolonged experiment, retained their
excitability for a considerable    time, half an hour or more.   In  these
experiments    this plan has been abandoned,        and exposure   of the
muscles during life alone relied on.

   In my'former    paper the question as to whether    a single bundle of
nerve   fibres representing a single simple movement ever remains
distinct in a nerve root during its course to the muscles it supplies
without inosculating with other motor nerve fibres was considered,

258          Mr.  J.  S. R. Russell.    On the Nerve Roots      of
and   evidence in favour of an affirmative reply brought forward.
The results which have been obtained in the present investigation
have been in conformity with this view, so that           I  see no reason to
alter the opinion formerly expressed.
   A further point that was determined in this connexion was the
question whether, when a muscle receives nerve fibres from more
than one nerve root, both nerve roots supply nerve fibres to one and
the same muscle fibre, and evidence was adduced to negative this
possibility.   The following evidence also negatives this view : — The
peroneus longus muscle is supplied with nerve fibres from the 6th
and 7th lumbar nerve roots, and the maximum contraction which can
be evoked on excitation of the 6th root alone was greater than that
evoked by stimulation of the 7th root alone ; but neither effect was
as great as when both roots were simultaneously excited.              Another
muscle chosen in order to test this point was the         sartorius,  which is
supplied by the 3rd and 4th lumbar roots.             When the 3rd root is
excited with a minimal stimulus, the resulting contraction of the
muscle is limited to its upper part, while similar excitation of the
4th root is followed by contraction of its lower part alone.
Part IV {Control). Alteration ,in the Action of      the Posterior  Extremity
    in Progression in Climbing or in Standing         evoked   by Section of a
    Nerve Root.
   The following experiments were performed in order to observe
the effect of divisiou of one or more nerve roots on the movements
of the limb during use in ordinary progression, climbing, &c. I
observed the effects produced by division of a single nerve root,
of two or three consecutive roots, and of two or three alternate
roots on the same side.       In no instance did 1 find that the division
of a single nerve root was followed by any alteration in the
movements of the limb, such as could be detected by running or
climbing, twenty-four hours after the operation.          A variable amount
of paresis or paralysis of certain movements followed section of two
or more nerve roots. Section of two consecutive nerve roots produced
a greater effect than section of two alternate roots on the same side,
an intermediate root being left intact.      The effect in both these cases
depended    on the  size of the roots divided, for even if the roots divided
were two consecutive ones, and caused great impairment of any given
movement, yet the effect noticeable would be much greater if the
roots divided were large than if they were small, for the number of
other movements weakened would be greater with large than with
small roots.    I have never found that the monkey's power of grasping
the wire of its cage- house in climbing, after section of the 1st and
2nd sacral roots, has been impaired in such a manner as to be

              the Lurribo-Sacral Plexus   of Macacus rhesus.          259
detectable, but here again the experiment has not been repeated
sufficiently frequently in the type of monkey in which, according to
Sherrington, the 2nd sacral root supplies a branch to the sciatic
nerve, which supplies the intrinsic muscles of the foot.
   In no case did section of the 1st and 2nd lumbar roots cause any
impairment in the movements of the limb, nor did section of the 2nd
and 3rd in combination. When the 3rd and 4th lumbar roots were
divided on the same side, flexion at the hip was greatly impaired.
Movements at the knee appeared most affected when the 4th and 5th,
or 6th and 7th, lumbar roots were divided together on the same side,
roots which, as we have seen from the stimulation experiments, are
concerned with the movements at the knee. The division of the last
two roots mentioned also produced most effect on the movements at
the ankle.      The movements of the digits were most affected when
the 7th lumbar and 1st sacral roots were divided together, roots
excitation of which produced these movements.         Section of the alter
nate roots, 3rd and 5th, 4th and 6th, 5th and 7th, 6th lumbar and 1st
sacral, in combination, produced very little effect.     In some cases it
was possible to detect slight impairment of movements, but in others
it was extremely difficult to be sure that there was any. If, however,
three alternate roots, such as the 3rd, 5th, and 7th lumbar, or the 4th
and 6tb lumbar and 1st sacral, were divided together on the same
side, tbere was no difficulty in detecting the general impairment of
the movements of the limb.
   In every case there was rapid improvement.         In some this was so
great that   it was difficult to be certain that any impairment of move
ment remained, notably where alternate roots had been divided.           In
others, while most of the movements seemed as well performed as
on the opposite side, impairment of a particular movement at a given
joint remained, this being the case where two or more consecutive
roots had been divided.
   These results are in keeping with those which were obtained in
connexion with the cervico-dorsal nerve roots of the dog.           As in
those experiments, reunion of the divided ends of the nerve roots was
not the cause of the improvement in motor power, as there was not
the slightest sign of any such reunion on post-mortem examination,
and   I have no other explanation to offer for the improvement in
motor power which occurs, other than one of the hypotheses formerly
advanced in explanation of the phenomenon.         One of these suggested
the possibility of a reflex inhibitory effect on the cells of the cortex
cerebri by the section of a norve root or roots, producing at first a
greater degree of paralysis than would result from exclusion of the
nerve root alone.       The other supposed it possible that cortical im
pressions travelling down to the limb and meeting with a block,
owing to the division of the fibres along which they formerly passed,

Fart V (Control).     Influence of Section of Boot or Roots in excluding
    part of   an Epileptic Spasm induced in the Limb by Intravenous
    Injection of Absinthe.
   In this series of experiments an attempt was made to obtain
further information as to the functional relations of the nerve roots
to the muscles they supply, by the following method of experimenta
tion.    A nerve root was first exposed, but not divided ; either a
jugular or femoral vein was exposed, and 2 minims of the essential
oil of absinthe injected into the vein by means of a hypodermic
syringe.    In order to evoke subsequent epileptic attacks in the same
animal, doses of I minim of the oil of absinthe were found sufficient.
In some cases, after several injections of absinthe, the excitability of
the cortex became sufficiently increased to allow of general epilepsy
being evoked by means of the induced current applied to the
motor area of the cortex cerebri, a method which rarely succeeds
in evoking general epilepsy in the monkey under other circum
stances.
   The first observation that was made in every instance was one to
determine the position assumed by the limb during the general con
vulsions which followed the introduction of absinthe into a vein. In
this way it was easy to exclude any error due to injury of any of the
roots during the operation necessary to expose them.         The position
which the limb assumed when all the nerve roots were intact was
one of flexion of thigh on the abdomen, with the leg at right angles
to the thigh at the knee joint, the foot dorsiflexed at the ankle, and
the digits flexed.
   When the 3rd lumbar root was excluded, the position assumed by
the limb was the same as on the opposite side on which all the roots
were intact, with the exception of the flexion of the thigh on the
abdomen being less pronounced.
   Exclusion of the 3rd and 4th lumbar roots allowed          extension at
the hip to predominate over flexion, a result in keeping    with the fact
that excitation of both these roots produced flexion at this joint ;
while exclusion of the 5th lumbar root as well allowed flexion at the
knee to predominate more markedly over extension.        After section of
the  6th lumbar    on the  same side, there was only feeble flexion at the
knee, with extension instead of dorsiflexion of the root and flexion of
the digits.    The only intrinsic movement of the limb during general
convulsions when the 7th lumbar was also divided was adduction
and flexion of the hallux and flexion of the digits, movements which
we have seen resulted on excitation of the lBt sacral root ; and when

             the  Lumbo-Sacral Pkxu* of Macacus rhesus.                 261
this root was also divided no intrinsic movement of the limb conld
be observed during the cortical discharge.
   On excluding the 1st sacral root alone on one side, no tangible
difference in the positions of the limbs on the two sides conld be
detected during the general convulsions evoked by absinthe.
   Exclusion of the 7th lumbar alone caused an increase of flexion at
the hip on that side, owing to the extensors being weakened, while
there was more extension and less flexion at the knee, because the
hamstrings are represented in this root, marked tibial dorsiflexion at
the ankle, as the extensors were enfeebled, and flexion of the digits
at the phalangeal joints.        When the 1st sacral was divided in con
junction with the 7th lumbar root, the limb assumed exactly the
same position as in the last experiment, except that the digits were
not so powerfully flexed, and the hallux was not adducted, move
ments which excitation of these roots evoke.            The marked feature
which    was  noticeable   after division   of the 6th lumbar root, in addi
tion to the two last mentioned, was that there was no sign of move
ment of the digits or hallux during the convulsions, because, of
course, all the roots excitation of which produced movements of these
parts were divided.
   Combined section of the 5th, 6th, and 7th lumbar roots allowed of
flexion at the hip, feeble extension at the knee, and flexion at the
digits, with adduction at the hallux, during the cortical discharge.
The foot remained quite motionless at the ankle joint, as was to be
expected, seeing that excitation of no nerve root other than these
produced movement at this joint.
   Alternate roots were divided in the following combination, and the
position of the limb observed during general convulsions.           The 4th
and 6th lumbar roots divided together caused flexion at the hip to be
less marked, as was flexion at the knee, dorsiflexion at the foot, and
flexion of the digits.      There was thus a weakening of all the move
ments which predominated when all the roots were intact.
   Section of the 5th and 7th lnmbar roots, at the same time, was
responsible for more marked flexion at the hip and knee and dorsi
flexion of the foot.     So that, although one of the roots which supplies
the quadriceps extensor and one of those which supplies the ham
strings was divided, the section of that to the former group of
muscles was attended with the greater result, for it allowed the
remaining flexor root to predominate, so to speak, over the remaining
extensor root to a greater extent than did the two flexors over the
two extensors before any of the roots were divided.
                              Corollary  to Part V.
   It  seemed desirable     to test carefully the question as to whether
section of    a root or   roots  some time previous to that at which the

262          Mr. J. S. R. Russell.     On the Nerve Boots      of
general convulsions were evoked is attended with the same results as
when the section is done at the time when the convulsions are
induced.     I accordingly divided the 4th and 6th lumbar roots on
one side, ten days before the day on which         I  proposed to excite the

cortical discharge ; and divided the same roots on the opposite side
at the time when the general convulsions were evoked.             The result
was that the positions     of the two limbs were identical during the
convulsions. The result of this experiment was confirmed by similar
experiments with different combinations of nerve roots.
    This method of experimentation was first employed by me in the
investigation of the nerve roots which enter into the formation of the
brachial plexus of the dog ; and, as        I  have before pointed out, it
serves the double purpose of being a means of checking the results of
direct stimulation experiments, and of affording us the power of
ascertaining whether elimination of a root does or does not result
in incoordination of the remaining combination of movements.             The
results obtained by its use have abundantly confirmed those obtained
by stimulating the individual nerve roots ; and also prove that the
coordination of the movement produced by the remaining roots is
not in the slightest degree affected by the elimination of one or more
of them.    They also make it clear that there cannot be overflow of
nerve impulses through the spinal centres, at any rate to any great
extent, i.e., impulses which should reach the muscle through the
nerve root that has been divided do not under these circumstances
 reach them by other commissural channels.
                    Discussion of Results.    Conclusions.
    Stimulation Experiments. —A comparison of the results obtained by
Ferrier and Teo, those by Sherrington, and my own, shows that there
is considerable difference of opinion as to which is the highest nerve
root in the lumbar series excitation of which produces movement in
the posterior extremity of the monkey.            We are all agreed that
flexion at the hip is the first movement of the limb evoked as we
excite the lumbar roots from above downwards, but Ferrier and Yeo
regarded the 4th lumbar as the first in the series from above down
 excitation of which caused this movement, whilst Sherrington states
that in both types of plexus which he has described this movement
 was produced by excitation of the 2nd lumbar root, though it was
feeble in the case of the " postfixed
                                        " class of            In no instance

 have   I observed this movement when the 2nd lumbar root was
 stimulated, the 3rd lumbar being the first root in the series from
 above down in which     I  have observed this movement to be repre
 sented.
    Extension at the hip Ferrier and Yeo found represented        in the 5th

               tlie Lumbo-Sacral     Plexus   of Macacus rhesus.          263
lumbar root, while Sherrington and            I have found the 6th lumbar
root to be the first from above in which the movement is represented.
    Extension at the knee Sherrington places as high as the 3rd
lumbar root, while my own observations coincide with those of
Ferrier and Teo, who found the 4th lumbar to be the highest root
in which this movement is represented.
    We are all agreed that flexion of the knee is first represented in
the 6th lumbar root from above, though Sherrington has also found
it represented as high as the 5th lumbar root ; rarely in the " pre
fixed
        " class of
                     plexus, which resembles most the type of plexus         I
have most commonly met with.
    Ferrier and Teo do not mention dorsiflexion at the ankle as pro
duced on excitation of any nerve root, while Sherrington and I are
agreed that the 5th lumbar is the highest in the series in which this
movement is represented.
    We have all found extension at the ankle to be first represented in
the 6th lumbar root from above ; but, while Ferrier and Yeo and              I
find flexion of the hallux and digits first represented in the 6th
lumbar root, Sherrington states that it is first represented in the
5th.
    With regard to the inferior limit of supply to the limb, Ferrier and
Yeo found this to correspond to the 1st sacral nerve root, and this
has been the lowest root of the series from which         I  have been able to
obtain any response in the limb.
                                        "          " class of
    Sherrington found that in the prefixed                    plexus which he
has described, this is the lowest limit of root supply to the limb; but
that in the " postfixed
                            " class this limit extends as low as the 2nd
 sacral nerve root (9th post-thoracic root).
    The number of times I have met with the type of plexus most re
                                  "
 sembling that described as postfixed
                                              "
                                                by Sherrington has not been
 sufficiently frequent to justify my expressing any decided opinion as
 to the inferior limit of root supply to the limb in this class of plexus.
 All  I  can say is that      I have never succeeded in evoking any in
 trinsic movement in the limb by excitation of the 2nd sacral root
 with currents of such strength as elicited movement when applied
 to other nerve roots, or even with currents very much stronger than
 this. Only by using such powerful currents that there could be no
 doubt as to the diffusion of the current beyond the root to which it
 was applied, was      I  ever able to elicit any intrinsic movement in the
 limb.     Further,    I have failed, by most careful minute dissections,
 aided by powerful lenses, to trace any nerve fibres from the 2nd
 sacral nerve root to the sciatic nerve.        Of course the crucial test of
this point would be to divide the 2nd sacral nerve root in this class
of plexus, and observe whether degeneration in the sciatic nerve
 follows. This I have attempted, but unfortunately the animals in
    vol. Lrv.                                                         T

264          Mr. J.  S. R. Russell.    On the Nerve Roots        of
whom    I have  divided the 2nd sacral nerve roots have, np to the pre
sent, had plexuses resembling the " prefixed
                                                      " class. I have great
difficulty in understanding how Sherrington finds any given muscle
represented in so many more nerve roots, as a rule, than             I do, and,
conversely, how he finds so many more muscles, and, in consequence,
movements, represented in certain roots.          As an instance, the tibialis
 anticus is stated to be represented in the 5th, 6th, and 7th lumbar
nerve roots, while   I   have only found it represented in the 5th and 6th
lumbar roots.     Then, again, the 1st sacral nerve root in the " pre
fixed "¦ class of plexus, which corresponds most closely to the type of
plexus I have most commonly met with, is said to produce extension
at the hip with slight rotation outward of the thigh, flexion at the
knee, extension at the ankle, strong flexion and abduction of the
hallux and flexion of the digits in " interosseous " position ; whereas,
like Ferrier and Yeo, the only movements           I  have found most con
                       '
stantly represented in this root have been interosseal flexion of the
digits, with flexion and adduction of the hallux.
                              I
   The only way in which can account for these very great differences
in our results is by supposing that while I have only included those
roots in which a given muscle is most commonly met with, and those
movements, or muscles, most commonly met with in any given root,
Sherrington has included every variation ; for, as an example, all the
movements mentioned by him as represented in the 1st sacral root, I
have found represented in that root in rare instances, but never all
represented together in any single animal. The movements most
commonly met with in any single animal were those already men
tioned, and when variation occurred it consisted in one or other of
the other movements being added to these.
      I
   If am correct in my interpretation of Sherrington's classification
of results,  I cannot help feeling that that which         I have adopted is
more instructive and less likely to lead to confusion.                        ,
   With regard to the question whether the limb plexuses have an
anatomical or physiological significance,       I  find it difficult to believe
that the developmental processes     which  bring about these arrangements
of nerve fibres do so on a purely anatomical basis without regard for
physiological combination.       Because excitation of a given nerve root
with the induced current evokes a movement which may not resemble
a natural one is to me no argument against the possibility that in
this nerve root nerve fibres destined for the supply of certain groups
of muscles are combined in such proportions as they are likely to
be required in certain natural movements.          The point is one which is
exceedingly difficult to test by experiment, and those instituted by
Sherrington with a view to solving this problem do not appear to me
to be conclusive.
   The facts that muscles or groups of muscles are represented in such

              the  Lumbo-Sacral Plexus of Macacus rhesus.              265
different degrees in different nerve roots, and that one group pre
dominates in one root while another predominates in another, lend
strong argument to the probability that the arrangement is in great
measure a functional one. If the arrangement of nerve fibres in the
nerve roots is a purely anatomical one, why should all the fibres
destined for the supply of a given muscle not be contained in the
same nerve root ? What necessity would there be for the division
of the fibres so that one set of them should be contained in one
root, while another set is contained in another ? These points are
strongly opposed to the supposition that such an arrangement has
been brought about without any regard for physiological action.
Then, also, the fact that muscles which are known to act in consort
are represented in the same nerve root is one which it is difficult to
interpret by mere anatomical arrangement without regard for physio
logical laws.
    Contrary to the observations of Sherrington,      I find that the com
pound effect     obtained on electrical excitation of a nerve root may be
resolved into its component factors, when it is found that movements
diametrically opposed to each other may be represented in the same
nerve root, e.g., flexion and extension.
     It seems to me that some of Sherrington's own results point in
this direction ; for although he makes the statement that each small
bundle of nerve fibres in a nerve root represents a miniature root, as
 it were, yet he finds that by using minimal currents differentiation
 was obtained in so far that one simple movement was elicited before
 another as the current was gradually increased in strength. The
 explanation I would offer for the different conclusions come to on this
 point by this observer and myself is that he excited the nerve fibres
 on the proximal side of the intervertebral foramina while I excited
 them on the distal side.      The latter procedure makes it possible ta
 separate the different bundles of nerve fibres contained in a nerve
 root for a greater distance of their course, and thus to avoid more
 effectually the possibility of diffusion of the current from the bundles
  of fibres actually excited to those juxtaposed. I am aware, from my
 own experience, that it is almost impossible to get any differentia
  tions of movements in a nervo root unless the bundles of fibres of
  which it is composed be first traced well beyond the intervertebral
 foramen. That this should be the case is only natural, for what is
 more likely than that the fibres, packed together so closely as are the
 bundles of a nerve root in their passage through an intervertebral
 foramen, should make it very easy for the current applied to one set
  of fibres to diffuse to others in such close contiguity.     That separa
  tion of one bundle of nerve fibres from another for a sufficient dis
  tance in their course is as important a factor in this differentiation
  of simple movements as is the use of minimum currents for excita
                                                                  T 2

266           Mr.  J. B.  R. Russell.       On   the Nerve Roots of
tion in this connexion, is proved by the difficulties met with in ob
taining differentiation in the case of the nerve roots which enter
into the formation of the lumbo-sacral plexus, where the distance
between the points of exit of the nerve roots from the neural canal
and the point where they nnite to form the plexus is not so great as
in the case of the cervico-dorsal roots and the brachial plexns, and
 where, consequently, differentiation is not so easy to effect as in the
latter case. If further proof were needed in support of the fact,
which     I have repeatedly convinced myself and others of, viz., that it
is possible to separate the fibres concerned with one simple move
ment in a nerve root from those concerned with another simple move
ment, nothing conld be more convincing than the results which I
 obtained with regard to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.* In this
 small nerve    I found that it was possible to separate those nerve fibres
concerned     with  abduction from those concerned with adduction of
the vocal cords ; so that electrical excitation of the one set of fibres
 evoked the one movement, while excitation of the other set evoked
 the other movement.         If such differentiation be possible in a nerve
of such small size, how much the more likely is it that it should be
possible in a nerve root of so much greater proportions ; unless it is
argued that the structural arrangement of nerve fibres in a nerve
root differs from that met with in a nerve trunk.            My own observa
 tions leave no doubt in my mind that the structural arrangement in
a nerve root is identical with that met with in a nerve trunk ; and
there is, besides, abundant proof of this from the observations of
others.f
    Such single simple movements bear an almost constant relation to
 the nerve roots, the same movements being, as a rule, found in any
 given root, and such movements always bear the same relation to the
 spinal level, e.g., extension and flexion of the knee are represented
 together in one root, while extension is represented alone in the root
 immediately above this, and flexion is represented alone in the root
 immediately below this.
     Each bundle of nerve fibres, representing a single simple move
 ment in a nerve root, remains distinct in its course to the muscle or
 muscles producing such a movement, without inosculating with other
 motor nerve fibres. Additional evidence in support of this statement
 is supplied by the results obtained in the case of the recurrent laryn
  geal nerve, for in this nerve it was found possible to separate accu
  rately the abductor from the adductor fibres, and to trace them by
  dissection to the abductor or adductor muscles of the larynx.          And

 intact, degeneration resulted in the muscles of corresponding func
tion, and in these alone : those of opposite function showing no sign
of degeneration.
   The group of muscles supplied by any given nerve root occupy
both the anterior and posterior surfaces of the limb ;* in other words,
muscles whose unimpeded action would produce one movement are
represented in the same root as others whose action would produce a
movement diametrically opposite, e.g., the flexor and extensor muscles
of the ankle are represented in the same nerve root.                 In such com
binations certain      muscles      are   always more extensively represented
than others ; so that, with a current sufficiently strong to stimulate
all the fibres in a nerve root equally, certain muscles predominate, in
their action over others.          The 6th lumbar root contains fibres which
supply the    flexors  of  the   digits and fibres which supply the extensors,
and yet when the whole of the fibres in the nerve root are simul
taneously and equally excited flexion of the digits is brought about
owing to the flexor muscles predominating over the extensors.                This
predominance      of   one   group      over   another  does  not  always  obtain,
however, as in the case of the ankle joint, where both the flexors and
extensors are supplied by nerve fibres derived from the 6th lumbar
root ; simultaneous and equal excitation of all the fibres contained
in this root causes the foot to be fixed at right angles at the ankle,
neither the flexors nor the extensors predominating, but the one set
of muscles equalising the action of the opposite set.
    When a certain group of muscles is found to predominate in its
action in one root    it,  as  a  rule, predominates in that root, e.g.,I    have
not met with an       instance     in  which the flexors of the digits did not
predominate      over  the  extensors      in their action when the 6th lumbar
nerve root was     stimulated.
   If the muscles producing flexion of a certain joint predominate in
their action in one root, those producing extension predominate in
another.     This does not, of course, apply only to when both the
opposing groups of muscles are represented in two nerve roots, but
also when they are represented in different nerve roots.                "We have
seen,  for instance,   that   in  the  case   of the ankle joint the muscles pro
ducing dorsiflexion are represented in- the 5th and 6th lumbar nerve
roots, while those producing extension at the same joint are repre
sented in the 6th and 7th lumbar roots.              This being the case, dorsi
flexion  results   on   excitation      of  the  5th lumbar root, and extension
results on excitation of the 7th.
   When two opposed movements are represented in three consecutive
nerve roots, the middle root of the series           isthat in which both move
ments are represented, while the root above contains the one move
ment and that below contains the other.                Sometimes the two move-

 -268           Mr.   J. S. R. Russell.      On the Nerve Roots of
 ments represented in the middle root of the series cancel each other,
 as  it were, so that neither predominates, as in the case of flexion and
 extension at the ankle as represented in the 6th lumbar root.               Bnt
 when the muscles producing the one movement predominate over
 those producing the opposite one, in my experience those muscles
 always predominate in that root, e.g., the flexors of the digits in the
 6th lumbar root.
    As regards the order in which flexion and extension at the various
 joints are represented in their relationship to the spinal level, we
 find the following to be the order in the fore limb of the dog.
                          Flexion at the shoulder.*
                          Flexion at the elbow.
                          Extension at the shoulder.
                          Extension at the wrist.
                          Flexion at the wrist.
                          Extension at the elbow.
                          Extension at the digital joints.
                          Flexion at the digital joints.
 Thus, while flexion is represented at a higher level than extension for
 the upper segments of the limb, the reverse obtains for the lower
 segments of the limb.
    The following is the order of representation of these movements as
 regards the spinal level in the posterior extremity of the dog and
 monkey     : —
                             Flexion at the hip.
                             Extension at the knee.
                             Flexion at the ankle.
                             Extension at the digital joints.
                             Flexion at the knee.
                             Extension at the hip.
                             Extension at the ankle.
                             Flexion at the digital joints.
 Here the arrangement            as regards the segments of the limb is an
 alternate one, flexion of the highest segment coming first, then exten
 sion of the next segment ; while for the lower segments flexion again
 comes first, and is followed by extension           for the next or terminal
 segment of the limbs.
    So that in comparing the order of representation of movements of
 the posterior with that of the anterior extremity it is found that the
 highest segments coincide by having flexion as the highest represen
 tation, but that none of the other segments thus coin cide, until the

joint is called flexion, while the backward movement is called extension.

terminal segments are reached, when extension is represented at a
higher level than flexion in both instances. This is, however, not
strictly accurate, for dorsiflexion at the ankle is strictly analogous to
extension at the wrist ; which leaves two joints alone at which there
is any discord, viz., the elbow and knee.
   It is possible by stimulation of a single bundle of fibres in a nerve
root to produce contraction of a single muscle and it alone ; but this
effect is easier to obtain in the case of the cervico-dorsal roots which
enter into the formation of the brachial plexus than it is in the case of
the roots which combine to form the lambo-sacral plexus, owing to the
difficulty of isolating the separate bundles of nerve fibres of which the
roots are composed for a great enough distance of their course after
their exit from the neural canal, and before they unite to form the
plexus in the case of the lnmbo-sacral roots. The same muscle is
always represented in more than one nerve root, usually two, and to an
                                                      I
unequal extent in these. The only muscle which have met with which
is not represented in more than one nerve root is the tensor fasciae
femoris ; and this agrees with Sherrington's observations with regard
to this muscle.     In coming to the conclusion that the rule is that a
single muscle is represented in neither more nor less than two nerve
roots,I   wish it to be clearly understood that this conclusion is based
upon the results obtained in any single individual of a class under
observation. That, owing to variations, the same muscle may be
found represented in three or even four nerve roots, I do not pretend
to deny ; but what       Icontend is that in the majority of instances a
single muscle is represented in two nerve roots, and that when a
variation is met with with regard to this muscle, it is, as a rule, that
one of the nerve roots in which it is represented is different, rather
than that it is represented in more nerve roots.
   When the same muscle is represented in two nerve roots the
muscle fibres innervated by one root are not innervated by the
 other ; so that only part of the muscle contracts when a single root
is excited.    This part of the muscle may be either one end of    it, one
lateral half of    it, or    asuperficial or deep part of  it, as the case
may be.

   Division of any given nerve root produces paresis of the group of

 being recovered from. The amount of paresis or paralysis produced
is proportional to the number of nerve roots divided; and this again
varies according to whether the roots divided are consecutive or
 alternate ones, the effect being much greater in the former than in
the latter case. That such should be the case     only what was to be

representation           of muscles in the nerve roots are correct ; whereas

not produce paralysis of any one, the tensor fascia? femoris being
excepted.       Such division of one or more nerve roots does not result
in incoordination of the remaining muscular combinations repre

more feeble.

pends    on  the muscular combinations that have been thus thrown out
of action.       And the effect is identical when the root or roots are
divided at the time that the convulsions are evoked, and when they
have been divided some weeks previously, i.e., the position assumed
by the limb on one side of the body in which the root or roots are
divided previously is identical to that assumed by its fellow of the
opposite side, the root or roots of which are divided at the time that
the convulsions are induced.                No incoordination is produced in the
action of the remaining muscular combinations ; and there is no
evidence of overflow of the impulses which ought to travel down the
 divided root into other channels through the spinal centres so as to
reach the muscles by new paths.

to pass to the 4th lumbar root, in the figure,  isin reality a branch which has its
origin from  the 4th lumbar root, and  which,  together  with the  3rd lumbar root,

'•A New Hypothesis concerning Vision."                       By JOHN BERRY
       Haycraft, M.D., D.Sc. Communicated by E. A. Schafer,
      F.R.S. Received February 16,—Read March 2, 1893.
                                       (Abstract.)
   It is suggested that many of the well-known facts of vision can be
more easily understood when studied from the evolutionary stand
point.     The eye is no exception to the general rule, accepted by
evolntionists, that all parts of the         body are gradually evolved under
the environmental conditions of              the species.     Many species are
devoid of a colour sense, but are             able, nevertheless, to distinguish
light from darkness, and where a             colour sense is present it has been
developed in relationship with environmental pigments : these points
have been brought out with especial clearness by Darwin and
Lubbock.       We may infer, therefore, that the visual apparatus of a
colour-seeing species — man, for instance — was at one time only able
to distinguish light from darkness, and that the colours red, yellow,
green, &c, were once seen as grey.               This enables us to understand
why it is- that the outer, less used, parts of the retina are at the
present day colour blind ; this fact fits in at once with our evolution
ary hypothesis.         From the same point of view we may explain why
a minimal stimulus from a red, green, or other coloured object gives
rise merely to the sensation grey — " bei Nacht sind alle Katzen
       "
grau — even when it falls upon the centre of the retina.                  In this
case the minimal stimulus is unable to excite more than the simple
sensation of light, and the quality of this light is not seen. A
parallel may in fact be drawn between sight and hearing and smell,
for we may hear a sound too feebly to assign to it its pitch, and we
may have to sniff a faint odour in order to make out exactly what it
is. But a red, yellow, or green object, very brightly illuminated,
also appears white, and this has been explained in various ingenious
ways.     It is suggested, however, that this is merely a special case of

                   A  New Hypothesis concerning     Vision.            273
 the  law of maximal stimulation, which states that when a stimulus
 is increased beyond a certain amount it is not followed by any in
  creased sensory effect.    If you illuminate, say, a piece of red paper
 with an intensely brilliant light, it appears white, for the red pig
 ment is unable to absorb all the blue and green spectral rays, which
it would be able to do by a medium illumination, and enoug h of
these green and blue rays are reflected to produce a maximum effect,
 and the red and yellow rays, though no doubt falling in greater
quantity on the retina, produce likewise their full sensory effect and
no more.
    As the eye has been evolved by the action of the common
pigments of nature, their examination throws light upon some of
the facts of vision, and the sensory results of stimuli composed of
certain mixtures of spectral rays may be explained from the evolu
tionary standpoint.      If spectral rays near to each other, such as red
and green, be mixed,      their colour is that of the spectral ray which
lies between them, in this case yellow.      Now, when common natural
pigments are observed spectroscopically, they are seen to transmit
broad bands of spectral rays, generally extending to parts of the
spectrum other than that part which corresponds in colour to that
 of the pigment.      Thus a yellow natural pigment transmits a full
 flood of red, yellow, and green spectral rays.       If we put it another
 way, the sensation yellow has in the course of evolution been produced
 by pigments which stimulate the eye by yellow spectral ray plus
 red and green spectral rays.     These red and green spectral rays given
 out by natural pigments do not give rise to their respective sensations
 when mixed, for there is no such thing as a red-green sensation ; but
 they intensify the yellow sensation which would be produced to a
 less extent by the intermediate yellow ray when acting alone.        It is
a fact, beyond which we cannot go, that the combination red plus
green spectral ray stimulating the eye whenever we regard a yellow
 pigment produces the sensation we call yellow; an artificial mixture
of such spectral rays of course gives rise to the same sensation.
Similar explanations hold for the mixtures of green and violet, &c.
    It is a fact that a sensation of white or grey is produced (a) when
the eye is stimulated by all the spectral rays, (6) when it is stimu
lated, as shown by Helmholtz, by certain pairs, e.g., red and blue-
 green.     It is suggested that the colour top of Maxwell has, as a
physiological experiment, been misinterpreted.          When you mix on
 the disc a blue and yellow and get grey, the blue paper transmits
to the eye one-half of the spectrum, viz., violet, blue, and some
green, and the yellow paper transmits the other half, viz., some
green, yellow, and red. You are therefore looking at what is physically
the same stimulus as that given by a piece of white paper seen in half
light.    That the sensation grey occurs is not to be wondered at, for

274            Messrs. J. H. Cooke and A. S. Woodward.
the same stimuli give rise to the same sensation. That certain pairs of
spectral rays, red and blue-green, for instance, produce grey or white is
quite another fact, and may possibly be explained in the following way.
All    the pairs of spectral rays which together make grey or white
are far apart from each other in the spectrum, and are not present in
rays given out by any saturated pigment.        Thus red and green rays
stimulate the retina when any yellow object is observed, a pigment
which gives out, in addition, the blue-green rays, is of a pale whitish-
yellow.     Thus, while pigments which give out red and green rays
appear more yellow, those which give out red and blue-green rays
appear less so and approach the primitive achromatic sensation.
    Without knowledge of the changes which actually take place
when light falls upon the retina, and before therefore the subject is
really opened up, scientific observers have brought forward complete
 theories of vision. Both in the theory of Young and in that of
 Hering the visual organ is " conceived " by them, and in the absence
 of facts these theories can only be looked upon as tentative.    In this
paper an attempt has been made to arrange new facts by the side of
old ones, in order that they may be understood the better.       Beyond
the point at which it is possible to explain a subject in terms of what
 we already know in physics and physiology, no progress has been
 attempted.      Such attempts have in other departments of physiology
 proved too often unsuccessful to encourage effort in a subject the
 threshold of which every physiologist will agree that we are only
 about to enter.
 " The Har Dalam Cavern, Malta, and its Fossiliferous Con
        tents."   By John H. Cooke, F.G.S. With a Report on
        the Organic Remains,         by Arthur Smith Woodward,
        F.L.S., F.U.S., F.Z.S. Communicated by Henry Wood
        ward, LL.D., F.R.S., V.P.G.S. Received February 2 —
        Read February 23, 1893.
                                 (Abstract.)
     The Har Dalam cave is situated in the eastern part of the island of
 Malta, near Marsa Scirocco Bay. The headlands around the bay are
 composed of Lower Coralline Limestone, capped by Globigerina Lime
  stone. Numerous valleys intersect the land at right angles to the
  coast line, forming small creeks and bays at their embouchure.
     The Har Dalam gorge, in which the cavern is situated, is a valley
  of erosion which carries off the drainage of the land above, and was
  no doubt excavated at a time when the rainfall of Malta was much
  greater than at present.    This is indicated by the heaps of rounded

             The Har Dalam     Cavern, Malta, and its Contents.        275
boulders and water-worn dSbris in the gorge, and by the groovings
and flutings on the rocks along its steep sides.
    The cavern is situated 500 yds. from the shore on the north side
of the gorge, and consistsof a main gallery 400 ft. in length, when it
ramifies in various directions, forming smaller tunnels and chambers,
which follow the jointings and the bedding planes of the rock.         One
branch fissure is 250 ft. in length, 15 ft. high, and just wide enough
for a man to pass along it, widening out at intervals into dome-
shaped rock chambers.       Two of the other galleries are of considerable
length,    but most  do not exceed 20 ft. in length.  One was traced for
35 ft., and ended in a fissure ; another, having a N.E. course for about
 100 ft., ended in a rounded extremity.        They were filled to within
 1 ft. 6 in. or 2 ft. of the roof with a reddish plastic clay, kept moist
 by percolation from the roof. The sides of all the 'galleries are in
 places encrusted with a stalactitic lining, generally obscured by a
 coating of clay.
     The mouth of the main gallery is 26 ft. wide and 10 ft. high, and
 has been used during late years as a cattle shelter, the entrance being
 walled up and provided with a doorway.         It widens inwards into a
 spacious chamber 60 ft. wide and 17 ft. high, having a branch to the
 right hand extending for 10 ft., but filled to the roof with boulders.
 The total length of the cave, including the terminal fissure, is 700 ft.
 The roof and sides are irregularly and smoothly arched, but the
 height and width vary considerably, as shown by section and plan.
      The stalactites which largely covered the roof have been mostly
 broken ofi" by later torrential action, but the larger ones, 3 to 6 ft. in
  circumference, still remain in situ. Raised bosses of stalagmite on
  the floor correspond with the stalactites above.      These stal.igmitic
  bosses were observed at three different levels, each being covered by
  fresh alluvial deposits, indicating the intermittent character of the
  floods that invaded the cavern and the long periods that elapsed
  between them.
      The present floor of the main gallery is fairly even. After enter
  ing there is a rapid descent, followed by a gentle rise to the extreme
  end of the gallery. The deposits met with vary considerably in
  different parts of the cave. At the furthest extremity they are mainly
  composed of red loam; in the middle, of large boulders and broken
  stalactites and old pottery enclosed in clay ; towards the entrance, of
  a grey indurated marl, with abundant remains of land shells, roots of
  plants, bones of Deer, and boulders. The cave is everywhere strewn
   with enormous quantities of water-worn boulders similar to those
   met with so abundantly in the valleys and gorges of the islands.
      Excavations show that the sides of the cave slope inwards, and
   form a trough-like rift of very irregular outline and much broken and
   fissured.

276           Messrs. J. H. Cooke and A. S. Woodward.
   It is the author's opinion that the cave owes its present dimen
sions to the same torrential 'waters which widened the gorge and
moulded and channeled the rocky sides of both.
   It must have been repeatedly submerged, and its sides became
coated by the muddy waters with the clay now adhering to them.
   These torrential inundations no doubt caused the death and en
tombment of the Hippopotami, Deer, and other animals, whose remains,
commingled with boulders and broken-off stalactites, attest the turbu
lence of the waters.
   Eight excavations were made in various parts of the cavern, of
which ground plans and sections are given by the author.
   Trench   I was opened on the right-hand side of the main gallery,
350 ft. from the entrance.
   It was 24 ft. in length, 8 to 9 ft. in width, and 8 ft. 6 in. in depth.
It gave the following deposits in descending order : —
   A. Floor earth with stones, clay, and boulders (unstratified),
6 in.
   B. Red clayey loam (3 ft. in thickness), containing bones of Hippo
potami (H. Pentlandi), teeth and bones of Gervus, the bones very
irregularly distributed ; also some fragments of ancient pottery.
   C- Layer of black earth (4 in. thick), like coarse oatmeal, quite
unfossiliferous, but very persistent throughout.
   D. Dark red plastic clay (1 ft. 6 in. thick), with many remains of
Hippopotamus Pentlandi in good preservation and less disassociated.
Although well preserved, however, they were so soft from the drip
ping of water that they would not bear handling.
   E. Layer of reddish clay (1 ft. thick) full of bones, jaws, and teeth
of a small Hippopotamus, cemented together by calcareous infiltra
tions, and forming an ossiferous breccia (very compact).          A single
molar of Elephas (E. mnaidriensis) was found here.
   F. Stratum of stiff yellow plastic clay (2 ft. thick), unfossiliferous,
but enclosing a few angular fragments of limestone fallen from the
roof.
   Trench   II, also on the right-hand side of the cave, but nearer to
the entrance, showed a series of ten regularly stratified layers, mostly
alternating layers of clay and grey calcareous marly earth.
   The upper layers contained    no organisms, but the red-marly earth
contained   numerous   remains  of antlers of Deer and abundance of land
shells (but mostly broken) ; beneath this series, and separated by a
seam of marly earth, is a bed of red clay (3 ft. thick), containing
antlers,  teeth, and bones of Deer, and remains of Hippopotamus, very
well preserved.
   Trench I IT, midway, in the centre of the floor of the cave: this
trench reached the rock at 0 ft. 6 in. from the surface.     Immediately
in contact with it is a layer of dark red clay, with broken bones of

            The  Har Dalam     Cavern,  Malta, and its Contents.      277
Hippopotamus, but no Deer.       The fissures in the rock itself also con
tained remains of Hippopotamus firmly wedged and cemented into
them.
    Trench IV, also in the centre of the cave, exhibited a series of
deposits similar to those in Nos.   I  and III.
    Layers   A, B,  and  C, in  descending order, contained no organic
remains, but in layer D (indurated brick-red earth), which appears
to be the basal layer of C, composed of its heavier materials, sorted
by water, are remains of Hippopotamus and Gervus intermixed in pell-
mell confusion. Amongst these remains Mr. Arthur Smith Wood
ward has determined the third metacarpal of Man. It was found at
 depth of 3 ft. 6 in. from the surface, and underlying a layer contain
ing pottery. It is probably of great antiquity, being extracted from
one of the earliest layers in the cavern.      The layer beneath contains
bones of Cervidse and Hippopotami, but much broken.
    Trench V was in a rocky fissure on the left-hand and furthest from
the entrance of any of the trenches.       It was excavated to a depth of
8 ft., 'but few organic remains were met with in it ; there were many
limestone boulders, some fragments of pottery, and several pieces of
bones of Hippopotamus.
    Trench VI, made on the left hand, 50 ft. from the entrance, is
interesting because, in layer E, consisting of light gray clay and
loam, with a few antlers, teeth, and bones of Gervus, was found the
 first Carnivore yet met with in Malta; represented by a jaw and
several canines of TJrsus.
    In the layer beneath were numerous bones and teeth of the small
Hippopotamus.
    Although Admiral Spratt and Dr. Leith- Adams refer to the prob
able presence of Carnivora (from the gnawed condition of the bones
in the Zebbng gorge), these are the first remains ever met with.
    Trench   VII  was cut in a small branch cavern, running about 15 ft.
into the rock at right angles to the main gallery, about 20 ft. from
the main entrance.
    Here, beneath a mass of boulders, was a layer of dry black earth,
 intermixed with grass, and fragments of pottery.
    The layer beneath contained large blocks of limestone embedded in
light friable marl, with great quantities of shells of Helices, jaws and
 bones of Sheep, &c.
    Trench VIII, made within a walled enclosure 30 ft. from the
entrance, was not rich in organic remains ; but antlers and limb-
bones of Deer and remains of Hippopotamus marked the corresponding
layers met with in the other trenches.
    The author concludes that the Har Dalam Valley is identical in its
 characteristics with the other valleys and gorges of Malta and Gozo,
and that they all owe their origin to analogous causes : chiefly, he

 thinks, to the action of marine erosion during a period of depression
 and of re-elevation ; bnt not altogether to this cause.
    The limited extent of the present land area, and of the annual rain
 fall it enjoys, would certainly not afford fresh water for a stream
 sufficient to cut out these gorges (often hundreds of feet in vertical
 depth).    The author therefore considers they must date back to a
 period when these islands formed part of a much larger (indeed a
 continental) area, and that the rainfall must have been much greater
 than it is at the present time.
    That during periods of torrential rains entire herds of Herbivora
 must have been drowned, and their carcasses swept into the gorge,
and thence into the Har Dalam and other caves, where their remains
 were embedded.
    In evidence of the great antiquity of these deposits, he points to
 the fact that the mouth of the cave is now 40 ft. above the bed of the
 small stream which, in rainy weather, flows through the gorge, and
 that no torrential waters now sweep through it ; and, further, that the
cutting down of 40 ft. of rock must have been an extremely slow and
 gradual process, and have taken place since the last cave layer was
 deposited.
    Of the pottery, two well marked kinds were observed : the one, a
 rude, coarse, unornamented fabric ; the other, finer in texture, and
characterised by markings similar to those found on ware which occurs
 in tombs at Malta, and known to be of Phoenician and Punic origin.
    The earlier kind is within   2  or 3  ft. of the surface     ; the later, only
 in the superficial layers.

                               Ursus arctos (?).
   The only remains of Carnivora discovered in the cave earth (Exca
vation No. VI, layer ii) comprise the imperfect left mandibular
ramus and left lower canine of a small Bear, and another canine
 tooth equalling in size that of a Wolf. The mandibular ramus of the
 Bear belongs to a fully adult, perhaps aged animal, the permanent
 dentition being well worn ; and the detached canine indicates a
mandible of the same size.           There is a small socket behind the
canine for pm. 1 ; and pm. 4 is well developed, but without any inner
tubercle beyond a rudiment anteriorly.           The length of the diastema
is 0-038, and the teeth preserved measure in length respectively as
follows* : —

in reference to the present fossil is that it does not represent                               a
dwarfed form of the extinct Cave Bear.    This is proved by the com
paratively simple character of pm.     The        -A.

and hence the Maltese form may be provisionally assigned to this
species until the discovery of further remains.    The jaw     much                  is
smaller than those from the Gibraltar caverns assigned by Busk to a
variety between Ursus          arctos and U.      fossilis.
                                          Canis    sp.
  The small canine tooth already referred to belongs to the left side
of the mandible, and probably represents a species of Canis equalling
the Wolf in size. "Whether or not           referable to a domestic

 covered.     Of the humerus, which belongs to the left side, the distal
  two-thirds of the shaft is alone preserved without either extremity ;
  and it can only be said that the bone indicates an animal of the size
 of Hlephas mnaidriensis.        To this species, however, may be ascribed
  with certainty the molar tooth, which resembles in all respects the
  upper molar 2, as described by Leith Adams.        The tooth is worn and
 fixed in a fragment of the jaw, but its anterior portion has been
 broken away beyond the fourth plate.
                           Hippopotamus Pentlandi.
    Bones and portions of dentition of Hippopotamus form nearly the
 whole of the collection of remains from the cave earth ; and it is
 noteworthy that nearly all these remains pertain to adult animals.
 They are much broken, and very similar in character to the bones
and teeth of Hippopotamus Pentlandi         discovered by Dr. Falconer in
 the Grotta di Maccagnone,          Sicily.  There can be no hesitation,
indeed, in assigning the Maltese form to this species ; and the follow
 ing few maximum measurements, made so far as the fragmentary
bones will allow, indicate its small dimensions as compared with

                                Cervine Remains.
    From a superficial layer of the cave earth in excavation No. IV,
numerous much mineralised remains of Deer of various sizes were
obtained.     All the bones and antlers are rolled and too fragmentary
for specific determination ; but the majority may well have belonged
to the Barbary Deer, of which there is good evidence in the over
lying deposit. Several fragments prove that the antlers were not shed
specimens, and one base exhibits the insertion of two brow tynes such
as characterise the adult G. elaphus.
    Other fragmentary Cervine remains, including one pedicle and burr
of antler, were discovered in the cave earth in Excavation No. VI

             The   Ear Dalam      Cavern, Malta, and its Contents.        281

potamus, and bones of Deer also occurred in association with the
mandible of Bear noticed above (Excavation No. VI, layer ii).
                                 Human Remains.
     A  single human metacarpal       III  is also contained in the collection
from the superficial layer of cave earth in Excavation No. IV. It is
mineralised apparently to a somewhat less extent than the associated
bones of animals.
                           II.  Superficial Deposits.
                           Man and Domestic Animals.
     Associated with the rude pottery discovered in the surface deposit
in Excavations Nos.       II  and IV are various traces of a small Pig and
a Goat or Sheep, besides a single tooth of Bos.            A Deer larger than
 the variety of Barbary Deer mentioned below is also represented by
 numerous limb bones and some teeth. In an equally superficial layer
 in Excavation No. VI there is a single metatarsal of a Dog as large
 as a "Wolf, and an imperfect cannon bone of a very small Horse or
 Donkey.
     Bones of Bats have evidently been accidentally introduced, and
 there are a few fragmentary rolled remains of Hippopotamus derived
 from the Cave Earth.         A few fragments of a small land Chelonian
 also occur.
                         Cervus elaphus, var. barbarus.
     The remarkable accumulation of bones in the dry stalagmitic super
  ficial layer in Excavation No. VI consists almost entirely of remains
  of a small Deer in all stages of growth, perhaps even from the un
  born foetus onwards.       None of the bones exhibit evidence of gnaw
  ing or artificial fracture, and although some of the shed antlers appear
  to have been gnawed, it is probable that these have been bitten by the
  Deer themselves in accordance with their usual custom.
     Nearly all the antlers are distinctly shed specimens, and the largest
 complete example measures 0'63 in total length of the beam.              This
 antler bears two short brow tynes, and shows only one bifurcation of
 the beam above; but the terminal fragment of another specimen,
 evidently of an older individual, exhibits a second bifurcation at the
 apex of the beam.          There is no evidence in any fragment of an
 expanded     crown   or palm. Some of the smaller antlers have only one
 brow tyne, and in one malformed case this is abnormally bifurcated.
 A simple pricket, wanting the extreme tip, measures 0'2 in length.
 The surface in all specimens is more or less ridged and furrowed
 longitudinally, and there is a slight burr at the base.

   The small dimensions of all these Cervine remains suggest    a com
parison at first with the common Fallow Deer (Cervus dama) ; and it
is quite possible that some specimens — notably those from Excavation
No. IV — may represent this southern European form, which has
already been recognised by Busk in the caverns of Gibraltar.        The
limb bones, however, appear to the present writer to be slightly more
robust than those of the Fallow Deer of corresponding size ; and the
antlers conclusively prove that most of the remains, at any rate, do
not belong to this species.       The antlers may be assigned with
certainty  to the  small variety of Cervus elaphus which now lives in
Northern Africa, and is known as the Barbary Deer {Genius barbarus
of Gray) ; the Maltese fossils, however, indicate an animal of smaller
dimensions than its existing representative and its contemporaneous
ally discovered in the caverns of Gibraltar.

   This investigation was begun under the instructions of Lord
Kelvin about a year ago, and has been continued since the beginning
of last year in conjunction with another on thermal conductivity,
for which a grant of £50 was made from the Government Research
Fund.
   The chief object of the investigation was to obtain quantitative
results of the variations of specific resistances of metals due to
stretching, twisting, drawing through holes in a steel plate, hammer
ing, heating, and combinations of these, while in some of these cases
the alteration of density was also measured.
   The most exhaustive results that have been hitherto given in this
direction are those of Lord Kelvin, published in vol. 2 of his Be

   As this work was done at two different periods of time, it has been
found convenient to divide the paper into two parts.           Part I, which
contains the results of change of density due to the different kinds of
treatment, was done previous to last July.           Part  II   contains the
results of alteration of resistance due to stretching, the preliminary
work and trial methods, which occupied a very considerable time,
having been done in conjunction with the work of Part I.

                                  Density.
   As, in every case, the alterations were expected to be small, great
care had to be taken to have all the apparatus as sensitive as possible.
A very delicate Oertling balance was used, capable of weighing
accurately to within -j^ milligramme, and all the usual precautions
observed.
                            Effect of Stretching.
   A well-annealed wire of practically         pure copper, electrical con
ductivity 98 per cent., diameter 2 mm., was stretched by weights till
it broke. The wire was securely fixed to a strong hook near the
ceiling of the laboratory, and two ink marks made, one near the top
end, the other near the bottom end.        Behind these marks were fixed
•^-mm.
         scales, which enabled the stretching to be recorded.          After
the wire had been stretched by a weight, a length of about 8 inches
was cut off. In this manner successive weights were applied, pieces
of the wire being cut off each time, till it broke. Even when so great
lengths as 8 inches were taken however, it was found very difficult
to weigh very accurately in water, and this, along with possible
differences, due to the manner in which the several tests were made,
may account for the fact that the intermediate values of the densities
varied in different series. The original and final densities of the
 wire could always be determined very accurately, as much greater
lengths of the wire could be used. The numbers below give the
 values, which were found to be very constant in all the specimens
 tested.

          Original density before stretching           = B'8612
          Density after stretching almost to breaking   as 8'8187
   This shows a decrease in density of fully £ per cent., and is some
what greater than what Mr. Tomlinson obtained for the copper which
he tested, his result being ^ per cent.       In the present tests, the
stretching obtained was usually about 25 or 26 per cent, before
breaking.     Diagram 1 is a stress-strain curve of the copper wire
used, the abscissas denoting percentage strain, the ordinates the stress
in kilogrammes per square centimetre of the original section of the
wire. This curve is given to show the nature of the wire.
   Lead Wire. —A similar series of tests was made on a length of
lead wire, diameter 0'8 mm., the stretching being carried on till the
 wire broke.     This point was reached after a stretching of 36 per
cent.     The values for the original and final densities are as
follows : —

               Effect of Drawing through Holes           in a Steel Plate.
   Copper Wire. —A .length of the same copper wire as was used
before, diameter 2 mm., was drawn, without any special care, through
twenty holes of uniformly diminishing diameters, the density being
measured after drawing through every third hole.                            I
                                                                     Table gives the
results obtained.         It will be seen that, whereas             in stretching the
density was diminished, in drawing it is considerably increased.
There would seem to be a maximum after drawing through twelve
holes, but as the wire became very difficult to draw by this time, and
broke after being put through six more holes, the subsequent decrease
in density may have been due to flaws in the metal, caused by the
rough treatment which it had received.                 The ultimate diameter was
1*8 mm.

   complete turns were made in the wire, the density being measured
   after 200 turns, and again after 300 turns. It was found that the
   wire had stretched by about 23 per cent, after being thus treated.

 density could be brought back to its original value which it had
 before being twisted.            The heating, however, did not seem to alter

                  Tests on Change   of Electrical Resistance.
   Several methods were tried with more or less success at the begin
ning of the work of Part I.        Great difficulty was at first experienced
with thermo-electric currents and the self-induction of some of the
coils used. Ultimately, the zero method about to be described was
perfected, and was used in the work of Part II, giving great satis
faction.
   Before describing this method, we wish to refer particularly to the
two definitions of specific resistance at present employed.            The unit
most generally understood in English treatises is the resistance in
ohms of a cube of the metal of unit section and unit length.               From
this definition we have, for the resistance R, of a length I, of a
homogeneous conductor of uniform section w,
                                  R =    avljw,
where a, is the specific resistance       so defined,       a, may be called the
" volume    specific resistance,"    in  contradistinction to the " weight
specific  resistance " a„, which is defined         from the following.      We
have
                        p

                                                      to
where atp = <rK, w being the -weight of the length I of the wire.
From this, <r„ is seen to be the resistance of a length of the wire
numerically equal to p and section unity, or of a length unity and
section equal to l/p.     Since the section is uniform, Ijw, or the length
per unit of weight, is constant. Let it be represented by X. Then
we have
                                  R =    <Tw\l.
The advantages of using this latter equation over the one involving
the " volume specific resistance
                                      " are
                                                very many, either when it is
required to know the whole resistance of a wire, having given am, \,
and Z, or when it is required to know aw, having given R,            \ and I.
   It is quite usual in commercial circles to speak of a wire of, say,
number 14 gauge, weighing 127 grains to the foot, that is, about
27 grammes to the metre.         The only measurement to be taken then
is the length, if the specific resistance be given in weight units, and
the measurement of the length can be made with the greatest
accuracy.     Even if the weight per unit of length be not given, it can
also be determined most accurately without any difficulty.
   If, however, the specific resistance be given in volume units, the

           Effects of Mechanical Stress on Electrical Resistance.   289
section of the wire must be measured, and this is a very difficult
thing to do, even in the case of moderately    thick wires, when
accuracy is required, since an error in the measurement of the
diameter is more than doubled in the value of the section. Everyone
who has tried to measure accurately the diameters of wires is well
aware of the great difficulty in doing so. Even although the one
measurement were quite accurate, the diameter at the place measured
would, in all probability, not be the average diameter of the wire.
This can, of course, be corrected by taking measurements at a
number    of places, and taking the average, but the process is very-
tedious,  and, when done, is not thoroughly trustworthy, for it is
so easy to make errors in using the ordinary micrometer gauge.       If
the section be determined by the longer method from a measurement
of the density, it is, of course, more accurately obtained, but, even
then, the weighing in water of small lengths of wire is an uncertain
thing ; whereas, for the length per unit of weight, the weighing has
only to be made in air, and therefore the error due to weighing in
water is avoided.     Clearly, then, the
                                         " weight specific resistance "
gives much more accurate results for the total resistance of a wire
than the " volume specific resistance," particularly in the case of
practical work, where very little care is taken in measaring the
diameter.    Certainly, it would have been incomparably more difficult,
and would have taken a much longer time to obtain the results given
in this paper, had the " volume specific resistance " been used. As
will be shown further on, it is not necessary, for mere comparison of
two specific resistances, even to measure the length per unit of
weight.
   Dr. A. Matthiessen, F.R.S., in his paper " On the Specific Resist
ance of Metals in terms of the British Association Unit (1864) of
Electric Resistance, &c." (' Phil. Mag.,' May, 1865), says : —
   " We
          employed the length weight in preference to the length
section, knowing that the weight of a wire may be much more accu
rately determined than its section, whether deduced directly from the
measurements of the diameter, or indirectly from the specific gravity,
the determination of the latter introducing an error. Of course, in
endeavouring to reproduce resistances, it is wise to avoid the use of
unnecessary values ; and it is just as well, and certainly a much more
accurate method, to determine a resistance in length weight than in
length section."
   The term " specific resistance " was introduced by Weber, but by
it he meant the weight unit, and always used it unless when otherwise
stated.   Lord Kelvin points this out in his paper on "Measurement
                                                  "

Electrical Conductivity discovered in Wires of nearly Pore Copper,"
and " On the Electric Conductivity of Commercial Copper of various
kinds," printed in his collected papers, the " weight specific resist
       "
ance     is always used.  Several of the most eminent authorities have
from time to time signified their disapproval of the volume unit, but
it still continues to be most generally used. Why this is so does not
seem clear, for surely a much more definite idea of a metal is
obtained when its density is taken into account as in the weight
unit ; and       for certain purposes, the volume unit may be con
                 if,
venient, this can easily be found from a knowledge of the density.
It has been conclusively established, first by Lord Kelvin, and after
wards by several investigators, that the volume specific resistance
always increases with the decrease of density, and therefore the
weight resistance, since it includes the density, will not change so
much.       The weight unit      not, however, quite constant, as the
                                         is
results of this investigation show, but the changes, at least for
copper, iron, and steel, are very small.     As a matter of fact, for
these metals the volume specific resistance does not change very
much either, as the density is practically constant for any mechanical
treatment.
   The method used for the test of change of specific resistance was a
slight modification of that known as Thomson's (Lord Kelvin)

   The order of       an experiment was as follows: — The test wire BR
was first   of all made as straight as possible by means of a small
weight.     The sliding contact B was then moved about till there
was no deflection in the galvanometer.            Readings were taken at the
points  B,   R,   and   also at a pointer, M,  fixed on the wire near the top
of the bottom scale S. A weight of 7 lbs. was then added to the
small weight, and a balance again taken.               The additional weight
was then taken off, and a balance found.              In this way, successive
additions    of 7  lbs.  were  made, and   balance  readings taken each time
till the wire broke. The distance between the wires was about
10 cm., and the length between B and R from 400 to 450 cm. The
g-alvanometer was made so sensitive that a movement of B of £ mm.
conld be distinctly detected, so that a change of ^ in 4000, that is,
1/160 per cent, was measurable, and allowing for small errors in

292            Messrs.  J. H. Gray and        J. B. Henderson.
reading the knife-edge of B, the result could he easily obtained
correct to -g^ per cent. The method being a zero one, the galvano
meter could be made almost unstable, and, as there are over 23,000
turns on the coil, the arrangement was exceedingly sensitive.         The
maximum current used was 0'5 ampere, and, in the case of iron and
steel wire, not more than 0"25 ampere.
   The four resistances r„ ra, r3, and r4, of 150 ohms each, were care
fully wound anti-inductively side by side on a piece of slate, and
covered with cotton tape, to ensure their being at the same tempera
ture. The whole system of wires was so arranged as not to influence
the galvanometer.      The distance between the standard and test wire
being so small, the temperatures of both were the same, and the
sliding contact, at the point where it had to be touched by the hand,
was protected by a piece of vulcanite from being heated.       With these
precautions,   no inconvenience was experienced from thermo-electric
currents.
                           Calculation     of Results.
   From the method of calculation it will be seen that it was only
necessary to measure lengths in order to obtain results of the varia
tions of the weight specific resistance, and to determine densities in
addition, when the volume resistance was also required. The
measurement of so great lengths as 400 cm. could be made very
accurately, and, therefore, very little error was introduced.      In no-
case was it necessary to measure the section in connexion with the
resistance.
   Let I = original length of the test wire which would give a balance
with the standard, V = the length which would give a balance after
applying weight to it, L = the original length between R and M
before applying weight, w = the section before applying weight,
L', to the corresponding values after applying weight,

      aK = weight specific resistance,
      R = resistance between the points P and Q on the standard.

    Thus,       when    a balance       has been found, it is only necessary to
measure,        by   means of the scales Si S, the lengths Z' and L', the other
two,     I and L, having       been read before the weights were applied.                       The
ratio of the weight              resistances      after     and     before stretching is thus
obtained.          If the ratio of the volume resistances is required, we have
<j'kI<tk = a'Tp'\atp, so that, by cutting off suitable lengths of the wire
and determining their densities,                 we get a',\a,.
    The preliminary trials of this method were made on copper wire
with the help of Mr. Hamilton Wingate.                              The results obtained quite
agreed      with    what     Lord    Kelvin      first,    and     Mr.  Tomlinson afterwards,
found, that the mechanical treatment did not materially affect the
specific resistance.

    tion of specific resistance dne to the strain caused by the weight, and
   the permanent alteration due to the weight having been applied for
   about ten minutes, and then taken off.           This series was coutinued by
   making successive additions of 14 lbs. till the wire broke, which it
   did when a little more than 200 lbs. had been added.                  The results
   obtained for one of four series are given in the table, p. 293. This
   series was chosen because more intermediate readings had been taken
   than in the other three. All four agreed at the common points within
   the limits of accuracy of the method-
       The headings of the columns sufficiently explain what the numbers
  mean.     Column 4 shows that application of weight up to 84 lbs. had
  the effect of slightly improving the permanent electrical quality of
  the steel.     When more than 84 lbs. wero applied the conductivity
  was found to diminish again.            The results in column 2 are shown
  plotted   on  the   curves   in  Diagram 3. Columns 2 and 3 are almost
  identical, as shown by colnmn 4, which is the ratio of the two. The
  numbers in column 4 are, within the accuracy of the method, practi
  cally unity, showing that there has been no permanent alteration of
  specific resistance.       With regard to the points a, a, in each curve,
  which are out to the amount of 5 in 10,000, it must be remarked
 that these were the beginning of the secoDd day's experiments.                    It
  was impossible to carry out a whole series of tests in one day, and,
 therefore, the wire was left over night with a weight of 14 lbs. on it.
      The temporary alteration of specific resistance in the case of steel
 is considerably higher than the temporary or permanent alteration
for copper or iron, as will be seen from the results given for these
metals.
                                 Tests of Copper Wire.
     A very   large number of tests were made on the effect              of stretch
ing on the specific resistance of copper            wire.    The wire was the
same      material    as   that used for tests of density, but of slightly
smaller diameter.         The following table gives the results of one set: —

296             Messrs.  J.   H. Gray and   J. B. Henderson.
    In this   table the percentage stretchings are given instead of the
weights producing the stretching, as, copper being so soft, the effect
of the weights depends altogether on the times daring which they
were applied,      and as these were very variable, a record of the
weights     would   be of no valne.     For example, if a weight were put
on, and allowed to hang for three minutes, then taken off, and a
balance immediately fonnd, and if the same weight be again put on,
left for another three minutes, and a balance again fonnd, it would
be considerably      different from before, showing that the wire had
received an additional stretching.        For this reason it is advisable to
give the percentage stretching produced.         In the case of steel wire it
was quite different,      as,  throughout  all the series, till the wire was
just about to break, the elastic limit was not exceeded, so that the
wire attained its ultimate stretching as soon as the weight was ap
plied. With regard to this table, the results given are one set out
of a great many which agreed very closely, y^ per cent, being
the greatest variations for corresponding stretchings ; this set was
chosen as having one peculiarity very well marked.              This is with
reference to the high value 1"01083, that is, an increase of 1 per cent,
for a stretching of 22'3 per cent. The wire was almost at breaking
point, and, on being examined, the surface was found to contain
numerous cracks, many of which were so large that they could be
easily felt by the fingers.       These cracks were no doubt caused by the
rapidity of stretching, as in other series in which the stretching was
 conducted more slowly they were not so apparent, and the change of
 specific resistance was not so great.
     It was found quite impossible to smoothe out all the little deviations
from perfect straightness in the copper wire.             Although the first
 14 lbs. were sufficient to keep it fairly straight, there were still little
 irregularities which could be seen with the eye. Not till about 56 lbs.
 were applied were these quite removed, and by that time there was
 also considerable stretching. The result was to make the apparent
 initial length shorter than it really was, and therefore the specific
 resistance seemed to diminish at first with the addition of weight.
 After the irregularities were taken out by stretching the length ap
 peared to become greater, while the resistance did not increase, the
 result being that the specific resistance would seem to have dimin
 ished.    This showed itself to a greater or less degree in all the series,
  according to the condition of the wire as to straightness.             The
  values 0'99969, 0'99985 are clearly due to this.       It might, therefore,
  have been more accurate to give the results, taking as the initial
  reading the lengths after the irregularities had been removed ; but
  this would only very slightly alter the values, in fact by -^s per cent.
      Leaving out the value of the alteration just before breaking, wo
  find in all our trials that the greatest increase of weight specific

            Effects       of Mechanical           Stress on Electrical Resistance.               297
resistance        is not more than 0'7 per cent.                   This corroborates, for cop
per,    very     well   what      Lord      Kelvin       found    in   his first experiments on
this subject.            Since the density of the wire diminishes by 0'3 per
cent., the increase of volume specific resistance is about 0-9 per cent.,
a result somewhat higher than Mr. Tomlinson's for the copper which
he used, as he got 0'6 per cent, for the maximum value.                               Wo assume
                                                       "                                   "
that the latter investigator means                        volume specific resistance          by the
term " specific resistance
                                          " otherwise our results would
                                             ;                                        agree more
nearly with his. In any case, it seems quite certain that, in copper,
the greatest alteration that can be produced by any mechanical treat
ment is not more than would be produced by a rise of temperature of
3° Centigrade.

                                      Tests    of Soft Iron Wire.
     The wire, 0'8 mm. here used was exceedingly soft, and gave very
satisfactory results. This metal is intermediate in properties between
copper and steel.                 Whereas in copper the permanent alteration and
stretching begin                 almost        simultaneously with the application of
weight, and in steel the alteration is almost altogether temporary,
that is, only lasts while the weight is on the wire, in soft iron wire
there is both a temporary and permanent alteration.
     The same length of wire was taken as for copper and steel, and
 weights added by 7 lbs. each time, tests being made after each
 addition. A comparison was made of the ratio of the weight specific
 resistance with weight on to that before any weight was applied.
 This gives column 3 in the following table, and shows the ratio duo
 to the sum of the temporary and permanent alterations.

    A comparison was also made of the ratio of tho weight specific
 resistance while the weight was on with that immediately after the
 weight was taken off. The results are given in column 4 of the
 table.   Column 5, which is obtained by dividing the results of
 column 3 by the corresponding numbers in column 4, gives therefore
 the permanent alteration due to stretching.    In this table both the
 weights and the percentage stretchings are given, as it was found
 that with iron the difficulty experienced with copper of continuous
 stretching did not occur.
   In order   to test   if there was any more permanent stretching after
the wire had been allowed to rest for a week, another series of tests was
made on the same wire at the end of the week, readings being taken
on the application of every 7 lbs. as before.  The results showed that
the temporary alteration remained                  the same     as         being for
                                                                     before,

column 2 to get the temporary               alteration, the result being for 49 lbs.
1*00232, shows that the permanent alteration is practically constant
after the first series of stretchings.
   No test's have been made of alloys as yet, as it was thought more
important to give as much time as possible to obtaining trustworthy
results for pure metals.
   The conclusions that have been arrived at from this investigation
are that no mechanical        treatment, such as stretching,     drawing
through holes   in  a steel plate, twisting, hammering,  or combinations
of these, all of which were tried, had any appreciable effect on the
electrical properties of copper, iron, or steel.
   The effect of annealing was also tried on a copper wire which had
already been very much stretched.        The wire was carefully heated to
redness by means of a lamp all along its length, and a test then made.
This was not found to bring its resistance back to its original value
however.
    As contrasted with the small effect that mechanical treatment has
 on the electrical properties of metals, it is interesting to notice the
great influence even a trace of impurity in the metal has.          For this
 purpose we include a table taken          from   Lord   Kelvin's  paper on
 " Analytical and Synthetical Attempts to ascertain the cause of the

   This series was made in order to find            if,
                                           after the wire had been
 stretched almost to breaking and allowed to stand, there would be
 any more permanent alteration         of specific resistance due to renewed
  application of weight. First       of all, a series of stretchings was given
  to the wire, as in the former tests of the same wire. Column         of the
                                                                            2

 former series.
     This wire waa then tested by applying successive weights, the
  readings being taken with weight on and also after the weight had
 been taken off.    Columns (2) and (3) of Table         give the results of
                                                               B
  these tests.   Column (2) shows the ratio of the weight specific
 resistance with the weight on to that before the weights were
 applied for the second series. Column (3) gives the ratio with
 weight off to that before the weights were applied.            Column (2)
 therefore shows the permanent and temporary alteration, and (3)
 shows the permanent alteration.           There was, however, still a
 slight permanent stretching, which accounts for the small increases
 shown in Column (3). The results showed that when there was no
 permanent stretching application of weight only caused temporary
alteration of weight specific resistance.
    The numbers in columns (2) of Tables A and             when plotted on
                                                                   B

   In May,      1892, Mr. Walter Spencer banded over to us the body of
a cat    in which he had discovered a double otitis media. Some of the
pus was immediately inoculated upon gelatine, and two days later it
was seen that the gelatine along the streak had liquefied, whilst the
rest of the surface of the non-liquefied gelatine was covered by a

typical   ones are reproduced, namely, figs. 10, 12, 14, 23, 28.     It has been thought
better, however, to preserve the original numeration in the text, as the original
photographs can be consulted    if necessary.

regular growth of delicate white filaments.              Re-inoculation proved
the presence of more than one micro-organism, but we soon succeeded
in isolating one which did not liquefy the gelatine, and which pre
 sented the exceedingly characteristic feather-like appearance well
known to belong to Bacterium Zopfii.            We were especially struck by
 the beautiful regular upward growth of the filaments upon the
gelatine surface, for whether we placed the tubes with their mouth
pointing upwards or downwards there appeared the same definite
growth, provided the tubes were kept in a nearly vertical position.
"We accordingly immediately commenced an investigation, which we
hoped might throw some light upon the meaning of this very definite
symmetrical growth. With this end in view we first investigated the
action of light, but whether we grew the bacterium in the light or in
the dark, the symmetry remained the same.                 We now began to ob
serve,   however,     that   tubes which,  after  inoculation,   were kept in a
horizontal position exhibited an irregular growth.                   It therefore
occurred to us to test the action of gravity, and we found in effect that
revolving inoculated test-tubes slowly upon the clinostat* produced
irregular growths, whilst centrifugal force induced, like gravity, a
regular growth. Bacterium Zopfii was therefore negatively geotropic.
These phenomena, viewed in the light of the more recent experi
ments upon the chemotactic and phy siotactic properties of protoplasm —
properties which appear already to throw very considerable light upon
certain pathological problems — have led ns to venture to record in
detail our observations.
   Bacterium Zopfii was accidentally discovered by Kurthf in the
alimentary tract of the hen in 1883, and his description of the micro
organism, furnished from Zopf's laboratory, remains the standard
one. In 1885 Professor CrookshankJ obtained from the air in Johne's
laboratory an organism which he named Bacillus figurans on account
of its characteristically figured growth upon gelatine and agar ; it
proved to be identical with Kurth's bacillus. Lastly, as previously
mentioned, we obtained our growth from the middle ear of the cat.
These observations make it very probable that Bacterium Zopfii has a
wide distribution, but whether it is pathogenic or not is still uncertain.
We will, however, return to this point later on.
   Bacterium Zopfii is pleomorphic ; it is a slender organism of about
the same diameter as Bacillus anthracis, and its segments are of very
variable length.         It occurs in the dissociated motile state, the
elements being actively movable coccal, bacteroid, bacillary, and

twisted forms   ; the degree of spirillation in the latter motile forms,
however, appears only very slight, and we have not, as yet, encoun
tered the pronounced spirilla seen in Cladothrix.       It occurs in non-
motile filaments of great length, which may be nnsegmented or seg
mented.      A very striking feature of these filaments is their proneness
to twist, to weave themselves into striking patterns, and to form
aggregating zoogleaform masses, of equally curious shapes.              The
segments of the filaments may occur in the form of cocci, bacteria,
bacilli, vibrios, spirilla, and spirochretse and in the various double
forms of these.      Kurth grew the organism in broth and on gelatine,
and obtained in the former the motile and long filamentous forms,
whilst the twisted varieties appeared wanting : this we likewise have
noted.     In gelatine he found that it caused an imperceptible amonnt
 of liquefaction and grew out in a radiate manner, and formed charac
teristic spirals.    Crookshank grew it upon agar, and obtained a
feather-like growth which he figures ; this, however, we have always
failed to obtain upon that medium.           Kurth drew attention to the
sensitiveness of the organism to changes in temperature, to the
 hindering action of the air, and to the great necessity for plenty of
oxygen.
              The Growth of Bacterium Zopfii upon Gelatine.
    For our experiments      we have always employed the 10 per cent,
gelatine possessing a neutral or faintly alkaline reaction, but we have
found no appreciable difference whether the organism was grown on
 gelatine with faintly alkaline or acidic reactions. We use the ordinary
culture-tnbes, Petri boxes, and a method of plate glass culture which
 we have found exceptionally useful. This method consists in placing
 a small piece of moist cotton wool in the bottom of a test-tube large
 enongh to hold the ordinary 1x3 inch micro-slide ; the test-tube is
 plugged, and the whole sterilised in the steam steriliser at 120° for
 20 minutes.     When cooled, a thin uniform layer of sterilised gelatine
 is very readily spread over the surface of the slide in the test-tube,
 which remains horizontal, by means of the balloon pipette of Pasteur :
 there is no fear of contamination. The test-tube is plugged and
 capped to prevent drying, and the slide is then always ready for
 inoculation. When a streak culture has been made npon the gelatine
 surface, and it is desired to examine the growth, the slide is removed
 and placed in slightly diluted spirit for a few hours, to fix the growth
  and extract the salts.    The slide is then carefully dried, stained for a
  few seconds in gentian violet, washed with Gram's iodine, and nearly
  decolorised in spirit, again dried, mounted in Canada balsam, and
  covered with a sufficiently long cover-slip.      By this method there
  is the least possible disturbance of the growth,, and all our micro

              The Action       of Gravity   upon  Bacterium Zopfii.            303
 photographs have been taken from plates so prepared. The organism
 can always, however, be readily examined npon these gelatine slides
 withont fixing or staining. The method of cover-slip impressions we
 have found not applicable in our case, as the growth is firmly
 embedded in the gelatine ; it is useful, however, in the case of agar.
 For reasons which will be given later, it is necessary to observe
 under the microscope the ordinary test-tube growths in situ in the
gelatine.     For this purpose we rapidly warm the test-tube to just pro
 duce liquefaction of the surface of the gelatine in contact with the
 glass, and then slide it ont upon a glass plate ; a cover-slip is
placed over the surface of the growth, and it can then be examined.
 Another method which we have employed, and one again which does
not lead to any disturbance of the growth, is the well known method
 of drop cultures, but employing gelatine instead of a fluid medium.
    Fig. 1 is a photograph of a 36 hours' growth upon gelatine, the
 result of a streak inoculation (see also fig. 12). The tube was kept
vertical. It is the characteristic growth, i.e., lines passing outwards
and upwards at an angle of about 45° : the appearance is typically
pinnate. In connexion with these vertical streak cultures we have
noticed this very curious phenomenon, that no matter how crooked our
original streak may be, yet the growth seems to form a new perfectly
median axis for itself, from which the rami start; further, if instead
of a vertical streak we make three or four streaks upon the surface of
the gelatine at right angles to the long axis of the test-tube, the
growth still tends to form a median line. These facts, coupled with our
microscopic observations, pointed out to us that we might possibly be
dealing with a branching phase similar to that met with in Glado-
ihrix dichotoma; and, indeed, if we refer to Zopf's* drawings of Clado-
ihrix we do recognize a pinnate arrangement of the so-called false
branches of the filamentous organism.                Billetf has termed this
branched     state     the  " filamentous,"                          "

    We soon found that we did not always obtain the characteristic
growth, even in the test-tube ; not only had the degree of sloping, as
mentioned in the commencement, a considerable effect upon its
regularity, but the temperature also exercises a marked effect. We
obtained the best growths in a temperature of about 21° C. kept
constant.      In this way a perfect growth might be obtained in
24  hours,   whilst     if that portion of the test-tube which corresponded

to the back of the gelatine was painted black, growth was still faster
and might cover the surface in 12 hours.           On the other hand we
found accidentally that a reflecting surface retarded the growth.
Those latter phenomena we attributed to differences of radiation.
    When next we directed our attention to the gelatine cultures on
glass plates and in Petri boxes, we encountered a still greater number
of irregularities.    Upon the glass slides covered with a thin Layer of
gelatine we never     obtained   a good negatively geotropic growth ; the
usual condition was the irregularly branched appearance seen in
figs. 15 and 16 tinder a low power.        For the reasons of this we are
still at a loss, unless it be the increased resistance of the gelatine.   In
the Petri boxes with a thickness of gelatine varying from               \ to
1    inch, or even more, we obtained some instructive results.           We
never     succeeded in getting symmetrical pinnate growths on the
surface comparable to those in test-tubes ; but that we obtained
evidence of geotropism is manifest from the photographs, figs. 2, 3, 4,
5.      In figs. 2 and 4 vertical streaks had been made; in fig. 3, a
circular streak ; and in fig. 5, a cross.       The time occupied in the
formation of these growths was relatively very much longer than in
the case of test-tubes ; moreover the filaments upon the surface rarely
possessed the delicate character of that obtained in test-tube
cultures; they had, in fact, as we shall subsequently see, the
character of zoogleaform threads.         In fig. 6 a horizontal streak has
been made, and although the glass dish was kept vertical, an irre
gular growth has extended for an equal distance both above and
below the horizontal line ; Bacterium Zopfii may, in fact, readily
extend downwards upon a surface, but it always does so in irregular
masses. These results disappointed us at first, until on closer ex
amination we fouud that in every case parallel threads passed into the
gelatine almost invariably at the common angle of 45°.           These geo
tropic    threads  had   formed   just as quickly   as those  found  on the
 surface of the gelatine in the case of test-tube cultures ; indeed,
so rapid is their growth into the gelatine that they may extend a
distance of f to 1 inch in 12 hours.          The symmetrical ingrowing
into the gelatine we had also observed in the case of test-tube
 cultures where the growth upon the surface had been retarded by
lowness of temperature, whilst painting the test-tube black in the
 manner previously referred to appeared to still further increase the
inward growth.        Fig. 7 is a view of the back of an early growth to
 show the regular ingrowing tendency ; but photographs of the more
perfect cases are impossible owing to the extreme delicacy of the
 filaments ; fig. 5 is a later stage of 7.      In fig. 6 the ingrowing is
partially seen, and, as fast as the growth extended upon the surface,
fresh rami projected symmetrically into the gelatine.        We noticed in
 some cases that the filaments, after having penetrated the gelatine

 deflected back parallel to the ingrowing rami.
    Growth upon Agar. — As stated above, we have never obtained a
 symmetrical growth in or upon this medium with or without glycer
 ine.   The growth is that figured in photograph 10. It takes place
 slowly, and the margins are irregular, being formed of scattered
 clumps of the bacterium.
    Growth upon Potato. — Fig. 9 represents a potato culture ; the faintly
 yellowish-white growth is observed to have no definite geotropic
 arrangement. The potato, it will be observed, appears black ; this
 has been produced by means of iodine, a method which we have em
 ployed with success in demonstrating delicate growths upon potato
 surfaces.                               ,

    Growth in Animals. —We have recorded how this micro-organism
 was first discovered by Kurth in the alimentary tract of the hen ;
 whilst in our own case it was present in very great abundance in the
 pus of both the middle ears of the cat.           It is just possible that in
 the latter (present) case the microbe gained access to the ear by the
  Eustachian tube, and therefore that the bacterium was originally in
 the mouth.      It is conceivable, therefore, that it may, in common with
 the numerous other Gladothrix forms, be of more frequent occurrence
 in the mouth than is suspected. We have, however, made no observ
 ation upon this point. We inoculated two rabbits subcutaneously
 without result, and in another case the third of a test-tube full of a
 broth culture was injected into the peritoneum with like lack of
 success.    These few experiments, however, prove little.
    The Action of Oxygen and Carbonic Acid Gas upon Bacterium
 Zopfii. — We have already brought forward sufficient facts to show how
 sensitive this micro-organism is to changes of temperature.             Fig. 11
 represents a three days      old  growth in a test-tube kept in an atmo
 sphere of carbonic acid gas ; there is simply thickening of the
original streak.      Control test-tubes which were placed in oxygen at
 the same time exhibited well marked symmetrical growths from
 12 to 24 hours.      Further, if the tube in which the growth had been
inhibited by the C02 were transferred to oxygen, a symmetrical
growth occurred, as in fig. 12.
    The Action of the Spectrum upon the Growth of Bacterium Zopfii.*—
By means of a Zeiss sub-stage spectroscope a large spectrum was
projected through the micro-photographic camera and focussed upon
a Petri box of gelatine, across which a streak inoculation was made.
From our results so far with gelatine or agar we can only say that

the growth does not appear to be affected by any of the colonrs.
Some of those who have seen our results think there is more growth
towards the blue end       ;  on the other hand, towards the red
                               others,
end.   We ourselves have come to no definite conclusion as yet.
   Microscopic Characters of the Cultures in the various Nutrient Media*
— -The series of photographs which illustrate these points have been
fixed and stained in the gelatine, as previously mentioned.   We have
divided them into three groups. The first group, figs. 15 to 20, repre
sent the filamentous phase of the early growth; fig. 17, for example,
representing the long segments observed in the rapidly growing
pinnate filaments.        Groups   IIand        III
                                              quickly follow upon the first.
Group II, figs. 21 to 23, we venture to call the skein phase, which we
think corresponds to the it at enchevetri of Billet. Group III, figs. 24 —
31, we think represent the zooglea phase.        There yet remains a fourth
group, which we have not represented, and in which the segments
live an independent existence (as partly shown in fig. 18) and very
often are freely motile.      We would call this the dissociated phase, the
e'tat dissocii of Billet.   We have in this system of group phase division,
therefore, followed Billet.* Whether this is a reasonable method of
division will have to be judged from our photographs, from certain
peculiarities exhibited by the above-mentioned groups, and lastly
and chiefly from further examples.
    In figs. 15 and 16, Zeiss obj., mm. 75 without eyepiece, the original
streak of inoculation and the branches which spring from it are seen.
 The streak presents interesting peculiarities. Very slight liquefac
tion of the gelatine may be observed in                it,
                                                   and then very commonly
 swarming obtains; as previously mentioned, the motile segments may
vary very greatly in length. In the figures in question clumps of
bacilli occupy the central streak.          In some cases, however, long
zooglea-like twisted masses, like those seen in fig. 25, run straight
along this streak,    it   thus appearing as       their direction had beeii
                                                       if
 determined by the inoculating needle.          In other cases the central
 streak is   a mass of round zoogleaform collections. It will be seen
 that the micro-photographs in the first group afford very little evi
 dence of the negatively geotropic tendency of the filaments, only the
 slight amount depicted in fig. 15 being often seen.             The thicker
 branches in figs. 15 and 16, and all the branches in figs. 24 and 25,
 have assumed the zoogleaform condition.            The microscopic picture
 presented by the rapidly growing pinnate form differs very markedly
 from these in
             ;   it   nearly all the fibres in the field run parallel to one
 another, the microscopic picture then quite coinciding with the
 microscopic appearance seen, say, in fig.           or 14. In the pinnate

       is      exceedingly difficult to trace the origin of the fibres in the
 central line as well as to follow out the mode of branching; this is

 chiefly owing to the filaments slightly burrowing into the gelatine.
The filaments may be very long and unbranched, but when branching
does occur it appears to bo brought about as in Cladothrix by the
deflection of a segment to one side and subsequent growth.      Soon after
 they are formed the long slender rami exhibit a remarkable proneness
to twist and to segment, and then, to pass into the zoogleaform or, less
 commonly, into the skein phases.      The twisting is very striking, and
 some idea of it can be gathered from figs. 19, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.
 In none of these photos is the spirilliform twist of single filaments
 shown ; it is, however, exceedingly common ; the spiral is neverthe
 less seen in the zooglea phases, figs. 25, 26, 30. There are, therefore,,
 twists in the horizontal plane, and spirilliform twists. Concerning
these twists it appears very remarkable that the majority appear to
 turn inwards, that is, in the opposite direction to the hands of the-
 clock. To this point we will return when discussing the geotropism.
 It will be gathered from the above and from the photos that the
                                              "
 segments may exhibit the "form phases long ago laid stress upon
 by Zopf and Lankester; we need not, therefore, dwell upon them.
 The spiral is a striking feature in all gelatine preparations, but is
 only slightly marked in agar, whilst we have not as yet observed it
in broth ; but, we may add, we have not examined a sufficient
 number of these latter specimens.
    Skein Phases. — The meaning which we wish to convey in this name
is set forth in figs. 21, 22, and 23. We lay no stress upon it, but the
 term is convenient, for it is the form which can, we think, always
 be seen upon agar and stiff gelatine.     It will be seen that it is quite
 unlike the zoogleaform phase. The filaments composing it are not
 held together by a common cementing substance, but are formed by
 plaits taking place in the course of a filament, as seen in figs. 21 and
 19.   Fig. 23 from an agar culture will at once recall the medusiform
 appearance of the anthrax growth.       Its formation appears to be very
 closely related to the stiffness of the medium upon which it is grow
ing, and appears always to occur upon the surface of the medium ; the
 skeins are usually moist, and to the eye present a glistening frosted
 appearance.
    Zoogleaform   Phases. — This is the phase one commonly sees upon
gelatine, and    its striking appearance is well represented in figs.
24  — 31.   Zoogleas are said to result from either the aggregation of
dissociated elements or from the multiplication of segments which
remain where they are formed, being held together by a common
cementing substance.       Of the former mode of formation we have no
experience, and we venture to think that it is not common. If one
turns to the descriptions of the higher bacteria, the impression is
gained that the zooglea masses have resulted from local multiplica
tion ; that this is so in Bacterium Zopfii the photographs show, as

308              Prof. R. Boyce and Mr. A. E. Evans.
well as the experiment of mixing a small quantity of the bacterium
in liquefied sterile gelatine and then pouring it into a Petri dish ; in
the latter case numerous zoogleaform colonies develop in the solid
gelatine, and send out branches which ramify in all directions. The
branching zooglea of Cladothrix dicJwtoma, commonly known as Zooglea
ramigera, follows closely the arrangement           and branching of the
filamentous stage ; similarly, the " linear, globose, arborescent, reti
cular, and tesselated aggregations "• of the Bacterium rubescens of
Lankester probably represent local cell aggregation.         As our figures
show,    the  mode of aggregation leads to various        forms,  but they
usually possess one feature in common, and that is spirillation, and a
large number may be aptly compared to the twisted strands of a rope.
The segments of which they are composed are small bacteroid or
coccal forms, and they appear to be formed by the deflection and
division of the minute segments into which the original single
filaments break up.      They rapidly follow the filamentous growth in
the symmetrical pinnate cultivations ; like the filaments which pre
cede them, they assume the geotropic position.           They may extend
great lengths and be quite unbranched, or branching may occur as in
figs. 30 and 31.     Like the filaments, they form in the gelatine ; we
have not observed them in agar or broth. In fig. 31 a sarcina-like
arrangement of the segments is seen ; this is of interest, because, as
Billet has pointed out, the sarcina of the lower bacteria probably is
the representative of the zooglea phase of the higher bacteria.
   Upon the Phenomenon of Negative Geotropism exhibited by Bacterium
                                    Zopfii.
    If a tube of gelatine is inoculated with a streak culture and kept in
a nearly vertical position, a regular pinnate growth will, in the
majority of cases, be obtained, identical with fig. 1. If a series of
such tubes are placed at intermediate positions between the vertical
and horizontal, it will be found that the growths become more and
more irregular as the horizontal is reached.         These results we have
repeatedly obtained since May, 1892.            But apparent failures do
occur : e.g., if the gelatine is too stiff, an irregular growth results, as
in the case of agar, although the tube is kept vertical ; microscopic
examination of these irregular growths shows the skein phase. Simi
larly, if the temperature is low the symmetry is greatly interfered
with. Experiments in the same manner with Petri boxes give, when
 sloped, the appearance already noticed in figs. 2 to 7. The pinnate
growth is, in these cases, not so striking on the surface as with test-
tube cultures, but, as we have previously remarked, the filaments
 which penetrate the gelatine ran a perfectly parallel course upwards,
 at an angle of about 45°, into the substance of tlie gelatine ; the same

              The Action     of Gravity    upon Bacterium Zopfii.            309
   phenomenon      may   be   observed   in test-tubes,    especially when the
  growth upon the surface        tends to be irregular.       If the Petri boxes
  are kept horizontal, the surface of the gelatine is soon covered with
  a quite uniform growth, in which, if rami can be distinguished, they
  take no particular direction.       If, instead of these boxes, glass plate
  cultures are made, and in which, therefore, the coating of gelatine
  is necessarily thin, a pinnate growth with rami at the angle of about
  45° is never obtained.      The chance of getting a symmetrical growth
  upon a large flat surface is therefore much less than in the case of a
 test-tube. The explanation is difficult. In the test-tube, the surface
 of the gelatine has a slight curvature, and one often notices that
 towards the edge of the Petri dishes, where the gelatine is also
 slightly curved, the growth is more regular.               Inequalities on the
 surface   of  the  gelatine   do  cause  alterations   in  the direction of the
 rami, and in some cases a few of the branches on this account appear
 to take a positive geotropic position.         Thus, in addition to tempera
 ture and consistence of substratum, there are other circumstances
 which may favour or retard a symmetrical growth.
     When test-tubes containing streak cultures are placed upon the
 vertical disc of the clinostat, and revolved at rates between one
 revolution in 2 minutes to 1 in 1 hour, there is in the first place
 a partial absence of the delicate rami seen in vertically sloped
 tubes, and when rami are formed they grow in various directions.
 Fig. 13 shows the irregular growth which first started, and grew over
 the middle area of the gelatine, and then the formation at the
 periphery of delicate rami, which in this case are completely hori
zontal.    If a Petri dish is substituted for the test-tube, the result
depicted in fig. 8 is obtained, a mode of growth which offers a
striking comparison to figs. 2 — 6.           Our results with the clinostat
have been invariably the same, and, therefore, accord with what
Sachs* obtained with the higher plants when the disc of the clinostat
revolved slowly. In his case the direction of growth was neither that
induced by gravity nor by centrifugal force. Having repeated these
experiments very many times, we next tried Knight's experiment
upon the action of centrifugal force upon growing plants.                 In his
paper which was communicated to the Royal Society in 1806, he
showed that, if young plants wero rotated at rates varying between
80 to 250 times in a minute, that the ascending axis of the plant was
centripetal, and the radicle centrifugal. Great was our satisfaction
when we found likewise that the rami of Bacterium Zopfii, which,
from the preceding experiments, we considered negatively geotropic,
took a marked centripetal course when rotated in the horizontal at
the rate of about 240 revolutions per minute.              We obtained, in fact,
as fig. 14 shows, much more symmetrical and beautiful results than
                '• "Wurzburg, Med.-Phys. Gesellsehaft, March, 1872.

in the  case  of gravity.    The angle remains about the same, and oil
microscopic examination the rami are found in nearly all cases strictly
parallel and unbranched.
   Our experiments thus show that we get a pinnate growth of
Bacterium Zopfii when the surface of the medium is kept in or near
 the vertical, or when the culture is rapidly rotated in the horizontal.
 That an irregular growth obtains when the gelatine surface is hori
 zontal, or when it is slowly rotated in the vertical.               That it is
necessary in order to demonstrate the upward growth to have a
suitable temperature and suitable medium, and that other factors,
the nature of which we do not understand, probably likewise influence
 the symmetrical growth.        We would also draw attention to the fact
 that on vertical or nearly vertical gelatine surfaces, an irregular
 growth usually spreads          downwards (compare         fig. 6) upon the
 surface, and that when a horizontal surface of gelatine is inoculated,
 extension of the organism takes place vertically downwards into the
snbstance of the gelatine ; but in neither of these cases are the
well-defined rami present.        The question now remains, is the force
which induces the upward growth of the protoplasmic threads of
Bacterium Zopfii, gravity ?       Rozanoff* brought forward a beautiful
example    of  upward growth      in  one of the Myxomycetes, ^Ethalium.
septicum. He grew it upon a nearly vertical surface of filter paper
through which a very slow stream of water must have been con
stantly passing, as the upper edge of the paper rested in water. He
found that the fungus grew upwards. He repeated Knight's centri
fugal experiment, and found the fungus centripetal ; during this
experiment the filter paper was kept moist with water, and therefore
the latter must have tended to fly outwards. He grew the uEthalium
upon a horizontal surface of paper, across which a slow stream passed
from one side to the other, and he found that growth did not take
place more against the stream than with the stream.                  He argued
whether this was an example of negative geotropism or of growth
induced by the contrary stream of water, and he concluded that
JEihalium was negatively geotropic, but that the contrary flow of
water acted like the force of gravity and of centrifugalism.            To our
minds this does not seem an illogical conclusion, but Strasburger
maintained that it was an example of rheotropisrr. alone. Rheotrop-
ism, as far as fluid is concerned, cannot enter into our case. Our
tubes were always plugged with absorbent cotton wool, and were not
capped, and we never noticed moisture upon the surface of the gela
tine, and, in any case, the geotropic rami tend to very slightly or
deeply penetrate the gelatine.       We have stated that both in vertical
and centrifugalised gelatine growths, rami tend to pass deeply into-
the gelatine.     Now we have observed, when we have placed in the
               • ' Mem. Soc.

glass   dishes gelatine to the depth of 1 inch or more, that at the
lower portion of the streak of inoculation the rami which penetrated
the gelatine were very distinctly more horizontal than those higher
np.    This phenomenon is also very conspicuously marked in the case
of centrifugalised tubes. Further, our great difficulty in connexion
with centrifugalising gelatine is to keep it in position, for in a large
number of our experiments the gelatine is forced to the bottom of
the tube, and the cotton plug is often driven some distance into the
tube.     We can see, further, that the compression to which the
 gelatine is subjected increases towards the distal end of the tube.
 Towards the distal end, however, the rami tend to become more hori
 zontal, so it seems very much as if the tension of the gelatine caused
 the increased deviation to the horizontal.            Having gone so far, we
 may   ask  why  the  rami   are not  orthogeotropic.      We have many times
 called attention to the fact that the delicate filaments tend always to
 dip under the gelatine, and it may possibly be that it is the resist
 ance of the gelatine which causes the deviation from the vertical to
 the curions angle of about 45°.         We may here mention that this fact
 of the tendency to penetrate the gelatine is in apparent contradiction
 to the fact, that, as our experiments showed, COj hinders and O
 favours symmetrical growth. Now, as a matter of fact, very little
growth is obtained from a stab culture, so, therefore, it appears neces
 sary that some portion of the growth should be close to or freely in
 contact with the air, and this obtains in streak cultures.           To return to
 the action of the resistance of the gelatine, we have called attention
 to the fact that, next to the pinnate form of growth, the most striking
 feature in the life of Bacterium Zopfii is the tendency to curl. Kurth
attributes this fact to the resistance of the gelatine.                  Now the
 twisting and the geotropic position of the rami we find tend to go
 hand in hand ; they both tend to disappear upon agar or hard
 gelatine. Zopf noticed the absence of twisted forms in fluid. We
 find, as has been above stated, that the majority of the twists are in
 a direction contrary to the hands of a clock ; many of the photo
 graphs show this, and these were taken at a time before we had
directed our attention to the nature of the twist.                   Amongst the
higher plants    the  inward    twist is the commoner,      and   various theories
have been made to account for the twisting.             If we examine the rami
 which penetrate the gelatine we note that if they tend to be curved
they tend to be convex on the lower surface, and that thus we tend to
 have two surfaces, a dorsal and a ventral, and can imagine with the
 botanist a difference in the tension of the protoplasm on these sides of
 the filament. According to De Vries, whose paper from the Wurtz-
 burg Institute we have not been able to obtain, geotropism is not an
 improbable factor in the production of coils (Sachs). Wortmann* also

regards coiling as the result of geotropism, and a second factor -which
he terms rotating mutation. In our case the coils may he related to
the resistance of the gelatine and the negative geotropism.                        Bat
spirillar forms are well known throughout the microphytes ; they are
present in Gladothrix and many more lowly-organised forms, and are
found abundantly in fluid. Do, therefore, the spiral forms which we
have described as forming in the gelatine correspond to the free
spiral forms of the above examples ? If they do, and we have not
sufficient evidence to say they correspond, then the forces concerned
in their formation in the one case would be equally applicable to the
other.

I. "On Hepatic   Glycogenesis."    By D. Noel Paton, M.D.,
     Superintendent of the  Research Laboratory of the Royal
     College of Physicians of Edinburgh. Communicated by
     Professor McKendrick, F.R.S. Received July 24, 1893.
                                (Abstract.)
  Glycogenesis is here used in its original sense as indicating the
whole process of sugar production in the liver.
  The origin of sugar in the liver has been so conclusively demonstrated
that it is not considered.
   The evidence in regard to the relationship of hepatic sugar to
hepatic glycogen is discnssed, and is considered as conclusively in
favour of Bernard's original view.
   On the source of glycogen, all subsequent work has but established
Bernard's conclusion : " L'acte vital, c'est la production dn glycogeno
an sein du tissu vivant."
   On the mode of conversion of glycogen to sugar, more recent work
has not tended to confirm Bernard's view, that " L'acte chimique c'est
la transformation du glycogene en sncre." The question of whether
this conversion is due to a zymin, as held by Bernard, or to the vital
action of the liver protoplasm, as suggested by recent writers,        as   is,
yet, undecided.
  The object of the present communication        is   to elucidate   this point,

314                                Dr. Noel Paton.                         [Nov. 10,
and the question considered is, how far the process of conversion of
glycogen to sugar is dependent or independent of the life of the liver
cells.
     To determine this, the rate of conversion of glycogen to glucose in
the excised liver, roughly minced, and kept at from 37° to 40° C. in
normal salt solution, was first investigated. The object of the experi
ments not being to keep the liver cells alive as long as possible, but to
differentiate between changes dnring the life of the cells and after
their death, normal salt solution was used in preference to defibrinated
blood.
     Instead of estimating the sugar, as in Seegen's and Dalton's experi
ments, the glycogen was directly determined.                 For the analyses, the
method of Brucke was found more suitable than that of Kiilz.                       The
sources     of  error of  the method   are considered    at  length.
     The following table gives a summary of the results of the experi
ments upon this subject, and shows that during the first half hour the
conversion of glycogen is very rapid, that it steadily diminishes
during the remainder of the first hour, and after this goes on very
slowly.

A. Influence of Destruction of        the Morphological Structure of     the Liver
                           Cells on Hepatic Amylolysis.
    The liver of a rabbit, freshly killed and bled, was divided into three.
One part, A, was pounded in a mortar with fine clean sand, and was
then kept in salt solution at 40° C. The second part, B, roughly
minced, was placed in a similar solution. The third part, C, was
nsed to determine the initial amount of glycogen. At the end of some
time A and B were boiled, and the glycogen extracted.               The follow
ing    two experiments show that destruction of the structure of the liver
cells very greatly inhibits the conversion of glycogen.

B. Structural      Changes in Liver Cells of Excised        Liver kept under    the
                           Conditions above described.
    The histological methods employed are described and the structure
of the normal liver cell is considered.         In the liver kept in salt solu
tion at 40° C. as above described the protoplasm network becomes
more apparent and then breaks up and tends to collect round the
nucleus.      The nucleus, somewhat later, loses its distinct outline
and its network and stains diffusely. Finally, it breaks up.
    These changes begin to manifest themselves usually within the first
hour, and are often not completed even at the end of twenty-four
 hours.
    The conversion of glycogen seems thus divisible into two periods.
     1. An early period of rapid conversion          occurring before obvious
          structural changes appear in the liver cells.
    2. A late period       of slow conversion after the changes above
          described have developed.
    The rapid and extensive conversion appears to be inhibited by
destroying the structure of the liver cells.
    Further to elucidate the nature of these changes, the influence of
various factors upon them was studied.
    I. Temperature. — The possibility of distinguishing between zymins
and living ferments by the influence of temperature of over 60° C. in
destroying the latter, but not the former, is discussed, and it is con
cluded that it has a distinct, though restricted, value. So far as they
go, the following experiments, showing that exposure for one hour to
a temperature of 60° C. inhibits, but does not completely stop,
hepatic amylolysis,* favour the view that the process is dependent
on a living ferment rather than on a zymin.

" the conversion of hepatic glycogen to sugar."

    II.   Fluoride of sodium, in 1 per cent, solution, according to Arthns
and Huber, checks the action of protoplasm, bnt does not interfere
with the activity of zymins. It is shown that it markedly retards
hepatic amylolysis.          It does not accelerate the structural changes in
the   liver cells.
   III.    Chloroform water, according to Salkowski, is a reagent which
stops    the  vital action of protoplasms, but does not interfere with the
action of zymins.
   He gives an experiment upon its influence on hepatic amylolysis,
from which he concludes that he has established the accuracy of
Bernard's view, that the conversion is due to a zymin. In a series of
experiments        I  have obtained results opposed to that of Salkowski.
Three portions of the liver were taken.                One (A) was used for the
determination of the initial glycogen.               The other two parts were
placed in separate vessels in normal saline at. from 37° to 40° C.
Through one of these (B) a stream of chloroform vapour was con
ducted, a stream of air being directed through the other (C).                    The
following results were obtained :        —

   Experiments were also made which show that the glycogen                         is
actually converted to glucose.
   Chloroform markedly iucreases hepatic amylolysis.
   To determine whether the early rapid or the latter slow conversion
is thus accelerated, the following experiment was performed. In it
the large letters indicate the presence of chloroform, the small letters
its absence : —

    It  is the early rapid amylolysis which is accelerated.
    The influence of chloroform upon the structural changes in the
 liver cells was investigated, and it was found that the disintegrative
changes are markedly accelerated, occurring within the first half hour.
This may indicate that the rapid early conversion is due to the more
rapid katabolic changes in the protoplasm preceding its death.
    The occurrence of glycosuria and glycosuria after the administra
tion of chloroform rendered it desirable to ascertain if this accelerated
amylolysis occurs in the living animal under the action of the drug.
For this purpose, rabbits of one litter were kept on the same diet and
daily -weighed, in order to approximate the amount of glycogen in
their livers. For each experiment a pair of as nearly equal weight as
possible were selected. One was lightly anaesthetised for three or
four hours, the other was not. The fallacies in this method of ex
periment are fully considered.

   less marked.
      V. Pyrogallic acid, in 0'25 per cent, neutral solution, acts in the
   same manner upon the process of amylolysis and upon the liver cells.
      VI. Morphin (0005 to 0'025 per cent.), curare, nitrate ofamyl (vapour
   through salt solution), and salicylate of soda (0-5 per cent.), neither
   increase hepatic amylolysis nor do they accelerate the cellular
   changes.     The glycosuria caused by the administration of the first
   three of these is not due to increased hepatic amylolysis.
      The products of hepatic amylolysis in the early and in the later
   stage were also investigated.       In the early stage, glucose appears to
   be formed directly, and no intermediate bodies, such as dextrins or
   maltose, occur.     In the later amylolysis, the former of these, possibly
   the latter, are always found.
      In the light of these observations, the nature of the hepatic amylo
    lysis is considered, and it is maintained that the evidence shows that
   the early rapid amylolysis is different from the later slow process,
   and that it is simply the result of the katabolic changes in the proto
   plasm accentuated as death occurs ; that it is, in fact, siniply an
   exaggeration of the process of amylolysis during life ; and that it is
   in no way due to the action of a zymin, but is comparable to the pro
   duction of mucin from mucinogen, and zymin from zymogen.
      The later slow amylolysis is next considered.      The development of
   an acid reaction, partly, at least, due to lactic acid, is shown ; but
   experiments are given indicating that the acidity is not the cause of
   the amylolysis. The influence of micro-organisms is also investi
   gated, and experiments are given to show that the process goes on as
   rapidly when these are excluded as when they are present.              The
   evidence of the existence of a zymin in the dead liver is considered,
   and the conclusion is drawn that the later slow amylolysis is due to
   the action of such a zymin, probably developed during the disinte
   gration of the liver cells.

          lege, Cambridge,       Professor   of Zoology in University
          College, London.      Received August      9, 1893.
       In previous communications     I have discussed the variations in size
   occurring    in one   or two   organs of the common shrimp (Crangon
   vulgaris). In these papers it has been shown (1) that the observed
"-

  deviations  from the average size of every organ measured are grouped
  symmetrically about the average, and occur with a frequency corre
  sponding closely to that indicated by the probability integral ; and
                  " degree of correlation " between a given pair of organs
  (2) that the
  is approximately the same in each of five local races of the species
  (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 47, p. 445, and vol. 51, p. 2). In what follows
  I  shall describe the results obtained by measuring certain parts of
  the shore crab (Carcinus moenas) in two samples, one from the Bay
  of Naples, and one from Plymouth Sound, each sample consisting
 of 1,000 adult females.
                    1. — The Variation of Individual Organs.
     The measurements       made were as follows     : —
     1. The total length of the carapace (&g.   1, AB), in   a straight line from
 the tip of the median inter-orbital tooth to the middle of the posterior
 margin.

    2. The total breadth of the carapace, in a straight line from tip to
tip of the posterior lateral teeth (fig. 1, EF).

320               Prof. W. F. R. Weld on.            On certain       [Nov. 16,
   3.  The frontal breadth, from tip to tip of the anterior lateral teeth
(fig. 1,  CD).
   4.  The right antero-lateral        margin, from the tip of the median
inter-orbital  tooth  to the   tip  of  the postero-lateral tooth (fig. 1, AF).
   5.  The right dentary margin, measured in a straight line from the
tip of   the antero-lateral to the tip of the postero-lateral tooth (fig 1,
DP).
   6.  The left antero-lateral    margin, measured in the same way        as the
right.
   7. The left dentary margin.
   8. The sternal breadth, measured         between    the articulations   of the
great chelffl.
   9. The meropodite     of the right chela, measured in a straight line
between the inner articulations.
   10. The carpopodite of the right chela, from the inner articulation,
in a straight line to the tip.
   11. The proximal portion of the same carpopodite, in a straight line
from the inner articulation to the tip of the inner spine, at tho base
of the dactylopodite.
   The dimensions 2 — 11 were expressed in terms of the total length
of the carapace taken as 1000 ; and, in order to reduce the effect of
possible errors of measurement, the values so obtained were grouped
together in fours, the groups being so selected that no two individuals
in any one of them differed by more than 0"004 of the carapace length.
   As an example of the way in which the values thus obtained were
distributed, the measurements of the right antero-lateral margin in
Naples and in Plymouth may be examined.                    The results of these
measurements      are  shown     in  Tables   I and   II.   The frequency with
which every observed magnitude of this portion of the carapace
occurred in the Naples specimens is given in the second column of
 Table I. The arithmetic mean of all these values is 752-22 thousandths
of the carapace length ; and the observations will be seen to cluster
with a fair degree of symmetry around this value, the symmetry of
distribution being, perhaps, more readily seen by the eye in the
diagram, fig. 2. The total number of individuals in the sample was
999, and of these 513 had the antero-posterior margin greater than
the average size, 486 having this portion of the carapace below the
average.     The arithmetic mean of all the deviations from the average,
or "mean error" of distribution, was found to be 8"71 units; and
the modulus is therefore 8"71 x 1"77 = 15'42 units.               A probability
curve, with modulus = 1542 units, has been drawn by a dotted line
in fig. 2 ; and the close agreement between this carve and the observed
curve of distribution, which is indicated by a thick line, is very
striking.    In order to make a more accurate comparison possible, the
number of individuals corresponding to each observed magnitude, on

 the hypothesis that this probability curve represents the real distri
 bution about the mean, has been calculated from the tables of the
 probability integral, and is given in the third column of Table I. In

between the second and third columns of the table is undeniable.

   The frequency with which individual deviations from the average
occur is compared with that indicated by a probability equation of
the appropriate modulus in Table II.
   These two examples will give a fair idea of the extent to which
the distribution of the observed magnitudes of each organ about the
mean of all of them corresponds to that indicated by the probability
equation.     A similar treatment of every other set of measures would
serve no useful purpose ; it will be sufficient to give, in the following
table, the mean value, and the probable error of distribution about
that value, of every organ measured.         The probable error is given
below, instead of the mean error, because it is the constant which has

   The only      case  in which an undoubtedly asymmetrical result was
obtained is that of the frontal breadth of the Naples specimens.
From an inspection of the curve of distribution of these magnitudes,

presence, in the sample measured, of two races of individuals,

Karl Pearson has been kind enough to test this supposition for me :
he finds that the observed distribution corresponds fairly well with
that resulting from the grouping of two series of individuals, one
with a mean frontal breadth of 630'62 thousandths, and a probable
error of 12'06 thousandths ; the other with a mean breadth of
654'66 thousandths, and a probable error of 8-41 thousandths.                 Of the
first race, Professor Pearson's calculation gives 414"5 individuals, of
the second, 585-5.         The degree of accuracy with which this hypo
thesis fits the observations may be gathered from fig. 3.
   Fig. 3. — Diagram to show the distribution    of all observed frontal breadths in
the Naples specimens.     The horizontal   scale  represents thousandths of the cara
pace length, the vertical scale numbers of individuals.    Each ordinate of the upper
dotted curve is the sum of the corresponding ordinates of the two component
curves.
   We may, therefore, assume that the female Carcinus mcenas is
slightly dimorphic in Naples with respect to its frontal breadth ; and
that the individuals belonging to the two types are distributed in the
proportion of nearly two to three.

       2. — The Correlation  of Pairs of Organs :  Oalton's Function.
   The method adopted to determine the degree of correlation between
two organs was that proposed by Mr. Galton (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,'
vol. 40, p. 63). The measures obtained were sorted into groups, such
that in each group the deviation X of an organ A from its average
was constant.      The mean deviation from its average of a second
organ B was determined in each of these groups.             Calling ym the
mean deviation of B, the ratio yM/X was found to bo approximately the
same for all values of X.        The same individuals were then sorted
into groups in each of which the deviation T of the organ B was
constant : and in each of these groups, xm, the mean deviation of A,
was determined.      As before, the ratio xm/Y was approximately con
stant.
   Mr. Galton has shown that if Qa, Qj      be the probable   errors of the
organs A and B respectively, then
                      WQ»       xMIQg  _      constant.
                      X/Qa      Y/Q4
   The constant here denoted by r is evidently a measure of the
degree to which abnormality in one organ is accompanied by ab
normality in a second.      It becomes +1 when a change in one organ
involves an equal change in the other, and 0 when the two organs
are quite independent.        The importance of this constant in all
attempts to deal with the problems of animal variation was first
pointed out by Mr. Galton in the paper already referred to : and          I
would suggest that the constant whose changes he has investigated,
and whose importance        he has indicated, may fitly be known as
" Galton's function."
   As an example of the mode of determining this function, the cor
relation between the right and left antero-lateral margins of the
Naples crabs may be examined, by means of the data given in the
following tables.
   In Table IV the measurements of the right antero-lateral
margin have been sorted into groups, each group containing
individuals which differ by not more than O004 of the carapace
length, the magnitudes included in each group being given in the
first column.     In each of these groups the mean size of the left
antero-lateral margin was determined, and the- value obtained is
given in the second column.          From these data, and from the re
ciprocal data of the next table, the mean value of Galton's function
 was found to be 0-76, and the extent to which this value fits the
individual cases may be estimated from the third and fourth columns
 of the table.     In the third column, the value of the left antero
 posterior margin corresponding to every value of the right margin

has been calculated      on the assumption         that r = 0-76 ; and in the
fourth column the difference between this value and that actually-
observed has been recorded.           It will be admitted that these differ
ences    are   in all cases small, being in every case less than four
thousandths of the carapace length, that is to say, less than one nnit
of the measures employed.
   The reciprocal result, obtained by sorting the individuals into
groups in which the left antero-lateral margin had a constant value,
and observing the mean associated value of the right margin, is
shown in Table V, which will be understood without further explana
tion. In this table also the differences between the observed and the
calculated values are small, being always less than 0'0U2 of the cara
pace length, or half a unit of measurement.
   A similar examination of the right and left antero-lateral margins
of the Plymouth specimens gave 078 as the mean value of Galton's
f unci ion : and, considering the roughness of the method employed,
and the small number of individuals examined, these two values may
be considered identical.
   The approach to identity between the corresponding values of this
function in Naples and Plymouth is generally close, and may be
gathered from Table VI.
   The numbers given in this table show a remarkable degree of
coincidence between tho values of r derived from an investigation of
the same pair of organs in the two races examined.                  There are, in
some cases, considerable differences between the value in Naples and

   With the exception of the last two values, the degree of          coincidence
between the calculated and observed values is close enough to be of
value as an indication of the manner in which the variations are
distributed : and even in the case of the last two values the difference
is only l-5 times the unit of measurement.
   It may, therefore, be asserted that the investigation               which    has
been described does not demonstrate a difference between the value of
Galton's function for a given pair of organs in Naples and the corre
sponding value in Plymouth.              The values obtained are not in all
cases shown to be identical, but the differences between them are
within the limits of error of the method employed ; and in the worst
case it has been shown that the errors arising from a neglect of the

  1893.]        On the Mathematical Theory        of Evolution.           329
  observed discrepancy between two corresponding values are not of a
 very serious kind. So that in any discussion of the variation of the
  twenty-three pairs of organs discussed in the present paper, or of the
 pairs of shrimp organs discussed in my previous communication, it
 may be assumed as at least an empirical working rule that Galton's
 function has the same value in all local races. The question whether
  this empirical rule is rigidly true will have to be determined by fuller
 investigation, based on larger samples : but the value of a merely em
 pirical expression for the relation between abnormality of one organ and
 that of another is very great.    It cannot be too strongly urged that the
 problem   of animal  evolution  is  essentially a statistical problem : that
 before we can properly estimate the changes at present going on in a
 race or species we must know accurately (a) the percentage of
 animals which exhibit a given amount of abnormality with regard to
 a particular character; (6) the degree of abnormality of other organs
 which accompanies a given abnormality of one ; (c) the difference
 between the death rate per cent, in animals of different degrees of
 abnormality with respect to any organ ; (d) the abnormality of off
 spring in terms of the abnormality of parents, and vice versa. These
 are all questions of arithmetic;        and when we know the numerical
 answers to these questions for a number of species we shall know
 the direction and the rate of change in these species at the present
 day — a knowledge which is the only legitimate basis for speculations
as to their past history and future fate.

       By Karl Pearson, M.A., Professor of Applied Mathematics,
       University College. Communicated by Professor Henrici,
       F.R.S.    Received October 18, 1893.
                                  (Abstract.)
    1.  If a series of measurements,        physical, biological, anthropo
logical,   or economical,    not   of  the   same object, but of a group
of objects of the same type or family, be made, and a curve be
constructed by plotting up the number of times the measurements
fall within a given small unit of range to the range, this curve may
be termed a frequency curve.       As a rule this frequency curve takes
the well known form of the curve of errors, and such a curve may be
termed a normal frequency curve.           The latter curve is symmetrical
about its     maximum      ordinate.    Occasionally, however, frequency
curves do not take the normal form, and are then generally, but not
necessarily, asymmetrical. Such abnormal curves arise particularly
in biological measurements ; they have been found by Professor

330                 Prof. Karl Pearson.       Contributions  to       [Nov. 16,
Weldon, for the measurements of a certain organ in crabs, by Mr.
Thompson, for prawns, by Mr. Bateson, for earwigs. They occur,
however, in physics, e.g., Dr. Venn's barometric and thermometric
frequency curves ; in anthropology, e.g., Signor Perozzo's curves for
Italian recruits, and Dr. C. Roberts' carves for the eyesight of
Marlborough College boys and in fever mortality statistics ; in
economics, Mr. Edgeworth's curves of prices, and curves             I  have had
drawn for rates of interest.
    Frequency curves may, however, be abnormal and yet symmetrical.
These are much more likely to deceive even the trained statistician ;
such curves might arise in target practice, and would be due, for
example, to firing with equal precision, but with a change of sighting
at mid-firing.
    2. Abnormal frequency curves fall into three distinct classes :
    a.  Asymmetrical curves best represented by a point-binomial, or
          by its limit a continuous curve.
    6. Asymmetrical curves which are the resultant of two or more
          normal curves, with different positions of axes, different areas,
          and different standard deviations — a term used in the memoir for
          what corresponds in frequency curves to the error of mean
          square.
   e.  Symmetrical abnormal curves, wbich are compounded of two or
          more normal curves having coincident axes but different areas
         and standard deviations, or of two normal curves with the
          same areas and standard deviations but different axes.
    3.  Let   a. be the area of any frequency curve,         let the vertical
through     its  centroid,  or the line through its centroid perpendicular to
the axis of measurement             be drawn, and let the second, third,
fourth, fifth, and sixth moments about this centroid-vertical, «,«-,
afii, ans, and «««, be ascertained.       This can be done by graphical or
arithmetical processes indicated in the memoir, tables being given
to assist the calculation in the latter case. Then we can treat the
three classes of abnormal curves in the following manner : —
   4. Class a. — Let the binomial corresponding to the curve be :
x(p + q)n, where <p = probability in favour of an isolated event, q =
                                                                " causes " in a
probability against, and n = number of contributory
single trial. For example : the simultaneous spinning of n teetotums
with black and white sides proportional respectively to p and q, and
a the total number of times the group of « is spun.             Then it is easy
to fit this point-binomial to a frequency curve of which the ceDtroid
vertical and /<], /i3, /tj, and pn are known. The solution for this case
is not discussed in the memoir, having been already dealt with by the
author.
    If it be desired to draw a continuous curve corresponding to the

1893.]                 the  Mathematical Theory           of Evolution.             331
asymmetrical curve, we can proceed as follows : Imagine n to be
large, but the ratio qjp either small or large ; then we can obtain
generalised form, of the normal curve of an asymmetrical character;
its equation referred to the centroid vertical is

 Putting fi3 = 0 for an asymmetrical curve, the equation takes an in

have the usual normal form                :

    This generalised            probability      curve fits with     a  high degree of
 accuracy a number of measurements and observations hitherto not
 reduced to theoretical treatment, e.g., barometric frequency curves.
    The importance of this first dissection of asymmetrical frequency
 curves lies in the fact that it measures the theoretical number n of
 contributory
                     " causes " and the odds p : q that an element of devia
 tion will be positive.           The whole theory is, however, of an elementary
 character, and, as biological frequency curves often tend to develop a
 double-humped character,f they do not invariably fall under this
 class, and it is not dealt with at length in the memoir.
    5. Class b. — The general                theory of the dissection of a given
 abnormal frequency curve into m components is not dealt with, partly
 on account of its exceedingly great analytical difficulties, partly
 because there is an a priori probability that we have a mixture of
 only two homogeneous groups, or from the standpoint of evolution
 that the species will break up at first into two, rather than three or
 more, families. At any rate, the dissection into two is likely to give
 us either the chief components or a measure of the chief asymmetry
 of the curve. Supposing the curve asymmetrical, it is shown that the
 solution of the problem is theoretically unique, but it is pointed out
 that in statistical practice our curve is based upon a limited number
 of measurements, and is therefore not an accurately true compound
 of two normal groups.                  A theoretical test is given to distinguish
 between the better of two or more solutions.                     The method adopted
 for the dissection is based on equality of the first five moments and
 of the areas of the abnormal curve and of its two components.                      This
 method is justified in the same manner as the determination of the

normal curve by fitting any series of observations by aid of the area and
the first two moments (i.e., the first moment gives the mean, and the
second the error of mean square) is justified.        The method leads to
what is termed the fundamental nonic, every root of which gives a
real or imaginary solution of the problem.            The best solution is
selected by the criterion that it gives the closest approach to the
given frequency curve in the value of the sixth moment.            From the
nonic is deduced a quadratic for the areas of the components corre
sponding to each solution. If both roots of this quadratic are real
and positive, we have either a mixture of two heterogeneous species,
or evolution is breaking the homogeneous material up into two
families of different magnitudes,        different means, and different
standard deviations from the mean. If one root of the quadratic be
real and positive, and the other real and negative, we have evolution
destroying a certain percentage round a certain mean out of an
initially homogeneous and normal group.
   Should one of the standard deviations be imaginary, we get the
percentage of anomalous and irregular measurements in a homogeneous
group.
   6. Class c. — The solution here is unique and depends upon the
equality of the areas and of the first six moments ; for all odd
moments vanish, and we have four quantities to determine, i.e., the
percentages of each group and their standard deviations.          The solu
tion depends on a quadratic for the areas, and the same remarks apply
as to the quadratic for Class b.
   7. Rules are given for detecting whether we have a mixture of two
groups, or whether a differentiation into species of a homogeneous
material is going on ; aud also rales for measuring the amount of
asymmetry which is to be considered significant. The former rules
are, briefly : —
    i. Select the most asymmetrical curve out of the curves for the
        organs measured ; dissect it into two curves or groups by the
        method for Class b.
   ii. Select the most symmetrical curve out of the curves for the
        organs measured and dissect it into two groups by the method
        for Class c, or, if it have significant asymmetry by the method
        for Class b again.     Then («), if the first dissection is possible
        and the second is not, a real evolution is going on ; (/3), if the
        first dissection is possible and the second is possible, and both
        groups give sensibly the same percentages, we have a mixture
        of two heterogeneous materials and no true evolution, unless
        the organs be so closely allied that one must vary directly with
        the other (e.g., length of right and left legs) ; (7), both dis
        sections are possible, but give groups with different percent
        ages; we have both organs evolving differently at the same time.

    8. The theory is applied to Professor Weldon's measurements on
Naples crabs. It is shown that his material is absolutely homo
geneous, all roots of the nonic for No. 4 organ leading to imaginary
solutions, even its real root. On the other hand, it is shown that
the Naples crabs ai-e breaking up into two different sized families,
owing to evolution in their foreheads.            The theory is further
applied to Mr. Thompson's measurements of the carapace of prawns
(1,000 measurements).        It is shown that we have in the measure
ments a very small percentage of anomalous results, corresponding to
prawns deformed in this organ, or that there is, on the other hand,
a small hut unstable giant population mixed with the normal popula
tion.     Which of these results is to be considered the true answer to
the problem can only be determined after an analysis of the frequency
curves for other organs.
    From the mathematical standpoint, the memoir illustrates the de
termination of the roots of equations of the ninth degree, and the
calculation of the higher moments of curves.
IV. "Experiments in Heliotropism."            By G. J.  ROMANES,   F.R.S.
                       Received October 2, 1893.
    I cannot find in the literature of heliotropism that any experiments
have hitherto been made on the effects of interrupted illumination,
when the periods of illumination are rendered as brief as possible —
¦i.e., instantaneous flashes of   light. Accordingly    I have conducted
an extensive research on heliotropism, where the flashes have been
caused either by means of electric sparks in a dark room, or by the
opening of a photographic shutter placed before the plants in a camera
obscura with an arc light or Swau burner, at a distance of several
feet on the other side of the shutter.     The electric sparks were made
either with a "Wimshurst machine, induction sparks, or by means of
the following contrivance.     From the binding screws of the condenser
of a large induction coil copper wires were led to a cup of mercury,
where, by means of an electro-magnet suitahly actuated by clock
work, a current was closed and opened at any desired intervals: each
break was therefore accompanied by a brilliant spark.        A thick plate
of glass was interposed between the seedlings and the electrical
apparatus. In all the experiments here described the plants em
ployed were mustard seedlings (Sinapis nigra), previously grown in
the dark until they had reached a height of between 1 and 2 inches.
Save when the contrary is stated, in all the experiments comparative
estimates were formed Jby using the same pot of seedlings: during
the first half of a comparative experiment half of the seedlings were
protected from the light by a cap of cardboard covering half the pot ;
                                                              2 A 2

334                      Mr. G.   J.   Romanes.                [Nov. 10,
during the second half of the experiment this cap was removed, and
the pot turned round, so as to expose the previously protected
seedlings to the influence of the light.     The principal results thus
obtained, and frequently corroborated, were as follows.
    I. Even having regard to the fact that for equal strengths of a
stimulus excitable tissues are more responsive in proportion to the
suddenness of the stimulus (or in a kind of inverse proportion to the
duration of the stimulus), the heliotropic effects of such flashing
stimulation as is above described proved to be much greater than
might have been antecedently expected.        This was shown to be the
case whether the effects were estimated by the rapidity with which
the seedlings began to bend after the flashing stimulation was began,
or by that with which they continued to bend until attaining a hori
zontal line of growth, i.e., bending to a right angle.        Thus, at a
temperature of 70°    Fahr., and in a moist camera, vigorously growing
seedlings begin to bend towards the electric sparks ten minutes after
the latter begin to pass, and will bend through 45° in as many
 minutes ; frequently they bend through another 45° in as many
minutes more. This is a more rapid rate of bending than can be
produced in the same pot of seedlings when the previously protected
 side is uncovered and exposed for similar durations of time, either to
constant sunlight, or to constant diffused daylight.     This is the case
even if the sparks (or flashes) succeed one another at intervals of
 only two seconds.
     II. It would thus appear that the heliotropic influence of electric
 sparks (or flashes) is greater than can be produced by any other
 source of illumination.     But, in order to test this point more con
          I
 clusively,   tried the experiment of exposing one half-pot of seedlings
 in one camera to the constant light of a Swan burner, and another
 half-pot of similar seedlings, in another camera, placed at the same
 distance from the same source of light, but provided with a flash
 shutter working at the rate of two seconds intervals. The amount of
 bending in similar times having been noted, the pots were then
 exchanged, and their previously protected halves exposed to the
 constant and the flashing light respectively. In both cases, the
 rapidity with which the bending commenced, and the extent to
 which it proceeded in a given time after commencement, were
 considerably greater in the seedlings exposed to the flashing than to
 the constant source stimulation.     The same is true   if, instead of a
  Swan burner, the source of light is the sun.
     III. Many experiments were tried, in order to ascertain the smallest
 nnmber of sparks in a given time which would produce any per
 ceptible bending.    Of course, the results of such experiments varied
 to some extent with the condition of the seedlings.        But in most
 cases,  with vigorous young mustard seedlings and careful observation,

1893.]                  Experiments in Germination.                          335
bending could be proved to occur within fifteen to thirty minutes, if
bright sparks were supplied at the rate of only one per minute.
The most extreme sensitiveness that I have observed in these experi
ments was that of perceptible bending after half-an-hour's exposure
to electrical sparks following one another at the rate of fifty in an
hour. This result would appear to indicate that in heliotropism
under flashing light there need be no summation or " staircase
        " ; but that each flash or
effect                                  spark may produce its own effect
independently of its predecessors or successors.
    IV. It is noteworthy that, while the heliotropic effects of flashing
light are thus so remarkable, they are unattended with the formation
of any particle of chlorophyll. In the many hundred pots, and there
fore many thousands of plants, which have passed under my observa
tion in this research     I  have never seen the slightest shade of green
tingeing the etiolated seedlings which had bent towards flashing
light. On one occasion I kept a stream of 100 sparks per second
illuminating some mustard seedlings continuously for forty-eight
hours ; and although this experiment             was made for the express
purpose of ascertaining whether any chlorophyll would be formed
under the most suitable conditions by means of flashing light, no
change of colour in any of the seedlings was produced.
    With the exception of those mentioned in the last paragraph, all
these results were obtained by using sparks from the coil condenser,
as above explained.      These sparks were very brilliant, and yielded the
maximal results, which alone are here recorded.

                         Received October 2, 1893.
    The primary object of these experiments was to ascertain whether
 the power of germination continues in dry seeds after the greatest
 possible precautions have been taken to prevent any ordinary pro
cesses of respiration for practically any length of time.
     The method adopted was to seal various kinds of seeds in vacuum
 tubes of high exhaustion, and after they had been exposed to the
 vacuum for a period of fifteen months to remove them from the
 tubes and sow them in flower-pots buried in moist soil.                 In other
 cases, after the seeds had been      in vacuo  for a  period  of  three  months,
 they   were  transferred   to -sundry other  tubes  respectively   charged  with
 atmospheres of sundry pure gases         or vapours (at    the  pressure  of the
 air at time of sealing) ; after a further period of twelve months
 these sundry tubes were broken, and their contents sown as in
 previous case. In all cases, excepting that of the clover, the seeds
 sown were weighed individually in chemical balances, and seeds of

similar weights taken from the same original packets were similarly
sown as controls.
   The table on p. 336 gives the results of one snch series of experi
ments, where the exhaustion of the tubes was kindly undertaken by
                                  I
Mr. Crookes, F.R.S., to whom must express my best thanks for the
assistance   he has given.     But it may be mentioned that other series
of experiments    yielded virtually the same results.
   With the exception of the beans, where only two were sown, ten
weighed seeds were sown out of each of the tubes, and also out of
each of the control packets which had been kept in ordinary air
from the first. These results amply prove that neither a vacuum
of one-millionth of an atmosphere, nor the atmospheres of any of
the gases and vapours named in the above list, exercised much, if
any, effect on the germinating power of any of these seeds.           I niay
add that the same remark applies to an atmosphere of carbon di
oxide, although in the particular series of experiments quoted this
gas was accidentally omitted.
   A subsidiary object of these experiments was to ascertain whether
any appreciable variations would be caused in plants grown from
seeds which, before germination, had been submittted to the condi
tions above explained.       Hundreds of plants of the kinds named in
the above table were grown from the seeds in the various tubes.
But in no one instance was there the smallest deviation in any
respect from the standard type grown from the corresponding con
trol packet.
   It will be observed that, in the case of the beet-root, a larger
number of plants were developed in many of the pots than the ten
seeds which had been sown in each.        This    I  found to be due to the
fact that beet-root seeds very frequently throw up two seedlings apiece.
Wot so frequently, but still very often, they yield three, and some
times even four.
   Further experiments are in progress.

                                 (Abstract.)
   This investigation is an extension of the author's earlier researches
on the spectrum     of iron, and supplements the important paper pub
lished by Thalen in 1884. Since the work was commenced, two
other papers on the spectrum of iron have been published, one by
Professors Kayser and Runge, of the Hanover Technical High School,
and the other by Mr. F. McClean.        In the former, the arc spectrum
of ordinary commercial iron was in question.            The wave-lengths
were determined by micrometric measures, a number of standard
lines being used to construct the interpolation curves. Mr. McClean 's
paper consists of a series of photographic comparisons of the spark
spectrum of iron and the solar spectrum.
   A knowledge of the true spectrum of iron is of the utmost import
ance, both for solar and stellar work.         Comparisons    in terms of
iron are very important, and such a comparison is a natural first step
in their study when we have a terrestrial iron spectrum about which
there is no doubt.
   Thalen's memoir is practically complete so far as the visible arc
spectrum of iron is concerned.      The photographic arc spectrum over
the same region has not, however, hitherto received such minute
attention. This subject has been taken up at Kensington by photo
graphically comparing the spectrum of iron with the solar spectrum
between Fraunhofer's lines K and C. For this purpose, a small por
tion of some iron of exceptional purity, prepared by electrolytic
deposition by Professor W. C. Roberts-Austen, was placed by him at
the author's disposal.    A part was arranged to form the poles of an
electric arc lamp, which was placed about 4 ft. from the slit of a
Steinheil spectroscope, having three prisms of 45°, and one of 60°
an image of the arc being formed on the slit plate by a suitable lens.
                                      "           "
The current employed was from a Victoria            Brush dynamo, driven
by an
        " Otto
                "
                  gas engine,   and  making about 850 revolutions per
minute.
   The region of the spectrum between K and C was photographed
on four plates.    For the region between K and F ordinary photo

360            Photographic Spectrum   of Electrolytic Iron.   [Nov. 23,
graphic plates were used, but for the spectrum from      F to 0 specially
prepared plates were employed.
   The wave-lengths of the lines have been determined by reference to
Professor Rowland's second series of photographic prints of the solar
spectrum, and, consequently, are all expressed on Rowland's scale.
Tables of the wave-lengths and intensities of all the lines in the
photographs have been compiled, and a comparison instituted between
the Kensington results and those of Thal6n, Messrs. Kayser and
Runge, and McClean.       Though the iron used was the purest obtain
able, a few of the lines are probably due to impurities, and these have
been indicated in the tables.
   Many of the faint lines mapped by Messrs. Kayser and Runge are
evidently due to impurities in the iron used in their researches, and
the   origin of these lines has been traced, as far as possible, by
reference to the, as yet, unpublished Kensington maps of metallic arc
spectra, and the results are shown in the tables.
   The comparisons have led to the following conclusions : —
   1. The visual spectrum, as mapped by Thalen, differs but slightly
        in essential points from that which has been photographed at
         Kensington.    The principal difference is the greater number
        of lines mapped by Thalen in all regions except that between
        wave-lengths 4000 and 4300. This is probably to be accounted
        for by the insufficient exposure of the photographs, which was
        necessitated by the limited amount of material available for the
         experiments.
   2.  The comparison     with the spectrum photographed by Mr.
         McClean, indicates that the experimental conditions employed
         by him produced a temperature not greatly differing from
         that of the arc employed at Kensington.     There are only a few
         lines which are not common to the two series of photographs,
         and these, in many cases, can, with certainty, be ascribed to
        impurities present in one case and not in the other. The
         apparent differences in intensity between some of the lines
         which are common to both are mostly due to superposition of
         the spectrum of air upon that of iron in Mr. McClean 's photo
         graphs.   In some cases, however, there appears to be a real
         difference in the intensities of the lines, and this may prob
         ably oe ascribed to the difference between the temperatures
         employed.
   3.  The number of lines mapped by Messrs. Kayser and Runge is
         considerably in excess of that mapped by the author in corre
         sponding regions of the spectrum.     The comparison indicates
         that this is partly due to the fact that the iron employed in
         their experiments contained a greater number of impnritie-i
         than that employed at Kensington.        No origins have been

        traced   for many of the lines present in their photographs,
        which do not appear in the Kensington photographs, and some
        of these may. therefore, be really due to iron, their absence
        from the Kensington photographs being due to insufficient
        exposure, or to the employment of different temperatures. The
        almost constant difference of O'l tenth-metre between the two
         sets of measures is a satisfactory indication of the accuracy of
         both.
   4. The impurities which contribute the greater number of foreign
         lines to the spectrum of the electrolytic iron employed by the
         author are Ca and Mn, though there is decided evidence of
         the presence in minute quantities of various other elements.
   This research on the arc spectrum of iron is made in connection
¦with  a wider investigation on the arc spectra of the other metallic
elements, the results of which will be communicated to the Society in
due course.

    On the occasion of the recent Eclipse Expedition to Senegambia
we took with us a set of magnetic instruments of the Kew pattern,
with a view of making observations in a district for which the mag
netic elements have not hitherto been determined.         The instruments
employed were magnetometer No. 61, by Elliott         Brothers,  dip circle
No. 94, by Dover, and chronometer Dent 1932. They were part of the
equipment made use of in connexion with the Magnetic Survey of
the British Isles.
    Observations were made at Fundium, Senegal, and at Bathurst, on
 the  River Gambia.
    The results are as follows : —
      Fundium, Senegal, lat.  14° 7'-4 N., long. 16° 32' W. (approx.).
    The observations were made in the vicinity of the Eclipse Camp,
 and on a partially enclosed piece of ground between the Admini
 strator's house and the River Salum, about 80 yards from the shore.
 The temperature during the force observations was about 30° C.

    Frequently the redundant and condensed generating functions are
differently interpretable ; we then obtain an arithmetical correspond
ence, two cases of which presented themselves in the

the Compositions of Numbers."
   A more important method of obtaining arithmetical correspon
dences is developed in the researches which follow the statement and
proof of the theorem.
    The general form of V„ is snch that the equation
                                       V„ =   0
gives each quantity xs as a homographic function of the remaining
n — 1 quantities, and it is interesting to enquire whether, assuming
the coefficients of V, arbitrarily, it is possible to pass to a correspond
ing redundant generating function.
    I find that the coefficients of V„ must satisfy
                                   2" — /<*+»— 2
 conditions, and, assuming the satisfaction of these conditions,                 a re
 dundant form can be constructed which involves
                                         n— 1
 undetermined quantities.         In fact, when a redundant form exists             at
 all, it is necessarily of a (n — l)tuply infinite character.

   We are now able to pass from any particular redundant generating
function to an equivalent generating function which involves n— 1
undetermined quantities. Assuming these quantities at pleasure, we
obtain a number of different algebraic products, each of which may
have its own meaning in arithmetic, and thus the number of arith
metical correspondences obtainable is subject to no finite limit.
    This portion of the theory is given at length in the paper, with
illustrative examples.
    Incidentally interesting results are obtained ia the fields of special
 and general determinant theory. The special determinant, which
 presents itself for examination,       provisionally termed " inversely
symmetric," is snch that the constituents symmetrically placed in
 respect to the principal axis have, each pair, a product unity, whilst
 the constituents on the principal axis itself are all of them equal to
 unity. The determinant possesses many elegant properties which are
 of importance to the principal investigation of- the paper.           The
 theorems concerning the general determinant are connected entirely
 with the co-axial minors.
    I  find that the general determinant of even order, greater than two,
 is expressible in precisely two ways as an irrational function of its
 co-axial minors, whilst no determinant of uneven order is so expres
 sible at all.
     Of order superior to 3, it is not possible to assume arbitrary values
 for the determinant itself and all of its co-axial minors.      In fact of
 order n the values assumed must satisfy
                                2"— n! + »— 2
 conditions, but, these conditions being satisfied, the determinant     can
 be constructed so as to involve »— 1 undetermined quantities.

for the cases of a shaft resting freely on a bearing at each end, and
for an overhanging shaft fixed in direction at one end.
   The theory has been further extended to the case of a shaft loaded
with pulleys by Professor Reynolds ; and the object of this investiga
tion is to apply that theory and so obtain formulae — and by experi
ment to verify them — giving the critical speed in terms of the
diameter of the shaft, weights of pulleys, &c, in particular cases
applicable to the different conditions under which a shaft works.
   In many cases, as might naturally be expected, the " period of
whirl " of the shaft is merely its natural period of vibration.            The
two periods are coincident in the case of an unloaded shaft (however
supported), and for a loaded shaft on which the pulleys are placed in
such positions that they rotate, when the shaft is whirling, in planes
perpendicular to the original alignment of the shaft.             With pulleys
placed in any other positions, when the shaft is whirling, there is a
righting moment tending to straighten the shaft which does not exist
when it merely vibrates under the dead weight of the pulleys.
Hence, in an unloaded shaft, the period of whirl coincides with the
natural period of vibration; but, generally, in a loaded shaft, the
period of whirl is less than the natural period of vibration to an
extent depending on the size and positions of the pulleys.
   If, therefore, the period of disturbance (that is, the period of one
revolution) be decreased, the shaft runs true until that period ap
proximates to the natural period of vibration of the shaft under the
given conditions.      If the shaft now receive any displacement, how
ever slight, a violent agitation is set up, which will bo most marked
when the period of disturbance and the whirling period coincide.
 As the period of disturbance is further decreased, the agitation be
comes less and, at a period of disturbance slightly less than the
 whirling period of the shaft, the shaft again runs true.
   As in the vibration of rods, so in the whirling of shafts, there are
a series of periods at which the shaft whirls.
   Investigation shows that the formula obtained by considering the
 combined effects of the shaft and only one pulley, or the combined
effects of two pulleys neglecting the effect of the shaft, are too com
plicated — even in the simplest cases — for actual use.              The only
alternative method is to consider the effects of the shaft and each of
the pulleys (whatever be their number, position, and size) separately,
and so obtain the whirling speed for each on the assumption that all
the others are neglected.        By means of an empirical formula, the
whirling speed taking shaft and pulleys into account may be calcu
lated from the separately calculated speeds of whirl.

 1893.J         On the  Whirling and Vibration of Shafts.                  367
    Unleaded Shaft. — In the case of an unloaded          shaft, the  whirling
 speed is given by an equation of the form
                               (ww'IgEiyi =      a                          (1),
 in which
          w = weight of shaft in lbs. per foot run,
          9 =  gravity,
          E =  Young's Modulus (in lbs. per sq. ft.),
          I=   geometrical moment of inertia of cross section of shaft
                 about a diameter,
          w = angular velocity of shaft when whirling,
          I = length in feet of one of the spans, and
          a = some numerical coefficient depending          on the manner in
                which the shaft is supported.
    By substituting the proper value for the coefficients in Equation (1),
 we obtain the equations
                   N =   6 d/P, for  a solid shaft                          (2),
and                   =by(dx, + d1'l)IP, for   a hollow shaft               (3).
    In  these equations
          N = number of revolutions shaft         makes,   per minute, when
                whirling,
          d = diameter of the solid shaft in inches,
     dlf di = the external and internal diameters of the hollow shaft,
                both in inches, and
          6 = some numerical coefficient depending on         a, and also upon
the constants in Equation (1).
    For wrought iron or mild steel,      6  = 3331 a1 and for brass, 2222 a2.
    It  should be noticed that each span of a continuous shaft sup.
ported on bearings placed at equal distances apart whirls indepen
dently of the rest.
    Loaded Shafts. — The cases for a loaded shaft — as also those for an
unloaded one — which have been considered in the investigation, em
brace all those which are likely to arise in practice.            With a con
tinuous shaft supported on three or more bearings and loaded with a
pulley on one of the spans, general equations have been obtained for
unequal spans, but the complete investigation has only been
extended to the case of equal spans — a relation between the spans
which almost invariably exists in actual shafting. The results of
the investigation show that however the shaft be supported, the
whirling speed due to a single pulley on a light shaft is given by an
equation of the form
                              m =   6 /(jEI/WcO                              (4),
                                                                   2 c 2

368                               Mr. Stanley Dunkerley.                           [Nov. 23,
in which   u>,   g,   E,   I have     the same meanings          as in Equation (1), and
        W = weight of pulley in lbs. ;
        c = distance of pulley from nearest bearing in feet ; and
        6 = some numerical coefficient depending not only upon the
                      manner in which the shaft is supported, but also upon
                      the position of the pulley on the span which carries it
                      and the size of the pulley.
  For any particular mode of support of the shaft the coefficient 0 is
some function of the ratios c/l and cjk, where I = length of span
which carries the pulley, and k = V g (A— B)/W, where A and B
are the moments of inertia of the pulley about the axis of the shaft
and a diameter  of the pulley through its centre of gravity respec
tively, both being expressed in gravitation units. Assuming, there
fore, certain values for cjl and cjk, tables have been drawn up giving
the corresponding values of 0.        For each value of cjl there are two
limiting  values of cjk, viz., infinity and zero — the corresponding values
of k being zero and infinity. When k = 0 the pulley may be con
sidered simply as a dead weight, so that the " inferior period of
whirl," as it has been termed, is the natural period of vibration of
the light shaft under the given conditions. The " superior period of
whirl," that is to say, the whirling period when k = 00*, is the inferior
period multiplied by some function of cjl, and assuming the shaft to
whirl at a speed corresponding to the superior or inferior limit, it
would do so in such a manner that the pulley still rotated in a plane
perpendicular to the original alignment of the shaft. These limiting
values of the speed, below and above which whirling is impossible,
have been calculated in each case.
   Investigation shows that in a continuous light shaft supported on
bearings placed at equal distances apart, the increase in the whirling
speed due to those spans which are not immediately adjacent to the
loaded one, on either side, cannot exceed by above 2 or 3 per cent,
the whirling speed when only the loaded span and the spans im
mediately adjacent to it are taken into account.        In other words, the
stiffening effects of only those spans immediately adjacent to the
loaded one, on either side, need be taken into account in calculating
the whirling speed for the shaft.
   By substituting the proper values for the constants in Equation (4)
we obtain the equations
             N = 0          d2l   yWc3, for   a solid    shaft                                 (5),
and               = 0       ^(df-dS)! %/Wc3,            for a hollow shaft                     (6),
where   W, d,     c?a, ck    have the same        values     as before,      and   <jS   is   some
nnmerical coefficient depending                on the value         of   0   and of the con
stants in Equation (4)            .

   The value of 0 for wrought-iron       or mild steel is    5389 9, and for
brass 37720.
   Having thus obtained formulae giving the whirling speed due to
each cause, on the assumption that all the others are neglected, it only
remains to find an empirical formula giving the resulting whirling
speed, when all the disturbing elements are taken into account, in
terms of the separately calculated whirling speeds due to the several
causes.    Since the whirling speed in every case varies inversely as the
square root of the weight of the pulley (see Equation 4), the formula
for calculating the resulting speed was taken to be of the form
                             XWSQV+X/)                                     (7)
for two disturbing elements whose whirling speeds taken separately
are Nlf N» ; or of
                   N,N2NS/ v/ (N2JN32 + N,» N,1 + N,2Na2)                  (8)
for three disturbing elements whose whirling speeds, taken separately,
are Nt, N,, N*.      The formula may be extended to any number of
disturbing elements.      It is not strictly accurate, for in addition to
the whirling speed varying inversely as the square root of the weight
of the pulley, it also varies as some function (&) of the distance of
the pulley from the nearest bearing and of the size of the pulley.
The experiments, however, justify to a remarkable degree the as
sumptions that have been made in calculating the resulting whirling
speed.
    In calculating the speed at which a continuous shaft of given
diameter, supported on bearings placed at equal distances apart, and
loaded with pulleys on any or all of the spans, will whirl, the method
to adopt is to, first, find the span which will have the biggest whirl
 (that is to say the span which carries the heaviest and most advan
tageously-placed pulleys as regards whirling), and then to consider
this span and the spans immediately adjacent on either side.              The
whirling speeds    for the  shaft  and  each  of  the pulleys  on  the  three
spans have then to be calculated according to the rules laid down in
each case.    The whirling speed for any pulleys on the two side spans
will, of conrse, be different according as that side span is an end or
an intermediate span in the line of shafting.            Having fonnd the
whirling speed due to each cause, the resulting whirling speed is
found from an equation of the same form as Equation (7) or (8) — the
exact equation depending on the number of disturbing elements.
The speed thus obtained will be slightly less than the actual whirl
ing speed.     A nearer approximation to the actual speed might be
obtained by considering only those pulleys which lie near the centres,
or between the centres of the side spans and the bearings of the
middle span, neglecting the effect of those pulleys which lie beyond

370        Prof. Charlotte A. Scott.       On Plane Cubics.      [Nov. 23,
the centres of the side spans.    In doing so, however, the experiments
show that there is a danger of the calculated speed exceeding the
actual, whilst by taking all the pulleys on the two side spans into
account   the calculated   speed  will be   slightly less  than the actual
speed.
   If the spans of a continuous shaft, supported on bearings placed at
equal distances apart, are all loaded in the same manner, each whirls
independently of the rest, and the problem reduces to that of a loaded
shaft supported on bearings at the ends.
   The experimental apparatus by which the calculated results have been,
for the most part, verified is shown in a figure.         The experimental
shaft was 2 ft. 8 in. long and 0"2488 in. diameter.        The motion was
transmitted from the headstock spindle to the experimental shaft by
a fine piece of steel wire (about 1^ in. long and 21 B.W.G. diam.),
so that the shaft was subjected to very little constraint at the end.
The experimental pulleys were models of actual pulleys — being de
signed for both weight and inertia.          The headstock spindle was
driven from a turbine, the constancy of the speed being shown by the
steadiness of a column of liquid forced by a centrifugal fan indicator
up a glass tube. In taking the number of revolutions corresponding
to any period of whirl an ordinary counter pushed into the end of the
headstock spindle was used.      In making any experiment three trials
were made (each of three minutes' duration) and the mean of the
results taken.    Over 150 experiments have been made with this ap
paratus, and the observed results invariably approximate very closely
to the calculated results.     Experiments have also been made with
actual cases of shafting, and it would appear that, following the
method of solution sketched above, the calculated speed is about
3 or 4 per cent, less than the actual speed.
   The experiments were carried out in the Whitworth Engineering
Laboratory, the Owens College, Manchester.

this point on one of the known harmonic polare, the remaining two
points in which the harmonic polar meets the cubic are found by a
quadratic construction, and triangular symmetry completes the de
termination of the cubic; the inflexional tangents to the Hessian
and the cusps on the Cayleyan are found by linear constructions ;
and the pairs of points in which these curves are met by the har
monic polar, by quadratic constructions. Any coincidence among the
points so found indicates some special cubic whose properties may
thus be investigated ; among these special cubics are the equian-
harmonic cubics, whose properties present themselves very simply by
means of the preliminary constructions.         These special cubics are the
critical ones when we follow out the variation in the Hessian and
Cayleyan, which, depending directly on the variation in the original
cubic, expresses itself by the change in the relative position of the
points determined as above. This variation is shown in a series of
diagrams exhibiting the cubic, its Hessian, and Cayleyan ; and, finally,
the results being compared with those derived from analysis, the
variation is represented graphically by means of a single diagram.

    Dnring the past session our standing committees have been as active
 as ever.    The Library Committee have again had before them the
 question of finding accommodation to meet the rapid growth of our
 Library. One measure which, with the consent cf the Council, they
have adopted to this end has been to part with a number of the
literary and philosophical series of transactions published by those
societies which are not, like our own, purely scientific.     In some cases
these series are being returned to the institutions who gave them ; in
others, where this is not desired, they are presented to libraries in
which they will be of greater use than in our own.

pointed a Special Committee to arrange for the better accommodation
of the Fellows at their ordinary meetings and of their visitors at the
Annual Soirees. Upon the first floor a new doorway has been pro
vided, which, it is hoped, will help to a freer circulation on the
crowded nights of our Soirees, and on the ground floor, besides the re
arrangement of the meeting-room and the provision of a lecture table,
and additional accommodation for diagrams, a preparation room is
being fitted with suitable appliances for the use of those who are
willing to illustrate their papers by experiment.
   The generous gift of £2000 presented by our Fellow Mr. Ludwig
Mond, in the early part of the session, to aid the work of the ' Cata
logue of Scientific Papers,' has enabled the Catalogue Committee not
only to carry on the current work of the Catalogue, which want of
funds threatened to cripple, but also to take into consideration wider
schemes than it was possible to contemplate before.       The Committee
have met several times during the past session, and it is hoped that
the long-desired Subject Index may yet become an accomplished fact.
   The Water Research Committee have continued their labours, and
a Second Report on the vitality of microscopic pathogenic organisms
in large bodies of water, dealing with the vitality and virulence of
Bacillus anthracis and its spores, the result of Messrs. Percy Frank-
land and Marshall Ward's researches, has been completed during the
                                     '
past session and published in our Proceedings.'
   Except that additional assistants have been employed in the Cata
logue Department, our staff remains unchanged.
   During the past year, in the Mathematical and Physical Section of
the ' Philosophical Transactions,' 21 papers have been published, and
in the Biological Section, 10; the two sections together containing
a iobal of 1775 pages of letter-press, and 70 plates.    Of the ' Proceed
ings,' 12 numbers have been issued, containing 1282 pages and
19 plates.
   Not the least important of the scientific events of the year is the
publication, in the original German and in an English translation by
Professor D. E. Jones, of a collection of Hertz's papers describing
the researches by which he was led np to the experimental demonstra
tion of magnetic waves.       For this work the Ruraford Medal of the
Royal Society was delivered to Professor Hertz three years ago by
my predecessor, Sir George Stokes.      To fully appreciate the book now
given to the world, we must carry our minds back to the early days
of the Royal Society, when Newton's ideas regarding the forces
which he saw to be implied in Kepler's laws of the motions of the
Planets and of the Moon were frequent subjects of discussion at its
regular meetings and at perhaps even more important non-official
conferences among its fellows.

went to Cambridge to consult Mr. Newton on the subject of the pro
duction of the elliptic motion of the Planets by a central force,* and
on the 10th of December of that year he announced to the Royal
                                                                                       "
Society that he " had seen Mr. Newton's book, ' De Motu Corporum.'
Some time later, Halley was requested to " remind Mr. Newton of
his promise to enter an account of his discoveries in the register of
the Society," with the result that the great work ' Philosopbia)
Naturalis Principia Mathematica ' was dedicated to the Royal Society,
was actually presented in manuscript, and was communicated at an
ordinary meeting of the Society on the 28th of April 1686 by Dr.
Vincent.       In acknowledgment, it was ordered " that a letter of
thanks be written to Mr. Newton, and that the printing of his book
be referred to the consideration of the Council ; and that in the
meantime the book be put into the hands of Mr. Halley, to make a
report thereof to the Council."             On the 19th of May following, the
                            "                  '
Society resolved that Mr. Newton's Philosophic Naturalis Principia
                  '
Mathematica be printed forthwith in quarto, in a fair letter ; and
that a letter be written to him to signify the Society's resolution, and
to desire his opinion as to the volume, cuts, &c." An exceedingly
interesting letter was accordingly written to Newton by Halley,
dated London, May 22, 1686, which we find printed in full in Weld's
'History of the Royal Society' (vol. 1, pp. 308—309). But the
Council knew more than the Royal Society at large of its power to do
what it wished to do. Biology was much to the front then, as now,
and the publication of Willughby's book, ' De Historia Piscium,' had
exhausted the Society's finances to such an extent that the salaries
even of its officers were in arrears.               Accordingly, at the Council
meeting of the 2nd of June, it was ordered that " Mr. Newton's book
be printed, and that Mr. Halley undertake the business of looking
after it, -and printing it at his own charge, which he engaged
to do."
   It seems that at that time the office of Treasurer must have been
in abeyance ; but with such a Senior Secretary as Dr. Halley there
was no need for a Treasurer.

   t It is recorded in the Minutes of Council that the arrears of salary due to
Hooke and Halley were resolved to be paid by copies of Willughby's work.
Halley appears to hare assented to this unusual proposition, but Hooke wisely
" desired six months' time to consider of the acceptance of such payment."
  The publication of the ' Historia Piscium,' in an edition of 600 copies, cost the
Society £400. It is worthy of remark, as illustrative of the small sale which scientific
books met with in England at this period, that, a considerable time after the publi
cation of Willughby's work, Halley was ordered by the Council to endeavour to
effect a sale of several copies with a bookseller at Amsterdam, as appears in a letter

at his own expense, and entered instantly on the duty of editing1
it with admirable zeal and energy, involving, as it did, expostu
lations, arguments, and entreaties to Newton not to cut out
large parts of the work which he wished to suppress* as being
too slight and popular, and as being possibly liable to provoke
questions of priority.            It was well said by Bigaud, in his ' Essay
on the first publication of the Principia,' that " under the cir
cumstances, it is hardly possible to form a sufficient estimate of
the immense obligation which the world owes in this respect to
Halley, without whose great zeal, able management, unwearied
perseverance, scientific           attainments, and disinterested generosity,
the Principia might never have been published. "t Those who

cares, and labour involved in bringing through the press a book

success in getting the ' Principia ' published within about a year
after the task was committed to him by the Royal Society, two
hundred years ago.
    When Newton's theory of universal gravitation was thus made
known to the world Descartes' Vortices, an invention supposed to be
a considerable improvement on the older invention of crystal cycles
and epi-cycles from which it was evolved, was generally accepted,
and seems to have been regarded as quite satisfactory by nearly all
the philosophers of the day.
    The idea that the Sun pulls Jupiter, and Jupiter pulls back against
the Sun with equal force, and that the Sun, Earth, Moon, and Planets
all act on one another with mutual attractions, seemed to violate the
supposed philosophic principle that matter cannot act where it is
not.      Descartes's doctrine died hard among the mathematicians and
philosophers of Continental Europe ; and for the first quarter of last-
century belief in universal gravitation was an insularity of our
countrymen.

   Voltaire,    during a visit which he made to England in 1727,
wrote   :
          " A Frenchman who arrives in London finds a great alteration
in philosophy, as in other things. He left the world full ; he finds
it empty.      At Paris you see the universe composed of vortices of
subtle matter; at London we see nothing of the kind.                        With you
it is the pressure of the Moon which causes the tides of the sea ; in
England it is the sea which gravitates towards the Moon. . . . You
will observe also that the Sun, which in France has nothing to do
with the business, here comes in for a quarter of it. Among you
Cartesians all js done by impulsion : with the Newtonians it is done
by an attraction of which we know the cause no better."* Indeed,
the Newtonian opinions had scarcely any disciples in France till
Voltaire asserted their claims on his return from England in 1728.
Till then, as he himself says, there were not twenty Newtonians out
of England. t
   In the second quarter of the century sentiment and opinion in
France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy experienced a great change.
The mathematical prize questions proposed by the French Academy
naturally brought the two sets of opinions into conflict.                 A Cartesian
memoir of John Bernoulli was the one which gained the prize in
1730. It not infrequently happened that the Academy, as if desirous
to show its impartiality, divided the prize between Cartesians and
Newtonians. Thus, in 1734, the question being the cause of the in
clination of the orbits of the planets, the prize was shared between
John Bernoulli, whose memoir was founded on the system of vortices,
and his son Daniel, who was a Newtonian.                  The last act of homage
of this kind to the Cartesian system was performed in 1740, when the
prize on the question of the tides was distributed between Daniel
Bernoulli, Euler, Maclaurin, and Cavallieri ; the last of whom had
tried to amend and patch up the Cartesian hypothesis on this
subject.^
    On the 4th of February, 1744, Daniel Bernoulli wrote as follows to
Euler : " Uebrigens glaube ich, dass der Aether sowohl gravis versus
solem, als die Luft versus terram sey, und kann Ihnen night bergen,
dass ich iiber diese Puncte ein volliger Newtonianer bin, vnd verwun-
dere ich mich, dass sie den          Principiis Cartesianis so lang adhariren ;
es mochte wohl einige          Passion   vielleicht mit unterlaufen. Hat Gott
konnen eine animam, deren Natnruns nnbegreiflich ist, erschaffen, so
hat er auch konnen eine attractionem nniversalem materiae im-
 primiren, wenn gleich solche attractio supra captum ist, da hingegen
die Principia Cartesiana allzeit contra captum etwas involviren."

 to the Cartesian principles, declares himself a thorough-going New
 tonian, not merely in respect to gravitation versus vortices, bat iu
 believing that matter may have been created simply with the law
 of universal attraction without the aid of any gravific medium or
 mechanism.        But in this he was more Newtonian than Newton him
self.
    Indeed Newton was not a Newtonian, according to Daniel Ber
 noulli's idea of Newtonianism, for in his letter to Bentley of date
 25th February, 1692,* he wrote : " That gravity should be innate,
inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body^may act upon
another at a distance through a vacuum without the mediation of
anything else, by and through which their action and force may be
conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity that I
believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty
of thinking can ever fall into it." Thus Newton, in giving out bis
great law, did not abandon the idea that matter cannot act where it
is not.     In respect, however, merely of philosophic thought, we must
feel that Daniel Bernoulli was right ; we can conceive the Sun at
tracting Jupiter, and Jupiter attracting the Sun, without any inter
mediate medium, if they are ordered to do so.                  But the question
remains — Are they so ordered ? Nevertheless,                 I   believe all, or
nearly all, his scientific contemporaries agreed with Daniel Bernoulli
in answering this question affirmatively. Very soon after the middle
of the eighteenth century Father Boscovichf gave his brilliant
doctrine (if infinitely improbable theory) that elastic rigidity of
solids, the elasticity of compressible liquids and gases, the attractions
of chemical affinity and cohesion, the forces of electricity and magnet
 ism — in short, all the properties of matter except heat, which he attri
buted to a sulphureous fermenting essence — are to be explained by
 mutual attractions and repulsions, varying solely with distances,
 between mathematical points endowed also, each of them, with inertia.
 Before the end of the eighteenth century the idea of action-at-a-dis-
 tance through absolute vacuum had become so firmly established, and
 Boscovich's theory so unqualifiedly accepted as a reality, that the idea
 of gravitational force or electric force or magnetic force being pro
 pagated through and by a medium seemed as wild to the naturalists
 and mathematicians of 100 years ago as action-at-a-distance had
 seemed to Newton and his contemporaries 100 years earlier.                 But a
 retrogression from the eighteenth century school of science set in
 early in the nineteenth century.

efficiency of air and of liquid and solid insulators, resuscitated the
idea of a medium through which, and not only through which but
by which, forces of attraction or repulsion, seemingly acting at a dis
tance, are transmitted.         The long struggle of the first half of the
eighteenth century was not merely on the question of a medium to
serve for gravific mechanism, but on the correctness of the Newtonian
law of gravitation as a matter of fact however explained.                      The
corresponding controversy in the nineteenth century was very short,
and it soon became obvious that Faraday's idea of the transmission
of electric force by a medium not only did not violate Coulomb's law
of relation between force and distance, but that, if real, it must give
a thorough explanation of that law.*             Nevertheless, after Faraday's
discoveryf of the different specific          inductive  capacities of different
insulators, twenty years passed before it was generally accepted in
Continental Europe. But before his death, in 1867, he had succeeded
in inspiring the rising generation of the scientific world with some
thing approaching to faith that electric force is transmitted by a
medium called ether, of which, as had been believed by the whole
scientific world for 40 years, light and radiant heat are transverse
vibrations. Faraday himself did not rest with this theory for elec
tricity alone. The very last time           I  saw him at work in the Royal
Institution was in an underground cellar, which he had chosen for
freedom from disturbance ; and he was arranging experiments to test
the time of propagation of magnetic force from an electro-magnet
through a distance of many yards of air to a fine steel needle polished to
reflect light ; but no result came from those experiments.              About the
same time or soon after, certainly not long before the end of his
working time, he was engaged (I believe at the shot tower near
Waterloo Bridge on the Surrey side) in efforts to discover relations
between gravity and magnetism, which also led to no result.
   Absolutely nothing has hitherto been done for gravity either by
experiment or observation towards deciding between Newton and
Bernoulli, as to the question of its propagation through a medium, and
up to the present time we have no light, even so much as to point a
way for investigation, in that direction. But for electricity and mag
netism, Faraday's anticipations and Clerk-Maxwell's splendidly de
veloped theory have been established on the sure basis of experiment
by Hertz's work, of which his own most interesting account is this
year presented to the world in the German and English volumes to
which     I have referred. It is interesting to know, as Hertz explains
in his introduction, and it is very important in respect to the experi-

mental demonstration of magnetic waves to which he was led that
he began his electric researches in a problem happily put before him
thirteen years ago by Professor von Helmholtz, of which the object
was to find by experiment some relation between electromagnetic
forces and dielectric polarisation \>i insulators, without, in the first
place, any idea of discovering           a progressive propagation of those
forces through space.
    It  was by sheer perseverance in philosophical experimenting that
Hertz was led to discover a finite velocity of propagation of electro
magnetic action, and then to pass on to electromagnetic waves in air
and their reflection, and to be able to say, as he says in a short review
ing sentence at the end of his eighth paper : " Certainly it is a fasci
nating idea that the processes in air which we have been investigating,
represent to us on a million-fold larger scale the same processes
which go on in the neighbourhood of a Fresnel mirror, or between
 the glass plates used for exhibiting Newton's rings."
     Professor Oliver Lodge has done well, in connection with Hertz's
 work, to call attention* to old experiments, and ideas taken from
 them, by Joseph Henry, which came more nearly to an experimental
 demonstration of electromagnetic waves than anything that had been
 done previously.       Indeed Henry, after describing experiments show
ing powerful enough induction due to a single spark from the prime
conductor of an electric machine to magnetise steel needles at a dis
 tance of 30 ft. in a cellar beneath with two floors and ceilings inter
                                " disposed to
  vening, says that he is                         adopt the hypothesis of an
 electrical plenum," and concludes with a short reviewing sentence :
 "It may be further inferred that the diffusion of motion in this
 case is almost comparable with that of a spark from a flint and steel
 in the case of light."
     Professor Oliver Lodge himself did admirable work in his investi
 gations with reference to lightning rods,t coming very near to experi
  mental demonstrations         of electromagnetic      waves ; and he drew
                                    "                      "

     Of electrical surgings or waves in a short insnlated wire, and of
  interference between ordinary and reflected waves, and positive elec

   In connexion with the practical development of magnetic waves,
you will, I am sure, be pleased if I call your attention to two papers
by Professor G. F. Fitzgerald, which I heard myself at the meeting of
the British Association at Southport, in 1883.       One of them is entitled
" On a Method of Producing Electromagnetic Disturbances of com
paratively Short Wave-lengths."        The paper itself is not long, and I
shall read it to you in full, from the ' Report of the British Asso
ciation,' 1883 : " This is by utilising the alternating currents pro
duced when an accumulator is discharged through a small resistance.
It is possible to produce waves of as little as 2 metres wave-length,
or even less."    This was a brilliant and useful suggestion.         Hertz,
not knowing of       it,
                      used the method and, making as little as possible
                                            ;
of the " accumulator," got waves of as little as 24 cm. wave-length in

   During the 56 years which have passed since Faraday first
offended physical mathematicians        with his curved lines of force,
many workers and many thinkers have helped to build up the nine
teenth century school of plenum       one ether for light, heat, electricity,

realised.
   But, splendid as this consummation           is,
                                        we must not fold our hands
and  think or say there are no more worlds to conquer for electrical
science.  We do know something now of magnetic waves. We know
that they exist in nature and that they are in perfect accord with
Maxwell's beautiful theory. But this theory teaches us nothing of
the actual motions of matter constituting a magnetic wave.      Some
definite  motion of matter perpendicular to the lines of alternating
magnetic force in the waves and to the direction of propagation of
the action through space, there must be   and     ;seems almost satis

of propagation, that is to say, precisely the vibrations in the undula-
tory theory of light according to Fresnel.                     Bnt we have as yet
absolutely no guidance towards any understanding or imagining of
the relation between this simple and definite alternating motion, or
any other motion or displacement of the ether, and the earliest known
phenomena of electricity and magnetism — the electrification of matter,
and the attractions and repulsions of electrified bodies ; the per
manent magnetism of lodestone and steel, and the attractions and
repulsions due to it : and certainly we are quite as far from the
clue to explaining, by ether or otherwise, the enormously greater
forces of attraction and repulsion now so welt known after the modern
discovery of electromagnetism.
   Fifty years ago it became strongly impressed on my mind that the
difference of quality between vitreous and resinous electricity, con
ventionally called positive and negative, essentially ignored as it is
in the mathematical theories of electricity and magnetism with
which    I    was then much occupied (and in the whole science of mag
netic waves as we have it now), must be studied if we are to learn
anything of the nature of electricity and its place among the pro
perties of matter.         This distinction, essential and fundamental as it
is in frictional electricity, electro-chemistry, thermo-electricity, pyro-
electricity of crystals, and piezo-electricity of crystals, had been long
observed in the old known beautiful appearances of electric glow and
brushes and sparks from points and corners on the conductors of
ordinary electric machines and in exhausted receivers of air-pumps
 with electricity passed through them. It was also known, probably as
many as fifty years ago, in the vast difference of behaviour of the
positive and negative electrodes of the electric arc lamp.                     Faraday
gave great attention to it* in experiments and observations regarding
electric sparks, glows, and brushes, and particularly in his " dark
               "
discharge and " dark space in the neighbourhood of the negative

electrode in partial vacuum. In [1523] of his 12th series, he says,
 " The results connected with the different conditions of

 negative     discharge   will  have    a  far greater  influence   on the  philosophy
of electrical science than we at present imagine." His " dark dis
          "            —
charge         ([1544 1554]) through space around or in front of the
 negative electrode was a first instalment of modern knowledge in
 that splendid field of experimental research which, fifteen years later,
and up to the present time, has been so fruitfully cultivated by many
 of the ablest scientific experimenters of all countries.

of the great modern improvements in practical methods for ex

containing less than 1/190,000 of the air which would be left in
them by all that conld be done in the way of exhausting (supposed
to be down to 1 mm. of mercury) by the best air-pump of fifty years

made by the authors of these communications ; and their references to
the discoveries of other workers very nearly complete the history of
all that has been done in the way of investigating the transmission of
electricity through highly rarefied air and gases since the time of
Faraday.
   Varley's short paper of 1871, which, strange to say, has lain almost
or quite unperceived in the Proceedings during the twenty-two years
since its publication, contains an important first instalment of dis
covery in a new field — the molecular torrent from the " negative
pole," the control of its course by a magnet, its pressure against either
end of a pivoted vane of mica according as it is directed by a magnet
to one end or the other, and the shadow produced by its interception
by a mica screen.    Quite independently of Varley, and not knowing
what he had done, Crookes was led to the same primary discovery,
not by accident, and not merely by experimental skill and acuteness
of observation.   He was led to it by carefully designed investigation,

  starting with an examination of the cause of irregularities which had
  trouhled* him ia his weighing of thallium ; and, going on to trials
  for improving Cavendish's gravitational measurement, in the course
  of which he discovered that the seeming attraction by heat is only
  found in air of greater than 1/lOOOf of ordinary density ; and that
  there is repulsion increasing to a maximum when the density is
  decreased from 1/1000 to 36/1,000,000,             and thence diminishing
  towards zero as the rarefaction is farther extended to density
  1/20,000,000.      From this discovery Crookes came to his radiometer,
  first without and then with electrification ; and, powerfully aided by
  Sir George Stokes,J he brought all his work more and more into
  touch with the kinetic theory of gases ; so much so that when
  he discovered the molecular torrent he immediately gave it its true
 explanation — molecules of residual air, or gas, or vapour pro
 jected at great velocities§ by electric repulsion from the negative
 electrode.      This explanation has been repeatedly and strenuously

to rapidly evaporate.       This last-mentioned result is almost more sur
prising than the phosphorescent glow excited by molecular impacts
in bodies not rendered perceptibly phosphorescent by light. Both
phenomena will surely be found very telling in respect to the mole
cular constitution of matter and the origination of thermal radiation,
¦whether visible as light or not.         In the whole train of Crookes'
investigations    on    the  radiometer,  the  viscosity of gases at high
exhaustions, and the electric phenomena of high vacuums, ether
seems to have nothing to do except the humble function of showing
to our eyes something of what the atoms and molecules are doing.
The same confession of ignorance must be made with reference to
the subject dealt with in the important researches of Schuster and
J. J. Thomson on the passage of electricity through gases. Even in
 Thomson's beautiful experiments showing currents produced by
circuital electromagnetic induction in complete poleless circuits, the
presence of molecules of residual gas or vapour seems to be the
essential.    It seems certainly true that without the molecules there
could be no current, and that without the molecules electricity has no
                                           I
 meaning. But in obedience to logic must withdraw one expression
 I  have used.    We must not imagine that " presence of molecules is
 the essential."    It is certainly an essential. Ether also is certainly
 an essential,  and  certainly has more to do than merely to telegraph to
 our eyes to tell us of what the molecules and atoms are about.          If a
 first step towards understanding the relations between ether and
 ponderable matter is to be made, it seems to me that the most hope
 ful foundation for it is knowledge derived from experiment on
 electricity in high vacuum ; and if, as I believe is true, there is good
 reason for hoping to see this step made, we owe a debt of gratitude
 to the able and persevering workers of the last forty years who have
 given us the knowledge we have : and we may hope for more and more
 from some of themselves and from others encouraged by the fruitful-
 ness of their labours to persevere in the work.

     In presenting    the Copley Medal to     Sir George Stokes I feel that
 no " statement of claim

                                 is needed.
 to recall to memory something of the great work that he has done in
 mathematical and physical science. Fifty-two years ago he took up
 the subject of fluid motion with mathematical power amply capable to
 advance on the lines of Lagrange, Fourier, Cauchy, Poisson, in the

390                        Anniversary   Meeting.                  [Nov. 30,
splendid nineteenth century "physical mathematics," invented and
founded hy those great men ; and with a wholly original genius for
discovery in properties of real matter, which enhanced the superlative
 beauty of the mathematical problems by fresh views deep into the
constitution of matter.
   In the purely mathematical part of his hydro-dynamical subject he
                                        "
advanced from the " infinitely small waves of Cauchy and Poisson
to deep-sea waves of such considerable steepnesses and lengths and
heights as are seen in nature — on water 500 fathoms deep, or more,
after a severe gale far away from land ; and he has shown how to
carry on his mode of solution right up to breaking waves at sea and
tidal bores in shallow water.
   His enunciations and solutions for motion of viscous fluids, rich
with applications to natural phenomena — the distance of audibility
of sound, the suspension of clouds in the air, the subsidence of
ripples on a pond and of waves on the ocean after the cessation of
wind ; and rich in aids to scientific investigation, as in the theory of
the pendulum in air— have added to hydro-dynamics a previously
unknown province, in which the exceeding difficulty of the mathe
matical work deserves every capable effort to advance        it,on account
of the vast practical and scientific importance of the issues.
   His " instability " of the motion of viscous fluid in the neighbour
                                         a
hood of a solid gives the key to the scientific mystery of turbulent
motion in practical hydraulics, and in wind blowing over solid earth       ;
the hearing of sounds in the direction of the wind which are inaudible
at equal distances in the contrary direction        ;the flow of water in
rivers, culverts, and water supply pipes     ;   the " skin-resistance " of
ships, the scientific consideration of which has done so much to make
22 knots a proper speed for travelling by sea.
   Of true dynamical science in all these subjects Stokes' early work
was the beginning.       It also first gave true views as to that very
important practical subject, the rigidity, and the resistance against
compression, of solids views which would be false
                       ;                                if    a majority of
votes in the scientific world of 1893 could decide between truth and
error.
   In optics and the undulatory theory of light, Stokes has been the
teacher and guide of his contemporaries.        His Report to the British
                        "
Association in 1862, On Double         Refraction,"   showed with perfect
accuracy   and clearness  the outstanding  difficulties, but called special
attention to the door which Green had opened for escape from them.
That Report has given the starting impulse and essential information
for nearly all that has been done for the subject in England since its
publication.

from which he drew an exceedingly rigorous verification of the accuracy
of Huyghens' geometrical construction for the double refraction of
Iceland spar, Sir George Stokes has done much to make the Un-
dulatory Theory of Light sure and strong as it is — a codification of
laws divined by Huyghens and Fresnel. But he has done more than
this.    He has not merely left to mathematicians and speculative
physicists a desperate problem to find the dynamical explanation of
those laws.      He has given (perhaps only in conversation) what
seems to me certainly the true clue to the dynamics of the Undula-
tory Theory of Light by pointing out that we must look not merely,
or not at all, to change of shape of the portion of ether within a
wave-length in the motion constituting light, but also, or altogether,
to its absolute rotation, for explaining the efficient force.

 tion. The results he has obtained will be found in joint papers in
 the 'Phil. Trans.,' 1884 and 1889. He was associated with Lord
 Rayleigh in one of his determinations of the ohm. In 1889 also he
 showed that the diurnal magnetic changes could be accounted for by
 a disturbing cause outside the earth's surface, and could not be
 accounted for by a disturbing cause within the earth's surface.
    But perhaps the researches of most general interest are those on
 electric discharge through gases. These will be found in the " Pro
 ceedings of the Royal Society," vols 42 and 47.            In the former
 paper   he   shows, amongst other things, that a steady current of
 electricity can be obtained in air from electrodes at the ordinary
 temperature, which are at a difference of potential of a quarter of a
 volt only, provided that an independent current is maintained in the
 same closed vessel. A vessel from which the air could be exhausted
 was nearly divided into two parts by a metallic partition connected
 to earth. A pair of electrodes was introduced on one side of the
 partition between which a current could be passed from a battery of
 many cells. A second pair was introduced into the vessel on the
 other side of the partition, and these were connected to the poles of a
 battery of low electromotive force. When high electric pressure was
 applied to produce a current between the first pair of electrodes, a
 current due to the battery of low electromotive force also passed
 between the second pair. Professor Schuster supposes that the effect

of the first current of high electromotive force is to break up some of
the molecules of gas, and that the wandering atoms can then yield to
small electrical forces to which the complete molecule is insensitive.
    Professor Schuster has worked in many branches        of physics, and
has advanced the knowledge of each.

                    Professor H. Marshall Ward, F.B.S.
     Professor H. Marshall Ward's claims to the recognition by the
 Royal Society implied in the award of a Royal Medal rest mainly
 on the series of brilliant investigations he has carried out, having for
 their object the elncidation of the phenomena of life exhibited by the
 Fungi and the Schizomycetes, and the effects of the life of these
 plants, whether exhibited in a hurtful form as disease, in living
 organisms, or in an useful form in the production of substances of
 economic importance.      These investigations, planned with ingenuity,
 and completed with resourceful industry, have resulted in most
 valuable contributions to natural knowledge.           In the additions
 they make to      the   sum   of our knowledge regarding the plant
 forms dealt with they are admirable and weighty, but, over and
 above the botanical interest attaching to the work, it has a far-
 reaching importance in the whole world of biology, touching as it
 does the fundamental point of the interaction of living organisms
  and the conditions under which symbiosis, whether beneficial or
 baneful, is developed and maintained ; and its conclusions are of vital
 value in their immediate bearing upon such large industries as
 agriculture, horticulture, forestry, and brewing, and in relation to the
 scientific basis of sanitary procedure.
     The series of purposeful and practical researches which place
  Professor Marshall Ward in the front rank of biologists was initiated
  by his investigation of the disease which devastated, a decade or so
  ago, the coffee plantations in Ceylon.    Undertaking this work at the
 invitation of the Ceylon Government, Professor Marshall Ward
  exposed, in a detailed account of the life history of Hemileia vastatrix,
  the fungus which immediately caused the disease, and whilst his
  work contributed many new morphological and physiological facts,
  its chief importance lay in the scientific basis it established, upon
  which any method of treatment that might be adopted should be
 founded.     Following up the line thus entered upon, Professor
  Marshall   Ward   took up the better known questions of the salmon
 disease, the damping off of seedling plants, and the potato disease,
  and, in an admirably recorded series of observations upon the Fungi
 connected with these diseases, brought to light many points of great
 importance, especially in the direction of showing the influences

exercised by the host in modifying the structure of the parasite, and
conversely the effect of the parasite upon the host, and the mechanism
of its attack.    Subsequent work on the disease of lilies is specially
valuable,   on acconnt of the recognition and separation of the ferment
by -which the passage of fungi through the tissues of their host is
effected.    Upon the recrudescence of the question of the relation
of plants to the free nitrogen of their environment, which we owe to
the experimental     and structural investigations in connexion with
leguminous crops, carried on in this country at Rothamsted, and in
 Germany by Frank and Hellriegel, we find Professor Marshall Ward
attacking the point from his practical standpoint, and to him we are
indebted for the discovery that the well-known nitrogen-storing root
tubercles of the Leguminos» are a consequence of the attack of a
fungus, the mycelium of which penetrates the root hairs, and gives
origin eventually to the active " bacteroids

fundamental fact in the relation of the plants to the soil.
   The best summary of the general bearing of his several investiga
tions up to date is probably that provided by himself in the Croonian
Lecture he delivered, in 1890, upon the relations between host and
parasite in plant diseases, one of the most suggestive of the many
interesting lectures that have been given under the foundation, and
it is not amiss to mention here also, as remarkable for its suggestive-
ness, his paper of earlier date on
                                    "
                                      Sexuality in Fungi," in which the
progressive apogamy     of  the group   is dealt with, and the parasitic
habit laid under contribution for an explanation.
   Of the many valuable pieces of work done by Professor Marshall
Ward, not the least remarkable is that on the ginger-beer plant— a
model of experimental biological investigation — in which the remark
able symbiosis of yeast and bacteria is unfolded, and the idea, preg
nant for industries such as brewing, of symbiotic as distinct from
met abiotic and antibiotic, fermentation is put forward.
   In the Reports, in conjunction with Professor Frankland, upon
bacteria in water, now being presented to the Society, we have Pro
fessor Marshall Ward's most recent work, and, in connexion with it,
his probing of the question of the action of light in arresting the
development of and killing bacteria — to mention only one of the
many points raised in the Reports — has already brought out striking
results, the significance of which, from a sanitary point of view, is
sufficiently apparent, and it has led to other investigations by the
author into the wide question of the function of colour in the vegetable
kingdom, which promise to be fruitful in valuable generalisations.
   In the field of work to which I have referred, one of no ordinary
difficulty, Professor Marshall Ward has not merely increased enorm
ously onr stock of knowledge of solid fact, bnt in his dealing
with facts under review he has thrown many lights npon general

biological problems, and has, moreover, opened up many new lines of
research of immense interest in relation to economic questions.
                              The Davt Mkdal
is awarded in duplicate       to  J. H. van't Hoff and     J. A. Le Bel, in
       recognition of their important services to theoretical chemistry,
    J. H. van't Hoff was the first to introduce a definite mechanical
conception   of valency, and to connect the optical chirality displayed
by many    carbon   compounds with their chemical constitution.          The
fact that such compounds always contain at least one atom of carbon
combined in four different ways has now been fnlly established, and
the doctrine of "asymmetric" results from the quadri valence of
carbon forms the basis of the modern theory of stereo-isomerism.
    Van't Hoff's first paper upon the subject was published in Sep
tember, 1874, in the Dutch language, but appeared in 1875 under the
 title " La Chimie dans l'Bspace."
     At that time many     compounds were known which seemed to con
 stitute exceptions  to the   new generalisation, but further investigation
 has shown that these exceptions were only apparent, and are now
 included in and are explained by the theory.
     A second very important contribution to science resulted from the
 mathematical investigations of van't Hoff in reference to the pro
 perties of liquids and the condition of dissolved solids in dilute
 solutions. By these investigations he has supplied the theoretical
 explanation of the phenomena involved in the method of determining
 molecular weights, which we owe to the experimental investigations of
 Professor Raoult, and for which he received the Davy Medal last year.
     To M. J. A. Le Bel we owe an independent enunciation of the
 theory of asymmetric combinations with carbon, published in the
 ' Bull,
         de la Soc. Chim.' only two months later than the Dutch paper
 of van't Hoff, that is, in November, 1874. Le Bel has contributed
 substantially by his work on active amyl alcohol and its derivatives
 to the support of the theoiy which, as already stated, is accepted
  universally by chemists.      The justification for what appears at first a
 purely speculative hypothesis is supplied by the fact that the intro
 duction of the new views has led to the discovery of many new
 carbon compounds the existence of which could not have been pre
 viously suspected,

" Alternate Current Electrolysis." By J. Hopkinson, D.Sc,
       F.R.S., E. Wilson, and F. Lydall. Received November 2,
       —Read November 23, 1893.
    Our attention has been called to the interesting work of Messrs.
Bedell, Ballantyne, and Williamson on " Alternate Current Con
densers and Dielectric Hysteresis," in the ' Physical Review ' for
September — October, 1893. As experiments bearing upon an ana
logous subject were carried out in the Siemens Laboratory, King's
College, London, we think it may be of interest to publish them.
Our experiments were commenced in June, 1892, and were discon
tinued in the following July with the intention of resuming them at
a future time.     They are therefore not exhaustive.
   Suppose   an  alternating current to be passed through an electrolyte
between electrodes, and that the current passing and the difference of
potential are measured at intervals during the phase.          If the elec
trolytic action were perfectly reversible, we should expect to find
the potential difference to have its maximum value when the current
was zero, that is to say, when the total quantity of electricity had
also a maximum value.        One object we had in view was to ascertain
if this were the case, and, if not, to determine what amount of energy
was dissipated under different conditions.
   This is readily done, inasmuch as the work done on the voltameter
or by the voltameter in any short time is the total quantity of
current passed in the time multiplied by the potential difference.
Let a curve be drawn in which the ordinates are the coulombs and the
abscissae the volts at corresponding times : the area of this curve re
presents the work dissipated in a cycle.
   It is, of course, well known that if a current is passed through an
electrolyte, the potential difference speedily attains a certain maxi
mum value and there remains.         If an alternate current is passed, we
should expect to find that as the number of coulombs passed in each

 half period increased, the potential difference would also increase,
 nntil it attained the value given with a continuous current, and that
 when this value was attained, the curve of potential and time would
 exhibit a flat top for all higher numbers of coulombs passed.                  We
 thought it possible that from the number of coulombs per unit of
 section required to bring the potential difference to its full value, we
 could obtain an idea of how thick a coating of the ions sufficed to
 secure that the surface of the plate had the chemical quality of the
 ion and not of the substance of the plate.
                                 Platinum Plates.
    Part I. — In the first instance, two cells having platinum platesfor elec
 trodes were used.      We are indebted to Messrs. Johnson and Mafcthey
 for the loan of these plates. They have each an area of 150 sq. cm.
 exposed to one another within the electrolyte, and are placed in a
 porcelain vessel ^ in. apart.            Pieces of varnished wood were
 placed at the back of each plate so as to prevent conduction between
 the -outside surfaces through the fluid.          The solution used was of
 water 100 parts by volume, and HsSO« 5 parts.               Fig. 1 gives a dia
 gram of connections, in which A, B are the terminals of a Siemens
                                       Fig. 1.
 W12 alternator, C, C are the cells above described, in series with
 which is placed a non-inductive resistance, DE. By means of a two-
way switch, F, one of Lord Kelvin's quadrant electrometers, Q, could
be placed across the cells C, C or the non-inductive resistance DE
through a revolving contact- maker," K, fixed to the shaft of the alter
nator.    A condenser of about 1 m.f. capacity was placed across the
terminals of the electrometer.

                   Alternate Current Electrolysis.                   409
   From observations of  the values of the E.M.F. across the cells C, C
at different times in a period, a Curve   A (figs. 2, 3, 4) was plotted,
giving potential in terms of time.

   In  the same way the Curve B was plotted for the E.M.F. between
D   and E, giving the current in terms of time. Hence the area of
this Curve B up to any point, plus a constant, is proportional to the
quantity of electricity corresponding to that point. This is shown in
Curve C, which is the integral of B. The three curves, Nos. 1, 2, 3,
in fig. 5, have been plotted from figs. 2, 3, 4 respectively, and show
the cyclic variation of the potential across the cells in volts, and the

 quantity of electricity in coulombs.       The area of each curve (see
Table  I) is a measure  of  the energy dissipated per cycle, and since in
this case there can be no accumulation of recoverable energy at the
end of the cycle, it follows that the whole difference between what is
spent during one part of the process and what is recovered during
the other part is dissipated.     In order to obtain an idea of the effi
ciency to be looked for when used as a condenser with platinum
plates ^ in. apart and dilute sulphuric acid, under varying conditions
as to maximum coulombs, the area ABC (Curve 1, fig. 5) has been
taken and is a measure of the total energy spent upon the cell ; whilst
the area DBC is a measure of the energy recovered — the ratio of
these areas gives the efficiency.
   Part II. — In the next set of experiments    the frequency was varied,
in addition to current ;   and in order to allocate the losses of poten
tial in the cell, the platinum plates were placed £ in. apart for the

  purpose of introducing an electrode into the fluid between the plates.
  This electrode consists of a platinum -wire sealed into a glass tube
  which was capable of being placed in any desired position between
  the plates.      The solution was, as before, of water 100 parts and
  H,SOi 5 parts by volume.
     The arrangement of connections was similar to that shown in fig. 1,
 but, instead of observing the potential between the two platinum
 plates, observations were taken of the values of E.M.F. between one
 plate and the exploring electrode.
     Table   II  gives particulars of the experiments tried, and two sets of
 results are shown in figs. 6 and 7, in each of which, from observa
 tions of the values of E.M.F. between the exploring electrode and the
 platinum plate at different times in a period, a Curve At was plotted,
 giving potential in terms of time.          This Curve A[ is peculiar, in that
 the ordinates at corresponding points in the two half periods are
 not equal to one another, as is the case in Curve A, which gives the
 potentials across the two plates.

    The Curve Ai gives, at any epoch, the potential taken up in the
evolution of gas at the surface of the plate, plus the potential due to
the current in overcoming the resistance of the electrolyte itself.          To
separate these quantities experiments were made upon the resistance
of the electrolyte for varying frequencies and currents. To this end
the plates were placed about 2 in. apart in the fluid, and two exploring
electrodes, as already described, were placed within the fluid in a
straight line drawn perpendicularly between the faces of the plates,
the distance       between the electrodes being 4'3 cm.       Some difficulty
was experienced, owing to the gases being given off at the plates more
rapidly in some cases than in others.             We, however, estimate that
the resistance of a layer of the electrolyte, of a thickness equal to the
distance between the electrode and plate, and of area equal to the
area of plate submerged, in figs. 6 and 7, was approximately 0-0056
ohm.
   In   fig. 6 the Curve      A, is the result of correcting Curve Ai for

time.    Curve B gives current in amperes in terms of time, whilst C
is the integral of B and gives quantity in coulombs.        With this fre
quency and current the energy dissipated on resistance of the electro
lyte is a large proportion of the total energy dissipated ; and only about
40 per cent, of the total energy is taken up in evolving oxygen and
hydrogen at the plate, owing to the high frequency. The reverse of
this is the case with lower frequency, as will be shown in connection
with fig. 7.
   From observations on the direction in which the electrometer
needle was deflected for a given position of a Clark's cell connected
to its terminals, we were able to state, for a given half period in
the curves in figs. 6 and 7, which gas was being given off at the
plate.

    The abscissae of Curves Nos. 1 and 2 (fig. 8) have been plotted from
Carves Aj and A2 respectively in fig. 6, the ordinates being given for
corresponding epochs by the integral Curve C.
    Curve No. 1 (fig. 8) shows the cyclic variation of the potential
between the electrode and the platinum plate, in terms of coulombs.
Curve No. 2 shows the cyclic variation of the potential used in
decomposition, also in terms of coulombs.         Oxygen begins to be
directed to the plate at the point A, as then the coulombs are a
maximum and the current changes sign.         But the oxygen is evolved
on a hydrogen plate, and the E.M.F. aids the current; the work done
on the plate is negative.      This continues to point B (Curve No. 2).
After this point (B) the character of the plate is that of a layer of
oxygen and the work done becomes positive ; this continues to the
point C. The area AEB is the work returned by the plate, whilst
oxygen is being evolved on a hydrogen surface.          The area BCD is
the work done on the plate, whilst oxygen is being evolved on an
oxygen surface.     In like manner the area CDF is the work returned
by the plate whilst hydrogen is being evolved on an oxygen surface,
and FAE the work done on the plate whilst hydrogen is being evolved
on a hydrogen surface.      The above areas have been taken in square
centimetres, and are given in Table III.      The area inclosed by Curve
No. 2 (25"3 sq. cm.) represents the total energy dissipated by electro
lytic hysteresis, whilst the area of Curve No. 1 (63-5 sq. cm.) gives
the total energy spent in the cell. The abscissae of Curve No. 3 are
the differences    of potential differences of Curves Nos. 1 and 2,
the ordinates, as before, being coulombs.          In fig. 8, 1 sq. cm.
     \
 = volt x 10~2 coulomb.
    In fig. 7 the frequency is 2"4 per second, and this is the case in
which practically the whole of the energy dissipated in the cell is
spent in decomposing the electrolyte at the plates.     The correction to
be applied to Curve A, for resistance is so small as to be almost
negligible.     The cyclic curve in fig. 9 has been plotted from
Curve Ai and the integral Curve C, and its area (146-7 sq. cm.)
represents the energy dissipated per cycle by electrolytic hysteresis.
Areas have been taken in square centimetres from the curve, as in
the preceding case, and are given in Table III.       In fig. 9, 1 sq. cm.
 = ^ volt x 10-* coulomb.
   The potential curve in fig. 7 does not exhibit a level part at the
highest potential ; this is possibly due to the resistance of liberated
gas.
   A   general conclusion of the experiments is that about one-tenth of
a coulomb suffices to     fully polarise 150 sq. cm. of platinum. This
 will liberate 0-00001 of a gram of hydrogen ; hence 0-00000007 gram
 of hydrogen serves to polarise 1 sq. cm. of platinum. 0'00000007 cm.

      The Experimental Proof that the Colours of certain Lepido-

  1885 (pp. 269 — 315),       I  brought forward many reasons for regarding
  certain elements of the colouring of Lepidopterous larvae as modified
  chlorophyll derived from the food plant. For this altered pigment
  the name metachlorophyll was suggested (he. cit., p. 270).                    Many
  other observations, subsequently made, supported the same conclu
 sion; but it was not until the summer of last year (1892) that I was
 able successfully to carry out the critical experiment, viz., selecting a
  species of larva which normally eats green leaves, to feed it from the
 egg upon parts of the plant from which all colouring matter is
 absent.
      This experiment was carried out in the following manner : —
      A   captured female of Tryphwna pronuba laid many hundreds of
 eggs in a chip box.          The first larvae began to appear September 7,
 1893.       On this and the subsequent dates, the larvse intended for the
 purposes of these experiments were arranged in three sets, fed re
 spectively upon— (1) the yellow etiolated leaves from the central part
 of the heart of the cabbage, (2) the white mid-ribs of such leaves
 from which the yellow blade was carefully removed with scissors,
 (3) the deep green external leaves of the same plant.
      In all other essential respects the conditions of the three sets were
 the same.       All were kept in the dark to prevent the change of the
 etiolin into chlorophyll.          They were only exposed to light during the
 times necessary for comparison and feeding, and these are indicated
 below.       A few were kept in glass cylinders standing on plates, the
 majority being confined in white earthenware pots covered at first
 with white muslin, but subsequently with glass sheets. Eventually
 all were kept in pots.                                                       i
      It is clear that the only essential difference between the conditions
 of the sets was the fact that the food of the first contained etiolin but
     * Lord Kelvin   states that in " any ordinary liquid " the mean distance between
                                                   "
the centres of contiguous molecules is, with a very high degree of probability,"
less than 00000002 and greater than O-OOOOOOOOl           of a centimetre. See ' Roy.

4L8     Mr. E. B. Poulton.     Experimental   Proof  that the Colours
no   chlorophyll, while the food of the second contained only a little
etiolin, and that so situated (aronnd the fibrovascular bandies and
buried deeply in the substance of the mid -ribs) that the larva? could
not make use of it, while the food of the third contained abundant
chlorophyll.
   It is evident that any constant difference between the larval colours
in the three sets followed from these differences in the food supplied
them ; and, unless there are reasons for believing that the differences
were due to pathological change, and thus an indirect result of the
food, we must held that they are a direct result, and that important
elements of the larval colouring are dependent on the existence of some
modification of pigments derived from their food.
   The course of the experiment will now be described in a tabular
form.

      of certain Larvce   are. due to  Pigments derived from Food.       425
    Before discussing the conclusions, it will be best to consider the
possible effect of certain conditions incidental to the experiments.
    Darkness. — The almost continuous darkness probably affected the
colours of the larvae in (1) and (3), as they became mature.             The
adult larvae of T. pronuba are sometimes bright green ; and some of
the larvae, hatched from the batch of eggs which supplied these ex
periments, reared by Miss L. J. Gould in the light and with green
surroundings, remained a distinct, although dark, green until
maturity, quite unlike any of those referred to above.
    Although it is thus probable that the larvae are sensitive* like so
many others, to the colour and degree of illumination of their sur
roundings, the results of these experiments are not affected in any
essential respect ; for there was abundant opportunity for comparison
before the changes referred to had taken place (e.g., October 10),
and when the majority of the larvaB in (1) and (3) were green (see
 Plate 3, fig. 1). Furthermore it is also evident that the comparison
•was equally valid after the change had taken place, inasmuch aa the
brown ground colour, no less than the green, is shown to be due to a
modified plant pigment.
    Nutritive Value of Pigmentless Food. — The extremely slow growth
of the larvae fed upon the white mid-ribs, and the death of all except
 one of them in an early stage, may be looked upon as an argument
that they were in a pathological condition, one result being the in*
ability to form a certain kind of pigment.           Such an interpretation
 would, of course, upset the conclusions     I  have arrived at.
    On the other hand, it may be urged that the single larva in (2)
 which survived until it was advanced in the last stage was certainly
 not pathological, and yet was unable to form the pigments in question.
 Although it grew very slowly in early youth, it began to be con
 spicuous by its size on November 2, and from this date it grew
 rapidly and fed largely (see Plate 4, figs. 1 and 2) ; judged by all
standards, it was perfectly healthy.           Furthermore, everyoue who
 breeds   larvae knows that   they are  subject to diseases of various kinds,
 and yet, so far as I am aware, the complete inability to form certain
 classes of pigment has not been recognised as a symptom.          Moreover,
 the larvse fed on the thick succulent etiolated leaves (1) grew far more
 rapidly then those fed on green leaves (3). This species hybernates
 in the larval state, and, as is usually the case in such species, the
 rate of growth is extremely irregular.        Many of the larvae reared by
 Miss Gould, and single larva? fed upon green leaves by me, lagged far
 behind the others and yet remained healthy.
    I believe that the retarding effect of the mid-ribs was not due to the
 absence of plant pigments, but to the rapid drying and oxidation of
 the cut surfaces (left by the removal of the rest of the leaf) and the
 inability of the young larvce to get sufficient food from other parts,

426     Mr. E. B. Poulton.      Experimental   Proof  that the Colours
¦where   the tough cuticle could not be easily penetrated by their small
¦weak    mandibles.   The larger larva? do not experience the same
difficulty.
   It will be well, however, to repeat the experiment with other larvte,
some of which may be expected to have greater powers of endurance.
I  would suggest Mamestra brassicm and Phlogophora meticulosa as
suitable for the purpose.        Freshly cut mid-ribs might be offered
every day or perhaps twice a day.
   Conclusions from the Experiments.    — Assuming that the results ob
tained in Experiment (2) are not pathological, and I believe that
this assumption is justified, it follows that etiolin (1), no less than
chlorophyll (3), can be transformed into a larval colouring matter,
which may be either green or brown, and is so disposed as to form a
ground colour.
   The fact that brown pigments may be thus formed is new. In my
previous paper (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' 1885, pp. 269 et seq.)          I gave
reasons for the conclusion that the green pigments are derived from
plants, but argued that brown pigments are proper to the larva.
This still remains true iu many cases. Thus the green larva? of
Amphidasis betularia, investigated in 1892, are coloured by derived
pigments contained in the superficial fat, while the brown larva? are
coloured by true pigment contained in the epidermic cells (' Trans.
Ent. Soc. Lond.,' 1892, pp. 357 — 359), so that the green fat which lies
beneath is concealed.     The intensely opaque and dark larva of many
other Geometra? are probably similarly coloured by true pigments in
the cuticle or epidermis.      But the brown ground colour of many
Noctua larva? will probably be found to be due, like that of T. pronuba,
to modified plant pigments.
   A comparison of the larva? fed on pigmentless food (Plate 3, fig. 2,
Plate 4, figs. 1 — 3) with those fed upon etiolated leaves (Plate 3,
fig. 1) and the similar larva? fed upon green leaves, proves that both
 green and brown ground colours are modified plant pigments. "When
the larva? fed on etiolin were being compared on October 10, one of
them became irritated and expelled a drop of fluid from its mouth.
 This fluid was of a faintly bluish-green colour.        This observation
 suggests that the change of etiolin into a soluble green pigment takes
place in the digestive tract. Chlorophyll similarly becomes soluble
and forms a green solution (turning brown on exposure) in the di
 gestive tract of larva?.   It is possible that the brown ground colour
 of the larva? is also a result of oxidation : at any rate, it is a change
in the direction of greater stability ; for I have shown that the colours
of certain brown larvce, evidently coloured like those of T. pronuba,
 are far more persistent after preservation than those of the green
 varieties of the same species (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' 1885. pp. 275, 276).
    Although the brown ground colour, probably situated in this

      of certain Larva;    are due to Pigments derived         from Food.          427
species in the epidermic        cells, is thus derived, there is an abundant
deposit of true pigment in the form of spots and patches in the
superficial cuticle. This was as distinct in the larvae of (2) as in
those fed upon etiolin or chlorophyll ; but, the ground colour of the
former being white instead of green or brown, it produced a greyish
effect (Plate 4, figs. 1 — 3).       The opaque, white stripes in the sub
dorsal   and spiracular regions are also probably due to true pigment
situated in this case in the epidermic cells, and are equally conspicuous
in the larvae fed on pigmeutless food (Plate 4, fig. 2).
   In certain parts of the body the cuticle is of relatively greater thick
ness — the head,    prothoracic dorsal plate, supra-anal plate, true legs,
and parts of the claspers.         In these situations, therefore, the com
bination of a deeply-placed ground colour composed of derived pig
ments with a superficially placed true pigment would not necessarily
produce the same effect as in the other parts of the body where the
cuticle is much thinner ; for the derived pigments would tend to be
hidden.    In these parts, therefore,     both ground colour and markings           are
cuticular, while both are composed of true pigment of such a tint as to
harmonise with the effect produced by the combination of two
distinct elements in other parts of the body. Hence these parts
remained normal in the larvae of Experiment (2), resembling the
brown larvae of the other experiments, and serving to show what the
colour of the rest of the body would have been if the plant pigments
had been present in the food (Plate 4, fig. 3).*
    Some indication was afforded in the course of these experiments
that the power of converting the plant-pigments into metachlorophyll
may be lost in larva? which have been fed from the egg for a con
siderable time upon pigmeutless food. Thus the larvae of Experiment
 (2) remained pale when fed upon leaves which caused those of Ex
periment (1) to become brown or green. At the same time it must
be remembered that these particular larvae were certainly unhealthy,
and died soon after the change of food.            I hope to repeat this experi
ment upon healthy larvae.           I have already shown that many larvaB
which are normally found upon a variety of food plants will starve
rather than eat certain of them when they have been fed upon tho
others from the egg ('Ent. Soc. Loud. Trans.,' 1887, pp. 312—314).
It is possible that a somewhat analogous " gastric education " may
take place as regards the digestive action upon plant pigments.                   Bat
confirmatory experiments, specially           directed   to  test  the   conclusion,
are much wanted.
   *
     [This argument appears to be valid in the case of the older larvae of this species
and probably many others. There are, however, many instances in which the
derived pigments are distinctly visible through an extremely thick cuticle (e.g., in
the head of larvse of the genus Smerinthus) . The distribution of the derived pig
ments has not been investigated in this case. — October 15, 1893.]

 428     Mr. E. B. Poulton.      Experimental  Proof  that the Colour*
    It  is of great interest that the etiolin should be as effective as
chlorophyll in the production of larval colours.    It is, however, prob
able that the difference between etiolin and chlorophyll is, chemically,
 extremely small, while both appear to undergo similar changes in the
 larval digestive tract, yielding a substance which becomes dark
coloured on exposure to air, probably by oxidation. Thus of the two
heaps of faeces represented in Plate 3, fig. 1, that to the left had been
exposed to the air for some hours, and was dark brown, while that to
the right was fresh and of a pale-yellow tint. A cut midrib darkens
on exposure quite independently of the plant pigments as may be
seen in the same figure; but the tint is different, and the depth of
 shade far less than in the freces containing abundant etiolin.       The
faeces of the larva fed on pigmentless food similarly darkened far
 less rapidly and to a much less extent than those of the others.
                                                    I
    Although the results of these experiments are, believe, completely
 successful in establishing the conclusion they were intended to test,
it must be admitted that they point to the beginning of an investiga
tion rather than its end. We now know that certain larval colours
are dependent on the existence of modified plant pigments, and this
naturally leads to an enquiry into the nature and causes of the
processes by which chlorophyll and etiolin are converted           in the
 animal body into a comparatively stable green or brown substance
 far removed from its original position in the digestive tract, and
situated so as to form an important element in the effective colouring
of the individual.

 etiolated leaves    of cabbage.   They had hatched September 7 and
 8 (1893) and were painted October 10.         Nearly all the shades of
colour observed in the larva? at this stage are represented in the
figure, four being various shades of green, and one brown. It is clear
from the figure that the larvae can form a de»p green colouring matter
from etiolated leaves. There was, in fact, no difference in this
respect between them and larvae fed on green leaves.
    The marked contrast in colour between the green larvae and the
leaf is some indication of the change which the etiolin has undergone
in the larval body. The dark marks along the sides are due to
superficially placed true pigment, which is formed independently of
any coloured substance in the food plant.

 fresh, and pale yellow in colour ; that to the left exposed to the    air
 for some hours, and dark brown.
    Fig.  2. — A group of three larvae, of the same species, in the 2nd
 stage, twice the natural size. Those larvae had been fed entirely upon
 the white mid-ribs of cabbage leaves. They had hatched September
 8, and were painted October 11.          While the larvae represented in
 fig. 1 were rather larger than those fed on green leaves, these are
 much smaller.       The colour is white, and maggot-like, the faint
 greyish    appearance  being due to superficial true pigment. Except
 upon the head, there is not a trace of either the green or the brown
 ground colour invariably found in the larvae of this species tinder
 normal conditions.     Furthermore, these larvae are uniform in appear
ance, although the normal larvae are extremely variable.
    A comparison between figs. 1 and 2 proves that the brown or green
 ground colour of the species is due to some modification of etiolin
 (or chlorophyll in the case of normal larvra), unless indeed the results
 are to be explained as pathological — an interpretation opposed to tbo
 facts represented in the figures on Plate 4.

was evidently quite healthy, although all the others were dead by
November 21. On December 2 it was painted (natural size) in
two positions, being in the 4th stage.        The ground colour remained
white or cream-coloured ; the grey effect being caused by superficial
true pigment, which is seen to be especially marked upon the brown
head, claspers, thoracic legs, prothoracic, and supra- anal plates, and
upon the dark subdorsal semilunar marks.
    Fig. 2. —The last skin was changed by December 18, and, on the
29th, the larva was again painted of the natural size, when advanced
in the last stage. The ground colour remained the same, but an
increase in the true pigment caused the larva to become a darker
shade of grey.      A row of supra-spiracular dark markings also made
their appearance.      The white subdorsal line and, perhaps, the spira-
cular line were evidently due to some cause of colour (probably pig
mentary) distinct from that on which the pale ground colour of the
general body surface depended.
    Fig. 3. — At the same date the head and        anterior segments were
painted, X 4 diameters. In those parts where the cuticle is thickened,
the head, prothoracic plate, and thoracic legs, a brown ground colour
(as well as tho black spots and patches) is developed from true pig
ment in the cuticle itself. Hence these parts remain normal when

tho larvae  are fed upon leaves without chlorophyll or etiolin.      But
over the general surface of the body the cuticle is very thin, and
only contains the black spots and patches of true pigment, while the
brown or green ground colour, derived from plant pigments, is sub
cuticular in position. Hence in a larva fed on pigmentless parts of
leaves, represented in fig. 3, this latter ground colour is replaced by
a creamy tint which is due to the uncoloured tissues of the body,
especially the fat, and to the contents of the digestive tract.     This
creamy ground    colour, combined   with   the spots of true pigment  in
the cuticle, produces the general greyish appearance of these larvae.
   The posterior segments of the larva, painted at the same date,
 X 4 diameters, are also represented in the figure, indicating that the
thickened cuticle of the supra-anal plate (which possessed a sharper
outline than that represented in the figure) contains both brown
ground colour and black spots of true pigment, while the general
surface presents the combination of a white ground colour and dark
spots, conferring a grey appearance.

     Having been engaged in studying the development                     of Asterina
 gibbosa   during the past year,        I   think it advisable to publish an
 account of the results already obtained, as these are of considerable
 interest, and    it may be long before       I can  complete my investigation.
 As this     is only a preliminary account,          I  shall ignore statements
 which    conflict    with my results, noticing only the results of other
 workers in so far as they confirm my work.
    The classic research of Ludwig* on this subject is well known.
 The advances        I have been able to make on his work concern chiefly
 the later larval stages and the metamorphosis.
    Ludwig finds a regular segmentation, giving rise to a ciliated
blastula ; typical embolic invagination follows, and the blastopore,
placed at first in the centre of the ventral surface, is carried by
 growth to near the posterior end, and functions for a short time as
larval anus.        In the meantime the archenteron becomes divided, into
 an anterior thin-walled portion, and a posterior thick-walled one.
 The latter becomes separated as the definitive gut, which is soon
joined by the larval oesophagus, which arises as an ectodermic invagin
 ation, the former becomes the coalom, sending back a horn on each side
 of the gut.     On the left side, in the praeoral portion of the ccelom, we
 find a pore opening to the exterior — the madreporic pore.

   My results diverge from those of Imdwig at this point.                What
follows is the result of my own work. The coelom becomes segmented, as
shown in Jig. 1, and the arrangement of its divisions strongly recalls that

of Balanoglossus.       By the outgrowth of a pair of vertical transverse
septa, a pair of posterior ccelomic cavities is separated off (3' 3', fig. 1),
this separation being for a time incomplete ventrally.                Simulta
neously, two outgrowths from the anterior cavity appear, growing
backward, and overlapping to some extent the posterior cavities.             Of
these, the left opens for a long while by a wide aperture into the
anterior cavity, whilst the right is almost immediately completely
segmented off.
    These are the paired rudiments of the water-vascular system, the
right and the left hydroccele.     In one larva    I  found them equally de
veloped, but usually the right hydroccele has the form of a small
closed ;vesicle,    which persists   for life in the neighbourhood of the
madreporite.       These  cavities   I  compare to the collar cavities of
Balanoglossus,     and find support for this view in the structure of
Gephalodiscus, where the collar cavities are prolonged into long,
piwnately -branched arms, comparable to the radial canals of the water-
vascular system of Echinoderms, with their rows of tube feet.
   There is no hcemoccele in Asterina gibbosa ; all cavities lined tcith

epithelium are derived from the coelpm.           The radial perihcemal canals
and their connecting outer circular perihernial canal are derived from
interradial diverticula of the ccelom, one of which (PA., fig. 1) is
shown in the figure.           The longitudinal septa in tho radial canals are
due to the apposed walls of adjacent interradial rudiments.                        The
axial sinus (ax., fig. 1) surrounding the stone canal is the posterior
division of the anterior body cavity into which the pore canal opens.
 Bury* states that in a future paper he will prove this, but he has
 not fulfilled his promise.        The stone canal is a groove in the neck of
communication between the anterior ccelomic cavity ; it becomes con
stricted off, and forms a tube opening at its distal end into the axial
sinus, close to the inner end of the madreporic pore canal.                       This
arrangement has been seen by Ludwig, but what he has not seen is
that it persists in the adult, and hence he failed to recognise the
 rudiment of the axial sinus.
    The dorsal organ, the heart or " central-blutgeflecht," is nothing
 more than an ingrowth of the left posterior ccelom into the septum
 separating the posterior ccelomic cavities from the axial sinus (d, fig. 1).
 It soon becomes solid. From its npper end in the adult the genital
 rachis grows out, as Cuenotf inferred, and           I  have elsewhere proved.J
     Since the genital organs are formed later, as local swellings of this
 rachis, the ultimate origin of the sexual cells, in Asterina as in
 Vertebrata and Annelida, is ccelomic epithelium. The aboral sinus
 surrounding the genital rachis is formed from a special diverticulum
 of the ccelom.
     As Ludwig has pointed out, the prseoral part of the larva becomes
 converted      into a special locomotor organ.            It is foot-shaped, has
 long    cilia, and also   functions  like  a  tube-foot,   as a temporary fixing
 organ.       Ludwig did not observe, however, that dnring the meta
 morphoses, having given up its locomotor functions, is converted into a
permanent fixing organ or stalk. This arrangement persists for some
 time after the larva has acquired the adult form, for it is for a time
 unable to use its tube feet, and when displaced from its attachment floats
 helplessly about. Bury§ has shown that the stalk of Crinoids is
 likewise the prreoral lobe, and the free swimming larva of Antedon
 strongly resembles that of Asterina, the main difference being that
 the larval mouth, which soon closes in Asterina, is never formed in
 Antedon, in which also the anterior body cavity is of less extent,

the left side (left hydroccele and left posterior body cavity), soon

teaches us that Asterina and Antedon have diverged in two opposite
directions. In Antedon an excessive growth of the ventral surface
has rotated mouth and hydroccele backwards and upwards away
from the stalk (fig. 3). A precisely similar change to this takes
 place, as we know, in Giona and Pedicellina, and it is to place the
mouth in a favourable position to catch pelagic prey.           In Asterina, on

   The second specimen was obtained by the Rev. Dr. Gordon, of
Elgin, from the qnarry at Spynie, where the Telerpeton Elginense
was found, and will be deposited in the British Museum. In this
fossil the bones were present, and the skull, thanks to the manipu
lative skill of Mr. J. Hall, of the British Mnseum, is still preserved,
but many of the other bones were too mnch crumbled to show their
form, and the casting process was again resorted to.       This specimen
most have been entire when buried in the sandy matrix, but the
neck and fore limbs are now wanting.            The resemblance of this
fossil to Aetosaurus was noticed by Mr. A. Smith Woodward when it
was exhibited at one of the Royal Society Soirees.           The skull is
about ty inches long, sharp anteriorly, and Bird-like when seen from
above, but deep when seen from the side.         There is oh each side a
laterally placed nasal aperture, a large prelachrymal fossa, a wide
orbit, and an infratemporal fossa.      The teeth are of different sizes,
but all seem to have been lanceolate, recurved, compressed, and
serrated anteriorly and posteriorly as in Palceosaurus and Cladyodon.
The palate is deep, and a median pair of apertures near the post-
palatine vacuities are believed to be primitive posterior nares, placed
far back, somewhat as in Belodon.       This skull closely resembles that
of Ceratosaurus. The more anterior of the thirteen presacral vertebrae
which are present have distinct capitular and tubercular articula
tions for the ribs, but these gradually unite, and in the hindermost
there is but one process with, perhaps, two articular surfaces at the
extremity. All the vertebra are biconcave.          The sacrum includes
three vertebra? with large and expanded ribs. There are twenty-one
caudal vertebra present, which have long neural and haomal spines.
The ilium is Crocodilian in form, but not so high as in Stagonolepis,
and thus approaches to the Dinosaurian type. The ischia are elongated
bones, but the pubes are still longer and are directed forwards.      The
tibia and fibula must have been about the same length as the femur,
which is nearly 4£ inches long, and Crocodilian in form. The astra
galus is free, and has some resemblance to that of a Crocodile ; there
are five metatarsals, and the number of the phalanges is — to the first
digit 2, to the second 3, to the third 4, to the fourth 5, to the fifth 3
or more.      Many oval scutes are seen scattered above the neural
spines, the anterior and larger ones being ornamented with irregular
radiating pittings and ridges.
   This reptile seems to be intermediate between the Dinosaurians
and Crocodilians.       The skull and teeth are most like those of
Dinosaurs ; the pelvis and limbs might belong to either Dinosaurs or
Crocodiles ; while the free astragalus is certainly a Crocodilian
character.     Provisionally this reptile is referred to the Theropodous
Dinosauria, and is named Ornithosuchits Woodwardi.

        Medium." By Joseph Larmor, F.R.S., Fellow of St.
        John's College, Cambridge.            Received November 15,

                                 (Abstract.)
    Ever since the causes of natural phenomena began to attract atten
tion, the interaction of the different classes of physical agencies has
been taken to suggest that they are all manifestations in different
ways of the energy of some fundamental medium ; and the efforts of
the more sanguine class of naturalists have always been in some
measure directed towards the discovery of the properties of this
medium.      It is only at the end of the last century that the somewhat
vague principle of the economy of action or effort in physical actions
—which, like all other general principles in the scientific explanation
of Nature, is ultimately traceable to a kind of metaphysical origin—
has culminated in the hands of Lagrange in his magnificent mathem
atical generalisation of the dynamical laws of material systems.
Before the date of this concise and all-embracing formulation of the
laws of dynamics there was not available any engine of sufficient
power and generality to allow of a thorough and exact exploration of
the properties of an ultimate medium, of which tho mechanism and
mode of action are almost wholly concealed from view. The precise
force of Lagrange's method, in its physical application, consists in
its allowing us to ignore or leave out of account altogether the
details of the mechanism, whatever it is, that is in operation in the
phenomena under discussion ; it makes everything depend on a single
analytical function representing the distribution of energy in the
medium in terms of suitable co-ordinates of position and of their
velocities ; from the location of this energy, its subsequent play and
the dynamical phenomena involved in it are all deducible by straight
forward mathematical analysis.
    The problem of the correlation of the physical forces is thus
divisible into two parts, (i) the determination of the analytical
function which represents the distribution of energy in the primordial
medinm which is assumed to be the ultimate seat of all phenomena,
and (ii) the discussion of what properties may be most conveniently
and simply assigned to this medium, in order to describe the play of
energy in it most vividly, in terms of the stock of notions which we
have derived from the observation of that part of the interaction of
natural forces which presents itself directly to our senses, and is
formulated under the name of natural law.        It may be held that the
first part really involves in itself the solution of the whole problem ;
that the second part is rather of the nature of illustration and ex

 planation, by comparison of the intangible primordial medium -with
 other dynamical systems of which we can directly observe the
 phenomena.
    The chief representative of     exact  physical   specnlation of the
 second of these types has been Lord Kelvin. In the older attempts
 of this kind the dynamical basis of theories of the constitution of the
 tether consisted usually in a play of forces, acting at a distance,
 between ultimate elements of molecules of the medium       ; from this we
 must, however, except the speculations of Greek philosophy and the
 continuous vortical theories of the school of Descartes, which were
 of necessity purely descriptive and imaginative, not built in a con
 nected manner on any rational foundation.      It has been in particular
 the aim of Lord Kelvin to deduce material phenomena from the play
 of inertia involved in the motion of a structureless primordial fluid ;
 if this were achieved it would reduce the duality, rather the many-
 sidedness, of physical phenomena to a simple unity of scheme ; it
 would be the ultimate conceivable simplification. The celebrated
 vortex theory of matter makes the- indestructible material atoms
 consist in vortex rings in a primordial fluid medium, structureless,
 homogeneous, and frictionless, and makes the forces between the
 atoms which form the groundwork of less fundamental theories
 consist in the actions excited by these vortices on one another
 through the inertia of the fluid which is their basis — actions which are
 instantaneously transmitted if the fluid is supposed to be absolutely
 incompressible.
    In case this foundation proves insufficient, there is another idea of
 Lord Kelvin's by which it may be supplemented.        The characteristic
 properties of radiation, which forms so prominent an element in
 actual phenomena, can be explained by the existence of an elastic
 medium for its transmission at a finite, though very great, speed ;
such a medium renders an excellent account of all its relations, if we
assume it to possess inertia and to be endowed with some elastic
quality of resistance to disturbance roughly analogous to what we can
observe and study in ordinary elastic solids of the relatively incom
pressible kind, such as india-rubber and jellies. Lord Kelvin has been
the promoter and developer of a view by which the elastic forces
between parts of such a medium may be to some extent got rid of as
ultimate elements, and be explained by the inertia of a spinning
motion of a dynamically permanent kind, which is distributed
throughout its volume.     If we imagine very minute rapidly-spinning
fly-wheels   or gyrostats spread through the medium, they will retain
their motion for ever, in the absence of friction on their axles, and
they will thus form a concrete dynamical illustration of a type of
elasticity which arises solely from inertia ; and this illustration will
be of great use in realising some of the peculiarities of a related

type, which    I    believe    can be thoroughly established          as the actual
type of elasticity transmitting all radiations, whether luminous and
thermal or electrical — for they are all one and the same — through
the ultimate medium of fluid character of which the vortices consti
tute matter.
   It has always been the great puzzle of theories of radiation how
the medium which conveys it by transverse vibrations, such as we
know directly only in media of the elastic-solid type, could yet be so
yielding as to admit of the motion of the heavenly bodies through it
absolutely without resistance.      According to the view of the consti
tution of the aether which is developed in this paper, not only are
these different properties absolutely consistent with each other, but it
is, in fact, their absolute and rigorous coexistence which endows the
medium with the qualities necessary for the explanation of a further
very wide class of phenomena.           The remark which       the key to
                                                                      is
this matter has been already thrown out by Lord Kelvin, in con
nexion with Sir George Stokes's suggested explanation of the astro
nomical aberration of light. The motion of the ultimate homogeneous
frictionless fluid medium, conditioned by the motion of the vortices
existing in   it, is, outside these vortices, of an absolutely irrotational
character.    Now, suppose the medium         endowed with elasticity of a
                                               is
purely rotational type, so that its elastic quality can be called into
play only by absolute rotational displacement of the elements of the
medium just as motion of translation of a spinning gyrostat calls
        ;
into play no reaction, while any alteration of the absolute position of
its axis in space       resisted by an opposing couple.
                        is                                As regards the
motion of the medium involved in the movements of its vortices, this
rotational elasticity remains completely latent, as         did not exist

and we can at once set down the whole theory of the vortical hydro-
dynamical constitution of matter as a part of the manifestations of an
ultimate medium of this kind.

constitution of the sather as regards the phenomena of radiation,

the general question.
   The true nature of the phenomena of light had been brought to
view at the beginning of the present century by the intuition of
Thomas Toung and the secret of the exact quantitative mathe
                    ;
matical laws which govern the behaviour of light in all the various
circumstances   attending its propagation, reflexion, and refraction
had been fathomed in      marvellous manner by the genius of Fresnel.
                              a
The nature of the mathematical reasoning by which Fresnel was led
to his results has for the most part never been understood   and, as       ;
presented by him in his writings,        certainly seems devoid of

dynamical coherence and formal logical validity.      Yet, the more the
phenomena     of  light  were afterwards  experimentally examined, the
stronger was the confirmation of the whole scheme of formulas at
which he had arrived.
   The explanation of the laws of physical optics advanced by Fresnel,
and verified by comparison with the phenomena, which was possible
in several very exact ways, chiefly by himself and Brewster, was,
about the year 1835, engaging the attention of several of the chief
mathematicians of that time — Angustin Canchy in France, Franz
Neumann      in Germany, George Green in England, and James
MacCullagh      in Ireland.    The prevalent mode of attacking the
problem was through the analogy with the propagation of elastic
waves in solid bodies ; and the comparison of Fresnel's laws of pro
pagation in crystalline media with the results of the mathematical
theory of the elasticity of crystalline bodies gave abundance of
crucial tests for the verification, modification, or disproof of the
principles assumed in these investigations. The treatment of Cauchy
is earliest in date, but somewhat empirical and unsatisfactory in its
logical aspects in the light of subsequent more precise knowledge of
the conditions of the problem of the elasticity of solids.     The treat
ment of Neumann is also a sound and original piece of investigation,
if we except the limited view of the elasticity of solids, that of Navier
and Poisson, on which he based it.      The treatment by Green had the
great distinction of incidentally laying, with all the generality and
simplicity which we expect in an ultimate theory, the foundations on
which every theory of elastic action in ordinary material bodies must
in future be constructed ; it proceeded, in fact, on the basis of one of
those great generalisations, of which the aggregate constitutes the
all-embracing modern doctrine of energy.        These three authors all
treated the question of reflexion and refraction of waves.        Cauchy
could not make much of Fresnel's formulae in any logical manner.
Neumann had the merit of seeing clearly that the thing was impos
sible on his elastic solid theory ; so he dropped it altogether, assumed
a sufficient number of principles which might be taken, with fair
probability, in accordance with general reasoning, to be satisfied in
the reflexion and refraction of light rays, viz., complete continuity of
the media and continuity of energy in crossing the boundary at
which the reflexion and refraction take place, and had the satisfac
tion of evolving a solution which agreed with Fresnel's laws, and
easily extended them to the much more complicated circumstances of
crystalline media.      But to obtain this solution he assumed, from
what   he  found   necessary to make his very imperfect theory of pro
pagation in crystals agree with Fresnel's laws, that the density of the
luminiferous medium is the same in all bodies, and that the displace
ment of plane-polarised light is in the plane of polarisation. It may

be shown, as is now indeed to be expected, that this is a totally wrong
foundation to work upon, that Neumann's general principles for the
solution of the problem of reflexion are inconsistent with his elastic
 theory.    If he had adopted a converse procedure, and worked out the
problem of the reflexion of a ray on his general principles, and then
deduced, by comparison with Fresnel's formulas, the law of density of
the luminiferous medium and the direction of the vibration in plane-
polarised light, he would have been entitled to the credit of a joint
discoverer in the domain of the dynamics of reflexion.      But, for the
reasons here indicated, the credit of that discovery must,   I  think, be
assigned to MacCnllagh.
   The achievements by which the memory of MacCullagh is now to
a great extent preserved are his very elegant investigations in the
domain of pure Euclidian geometry.         He may be claimed to be an
instance of the numerous cases from Archimedes down through
Descartes, Newton, and, we may add, Thomas Young, in which keen
geometrical insight has formed a key for unlocking the formal laws
of physical actions.       He was first attracted to Fresnel's laws oi
optics by the very simple and elegant geometrical relations to which
they lead.     At a later period he proposed to himself the problem to
hit off the extension of Fresnel's laws of reflexion which would apply
to crystalline media, in the light of the crucial conditions afforded by
the delicate experiments of Brewster and, at a later stage, Seebeck,
to which such a theory must conform.        He had thus to cast about
for geometrical principles on which Fresnel's laws might be founded,
such as would admit of easy extension to the more general problem.
He early came npon the principle of continuity of the media, which
he put in the geometrical form that the resultant of the displace
ments in the refracted waves is equal to the resultant of the dis
placements in the incident and reflected waves. As regards the other
necessary condition, he was not at first successful.      The density of
the medium he took to be the same in all bodies, because he could not
imagine it to be fflolotropic, or different in different directions, in
crystalline media.      He assumed the vibrations to be in the plane of
polarisation,   from  considerations of geometrical symmetry and neces
sity, confirmed in the earlier stage by one of the theories of Cauchy.
The other condition above referred to he took to be equality of
certain pressures in the media, as imagined by Cauchy ; and by this
means he arrived at a satisfactory explanation of Brewster's obser
vations on the polarising angle in reflexion from crystals. But
Seebeck pointed oat that this solution would not account for the
values of the deviation of the plane of polarisation from the plane of
reflexion, by means of which he had himself tested it.         Owing to
this criticism MacCullagh was finally led to abolish Cauchy's notion
of pressure, and assume simply the continuity of energy in its place.

 This principle of energy, which gives a quadratic equation between
 the displacements   at the interface, he succeeded to his satisfaction, as
 regards the confirmation of bis views, in replacing by linear relations.
 And then he gave his two magnificent geometrical theorems — that of
 transversals and that of the polar plane, which contain each in a
 sentence the complete specification of the laws of reflexion for the
 most general     case   of a transparent medium, and which form
 the culmination of the geometrical relations by which he was
 guided throughout this whole process of synthetical discovery. His
 laws of reflexion are the same as Neumann's ; of them, as formal
 laws, these two authors must be regarded as the independent dis
 coverers — Neumann by a happy assumption suggested by reasoning
 at bottom illogical in the light of subsequent knowledge, MacCullagh
 by a resolute attack on the observed facts with a view to reducing
 them to simple formulae.
    But the greatest achievement of MacCullagh is that contained in
 his memoir of 1839, two years after, entitled an
                                                         "
                                                           Essay towards a
 Dynamical Theory of Crystalline Reflexion and Refraction."            He is
 in quest of a dynamical foundation for the whole scheme of optical
laws, which had been notably extended and confirmed by himself
already.    He recognises,    I  think for the first time in a capital
 physical problem, that what is required is the discovery of the
potential-energy function of Lagrange on which the action- of the
medium depends, and that the explanation            of the form of that
function   is another  question   which  can be  treated   separately.  His
memoir is subsequent to, but apparently quite independent of, that of
Green, in which Green restricted the medium to a constitution like
an elastic solid, laid down the general laws of such constitution for
the first time, and made a magnificent failure of his attempt to
explain optical phenomena on that basis. If this thing was to he
done, the power, simplicity, and logical rigour of Green's analysis
might have been expected to do it ; and nothing further has come
of the matter until the recent new departure of Lord Kelvin in his
speculation as to a labile elastic-solid aether.       To return to Mac
Cullagh, he is easily able to hit off a simple form of the potential-
energy function, which — on the basis of Lagrange's general dynamics,
or more compactly on the basis of the law of Least Action — absolutely
sweeps the whole field of optical theory so far as all phenomena are
concerned in which absorption of the light does not play a prominent
part.    He is confident, as any one who follows him in detail must be,
that he is on the right track. He tries hard to obtain a dynamical
basis for his energy-function, that is, to imagine some material
medinm that shall serve as a model for it and illustrate its possibility
and its mode of action ; he records his failure in this respect, but at
the same time he protests against the limited view which would tie

 444            Mr.  J. Larmor.    A  Dynamical   Theory  of     [Dec. 7,
down the unknown and in several ways mysterious and paradoxical
properties of the luminiferous medium to be the same as those of an
ordinary elastic solid.
    The form of MacCullagh's energy-function was derived by him
 very easily from the consideration of the fact that it is required of it
 that it shall produce, in crystalline media, plane-polarised waves pro
pagated by displacements in the plane of the wave front.          Though
he seems to put his reasoning as demonstrative on this point, it has
been pointed out by Sir George Stokes, and is indeed obvious at
once from Green's resnlts, that other forms of the energy-function
besides MacCullagh's would satisfy this condition. But the important
point as regards MacCullagh's function is that it makes the energy
in the medium depend solely on the absolute rotational displacements
of its elements from their equilibrium orientations, not at all on its
 distortion or compression, which are the quantities on whicb the
elasticity of a solid would depend according to Green.
    Starting from this conception of rotational elasticity, it can be
shown that, if we neglect for the moment optical dispersion, every
crystalline optical medium has three principal elastic axes, and its
wave-surface is precisely that of Fresnel, while the laws of reflexion
and refraction agree precisely with experiment.       Further, it follows
from the observed fact of transparency in combination with dis
persion, that the dispersion of a wave of permanent type is properly
accounted for by the addition to the equations, therefore to the
energy -function, of subsidiary terms involving spacial differentiations
of higher order. To preserve the medium hydrodynamically a perfect
fluid, these terms also must satisfy the condition that the elasticity of
the medium is thoroughly independent of compression and distortion
of its elements, and wholly dependent on absolute rotation.        It can
be shown,     I believe, that this restriction limits the terms to two
kinds, one of which retains Fresnel's wave snrface unaltered, while
the other modifies it in a definite" manner stated without proof by
MacCullagh [ ; but the first terms depend on an interaction between
the dispersive property and the wave motion itself, while the second
terms involve the square of the dispersive quality.        It seems clear
that the second type involves only phenomena of a higher order of
small quantities than we are here considering — December 7, 1893] ;
thus an account of dispersion remains which retains Fresnel's wave
snrface unaltered for each homogeneous constituent of the light,
while it includes the dispersion of the axes of optical symmetry in
crystals as regards both their magnitudes and directions — results
quite unapproached by any other theory ever entertained.
   In this analysis of dispersions, all terms have been omitted which
possess a unilateral character, such as would be indicated in actuality
by rotatory polarisation and other such phenomena.           The laws of

1893.]              the Electric and Luminiferous Medium.                     445
crystalline material structures seem to prohibit the occurrence of
such asymmetry as these terms would indicate, except to the very
small extent evidenced by the hemihedral faces of quartz crystals.
The influence on the optical medium of this asymmetric arrangement
of the molecules must be very much smaller still, for the rotatory
terms are in all media exceedingly minute compared with the ordinary
dispersional terms.        The form of these rotatory terms in the energy-
function is at once definitely assigned by our condition of perfect
fluidity of the medium, both for crystals and for rotational liquids
such as turpentine, and this form is the one usually accepted, on
MacCullagh's suggestion, as yielding a correct account of the
phenomena.
   When dispersional terms are included in the energy function, our
continuous analysis is not any longer applicable to the problem of
reflexion ; the conditions at the interface are altogether too numerous
to be satisfied by the available variables.            There is in fact discon
tinuity'' at  the   interface   in  the  discrete  molecular   structure, such as
could not be representable by a continuous analysis.                   Bnt if we
proceed     by  the  method     of rays,  and   assume   that there   is a play of
surface forces which do not absorb any energy, while they adjust the
dispersional part of the stress, it appears that reflexion is independent
of dispersion.
   The treatment of the problem of reflexion by Fresnel involves a
different direction of vibration of the light, and different surface
conditions, from MacCullagh's.            It is of ;interest to remark that this
theory may be stated in a dynamically rigorous form, provided the
medium to which it refers possesses the properties of the labile
elastic-solid aether of Lord Kelvin ; and Fresnel's own account of his
analysis of the problem becomes more intelligible from such a stand
point.
    The mention of the phenomena of magnetic rotational quality will
introduce us to the next division of the subject, that of the inclusion
of electric and magnetic phenomena in the domain of the activity of
this primordial medium.
    The problem of the aether has been first determinedly attacked
from the side of electrical phenomena by Clerk Maxwell in quite

 sufficient material to allow the question to be profitably attacked
 from this side. Even as it is, our notions of what constitute electric
 and magnetic phenomena are of the vaguest as compared with our
 ideas of what constitutes radiation, so that Maxwell's views involve
 difficulties, not to say contradictions, and in places present obstacles

representation, but by the physical intuition of a mind saturated with
this aspect of the phenomena.     Many of these obstacles may,      I

be removed by beginning at the other end, by explaining electric
actions on the basis of a mechanical theory of radiation, instead of
radiation on the basis of electric actions.    The strong point of Max
well's theory is the electromotive part, which gives an account of
electric radiation and of the phenomena of electromagnetic induction
in fixed conductors ; and this is in keeping with the remark just
made.     The nature of electric displacement, of electric and magnetic
forces on matter, of what Maxwell calls the electrostatic and the
magnetic stress in the medium, of electrochemical phenomena, are
all left obscure.
   "We shall plunge into the subject at once from the optical side, if
we assume that dielectric polarisation consists in a strain in the aether,
of the rotational character contemplated above.       The conditions of
internal equilibrium of a medium so strained are easily worked out
from MacCullagh's expression for W, its potential energy.          If the
vector (J, g, h) denote the curl or vorticity of the actual linear dis
placement of the medium, or twice the absolute rotation of the portion
of the medium at the point considered, and the medium is supposed
of crystalline quality and referred to its principal axes, so that
                          W = iJ(a'/*+6y+<W)dT,
where dt is an element of volume,       it follows easily that for internal
equilibrium we must have
                         a'f dx + Vg dy + c'h dz= —dV,
a complete    differential, and that over any boundary enclosing a region
devoid of elasticity the value of V must be constant.     Such a boundary
is the surface of a conductor ; V is the electric potential in the field
due to charges on the conductors ; (/, g, h) is the electric displace
ment in the field, circuital by its very nature as a rotation, and
(a2/, b2g, c'h) is the electric force derived from the electric potential V.
The charge on a conductor is the integral of (J, g, A) over any
surface enclosing   it,   and cannot be altered except by opening up      a
channel devoid of elasticity, in the medium, between this conductor
and some other one in other words, electric discharge can take place
                     ;
only by rupture of the elastic quality of the »thereal medium.
   [At the interface between two dielectric media, taken to be crystal
line as above, the condition comes out to be that the tangential
electric force is     continuous. When the circumstances are those of
equilibrium,    and  therefore an electric potential may be introduced, this
condition allows discontinuity in the value of the potential in crossing

 1893.]          the Electric and Luminiferous Medium.                447
the interface, but demands that the amount of this discontinuity shall
be the same all along the interface ; these are precisely the circnm-
otances of the observed     phenomena of voltaic potential differences.
The component, normal to the interface, of the electric displacement
is of course always continuous, from the nature of that vector as a
flux.
   It may present itself as a difficulty in this theory that, as the elec
tric displacement is the rotational displacement of the medium, its
surface integral over any sheet should be equal to the line integral
of the linear displacement of the medium round the edge of the
sheet ; therefore that for a closed sheet surrounding a conductor this
integral should be null, which would involve the consequence that the
electric charge on a conductor cannot be different from null.        This
line of argument, however, implies that the linear displacement is a
perfectly coDtinuous one, which is concomitant with and required by
the electric displacement.       The legitimate inference is that the
electric displacement in the medium which corresponds to an actual
charge cannot be set up without some kind of discontinuity or slip in
the linear displacement of the medium ; in other words, that a con
ductor cannot receive an electric charge without rupture of the
surrounding medium ; nor can it lose a charge once l'eceived without
a similar rupture.     The part of the linear displacement that remains,
after this slip or rupture has been deducted from it, is of elastic
origin, and must satisfy the equations of equilibrium of the medium.
—December     7, 1893.]
   We can produce in imagination a steady electric current, without
introducing the complication of galvanic batteries, in the following
manner, and thus examine in detail all that is involved, on the present
theory, in the notion of a current. Suppose we have two charged
condensers, with one pair of coatings connected by a narrow conduct
ing channel, and the other pair connected by another such channel,
as in the annexed diagram, where the dark regions are dielectric and
 the white regions conducting. If we steadily move towards each
other the two plates of the condenser A, a current will flow round the
circuit, in the form of a conduction current in the conductors and a
displacement current across the dielectric plates of the condensers.
 Let us suppose the thicknesses of these dielectric plates to be exces
sively small, so as to minimise the importance of the displacement
 part of the current.    There is then practically no electric force, and
 therefore no electric displacement, in the surrounding dielectric field,
except between the plates of the condensers and close to the conduct
ing wires.    Consider a closed surface passing between the faces of
 the condenser A, and intersecting the wire at a place P. A movement
of the faces of this condenser alters the electric force between them,
and therefore alters the electric displacement across the portion of

this closed surface which lies in that part of the field ; as we have
seen there is practically no displacement, anywhere else in the field
except at the conducting wire ; therefore to preserve the law of the
circuital character of displacement throughout the whole space, we
must suppose that this alteration is compensated by a very intense
change of displacement at the conducting wire. So long as the move
ment of the plates continues, as loDg does this flow of displacement
along the wire go on ; it constitutes the electric current in the wire.
Now, in calculating the magnetic force in the field, which is the
velocity of the ethereal medium, from the change of electric displace
ment, we must include in our integration the effect of this sheet of
electric displacement flowing along the surface of the perfectly con
ducting wires, for exactly the same reason as in the correlative
problem in hydrodynamics, of calculating the velocity of the fluid
from the distribution of vorticity in it, Helmholtz had to consider a
vortex sheet as existing over each surface across which the motion
is discontinuous.
   The next stage in this mode of elucidation of electrical phenomena
is to suppose, once the current is started in our non-dissipative
circuit, that both the condensers are instantaneously removed, and
replaced by continuity of the wire.          We are now left with a current
circulating round a complete perfectly conducting channel, which in
 the absence of viscous forces will flow round permanently.                  The ex
 pression  for the  kinetic  energy  in  the   field  is easily    transformed  from
 a volume integral of the magnetic force, which is represented by

   which is sufficiently general to cover the whole ground of electro
   dynamics.
      Our result is in fact that a linear current is a vortex ring in the
   fluid tether, that electric current is represented by vorticity in the
   medium, and magnetic force by the velocity of the medium.                The
   current being carried by a perfect conductor, the corresponding
  vortex is (as yet) without a core, i.e., it circulates ronnd a vacuous
  space.    [The strength of a vortex ring is, however, permanently con
  stant ; therefore, owing to the mechanical connexions and continuity
  of the medium, a current flowing round a complete perfectly conduct
  ing circuit would be unaffected in value by electric forces induced in
  the circuit, and would remain constant throughout all time. Ordinary
  slectric currents must therefore be held to flow in incomplete conduct
  ing circuits, and to be completed either by convection across an
  electrolyte or by electric displacement or discharge across the inter
  vals between the molecules, after the manner of the illustration given
  above. — December 7, 1893.]
     Now we are here driven upon Ampere's theory of magnetism.
  Each vortex-atom in the medium is a permanent non-dissipative
 electric current of this kind, and we are in a position to appreciate
 the importance which Faraday attached to his discovery that all
 matter is magnetic.        Indeed, on consideration, no other view than
 this seems tenable ; for we can hardly suppose that so prominent a
 quality of iron as its magnetism completely disappears above the
 temperature of recalescence, to reappear again immediately the iron
 comes below that temperature ; much the more reasonable view is
 that the molecular rearrangement that takes place at that temperature
 simply masks the permanent magnetic quality. In all substances
 other than the magnetic metals, the vortex atoms pair into molecules
 and molecular aggregates in such way as to a large extent cancel each
 other's magnetic fields ; why in iron at ordinary temperatures the
 molecular aggregates form so striking an exception to the general rule
is for some reason peculiar to the substance, which, considering the
complex character of molecular aggregation in solids, need not excite
surprise.
     We have now to consider the cause of the pairing together of atoms
into molecules.      It cannot be on account of the magnetic, i.e., hydro-
dynamical, forces they exert on one another, for two electric currents
would then come together so as always to reinforce each other's mag
netic action, and all substances would be strongly magnetic.               The

450            Mr.  J.  Larmor.    A   Dynamical Theory of         [Dec. 7,
exist on the atom, supplies the attracting agency.        Furthermore, the
law of attraction between these charges is      that, of the inverse square
of the distance, and between the atomic currents is that of the inverse
cube ; so that, as in the equilibrium state of the molecule these forces
are of tbe same order of intensity and counteract each other, the first
force must have much the longer range, and the energy of chemical
•combination must therefore be very largely electrostatic, due to the
attraction of the ions, as von Helmholtz has clearly made out from
the phenomena of electrolysis and electrolytic polarisation.
   But in this discussion of the phenomena of chemical combination
of atoms we have been anticipating somewhat.           All our conclusions,
hitherto, relate to the nether, and are therefore about electromotive
forces.   We have not yet made out why two sets of molecular aggre
gates, such as constitute material bodies, should attract or repel each
other when they are charged, or when electric currents circulate in
them ; we have, in other words, now to explain the electrostatic and
electrodynamic forces which act between material systems.
    Consider two charged conductors in the field ; for simplicity, let
their conducting quality be perfect as regards the very slow displace
ments of them which are contemplated             in this argument. The
charges will then always reside on their surfaces, and the state of the
electric field will, at each instant, be one of equilibrium.    The magni
tude of the charge on either conductor cannot alter by any action
short of a rupture in the elastic quality in the rether; but the
result of movement of the conductors is to cause a re-arrange
ment of the charge on each conductor, and of the electric displace
ment (/, g, h) in the field. Now the electric energy W of the system
is altered by the movement of the conductors, and no viscous forces
are in action ; therefore the energy that is lost to the electric field
must have been somehow spent in doing mechanical work on the
conductors ; the loss of potential energy of the electric field reappears
as a gain of potential energy of the conductors.       We have to consider
how this transformation is brought about. The movement of the con
 ductors involves, while it lasts, a very intense ideal flow of electric dis
placement along their surfaces, and also a real change of displacement
 of ordinary intensity throughout the dielectric. The intense surface
 flow is in close proximity with the electric flows round the vortex
 atoms which lie at the surface ; their interaction produces a very in
 tense elastic disturbance in the medium, close at the surface of the
 conductor, which is distributed by radiation through the dielectric
 as fast as it is produced ; the elastic condition of the dielectric, on
 account of its extreme rapidity of propagation of disturbances com
 pared with its finite extent, being always extremely nearly one of
 equilibrium.   It is, I believe, the reaction on the conductor of these
 wavelets which are continually shooting out from its surface, carry

1893.]          the   Electric and Luminiferous Medium.                 451
ing energy into the dielectric, that constitutes the mechanical forcive
acting on it. But we can go further than this ; the locality of this
transformation of energy, so far at any rate as regards the material
forcive, is the surface of the conductor ; and the gain of mechanical
energy by the conductor is therefore correctly located as an absorp
tion of energy at.its surface ; therefore the forcive acting on the con
ductor is correctly determined as a surface traction, and not a bodily
forcive throughout its volume.      One mode of representing the dis
tribution of this surface traction, which, as we know, gives the correct
amount of work for every possible kind of virtual displacement of the
surface, is to consider it in the ordinary electrostatic manner as a
normal traction due to the action of the electric force on the electric
density at the surface ; we conclude that this distribution of traction
is the actual one.    To recapitulate : if the dielectric did not transmit
disturbance so rapidly, the result of the commotion at the surface
produced by the motion of the conductor would be to continually
start wavelets which would travel into the dielectric, carrying energy
 with them. But the very great velocity of propagation effectually
 prevents the elastic quality of the medium from getting hold ; no
sensible wave is produced and no flow of energy occurs into the di
electric.   The distribution of pressure in the medium which would
be the accompaniment     of the wave motion still persists, though it now
does no work in the dielectric ; it is this pressure of the medium
against the conductor that is the cause of the mechanical forcive.
   The matter is precisely illustrated by the fundamental aperpu of
 Sir George Stokes with regard to the communication of vibrations to
the air or other gas.    The rapid vibrations of a tuning-fork are com
municated as sound waves, but much less completely to a mobile
medium like hydrogen than to air.          The slow vibrations of a pen
dulum are not communicated as sound waves at all ; the vibrating
body cannot get a hold on the elasticity of the medium, which retreats
before   it,
           preserving the equilibrium condition appropriate to the con
figuration at the instant there
                          ;        isa pressure between them, but this
is instantaneously equalised throughout the medium as       it   isproduced,
without leading to any flow of vibrational energy.
   Now let us formally consider the dynamical system consisting of
the dielectric media alone, and having      boundary just inside the sur
                                            a

                                       is
of internal equilibrium or steady motion, that      is conditioned at each
instant by the position and motion of the boundaries.            The kinetic
energy   T  of the medium  is the electrodynamic energy    of  the  currents,

ductors on the medium, at its boundaries aforesaid.            The form of
the general dynamical variational equation        that   is suitable to this
problem is
                                                dS =
                        h\(T-TN) dt+\dt\cw            0,
¦where   Sw  dS represents the work done by the tractions acting on the
element dS of the boundary, in the virtual displacement contem
plated.     If there are electromotive sources in certain circuits of the
system, which are considered to introduce energy into it from outside
itself, the right-hand side of this equation must also contain an
expression for the work done by them in the virtual displacement con
templated of the electric coordinates.       Now this variational equation
can be expressed in terms of any generalised coordinates whatever,
that are sufficient to determine the configuration in accordance with
what we know of its properties.           If we suppose such a mode of
expression adopted, then, on conducting the variation in the usual
manner and equating the coefficients of each arbitrary variation of a
coordinate, we obtain the formulas
                             ~_jJdT_dT
                                              dW

In these equations * is a component of the mechanical forcive exerted
on our dielectric system by the conductors, as specified by the rule
 that the work done by it in a displacement of the system represented
 by 60, a variation of a single coordinate, is <M0: the corresponding
 component of the forcive exerted by the dielectric system on the con
 ductor is of course — <J>. Also E is the electromotive force which ads
f rom outside the system in a circuit in which the electric displace
 ment is e, so that the current in it is e ; the electromotive force in
 duced in this circuit by the dielectric system is — E.
    These equations involve the whole of the phenomena of ordinary
 electrodynamic     actions, whether ponderomotive        or electromotive,
 whether the conductors are fixed or in motion through the medium :
 in fact, in the latter respect no distinction appears between the cases.
 They will be completed presently by taking account of the dissipa
 tion which occurs in ordinary conductors.
    These equations also involve the expressions for the electrostatic
 ponderomotive forces, the genesis of which we have already attempted
 to trace in detail.    The generalised component, corresponding to the
 co-ordinate 0, of the electrostatic traction of the conductors on the
 dielectric system, is dWjd<p ; therefore the component of the traction,

   The stress in the aether between two electrified bodies consists of a
tangential traction on each element of area, equal in magnitude to
the tangential component of the electric force at that place, and at
right angles to its direction. The stress in the material of the
dielectric is such as is produced in the ordinary manner by the
surface tractions exerted on thejnaterial by the conductors that are
imbedded in it. The stress in the dielectric of Faraday and Maxwell
has no real existence ; it is in fact such a stress as would be felt by
the surface of a conductor used to explore the field, when the con
ductor is so formed and placed as not to disturb the electric force in
the dielectric. The magnetic stress of Maxwell is simply a mathe
matical mode of expression of the kinetic reaction of the medium.
   The transfer of a charged body across the field with velocity not
large compared with the velocity of electric propagation carries with
it the whole system of electric displacement belonging to the body,
and therefore produces while it lasts a system of displacement currents
in the medium, of which the circuits are completed by the actual
flow of charge along the lines of motion of the different charged
elements of the body.
   The phenomena of the electrostatic polarisation of dielectrics were
at one time provisionally represented            by Faraday as due to the
orientation of electric polar elements of the medium by the electric
force, just as magnetisation is actually due to the orientation of the
magnetic polar elements by the magnetic force of the field ; and this
theory was developed at length by Mossotti. At a later period
Maxwell himself (' Dynamical Theory,' § 11) compared the electric
displacement in a dielectric medium to an actual displacement of the
electric charge on conducting molecules imbedded in it — a conception
mathematically equivalent to the above. In a previous paper*                  I have
explained by simple reasoning       that  this view    is inconsistent     with   the
circuital character of the electric current, a conclusion in agreement
with that of von Helmholtz, who adopted this idea in his generalised
theory of electrodynamics.         It is therefore necessary to obtain a
complete    view  of   this  matter   from our present standpoint.               The
polarised molecule, with its positive and negative ions, is as we have
seen a reality ; but if the current is to remain circuital, the action of
the electric force of the field must not affect the actions between the
constituent vortices which are the cause of their orientation, nor
the distribution of the electric charges on the atoms, so much as to
produce any sensible electric displacement of this kind. These re
strictions might be secured by taking the two poles of the molecule

 sufficiently close together, and by taking the dimensions of the con
 ducting atom sufficiently small.
    As regards the second of these hypotheses, it is to be observed that
 the moment of electric induction in a conducting atom depends only
 on its size, and not on the intensity of its free electrification ; for the
 case of conducting spherules the electric moment produced by the
 action of an electric force P is 3F/4?r multiplied by the total volume
 of the atoms, and this would give a dielectric inductive coefficient
 equal to three times the ratio of the aggregate volume of the atoms
 to the whole volume of the region, a result which is, in any case, far
 too small to represent the facts, and may easily be so small as to be
 quite negligible, so as to leave the current practically circuital.
   But if we add on to this the first assumption, no room will be
left for the explanation of the pyro-electricity and piezo-electricity
of crystalline media, by changes of orientation of polar molecules
due to changes of temperature or to applied pressure.              If this very
rational explanation is to be retained, we are driven to assume that
the electric force of the field does not sensibly alter the orientation
of a molecule, which would then be wholly controlled by the internal
electrical, chemical, and cohesive forces of the medium. The state
of matters thus required is, in fact, precisely realised by a symme
trical arrangement of positive and negativo atoms in the molecule,
snch as the hexagonal molecule recently imagined by Lord Kelvin,*
and earlier by J. and P. Curie, to account for the piezo-electric quality
of quartz ; the symmetry of the electric charges makes null the
aggregate electric moment and therefore the turning couple in an
electric field, while a differential polarity can still be developed under
strain of the crystal.
   According to the present theory of electrification, a discharge of
electricity from one conductor to another can only occur by the break
ing down of the elasticity of the dielectric aether along some channel
connecting them ; and a similar rupture is required to explain the
transfer of an atomic charge to the electrode in the phenomenon of
electrolysis.    We can conceive the polarisation increasing by the
accumulation of dissociated ions at the two electrodes of a voltameter,
until the stress in the portion of the medium between the ions and
the conducting plate breaks down, and a path of discharge is opened
from some ion to the plate. While this ion retained its charge, it
repelled its neighbours ; but now electric attraction will ensue, and
the one that gets into chemical contact with it first will be paired
with it by the chemical forces ; while if the conducting path to the
electrode remains open until this union is complete, the ion will
receive an opposite atomic charge from the electrode, which very con
ceivably may have to be also of equal amount, in order to equalise

 the potentials of the molecule and the plate.      This is on the hypo
 thesis that the distance between     the two ions of a molecule is very-
 small compared with the distance between two neighbouring mole
 cules.    A view of this kind, if thoroughly established, would lead to
 the  nltimate averaging of atomic charges of all atoms that have been
 in combination with each other, even if those charges had been
 originally of different magnitudes.      [The assignment of free electric
 charges to vortex atoms tends markedly in the direction of insta
 bility ; though instability under certain circumstances is essential to
 electric discharge, yet it must not be allowed to become dominant. —
 December     7, 1893.]
    The presence of vortex atoms, forming faults so to speak in the
 tether,  will clearly diminish its effective rotational elasticity ; and
 thus it is to be expected that the specific inductive capacities of
 material dielectrics should be greater than the inductive capacity of
 a vacuum.       The readiness with which electrolytic media break down
 under electric stress may be connected with the extremely high values
 of their inductive capacities, indicating very great yielding to even
 a small electric force.
    The radiation of a body into the surrounding medium is wholly
 electrical, and is due to the electric vibrations of the atomic charges ;
some of these types of vibration may correspond to the single atom
by itself, while others will be considerably affected by the presence
of the neighbouring atoms of the molecule.         The most striking fact
to be explained is the total independence of temperature that is
exhibited by the periodic times corresponding to the various spectral
lines.    The extreme smallness of an atom implies correspondingly
intense electrification, and therefore independence of the external
field.    If it is assumed that the dimensions and configuration of the
atom are determined by the very intense actions between it and its
partners in the molecule, and are not sensibly affected by the com
paratively feeble influence of the velocity of translation of the mole
cule through the medium, this fact will be accounted for ; irregu
larities can then only occur during an encounter with another mole
cule.
   In the hydrodynamics of ordinary liquids,       when the energy of an
isolated    vortex ring is increased,   the ring  expands in radius, and
therefore moves onward more slowly.         But in the case of an isolated
charged atom, an expansion          in radius diminishes the potential
energy of the electric charge.       These two agencies counteract each
other ; if the latter one is the greater, increase in energy will involve
increase in velocity, as would be required iu the ordinary form of the
kinetic theory of gases. But the more natural supposition is, per
haps, to consider a molecule as composed of atoms paired so that the
velocity of translation does not depend intrinsically on the amount

of energy associated with the molecule, but is determined by the cir
cumstances of the encounters -with other molecules.        The distribution
of energy between the various vibration-types of the molecule, accord
ing to the law of Maxwell and Boltzmann, will not affect its con
figuration, while there is also perfect independence between the
hydrodynamical motion of the medium due to the molecule and the
radiation produced by it.
   As regards the rotational elasticity of this hydrodynamical aether,
on which we have made all radiative and electrical phenomena
depend, it was objected, in 1862, by Sir George Stokes* to Mac-
 Cullagh's aather, that a medium of that kind would leave unbalanced
the tangential surface-tractions on an element of volume, and there
fore could not be in internal equilibrium ; and this objection has
usually been recognised, and has practically led to MacCullagh's
theory of light being put aside, at any rate in this country. Now, it
has been already mentioned that a precisely equivalent objection will
apply to the elasticity actually produced by a gyrostatic distribution
of momentum in an ordinary solid medium, the only difference in
the circumstances being that in the latter case the rotational elas
ticity is proportional to the angular velocity and not to the angular
displacement ;t and this remark suggests that there must be some
way out of the difficulty. If we consider the laws of motion, stated
in Newton's manner with reference to absolute space and absolute
time, as fundamental principles, then it is also a fundamental prin
ciple that the energy of a spinning gyrostat has reference to absolute
space, and is not relative to the material system which contains it.
 The gyrostat may be considered as a kind of connexion binding that
system to absolute immovable space by means of the forcive which it
opposes to rotation ; and this is the reason why the element of mass
in a gyrostatic medium remains in equilibrium with its translational
kinetic reactions, although the tractions of the surrounding parts on
its surface are unbalanced and result in a couple.         If this mode of
viewing the subject is regarded     as   incongruous, then we must discard
from dynamics the notion of absolute space, and we must set out in
quest of some transcendental explanation of the directional forcives
in rotational systems. In any case the general Lagrangian dynamical
procedure applies precisely to the gyrostatic medium we have here
taken as an illustration : nor, probably, would its application to
MacCullagh's aether be questioned, once ihe preliminary objection
was removed.

   This question may also be instructively illustrated from another
side, by the consideration of an actual medium which                 possesses
precisely the rotational elasticity of MacCullagh's aether.      Iallude to
 a solid medium with small magnets interspersed through it in any
 arbitrary manner, but so that in any single element of volume there
 is some regularity in their orientation.     If this medium when un
strained is in equilibrium in a magnetic field, then when an element
 of it is displaced rotationally it will be acted on by a bodily couple
 arising from this external field ; and therefore the surface tractions
 on the element would, in the presence of this couple, be unbalanced.
 Here the disturbing cause is a magnetic forcive arising either from
 the medium as a whole or from some external system ; it has to be
considered as of a statical character, that      is,
                                                 the velocity of propaga
tion of the magnetic action       is supposed    to be indefinitely great
compared with the velocity of propagation of any disturbances that
are under discussion the magnetic influence of the whole system

supposed to be instantaneously brought to bear on the element, and
not merely the influence of the surrounding parts.        On this saving
hypothesis, the magnetic energy        here also correctly localised, for
                                       is
dynamical purposes, in the element of volume of the medium, and
the Lagrangian method has perfect application to the mathematical
analysis of its phenomena.
    Now, in the case of the aether we have at hand a vera catua
precisely of this kind. The cause of the phenomena of gravitation
has hitherto remained perfectly inscrutable.         Though the present
order of ideas forbids us to consider      otherwise than as propagated
                                            it
in time, yet all we know of its velocity of propagation     is the demon
stration by Laplace that   itmust, at the very least, exceed the velocity
of propagation of light in the same kind of proportion as the latter
velocity exceeds that of ordinary motions of matter.        It   isnot un-
philosophical to assume that an explanation of gravitation might
carry along with it the explanation of the fact that the tangential
tractions on an element of the strained aether are unbalanced.         The
dynamical phenomena of mass in matter would appear to be ana
lytically explicable by the addition of a rotational part to the kinetic
energy of the element of the medium       such a term
                                            ;          is  of course prac
tically null except in the vortex rings.
    In all that has been hitherto said we have kept clear of the com
plication of viscous forces ;   but in order to extend our account to
the phenomena of opacity in the theory of radiation and of electric
currents in ordinary conductors,        is necessary to introduce such
                                       it
forces  and  make   what we can of them on general principles.        It    is
shown that the introduction of the dissipatioo function into dynamics
by Lord Rayleigh enables us to amend the statement of the funda
mental dynamical principle, the law of Least Action, so as to include

458               Mr.   J. Larmor,      A   Dynamical    Theory   of       [Dec. 7,
in it the very extensive class of viscous forces which are proportional
to absolute or relative velocities of parts of the system.               This class
is the more important because it is the only one that will allow a
simple wave to be propagated through a medium with period inde
pendent of its amplitude ; if the viscous forces that act in light pro
pagation were not of this kind, then on passing a beam of homo
geneous light through a metallic film it should emerge as a mixture
of lights of different colours.         The viscous forces being thus proved
by   the   phenomena of radiation to be derived from a dissipation func
tion, it is natural to extend the same conclusion to the elastic
motions of slower periods than radiations, which constitute ordinary
electric disturbances.         We thus arrive, by way of an -optical path, at
Joule's law of dissipation of electric energy, and Ohm's linear law of
electric conduction, and the whole theory of the electrodynamics of
currents flowing in ordinary conductors ; though the presumption is
that the coefficients which apply to motions of long period are not
the same as those which apply to very rapid oscillations, the
characters of the matter-vibrations that are comparable in the two
cases being quite different.* If it is assumed that the form of the dis
sipation function is the same for high frequencies as for low ones,
we obtain the ordinary theory of metallic reflexion, which differs
from the theory of reflexion at a transparent medium simply by
taking the refractive index to be a complex quantity, as was done
originally by Cauchy, and later for the most general case by
MacCullagh.          And, in fact, we could not make a more general sup
position    than   this  for the case of isotropic media ; while for crystal
line media the utmost generality would arise merely from assuming1
the principal axes of the dissipation function to be different from
those of the rotational elasticity, a hypothesis which is not likely to
 be  required.
    It  has been pointed out, originally by Lord Rayleigh, that to fit
this theory to the facts of metallic reflexion it is necessary to take
the real part of the index of refraction of the metals to be a negative
quantity, which can hardly be allowed on other grounds, as it would
imply instability of the medium. We might indeed, following the
view of Willard Gibbs and others, imagine an interaction between
the light wave and the free vibrations of the atomic electric charges,
and through them the chemical vibrations of the atoms, owing to
proximity of their periods ; and we might possibly conceive the
electric medium to be, so to speak, held together by this kind of
support.       But I think there is another and simpler alternative that
   *  It is interesting to notice that, already in his memoir of 1864, Maxwell is
 struck by the identity of tho coefficients of the free tether for all periods, which
" shows how perfect and regular the elastic properties of the medium must be when
not encumbered with any matter denser than air."

merits examination ; we might conceive the opacity at the surface
to be so great that a sensible part of the light is lost before it has
penetrated more than a very small fraction of a wave-length.                       In the
extreme case of        electric  waves    of   finite length reflected from metals,
the absorption is complete in a very small fraction of the wave
length, and the result is total reflexion, as from a vacuum ; on the
other hand, if the opacity is but slight, the phenomena ought to
agree approximately with those of transparent media.                            It seems
worth while to examine the consequences of assuming that the optical
phenomena of metallic reflexion are nearer the first of these limiting
cases than the second.           It seems worth while also to compare the
facts for some medium not so opaque as metals with the formulae of
Cauchy and MacCullagh ; the examples of tourmaline crystal, and
some of the aniline dyes which exhibit selective absorption, suggest
themselves as affording crucial tests.*
    The considerations which have here been explained amount to an
attempt to extend the regions of contact between three ultimate
theories which have all been already widely developed, but in such a
way as not to have much connexion with one another.                                 These
theories are Maxwell's theory of electric phenomena,                           including
Ampere's theory of magnetism and involving an electric theory of
light, Lord Kelvin's vortex-atom theory of matter, and the purely
dynamical theories of light and radiation that have been proposed by
Green, MacCullagh, and other authors. It is hoped that a sufficient
basis of connexion between them has been made out, to justify a re
statement of the whole theory of the kind here attempted, notwith
standing such errors or misconceptions on points of detail as will
unavoidably be involved in it.
    [While writing this summary it had escaped my memory that Lord
Kelvin has proposed a gyrostatic adynamic medium which forms an
exact representation         of a rotationally elastic medium such as has
been here described.t If the spinning bodies are imbedded in the
sether so as to partake fully in its motion, the rotational forcive due
to them is proportional jointly to the angular momentum of a gyro
stat and the angular velocity of the element of the medium, in accord
ance with what is stated above.                But if we consider the rotators to
be free gyrostats of the Foucault type, mounted on gymbals of which
the outer frame is carried by the medium, there will also come into play
a steady rotatory forcive, proportional jointly to the square of the an-
   *       alternative view, in many respects preferable, is supplied by the assumption

  gular momentum         of the gyrostat and to the absolute angular dis
 placement of the medium.         An ideal gyrostatic cell has been imagined
  by Lord Kelvin in which the coexistence of pairs of gyrostats spin
 ning on parallel axles in opposite directions cancels the first of these
 forcives, thus leaving only a static forcive of a purely elastic rota
  tional type. The conception of an sether which is sketched by him on
  this basis* is essentially the same as the one we have here employed,
 with the exception that the elemental angular velocity of the medium
 is taken to represent magnetic force, and in consequence the medium
 fails to give an accounb of electric force and its static and kinetic
 manifestations. A gyrostatic cell of this kind has internal freedom,
 and therefore free vibration periods of its own ; it is necessary to
 imagine that these periods are very small compared with the periods
 of the light waves transmitted through the medium, in order to avoid
 partial absorption. The propagation of waves in this sether, having
 periods of the same order as the periods of these free vibrations,
would of course be a phenomenon of an altogether different kind, in
volving diffusion through the medium of energy of disturbed motion
of the gyrostats within the cells.
      Lord Kelvin has shown that a fluid medium, in turbulent motion
owing to vorticity distributed throughout it, would also possess rota
tional elasticity provided we could be assured of its permanence.
 Professor G. F. Fitzgerald proposes to realise such a medium by
 means of a distribution of continuous vortex filaments, interlacing in
all directions ; if the vorticities of the filaments in an element of
volume are directed indifferently in all directions, the motional part
of the kinetic forcive on the element, which depends on the first
power of the vorticity, will be null, while the positional part depend
ing on the square of the vorticity will remain, just as in the gyrostatic
medium above considered.          The atoms may now be imagined to con
sist of vortex rings making their way among these vortex filaments,
and thus a very graphic and suggestive scheme is obtained; the
question of stability is however here all-important.                 No ultimate
theory can be      final ; and schemes   of  the  kind   discussed   in  this paper
may not inaptly be compared to structural formulae in modern
chemistry; they bind together phenomena that would otherwise
have to be taken as disconnected, though they are themselves pro
visional and may in time be replaced by more perfect representations.

I. " On the Constitution and            Mode    of Formation of Food
     Vacuoles in Infusoria, as illustrated by the History of the
     Processes of Digestion in Carchesium polypinum" By Marion
     Greenwood, Girton College, Cambridge.                 Communicated
     by J. N. Langley, F.R.S. Received October 28, 18y3.
                                 (Abstract.)
   Since   the   time  that Ehrenberg first formulated his celebrated
" polygastric " theory, there have been few writers on the Infusoria
who have not confirmed his observations while combating the inter
pretation of them given by him.       For it was shown long ago that the
" Magenzellen
                  " of
                        Ehrenberg  are  spherical food masses, and these,
circulating   with  varying rapidity in  the " endoplasm," are so striking
optically in most Infusoria that the literature of this group abounds
in descriptions of or references to them.      There is, however, a lack of
any details which would throw light on the precise mode of origin of
these ingesta, and yet this point has interest, for, while relatively
large food masses are swallowed by certain of the ciliate Infusoria,
very many forms are adapted only for the inception of minute solid
particles, which seem far removed from the relatively large masses
so noticeable within the animals.
   An extreme case of this disparity between the size of ingested
particles and the size of food masses circulating within the body is
found in almost any member of the Vorticellidro ; the form          I have
chosen for examination is Carchesium polypinum, which grows in
pedicellate clusters, each polype being mounted on a highly retractile

 1893.]     Mode   of Formation of Food       Vacuoles in    Infusoria.       467
 stalk, and being made np of relatively transparent cell substance.
 This animal shows such marked voracity upon occasion that I have
counted 100 food masses within its substance ; at the same time it is
only minute particles which are acceptable when offered for ingestion.
 The shaping of the one form of matter from the other, then, promises
to be a process of no small interest, and actual observation has made
 me think that it is more than merely interesting, that it may be re
 garded rather as the striking illustration of a process often mashed in
other Protozoa, but fundamental in nature.
    I  have fed Carchesium with nutritious        and innutritions particles,
with milk, with bacteria, with such flocculent precipitates as aro
thrown down by the interaction of ditch water and alizarin sulphate
or congo-red, and with pigment grains— carmine, Indian ink, or
ultramarine blue. All these are ingested readily, but the particles
which perhaps serve best to illustrate the striking events of diges
tion are the finely- divided granules of proteid which form a precipi
tate when diluted white of egg is coagulated by heat.                  When the
white of fresh eggs      is treated  thus, the heat    precipitate  is  generally
abundant ; a very scanty coagulum may form, however, when the eggs
from which the diluted fluid is prepared are stale. It is known that
any marked alkalinity hinders effective coagulation of albumen and
that albumoses and peptones do appear in stale white of egg; I
think it fair, then, to suppose that Carchesium, ingesting the abundant
coagulation precipitate is ingesting minute irregular fragments of
nutritious matter suspended in a dilute solution of salts, and that in
administering the merely opalescent fluid a less obvious but possibly
important substance is supplied — soluble food. All ingested particles,
whatever their nature, pass from the exterior by a slightly sinuous
ciliated pharyngeal tube which leads inwards from the wide mouth,
and, spacious itself at first, narrows, to end internally in a small
dilated sac, the cesophagns.*        An anal ridge runs at right angles to
the long axis of the polype at the junction of the outer and middle
thirds of the pharynx, and from this ridge all effete matters are
ejected, but food particles are gathered by the oral and pharyngeal
cilia into the oesophageal sac, and, mixed in varying proportions with
the fluid medium in which the animal is living, start from its most
internal point on their intracellular career as a vacuole of ingestion.
   Each vacuole of ingestion thus discharged by some obscure im
pulse performs a movement of progression ; it passes with a steady
gliding motion towards the basal attachment of the polype, coming
to rest at some point along the concavity of the band-like nucleus.
A period of quiescence follows and persists in healthy specimens for
some seconds, and at its end the vacuolar contents, which up to this
   •  I hare adopted the terminology of B. Qreef (' Archiv fur Naturgesch.,' Wieg-
mann, vol. 37, 1871).

 468        Miss M. Greenwood.               On   the   Constitution and          [Dec. 14,
 point have been apparently in the condition in which they left the
'oesophagus, are rearranged in a very remarkable fashion.                          The solid
 particles, it may be of proteid, of pigment, or bacteria, are gathered to a
 cluster, with a rapid centripetal movement ; those which are more peri
 pheral   leave the boundaries      of the vacuole, and a composite solid mass lies
 in clear fluid surroundings.          The outline of constituents so strikingly
 individual as are bacteria or the fat globules of milk may still be
 made out in the cohering cluster, but Brownian movement is ended, as
 are the " proper movements of any small organisms which may be
                       "
 present, and further change is not in the direction of freedom, but makes
 the union closer ; it tends to perfect the homogeneity of the composite
 solid. To this rearrangement of matter I apply the term " aggrega
 tion,"* for the obvious feature of the act is the clustering of particles
 of matter which were scattered before. It is most clearly demonstrable
 in vacuoles which contain but few minute particles suspended in a
 relatively large amount of water ; it is masked when the solid matter
 preponderates or is less finely divided.                No distinct relation can be
 traced, however, between the chemical character of the ingested
 matter and energy of aggregation, for nutritious and innutritions
 particles are moved with equal vigour and show equally little ten
 dency to immediate subsequent separation.                     I might enumerate no
 inconsiderable number of variations of this process, some dependent
 on peculiarities of the ingesta dealt with (the presence of organic
 matter in solution, the rare enclosure of filamentous bacteria), some
 related rather to changes in the condition of Carchesium (abnormally
 eager ingestion or exceptionally lethargic action), but through all the
 modifications I have observed the salient characteristic of aggregation
 of solids and synchronous separation of fluid may be traced, and in
 face of each, the question arises, " What force effects this movement and
 insures this redistribution
                                                 "
                                  of matter ?
    In answer to this question, three hypotheses may                    be  considered     : —
    1. It may be supposed that as particulate proteid matter if pressed
 together with some force tends to form masses which cohere after
 the pressure is removed, so in the vacuole of ingestion the approxi
 mately symmetrical discharge of small jets of fluid from the sur
 rounding protoplasm carries solid particles centripetally, and that,
 after displacement of the water between them, they cohere.                              It is
 noticeable, however, that grains of Indian ink may be united firmly
 in aggregation and discharged as a solid mass, that relatively large
 granules (such as the fat drops of milk) are inseparable after the first
 marked centripetal shifting,^ and that nothing is more striking than
   * I use this term with   some reluctance in face of the fact that        it was applied by
 Darwin many years ago      (' Insectivorous  Plants  ') to an entirely  different  process in
 the cells of the tentacles of Drosera.
   t  It will be gathered from what has been said above that only when these

 the firm unbroken edge of a composite solid which abuts on the fluid
of the vacuole in which it was formed.               On these and other grounds
this hypothesis appears to me inadequate, and                I  would lay but little
 stress upon it.
    2. Again, it may be believed that, as in plasmolysed vegetable
 cells, the primordial utricle shrinks centripetally, gathering up in its
 retreat all granules which lie within or throughout its substance, so
 here a highly elastic pellicle, living, or the product of secretion, is set free
 from the walls of the vacuole and contracts rapidly, gathering within
its lessening circumference all the solid particles which were sus
 pended freely before.         The unbroken line, which from the moment of
 aggregation marks off the clustered particles from the fluid in which
they lie, does indeed suggest the presence of an enclosing film, but
other experimental facts are clearly out of harmony with an hypothesis
 which postulates its existence. Thus tha final cohesion of aggregated
 particles is at least as perfect in the centre of the composite mass as
 round its circnmference ; when by certain changes which may follow
Aggregation any particles are set free slowly, it is from the outside of
 the food mass only, and ejection from the body never means disinte
gration of the contents of an excretory vacuole, but is rather the
 freeing of a resistent solid. Further, there is, rarely, a want of syn
 chronism in the aggregation of the particles in a vacuole; Brownian
 movement may persist for a time towards the end of the vacuole, when
 the majority of the granules present are quiescent ; in other rare cases
the aggregated mass clings to the cell substance from which it is (for
 the most part) separated by fluid, by slender threads of almost in
visible, possibly mucilaginous, substance, these threads breaking
 presently and being dragged into the central solid ; and it is usual to
 find that actual measurement of a food mass demonstrates the per
sistence of secondary shrinking after aggregation is over.                     I  am
inclined then to think that a third hypothesis meets                  the case  more
fully than either of those just mentioned, and to suggest —
    3. That the solid particles which undergo change of position in aggre
gation are dragged together by the comparatively rapid retraction of sowi
substance contained in the vacuole ; this substance is probably viscous.
    Such an hypothesis does not, however, offer any description of the
mechanism of retraction, and the nature of this mechanism is certainly
obscure. But       I   may point out that there are some undoubted re
semblances between this rearrangement of substance and the phe
nomena which are grouped together as " clotting actions." In all
perfected clots we have to recognise the interaction of two bodies or
it may be the reconstitution of one body removed from the seat of
most vigorous metabolic change — the cell, and a separation of solid
relatirely large particles are present scantily in a vacuole do they more markedly in
aggregation.
                                                                                      /

470       Miss M. Greenwood.          On  the  Constitution and    [Dec. 14,
matter and subsequent        shrinking,   both varying in character and
extent,   are common     accompaniments       of the fundamental chemical
reaction of clotting.
   In  Carchesium, then,   it may  be  that we meet with a modification of
the process, that there is an intravacuolar discharge of matter which
clots, shrinking rapidly, and not with the slow change of casein or
fibrin, and that it, entangling any solid particles which are present,
brings about the spasm of aggregation.         The substance is, indeed, not
demonstrable usually by staining or other form of micro-chemistry,
but delicate indicators of the presence of acid introduced into a
digestive vacuole indicate that the vacuolar fluid begins to have an
acid reaction about the time when aggregation is perfected.             It is
conceivable, then, that an access of acid fluid at this point may help the
effective retraction of the clot, or even its first formation.
   When by the process of aggregation spherical ingesta have been
welded together in the substance of Carchesium from digestible or
indigestible particles, they journey through the " endoplasm " in a
fairly constant fashion, but for a variable time.          Occasionally they
are stored for hours after loss of the fluid of those vacuoles in which
aggregation occurred ; at times the digestion of nutritious matter
follows the preliminary clustering with no marked pause.                  All
nutritive ingesta present are not of necessity digested synchronously ;
indeed, there is sometimes apparent caprice in solution, but certain
features of the process are invariable whenever its onset occurs.
   Thus, as in Amoeba, solution is effected in a fluid medium.           The
stored up food masses of Carchesium,, when they have lost their
fluid surroundings, have reached the extreme point of density and
 shrinkage ; solution implies swelling, transparency, and re-formation of
 a vacuole if it has not persisted.       Digestion may take place at any
point   throughout   a  relatively  large  part of the central substance of
 Carchesium, but complete solution is extremely rare, and innutritions
 remains travel with varying rapidity towards the anal ridge from
 which they are discharged. Thus they pass into the pharynx, to be
 swept to the exterior eventually by ciliary currents. It may be said
 that, other things being equal, the intracellular sojourn of ingesta
 tends to vary directly with their digestibility ; thns clusters of aggre
 gated particles in which such bodies as carmine or Indian ink pre
 ponderate or stand alone have a relatively short time of enclosure ;
 the fluid of the vacuoles in which they are formed often disappears
 quickly, and there is but rarely (in the case of unmixed innutritions
 matter) that re-formation of fluid which is so nearly concerned in the
 solution of true food stuffs.
    I have spoken    hitherto with some vagueness         of the duration of

 1893.]     Mode  of Formation of Food    Vacuoles   in Infusoria.        471
successive events in the digestive process in Carchesium, and, indeed,
the  variability of many of them is marked.         Changing conditions of
the animal, on the one hand (and some of these changes cannot easily
be controlled by the experimenter), and alteration in surroundings
¦which may be bound up with temperature,         aeration, illumination, or
food, on the other, tend to bring out the elasticity of some of the
periods which    I  have distinguished. But this elasticity has limits,
nor does it characterise equally all the phases in the digestive cycle.
We find that the total time of enclosure of innutritious matter may
be   as short as 30 minutes, that nutritious      substances    have a mini
mum (recorded) sojourn of 1 hour to 1^ hour, and, on the other
hand, that the time of enclosure may be prolonged to 30 hours.
This great variation is found on examination to belong to that period
in the history of ingesta in which they are stored, inert and destitute
of fluid surroundings. The interval which separates successive acts
of ingestion in any one series varies from 30 sec. to 65 sec, and is
commonly 40 sec. ; the duration of the movement of progression varies
inversely (roughly speaking) with the duration of the phase of
quiescence.    Thus, progression may occupy 5^ sec. or 14$ sec, but is
often lOf sec. ; quiescence, with a usual duration of 9 sec, may be
shortened to 5 sec, or lengthened to 25£ sec. Aggregation is, as a rule,
instantaneous    in vigorous animals, but -f sec. or even -£ sec. have
passed between the onset and completion of the movement.             The act
of solution is more variable ;   I have seen very far reaching digestive
change in 50 min., but that variation should be more striking than
constancy is hardly surprising in face of the unlike nature of possibly
                                 I
digestible matter. Lastly, as have said, the stage of storage may be
 omitted ; in this case digestion succeeds aggregation at once, the
fluid of the digestive vacuole increasing in amount and (presumably)
changing in composition ; on the other hand, ingesta may be stored
for 22 hours before they are attacked by the true digestive secretion.
   I  have said   above there seem to me to be grounds         for regarding
the aggregation of ingested particles      in  this complete and vigorous
manner as a fundamental process in Protozoan digestion.              Striking
as   the   phenomenon    is in  Carchesium,   the  actual  displacement     of
matter which it involves is, of course, small, and effective demonstra
tion is possible chiefly because of the great transparency of the acting
cell substance, and because the food is naturally, or may be kept
artificially, in a state of minute division. Even in Carchesium, how
ever, the marked retractility of the hyaline stalk of each polype often
hinders observation ; and, when it is remembered that so many
Protozoa are vigorously motile, or relatively opaque, or deal (as do
the Rhizopods) with comparatively massive food, it is hardly wonder
ful that a secretion of matter which is (by virtue of its own

characters)    practically  invisible,  has   occurred without   exciting
especial   comment.    R. Greef, in the paper to which I have referred,
gives what I take to be a very brief description of the process of
^aggregation in Epistylis ftavicans, and, looking back at observations
made on the digestive processes in Amceba some time ago, I feel that
many which were puzzling then are in harmony with the experi
mental   results recorded    above.    Among these   I may instance the
very sudden quiescence after enclosure of such small organisms as
monads, the firm union of unlike ingesta which were by chance
•enclosed together and so came to be in a common vacuole, and the
cohesion after ingestion of particles of carmine or Indian ink.
    And if further work should replace these scattered points of like
ness by fuller, harmonious observations, then I think that the process
of aggregation, owing the interest which it possesses, not to the
obvious movement of particles, but to the more hidden mechanism
which carries out the movement, may be allowed to have some such
functional value as that indicated in Carchedum by the constancy of
its duration and the constancy of its occurrence, whatever the chemi
cal nature of the foreign particles involved. It may perhaps rank
as an expression of what has been lacking among the Protozoa — what
is clear enough among Ccelenterata, with their well-defined, uni
cellular glands — as an expression of obscure histological change bound
up with the digestion of food, or more nearly with its preparation for
digestion.

       Ward, D.Sc, F.R.S., Professor of Botany, Royal Indian
       Engineering College, Coopers Hill. Received December 14,

    Several   observers,   notably Arloing,     Janowsky, Geisler, and
 Chemelewsky, have tried to determine which rays of the spectrum
 are chiefly concerned in the destruction of bacteria, but all attempts
 hitherto have been made by placing separate tubes of broth, gelatine,
 or potato cultures in the various regions of the spectrum, and judg
 ing of the relative rates of growth by the periods in which turbidity
 is apparent, or by the sizes of the respective growths on solid cultures,
 and their conclusions vary considerably.
    The author has succeeded in obtaining photographic records by
 throwing the spectrum on an agar film evenly charged with the
 spores or bacilli to be investigated, and then observing the behaviour
of the illuminated regions after incubation.
    Various 6pecies have been employed, Bacillus anthracis, B. sub

tilis, a violet bacillus from the Thames, and several other Thames
bacilli being the chief.
    In all cases so far examined, both the solar and electric spectra
show that no action whatever is perceptible in the infra- red, red,
orange, or yellow region, while all are injured or destroyed in the
blue and violet regions.
    The exact point when the action begins and ends is not the same
in all the experiments, though very nearly so, but it must be reserved
for the detailed memoir to discuss the various cases.
    Broadly speaking, the action begins at the blue end of the green,
rises to a maximum as we pass to the violet end of tho blue, and
^liminishes as we proceed in the violet to the ultra-violet regions

Flo.   1. — Plate  of anthrax spores, exposed for five hours to the solar spectrum in
            August, and incubated for forty-eight hours.      The spectrum shone on
            the plate through a slot of the width shown by tho cleared portion, and
            whose length is denoted by the base line above the letters.     The letters
            mark the principal regions of the spectrum ; the vertical lines, the limits
            of these regions (not Fraunhofer's lines). Thus, those radiations we call
            infra-red, red (B), orange, and yellow affected the spores no more than
            total darkness, and colonies, therefore, germinated out in those regions as
            readily as over the main area of the plate. The same is partly true of the
            green (G) and the violet and ultra-violet regions to the right of V.    The
            maximum effect is in tho blue and blue-violet (BV), where nearly every
            spore has been destroyed, and the area appears cleared of colonies.

             The lower 9lot was covered with quartz only, the upper with a thin plate
             of glass. The base-line in each case gives length of exposed slot. In both

             ing to   see how the bactericidal action extended far into the ultra-violet
              (U V) in the  case of the lower slot, where the light passed through quartx
             only.    The  two   little protuberances over UV were due to two little over
              flows of burnt Canada balsam at the edge of the slot, cutting off light.

  yielded no results, however, and it was not until he was so fortunate as to secure
  the hearty cooperation of Professor Oliver Lodge that it was possible to accomplish
  the photographing of the electric spectra in bacteria. To Professor Lodge and
  Mr. E. Eobinson the author takes this opportunity of expressing his special thanks

lenses, Ac., were so feeble              that   it   was necessary   to employ quartz
throughout.
   Secondly, the bactericidal effect is found to extend far into the
ultra-violet.   The intervention of a thin piece of glass results in the
cutting off of a large proportion of effective rays (fig. 2).
   Thirdly, the most destructive rays —end of blue and beginning of
violet — are to some extent effective even after reflection from the
inner faces of the quartz plate covering the film and the glass on
which it is supported, and so a peculiar bellying out of the image
of the illuminated slot is observable during the early stages of incuba
tion — the figure being thus made to show its own curye of intensity
as   it   were.
   The plates employed arc ordinary agar cultures in shallow glass
dishes, covered with a glass plate in which one or more slots — about
3 ins. long by  in. wide — are pierced.

                         is
similar films containing bacteria of different species can be exposed
simultaneously to the same spectrum.
   These results suggest evidently that the naked arc light may prove
to be a very efficient disinfecting agent in hospital wards, railway
carriages, or anywhere where the rays can be projected directly on to
the organism. The author has elsewhere shown the evidence on
which      itconcluded that the action is direct and on the cell con
                is

the above conclusion would still be true in practice.
   It is extremely desirable that experiments should be made on the
action of light on living cells of animals —e.g., Infusoria, ova, <fec —
since results would probably be obtained of importance as regards sun
burn, sun-baths, and other matters.*

    This paper is the detailed record of the symptoms, temporary and
 permanent, following total and partial extirpation of the cerebellum,
 and section of its pednncles, and the degenerations so induced ; and
 inclndes the effects of destruction of the tubercles on the posterior
 surface of the medulla oblongata, and the degenerations resulting
 therefrom, together with some observations on the central relations of
 the 5th cranial nerve. The paper is illustrated by photographs taken
 direct from the microscopical sections.        Special reference is made to
 the similar researches of Luciani     and  Marchi.
    The most noteworthy features of complete extirpation of the
 cerebellum were the extraordinary disturbances of station and loco
 motion, and the long-continued and apparently persistent unsteadiness,
of the trunk and limbs on mnscular effort.            There were noted, also,
 from the first, absence of tonic flexion or contracture of the limbs -
 retention of great and, apparently, unimpaired mnscular strength, as
 evidenced by the firmness of the grasp of the bands and feet, and the
agility in climbing; and the presence, with nltimate exaggeration, of
the knee-jerks.     There was no impairment of the general or special
sensibility, or disturbance of the organic functions.
    The symptoms observed after extirpation of a lateral lobe, after the
first tumultuous disturbance of equilibrium had passed off, were
similnr to those observed after complete extirpation, with the impor
tant difference that they were confined to the limbs on the side of
lesion.    Except in one case, where it was only present to a slight
extent, there was no impulsive tendency to rotation.
    Extirpation of the middle lobe, including antero-posterior division,
produced, in general, the same symptoms as were observed in connex
ion with removal of the whole organ and of the lateral lobe, but they
did not affect one side more than the other, and were more pronounced
in the head and trunk than in the limbs.
    The symptoms following section of the cerebellar peduncles were
similar to those occurring after removal of the lateral lobe, the chief

 difference   being the greater tendency to roll round the longitudinal
 axis towards the side of lesion, whichever peduncle was cut.
    Destruction of the clavate and cuneate nuclei caused temporary dis
 turbances of attitude and gait, but there was no affection of cutaneous
 sensibility.
    The degenerations following removal of the lateral lobe of the
 cerebellum, or section of the superior peduncle, showed that this
 structure contains an efferent tract to the opposite red nucleus,
 and optic thalamus, and an afferent tract, which appears to be
 the cerebellar termination of the antero-lateral ascending tract of
 Gowers.
    Lateral lobe extirpation, or section of the middle peduncle, was
 followed by diminution of the transverse fibres of the pons Varolii on
the side of the lesion, and atrophy of the cells of the nucleus pontis.
on the opposite side.
    Lateral lobe extirpation, or section of the inferior peduncle,,
 demonstrated the existence of an efferent tract to the opposite inferior-
olivary body, and of an afferent tract to the cortex, chiefly of the lateral
lobe.
    Extirpation of the middle lobe occasioned no degeneration in the-
superior, middle, or inferior cerebellar peduncles, but was followed
by degeneration and sclerosis of the tract which passes from the
 vermiform process to Deiters' nucleus — the " direct sensory cerebellar
        "
 tract of Edinger.
    We were unable to confirm Marchi'a statements as to the existence-
of a direct efferent cerebellar tract in the spinal cord, or of degenera
tion in the anterior nerve roots, mesial fillet, or posterior longitudinal
bundles, after cerebellar extirpation.
    In two cases of lateral lobe extirpation, however, we obtained de
generation in the anterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord
respectively, in the position indicated by Marchi.     In the case, how
ever, in which there was a marginal degeneration          in the anterior
column, the nucleus of Deiters, on the same side, was implicated ;
while, in that in which degeneration in the lateral column was.
present, there was a lesion of the tegment of the pons, involving the
nucleus of the lateral fillet. The same degeneration was induced by
lesions specially made in the lateral fillet.
    Destruction of the clavate and cuneate nuclei was followed by de
generation, on the one hand, through the restiform body into th&
cerebellum ; and, on the other hand, through the internal and middle
arcuate fibres to the opposite interolivary layer and mesial fillet.
This latter structure was traced to the anterior quadrigeminal bodies
and optic thalamus.
    Owing to lesion in some of the experiments of the roots of the 5th

IV. " On      the Relations  of the Nucleus to Spore-formation in
         certain Liver-worts."     By J. Bretland Farmer, M.A.,
         Royal College of Science, London. Communicated by
         Professor Vines, F.R.S. Received November 9, 1893.
    It is well known that, as a general rule, during the formation of
spore tetrads from their mother cells, the nucleus of the latter com
monly undergoes two successive bipartitions.          Each of the resulting
four nuclei ultimately becomes a centre for the aggregation of a
portion of the original protoplasm, whilst division of the whole im
mediately follows by means of cell walls.
    Though the above method is the one most commonly followed
during the process of spore development, so far as the essential
 features are concerned, it is by no means the invariable one.         Prob
 ably, however, it is to be regarded as typical, and the deviations
about to be described should be interpreted as modifications of it.
    Anyone who is familiar with Hofmeister's drawings, or who has
ever seen spore production actually going on in the Hepaticae, must
 have noticed that, in many species, the mother cell of the tetrad
 becomes four-lobed previously to its breaking up into its four spores.
This lobed appearance is seen whilst the original nucleus is still
resting, and is due to a bulging out of the cell wall in four directions,
accompanied by an ingrowth of cellulose into the lumen of the cell,
and towards the nucleus.
    If the process be followed in Aneura multijida, the intruding walls
are seen to closely approach the nucleus while this body is still in the
resting state. The latter body then divides very rapidly, forming
 first ten, then twenty, chromosomes, which are arrayed along a very
 short spindle at the centre of the cell. Then another spindle appears
in a plane inclined to that of the first, and the number of the chromo
 somes is apparently about forty, though, by reason of their small
 size and the difference in their planes, it is difficult to be quite certain
 as to their number.    The nucleus here then goes through the ordinary
 form of karyokinesis, but in a somewhat compressed form. The four
 groups of ten chromosomes then move off along the achromatic
 spindles to their respective lobes, and the further ingrowth of the
 cell walls to the centre, where they meet, cuts off the several proto

 1893.]    Nucleus   to Spore-formation in certain Liver-worts.        479
plasmio portions of the four spores.     The achromatic spindle is fairly
well marked, and runs up sharply to a point in each lohe, and a
structure can often be seen at the end which possibly represents the
presence of a centrosome.
   In Aneura pinguis the case is somewhat      different.   The lobing of
the spore mother cell is much more apparent than in A. multifida,
and just before division occurs, a portion of the dense protoplasm
which surrounds the nucleus (and which should probably be regarded
as an archoplasm) protrudes as an achromatic spindle simultaneously
into each of the four cell lobes. This takes place while the nucleus
is still resting, and thus a quadripolar spindle is formed. The nucleus
then becomes also lobed, in such a way that it assumes a tetrabedral
shape, with an angle in contact with each achromatic sheaf.         I have
not, through scarcity of material, as yet been able to observe the
behaviour of the chromosomes in this species, but there is hardly
room for doubt that a simultaneous separation of the bodies into four
groups takes place. This conclusion is strongly supported by the
peculiar behaviour of the archoplasmic spindle already described.        It
should be mentioned that tho application of such stains as gentian-
violet and orange, or hematoxylin and orange, gives such clear results
that it is impossible to mistake the character of the process.
    The most conclusive results, as well as the most remarkable, were
obtained in the case of a tropical Liver-wort, Steetzia decipiens, which  I
collected when in Ceylon two years ago. The division of the nucleus
takes place at an extremely late period in the development of the
spores.    The intruding walls grow into the cavity of the mother cell
to such an extent as almost to touch the nucleus itself, whilst the
sculpturing so characteristic of the mature spore is quite obvious,
even before the nucleus exhibits any sign of approaching division.
I  have been fortunate in securing a large number of preparations in
which all the steps are clearly shown, and have further succeeded in
getting the important stages photographed.       The nucleus is invested
by a dense mass of protoplasm (archoplasm), and this, as in Aneura
pinguis, forms a quadripolar achromatic spindle whilst the nucleus
is still in the resting condition. The ends of the spindle severally
reach out to a point beyond the centre of each lobe. I have termed
the spindle achromatic, following the common usage, but, as a matter of
fact, it stains deeply with hematoxylin, safranin, or gentian- violet — a
 point of some interest. The chromatic portion of the nucleus now
forms a large mass in the centre, and becomes four-lobed, the lobes
 being united centrally till quite late.
    Then they become separate, and each breaks into two chromo
 somes of a rod-like shape, which are at first aggregated somewhat
 irregularly in the centre, from which the achromatic spindles diverge.
  Speedily, however, they arrange themselves in pairs, and each pair

furnishes the chromatic element to the daughter nucleus.                        The cell
walls rapidly meet in the centre, and their union is effected before
the reconstruction of the daughter nuclei. The spindle mass con
tracts up to the middle of each of the four cells, and invests the young
nucleus in the same manner as was the case with the original body.
    Often during this part of the process there appeared to be two
nuclei in each spore cell, but            I  regard this as probably due to an
unequal       contraction    of  the   archoplasmic       mass.     In many of the
daughter nuclei the two chromosomes could be detected for some
little time, but they frequently become more numerous, and they
finally lose their distinctness and are impossible to trace, though                      I
leave, for the present at least, the question of their real permanence
an open one.
    [Since the above was written, I have seen a quadripolar spindle,
also in Aneura multifida.           It is not so well marked as in A. pinguis,
and seems only to occur immediately before division.                     Its extremely
short duration is indicated by the fact that, although               I  possess several
hundred preparations, all fixed at nearly the same stage, in only two
of them is there unequivocal evidence of the existence of such a
spindle before the individualising of the chromosomes takes place. —

 V. " Sugar as a Food in the Production                      of Muscular Work."

        logy,      University       College,       London, Grocer Research

     It  may be said to have been universally believed that proteids
 were the essential producers of muscular work until the experiments
 of Voit* and Pettenkoferf showed that, within certain limits, mus
 cular work can be produced by carbohydrates.                      They did this by
 showing      the relative  amounts     of  nitrogen   eliminated    during muscular
 activity and repose. Subsequently, Chauveau and Kaufmann J showed,
 by comparing the quantity of sugar that disappeared from the blood
 traversing a muscle while contracting and at rest, that four times
 more sugar was used up during the period of muscular activity.
 Having failed to find any further recorded facts regarding sugar as a
 muscle food, I thought it desirable, in connexion with the investiga-

played by sugar in the animal organism, to try and ascertain,                       b}-

of muscular energy —         a    point of great value    to be decided       at the
present moment, when sugar     so cheap that its use need no longer
                                      is
be restricted to that of a mere palatable condiment, but     might,      it
perhaps, be profitably added to the daily diet of the working man as
a muscular power-producing element.
    With the object of,      ifpossible, settling this point, Iavailed myself
of the opportunity     I     had of making       series of experiments upon
                                                    a
myself with    Professor Mosso's ergograph, while working in the
autumn of 1892 in the Physiological Laboratory at Turin.*
   The amount of muscnlar energy developed by sugar was calculated
by the quantity of work that could be done by the muscles of the
middle finger of each hand, in       given time, before fatigue set in.
                                           a
And  I   think that the results obtained by experimenting with the
fingers may not unreasonably be regarded as         reliable indication of
                                                         a
the effects of sugar on the other muscles of the body.
   Throughout the whole time of the experiments, except when                   it   is
specially mentioned to the contrary, not only was the mode of life,
as regards the amount of sleep, &c, kept uniform and the same kind
of food taken, but, as nearly as possible, in the same quantities, along
with varying amounts of sugar taken.
   Each separate experiment with the ergograph was repeated every
two hours, a voluntary muscular contraction being made every two
seconds.    Being right-handed, a 4-kilo. weight was used for the right
finger and  a 3-kilo. one for the weaker left.
   The total height to which the weight was raised, being multiplied
by the weight, expressed in kilogrammetres the amount of work ac
complished.
  The amount of work done was calculated       by two methods: firstly,
the total amount of work accomplished up till fatigue set in secondly,
                                                                     ;
the amount of work accomplished                by
                                        each thirty voluntary muscular
contractions. The diurnal variations in the amount of work performed,
as pointed out by Lombard.f and confirmed in my own experiments,
rendered   it necessary to compare the results at precisely the same
hours on different days, in order to avoid error in drawing conclusions
of the value of sugar, as the muscular working capacity varies at
different times of the day.
   The first step was to ascertain the value of sugar when taken alone

    It  is here seen that the 500 grams (17^- ounces) of sugar retarded
the onset of fatigue by more than 150 seconds in both cases.                          The
left middle finger being capable of working 528 seconds, as against
374 seconds ; while the right worked 484 seconds, as against 300
seconds.
    The total work performed by the left middle finger was 34'311 kilos,
as against 19'425 kilos., giving a total gain of 76 per cent. ; the
right, 21-700 kilos, as against 13'476 kilos., yielding a total gain of
61 per cent, from the sugar.
    When the result obtained from each successive working of the ergo-
graph is compared, the total muscle-working power is apparently far
more increased than that obtained from merely thirty contractions.
This, in all probability, is due to the carbohydrates formed during
fasting, from the proteids of the tissues, being sufficient for the per
formance of a small amount of work, though the supply is insufficient
for prolonged work. When, however, sugar is taken, it supplies the

      He'-e   it is  seen   that 200 grams (7 ounces) of sugar increased the
  amount of work performed, both by the left and right hand.                                  The
  increase in the quantity of work done being most marked in the case
  of the right finger, for it was 39'06 per cent., whereas the left was
  only 6'16 per cent. It is farther seen that, although the taking of
   the sugar caused an immediate increase in the work done, the in
  crease was far more marked two and a half hours later; that is to
  say, when its assimilation had taken place.
      Having thus ascertained that sugar increases the power of doing
  muscular work when added to a small meal, 1 will now give an
  example of what it does when added to a full one ; that is to say, a
   luncheon consisting of beefsteak with vegetables, an omelet, and

the meal at 12.30.

    In this   table  it is seen that when 250 grams (8£ ounces) of sugar
are added to a        full meal the power of doing muscular work is in
creased.
    In this   instance     it was the left hand that showed the greatest in
crease in working power, for it gave on the sugar day 16'599 per
cent., while the right only yielded 8'433 per cent, more work.                           As
usual, on both of the above days exactly the same quantities of food
were taken, so that the only difference in them was the taking of
250 grams of sugar on the one and not on the other day.                         From this
one is forced to conclude that sugar when added even to a copious
meal has a most important power in increasing the human capabilities
of doing muscular work.
    I now give the result of the amount of work done on 250 grams cf
sugar in two periods of eight hours each, where in one case the sugar
was taken in divided portions at three different times — 100 grams
(3i   ounces) at 8 a.m., and 100 grams           again at 12        A..M., and 50 grams

    It will be here noticed that the gain in work during the nine hours
by taking sugar was in the case of the left finger 22-032 per cent.,
and the right finger 35-858 per cent.                    And that fatigue was retarded
in the one ease 12 seconds and in the other 180 seconds.
    Thus it is seen that when 250 grams (8f ounces) of sugar is taken
along with ordinary diet, it not only prolongs the time during which
work can be done, but also increases the total amount of work per
formed in eight honrs.                 It is further seen that the sugar taken at
3.50    p.m.     had   the   effect   of   increasing the work done at 5.30 and
 5.40 p.m., and that, instead of there being the usual diurnal fall in the
 amount of work done in the afternoon, there was actually an increase
 in the total amount of work accomplished.

 1893.]     Changes in the Blood consequent upon Inflammations.      487
    Conclusion  :—
    1. Sugar when    taken   alone is a muscle  food.   500 grams   (17^
         ounces) of sugar increased in my case the amount of muscular
         work done  on a fasting day from 61 to 76 per cent.
    2. The muscle   energy-producing effect of sugar is so great that
         200 grams (7 ounces) added to a small meal increased the
         total amount of work done from 6 to 30 per cent.
    3. That when sugar was added to a large meal it increased the total
         amount of work done»from 8 to 16 per cent.
    4. That the work done during a period of eight hours can be in
         creased from 22 to 36 per cent, by taking 250 grams (8| ounces)
         of sugar.
    5. That when sugar is taken at 3.50 p.m. it not only obliterates the
         normal diurnal fall in the muscular power, which usually
         occurs at 5.30 p.m., but even causes an actual increase in the
         total amount of work done.

   This note describes, and attempts to interpret, in a preliminary
manner certain anatomical alterations in the blood noted in experi
ments on the acute local inflammation of various tissues.      The con
tents of the communication are as follows : —
   I. (1) Description of   the method employed for the induction of
the local inflammation.
   (2) Description of the methods followed in examining the com
position of the blood.
   II.  Summary of the alterations observed.        The chief of these
alterations are (1) inspissation of the blood ; (2) reduction of the
number of heemic leucocytes followed by increase of the number of
them, followed in some cases by a final decrease of their number to
below the original normal ; (3) disturbance of the mutual ratios
normal between the different kinds of hsemic leucocytes.             The
summary is illustrated by quotation of protocols from certain of the
experiments —
   a.  Wh en the site of inflammation is in the limb.
   3.  When the site of inflammation is primarily peritoneal.
   7.  When the site of inflammation is primarily in a mucous surface.

  III.   Interpretations offered for the          haamic changes found   —
  (1) For the inspissation observed in the blood.
  (2) For the fall, and subsequent rise, of the number of leucocytes
in the blood.
   (3) For the disturbance of the ratios normal between the numbers
of the different kinds of leucocytes in the blood.    This last sub
section is preceded by a brief account of the cell characters upon
which reliance has been placed in the Rorting of the hemic leuco

       OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
   Jambs Jago,    B.A. (Cantab.) and M.D. (Oxon.), was a physician of
 considerable    repute in West Cornwall.         He was born on De
 cember 18,   1815, at the barton of Kigilliack, Budock, near Falmonth,
 once  a seat of the    Bishops of Exeter. He was the second son of
 Mr. John Jago, and the representative of an old Cornish family, who
 were resident in the parish of St. Erme, near Truro, before the year
 1588.   One of his lineal ancestors was a staunch Parliamentarian,
 who was appointed a Commissioner of Sequestration by Oliver
 Cromwell, after the death of Charles I. Young Jago received his
 early education at the Falmouth Classical and Mathematical School,
 where he remained a pupil until about 1833. About this time he
expressed a strong desire to go through a course of training at one
of the Universities, but preparatory to this he had the benefit of
 some private tuition.     He had, however, always a great respect for
the instruction he received in the Falmouth School, and he retained
 a deep interest in its prosperity to tbe end of his life.
   In 1835 Mr. Jago entered St. John's College, Cambridge, as a
pensioner, and graduated B.A. in the Mathematical Tripos of 1839 as
32nd Wrangler.        Soon after obtaining his degree, he resolved to
adopt the medical profession as his future occupation of life.        For
this purpose, and to obtain the necessary qualifications, he studied at
various hospitals in London, Dublin, and Paris.            But anxious to
obtain a good medical degree, he resolved to go through a special
second course of training at the University of Oxford, where he
accordingly entered his name as a student, both in arts and medicine,
on the books of Wadham College, from which he graduated B.A.
and M.B. in 1843, and finally M.D. in 1859.
   During the early years of his professional career, after he had
chosen Truro for his residence, Dr. Jago was a voluminous writer on
various medical subjects, the most important of which were investi
gations on certain special diseases of the eye.     One of his first con
tributions on this subject, contained in a series of papers published
in the ' London Medical Gazette,' is that entitled " Points in the
Physiology and Diseases of the Eye."        In these papers he developed
certain entoptical methods of exploring the eye by means of
divergent beams of light, which he considered to be an explanation
which preceded all like solutions of the problem.        In 1854 he com
municated to the Boyal Society a paper on " Ocular Spectres and
   vol. Liv.                                                      b

                                          11
   Structures as Mutual Exponents," which was followed by another
   on the same subject in 1856.         In 1857 a paper " On the Functions
   of the Tympanum
                        " was also read before the Royal Society.            These
                                             '
   three papers are published in the Proceedings.' Among his other
   medical papers, which are mostly inserted in the proceedings of
   kindred societies, or in medical journals, the following titles will give
   a good notion of Dr. Jago's original investigations.
                                                                 " The Eustachian
                                               "           "
   Tube : why opened in Deglutition ?              1856 ;    Pains in the Abdo
   minal and Thoracic Walls," 1861; "Ophthalmoscopic Mnscae Voli-
  tantes in a very Myopic Eye," 1861; "Medicine as influenced by
  Scientific Tendencies," 1861 ; " Entacoustics," 1868; and important
  papers on
                " Entoptics," published in the ' British and Foreign
  Chirurgical Review,' 1859.       So much interest was taken in Dr. Jago's
  papers   on  Entoptics   that  he was encouraged to continue his inves
  tigations on this subject, which resulted in a publication of a separate
                                                '
  treatise in 1864 under the title of             Entoptics, with its Uses in
  Physiology and Medicine,' giving not only his own views in some
  detail, but also those of other writers.        This work is an exposition of
 a difficult subject, especially as the author has ventured on un
 trodden ground while investigating and suggesting explanations
 of phenomena which had not hitherto been sufficiently accounted
 for.    Dr. Jago was also a contributor to the ' Journal of the Royal
 Institution of Cornwall,' which contains his papers " On Observa
 tions of the Solar Phenomenon of April 5, 1871 ;
                                                            " "
                                                                Nangitha Cross,"
 with illustrations ; and    " Ancient Cross at       Trelanvean,   St. Keverne."
     During the last forty years or more, Dr. Jago took a considerable
 interest in the proceedings of the Royal Institution of Cornwall at
 Truro.     He had served as Honorary Secretary for many years, and
 in 1873 was elected President for two years.                    His presidential
addresses, delivered at the annual meetings of the Institntiou, have
all been marked as giving the history and progress of Cornish
science, and even at the present time may be read with, profit. As
a Vice-President      he continued so long as he was able to take his
personal share of work, and his presence on all occasions was always
looked upon as certain. Lately, however, owing to his feeble health,
he was compelled to retire altogether from any active participation
in the management of the Institution.                This forced retirement of
Dr. Jago from so many of his old associations was much regretted by
his friends.      He, however, remained a Vice-President until his
death, and, though he was unable to attend the meetings, his interest
in the proceedings never abated.           In 1856, Dr. Jago was appointed
Physician to the- Royal        Cornwall   Infirmary, and he was also con
nected with other medical institutions at Truro.              On June 2, 1870,
he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.
    Dr. Jago was married in 1864 to Maria Jones, daughter of Mr.

                                       Ill
 Richard    Pearce, of Penzance, by whom ho leaves two daughters.
 Seven or eight years ago he had an attack of paralysis, which com
 pelled him to retire from practice.       He had since been an invalid,
 getting gradually weaker from year to year, though he was able to
 take his usual daily drive till within a few days of his death.          He
 died on  January   18, 1893, at the age of seventy-seven.
                                                                     E. D.
    The Rev. Chari.es Pkitcharp, D.D., Savilian Professor of Astro
nomy in the University of Oxford, was born at Alberbury, Shropshire,
on February 29, 1808, being the fourth son of Mr. William
Pritcbard.      In his early youth he was sent to a private school at
Uxbridge,    of  which his recollections were slight, but the little that he
did remember of its internal and economical arrangements were not
pleasant. When nearly eleven years old he was removed to Merchant
Taylors' School, to which, according to an entry in Robinson's
Registers of the school, he was admitted in January, 1819. In those
hardy days it was the custom of the school to commence work at
7 in the morning, and, as young Pritchard's home was at Brixton, be
was accustomed, for a year and a half or more, to take this long and
weary walk of nearly four miles at a very early hour, regardless of
rain or fog.       Referring to this period of his schooldays, in bis
'Annals of our School Life,' Pritcbard says:         "I  do not remember
      I
that ever complained of this severe arrangement ; I was old enough
to be aware that temporary economical necessities were the cause,
and   I can never forget that the words most frequently heard in my
home were 'education,' 'education'; so I suppose        I  felt I was being
'             "
  educated.'      Apparently, however, he did not profit so much as he
desired from the instruction he received at this school.
   From Merchant Taylors' young Pritcbard was transferred to an
admirable academy at Poplar, conducted by a Mr. John Stock — a
self-educated,    energetic, and practical man, of very considerable
abilities. Here he felt more in his natural element, and he always
referred to the practical training he received at this school with the
greatest respect.     In addition to the general school education usually
obtainable at that time, the senior pupils were indulged with the
sight and handling of a number of instruments and working models
made and used by the celebrated Ferguson, the astronomer.              These
included some telescopes and quadrants, which excited the curiosity
of young Pritchard and other intelligent youths, and probably, in his
case, formed the turning-point of scientific proclivities.           He has
himself said that " very many of us could use the theodolite, and
could survey and plot an estate. Our practice-ground was mainly in
the Isle of Dogs, at that time an all but unoccupied waste, and I well
remember how, at the age of less than sixteen, 1 earned two guineas
                                                                   b 2

                                    IV
for indoctrinating an intending colonist in the art of field-surveying.
I did not leave him until we had completed the plan of Kennington
Common, and had calculated its acreage."         On leaving this excellent
private school, after about two years'     tuition, young Pritchard had
an opportunity of becoming a private pupil of the Head Master of
Christ's Hospital School, who was at that time permitted to take a
limited number of private pupils and place them in the public classes
under his own personal care. Here young Pritchard attended to his
classical studies with great diligence.     He was accustomed to recall
to his mind, with satisfaction, that, for about a twelvemonth, he was
placed at the head of the Deputy Grecians.
    Owing to family pecuniary difficulties, arising from the failure of
a manufacture conscientiously but unsuccessfully persevered in by
his father, young Pritchard was reluctantly withdrawn from Christ's
Hospital School.      A question now naturally arose in his family as to
the future occupation of the youth, who was not yet seventeen years
of age, and considered to possess a more than average amount of
scholastic knowledge, scientific tastes, and literary abilities.    Fortu
nately, by the advice and intervention of an elder brother, he was
permitted to follow his own devices for continuing his education as
best he could, with the ultimate hope that means would be found
somehow to enable him to enter one of the Universities.          " So," he
has remarked,      " I was left to my own resources, and happily a
genuine love of knowledge of any and every sort stirred within my
intellectual frame; and, inasmuch as the most attainable form of
knowledge for the untutored was, and still is, mathematics, so to
mathematics I betook myself with a will."
    These two years, 1824 — 1826, were mostly devoted to self-instruc
tion, and in this interval he made some acquaintance             with the
                        '                                     '
contents of Wood's Algebra,' Woodhouse's treatise on Plane and
                                                              '
 Spherical Trigonometry,' Dr. Lardner's treatises on            Analytical
 Geometry and the Differential Calculus,' and other mathematical
works       At the same time he attended some courses of lectures on
 chemistry, delivered at Guy's Hospital.      He was much interested in
 these lectures, and ever after in the science, the benefit of which was
 reaped in after years at Clapham.     In 1825, when only seventeen, he
 first felt the ambition of authorship, and published an ' Introduction
 to Arithmetic,' in which the elementary properties of numbers are
 explained and demonstrated on the simplest principles. In main-
 respects, these two years turned out to be an important epoch in the
 life of Pritchai'd, for by the most determined perseverance in his
 own studies, and by the assistance of friends and relatives, who
 engaged to furnish temporarily the requisite funds, he was enabled,
 soon after Easter, 1820, to enrol his name on the books of St. John's
 College, Cambridge.

   "While in residence at Cambridge, Pritchard was fortunate in
having the assistance of Charles Jeffreys as his private tutor — an
excellent mathematician, and Second Wrangler in Airy's year, 1823.
He, from the first, took a good position in the college examinations,
and always secured the second place in each year.              The practical
result of this success was of the highest importance to him, as the
accumulation of exhibitions was ultimately sufficient to defray all the
necessary expenses of his college education.           In the Mathematical
Tripos     of  1830,  Pritchard    attained  the   high position of Fourth
 Wrangler. He was himself fully satisfied with the result, though it
was the general opinion of the college tutors who had watched his
career that he had hardly done himself full justice in the examina
tion. His position in the Tripos was, however, sufficient to secure
for him a limited number of private pupils, without interfering with
his classical studies, to which he now devoted most of his time, as he
was unwilling to risk the Fellowship examination, then almost wholly
classical.    In March, 1832, he attained the height of his ambition, by
being elected a Fellow of his college.        Pupils now flocked to him in
superabundance,       and appearances seemed to indicate that he was
destined to settle down as a resident Fellow, and take an active
share in the public tuition of his college.         But other circumstances
soon arose, preventing any arrangement        of this kind. Some scholastic
employment haviDg been offered to him in connexion with a new
proprietary school in London, he determined to forego his University
prospects, and to seek his fate in the larger world of the metropolis.
Writing more than fifty years afterwards, on referring to this im
                                                 "
portant crisis in his life, he remarked that looking back now through
the vista of half a century, I cannot wholly satisfy my mind as to all
the motives which impelled me, at so early a period of a successful
academical career, to relinquish the natural hopes and ambitions
which must have legitimately presented themselves.            It might have
been impatience.       But still, looking back through the busy occupa
tions of many subsequent years, I am inclined to doubt if I could
have occupied them more advantageously in any other role of life
than that in which I have actually engaged."
   When still an undergraduate, Pritchard's originality of thought
often induced him to consider other mathematical questions than
those required in the college examinations.               He was especially
interested    with  certain trigonometrical   relations  brought to light by
the mathematician Poinsot, which led him to examine other writings
of the same author, more particularly his treatise on the ' Theory of
Statical Couples.'        Pritchard became quite enamoured with the
singular power and wide application of the theory, and also with the
clear light that Poinsot had thrown on much that had hitherto been
 obscure in the theory of mechanics.        He has said with enthusiasm : —

                                     VI
 "                         I
   I could not rest until had simplified the subject and brought my
joy and my light within the ken of others." His interest in Poinsot's
 work resulted in the publication of a little treatise on the ' Theory of
 Statical Couples,' which was sufficiently popular to ran through two
editions, and to be adopted in the general University teaching.
About the same time he contributed to the Cambridge Philosophical
Society a paper on " The Figure of the Earth," consisting of a sim
plification of the final propositions in the mathematical treatment of
the Earth, considered as heterogeneous.
    In 1833 Pritchard accepted the post of Head Master of a new pro
prietary school at. Stockwell — one of those founded about that time
in the suburbs of London under the auspices of King's College.        The
tenure of this office was, however, in no way an agreeable one, for,
from the date of his appointment, his relations with a minority of the
Committee were unfortunate.         The school flourished numerically,
notwithstanding the ceaseless interference and sundry small annoy
ances to which he was subjected.        As time went on, these personal
differences increased, until they became so unbearable to Pritchard
that in June, 1834, he resigned his office, and had serious thoughts of
returning once more to the more peaceful occupation of a University
life. But, owing to the prospect of an early marriage, by which his
Fellowship would be vacated, and finding that some of the leading
men in Clapham, and also many of the parents of his pupils, had ex
pressed a strong desire for the establishment of a new school under
better and more liberal regulations, he, after some consideration,
consented to superintend such an institution.         On this basis the
well-known Clapham Grammar School was founded in August, 1834.
    In this school Pritchard continued to be the central and controlling
spirit during the following twenty-eight years, labouring in the
cause of high middle-class education with untiring energy and
success, by which he obtained very rapidly a high reputation as a
successful teacher.     The many schemes he devised during this period
for the thorough training of his numerous pupils have been highly
appreciated.    Some of them have been adopted with advantage in
other schools.    In an article contained in the 'Nineteenth Century'
for March, 1884, the Dean of Westminster, Dr. Bradley, who re
ceived his early education at Stockwell, and afterwards at Clapham,
bears personal testimony to the enlarged and generous views of his
old teacher. The article gives a most interesting description of the
early days of the school, and of the practical methods employed by
Pritchard to interest the boys in their studies : —•" He, first of all, at
a time when the real study of comparative philology was almost
unknown in England, gave us some glimpses into what I may call
the science of language ; he taught us to try to group together facts
for ourselves, and to form laws from what we observed and met.

                                      Vll
   And he did more, he taught us something at the same time of the
  beauty and charm of literature, old and new. But this was not all ;
  no single week passed in which we did not receive and eagerly look
  forward to at least one lesson in natural science. Heat, elementary
  hydrostatics, mechanics, optics, electricity, and, above all, chemistry —
  to something of the elements of all these we wero introduced in turn.
  Meantime we were led through stage after stage of the severe dis
                                                      I
 cipline of mathematical study. I felt then, as feel now, that oven
  the study of mathematics was coloured with the warm glow of the
 activity and originality of the teacher's mind."
     The reputation of the Clapham Grammar School was sufficient to
 attract pupils from all parts of the kingdom. One important feature
  was the interesting fact that among them might be found the sons of
 distinguished men at the head of the several branches of science, and
 of the liberal professions.      The names of Airy, Barry, Darwin,
  Gassiot, Grove, Hamilton, Herschel, Maurice, and others, became
 familiar in the roll-call. For reasons possessing only a personal in
 terest, Pritchard brought his Clapham life rather suddenly to a close
 in the year 1862, when he transferred all his interests in the school to
 Dr. Alfred Wrigley, one of the Professors at Addiscombe. He then
 retired, with his family, to Freshwater, Isle of Wight, where he
 hoped to enjoy a few years' repose, intending afterwards to apply
 himself to the permanent duties of some pastoral charge.
    Pritchard was of far too active a mind to remain long in retire
 ment.    For some time his ambition seems to have been directed to
 some preferment in the Church, but his hopes were doomed to disap
pointment. He always considered himself to be a divine in mind and
 heart, though, by the force of circumstances, he became first a school
 master and then a professional      astronomer.    It has been stated by
one of his late assistants that,  " so anxious was he for a cure of souls,
 that he applied to one of his old pupils, who was then a Bishop, and
asked for a living of only £100 a year.      He was refused, and felt the
refusal keenly." In some form or other he was, however, frequently
engaged in clerical work during his seven or eight years of retreat. On
several occasions he was invited to preach before the British Asso
ciation at the annual meetings, first at Nottingham in 1866, and
afterwards at Dundee in 1867, Norwich in 1868, Exeter in 1869, and
Bristol in 1876. He also delivered addresses, generally on the harmony
of the Bible and science, at various Church Congresses.         Vice-Chan
cellor Page Wood, afterwards Lord Chancellor Hatherley, to whom
Pritchard alludes as " the friend of his life," was much impressed
with the treatment of the subject in the Nottingham sermon, and was
induced to write a short treatise on the ' Continuity of the Holy
Scriptures,' based on the same line of argument adopted by Pritchard.
This celebrated sermon led to his appointment as Hulsean Lecturer

                                     Vlll
at Cambridge in 1867. He was one of the Select Preachers at Cam
bridge in 1869, and at Oxford in 1876 and 1877.
   Pritchard's occupations during his residence at Freshwater were
not by any means confined to clerical duty, as for some time before
 and after he left Clapham he felt much personal interest in the affairs
 of the Royal Astronomical Society, and in astronomical researches
generally. The first paper contributed by him to the Society, bear
                                                                  '
ing upon the practical part of astronomy, is contained in the Monthly
          '
Notices for January 14, 1853, giving an account of some experi
ments towards increasing facility and certainty in the use of mercury
in observations by reflexion, and for the adjustments of astronomical
instruments. In 1856 he became a member of the Council, and
shortly afterwards read a paper, the result of considerable calculation,
on "The Conjunctions of the planets Jupiter and Saturn in the years
B.C. 7, B.C. 66, and a.d. 54."    This memoir was written to correct an
astronomical    error  in  which Ideler and others had fallen, while
attempting to establish the date of the true Annus Domini. Astro
nomy, indeed, was not neglected at Clapham, for an observatory,
furnished with an equatorial and a transit instrument, was actually
added to the other institutions of the school, and Pritchard built
another observatory for his private use at Freshwater. This long
personal interest in astronomical research as an amateur led to his
appointment, in 1862, to the responsible post of Honorary Secretary
of the Royal Astronomical Society, and, subsequently, to that of
President for two yearsj 1866— 1868. His zeal for the interests of
this Society and the promotion of astronomy was so great that, though
resident in the Isle of Wight, he made it his duty to be present at
most of its meetings.     It is a pleasing record of scientific devotion to
state   that, during his two years' tenure of the Presidency, he was
able to preside over the ordinary meetings fourteen out of a possible
sixteen times.     His addresses delivered at the anniversary meetings
of the Society, on presenting the Gold Medal to the medallists of
1867 and 1868, are not only models of elegance of language, but they
are also masterly expositions of both the new and old astronomy, in
connexion with those sections of the science for which the Medals
were respectively awarded : that of 1867 to Huggins and Miller for
their joint researches in astronomical physics ; and that of 1868 to the
great French astronomer Le Verrier for his sublime mathematical
investigations on the planetary theories, and the construction of new
tables of the motions of Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and Mars in their
orbits.
   By the death of Professor Donkin in November, 1869, the Savilian
Professorship of Astronomy at Oxford became vacant.             Candidates
from all parts of the world were eligible, and the appointment of a
new Professor was at that time in the hands of thirteen trustees, in

                                    IX
 eluding Pritcbard's friend, Lord Chancellor Hatherley. No one knew
 more than Sir John Herschel of the qualifications of Pritchard to
 fulfil the required conditions necessary for giving sound instruction
on theoretical and practical astronomy.       It was, therefore, by Sir
John's urgent recommendation, together with the advice of other
 leading Fellows of the Royal Astronomical Society, that the Lord
 Chancellor was prevailed upon to exercise his great influence in bis
 favour.    No doubt this high patronage had its value, for at a meeting
 of the trustees, held early in 1870, he had the good fortune to be
 elected Savilian Professor of Astronomy.
    Now comes a remarkable example of the intellectual strength and
 energy of Pritchard's character.    At the date of his appointment he
 had reached the age of sixty-two, and, at the same time, had had very
little personal experience of the practical work required in a large
observatory.    Most people of his age and habits, after having passed
a busy life, are naturally looking forward to some relief from
 their ordinary daily occupations ; or, at any rate, they are generally
 desirous to maintain, in any new official position, some conservatism
 of ideas and methods.      But this was in no way the case with Pro
 fessor Pritchard, who at once resolved that his Professorship was to
 be no sinecure for him ; but that, on the contrary, he felt sure that
 some instrumental means would be found to enable him to contribute
his share towards the progress of some of the most delicate problems
in astronomical physics. To effect this, however, a new University
 Observatory would be required, and how this could be accomplished
was for some time the principal subject that occupied his thoughts.
 In due time he laid his proposition before the governing authorities
of the University, requesting that the Savilian Professor should be
provided with astronomical instruments adequate to the instruction
of his class and for the purposes of original research.      The formal
application was    made  to Convocation  in March,  1873, when   a liberal
sum of money was granted, sufficient for the purchase of a refracting
telescope of 12^- inches aperture, and for erecting a suitable building
to contain it.   This grant was soon afterwards supplemented by Dr.
Warren De La line's munificent gift of his 13-inch reflecting telescope,
and many other valuable astronomical instruments, formerly belong
ing to his private observatory at Cranford. Thus, before the end of
1875, the University Observatory was completed, fully equipped and
ready for active work for the promotion of the study of practical and
philosophical astronomy.
   It is not possible to find space in this notice for an adequate
description of the numerous contributions to astronomical physics
emanating from the labours of Professor Pritchard and his two
assistants.   With instruments of the most modern construction, tbey
have been able to accomplish much that is new in some of the most

 delicate   branches   of astronomical    observation,  without intrenching
on the regular work of other official observatories.         The results have
                                 '           '      '
been mostly printed in the Memoirs and Monthly Notices of the
                                                 '
Royal Astronomical Society,' or in the Proceedings of the Royal
Society,' to which reference should be made for the details of the
separate researches.       Of the fifty papers chiefly contributed to these
 Societies since 1870, it will suffice, here, to give the titles only of a few
of the most important : " On the Moon's Photographic Diameter,
and on the Applicability of Celestial Photography to accurate Measure
       " " Ou a

metria Nova Oxoniensis," containing the relative magnitudes of 2,784

Proper Motions of 40 Stars in the Pleiades"; "On the Capacities,
in respect of Light and Photographic Action, of two Silver on Glass
Mirrors of different Focal Lengths " ; " Determination of the Parallax
of 30 Stars, chiefly of the Second Magnitude, by the Photographic
Method," &c. Professor Pritchard also undertook a share of the
observations      for the new International Photographic Chart of the
Heavens.       The special zone of six degrees between 31° and 25° N.
declination has been allotted to the Oxford University Observatory,
and, at the time of his death, some progress in the work had been
made.
   In addition to the astronomical researches carried on under Pro
fessor Pritchard's direction, some most excellent papers and treatises
of a  popular nature were written by him from time to time.             Not the
                                                                      '
least interesting are the three eloges contributed to the               Annual

on the deaths of P. G. W. Struve, Director of the Pulkowa Observa
tory, Sir W. Rowan Hamilton, and Sir John F. W. Her.schel.                  He
                                                          '

was the author of " The Star of the Magi in the ' Biblical Dictionary,'
                                               "
and of several articles in the ninth edition of the ' Encyclopaedia
Britannica.'      He also collected some of his miscellaneous writings
into a volume entitled ' Occasional Thoughts of an Astronomer on
Nature and Revelation.'
   His Savilian Lectures, both on theoretical and practical astronomy,
were usually well attended, especially by intending candidates for
mathematical honours.         Owing to constant and increasing applies

                                     XI
tions   of University students for practical instruction, he provided a
subsidiary observatory on the roof of the lecture room for their special
 use.   Eecently he erected a more convenient building, which he fur
 nished with some excellent instruments. Every accommodation was
thus provided for the instruction of the students, without in any way
interfering with the larger instruments reserved solely for research.
    Professor Pritchard proceeded to the degree of M.A. (Cantab.) in
 1833, M.A. by decree (Oxon.) in 1870, and B.D. and D.D. in 1880.
 He was ordained Deacon in 1833, and Priest in 1834.      On taking up
his residence at Oxford, he attached himself to New College, of which,
as Savilian Professor of Astronomy, he became a Fellow in 1883. He
was elected, in 1886, an Honorary Fellow of St. John's College, Cam
bridge — an honour he greatly esteemed. He was a Fellow of the
Royal Society for more than half a century, having been elected so
long ago as February 6, 1840.           He served on the Council two
years, from November,    1885  to 1887, and at the Anniversary Meeting
held on November 30, 1892, he was presented with one of the Royal
 Medals for his successful labours on photometry and stellar parallax.
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society on April
13, 1849, and was a continuous member of the Council from 1856 to
1877, and from 1883 to 1887. In 1886 he was awarded the Gold
                                   '
Medal of that Society for his Photometric Researches.'           He was
also a Fellow of the Geological Society and the Cambridge Philo
sophical Society. As Savilian Professor of Astronomy, he was an
ex-offido member of the Board of Visitors of the Royal Observatory,
Greenwich.
    The great age to which Professor Pritchard attained never inter
fered with his determination to make the University Observatory a
first class institution.   His mental faculties were unclouded to the
end ; he was always able to keep abreast with the newest problems
in the physics of astronomy, and it- was a frequent and pleasing sight
to witness the venerable astronomer        enter into the depths of a
technical discussion, with all the interest and energy of youth.      In
the midst of his scientific and University career, ho did not, however,
forget the busy time he had passed with his pupils in his old school at
Clapham. In 1886, soon after he had received both scientific and
college honours, it was a great joy to him to receive an invitation to
a complimentary banquet at the Albion, Aldersgate Street, from his
" Old Boys," among whom grisly beards and grey heads predomi
nated.    An interesting result of this social meeting of his old pupils,
presided over by the Dean of Westminster, was a small volume,
written by him for private distribution, full of pleasing reminiscences
of his former school life.
    Professor Pritchard was twice married : — (1) at Lambeth, on
December 18, 1834, to Emily, fifth daughter of J. Newton, Esq.; and

                                     Xll
(2) at St. Peter's, Croydon, on August 10, 1858, to Rosalind, danghter
of Alexander Campbell, Esq., of Tunbridge Wells.          His second wife
predeceased him about a year.         During the later years of his life,
though naturally feeling the increasing weakness of old age, his
health continued fairly good almost to the end, while the daily work
of the Observatory never ceased to occupy his thoughts. He was
fond of botany, and was a great lover of floriculture of the highest
order.    At one time he was supposed to possess one of the best collec
tions of ferns in England.      This love of flowers and plants continued
as a  pleasant recreation.  It was only a week before he passed away
that he was pointing out to a friend, with conscious pride, the beauty
of the garden he had created around the Observatory. His death
took place on the morning of Sunday, May 28, 1893, in the eighty-
sixth year of his age ; and on the following Wednesday afternoon his
remains were laid to rest in Holywell Cemetery, Oxford.
                                                                  E. D.
   Henry Francis Blanford was born June             3, 1834, in Bouverie
Street, Whitefriars, London, where his father, William Blanford,
carried on a manufacture of gilt mouldings for decorative purposes,
picture frames, &c, in premises now converted into the printing
                '             '
offices of the Daily News newspaper.
   The subject of the present memoir received his early edncation at
schools in Brighton and Brussels, and after studying for some time
at the School of Design, first in Somerset House, then in Marl
borough House, he entered the Royal School of Mines, in Jermyn
Street, at its commencement in 1851.          At the School of Mines, ho
took the first place of the year, and at the conclusion of the first
year's term, received the only prize then offered, the Duke of Corn
wall's Scholarship. After leaving the school, he passed a year in
studying mining at the Bergakademie of Freiberg, and another year,
part of which he employed in translating v. Kobell's book on the
blowpipe, his first published work, in London.
   In 1855, Mr. Blanford and his brother, also a School of Mines
student, received appointments on the staff of the Geological Survey
of India, under the late Dr. T. Oldham, and they arrived in Calcutta
at the end of September.     Shortly after, the two brothers and Mr. W.
Theobald, another member of the staff, were despatched to Orissa, to
report upon a coal-field around Talchir, in the wild tract of the
Tributary Mehals. Of this coal-field nothing except the existence of
coal was known at the time; the whole of the geology had to be
made out from the examination of the ground, the greater part of
which was covered with forest.         It was under these circumstances
that, mainly through the observations of Mr. H. F. Blanford, the first
steps were taken towards the classification of the remarkable series

                                        XU1
of deposits     associated   with   the   Indian coal-bearing beds, by the
separation of the underlying or Talchir division, and of an overlying
group, from the true coal measures, subsequently called, by Dr. Old
ham, the Damuda beds.
    For some time Mr. H. F. Blanford was engaged in Calcutta, in
charge of the Survey Office, and in paleeontological work in the
museum, but in 1857 he was placed at the head of a large survey
party that was despatched to Madras, and he was chiefly engaged
for the next three or four years in examining the cretaceous beds
near Trichinopaly and Pondicherry, some fossils from which, de
scribed by Professor E. Forbes,             Sir P. Egerton and Mons. A.
d'Orbigny, had attracted much attention. The stratigraphy and the
distinction of the different divisions in the field were founded, on
palseontological      evidence, and the classification     established by Mr.
Blanford was fully confirmed by Dr. Stoliczka's subsequent exhaustive
description of the fauna.          A commencement of this description was
made by Mr. Blanford himself, who, before he left the Indian Geological
 Survey in 1862. published an account of the Nautilidse and Belemni-
                 '
tidaa    in the    Palceontologia Indica.'     The geology of the area was
described by him in the Memoirs of the Survey, to which he also
contributed an account of the Nilgiri Hills.
    Mr. Blanford's retirement from the survey was due to various
causes, amongst which was the injury to his health produced by the
exposure to the climate entailed by geological surveying. Soon after
leaving India he was offered the Science Professorship in the
 Presidency College, Calcutta, by the late Mr. W. Atkinson, at that
time Director of Public Instruction in Bengal.               This appointmeut
 Mr. Blanford accepted, and after spending some months in Europe to
 recruit his health, he joined the staff of the Bengal Educational
 Department towards the end of 1862.             He became, in 1864, one of
 the hon. secretaries of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and about the
 same time, partly in consequence of his duties as secretary, his atten
 tion was directed to meteorology.* On October 5th, 1864, Calcutta
 was visited by one of the most destructive cyclones on record ; a
  storm-wave rushed up the Hooghly River, and flooded the neigh
  bouring low lands ; upwards of 40,000 human beings were drowned,
  and a great part of the shipping in the river was wrecked.                 This
 cyclone    was   followed   within  a few   weeks  by  another,   which  passed
 over Masulipatam, and the storm-wave again caused the loss of
 about 30,000 lives.       These startling disasters naturally aroused the
 attention of the Indian Government and the public generally to the
 necessity of systematic meteorological          observations, and to the im-
     * The account of Mr. Blanford's meteorological work is bv Mr.    J. Eliot, his
  successor as Meteorological Reporter to the Government of India.

                                    XIV
portance of establishing a proper system of storm-warnings for the
protection of the ports of India, and especially Calcntta.
   Up to the date mentioned almost the only trustworthy records
of meteorological     observations  in India were those which had
been kept for several years at the observatories of Madras and
Bombay, and at the Surveyor- General's office in Calcutta. It is true
that observations were also taken at a number of hospitals and dis
pensaries throughout India ; but the instruments had not been verified,
the observers were untrained, and there was no proper supervision ;
moreover no care had been taken to preserve         the records.  Mr. H.
Piddington had collected and published in the     'Journal of the Asiatic
Society of Bengal,' details of 23 different cyclones in the Indian and
Chinese Seas, a work of the greatest interest and value, but the data,
which were naturally imperfect, whilst adding greatly to the
knowledge of these storms, and whilst sufficing to enable Mr. Pid
dington to frame practical directions for the guidance of sailors dnring
such storms in the India seas, had not led to a full understanding of
the disturbances, or of their origin.
   At the instance of General (then Colonel) R. Strachey, who, in 1857,
called the attention of the Asiatic Society to the uselessness of the
desultory attempts that had up to that time been made to acqnire a
knowledge of Indian meteorology, and to the urgent need of some
controlling authority capable of directing and utilising the work of
observers in India, a committee was formed which, after some un
successful attempts at acting as a controlling power, drew up, in
1862, a report in which the establishment        of a small centralized
system by    the Government     was  recommended.      At the request of
the Government, the Committee, after some delay, drew up a scheme
for carrying out the system recommended.       This was not submitted
to the Government till 1865, after the occurrence of the Calcutta and
Masulipatam cyclones.      Meantime the Indian Government had been
urged by the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal to establish a system
of storm warnings, and the Secretary of State, about the same time,
recommended the record of meteorological data in connection with
the suggestions and requirements of the Sanitary Commission.          To
the latter body the whole question of meteorological          enquiry in
India was referred, and in accordance with their recommendations,
provincial meteorological     systems were established in the Punjab
and North-West Provinces in 1865, in Madras in 1866, and in Bengal
in 1867. These systems were, however, quite independent of each
other, and the opportunity of establishing a controlling authority, so
emphatically urged by General Strachey and the Calcutta Com
mittee, was postponed for several years.
   An account of the Calcutta cyclone of 1864 was drawn up by
Colonel Gastrell and Mr. Blanford, and was published by order of the

                                      XV
Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal in 1866. It gave a very full descrip
tion of all the more important features of that cyclone, and, consider
ing the unsatisfactory character of a large portion of the data, is
remarkably complete.        The conclusions based on the data and on the
investigations of Piddington show a thoroughly clear grasp of the
subject, and are, in almost every respect, in agreement with the
results of later investigation on storm genesis and motion in India.
   Soon after the Calcutta cyclone, at the instance of the Lieutenant-
 Governor, a Committee, of which -Mr. Blanford was the secretary,
was appointed to arrange a system of storm- warnings for the port of
Calcutta. Observatories        were established at a number of coast
stations, and the observations made were telegraphed to Calcutta daily.
The Bengal Provincial Meteorological Department was founded in
1867 for the combination of general meteorological observations with
the continuation of this system of storm-warnings, and Mr. Blanford
became Meteorological Reporter for Bengal, still retaining his
Professorship, and lecturing, chiefly on chemistry and physics, in tho
Presidency College.       The new Meteorological Department of Bengal
at once took a very high position, and became known for the
accuracy of its data and the thoroughness             of its work, and the
annual reports on the meteorology            of Bengal, prepared by Mr.
Blanford, increased in importance from year to year.                 He also,
during the eight years that he held the post, published a series of
meteorological papers in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.'
                                 '
Of these the most important were " On certain protracted irregu
larities of Atmospheric Pressure in Bengal in relation to the Monsoon
           "                                                         " On the
Rainfall     (' Jour. As. Soc. Bengal,' vol. 39, Part 2, p. 123) ;
                               "                      "
Normal Rainfall of Bengal (to., p. 243) ; and           On some recent Evi
dence of the Variation of the Sun's Heat" (' J.A.S.B.,' vol.44, Part 2,
p. 21).    The first of these papers directed attention to one of the
wore important features of Indian meteorology, and, probably, of
tropical meteorology in general, the frequent persistency of abnormal
variations of pressure over large areas in India for periods varying in
length from a few months to two or three years, and the connexion
between such prolonged abnormal features and large modifications in
the distribution of rainfall. This was a subject which occupied much
of Mr. Blanford's thoughts, and it is increasing in importance in con
nexion with the forecasting of the general character of the monsoon
rains, now performed by the Indian Meteorological Department.
   During the same period he contributed two papers, one " On the
                        "
Origin of a Cyclone (' Proc. Roy. Soc.,' vol. 17, 1869, p. 472), the
other on " The Wiuds of Northern India
                                                "
                                                   (' Phil. Trans.,* vol. 166,
p. 563),  to the  Royal Society.    In   the  second   paper he utilised the
data collected by the Meteorological Departments of Bengal, the
North-Western Provinces, and the Punjab, in order to describe the

                                     Xv'l
chief features of the normal air-currents over Northern India, and to
trace out their origin and causes, so far as they could be discovered,
in the local physical changes of the atmosphere.     The broad features
were skilfully worked out, and the relations of the north-east and
south-west monsoon currents to each other, and to the temperature
and other conditions of India, clearly shown.      This paper was parti
cularly interesting. Not only was it the first attempt to discuss this
important question by the aid of fairly accnrate data, but it was also
the first essay on Indian meteorology as a whole, and the subject was
for the first time treated as a problem of dynamic meteorology, and
recent extensions of knowledge in the physical sciences utilised in the
discussion of the various problems.
    Shortly after the publication of this important paper the Govern
ment of India came to the conclusion that the provincial system with
out a central controlling authority was unsatisfactory and ineffective,
and it was determined to constitute a centralised department on the
lines laid down as essential by General Strachey some years pre
viously. Mr. Blanford was, in 1874, in consequence of this change
 of system, transferred from the Educational Staff of Bengal, and
 appointed head of the new department.        He was called upon, at the
time of his appointment, to prepare a scheme for the reorganisation
 of the provincial meteorological systems and their consolidation into
 an imperial system, with himself, the Meteorological Reporter to the
 Government of India, as central controlling authority.
    In the scheme drawn up, Mr. Blanford sketched first the general
 principles on which meteorological       work should be carried out in
 India, and also made proposals for the extension of the work of
 observation and for the centralisation of the Department, in order to
 secure uniformity of methods and tabulation of the results. He also
 proposed the commencement of special series of observations to throw
 light on the regular diurnal and annual meteorological changes in
 India.    The scheme was approved in its entirety, and brought into
 operation in the year 1875. It has stood the test of time thoroughly,
 and the Department has developed during the eighteen years of its
 existence in the directions fully anticipated by Mr. Blanford.
     One of the first important labours of the Meteorological Reporter to
 the Government of India was to write the ' Indian Meteorologist's Vade
  Mecum.' This was primarily intended to inform the observers at Indian
  observatories what and how they were to observe, in order that their
 observations might be accurate and useful.     This portion of the work
 forms Part I of the ' Vade Mecum.' In order to arouse an intelligent
  interest in their work, Mr. Blanford, in Part IT, gave an interesting
  account of all the more important features of Indian meteorology so
  far as then known, together with explanations based on the data and
                                                                     '
  ideas of recent advances in physical science.   The ' Vade Mecum at

                                       XV11
once   became a useful book of reference for Indian observers, and
was practically the first treatise which placed the ideas of the modern
school of dynamical meteorology in an easily accessible form before
ordinary readers.      It  was for many years the best treatise on modern
meteorology,    and was the forerunner of the numerous treatises on
the science which        have    been   published  in   the  United   States,
Germany, and England.
   Mr. Blanford was Meteorological Reporter to the Government of
India from 1874 to 1889, bnt during the last two years he was on
furlough.      During this period he wrote a number of short and

Theory of the Winter Rains of Northern India
Part 2, p. 1 ; 1884), and a series of papers on the " Diurnal Oscilla

    During the same period he wrote a very important short paper for
 the Royal Society " On the Connection of the Himalaya Snowfall
with Dry Winds and Seasons of Drought in India " (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,'
vol. 37, 1884, p. 3).       In this he dealt with a remarkable feature of
Indian meteorology, viz., the effect of abnormally heavy snowfall in
the Himalayan area in modifying the pressure and temperature con
 ditions over Northern India daring the hot weather, and hence the
 distribution of rainfall during the following south-west monsoon.
 He was the first to realise fully the importance in Indian meteorology
 of this factor which has become the basis for the seasonal forecasts
now issued by the Indian Meteorological Department.
    His most important work at this time was undoubtedly the series
 of annual reports on the meteorology of India (from 1876 to 1885)
 that he wrote, and the papers he contributed to the ' Indian Meteoro
 logical Memoirs,' which publicatiori he initiated shortly after the
 establishment of the Indian Meteorological Department.
    The subjects of these papers show how largely his mind was
 occupied with the regular diurnal and annual meteorological changes
 in India. He considered a full knowledge of these matters of primary
 importance in the present stage of our knowledge, and that their
 solution would throw valuable light on some of the most important
 abnormal features of Indian meteorology and might furnish a key
 for the explanation of these featnres.
    His last and most important work of investigation was the mono
 graph on
             "
               The Rainfall of India " (' Indian Meteorological Memoirs,'
     vol. liv.                                                        c

                                   XV111
 vol. 3).   It was the outcome of the labour of several years.      All the
 available data were obtained and sifted to separate the doubtful from
 the trustworthy.     The result of this investigation was to give an
 accurate   knowledge of all the broader features of the distribution of
 the rainfall of India, and of the chief causes or factors (physical and
 topographical) determining the law of its distribution.
    After he retired on pension in 1889 he continued to devote himself
 with unwearied zeal amidst failing health to the discussion of his
 favourite meteorological problems.      He undertook the discussion of
 the series of hourly observations taken at about twenty-five stations
 in India from 1876 to 1888.     He completed the discussion of those
 taken at Sibsagar, Dhubri, Goal para, Hazaribagh, Patna, Roorkee,
 and Allahabad, but was obliged to give up the work in the beginning
 of 1892. It was his intention to have prepared separate statements
 and brief discussions of the results for each station, and to have
 followed this up with a general discussion of the whole of the results,
 and it is greatly to be regretted in the interests of meteorological
 science that he was not spared to complete this work on a subject to
 which he had devoted especial attention, and which he was especially
 qualified to investigate.
    He presented the chief results of his investigations and those of his
 co-workers in India to the English public in 1889, shortly before his
 death, in his ' Climates and Weather of India.'     It is a valuable work
 of local climatology, and presents all the more important results of
 the work of the Meteorological Department dnring his regime in an
 interesting form for English readers.
    It will thus be seen that his life was one of unwearied activity.
 His powers of organisation were shown by the steady development of
 the department which he established and initiated. He was a patient
 and vigorous worker, and the results of his labours are shown as
 much by the numerous short suggestive papers he contributed to
 various Societies, &c, as by his larger monograph ' On the Rainfall
 of India,' and the Annual Reports on the Meteorology of India.
 His name will be associated with the commencement and develop
 ment of scientific meteorology in India, and the rapid growth of
 the department under him is the best proof of his special qualifica
 tions as a meteorologist and of his zeal and untiring energy.        Euro
 pean meteorologists recognised almost from     the first the  value of the
 work done by the department under him ; it was his constant aim
 to place his department upon as high a level for scientific and prac
 tical work in meteorology as similar departments in Europe and
 America, and it is hardly too much to say that he fully succeeded.
    After he became engaged in the work of Indian meteorology, Mr.
 Blanford's time was almost entirely occupied with that subject,
 although he by no means lost his interest in geology and zoology.

His only important contribution to Indian geology after he left the
Indian Survey, was a paper published by tbe Geological Society in
        '
1875,     On the Age and Correlation of the Plant-bearing         Series of
India and the former existence of an Indo-Oceanic Continent.' He
also contributed a few short papers to Indian scientific societies on
land and fresh-water mollusca and on ferns.        He was the author of
two treatises on the geography of India, one of which has now for
many years been used as a text-book in Indian schools and colleges,
and the other, a recent publication, forms one of Macmillan's geo
graphical series. Mr. Blanford married, in 1867, the daughter of
Mr. G. F. Cockburn, of the Bengal Civil Service, and leaves a
widow, one son, an officer in the Royal Artillery, and three daughters.
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1880, and was
President of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1884-85.          His health
had been precarious for some time before ho retired from the Indian
Service, and he died of cancer at Folkestone, where he had resided
after bis return to England, on the 23rd January of the present
year.                                                          W. T. B.
   Dr. William Charles Henry was born in Manchester, March 31,
1804. His father and grandfather were both Fellows of this Society,
and both distinguished chemists.       He was educated at various schools,
and matriculated at Edinburgh University in November, 1824.              In
1827 he graduated M.D., the subject of his graduation thesis being
" De Tuberculorum Origine," and in the following winter studied in
the Paris hospitals, attending as well the lectures at the Sorbonne.
From 1828 to 1835 he was physician to the Manchester Royal In
firmary, but resigned this post in order to continue his chemical
studies.     He studied at Berlin and Giessen, and afterwards returned
to Manchester.       Leaving Manchester about 1842, he took up his re
sidence at Ledbury and remained thei'e until his death on January 7,
1892.
   Dr. Henry was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1834; he
was also a Fellow of the Chemical and Geological Societies, and a
Corresponding Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Turin.
He was the author of papers
