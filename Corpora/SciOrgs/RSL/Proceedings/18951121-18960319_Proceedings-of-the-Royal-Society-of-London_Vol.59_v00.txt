                                 Prof.  J.  N. Lockyer.                   [Nov. 21,
      The wave-lengths of these lines have been determined by means of
   a Steinheil spectroscope having fonr prisms, comparisons being made
   with adjacent metallic lines, and the positions interpolated by micro-
  metric     measurements      ;  the accuracy may perhaps be taken to be
   within 0'l tenth metre. Other lines have been noted, but they are
  not included in the list, for the reason that their wave-lengths have
   not yet been determined with the dispersion stated above.
      Of the lines in the foregoing list, six are in all probability coinci
  dent with chromospheric lines, as shown in the following table, which
   also indicates the frequencies and brightnesses of the lines according
  to Young : —

            5874 -9 (D3)                 5875 -9                 100         90
            5428-8                       5429-9                     8         3

      It is important to point out that all these lines do not appear in
  the spectrum at the same time. For instance, in the first two speci
  mens of the mineral no trace of D3 was noted, but in the third
  portion examined, all coming from the same specimen, D;) appeared
  as a pretty bright line. Again, as in the case of a previous operation
  on broggerite,* in one experiment with eliasite the products of dis
  tillation, collected in four stages, gave different spectra.
      These facts seem to indicate that the gas obtained from eliasite is
  either a compound or a mixture of gases, just as is that obtained
  from broggerite according to former experiments.
      It is also to be remarked that among the lines in the eliasite
  spectrum, those at 6122-4 and 6065-7 have been recorded in the gases
  obtained from cleveite, and 6122-4 has also been noted in the gas
  obtained from gummite.
      It seems to be more than probable, therefore, that the lines
  observed in eliasite indicate a new gas, in some way associated with
  those given off by cleveite and broggerite, and the fact that D3 is not
  necessarily present in the spectrum, furnishes an additional argu
  ment in favour of the view that the gas obtained from cleveite or
  broggerite is complex.

 1895.]     On the Gases obtained from the Mineral Eliasite.              3
                 Addendum.        Received November 18.
    The results in the foregoing paper depend upon eye observations
on the red end of the spectrum.         Since it was communicated to the
Society the blue end has been investigated photographically.          Many
specimens of eliasite have been distilled, and numerous photographs
of the spectra of the gases given off have been taken.
   The work has been rendered difficult by the very small quantity of
what    I believe to be a new gas, and the large quantity of carbonic
acid, nitrogen, and hydrogen given off from the mineral.          Attempts
have been made to get rid of the known gases, in order to make the
lines of the new gas better visible, and then the amount of gas was
in most cases very small and at times admixed with argon produced
by the sparking.
   The photographs have been measured and reduced, and it is prob
able that the lines, or some of them, which cannot be ascribed to any
known gases, may belong to the same gas as that giving the lines
observed in the rod.       I  append a table of some of these lines, which
suggest possible coincidences in stellar and solar spectra ; the numbers
in brackets indicate the intensities of the lines, 6 being the maximum
in the case of a Cygni, and 10 the maximum in the case of the eclipse
spectrum.

    In addition    to the above    lines there are others with which no
 celestial coincidences have been traced.
    Some of the unknown lines at first noted in the red have been
 observed again in the gases obtained from other specimens ; it is
 important to note that remarkable variations in the spectra have
 been observed in passing from one specimen to another.
    Although the evidence in favour of a new gas is already very
 strong, no final verdict can be given until the spectra of all the
 known gases, including argon, have been photographed at atmospheric
  pressure and the lines tabulated.      This part of the inquiry is well in
  hand.

on the same subject.
   The researches made at Kensington in connection with the new
gases obtained from broggerite and other minerals has consisted, to a
large extent, of comparisons of the lines in their spectra with lines
in the spectra of the sun and stars.     Preliminary accounts of these
comparisons have already     been given, and  they show that the bright
yellow line seen in the gas from broggerite        by no means the only
                                                                   is
important one which appears.
   Although the general distribution and intensities of the lines in
the gases from broggerite and cleveite sufficiently corresponded with
some of the chief " unknown lines

Mr. Fowler and myself, in the absence of the sun, by micrometric
comparisons with the D lines of sodium, the resulting wave-length

on  May 4. The observations were made by Mr. Fowler, in the third
order spectrum of a grating having 14438 lines to the inch, and the
observing telescope was fitted with a high power micrometer eye
piece ; the dispersion was sufficient to easily show the difference of
position of the Ds line on the east and west limbs, due to the sun's rota
tion.   Observations of the chromosphere were therefore confined to
the poles.
    During the short time that the tube retained its great brilliancy,
a faint line, a little less refrangible than the bright yellow one, and
making a close double with it, was readily seen ; but afterwards a
sudden change took place, and the lines almost faded away. While
the gas line was brilliant, it was found to be " the least trace more
refrangible than Di, about the thickness of the line itself, which was
              "
but narrow (' Observatory Note-book            The sudden diminution in
                                               ').
the brightness of the lines made subsequent observations less certain,
but the instrumental conditions being slightly varied,       was thought

that the gas line was probably less refrangible than the D3 line by
about the same amount that the first observation showed           it to be
more refrangible.      Giving the observations equal weight, the gas line
wonld thus appear to be probably coincident with the middle of the
chromospheric line, but         extra weight be given to the first obser
                                 if
vation, made under much more favourable conditions, the gas line
would be slightly more refrangible than the middle of the chromo
sphere line.
    Pressure of other work did not permit the continuation of the
 comparisons.     In the meantime, Runge and Paschen announced*
 that they also had seen the yellow line of the cleveite gas to be a
 close double, neither component having exactly the same wave-length
as D3, according to       Rowland.
     They give the wave-length of the brightest component as 5878'883,
and the distance apart of the lines as 0'323.
  This independent confirmation of the duplicity of the gas line led
me to carefully re-observe the D3 line in the chromosphere for
evidences of doubling.   On June 14 observations were made by
Mr. Shackleton and myself of the D3 line in the 3rd and 4th order
spectra under favourable conditions
                                    " the line was seen best in the

ordinarily seen, and as taken in the comparison of May 4, does not
represent the place of the brightest component of the double line, so
that exact coincidence was not to be expected.
   Though the observations are not yet quite completed, the circum
stance that the line is double in both gas and chromosphere
  pectrnm, in each the less refrangible component being the fainter,
taken in conjunction with the direct comparisons which have been
made, render it highly probable that one of the gases obtained from
cleveite is identical with that which produces the D3 line in the
spectrum of the chromosphere.
   Other observers have since succeeded in resolving the chromo-
spheric line. On June 20, Professor Hale found the line to be clearly
double in the spectrum of a prominence, the less refrangible compo
nent being the fainter, and the distance apart of the lines being
measured as 0-357 tenth-metre.*
   The doubling was noted with much less distinctness in the
6pectrum of the chromosphere itself on June 24. Professor Hale
points out that Rowland's value of the wave-length (as well as that
of 5875'924, determined by himself on June 19 and 20) does not take
account of the fact that the line is a close double.
   Dr. Huggins, after some failures, observed the D3 line to be double
on July 10 ;t he also notes that the less refrangible component was
the fainter, and that the distance apart of the lines was about the
same as that of the lines in the gas from cleveite, according to Runge
and Paschen.
   It may be added, that in addition to appearing in the chromo
sphere, the D3 line has been observed as a bright line in nebulas by
Dr. Copeland, Professor Keeler, and others ; in /3 Lyrae and other
bright line stars ; and as a dark line in such stars as Bellatrix, by
Mr. Fowler, Professor Campbell, and Professor Keeler. In all these
cases it is associated with other lines, which, as          I  shall show pre
sently,  are associated  with   it in the  spectra  of the new gases.
   Tits Blue line, X.4471*8. — A provisional determination on April 2 of
the wave-length of a bright blue line, seen in the spectrum of the
gases obtained from a specimen of cleveite, showed that it approxi
mated very closely to a chromospheric line, the frequency of which is
stated as 100 by Young.
   This line was also seen very brilliantly in the tube supplied to me
by Professor Ramsay on May 1, and on May 6 it was compared
directly with the chromosphere line by Mr. Fowler.                 The second
order grating spectrum was employed.                The observations in this
region  were  not  so easy as  in  the  case  of  Da,  but with the dispersion
employed, the gas line was found to be coincident with the chromo-

    In a former note,* have pointed out that this line does not appear
in the spectra of the gases obtained from all minerals which give the
yellow line.
    Besides appearing in the spectrum of the chromosphere, the line in
question is one of the first importance in the spectra of nebulae, bright
line stars, and of the white stars such as Bellatrix and Rigel.
    The Infra-red Line, X 7065-5. — In addition to D3 and the line at
44i71*8, there is a chromospheric line in the infra-red which also has
a frequency of 100, according to Young.             On May 28, 1 communicated
a note to the Royal Society stating that this line had been observed
in the spectrum of the gases obtained from broggerite and euxenite,t
solar comparisons having convinced me that the wave-length of the
gas line corresponded with that given by Young ; and                I added " it
follows, therefore, that besides the hydrogen lines, all three chromo
spheric lines in Young's list which have a frequency of 100 have
now been recorded in the spectra of the new gas or gases obtained
from minerals by the distillation method."
    M. Deslandres, of the Paris Observatory, has also observed the line
at 7065 in the gas obtained from cleveite.J
     Other Lines. — Determinations of the wave-lengths of many other
lines in the spectra of the new gases have been made, chiefly with
the aid of 'a Steinheil spectroscope having four prisms, and the results
leave little doubt as to the coincidence of several lines with those
appearing in the chromosphere, nebulae, and white stars.
    It seems very probable, also, that many lines which have been noted,
and for which no origins have yet been traced, belong to gases which
have not hitherto been recorded in the chromosphere.
    The following table summarises the chief lines which have so far
been recorded in the new gases from various minerals, some of which
 show D3 while others do not. Only those lines which also appear in
the spectrum of the chromosphere, nebulae, or Orion stars, are given
 in the first instance. There are other lines which are probably also
 associated   with chromospheric ones, but further investigation of
 them is considered desirable before they are included in the list.
     The first column of the table gives the wave-lengths of the lines on
 Rowland's scale, while the second gives the wave-lengths on Ang
 strom's scale ; the third gives the frequency of the lines in the
 chromosphere according to Young. In the fourth column lines photo
 graphed with the prismatic camera during the total eclipse of April
  16, 1893, are shown ; these have been included because in some cases

                                    (Abstract.)
    In  the first part of this paper the author gives the results of her
microscopic investigations on the structure of the skeleton in a
number of typical Madreporaria.
    Detailed microscopic study of the surface of the septum showed
small scales lying above and against one another somewhat like
the slates of a roof, and consisting solely of fine, parallel-placed,
or diverging, aragonite fibres. Besides these calcareous scales, ecto
dermal cells (cali ooblasts) could still be observed in several cases,
attached to the surfaces of septa in fresh specimens.                Heider and
 one or two other authors have already mentioned the frequent occur
 rence of organic polypal remnants on skeletal surfaces.
    The scales observed by the author were found to agree precisely in
 shape ar.c. faize with the calicoblasts, and to show various transitional
 stages from the organic cell to the calcified.            It follows from this
 that the skeleton of Madreporaria takes its origin from an actual
 calcification of the calicoblasts, and not, as Koch thought, by a secre
 tion laid down outside the cells. The author found further that the
 calcareous scales were arranged in extremely thin lamellae, and that
 the fibro-crystalline    deposit was similarly oriented in successive
 lamellae.
    The stages in the process of skeleton building may be thns gener
 ally stated : —
    (1) Calcareous deposit is laid down within individual calicoblasts
 of the ectoderm. At the same time new ectodermal cells are formed
 next the mesoglcea, and these which are undergoing calcification
 become loose external layers of partly calcareous,              partly organic
 tissue.
    (2) Fibro-crystalline groups of aragonite are built up in the indi
 vidual cells, and the cell-walls shrivel.        Thus a connected calcareous
 lamella is formed, which is ultimately                incorporated with the
 skeleton.

    (3) Changes of disintegration and crystallisation still continue
after the cell lamella has severed living contact with the polyp. The
disintegration of organic cell-remnants produces various flecks and
bands, usually carbonaceous, in the midst of the crystalline deposit.
These afford the explanation of the so-called " dark streaks and other
                                                               "
appearances in the skeleton.
   The finer structure of the septa will be readily understood when it
is remembered that the septa are formed within radial invaginations
of the aboral body-wall of the polyp. The septal surfaces are prac
tically casts of the two flaps of a septal invagination.        When the
flaps are smooth, the calcareous       lamella   are  also  smooth. But,
according to the author's observations, that is seldom the case in
decent Madreporaria. Usually the septal flaps are pitted and goffered,
resembling the pleated muscular flaps of the mesenteries, and the
septal surfaces are correspondingly granulated and fluted. The author
has found that in all cases the calcified calicoblasts of successive
lamellae are grouped around definite centres of deposit situated in the
median plane — corresponding to the growing edge — of the septum.
Subsequently the individual groups of calicoblasts assume the form
of radiating bunches of fibro-crystalline aragonite, passing outwards
from the original centre of deposit in the median plane to the sur
face of the septum.      The author has given the name of " fascicles "
to these fibro-crystalline " bunches," and has demonstrated the re
lation which they bear to the external sculpturing observed on lateral
septal surfaces.    The emergence of a fascicle at the surface gives rise to
a granulation. The fascicles are, however, of varied size ; if large, one
fascicle usually corresponds to one granulation ; if small, a number
of fascicles may in the course of septal thickening coalesce to form
a broad nodular granulation.     The size of individual fascicles depends
on the original closeness of the " centres of calcification " at the
septal edges.
    The trabecula (= "poutrelle" Edwi and H.) of a "perforate"
septum is composed of symmetrical groups of fascicles placed in vertical
series.   The author has further found that those septa described by
Edwards and Haime as " imperforate and leaf- like " are also composed
of trabeculae.   But the individual parts of these trabecules have an
opposite pair of fascicles instead of an indefinite number.             The
majority    of  Astraeid  genera   have  septa  in  which both kinds of
trabeculae occur.    The anthor applies the term " simple trabecula "
 to a trabecula made up of successive pairs of fascicles, as the axis of
 deposit is in part or wholly common to the opposite fascicles ; and
the term " compound trabecula " to one made up of successive groups
of fascicles. In the former case the fibro-crystalline deposit may
be said to be bilaterally symmetrical in the opposite halves of a
septum ; in the latter the fibro-crystalline deposit is radially symme

trical around ideal trabecular axes in the median septal plane. Each
member of a successive series of fascicle " pairs " or " groups " in
a trabecula is called by the author a trabecular part (Trabekelglied) .
TJie " fascicle " may be regarded as the structural unit of the coral
skeleton. Two or more fascicles combine to build up a " trabecular part.'"
And the differences in the relative arrangement of trabecular parts deter
mine the endless varieties of skeletal form within the Madreporaria.
   The author has subjected the following typical genera to a detailed
microscopic investigation : — Galaxea, Mussa, Heliastraea, Goniastraea,
Montlivaltia, Thecosmilia ; then Fnngia, Siderastraea, Lophoseris ;
further, Eupsammia, Haplaraea ; and, lastly, Turbinaria, Actinacis,
Madrepora, and Porites.       This research enables the author to state
that different types of septal structure are characteristic of different
groups of Madreporaria.      The differences relate to the microscopic
structure of the trabecules and to the arrangement of trabe
culae   in the plane of a septum.           It is impossible here to
do more than indicate the line of research.             Turbinaria is an
example of an extremely simple structural type. The component
trabeculae are small, uniform in size, and directed all in the same
way, obliquely or almost horizontally inwards from the periphery of
the septum to the inner edge.        The fascicles are paired, and their
axes never bend out of the median septal plane.            Galaxea has a
septum whose trabecules bend right and left from a definite area of
divergence in the septal plane.      The individual trabeculae are large,
vary in size, and the axes of the paired fascicles bend out of the
median plane towards the opposite surfaces of a septum.                 The
septum of Mussa is composed of a number of broad ridges, elliptical in
 section, and ending at the upper edge of the septum in broad "spini-
form teeth."     The author shows that each " spiniform tooth
                                                                 " is itself
finely serrated, and that the serrae represent apices of trabeculae.     In
short, a single broad ridge of the Mussa septum is the precise homologue
of the complete Galaxea septum, being built up of fan-shaped groups
of trabeculae diverging right and left from the middle area of a ridge.
Again, Fungia has, like Mussa, a septum composed of a number of
ridges, but the trabeculae in each ridge have a course almost parallel
with one another. The emergent fascicles are thus so close that
coalescence inevitably takes place; the soft parts of the polyp
clothing the ridge are pushed outwards at the prominent middle
part of the ridge, and readily give rise to synapticular union between
septa.    Further reference to this part of the work must be omitted
 here.
    The author observed in sections of recent types that a larger
 amount of organic cell-material was usually present near the
 median plane of the septum than towards the lateral surfaces.         This
 she believes may be attributed to the greater rapidity of the calca

reons secretion and the less complete calcification    of the calicoblasts
present at the doubled upper edges of septal invaginations.       In fossil
material, secondary changes render this central part of the septum
more or less conspicuous on account of the breaking down of organic
products, or sometimes the complete replacement by infiltrated salts.
The author strongly contends that there is no basis for the assump -
tion of a "primary septum" in the middle plane of a septum in the
sense at present accepted by most palaeontologists.      On the contrary,
the author's sections show that the fibro-crystalline structure of the
septum is the same throughout its whole thickness, essentially that of a
double system of thin calcareous lamellae, either smooth or fluted, and
corresponding to a deposit from opposite flaps of an invagination.
   The author's investigations afford many new microscopic facts of
structure testifying that the growth in height of the polyp is accom
plished at certain growth-periods, between which pauses ensue.
During each growth-period a varying number of the calcareous
lamellae, " growth lamellae," are laid down, and these always appear
in intimate union with one another. Again, regular curves or lines
of growth are evident on the septal surfaces, marking the intervals
between successive growth-periods.     The space between two growth-
curves or lines on the septal surface represents the part of the septum
built up in one growth-period, and it has been called by the author a
septal growth-segment.     An important observation is that the extra
length added to a single trabecula in one growth-period is invariably
one trabecular part ; this length varies in the trabeculae of one and the
same septum, being greatest at the exsert portions near the wall.
   Granulations mark the surfaces of trabecular parts. Edwards and
Haime applied the term " synapticula " to the interseptal bars in
Fungia and its allies, and described the synapticula as formed by
coalescence of granulations from opposite surfaces of neighbouring
septa.   The author demonstrates that in Fungia the granulations
seldom meet across interseptal loculi.     But a continuous calcareous
deposit is formed in a special invagination of the interseptal parts of
the aboral body-wall.     Together with a number of observations on
other synapticulate types, this has led the author to accept a distinc
tion made by Pratz, and hitherto discredited in the literature.
 Pratz proved that the fossil Fungid subfamily of Thamnastraeinae
had synapticulae formed by coalescence of granulations, and these he
                                                                      "
called "psettdosynapticulae."    The name of " true synapticulae        ho
limited to such as were formed around new centres of deposit out of
the septal plane ; these he found in Siderastraea, but did not farther
examine typical genera belonging to the families Funginae and Lop-
hoserinae.   The author's results are that pseudosynapticulce occur not
only in Thamnastroainae, but also in the Funginae, Lophoserinae, and
 occasionally in Astraeidae and Eupsammidae.      While true synapticulae

occur chiefly in Funginae and Eupsammidae, rarely in Lophoserinae,
and never in Astraeidae. The author regards true synapticulae as
basal structures representing modified dissepiments.          The advantage
of synapticulae to the polyp is that they afford a basal support over
which the fleshy parts and mesenterial loculi may bend and be con-
tinned to some depth. The author, in pointing this out, refers to the
analogy of the internal canaliculate visceral system thus produced
with the external canaliculate system attained by a porous ccenen-
            "
chyme in Perforate
                           " colonies. At the
                                                 same time she thoroughly
disagrees with the prevailing opinion that the synapticulate types
have any nearer relationship with Madrepora, Porites, &c., since the
skeletal parts show many important differences of structure ; neither
is the " porous cceuenchyme
                                    " in
                                         any way homologous with the syn
apticulate calyx.
    No essential difference is presented between septa, costae, and wall
in respect of their microscopic structure, and the author found it also
for other reasons practical to distinguish in her work the septa and
costae under the inclusive name of        radial structures, the wall, on the
other hand, as a tangential structure.           Dissepiments, tabulae, true
synapticulae, and certain kinds of columella are regarded as basal
struntures.
    The microscopic structure of dissepiments and tabulat is demonstrated
 by the author to be the same. Both are composed of a series of cal
careous growth-lamellae laid down from one surface only of the aboral
 body-wall of the polyp. The fibro-crystalline deposit is therefore
 perpendicular to the plane of contact between polyp and skeleton.
 The distance from one platform of dissepiments to the next above
 coincides in all typical Astraeids with the interval between two
 growth-lines on the septal surface. It may be deduced from this that
 the polyp lays down a new basal support for itself at the close of
 each growth- period. The solid calcareous deposit (usually called
 " stereoplasm " or
                         "endotheca") at the base of the short, simple
 calyces of most Turbinolids, has the same microscopic structure as
 tabuiae or dissepiments, differing from them only in the fact that the
 new groups of growth-lamellae are always closely opposed to the fore
 going.
    The " columellar " or " pseudocollumellar " area of recent Madre-
 poraria is explained by the author as the morphological equivalent of
 the '' tabulate " area in most Palaeozoic Madreporaria.        The styliform
                  "
 or fasciculate true      "  columella of Turbinolia and its allies proves
 itself to be, structurally considered, a basal deposit, and is merely an
 upwardly arched or entwined modification of the tabulae.                  Tho

literature in the use of the terms " theca and " epitheca." The
author accepts Heider and Ortmann's terms " pseudotheca
                                                             " for a wall
formed by lateral thickening of the septa, and " eutheca," or simply
theca, for a wall in which independent centres of deposit are de
veloped. Ortmann's suborders of Madreporaria, Euthecalia, Pseudo-
thecalia, Athecalia are, however, believed by the author to be based on
an erroneous principle, since all types with a porous wall are placed
among Athecalia. Porosity is looked upon by the author as a secondary
feature, the porous wall can be demonstrated to be the morpho
logical equivalent either of pseudotheca or of eutheca.      A still more
serious objection to these suborders is the fact that not all Turbino-
lids possess an eutheca; neither do all Astraeids possess a pseudo
theca as Ortmann means, but cases occur in both those families
where the only peripheral support is afforded by the epitheca. The
author is inclined to think this was the primitive form of the Madre
porarian calyx, and to look upon both theca and pseudotheca as later
modifications associated with retrogression of the epitheca, greater
prominence and rapid growth of the septa, and very often with the
processes of vegetative budding.
    Certain ccenenchymatous     colonies, Madrepora,    Turbinaria, &c.,
have been shown by the author to have thecal and septal structure
like the Turbinolids ; further absence of basal structures in the calyx
other than columella.     This throws a new light on the relationship
of these types and brings them along with the Oculinidae and Pocillo-
poridae into a very natural affinity with the Tnrbinolidae.           The
coenenchyme of these colonies is treated by the author as an elabora
tion of a primitive extracalycinal deposit around individual polyps.
Bourne in one of his papers suggests the possibility of coenenchyme
 being epithecate in certain of these types.
    In order to elucidate the " costate " portions of Astraeid and
Fungid colonies, the author demonstrates the exact homology of
skeletal parts in the calyces of ancient Cyathophyllids and of recent
Astraeids and Pungids.     The pseudotheca which appeared in Acervu-
laria and  other  Cyathophyllid types marked out an inner from an
outer area of the calyx and septa.     The exact counterpart of this is
found in the type-genus of the Astrssidae, Heliastraea. In       it, how
 ever, only the inner part   called calyx, while the outer area
                            is                                 is  spoken
of as a " costate" — extracalicinal — area.    It is on this outer area

that the so-called " Randplatte " (which the author translates as " edge-
zone ") is supported in the living polyp, and the author takes it that
the typical edge-zone has mesenteries and mesenterial loculi simply
because it was originally an inherent part of the polyp.       It is clear
that such costate parts in Astneid colonies have an entirely different
evolutionary history from the coenenchyme in the Pocilloporidae, &c.,
where no edge-zone surrounds the polyp. The author traces back
this difference in recent colonial types to a difference already well-
marked in Silurian Madreporaria — viz., the difference between the
calyces of a typical Cyathophyllid and a typical Zaphrentid respec
tively. In the former a broad calycinal outer zone with dissepi-
mental base surrounds an inner tabulate area ; in the latter there
is no such outer zone or the very slightest indication of it.
   The author found that the families of Edward and Haime's classi
fication must undergo considerable changes ; she limits herself here
to one or two of the most important changes suggested by her on the
basis of microscopic septal structure and generally of the morphology
of the skeleton.     The family of Astneidw E. H. hitherto included
two main subfamilies, the Astrosina) and Eusmilinae.         The former
is made by the author the sole representative of Astriciiln?, while the
latter is entirely broken up. The genera Trochosmilia, Placosmilia,
and their allies are referred to the family of Turbinolid® ; the genera
Rhipidogyra, Pectinia, Dendrogyra, Euphyllia, and a large numbei
of fossil genera are placed in a new family Amphiastraeidae erected
by the author. The Mesozoic representatives of this new family
are proved to be direct colony -building descendants of Palaeozoici
Zaphrentids, while the Turbinolidae are looked upon as simple corals
descended from the same Palaeozoic family.       The Stylina group of
Eusmilinae E. H. are placed in the neighbourhood of the Astraeida
and Amphiastroidae as an intermediate family Stylinidae. Galaxea
is regarded as a near ally of the Stylinidae ; in spite of its somewhat
aberrant features the author ranks it provisionally within this
family.
   Edwards and Haime's group of Madreporaria           Perforata is also
 broken up by the author. The Eupsammidae show uudoubted affinity
 -with the Fungidae, and both these families, together with tho
 Astraeidae and Stylinidae, are shown to have derived their structural
 features from leading Palaeozoic types belonging to the family of
 Cyathophyllidae.    In all of them the septum reaches a high degree
 of differentiation in its trabecular structure, on lines already intro
 duced in various of the more advanced Palaeozoic types.               The
 MadreporidoB (Turbinarinae    E. H. and Madreporinae  E. H.)   are placed
 in the neighbourhood of Pocilloporidae and Oculinidae; their simple
 septal structure agrees with the primitive types of septum presented
 by Palaeozoic Zaphrentids and their allies. The Poritidai, although

16     Miss M. M. Ogilvie.         Microscopic and Systematic       [Nov. 21,
having certain features in common with the Madreporidae, differ
essentially in septal structure, and are regarded as a group of
Madreporaria which branched off at a very early age from the main
ancestral stem of Zaphrentidae, and followed an independent line
of development.
    The author's results hear inevitably to the conclusion that the
suborder Madreporaria         Rngosa erected by Edwards and Haime
draws an entirely artificial barrier between Palaeozoic Madreporaria
and the younger suborders M. Aporosaand Perforata Ed. and H. In
the second part of the present paper the author annuls all three sub
orders and follows out the evolution of Madreporaria in the light of
the general morphological results arrived at in the first part of the
           Haeckel's terms of " Tetracoralla
                                                   " for the M. Rngosa and
paper.
Hexacoralla for the M. Aporosa and Perforata only gave a stronger
expression to Edwards and Haime's convention of tetrameral and
hexameral symmetry of the septa.              And although several authors
have from time     to time  pointed     out the inappropriateness of erecting
subdivisions on the feature of septal symmetry, nothing farther has
been done.      Even now, in current literature, one may find the term
Bugosa    =   Tetracoralla   set in contradistinction     to Madreporaria =
Hexacoralla !
    From the standpoint attained by her own investigations, the
 author then traces the series of changes which appeared within the
 group of Madreporaria during the course of the geologic ages. Some
 of the more important and general of these evolutionary changes may
be shortly enumerated : —
    (1) Tahulm became modified centrally as columella and pseudo-
 columella, more seldom became vesicular.
     (2) Instead of one to four basal pits (fossulal) for the reception of
 specialised reproductive mesenterial filaments, the whole base of the
 calyx became deepened, usually around the axial columella or pseudo-
 columella.
     (3) Septa became more prominent and exsert in growth ; their
 structure became more elaborate, their surfaces fluted and richly
 granulated, their edges knobbed, toothed, serrated, spined.
               " rugose              "
     (4) The              epitheca       became tardy in growth, and was
 Teplaced functionally by      a  theca or pseudotheca.
     (5)  Vegetative   increase    was facilitated by the specialization of an
  "            " around the                                    " costato " por
    edge-zone                    polyp (represented by the
 tion of a calyx, or its ancient homologue, the peripheral " dissepi-
 mental zone" of Cyathophyllids).
                                     " of
     (6) The "pinnate insertion             septa demonstrated by Kunth in
 primitive corals became gradually a feature of embryonic calyces, and
 then vanished. But the embryonic mesenteries appear in recent

                                                      septa did in the mature

calyces of primitive types.              The disappearance of " pinnate inser
        " as a
tion              generic feature did not necessarily entail the abandon
ment of a tetrameral, more properly said, bilateral, arrangement of
the septa.        It  induced mainly the hastening of septal insertion, the
relative     position being often retained, even in adult forms.*            Again,
many recent types said to have radial symmetry of septa in adalt
calyces       have well-marked           bilateral symmetry in the young in
dividual.
    All the above changes indicate, in the author's opinion, merely
various lines of adaptivity, correlative with one great, leading change
in the living polyp : — an increase in the number of gonad-bearing
mesenteries and in the musculature of the mesenteries, resulting in im
proved powers        of self-preservation     and of reproduction.
     The evolution of recent Madreporarian families from primitive
types hinges round the gradual incoming of that main change.                    The
general law of the hastening of the developmental stages in the
individual worked with this change, and the pinnate insertion of
septal pairs became more and more modified to a cyclical system
 of insertion.        The author points out in favour of this view how the
 untoward circumstances for coral existence which prevailed in Europe
 during the Upper Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic, and Liassic
 ages, may have given a widespread impulse towards the carrying out
 and confirmation of the main evolutionary change as above stated.
 The change, however, has been ever since in progress. The author
 traces its constant working within the family of Astraeidae, its
 influence on Eupsammidae and Oculinidae, and so on.
     There is therefore, in the author's opinion, no greater fallacy than
 the idea that some universal change took place amongst Madre-
 poraria at the end of Palaeozoic time and before the Mid-Triassic era.
  One and the same line of evolution may be detected making its way
  in the group of Madreporaria.              Precocity in advance was shown by
  the Palaeozoic        Cyathophyllids,       hence   the high differentiation of
  Astraeids, Eupsammids, and Fungids as early as Mesozoic ages.                  On
  the other hand, the Palaeozoic Zaphrentids and their descendants in
  Mesozoic times were remarkably backward in advance, and it is
   among their recent representatives that primitive structures and
  forms are chiefly upheld.              Naturally retrogression and atavism is
  shown in various degree in all families, in none more so than in
  the Turbinolids, the family most closely allied with the ancient
  Zaphrentids.

            George J. Burch, M.A.                   Communicated by Professor
            B. Price. F.R.S. Received June 24, 1895.
      In my papers* " On          a Method of Determining          the value of Rapid
   Variations of a Difference of Potential," and                 " On the Time-Rela
   tions of the Capillary Electrometer," I showed that the photographic
   record of an excursion of the capillary electrometer indicates electro
   motive changes not only qualitatively but quantitatively, even when
   they last too short a time for the movements of the meniscus to be
   completed.
      The movement of the mercury commences simultaneously with the
   communication to it of the E.M.P., and ceases the instant it is with
   drawn, the velocity of the meniscus at any instant being proportional
   to the difference between the P.D. of the source and the P.D. of the
   charge in the electrometer. For the sake of brevity, this difference
   will be referred to as the Acting P.D.
       I showed that if an excursion is recorded in the form of a curve, of
    which the abscissae are proportional to the times and the ordinates to
    the acting P.D.'s, the acting P.D. at any instant is given immediately
    by the tangent to the curve at that point ; and the method of analysis
    set forth in my papers was based on the determination of the tangent
    or its equivalent.
       Since then the process has been applied to several hundred photo
    graphs, most of which were taken during the research on the
    electrical phenomena of muscle and nerve in which                    I  have assisted

upon this slit, so that the movements of the meniscus are recorded
in a polar curve in which time is measured by the angular displace
ment, and the position of the mercury by the radius vector.
   In such a curve, the total indicated E.M.F. is made up of two
parts, viz. : —
    (A) A. part indicated by the distance the meniscus has moved
from its zero position.     This corresponds to the scale readings of the
instrument, as used for measuring a steady difference of potential.
    (B) A part indicated by the velocity with which the meniscus is
moving.     This is proportional to the polar sub-normal to the curve,
which can be easily measured.
    The algebraic sum of these two parts represents the total P.D. of
the source at that instant.        By repeating the process for a number
of points on the curve, a derived curve can be drawn showing the
actual variations of the E.M.F. during the passage of the plate.
    Considered as a practical means of measuring electromotive
changes of short duration, the method set forth in my paper is opeu
 to one grave objection.*        It assumes that the time relations of the
apparatus employed correspond to the formula
                                    r =    ae~ce-
To expect the maker of the electrometer to guarantee this would
greatly enhance the cost of an instrument necessarily fragile, and it
would be equally fatal to the general adoption of the method if the
experimenter had to go through a tedioas series of measurements
 with each new capillary.
    The process of calibration which I am about to describe is a
 general one, applicable to all kinds of dead-beat instruments of
which the excursions can be recorded in polar curves, and by an
obvious modification applicable also to curves with rectangular
co-ordinates.     It takes into account all " errors " except over
shooting, and this, in the case of the capillary electrometer, can be
got rid of by inserting a sufficient external resistance. A point of great
practical importance is that no special care is needed in photograph
                "                           "
ing the three Normal Excursions                required for the purpose.
    The principle of the method, so far as it relates to the calibration
 of the sub-normal, which is the only difficult part, is as follows : —
   Assuming that the resistance in circuit is such as to render the
electrometer perfectly dead-beat, wo may extend the law of the
time-relations of the movement to include all forms of capillary,

 thus :—
    The ratio of the velocity of the meniscus to the difference between
 the E.M.F. of the source, and that of the charge contained in the
 electrometer, is constant for any given part of the capillary, but may

   vary for different points along its length. It is reqaired to determine
   the amount of this variation.
      Two normal excursions are photographed.         In one, the zero is
  below the field of view, and the movement is directed upwards.          In
   the other, the zero is raised above the field of view, by a suitable
  alteration of the pressure bulbs, and the connections with the
  potentiometer are reversed, so that the movement of the meniscus is
  downwards.       The exact limits and relative position of the two
  excursions are immaterial so long as the capillary itself has not been
  shifted.   The object is to obtain two curves in opposite directions,
  running right across the plate.
     Let p be a point on the capillary, the position of which is deter
  mined by its distance from the reference-circle, or upper limit of the
  photograph, in each case.
     Using Vp to represent the acting P.D., indicated by the velocity
  of the meniscus at the point p, we may write
                   — Vp = —x for the upward excursion,
  and similarly
                   +VP = +x for the downward excursion.
     Let — a = the P.D. necessary to bring the meniscus from ji to a
 point q, above p. Then by the known law of the capillary electro
 meter + a is the P.D. necessary to bring the meniscus from q to p.
 And the acting P.D. at q is
                   — Vj = — x+a for the upward excursion,
 and
                   +V't = +x' + a for the downward excursion.
 Subtracting,    we have
                  V,+V, =    x + x' = Vp+V'p.
 That is to say, in any pair of oppositely directed excursions which
 overlap, the algebraic difference between the acting P.D. of the
upward movement and the acting P.D. of the downward movement
at the same level is constant for all points common to both curves.
    But the velocity of the meniscus at any point is measured by the
polar subnormal to the curve, whence it follows that " The algebraic
difference between the polar subnormals to corresponding points upon two
oppositely directed excursions is constant if the time-relations    of the
instrument agree with the formula r = ae-0*-"       That is to say, repre
senting the subnormals to the two excursions by the letters N and
N' respectively,

 1895.]      On the Calibration  of the  Capillary Electrometer.        21
    With a capillary of different form, this relation will       no longer
hold.     The velocity of the meniscus may be different, for the same
acting P.D., at the points p and q. But the value of the subnormal at
q is at once given by the formula
                           Nj + M',        *
    The constant k is most conveniently determined by measuring the
subnormal at the point pona third photograph in which a normal
excursion of known value starts from a zero point within the field of
view.
                        Practice of the Method.
    It  may be convenient to describe briefly the entire process of
calibrating an electrometer. In order to ensure that the tube shall
always occupy the same position, the image of the tip of the capil
lary is adjusted to a mark on the back of the exposing shutter. It
is of course not perfectly in focus, but is sufficiently sharp for the
 purpose.     This mark serves for all experiments with the same
capillary.
                     Calibration of  the Scale Readings.
   A   millimetre scale on glass is fixed to the focussing screen so that
its zero coincides with the upper limit of the slit. The slit and the
cylindrical lens are then removed, and the image of the meniscus
adjusted to zero on the scale.
   The E.M.F.'s necessary to bring the mercury down to 5, 10, 15, &c.,
mm. on the glass scale are then measured with a potentiometer, care
being taken to short-circuit between each observation lest the zero
should alter.     With very delicate instruments, or if the pressure
tubes are not air-tight, it is sometimes easier to measure the length
of the excursion produced by a small constant P.D. in various parts
of the tube, and obtain the value of the scale-readings by calcu
lation.
                       Calibration of  the Subnormal.
   Two normal excursions in opposite directions are photographed.
Each must bo large enough to traverse the full length of the slit
during the passage of the plate, but not much more, otherwise the
curves will be too steep for accurate measurement.
   A non-inductive, non-polarisable resistance of at least 10,000 ohms
must be included in the circuit. The subnormals to these curves
are then measured at points 5, 10, 15, &c., mins. from the reference
circle.
   As an illustration I give the results obtained with an electrometer
 which had been in use for a long time. The tube had been cali

      The fourth column shows the initial velocity of the excursion
  caused by the same difference of potential, for seven equidistant
  positions of the meniscus. But the exact value of this difference of
  potential is unknown, because the zero-positions of the excursions
  are not recorded. A third photograph is therefore taken in order to
  determine the value in volts of a centimetre of the subnormal at some
  one of the positions in the table.                 To do this, the potentiometer is
  set accurately to give some known P.D.                         The zero point of the
  meniscus is brought about 30 mm. below the reference circle, and the
  excursion is directed upwards.                   The subnormal to the resulting
  curve is measured at a point 25 mm. from the reference-circle, i.e., in
 the middle of the available space. It would be difficult to make the
 excursion start exactly from the 25 mm. mark, and besides it is
 easier to place the tangent-line accurately against the curve at a
 point some distance from its origin.* The value of the acting P.D. at
 the point measured is found by subtracting the P.D. corresponding
 to the distance through which the meniscus has risen, from the P.D.
 indicated by the potentiometer.
     In the case quoted, the acting P.D., at a point 25 mm. from the
 reference circle, was 0'02 volt, and the subnormal to the curve at
 this point was 15 cm.

   The numbers in the fifth colnmn are obtained from those in the
fourth column by dividing each of them by 55. The last column
needs no explanation.         The time spent in taking these photographs,
and another set nearer the tip of the tube, was about one hour, and
the calibration of the scale readings and measurement of the sub
normals of both sets, was effected in an hour and a half. The entire
calibration covered 95 mm. of the projected image of the capillary,
 but the upper part was completely spoilt by the stickiness of the
tube. One advantage of this process is that it enables such defects
to be detected by inspection.          Each mechanical obstruction leaves a
mark on both curves, but most evidently on that which has the
smaller subnormal.          The effect is equivalent to a loss of time in the
excursion.      The meniscus is retarded in the act of passing the point,
but immediately afterwards resumes its normal velocity. It would
be quite possible, if it were worth while, to measure the "work
done
       " in
             passing a sticky place.
   It should be observed that if the value of the scale-readings is
known, the calibration of the subnormal can be effected by means of
a single excursion of known P.D., provided that the zero-point is
visible on the photograph.          For the acting P.D. at any point on the
curve can be found by subtracting from the E.M.F. given by the
potentiometer, the P.D. corresponding to the rise of the meniscus ;
and the ratio        —K — 1—: for a series of equidistant points, gives the
                   subnormal
calibration-curve of the capillary.           This was the method      I employed
in 1891,    but it  requires   much   greater   care   to   get concordant results,
and   I  realised that until some simpler process could be found, few
people would care to use this method of determining the value of
rapid changes of potential difference with the capillary electro
meter.
   Note. — Professor Einthoven, in a paper published in 1894,* recom
mends that in selecting an instrument, care should be taken that it
is of equal sensitiveness throughout the working portion of the tube,
aud assumes that such a test is a sufficient criterion of its fitness for
use.
   This    I have not found       to be the case. A constant subnormal
is always associated with a slight increase of sensitiveness towards the
tip of the capillary.
   More recentlyf he has put forward a statement having a very
important bearing on this problem.               He now finds that in some
electrometers    the  ratio  of the  velocity   of  the meniscus to the acting
P.D. is not constant, but diminishes as the mercury approaches its
position of rest. In such cases he proposes to construct a curve of

constants representing the variations of this ratio for different values
of the acting P.D.         It is hardly necessary to point out that this is
                                           "
quite a different thing from my calibration curve," which relates
to the variation of the time-relations at different parts of the same
capillary.
    With regard to Professor Einthoven's observations,                I can only say
that    I have not met with the phenomenon save in               "          " electro
                                                                    sticky
meters ; and in such cases minute irregularities are plainly visible on
the curves, when the plates are driven fast enough.                  But the rate I
employ     for physical investigations, namely,          from  1,000 to 1,500 mm.
per second, is so many times greater than that used in the examples
he gives, viz., 20 to 25 mm., that I am able to detect what would
otherwise be invisible.         His instruments would appear to be much
less rapid and less sensitive than most of mine, but he uses a higher
magnifying power for the projection.               The actual distance traversed
by the meniscus itself in making the excursion, of which the
analysis was given in my paper,* was fifteen times as great a3 that
traversed by the meniscus of his electrometers in the eight excur
sions adduced in support of his new theory. But although those
excursions are smaller and slower, the curves are much steeper than
 I should deem advisable, especially as the length measured, according
to his plan, is the reciprocal of the ratio to be determined.
    That there must have been either irregularities in the curves, or
considerable error in the measurements, is manifest when, instead of
taking the average values as he has done, the eight curves are reduced
to a common scale, and plotted on the same sheet of paper.                     One of
 them especially, No. 205 A, differs from all the rest in form.
    By using the asymptote to the normal curve as a line of reference,
 Professor Einthoven introduces a source of error. The slightest sticki
 ness may cause the meniscus to stop short of the asymptote, or an
insignificant amount of overshooting may carry it beyond, and a
 difference which would appear in the fifth place of decimals in esti
 mating an E.M.F. becomes of crucial importance in calculating the
 time-relations of the movement.           It is for this reason that I use the
 upper limit of the photograph as a reference circle, and reckon the
 displacement of the meniscus from its zero-position.
    I  have, since reading Professor Einthoven's paper, again calibrated,
 by  both   the methods described in this communication, the electro
 meter in use in the Physiological Laboratory at Oxford.                    Both cali
 brations agree, proving that the          instrument       shows    no  trace of the
 peculiarity mentioned by him.              Should I detect it in any future
                   I
 electrometers, will not fail to communicate the fact to the Society.

1895.]           Investigation of the  Laws of Attrition.             25
VI.   " An Experimental Investigation of the Laws of Attrition."
       By F. T. Trouton. D.Sc. Communicated by J. Joly,
       F.R.S. Received July 5, 1895.
   The method of investigation employed in these experiments con
sists essentially in rnbbing two solid surfaces together under specified
conditions, and in finding the amount of material removed off the
surfaces in this way. The apparatus consisted in an arrangement by
means of which two parallel cylinders of the substances to be experi
mented with could be rotated, while at the same time pressed together
with a known force. The amount removed was found by weighing
the cylinders before and after.
   The substances experimented with up to the present are all of a
non-metallic character. The results of the experiments may shortly
be summed up as follows : —
   1. The amount removed by attrition          under otherwise similar
circumstances is proportional to the pressure.
   2. In each case there is a critical pressure below which two
surfaces when rubbed together tend to polish, and to gradually cease
losing material.
   3. The amount removed by attrition from a given substance when
rubbed by other kinds of substances harder than itself, depends (to
a first approximation) only on the properties of the substance itself,
and does not increase with the hardness of the other body.
   The first of these three permits of an absolute coefficient of
attrition, or shortly the attritivity, being defined as the amount
removed per unit area, during unit displacement, when two surfaces
of the same material undergo relative movement while pressed
together with unit pressure.
                             The Attritometer.
   The simplest form an apparatus for making experiments on
 attrition could take would, apparently, be that of two plane surfaces,
 which could be made to rub each other while pressed together, but
the difficulty of removing the attrited material makes some modifica
tion necessary.     The form of apparatus finally adopted consisted
essentially of two parallel cylinders, which could be rotated so as to
rub each other while pressed together by a known force. Oppor
tunity is thus afforded during rotation of dusting off any of the
adhering material.      This was effected by pads or wisps of cotton
wool, held against the cylinders by means of small stiff brushes on
which the wool remains caught.            Fig. 1 shows the apparatus
 diagrammatically in plan.

                                     Plan.
    The cylinders A and B, which are mounted on steel spindles with
coned ends, stand vertically.       One of the spindles, B, the Ibwer in
the figure, is mounted on stationary bearings.        The bearings of the
other, A, are carried by a framework which swings after the manner
of a gate on an axis. This axis is placed so that the cylinders may
come together in a line tangentially to the circle of swing of the
framework.       This cylinder will, for shortness, be referred to as the
movable cylinder, the other as the fixed.
    The force pressing the cylinders together is applied by a cord
fastened to the end of the swinging frame, and passing over a pulley
 to an attached weight, W. The rotation of the cylinders was main
tained by chains, and toothed wheels from a driving shaft carrying a
pulley, C, which took a leather belt. It will be seen from the
diagram that the driving shaft in the apparatus nsed worked inside
the tube, which served as the pivot or axis for the swinging frame.
It is necessary, in transmitting rotation to the movable cylinder,
that care be taken that no force be introduced pressing the cylinders
together.     This is effected in the apparatus used by placing rollers,
D E, carried by an independent frame near the driving shaft, in such
a position as to direct the line of chains through the axis of suspen
sion of the swinging frame. The rollers are made adjustable, so as
to suit different sized cylinders.     The driving power was supplied by
an electric motor geared down twice.         The number of rotations was
ascertained by a counter attached to the driving shaft.
   The mounting of a cylinder, of the substance being dealt with, on
its spindle is shown in Fig. 2. The diagram explains itself. The toothed
wheel is made to pass on and off the spindle, and is held in place by
a removable steel pin.       In order to weigh the cylinder, the toothed
wheel is removed. This is necessary, on account of oil from the
chain.

paper, that the weight attrited may be considered proportional to the
force bringing the cylinders together.
    We can thus say that the weight attrited from any given area is
 proportional to the pressure, although we may not know the value of
the pressure itself.        For we can express the weight removed thus,
W = K.V.T.JPdA,         since the integral is equal to the force      in question.
 We assume here that the effect is simply proportional to the dis
placement VT, thus neglecting all terms involving higher powers of
the velocity.*
    I  have called the value of the constant K, when the two surfaces
are of the same material, the coefficient of attrition or the attritivity
of the substance. In this way arbitrariness in definition is avoided,
such as would be introduced, say, in assuming all bodies to be
attrited with one standard substance — by diamond, for instance —
and we arrive at a so-called absolute unit. The dimension of attri
tivity will be seen to be the inverse square of a velocity [K] =
 [T3   x IT*].
    It might be thought that the coefficient here introduced did
not refer to anything which could properly bo looked upon or
advisedly classed as one of the properties of a substance, but its
importance may perhaps be better seen further down, where it is
shown that with bodies harder than itself the amount attrited from
a given substance can practically be considered as depending only on
its own value of the coefficient.
   Elsewhere (' Brit. Assoc. Report,' Leeds, 1890) this coefficient            has
   *  In none of the experiments made was any difference observed due to running
the apparatus at different rates ; but no great difference in the rates of rotation
could be tried owing to the apparatus not working smoothly at higher speeds.

as objectionable, from a physical point of view.            This will be under

for any substance, supposing no other kind of matter to exist.

   In Table are given the coefficients of attrition in the case of seven
substances. These numbers, when multiplied by 10-12, are in terms
of C.G.S. units, that is to say, they are the weights of material in
grams, attrited per square centimeter, during a centimeter displace
ment under a pressure of one dyne per square centimeter. To bring
these to English measure (any mass, feet and seconds), we need not
trouble about the mass, but have only to multiply twice by 3048, the
number of centimeters in a foot, since the dimensions of attrition, it
will be remembered, are the same as that of the inverse square of a
velocity.

   The quartz cylinders used were cut with the axis parallel to the
principal axis of the crystal ; the material looked transparent and
clear. The English plate glass had the usual greenish appearance.
The French plate was white and clear. The serpentine was the
variety known as Galway marble — olive-green with whitish streaks.
The marble cylinders were made of white statuary marble, and
contained disseminated throughout its mass small and transparent
microscopic crystals of a felspar, probably albite.               The alabaster
 was whitish, with a slight flesh-coloured tinge ; it was rather inclined
 to wear into somewhat roundish lumps, due, no doubt, to want of
 uniformity.     The cylinders of plaster of Paris were east in moulds,
 and, after having thoroughly set, were turned up in a lathe.
    The cylinders were all about 5 cm. in diameter, and varied in
 length from 0-5 cm. to 4 cm., according to the amount of material
 available.
    Particular care has to be taken to thoroughly remove the attrided
 material.    If a fine dust is allowed to remain attached to the cylin

 ders,  it acts  as a lubricant, and diminishes the amount attrited.*         As
 explained further on, the pressure must exceed a certain minimum
 value in each case, or polishing will ensue.
    In all cases it is the ultimate constant values which are to be taken
 as the weight of material attrited ; that is to say, the cylinders should
 be allowed to rub themselves to the proper surface so as to continue
 giving a constant value before taking a determination. It is found
 that there is a surface proper to each pressure.             When the pressure
 is increased the amount at first removed is less than subsequently ;
 on changing from a higher to a lower pressure the reverse is generally
 true.t
    With the harder         substances used, chipping at the edges of the
 cylinders    was     sometimes a source of considerable trouble.           It is
 advantageous to have the edges chamfered off, as this gives a better
 resistance to crushing.          This tendency to chip puts a limit to the
 pressure   which     can be  used.
     The results given in this paper cannot be considered as the best
 which can be obtained with the form of apparatus used, for, from
 the first, the end aimed at was rather to gain a general insight into
the phenomenon in question by accumulating a large number of
results than to determine accurately the value of the coefficient in
individual cases.
                         The Critical Pressure of Attrition.
    In  the case of each kind of material the pressure must be above a
 certain value in order that a constant value be finally reached in the
weight of material attrited. This particular pressure I have called
the critical pressure for attrition.           If the pressure be below this the
amount attrited gets less and less as time goes on, and ultimately
the surface becomes polished on the rubbing being continued long
enough. Before this was understood the results obtained at different
pressures were often inconsistent, and a great deal of time was thereby
lost. For consistent results it is, of course, necessary to operate above
the critical pressure.
    Up to the present I have made no determination of the actual value
of the critical pressure for any substance ; but the following table,
derived from data incidentally obtained in determining attritivity,
gives the approximate relative values in the case of the same substance
experimented with. The critical pressure necessary to ensure that
quartz attrite quartz is assumed to be 1000 : —
   * In the case of the softer substances experimented with it was found advan
tageous to hare two extra pads or wisps of cotton wool which could be applied by
hand so as to remove the very fine dust.
   t  Many of the irregularities in the results given arose probably from not
attending sufficiently to this precaution.

   These experiments brought to b'ght the unsuspected fact that the
quantity rubbed off a given substance does not increase with the
hardness of the substance with which          rubbed, once the latter it      is                                          is
equal to that of itself.  In fact, would    look   from the table to be
                                                        it
rather the other way. This, however,       probably due to secondary    is
causes.  So that we may state, as     first approximation, that when
                                                         a

   On the other band, from the general trend of the fignres in the
table it would seem that, when rubbed by a softer substance, a certain
amount is always to be considered lost. (In the table when 0 appears
it means that the amount, if any, is less than experimental errors
introduced.) No attempt has been made to deduce a relation con
necting the several quantities here involved, as, unfortunately, the
figures themselves cannot be relied on sufficiently to warrant
doing so.
                           Tables of Experiments.
   In the following tables the force is given in what are practically
arbitrary units.     The numbers themselves are the number of lbs.
bung   over the pulley in each experiment. To obtain the force pressing
the cylinders together, these must be, in the first place, increased in
the ratio of the leverage of the swinging frame.
   For the purposes of comparison the weights obtained, which are
given in the two parallel columns, have been divided by the number
of rotations made by the cylinders in each case and by the number
of units of weight acting over the pulley.                In the tables, decimal
places   have  been  omitted  :  these    are given   beneath    each table in the
deduced mean.       To bring the result to C.G.S. units it is necessary
 to divide by the sum of the mean circumferences of the cylinders,
 by the number of grams in a lb., by g, and to multiply by 77/69'75
 the ratio of the leverage.      From the pivot or axis of the swinging
 frame to where the cord leading to the weight was attached was
 77 cm., from the same point to the cylinder was 69-75.

 VII. "Experiments       on   Fluid Viscosity."        By A. Mallock.
       Communicated by       Lord Kelvin, P.R.S.          Received    July
       26, 1895.
                                (Abstract.)
   The paper gives an account of a series of experiments on the vis
 cosity of water made with revolving cylinders.        The cylinders were
 coaxial, and the fluid was placed in the annulus between them.
 Special precautions were taken to eliminate the effect of the terminal
 conditions at the lower end of the annulns, with the result that the
 motion of the fluid in the annulus was practically the same as it
 would have been in an annulus of infinite length.
   One of the cylinders was driven at known and constant speeds,
and the moment transmitted to the other cylinder, which was sus
pended by a torsion wire, was measured for each speed.          In some of
the experiments the inner cylinder was suspended on the torsion
 wire, and the outer one revolved, nnd in others these conditions
 were reversed. Two sets of cylinders were used, giving annuli
 of one inch and half an inch width respectively.        When the outer
cylinder was the revolving one,     it was  found  that,  np to a certain
speed, the transmitted moment increased as the first power of the
 speed.   Above this speed there was a region where that moment was
indeterminate between certain limits, and varied suddenly from one
 value to another at uncertain intervals.     At higher speeds again the
moment was perfectly       determinate,  but  varied as a power of the
speed higher than the square.
   When the inner cylinder was the revolving one, none of these vari
ations in the character of the function representing moment in terms
of speed were observed.       At not even the lowest speeds . was the
moment proportional to the first power of the velocity, but the whole
series agreed fairly with the equation, moment = constant x velo
city to the power of 1/8.
   Returning to the experiments where the outer cylinder revolved,
the coefficient of viscosity of water deduced from these experiments
at speeds where the moment was proportional to the first power of
the speed, was greater than Poiseuille's value, and the difference was
greater with the one inch than with the half inch annulus.        In some
former experiments of the same kind where an annulus of about
0'2 in. was used, the value of the coefficient of viscosity obtained
was very nearly the same as Poiseuille's.
   Taken together, these experiments tend to show that there must be
more than two forms of flow possible for a viscous fluid subjected to
shearing force, and that long before anything like permanent eddying

is set up, the motion may depart from the purely lamellar one, which
appears to hold in capillary tubes, although in the motion in question
the resistance is  still on the whole proportional        to the first power of
the speed.

       The Expansion of Argon and of Helium as compared with
       that of Air and Hydrogen."                  By J. P. KuENEN, Ph.D.,

       Ramsay, F.R.S. Received November 14, 1895.
   Accurate comparisons of temperatures, as read with the aid of
thermometers filled with different gases, have not often been made.
The history of the subject may be said to have begun with the
classical researches of Regnault.*          Of recent work of this kind, that

   1895.]             The Expansion of Argon and of Helium.                              61
  of Chappuis* was performed entirely at temperatures below                     100°, the
  gases employed being hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide.                         The
 experiments        of Grunmach        and    Pernetf    were   also conducted at tem
  peratures     below 100°.          CraftsJ has compared the readings of a
  •number of mercury thermometers with those obtained by Regnault
  and by himself with a hydrogen thermometer. Wiebe and B6ttcher§
  have determined the boiling points of a number of liquids in terms of
  the expansion of air.
      In connexion with the work on argon and helium in progress at
  University College, it was suggested by Professor Ramsay that a
 comparison should be made between the readings shown by thermo
  meters containing respectively argon, helium, hydrogen, and air.
  The temperatures used were : the melting point of ice and the boiling
  points of water, chlorbenzene, aniline, quinoline, and bromnaph-
 ihalene respectively. The gas to be experimented upon was contained
  in a bulb about 12 cm. long and 2'2 cm. wide, sealed at one end to a
  fine capillary tube about 12 cm. long ; this, in turn, was connected
  with a piece of thick-walled glass tubing, having an inside diameter
 -of about 0-2 cm.         The wider tube was fitted with a stopcock, for con
  venience in filling the bulb, and at its lower end was connected with
  a stout rubber tube, which led to a movable mercury reservoir. Near
 the point at which the fine capillary tube was sealed to the wider tube,
 * mark was made on the latter : the mercury was always brought up
 to this mark in the experiments, and the difference of level in the
  tube and in the mercury reservoir was read off, with the aid of a
 telescope, from a glass scale graduated in millimetres, which stood
 directly behind the apparatus.
      The bulb of the gas thermometer was heated in one of Ramsay and
 Young's vapour jackets, the mark on the stem being just below the
•cork closing the bottom of the jacket : consequently a small portion
 of the stem was not heated to the temperature of the vapour in the
 jacket. The error thus introduced was taken into account. No part
of the mercury column which compressed the gas in the bulb was
 heated more than a few degrees above tho temperature of the room,
 screens being employed to cut off radiation : the temperature of the
 mercury was, however, always determined as accurately as circum
 stances would permit, and the readings reduced to 0°.                    In order to
 protect the thermometer bulb from the effects of radiation, the jacket
 was shielded by an outer cylinder of thick pasteboard, with an air
•space between.

    Since the mercury was always brought to the same point on the
 stem  of the thermometer bulb, the volume of the gas, except for the
change produced by the expansion of the glass, was in all the experi
 ments the same, while the pressure was, of course, different for each
 temperature employed. For convenience, the bulb was filled, in the
 case of each gas, at from two-thirds to three-fourths atmospheric
 pressure : under these circumstances, the bulb was never subjected to
 an internal pressure greater than about 1| atmos.
    Corrections. — All pressures were reduced to 0°.     The coefficient of
 expansion of the glass of the bulb was carefully determined, and was
found to be 000002804 ; its effect was allowed for. The effect of
 capillarity in depressing the mercury in the narrow tube was deter
 mined and taken into account. The volume of that part of the stem
 of the bulb which was not in the ice or vapour, as the case might be,
 was found to be 0'0003 of the whole, and was allowed for in the cal
 culations.    The change of volume in the bulb due to change of
 pressure was found to be negligable.
    Gases. — The first gas experimented with was hydrogen.        This was
prepared    from  pure   zinc, was washed  with  potassium permanganate
solution and then with strong sulphuric acid, and was dried with
phosphoric anhydride before it entered the previously exhausted
bulb. The thermometer was successively filled and exhausted several
times, in order to remove impurities, and was heated while vacuous
to dislodge any gas clinging to the surface of the glass.      Finally, the
purified hydrogen was allowed to enter slowly until the required
pressure was obtained.
    Two sets of experiments were made with air. In the first set no
effort was made to remove carbon dioxide, although the air was of
course carefully dried. The readings were made by one of us alone, and,
on account of the numerous details to be attended to which actually
require the attention of two observers to be put beyond question, are
probably not as accurate as the other series.     The second series had
to be brought to a close after the pressures corresponding to 0° and
the boiling points of water and quinoline had been determined.           In
this series care was taken to use air free from carbon dioxide.
   The helium used was some of that prepared and purified by Pro
fessor Ramsay. Its density was 213, that of oxygen being taken
as 16.
   The argon employed was prepared from atmospheric air by the
method of Professor Ramsay.         A large gas-holder was filled with air
which had been slowly drawn through a long combustion tube filled
with red-hot copper.       This gas was dried, passed again over the hot
copper, and then over red-hot magnesium shavings until absorption
of nitrogen ceased.     By these processes a gas was obtained consisting
of about equal volumes of argon and nitrogen.         Passage of this gas

backwards        and forwards through tubes containing respectively red
hot magnesium, red-hot copper oxide (to remove the hydrogen given
off by the magnesium on heating), soda lime, and phosphoric anhy
dride, failed to remove the nitrogen completely.                          Finally, with the
aid of a circulating apparatus,* which ensured the passage of all the
gas over the hot magnesium, a product was obtained whose density
was found to be 19-99, oxygen being 16. The thermometer was filled
with this gas.
    After the pressures exerted by the argon when the bulb was sur
rounded by melting ice aud by the vapours of water, chlorbenzene,
and aniline, successively, had been determined, the thermometer was
heated in the vapour of quinoline, when, for some unknown reason, it
cracked.       A new bulb, of the same glass and as nearly as possible of
the same size, was prepared, cleaned, and filled with argon, and a
second series of readings made.
    Finally, the argon was replaced by air, and the second series of
readings for air, referred to above, begun. On account of the closing
of the laboratory for the summer, this series was not carried as far as
would have been desirable.
    Temperatures. — The temperature of the jacket, when filled with
steam from water boiling smoothly under atmospheric pressnre, was
taken from Kohlrausch's " Physical Measurements."                                 The samples
 of the boiling liquids used were re-distilled, and were found to pass
 over without a rise in temperature of more than a tenth of a degree,
in three cases ; of a fifth of a degree in the fourth case.

«4              Drs.    J. P. Kuenen and W. W. Randall.                  [Nov. 28,
    The results of our observations are laid down in the table.                 In
 three cases (3, 4, and 6) the reading was taken at 0°, as well              as at
 the boiling-point of water; this enabled us to calculate the coefficient
 of expansion between these two points. The result is shown in the
 fourth column. The higher temperatures determined with these
 thermometers have been derived from the observed pressures by
 using the coefficients thus measured. As the barometric pressures
 differed, more or less, from the normal value, the boiling-points had
 to be reduced to normal pressure, for which operation we made use of
 the differences in Ramsay and Young's well-known tables.* In
 calculating the temperatures of air thermometer I, where the reading
 at 0° had been omitted, and of argon thermometer II, where we did
 not take the reading in steam, we used the coefficients found with air
 thermometer      II  and argon thermometer I, respectively, in the first
.case basing our calculations on the reading in steam.                   With the
 hydrogen thermometer, where the reading at 0° had not been taken,
 we accepted O003663 as the coefficient of that gas, and based our
"calculations of the temperatures again on the reading in steam.
    Since the readings of the mercury surfaces, with the gas thermo
 meter as well as the barometer, were taken on a millimeter scale, an
 occasional mistake in the final pressure of 0-l or 0'2 mm. is by no
 means excluded.         Uncertainties of that amount do not, however,
 account for the differences between the results obtained with the
.different thermometers. The readings of air thermometer I are,
 perhaps, somewhat less to be relied upon than the others, because
 they had to be observed, as was stated above, by one of us in the
Absence of the other.           The boiling-point of bromnaphthalene, as
determined with the helium thermometer, is also very uncertain,
  because the position of the mercury was not at all stable, probably
.on account of the difficulty of obtaining rapid and smooth boiling of
  the liquid. Yet, even if these values are not taken into account, the
 differences are very remarkable, especially with quinoline, and the
  agreement with Wiebe's result is also not quite satisfactory.            Part of
 these differences may     be  due   to impurity     in the liquids used in the
 jacket.    Pains were taken at the beginning of our experiments to
 have them quite pure, but as the values show, apparently, a tendency
 to rise, it may be that continuous boiling produced slight decomposi
 tion. In the case of bromnaphthalene this is more than possible. If
  more time had been at our disposal, we should have tested the purity
 of our substances during the operations. As it is now, it would be
  unwise to draw conclusions from our figures about the exact beha
  viour of any of the gases used at high temperatures. The coefficients
-of expansion between 0° and 100° found for argon and helium agree
  very well with the values usually found for gases, and there is no

indication   of anything extraordinary happening to these gases at
high temperatures.      When argon thermometer I was heated in the
vapour of quinoline a remarkable expansion of the gas was observed,
continuing for two hours until a maximum value was reached ; this
gave an apparent temperature of 243-5° for the boiling point of
quinoline.    On cooling the thermometer, however, it was found to be
cracked, and some drops of quinoline were noticed inside the bulb.
The measurements made in this case were therefore rejected, and a
new series was begun with argon thermometer II, which gave a value
about normal.      How the quinoline could have found its way into the
bulb while an interior pressure of about 970 mm. existed within it,
withont the argon escaping rapidly at the same time, is not quite
clear. It may be the vapour passed through the crack when the
temperature was rather low, and that the opening was closed by the
later expansion of the glass.
   For completeness' sake, we give in the table the boiling-points of
the same substances determined with a mercury thermometer, as
calculated from Ramsay and Young's tables. But the irregularities
of the thermometers prevent our giving any definite numbers for the
reduction of those tables to accord with any of the gas thermometer
scales.   A direct comparison, such as was executed by Wiebe and
Bottcher with a mercury thermometer of known constitution, like
the Jena glass thermometer, would have been desirable. Differences
of boiling-point resulting from impurities would have affected both
thermometers in the same way, and would have enabled us to ascer
tain how much of the differences found resulted from that source of
error. But here also want of time prevented our extending our pro
gramme beyond the limits fixed beforehand.
   Notwithstanding the incompleteness and want of perfection of our
work, we do not hesitate to publish our results : the difficulties to be
overcome in experiments of this kind are serious, and we did not
make it our object to obtain results of remarkable accuracy. The
real motive of the work was to discover whether argon and helium
show extraordinary behaviour at high temperatures, or not — and our
results apparently establish the fact that they do not. Their beha
viour, so far as expansion is concerned and within the limits of
temperature which we used, is apparently the same as that of so-
called perfect gases or mixtures of them.
   Finally, it is a great pleasure to record our hearty appreciation of
the kindly assistance of Professor Ramsay, at whoso suggestion, and
under whose supervision, these experiments have been conducted.

   Although blood invariably contains a small amount of dissolved
nitrogen, it appears that with animals no absorption of that gas
takes place save what is due to its solubility in the serum of the
blood. Nor is nitrogen eliminated from the system in the ele
mentary state.
   At Professor Ramsay's suggestion, experiments have been made on
the comparative amount of argon in ordinary air, and in air which
had been frequently breathed, with the view of ascertaining whether,
if the proportion of oxygen and carbon dioxide in air be very much
altered, argon would either enter into, or be expelled from, the
respiratory system.      The result of the experiments to be described
is to show that the proportion of argon to nitrogen remains nearly
normal, even when the air has been greatly altered in composition by
respiration.
    1. Percentage                                —
                   of Argon in Atmospheric Air. A mercury reservoir,
the capacity of which was accurately determined by weighing with
water, held 555'2 c.c.     The upper end was fitted with a three-way
tap, sealed on to the glass.       Through this tap was admitted air,
purified by passage      over soda-lime   and phosphoric anhydride, to
remove water-vapour and carbonic anhydride.           This reservoir was
jacketed   with   water of  known   temperature, so   that the volume of
the air could be measured with great exactness.         The other branch
of the three-way tap led to a tube filled with copper, in order to
absorb oxygen ; one containing copper oxide to destroy any organic
matter which might have been present, and one filled with magne
 sium turnings to absorb nitrogen ; these tubes were kept red-hot.
 Other tubes were filled with soda-lime and phosphoric anhydride, so
 as to remove water and carbon dioxide, which might have been pro
 duced.    The air was circulated over these absorbents until little but
 argon was left. The gas-holder was filled three times at 18'8° C,
 and 752'1 mm. pressure.       After absorption had nearly ceased, the
 remaining gas was pumped out of the tubes, mixed with oxygen, and
 sparked for many hours in presence of caustic soda, to remove the
 last traces of nitrogen.     The residue, after absorption of oxygen
 with potassium pyrogallate, measured       15'91  c.c. at 21-4° C,  and
 754'5 mm. pressure.
    Reducing both volumes to standard temperature and pressure, it
appears that

                 100-0 c.c. of air contain 0-937 c.c. of argon.
    Calculating the percentage in atmospheric nitrogen, we have : —
 100 c.c.   of mixed atmospheric nitrogen and argon contain 1-186 c.c.
    Owing to the avoidance of the presence                   of water   during these
experiments, they are prohably more accurate than the original
experiments of Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay.                      They found*
1-04 and 1'03 in two experiments in which the nitrogen was re
moved by sparking with oxygen in presence of dilute caustic soda ;
and    I'll -when the nitrogen was removed by means of magnesium.
    Owing to the vacation, it has not been possible to put this result
on record before now.              And M. Th. Schloesing, fils, has recently
published-}- the results of a series of estimations in which the per
centage of argon in atmospheric nitrogen was fonnd to be 1-180 to
1*185, or as a mean 1-183 per cent., a number almost identical with
that just recorded.          M. Schloesing has re-calculated the ratio which
ought to subsist between the densities of atmospheric and " chemi
      "
cal     nitrogen on the basis of his determinations; but in doing so,
he has made use of the value 1-2505 gram as the weight of 1 litre of
the latter, instead of 1-25114            Moreover, he has assumed Regnault's
value, now superseded, for the weight of 1 litre of hydrogen, viz.,
0-0896 gram, instead of that given by the more recent determinations,
0'0899. §      These are not serious errors, but it is more satisfactory to
 calculate the correct number.            The question is : — If the weight of a
 litre of pure nitrogen is 1-2511 gram, and of argon 1-7818 gram, and
 if atmospheric nitrogen contain 1-185 per cent, of argon, what
 should be the weight of a litre of the latter ?               The answer is 1-2574.
 Lord Rayleigh found the number 1-2572, one almost exactly
 identical.
     For material for the second part of this research,            I have to express
 my thanks to Dr. Marcet, F.R.S., and his assistant, Mr. Floris.                 The

    The air was breathed over and over again by Mr. Floris,                  until
after 10 minutes' respiration its composition had become : —
              Nitrogen and argon                   80'96 per cent.

   An estimation of the argon was carried out in precisely the same
manner as before, on 1297-8 c.c. of breathed air, measured at 17"2° C.
and 759 mm. pressure. But the air was breathed over water, the
requisite change of volume on respiration having been secured by
breathing into one of Dr. Marcet's counterpoised gas-holders.                 The
argon found measured at 17'7°        C.   and  752'3   mm.  pressure,   12-85  c.c.
These numbers corrected give :—
          1196 c.c. of breathed   air yielded 11-72 c.c. of argon.
            100 c.c.      „             „        0'980 c.c. of argon.
   Calculating the percentage on the nitrogen, we have            : —
    100 c.c. of nitrogen and argon of breathed air contains 1*210 c.c.
   This percentage is larger than that in normal air.           One of two sup
positions may    be  made  : either the   increased   amount   is   due to the air
having been confined over water during breathing, or argon is given
off from blood in greater amount than it is absorbed, when the compo
sition of the air in the lungs is so much altered ; the former appears
the more probable supposition.           In any case the difference is not
great ;  and  it would  appear    that   argon, like free nitrogen, plays no
important part in the animal economy, save as a diluent.

Mr. C. Lothian Bell, of Middlesbrough,              from "Allhusen's Well,"
was sent on to us to be tested for argon.              The usual constituents,
nitrogen, hydrocarbons, &c., were removed by the usual absorbents,
magnesium, copper oxide, &c., and finally by sparking with oxygen
over caustic soda. The only noticeable feature was the great difficulty
in removing the hydrocarbon, which for long resisted the action of
red-hot copper oxide. The circulation had to be continued for two
days before absorption was nearly complete.               In one case (Kellas)
555 c.c. of gas gave 2 c.c. of residue, and in another (Ramsay)

 indifferent     gas.   The first portion was unfortunately lost, but the
 spectrum      of the  second   portion was carefully compared with that of
 argon, and the lines were all found to be coincident. No new lines
 appeared, nor was any helium yellow visible.
     An incombustible gas from another well at the same place was also
 tested, and was found to contain 0'5 per cent, of argon (Kellas).
     Some gas from a boiling spring near Reykjavik, Iceland, was col
 lected last autumn (Ramsay), and, on removing the combinable
 constituents, 7"45 c.c. were obtained from 660 c.c. of the gas. This
 is a greater proportion of argon than is present in air, being 1-14 per
cent. No helium could be detected in the gas, nor were there any
 lines which could not be recognised as belonging to argon.
     It has been thought worth while to place on record these experi
 ments, although they show nothing remarkable. We have to express
 our indebtedness to Mr. Noel Heatori for help kindly rendered.

                                     (Abstract.)
 Thi     object of this paper is to develop the methods and generalise
the    conclusions of Mr. Francis Galton's work on ' Natural Inherit
ance.'      It  endeavours to show the wide field which a purely statisti
cal (as distinguished from a mechanical or physiological) theory of
heredity may be made to cover.            In order to do this it is needful to
define certain biological terms in such a manner that they are capable
of quantitative measurement, the symbols in terms of which they
are expressed being the standard-deviations, correlation-coefficients,
and regression-coefficients already well known from the labours of
Mr. Galton. The fundamental assumption made is that the distribu
tion of variation in any organ or characteristic follows the normal
law.      It is pointed out that this distribution, although very general,
is not absolute, and that, especially in cases of disease and heredity,
we require the consideration of skew-variation and skew-correlation.
    The quantities mathematically defined are variation, correlation,
natural, sexual and reproductive selection, heredity, regression, and
panmixia.        The definitions given agree in part with those already
adopted by      Mr.   Galton or Professor Weldon.       At some points they
extend or develop the ideas of those naturalists.             In particular the
author     finds   it necessary  to emphasise    the distinction  between two

 types of sexual selection restating from tribal and individual tastes,
 and leading respectively to a preferential and an assortative mating.
 The mathematical measurement of the latter (which seems a sensible,
 if small, quantity in the case of stature in man) is not quite identi
 cal with Darwin's conception of sexual selection, which approximates
 rather to preferential mating. The memoir develops Bravais' theory
 of correlation, determining the probable error of the determination
of a coefficient of correlation and the relation of a coefficient of
correlation to coefficients of variation.              The analytical forms for
two, three, or four correlated variables are given, and a proof of
 Edge worth's theorem.           These results are applied to the problems
of correlation in local races, of biparental inheritance, collateral
                                                                                      '
inheritance, morbid inheritance, and some problems in ' cross
heredity.       Finally, the problem of panmixia is dealt with.                  The
following results among others are deduced ; they are, however,
to be considered in each         case as probable only, and matter for closer
investigation      and    observation*  :—
     (n.) It is improbable that coefficients of correlation are absolutely
constant for local races.
     (b.) To judge by stature, the father, in the case of both sons and
daughters, is markedly more prepotent in inheritance than the mother.
Heredity is thus markedly stronger in the male than the female line.
     (c.) Fathers of sons are less variable than fathers of daughters.
Very tall or very short fathers have more daughters than sous.
     (d.) There is a sensible sexual selection in man.
     (e.) There is some evidence of reproductive selection.

 in the direct line.
     (j.) Elder sisters are shorter and less variable than younger
 sisters.

                                (Abstract.)
   Leucocytes whose finer structure is to be examined must be fixed
by reagents, of which the best is sublimate ; drying is unreliable, as
it does not preserve details of structure.
   It is impossible to divide leucocytes into a haemal variety and a
ccelomic variety, for (1) lymphocytes are the precursors of all forms ;
(2) leucocytes are not present in the blood in early foetal life ; (3) they
are constantly passing from blood to connective tissue and vice
versa; (4) the mitotic reproduction of leucocytes takes place almost
entirely in adenoid tissue. It is only their size which prevents the
largest hyaline, eosinophile, and basophile cells from appearing in
the blood.
   M. Heidenhain's    observations on the relative positions of nucleus
and centrosomes    are correct, but his theory of the original equality of
the  "               "
       organic radii will not hold. These main threads of the mitoma
are connected at every microsome by subsidiary threads. The
nucleus does not lie free in the interfilar spaces, but its linin net
work is connected with the cytomitoma, and the two are perhaps to
a certain extent interchangeable.     This would explain the variety of
arrangement of the nuclear chromatin, and the co-ordination in
movement of the cell-body and nucleus.
   The shape of the nucleus has no relation to the presence or absence
of granules in the cell- body, but depends on (1) the relative sizes of
the cell-body and nucleus (according to M. Heidenhain's law) ; (2) the
position of the centrosomes ; (3) the condition of rest or movement
of the cell.
   All varieties of leucocytes are merely stages in the development of
a tissue.    They may be divided for convenience, and with regard to
the presence or absence of granules, into three main groups, the
Hyaline, Acidophile, and Basophile. These forms are all derived
from the lymphocytes, which are the daughter-cells derived from the

mitosis of all leucocytes except the largest granular forms. The
lymphocyte develops into the small hyaline forms, from which the
three groups branch off.
   I. The cells may remain Hyaline, and attain their maximum
development in such cells as the large phagocytes of the alimentary
canal or the giant-cells of bone marrow.         In this case they remain
sluggishly amoeboid, their centrosomes        are very evident, and the
cytomitoma    and  microsomes,  while visible, are not easily made out.
   II. In the Acidophile group are included the so-called neutrophile
find amphophile cells, which are really oxyphile, and the eosinophile
or coarsely granular cells.    In the transition forms from the small
hyaline cells to the oxyphiles the mitoma of the cell-body becomes
more visible, and it is this rather than the presence of granules which
gives rise at first to the finely granular appearance.       The granules
are simply   the  microsomes   of the mitoma.     In  the transition forms
between the oxyphile and eosinophile cells some of the microsomes
become larger and take up acid dyes and iron-haematoxylin better
than others, and when the large eosinophils are reached the threads
of the mitoma have become thicker, and also take up iron-haema-
toxylin.   The microsomes in the eosinophils vary greatly in size ;
they are arranged subradially, with the largest microsomes usually at
the periphery.     In this group the centrosomes are well seen, better
in the eosinophiles than in the oxyphiles.
   III. The cells of the Basophile group vary immensely in size and
shape.    The nucleus is generally ellipsoidal, except when the cells
are actively amoeboid, probably because the cell- body is usually
relatively large. As the cells increase in size the amount of basi-
chromatin in the nucleus becomes increased out of proportion to the
size of the nucleus. This has no relation to mitosis, which has only
once been observed in these cells.        The centrosomes can be seen
fairly easily in the smaller rounded forms. In the larger forms
they are difficult to make out, and it seems possible that there may be
several subordinate centrosomes. These cells are derived from the small
hyaline forms by an increased visibility of the mitoma, and an
increase in size of the microsomes, which are at first usually very
irregular in size, and do not exhibit metachromasia with methyl-
blue. As the cells become larger, so generally do the granules; they
 become more uniform, but are never all quite of one size.           Meta
chromasia becomes more constant, and the mitoma more evident,
 especially in those cells which are moving, or which are greatly-
 branched . The staining of the microsomes is never quite the same
as that of the nuclear chromatin.
    The granules of leucocytes are therefore not products of the meta
 bolic activity of the cell embedded in a structureless protoplasm, as

therefore plasmatic, and not paraplastic.              They are probably con

microsomes probably consist of nucleo-albumins, the basophiles being
richer in phosphorus than the eosinophiles.

is affected from the kind of leucocytes present in excess in the
blood.

                                  (Abstract.)
   The principal results of my examination of the life-history of
Lichenopora have already been communicated to the Royal Society.*
I then showed that embryonic fission occurs as a normal process in
the development of that genus, as of Crisia.             The general growth of
the colony and of the embryo was described, and attention was
called to the remarkable fact that the embryonic processes which
culminate in the production of the entire first brood of larvae com
mence in the earliest stage of the formation of the colony itself.
   The present paper contains a fuller account of the processes
 indicated above, with the addition of some new details. Statistics
are given to show that the zooecium which produces the primary
embryo, from which the larvae are developed by a process of em
bryonic fission, is, in the great majority of cases, one of the first two
blastozoites of the colony.          The position assumed by these two
zooecia depends on the direction in which the primary zooecium has
become curved ; and " left-handed
                                            " and "                  " colonies
                                                        right-handed
are accordingly distinguished.        The relation of the young ovicell to
the fertile zooecium has been observed for the first time. The forma
tion of the ovicell commences with the occlusion of the orifice of the
fertile zooecium ; and this takes place in such a way that the body-
cavity of the zooecium remains continuous, near the orifice, with the
cavity of the ovicell. The polypide has previously degenerated, and
the embryo, contained in an investment, the " embryophore," has
passed up to the neighbourhood of the orifice, still attached to the
                       * '

fertile brown body. The latter can be easily detected in stained
colonies at this stage, and its remains may be seen even in colonies
which have been mounted dry. Its poaition differs from that of the-
ordinary brown bodies, which are situated at a deeper level in the
colony.
   The communication between the fertile zooecium and the young
ovicell permits of the passage of the embryonic structures into the
cavity of the latter.      The fertile brown body, which remains a con
spicuous object for a long period, is usually found in the ovicell, not
far from the zooecium in which it was produced ; and it forms a kind
of centre from which the lobes of the branching embryophore pass
out.    The primary embryo has meanwhile divided repeatedly, so
that the ovicell contains a large number of secondary embryos, some
of which are already developing into larvae, and others are still
undergoing division.
   A definite relation thus exists between the size of the colony and
the extent to which the ovicell or the embryo has developed, although
variation in these respects occurs within rather wide limits.               This
fact is illustrated by series of measurements.
   The healthy development of the embryos is shown to depend on the
functional activity of the polypides, which no doubt nourish the
developing larvae. There are reasons for believing that complete
degeneration of the polypides does not ordinarily take place at a time
when their activity is required for the nourishment of the ovicell.
   Some details are given with regard to the changes which take
place in the older colonies, and particularly with regard to the
secondary thickening of the calcareous matter and to the develop
ment of new broods of embryos.
   It would hardly be possible to find two Cyclostomes which are
more different from one another than are Crisia and IAchenopora.
The fact of the occurrence of embryonic fission in both genera,
accompanied as it is by complete dissimilarity of details, may be taken
as affording strong grounds for believing that the existence                  of
embryonic fission is a fundamental phenomenon                    which occurs
throughout     the  Cyclostomata.

    Flame Spectra observed at Swedish Bessemer Works."                       By
        C. J. LuNDSTROM, Ortofta, Sweden.                   Communicated by
       Professor W. N. Hartley, F.R.S.                   Received April 1, —
       Read June 20,— Revised October 18, 1895.
                                    Introduction.
    As no examinations of the Bessemer name from Swedish steel works
 had been previously made,           I resolved, some years ago, to devote
attention to this subject,     in order to see to what extent the Bessemer
spectrum in Sweden differs from those of other countries, and partly
to ascertain whether the spectroscope might be of any practical use in
                               "
examining the Bessemer blow."
    My observations were made at the following Bessemer works : —
Nykroppa, Hagfors, Langshyttan, and Ulfshyttan and partly also at
Domnarfvet.
    Embracing the present opportunity,           I  beg to be allowed to express
my   thanks     to  all the managers    and   engineers of these works for the
courtesy    I   have met with.       Especially    I am gratefully indebted to
Mr. Martin Nisser, the manager of the Klosters Iron Works, for the
interest he has shown in procuring a spectroscope adapted to the
requirements of this investigation, which he placed at my disposal.

            Flame Spectra observed at Swedish Bessemer Works.                   77
     This instrument      was a Hofmann's       " spectroscope   ii vision directe
avec six prismes,"      from  Paris,   consisting  of a  collimator, six prisms,
a telescope, 0ne eye-piece, and a side tube with a scale.                The scale
is lighted by a lamp, and the degrees of the scale are reflected by the
first prism into the eye-piece, which can be moved by a screw so that
the different parts of the spectrum may appear in the field succes
sively.
     To  show the excellence of the instrument, the following facts may
be noted.       It divides the line 6 of the sun spectrum. The distance
between Li a. (6705) and Na a. (5895) was 41°. The same band
showed on the scale the following values : —423, 42-0, 42-5, 42'0, 42'0,
42-2. By means of an interpolation curve, the wave-lengths of this band
 were determined to be as follows :— 5351, 5354, 5350, 5354, 5354, 5352,
 The interpolation curve was made by numerous observations on the
 lines of the sun spectrum, the wave-lengthg of which were taken
 from Angstrom's atlas. By means of this instrument all the spectra,
 except those of Hagfors and Nykroppa, were observed.                 The spectra
 of Hagfors and Nykroppa were examined by a spectroscope of
 General Wrede's construction, belonging to the Royal Swedish
 Academy of Science, which instrument proved, however, to be less
 suitable for my investigations.
                               "        "
     During the Bessemer blow there are, as is well known, three
  periods.
      The first is the so-called " slag period," during which in all cases
  there is only a bright continuous spectrum visible. Just at the begin
                                         "
  ning of the second period, the boil," there appears at all the works
  under mv observation, with exception of Langshyttan, first the sodium
  line, and then a beautiful band-spectrum, which gradually becomes
  more distinct. It attains its full brilliancy after the entrance of the
  third period or " fining stage," and then its brightness gradually fades
  until, upon complete decarbonisation, it vanishes. It is this spectrum
  that in the following pages         I  propose to designate the
                                                                       " Bessemer
  spectrum," and to particularise the Langshytte, Domnarfs, Nykroppa,
  Hagfors, or Ulfshytte spectrum according to the name of the works
  where the spectra were studied.
      At Langshyttan, as at several other works, the flame seems during
                                                   "      "
  the transition from the first period to the boil to assume a more or
  less intensely blue colour which soon vanishes, after which the colour
  becomes more of a milky white appearance.
     This blue flame gave at Langshyttan a beautiful spectrum, which
  appeared suddenly and almost immediately in its full brightness,
  after which it rapidly lost its coloar and changed to a common
  Bessemer spectrum.        This   I propose to call the spectrum of the blue
 flame, and to describe          it  separately.    At Ulfshyttan the metal
   " blown " contained a comparatively very large percentage of silicon

with a small proportion of manganese,                                     and the spectrum differed
very materially from the other spectra.                                 I  shall therefore describe it
separately.
   I now pass to the description of Bessemer spectra from Langs-
hyttan, Domnarfvet, Nykroppa, and Hagfors.      These in general
have the same characteristics, and only in unimportant details do
they differ from each other.

  The     Bessemer  spectrum carl conveniently be divided into five
groups, a,  f),
              7,   e.   The group a. refers to the red field on the less
                        c,
refrangible side of the sodium lines.         In this group the Langs-
hytte spectrum has, in addition to the distinct Li line 6707, only
three lines or narrow bands that appear on a light continuous back
ground.    This continuous background, on 'which the whole spectrum
appears, extends towards the violet side as far as the eye can see (H),
and towards the red side with      agradually fading brightness, so that
the Li line appears on a dark ground.
   The double Na line 5893 appears with a dazzling brightness, and
almost darkens the adjacent parts of the field.      When the spectrum
has gained its full development, the Na group often appears as                                  a
broad bright band divided by a reversed line.        On the right side of
the Na line three groups appear,       7,   that are sharply defined by
                                           /3,    S,
the green bands /8,, 71, and <v   These have such effulgence that the
adjacent parts or the continuous background towards the violet are
made to appear as      there were absorption-bands at these places.

   In the group       flu andft,   are bands, the brightness of which
                                   /3a

three bright bands that fade away towards the red.        In the group S
there are four equally bright bands that seem to fade towards either
side; the shade behind this group is not so distinct as behind
the groups ft and 7.
   The other bands of the spectrum, forming the group e, do not
appear so distinctly.   Usually e, and ca appear, but it is very difficult
to determine with accuracy their positions, on account of their short
duration and their want of brilliancy.                      I
                                             have not been able to put
down the position of <=3more than twice and it has been impossible
to discover the lines and bands in the violet part of the spectrum.
   After the disappearance of the blue flame, there were only the Na
and Li lines visible and the bands ft and 7 of this spectrum.           A
minute after the beginning of the " boil," ft and 7 appeared, and
also traces of   <5,and a minute afterwards the spectrum was fully
developed.    Lastly appeared the bands of the group e, and these
were the first to disappear when the proportion of carbon was l-l and
1-2 per cent. Then      disappeared before the other lines of the group
                          S3
when the carbon was about 0-70 per cent., and generally all the
groups had vanished when the carbon had passed down to 0-40 and
       <5
0-35 per cent.
                                                                       "

brighter, and more distinct than during the previous
                                                         " blow."      The

other groups, and this      the case even when the "blow" has con

        Flame Spectra observed at Swedish Bessemer             Works.       81
however, from the Langshytte spectrum. The line 6252 in the
group a. was not present ; the two faint lines in the group /3 and the
group e appeared very indistinctly, and no new lines or bands were
perceived.
             The Nykroppa Spectrum.    (Fig.   1,   spectrum   II.)
   The wave-lengths of the lines and bands are given in the following
table. They are arranged in the same manner as in that of the
Langshytte spectrum.
    This spectrum has a different aspect in the region of red rays from
                                               I
that of the Langshytte spectrum, which, as have mentioned already,
only consists of three red lines on a bright background. Here the
group a consists of a faint continuous spectrnm which extends from
the Li line, and gradually becomes more conspicuous and splendid
towards the more refrangible rays. The band 6255 — 6211 is defined
on the less refrangible edge by this continuous spectrum, and on the
more refrangible by a dark background extending to 6028 on which
appear the line 6174 and the band 6106 — 6079.                 I
                                                             cannot state
positively whether these bands are really bright bands or if they
only form part of the continuous spectrum, and are flanked by
absorption bands, especially as the brightness of these bands is not
greater than that of the continuous spectrum before the
                                                              " boil."
    From 6028 the splendour of the background gradually becomes
more intense towards the Na line.            On that background there
appear sometimes the lines 5972 and 5023.          They are, however, of
 short   duration.
    The tcroup /3 shows this difference, that the continuous spectrum
extends behind     /32 to 5568 before we notice the dark shade which         is
 its usual termination.     In addition, some lines appear that were not
 observed at Langshyttan.
  7    and
         c    contain respectively each one line on the dark background
 near the preceding group, which lines were not observed at Langs-
 hvttan.     The group seems sometimes to be only a bright nebulo
                         e
 sity,  but gradually there appear four very distinct bands.
    The order in which the different bands appeared could here be
 better observed than at Langshyttan, where the spectrum of the blue
 flame passed into the ordinary Bessemer spectrum.        Just when the
         "
 "boil begins, a faint yellow line appears very distinctly on the bright
 continuous background.       Naa (5895), and then the second (5889) of
 the Na lines, and at the same time the Lialine, then almost simultane
 ously the red band of the group a. and the green ones fti, ^/u £,, which
 remain during the whole
                              " blow." Lastly appear the lines 5972 and
 5923 and the bands of the group e, these are also the first to
 disappear. The disappearance of the bands          is
                                                     generally contrary to
 the order of their appearance.

continuous spectrum, then the Na and Li lines. Next came the
most important bands of the groups    7, and c.  The red region of

 When the converter was hot the appearance         of the group varied
 incessantly, now being that of a bright band from 5585 to 5718,
 .shading away towards the red, now being a much narrower one from
 5585 to 5608. The broad band often divides for a moment into two, an
 absorption line 5625 flashing out alternately with what appears to be
 an absorption band 5648—5600.      If the converter was not so hot,             ft,
 only was visible as usual, 71 was always visible, and sometimes also
 73.  Of the group  e  there was nothing seen but the brilliant edge
 5153.
     The Nykroppa Bessemer pig-iron generally contained —
                    0-70    per cent. of combined carbon,

   Two samples of this pig-iron were examined for manganese     the          ;
first on one occasion when the group     had appeared very faintly,
                                                c
and the other one when four bands of the group  had been distinctly

visible.  The result was that the former sample contained a little
more manganese than the latter, which proves that the changes in
the proportion of manganese have no effect upon the more or less
distinct appearance of the group e.
                            The Haafors Spectrum.
  This spectrum differs from the former only in some small details.
The group a consists here of  broad bright band with distinct limits
                                 a
X = 6277 and   = 6179. This band has on the side of less refrangible
                X
rays the continuous background of rays, but on the more refrangible
side of 6179   has, as
               it        seems, an absorption band, which extends to
                        it
the narrow and bright band 6106 (Li/3) and then the bright background
adjoins   itagain. In the group      there
                                      /3        new line visible 5860
                                                    is   a
(Mn303), and the band 5712 appears more distinctly limited already at
5585. The Nykroppa and Hagfors spectra fully agreed, except in the
following details, namely, the group     of the latter spectrum was
                                            e
more often indistinct, and that    never exhibited so many bands as
                                     it
the former.
  When the converter was being warmed there appeared certain
bands, which were not visible during the "blow," viz., a faint
narrow band with    \= 5923, and a distinct one with   = 5525 — 5491
                                                                 X

                            The Manganese      Oxide Spectrum.
      Simmler proved that compounds of manganese heated in a Bnnsen
 flame give a band spectrum.              Lichtenfels and Watts gave evidence
 of the Bessemer spectrum being for the most part derived from
 manganese oxide.             In order to ascertain which lines were to be
 attributed to Mn203,           I examined the spectrum of manganese oxide
 belonging to the department of physics in the University of Upsala.
 Following the method of Watts, I used puro manganese chloride on
 a platinum wire in the oxyhydrogen flame.                 The spectrum observed
 agreed very well with the spectrum described by Watts and Lecoq.*
 But Lecoq has described three manganese oxide spectra, obtained by
 passing the electric spark of an induction coil from a platinum
 electrode throngh a solution of pure manganese chloride, which
  formed the negative pole.
       The spectrum obtained with the short spark is a compound one.
  consisting of both lines and bands.             The line spectrum, however, is
  more developed and agrees more closely with Thalen's manganese
  spectrum. He also obtained the same spectrum by making use of
  a moderate sized spark nearest to the negative pole, but at a short
  distance from the surface of the fluid it gradually passed into the
   spectrum the position of the lines of which are given in the table of
   wave-lengths.         It contains both lines and bands. Some of the lines
   are absent, and several new bands have appeared.                      Lecoq's third
   manganese       -oxide    spectrum     may     be   observed    when      manganous
   chloride is heated in a Bunsen flame.                  It consists of the most
   important      bands   of  the last-mentioned     spectrum.
       Watts, in his table of the Mn203 spectrum, has given the positions
   of only the bands and lines which fully agree with his Bessemer and
    Spiegel iron spectra. It is, therefore, only natural that                   I should
    have observed by means of the same method a greater number of
    lines in the green region of the spectrum.

   The most distinctly defined edge of each band was measured, and
this lay on the side towards the violet.
   The band 73 = 5264 of my Langshytte spectrum occurs in all the
spectra of Lecoq.         have . found
                          I               not only in the spectrum men

tioned above, produced by means of the flame of detonating gas, but
also in a manganese oxide spectrum, which was obtained at the
mining school at Filipstad by passing pure manganous chloride into
the flame of a gasoline lamp. It            surprising that Watts has not
                                                    is
pointed out this band, or found that          agrees with the line 5269 in
                                                     it
his Bessemer spectrum.
   Itis   true that this band, by comparison with other bands of the
c group, seems a little fainter in the Mn303 spectrum than in the
Bessemer spectrum, and that one may therefore suppose that some
line of another element          present in the same place, but am not
                                  is                                         I
able to agree with Watts in assigning this line to iron, on account of
the few concordant iron lines.
   at (X = 6252) fully agrees with my Mna03 spectrum, and with that
of Lecoq, but not with that of Watts.
   But, on the other hand, there           in the Langshytte spectrum a
                                                is
narrow line (6176) which corresponds to 6178 in Watts' MniO3
spectrum, but which does not agree with the bands observed by Lecoq
and myself.     It is, however, very difficult to decide how the matter
really stands, but most likely              owing to the well-known fact
                                             it     is
that MniOi changes its aspect according to conditions of tempe
rature under which        it  produced, several bands which are visible
                                 is
at first fade away,    while others  which at first are obscure grow more

  and    more   distinct.    63 (X =  .5002)   is also    most   probably   due to
   Mn3O3, as also the other bands of the c-groups of both the Langshytte
  spectrum and that of Nykroppa.               The band 5226 might also be
  considered to be derived from the same source.
     Note. — Since the publication of Professor Hartley's two papers on
  " The Spectrum of Metallic Manganese, of Alloys of Manganese, and
  of Compounds containing that Element," and on " The Spectroscopic
  Phenomena and Thermo-Chemistry of the Bessemer Process," ' Phil.
  Trans.,' vol. 185, A, p. 1029, I have become aware that the bands
  originally attributed by Watts to manganese oxide, and which              I have
  described as Mn,03, are now for the most part to be ascribed to
  metallic manganese. — July 4, 1895. — C. J. L.
                             The Phosphorus Spectrum..
     Phosphorus is known to yield a spectrum, the most brilliant band
  of which has the same position as Slt and this may serve as an expla
  nation of the fact that Sx appears much more distinctly in the Bessemer
  spectrum than in the MnaOa spectrum. Salet* and Lecoqt have
  given descriptions and measurements of this spectrum. I observed
  it in the Physical Laboratory at the University of Upsala. A current
  of hydrogen was passed over a piece of yellow phosphorus, and
  through a long glass tube into the air where the hydrogen was burnt.
  To cool the flame, after the manner of Salet, it was surrounded by a
  current of cool air. The flame thereby appeared green, and gave in
  the spectroscope the band spectrum of phosphorus. The bands of the
  spectrum varied in breadth, so that        I  obtained an almost continuous
  spectrum with a large piece of phosphorus, while a smaller piece
  gave bands that shaded away gradually as the piece of phosphorus
  wasted away. By using a piece of phosphorus so proportioned that
  the most important bands were as narrow as possible, so as to be dis
  tinctly observed, I made a series of measurements in such a manner
  that only the maximum of light in each band was recorded. As,
  however, these bands shade away both towards the least and the
  most refrangible rays, the numbers quoted cannot be very exact.
                                  I
     In the following table give the values of X obtained by Salet,
  Lecoq, and myself; the figures refer to the maximum of light of the
  strongest bands, and, in addition, I give the bands of the Bessemer
  spectrum agreeing with them.

remarked that there has not been noticed any greater brightness in
these bands e, and     in the Bessemer spectrum, than in the Mn203
                                  /J,
spectrum.    The presumption that phosphorus should contribute to
the Bessemer spectrum is incompatible with the fact that Bessemer
metal generally contains higher percentage of phosphorus than the
pig-iron from which                        is a
                            made, which circumstance has led metal
                                      it
lurgists to suppose that all the phosphorus of the pig-iron remains in
the final product. Analyses of the iron and slag made during
different periods of a "blow " prove, however, that the proportion of
phosphorus varies, so that one may be justified in. supposing that
phosphorus may contribute to the heat of oxidation.
   Analyses made by Kessler give the following proportions of phos
phorus in the metal —             :

    Kupelwieser has also calculated the absolute quantities of the
 elements of a charge, and has found phosphorus, T47 kgr., in the
 pig-iron, and 1*34 kgr., in the final product, of which there conse
 quently remains 0.13 kgr., which has partly passed into the slag and
 partly through the mouth of the converter.

 to give the spectrum of this element volatilises, even under conditions

 where the percentage of phosphorus in the metal is small, ought not
 then to be considered as too bold a presumption.
                             The Lithium Spectrum.
    Lia (X = 6705) is found in every spectrum. Besides Li/3           (X = 6102
 according to Thalen, X = 6098 according to Huggins*)               may be con
 sidered as agreeing with the sharp line 6097 in Watts' Bessemer
 spectrum, and the band 6106 in Hagfors spectrum, and possibly it
 may form part of the band 6106 — 6079 in the Nykroppa spectrum.
                           The Potassium Spectrum.
    A spectrum produced by means of a potassium salt in the electric
spark gives a line spectrum, -which, according to the measurements
made by Lecoq, chiefly consists of the groups a, with X = 5831 —
5801—5783, /3 with X = 5355—5336—5319 and, 7 with X =
6946 — 6913.    At Nykroppa 7 has been observed at least once. It
may, therefore, be admitted as something quite certain that the
groups in the Nykroppa and Hagfors spectra, 5832 — 5797 — 5774
and 5338 — 5318, are derived from potassium, and likewise possibly
the lines 5823 and 5781 in the Langshytte spectrum.
                       The Calcium Oxide Spectrum.
    Of this spectrum Lecoq has fine drawings and careful measure
ments. The most important bands are a with X = 6265 — 6202 — 6181,
ft with X = 5543—5517, and 7 with X = 5933.
    With traces of CaO on a platinum wire, heated in a Bunsen flame,
there will appear only the two first bands faintly, and of these /i
remains longest. I heated MnCli, together with traces of CaCl2, ou
a platinum wire in a gasoline lamp, and then observed the red band
6277 — 6179, and faintly the band 5532, as well also the Mns03
spectrum which was observed in the Hagfors spectrum. Likewise, I
obtained with a larger quantity of CaCl2, and a smaller proportion of
MnCli, quite that spectrum which appeared before the " blow " at
Hagfors, and in which CaO/s appears distinctly, and CaOy appears
faintly; the band 5532, and the appearance of the band 6255 — 6211
in the Nykroppa spectrum might also be due to traces of CaO.
                          The Magnesium Spectrum.
   Another explanation of the band 5532 in the Nykroppa and Hag
fors spectra, which also should explain the line 5712, is given by
            * See Kayser,

the spectrum of magnesium.                   According to Liveing and Dewar,*
Mg gives       in the    arc   the   following     values for X: 5711, 5528, 5183,
5172, 5167, 4704. The line 5711 appears brightly, and generally
very distinctly, just when a little piece of magnesium has been
placed in the arc ; it then rapidly diminishes, and by degrees
becomes      very faint, or completely disappears.                    The same line
appears    also    in   the    spark   when     taken    from   a  solution  of MgCla.
In the spark all lines mentioned above are to be foand. The
groups 5183 — 5172 — 5167 that correspond to 6 in the sun spectrum
appear, however, comparatively fainter than in the arc,f on account
of which one might conclude that with another temperature and
another pressure the lines 5710 and 5529 would remain longest,
that is to say, that these would differ from the b lines, and by
this one might also explain the reason why 5712 appears more dis
tinctly in the Hagfors spectrum than in the Nykroppa spectrum.
                           The Magnesium Oxide Spectrum.
   Magnesium oxide has the sharpest edge of its brightest band at
      J
5006, and corresponds better with the faint band 5002 in the Langs-
hytte spectrum than with the Mna03 band, to which also its origin
might be attributed.
                              The   Barium Oxide Spectrum.
   This spectrum has a band with X = 5536, which may. account for
 he line 5532 in the Nykroppa spectrum.

       The Spectrum of           the  Blue Flame.       (Fig. 1,  spectrum   IV.)
   This spectrum was visible only for a few seconds during each
" blow," and was
                         consequently difficult to deal with. Often when it
appeared the instrument was not properly adjusted, or, owing to
parallax, no reliable values could be obtained for the position of the
lines. The spectrum being of so short a duration, there was no time
to write down more than one or two lines during a " blow."                           It
seems, however, to be of interest in more than one respect, and on
this account        I   have examined the spectrum as well as circum
stances allowed, only making one or two observations of the faintest
and most rarely appearing of the twenty-eight bands and lines that
are visible.       In the following table the results of these observations
are given.

spectrum was continuous. In the former case the boil wao hotter
than in the latter. Experience has shown that the blue flame appears
 earlier when the pig-iron is strong in silicon, independently of the
 charge being cold or hot. And if the treatment is basic, the blue
flame will appear sooner than if it is acid, other conditions being
 the same.
                                 Comparison    Spectra.
      That several of the bands that are to be found in the spectrum
 of the blue flame agree with the Bessemer spectrum is evident,
 and likewise that these are owing to manganese oxide. From the
 fact that the more refrangible rays relatively grow in brightness as
 the temperature becomes higher,* one might suppose that the bands
 of the group e with X = 4986 and X = 4963, and possibly even
 other bands, are owing to manganese oxide. The spectrum which,
  other than that of manganese oxide, agrees best with that of the
  bine flame is that of silicon.
                                The Silicon Spectrum.
      Saletf obtained a band spectrum by passing hydrogen over silicon
  chloride, and surrounding the hydrogen flame with an air current in
  the same manner as in the production of the phosphorus spectrum
  mentioned above.          I have been unable to decide whether it is owing
  to elementary silicon or to any of its compounds.                 I  have tried to
  produce this spectrum by Salet's method, but without success.
      The wave-leugths of' the middle of the bands, thus observed by
   Salet, approximate closely to the most important bands which occur in
   the spectrum of the blue flame, viz., a. 522, /3 545, 7 501, S 567, and
   < 487'5 (though faintly), Sij
                                       (X = 522) agrees as to its position with
   the MniOi band c3 (X = 5227) ; that in the blue flame appears with
   greater brightness than the other bands of the c group.
       In addition to these complete agreement is also to be found be
   tween the bands 481 and 474 in the Si-spectrum and those of the
   blue flame 4809 and 4778, though it must be remarked that the band
   corresponding to Si, is fainter than those of the blue flame.
       There are other reasons, too, for the fact that silicon, or one of its
   compounds, gives a spectrum where the blue flame appears.                   During
    the slag-period really nothing takes place but an oxidation of Si and
    Mu, which process of combustion occasions a considerable increase
    of the temperature.       These elements having passed completely into
    the slag, the carbon begins to burn, and then the second period,

the " boil," ensues.        It is possible that at the transition between
these periods, the temperature may be higher than at any other time
during the " boil," and part of the silicon may be vaporised and thus
give this spectrum.
     It would be reasonable to suppose that this spectrum should be
chiefly owing to carbon or one of its compounds, but                  I  have found
no agreement between this spectrum and those attributed to carbon.
The origin of the other bands and lines of the spectrum of the blue
flame I have not been able to find out.                 Sodium shows a certain
agreement with the Na-lines (according to Thalen*), 5687— 56S1,
5155—5153, and 49S3, corresponding to 5G78, 5160, and 4986, but
against this presumption there stands the fact that Nap 6160 — 6154
does not occur.
     Though agreement as to position with some of the lines of other
elements       may be found, yet one cannot, upon the whole, determine
the origin of this spectrum.

                The Ulfshytte Spectrum.        (Fig. 1,  spectrum    III.)
     Having ascertained that in all probability silicon forms part of the
 spectrum of the blue flame, and on being informed that at TJlfshyttan
 the pig-iron used contains much silicon and little manganese,                          I
thought it would be interesting to examine the Bessemer flame by
means of the spectroscope.
     According to the information         given me by engineer Carl Carlsson
concerning the Bessemer process at Ulfshyttan,                 I  am able to com
municate the following facts concerning the composition of the
metal      : —

             Flame Spectra observed at Swedish Bessemer     Works.       93
appears very intense and constant with a very hot charge, and then
the proportion of silicon is abont 1 per cent, at its appearance. The
last tenths per cent, of the silicon are not oxidised nntil all the
carbon is burnt, the final product receiving a very high temperature.
Here the charge is thought to be too hot. With a normal charge
the proportion of carbon begins to decrease upon the appearance of
 the blue flame, but as long as this is visible (\ to 1£ minutes) the
 silicon decreases more rapidly and when the flame has become
 white, one may be quite certain that there is no large percentage of
 silicon left in the bath. The " blow " lasts abont 15 minutes. With
 extra cold charges the blue flame appears almost immediately after
 the erection of the converter and it becomes white very soon.
       I did not, however, succeed in observing a spectrum of the blue
flame under these conditions.         During my stay at Ulfshyttan the
 charge was never too hot but was always normal, and the blue flame
  appeared to the naked-eye more milky than at Llngshyttan, but it did
  not give any distinguishing spectrum. A Bessemer spectrum was,
                                                 "
  however, observed both during the " boil and during the decarbon-
  isation, and this differed essentially from the Bessemer spectra
 already described. This is a matter of course, as the silicon here
  takes the place of the manganese.
       Only the most brilliant manganese-oxide bands are to be found
  in this spectrum. The wave-lengths of the bands and lines appear
  in the table (p. 94).
       This spectrum ha3 quite a different appearance from that of the
  ordinary Bessemer spectra.        In the red field there are two strong
  bands which are always very distinctly visible.       Then there are two
   lines, one of which (X = 6088) seems, however, to coincide with the
  stronger edge of a faint band shading away towards the left (red)
  and on which the other line (A. = 6108) is to be found.              The
   yellowish-green field is chiefly remarkable for two bright bands,
   which seem to be separated by an absorption band. Between those
   bands and the sodium line some bright lines and a band are to be
   found and, in addition, other bands and lines which, however, rarely
   appear.
        To the left of the bands above mentioned there also appear on the
   back-ground of continuous rays a narrow band and several distinct
    lines or possible narrow bands.
        The order in which the lines appeared was somewhat different in
   different " blows."     The Na«- and Lia-lines invariably appeared first,
   and then the bands 5611 and 5580. Then on one occasion 5415 and
    5377 were observed before the other lines, while at another time
    5642 appeared after 5611 and 5580, after which the bands and lines
    presented themselves in the following order : 5814, 5784, 5867 ;
    5524, 5377, 5258, 5355, 5312, and lastly 5415, 5388, 5159, 5099.

                                           Comparison   Spectra.
       The origin of the chief portion in the Ulfshytte spectrum, have                         I
    been unable to ascertain. Though several lines and bands of ele
    ments that might be supposed to form that spectrum correspond
    with it to some extent, yet one cannot state positively that there is
    any connection between these spectra and the Ulfshytte spectrum.*
       Notwithstanding the small percentage of manganese in the metal
    used at these works there is no doubt that the most important of the
    manganese-oxide bands are to be found.      The most brilliant of them,
    ft, and /3J, certainly show   to some degree an appearance differing
    from that in the spectra mentioned above, a dark band separating
    them, and near to       the Ulfshytte spectrum shades away more to
                                    ft,
    the violet than to the red, but this    only due to a band of another
                                                        is
    element sitnated almost in the same place. The fact that two of
    these Mn203 bands are marked in the Ulfshytte spectrum as lines,
    only signifies that they are more sharply defined in this spectrum.
I     presume this      due to the small proportion of manganese in the
                               is
    metal and to the high temperature of the " blow " at these works.
       Presuming that the phosphorus-spectrum, described on page 87,
    could under favourable circumstances show sharply defined bands so
    that they more resemble lines situated where the maxima of light of
    the present bands are to be found, we have a plausible explanation of
    the lines 5258 and 5099, and possibly of the appearance of the band

5591 — 5580    in the Ulfshytte spectrum.        Lecoq* gives fainter bands
belonging to this spectrum at 5538 and 5436, which correspond to
the lines 5540 and 5433 which were observed on one occasion.
   The lines that      I have put in the fourth column of the table as
being derived from CaO and K. agree as with the position of lines in
other spectra which have been described as belonging to CaO aud K,
but cannot with certainty be ascribed to them. In the same manner
                                             \
it is uncertain whether the line with = 6108 belongs to Li or not.
   Finally, it may be remarked that 5642 agrees as to its position
with one of the strongest lines in the sulphur spectrum, and that
some of the bands in the band spectra of carbon have a certain
correspondence, though the strongest bands are missing.
   As to the spectrum during the warming of the converter, two
bands may be ascribed to CaO, the rest being of unknown origin.
   With increased knowledge of these band-spectra, and of the
effects of temperature and of pressure upon them,             I   hope that the
mystery which at present         surrounds   the cause of their appearance in
different works during different periods of the " blow

of stopping the " blow just as the Bessemer metal has so altered in
 composition as to contain no more than the desired percentage of
 carbon is more difficult to decide.
    At Nykroppa the object was to obtain a percentage of carbon as
 high as 085, at Hagfors as low as 0-15, while at Langshyttan it was
 required to be 065. During a considerable period the changes of the
                                      " blow " were observed, and the
 spectrum at the end of every                                               aspect
 of the characteristic groups were recorded as carefully as possible
                                                       "

    The following table (p. 98) shows the aspect of the spectrum under
 normal conditions.

 metal with 0'65 per cent, of carbon.          The result of the first twelve
 " blows" was metal containing 070, 0-50, l'50, 0-65, 0-65, 060, 065,
0-75, 065, 060, 0-65, 0'OO per cent, of carbon.
    It may be observed here that a group of rays sometimes disappears
 and soon appears again with diminished brightness.                 The error in
 the value of No. 3 was due to uncertainty in observing, but with
 some practice such an error may easily be avoided.

"Remarks on the Origin     of some of the Lines and Bands
     observed in the Spectra from Swedish Bessemer Works."
     By W. N. Hartley, F.R.S. Received April 1,— Read June
     20, 1*95.
   The observations made at various Bessemer steel works in Sweden,
as described in the preceding paper, are of particular interest, owing
to the number of accurate measurements of bands and lines observed
in different spectra of the flame during the progress of the " blow "
when different varieties of metal are operated upon.
   As the paper was written, as have been informed by Mr. Lund-
                                            I
strom, about nine years ago, the author was at a disadvantage in
being nnable to compare all his measurements with flame spectra of
known origin at high temperatures. Fallacious deductions are liable
to be drawn by referring bands and lines in the Bessemer flame to
only such spectra as have been obtained by the arc or spark.      This
was found to be the case in the study of oxyhydrogen blow-pipe
spectra   ('   Phil, Trans,,' vol. 185, A,       p.   161)   ;   hence
                                                                     I   propose   to offer

   Three bands in the green have been referred to phosphorus ; but
it is very difficult to admit that this element, in any form, can give
rise to their appearance in the Bessemer flame.             I have shown that
phosphorus pentoxide yields a spectrum of its own, and is not dis
sociated in the oxyhydrogen flame ; also that ferrous phosphate yields
the bands of phosphorus pentoxide.
   It is just possible that when the blast is charged with moisture a
compound cf phosphorus and hydrogen may be formed in the
presence of much carbon ; but, on the other hand, such compounds
show the green bands of phosphorus only when the flame is cooled,
and, as that which issues from the mouth of the converter is intensely
hot, the bands are scarcely likely to be visible.

    Neither silica, a silicate, nor a silicide, such as silico-spiegel, yields
bands or lines of silicon in the oxyhydrogen flame, but a highly
siliceous pig-iron, charged with much carbon, may react with water-
vapour contained in the blast during damp weather so as to evolve
carbon monoxide and the compound silicon hydride.              This, of course,

tions on this spectrum are desirable, and the hydrogen lines should
be particularly looked for ; but on the whole I am inclined to believe

that Mr. Lundstrom's deduction as to the origin of the " blue flame

 have been observed in the Crewe spectra; but their origin still
 remains a mystery.
 "On      the Variable Stare of the 8 Cephei Class."                      By J.
        Norman Lockyer, C.B., F.R.S.                   Received November 9,
        —Read November 21, 1895.
                                   Introductory.
    Professor E. C. Pickering, in his classification of the variable stars,
 which is based on a study of the light curves,* recognises two classes
 of variables having short periods.             His Class IV includes those
 variables, exemplified by S Cephei and /3 Lyrae, in which the light
 changes are not of very great range, and continue throughout the
 period.     Class V comprises those like Algol in which there is a
 temporary reduction of light at minimum, produced by the eclipse of
 the bright star by a relatively dark companion ; this explanation has
 since been established by spectroscopic investigations, which have
 shown that there is no change in the spectrum at minimum, and that
 there is an orbital movement of corresponding period.
    Both these classes are sharply distinguished from the variables of
 the Mira type, which form Pickering's Class II.                In this class of
 variables, as in Class IV, the light changes go on throughout the
 period, but the range of variation is generally much greater, and the
 periods are reckoned by months instead of days.               The variability is
 associated in this case with a fluted spectrum (Group II), and in a
 former communication I have shown that the phenomena can be ex
 plained on the supposition that there is one swarm (or more) of
 meteorites revolving in an elliptic orbit round a central swarm ; an
 increase of light at maximum occurring at periastron when the
 number of collisions is greatest.f
    It is probable that the variables of Class IV will require further
 subdivision, when their spectra have been more fully investigated.

Thus,    although   in regard to the general character of the light
changes,   /3 Lyrae must be included in this class, it stands apart from
the other members         which    have    so far been       spectroscopically ob
served   in having a spectrum which includes a number of bright
lines ; a detailed study of the spectrum has also shown* that the
lines are periodically doubled, and that part of the variability is due
to eclipsing, although the minima are not sharply marked like those
of Algol.
    Again, in the great majority of the variables of Class IV there is,
as a rule, a rapid rise to maximum, followed by a slower descent to
minimum, as in the variables of Class II.
    Excluding /3 Lyrae, which, as         I  shall show, is spectroscopically
 very different from the others so far examined, it will be convenient
 to refer to the remaining variables of Pickering's Class IV as those
of the S Cephei class, and it is with some of these that the present
 paper is concerned.
                         The Kensington Photographs.
    On attempting to continue the investigations of variability to
 which reference has been made, I found that the available spectro
 scopic data with regard to the S Cephei class were very meagre, and              I
 therefore determined to investigate the spectra photographically, so
 far as the means at my disposal would permit.                      The work was
 accordingly commenced at Kensington in the early part of 1894, and
 as some interesting facts have been already brought to light,              I  have
 decided, although the research is not yet completed, to communicate
 them to the Society, more especially as my instrumental means only
 permit the study of a small number of the stars.
    The instruments employed in the inquiry were those named A and
 B in a previous communication on the " Photographic Spectra of some
 of the Brighter Stars ;"t the former consists of a prism of 1\°, placed
 in front of a 6-inch photographic object-glass, and the latter of a
 prism of 45° used in conjunction with the same telescope.
    The spectra of most of the variables of this class are too faint to
 be photographed with the great dispersion of B, so that, in some
 cases, A has of necessity been solely employed.               Brief particulars as
 to the variability of the five stars, the spectra of which have been
 already photographed, and a statement of the number of photographs
  taken in each case, are given below.

   The spectra generally extend from near P to K.
                     Results of    the  Preliminary Discussion.
   A   careful examination of the negatives has been made by Messrs.
Fowler and Shackleton, and five very definite results have been
arrived at : —
    (1.) The spectra of      the  five variables      of this class which   have   been
          photographed      are practically identical.
   All  the spectra are seen to belong to Group               III/3 of my classifica
tion of the heavenly bodies.*
   It seems, therefore, that as our knowledge of the spectra of variable
stars advances, the association of a particular kind of spectrum with
a particular kind of variability becomes more and more evident.
This is only what we should expect, since I have adduced evidence to
show that the possibility of each particular kind of variability must
depend upon the state of condensation of the bodies involved.
   (2.) The five variables in question are stars of increasing temperature.
   The spectra are seen to very closely resemble                     the spectrum of
1 Qygni, and     I   have already stated the evidence which shows that
this star, unlike the sun, is increasing in temperature.               f
   We have thus revealed to us the fact that these variables, like the
other class which      I  have previously discussed,^ occupy places on the
ascending arm of the temperature curve.
   A portion of the spectrum of S Cephei, at the time of maximum, is
shown on p. 105, where it is compared with the spectra of 7 Cygni and
Arcturus. These have been enlarged about ten times from the
original negatives taken at Kensington.

  104                        Mr.   J.   Norman Lockyer.
     Taking Arcturus       as a  representative star of the solar type,* it       will
  be seen that although the spectra of 7 Cygni and 5 Cephei resemble
 it in showing a large number of dark lines, they differ considerably
 from it in point of detail. I shall return to the subject of these
  differences in a future paper.
     On the meteoritic hypothesis, then, the variables of this class are
 to be regarded as meteor-swarms not yet completely condensed, and
 this fact may prove of great importance in connexion with explana
 tions of the variability.
      (3.) There is a general weakening of          the continuous    spectrum as the
           light of the star decreases.
     This is shown by the fact that longer exposures                 are required to
 photograph the spectra when the variables are near the minima.
 With equal exposures, the negatives taken near minima are very much
 less dense than those taken at maximum, and even with the longest
 practicable exposures, when the highest dispersion is employed, the
 photographs obtained nearer minimum are relatively feeble. This has
  been especially noted in the case of S Cephei, one photograph of
 which was taken exactly at maximum and another only a short time
 after minimum.
     (4.) There are   no indicaticms       of bright-line radiation at the positions
           occupied by the lines     of hydrogen or helium at any part of the
           period in   the case   of these variables.
    The lines of hydrogen are dark in all cases, and no changes of
intensity such as might be brought about by an increased radiation
 at any time have been found in the photographs.                    A special search
has also been    made     for  bright    lines  in  the   positions of the lines of
helium and the associated gases, but none have been traced. Since
all of these lines occur in the spectra of such stars as Bellatrix, this
part of the inquiry was easy — it was only necessary to make direct
comparison of the negatives.
    (5.) There is  no visible doubling       of the lines  in any of the photographs.
    Unlike fi Lyrae, the variables now under consideration show no
doubling of any of the lines at any part of the period, so far as the
Kensington photographs give any information on the point.                        The
photograph of S Cephei (see fig.), taken exactly at maximum, shows
that there is no doubling at the time when such appearances might
be expected to be most marked.
    Hence, the conditions appear to be entirely different from those
which exist in the case of fi Lyrae, and on the meteoritic hypothesis
the stars are less condensed.

   Since the greater part of the foregoing was written, the results of
a photographic study of the spectrum of e Cephei, with special
reference to its movement in the line of sight, have been published
by Belopolsky.*     Belopolsky differs from me in classing the star as a
solar one, although he draws attention to numerous differences
between the spectrum of the star and that of the sun.
   He also finds, as I have found, that there is probably no change of
spectrum corresponding to the light changes, except a general change
of intensity.
   The photographs discussed in the present paper were taken by
Messrs. Baxandall, Shackleton, Butler, and Wardale, between Febru
ary and June, 1894.

   In Cayley we have lost one of the makers of mathematics, a poet
in the true sense of the word who made real for the world the ideas
which his ever fertile imagination created for himself.    He was the  •
Senior Wrangler     of my freshman's year at Cambridge, and     I well
remember to this day the admiration and awe with which, before the
                                                I
end of my first term just fifty-four years ago, had learned to regard
his mathematical powers.       When a little later I  attained to the
honour of knowing him personally, the awe was evaporated by the
sunshine of his genial kindness ; the admiration has remained un
abated to this day and his friendship has been one of the valued
possessions of my life.   While we mourn his departure from among
ns, we know with gratitude that he has left an imperishable monument
of his life's work in the grand edition of his mathematical writings
which the University Press of Cambridge gives to the world.       The
interesting and genuinely appreciative obituary notice of Arthur
Cayley, contributed by our colleague, Professor Forsyth, to the
'Proceedings of the Royal Society' for the present year, has been
reprinted as a preface to the eighth volume of his ' Collected Mathe
matical Papers,' which was published last August, rather more than

1895.]                     Presidents Address.                         109
half of it having    been passed   through the press by the author 'with
notes and references, and the remainder simply reprinted from the
original publications.    Matter for five more such volumes remains
to be reprinted.
    At the good old age of ninety-seven the veteran Franz Ernst
Neumann Las left us. He has been one of the most profound and
fertile of all the workers in mathematical physics of the 19th
century.       I remember with gratitude the admirable and suggestive
theorem* on electromagnetic induction which I learned in 1848, from
a first paper on the subject which he had communicated to the Berlin
Academy of Sciences, and which, translated into French, was pub
lished in the April number of that year of Liouville's ' Journal des
Mathematiques.'       That first paper and others which followed it on
the same subject, and his papers on the physical theory of light and
 on elasticity, are grand and permanently valuable contributions to
 science.
     The death of Huxley, one of my predecessors in the Presidential
 Chair of the Royal Society, takes from us a man who can ill be
 spared. During the fifty years since he sailed from England, as
 Assistant- Surgeon on board H.M.S. " Rattlesuake," bound for a
 surveying expedition in the southern seas, he had been a resolute
 and untiring searcher after truth, and an enthusiastically devoted
 teacher of what he learned from others and what he discovered by
 his own work in biological science.     His first contribution to science
 was a short note communicated, while he was still a student in the
                                      '
 Charing Cross Hospital, to the Medical Times and Gazette,' de
 scribing a structure in the root-sheath of hair, which has since borne
 the name of Huxley's layer. It was followed by papers on the blood
 corpuscles of the Amphioxus lanceolatus and on the Anatomy and
 Affinities of the Family of Meduscp,, for the British Association and
 the Royal Society ; and several other articles on various biological
 subjects, all describing some of the work of the leisure left him by
 his medical duties during his four years' cruise on board the
 " Rattlesuake," which were sent home by him to England, and
  published during his absence. It is to be hoped that the long series,
  thus so well begun, of papers describing skilful and laborious
  research by which knowledge was increased in every department of
  biology, will be given to the world in collected form as soon as pos
  sible. Even those purely scientific papers contain ample evidence
 that Huxley's mind did not rest with the mere recording of results
  discovered by observation and experiment : in them, and in the nine
  volumes of collected essays which he has left us, we find everywhere
  traces of acute and profound philosophic thought.        When he intro-

 duced the word agnostic to describe his own feeling with reference to
 the origin and continuance of life, he confessed himself to be in the
presence of mysteries on which science had not been strong enough
 to enlighten us ; and he chose the word wisely and well.           It is a
word, which, even though negative in character, may be helpful to
all philosophers and theologians. If religion means strenuousness in
 doing right and trying to do right, who has earned the title of a
religious man better than Huxley ?
    Another name literally of world-wide fame, Louis Pasteur, stands
next to the end of our list of losses.   Before he entered on his grand
biological work, Pasteur made a discovery of first-rate importance in
physics and chemistry — the formation of crystals, visibly right-handed
and left-handed, from a solution of racemate of soda and ammonia ; and
the extraction of ordinary tartaric acid and of a kind of tartaric acid not
previously known, from solutions obtained by picking out the crystals
separately and redissolving : the new kind of tartaric acid having the
property of producing the opposite rotatory effect on the plane of
polarisation of light to that produced by ordinary tartaric acid.
From 1848 to 1857 he was chiefly occupied with researches related
to the subject of that great discovery, as may be seen from the titles
of the first twenty-two of his papers in the Royal Society Cata
logue. His work of those nine years led up from Biot's fundamental
discovery of the dioptric helicoidal property of liquids and vapours,
to the enrichment of chemistry by the annexation of a new province
called stereochemistry, splendidly and fruitfully developed twenty
years later by Le Bel and Van't Hoff. Near the end of 1857 his twenty-
third paper appeared, three pages, in the ' Comptes Rendns,' " Sur la
Fermentation appelee lactique."      It shows that he had then entered
on the line of research to which he devoted the rest of his life, and by
which he conferred untold benefits on humanity and the lower animals.
     I
As had occasion to remark in my presidential address of last year,
Helmholtz had in his earliest work proved almost to a certainty
" that the actual presence of a living creature, vibrio, as he called
it, bacterium as we more commonly call it now, is necessary for
either fermentation or putrefaction."     Pasteur gave complete demon
stration of that conclusion, and early expanded it to vast and previously
undreamt of extensions of its application.       The first great practical
application  of his views was made by Lister, about 1863-65, then my
colleague in the University of Glasgow, now recommended by your
 Council as my successor to the Presidency of the Royal Society.
 From Pasteur's discoveries he was led to work out the principles of
 his antiseptic surgery, the practice of which he commenced in the
 Glasgow Royal Infirmary in the summer of 1865.

tation and putrefaction, but of a vast array of destructive blights

happening to plants and animals — vines, silkworms, birds, cattle, and
mankind — Pastenr was forced to take np the question, as of supreme
practical importance,
                         " Whence came these microbes, and what are
their antecedents ? " From warmth and moisture, as we see by turning
                       I
up a stone in a field, was told forty years ago by an Arran farmer well
 versed in the popular literature of the day. We are sometimes told
the same thing in scientific journals of 1895 under the more learned
disguise perhaps of abiogenesis, or the fortuitous concourse of atoms,
not tested by the calculus of probabilities.     Without wasting words
to prove theoretically that, while stones falling together may, as we all
 believe they have actually done, make a solar system with a habitable
planet or planets, they cannot make a man, or a microbe, or an organic
cell with its property of heredity, Pasteur set about practically to
trace the antecedents of every microbe he met with, and he found
for it in every case a living thing, whether in the air, or in water, or
in earth. During nearly all the latter part of his life and to the end
Pasteur devoted himself to biological research, and to vigorous
practical realisation of its benefits for the world.
   Turning now to the business of the Royal Society since our last
Anniversary Meeting,     I am glad to be able to report that excellent
                                       '
progress has been made with the Catalogue of Scientific Papers.'
Vol. xi, of the Catalogue, under authors' names, completing the
alphabet, is on the eve of issue, and the Supplementary Volume is
far advanced.
   The movement which led to the inception of the Catalogue dates
back forty years — to the first meeting of the British Association in
Glasgow, when Professor Henry, of Washington, communicated a
proposal for the publication of a catalogue of philosophical memoirs
scattered throughout the Transactions of Societies in Europe and
America, with the offer of co-operation on the part of the Smith
sonian Institution.
   The proposal was referred to a committee consisting of Mr. Cay-
ley, Mr. Grant, and Mr. Gabriel Stokes.          The year after, at the
Cheltenham meeting, this committee propounded a scheme for a
catalogue, embracing the mathematical and physical sciences, to
include both authors' names and subjects.           Besides Transactions
and Proceedings       of Societies, journals, ephemerides, volumes of
observations, and other collections not coming under these heads
were to be indexed.
   This scheme came before the Royal Society in March, 1857, in con
sequence of a request made by General Sabine at the instance of the
British Association.     Considerable discussion took place, and even
tually it was decided to prepare a manuscript catalogue of periodical
works in the Royal Society's library, to include all the sciences, tho
question of printing being deferred ; and to do the work at the

112                      Anniversary Meeting.                  [Nov. 30,
Society's sole charge. Subsequently it was resolved to extend the
catalogue to works in other libraries not included in that of the
Royal Society.
   In 1864 it was decided to offer the Cntalogue to Government for
publication, and in 1866 the printing of the first series of the Cata
logue, covering the period from 1800 to 1863, was commenced by the
Stationery Office.    The sixth and last volume of the series was
published in 1872. Two additional volumes, covering the period
1864—1873, were published in 1879. The Treasury then declined to
continue the publication of the Catalogue, which, however, was
undertaken by the Society, assisted by a sum of £1,000 voted by
Parliament towards the charges of publication of the decade 1874 —
1883. The unexpended portion of this grant was invested in a policy,
under which £1,000 will become available for the purposes of the
Catalogue in October, 1899.
   So far back as June, 1864, it was resolved by the Council that the
Catalogue according to authors should be followed by the immediate
publication of an index according to subjects.           Such an Index
Rerum was constantly      under consideration,   and  many plans for its
preparation have been discussed.       The work at last took practical
shape in 1893, when our Fellow Mr. Ludwig Mond most generously
presented a sum of £2,000 to the Society, in aid of the work of pre
paring the Catalogue and the Subject Index.           Out of this liberal
donation    there remains  unexpended    a sum    of £1,500.   A special
staff was organised, by whom more than 140,000 slips have now
been mounted and arranged in boxes, and of these over 46,000 have
already been provisionally prepared for press.       Since the last anni
versary, the department has to some extent been re-organised by the
Committee, women being now employed in the Index Rerum Depart
ment, and Miss Chambers having been entrusted with full control
over the whole. The total number of women employed in the two
departments including junior copyists is now twelve.
   It has, however, long been felt that the continuation of such a work
was almost beyond the resources of the Royal Society, and therefore
about two years ago a committee was appointed to take inio con
sideration a suggestion that the preparation of complete indexes to
scientific publications should be effected by international co-operation.
   This very important subject has continued to engage the attention
of the Council during the past year ; and the suggestion of inter
national co-operation having been recommended to Her Majesty's
Government for favourable consideration, official invitations have
been issued to an International Conference to be held in London in
July next.
   Meanwhile others have been equally aware of the great importance
 attaching to the indexing of literature, and only in September last

1895.]                         Presidents Address.                       113
an International Institute of Bibliography was established by Royal
 Decree in Brussels.
   Two gentlemen in that city, MM. Otlet and La Fontaine, have,
dnring the past half dozen years, devoted themselves to the study of
modern methods of bibliographic classification, specially with refer
ence to sociology, and their work has been supported by the Belgian
Government.       They were led to adopt the decimal system devised by
Melvil Dewey, which is popular with American librarians, and
having made a careful study of its application, have become so
impressed with its value that they have developed an extraordinarily
comprehensive scheme applicable to literature generally.
   An invitation to attend a conference in Brussels at the beginning of
September last was received by the Royal Society early in Angust,
too late unfortunately to permit of a representative being present.
   At the conference held there on the 2nd to 4th of September, a
number of resolutions to establish an International            Institute of
Bibliography as a development of the work begun by the above-
mentioned gentlemen, were arrived at, and by a Royal Decree of
 September 12, 1895, such an office was established.
   Your senior secretary had an opportunity, when in Brussels
recently, of visiting the office which has been established, and of
seeing the skill and zeal with which the preliminary preparations
have been made to cany the work into execution.
   All must admire the energy and enterprise which has thus been
displayed in Belgium.         At the same time the magnitude of the work
and the importance          of   the interests involved are such that it
appears most desirable that the action which the Royal Society has
already taken for an International Conference should be perse
vered in, so that decisions may be arrived at which may ensure, if
possible, complete success.         The enterprise is one in which we, in
consequence    of  our   long  connection  with such work, are most deeply
interested ; it is also one which may well become of exceeding value
to science generally.       But it is impossible to overrate the difficulties
 connected   with   it ;  and   to avoid unnecessary complications in the
future it is essential that very many questions — especially the division
 of the subject matter in the various branches of science and the
nomenclature to be used — be taken into consideration by competent
bodies and settled by general agreement.
                                          I
   In my last Anniversary Address mentioned that the Library Com
mittee, in view of the great accumulation of the stock of Philo
                                                                     '
 sophical Transactions,' were taking measures to make the memoirs
 composing the volumes separately available to the public, which,
 while facilitating the sale, would increase their utility.     I have now
 the pleasure   to  announce      that arrangements  have  been  made   with
 Messrs. Dulau and Co. to carry out this suggestion, and that Messrs.

  Dalau have, at their own expense, issued a very useful alphabetical
  list of all the papers in the ' Philosophical Transactions,' from the
  year 1800 to the present time, any of which may now be separately
/ purchased by the public.
     The great and increasing success of our annual soirees has led the
  House and Soiree Committee to recommend to the Council that in ad
  dition to the two conversaziones held in May and June, some informal
  receptions for the Fellows should also be occasionally held. This
  suggestion was readily adopted by the Council, and the first of these
  receptions was held last month.
     The Water Research Committee have continued the labours which
  they commenced in conjunction with the London County Council
  four years ago, and although the County Council no longer con
  tributes to the expenses, the Committee have been able to carry on
  the researches, partly by means of an assignment from the Govern
  ment Grant, and partly by a grant from the fund established in 18^1,
  by his Excellency Dr. Gunning. A Report, of 200 pages, by Prof.
  Marshall Ward, forming the Fourth Report to the Committee, was
  presented to the Council of the Royal Society last March, and has
  been published in the ' Proceedings.'         This Report treats of the
  biology of Bacillus raviosus (Fraenkel), a schizomycete of the River
  Thames.
     With respect to the Gunning Fund which          I have just now men
  tioned, the Committee appointed by the Council to consider and
  report upon the best terms for carrying out the trust, made the
  following recommendations, which, with Dr. Gnnning's approval,
  were adopted by the Council : —
             " 1. That the Fund should not be applied in the form of a
          prize, medal, or reward, but should be devoted to the further
          ance of knowledge in some special direction.
             " 2. That,
                        by preference, the interest accruing from the Fund
          during every three years be applied for the promotion of
          Physical Science and of Biology alternately.
             " 3. That aid should,
                                   by preference, thus be given in Physical
          Science and Biology respectively, either to investigations or
          operations which    require to be repeated from time to time,
          or to the development of some specified         continued line of
          research."
     The Council, while adhering to the policy of retrenchment touched
  upon in my last address, have had to recognise the fact that the
  Society was, at that time, already committed to a large amount of
  publication, a great bulk of printed matter being almost ready for
  issue.   This accumulation has been rapidly worked off during the
  past session, with the result that the Council, notwithstanding that

have issued in the mathematical and physical section of the ' Philo

sophical Transactions no less than 31 papers, and in the biological
section 21. The two sections together contain in all 2259 pages of
letterpress and 61 plates.      Of the ' Proceedings,' 14 numbers have
been issued, containing 1356 pages.
    While determined not to depart from the policy of avoiding all
-unnecessary expenditure on publication, the Council felt that with
only   the funds hitherto at its disposal  it could not effect the requisite
diminution of expenditure without diminishing the efficiency of the
Royal Society in promoting the augmentation of natural knowledge,
-which is the reason for its existence. An application to the Treasury
for additional funds was therefore made by a resolution of Council
adopted at its meeting of the 20th of June last. 1 am happy to say
that a favourable answer has been received, and a grant of £1,000
a year has been given by the Treasury to the Royal Society for the
purpose of aidiEg in the adequate publication of scientific matter,
whether in the 'Transactions' or 'Proceedings' of the Society or
through other channels and in other ways.
   At a meeting of the Council on the 17th of October it was resolved
to send to the Institute of France the following address on the
occasion of the centenary of its foundation ; and it was agreed to
authorise the President and Treasurer to represent the Royal
Society at the commemoration to be held in Paris from the 23rd to
the 26th of October :—
   "The President and Coancil of the Royal Society of London offer
to the Institut de France their most cordial congratulations on the
auspicious occasion of the centenary of its existence, which it is now
about to celebrate.
   " The President and Council are well aware that various ancient
Academies flourished in France long before the official foundation of
the Institut as a means of recording discoveries and promoting arts
and sciences, and that much of that great advance in human know
ledge which took place during the 17th and 18th centuries was due
to the labours of members of the French Academy of Science.
   " The foundation of the Institut,
                                          however, comprising as it does
five Academies, each with its own special sphere of action, but all
united as one harmonious whole, constantly investigating the laws of
nature and the developments of art, constitutes an era in the history
of civilisation.
   " It would be an endless task to
                                              attempt to enumerate the
branches of human knowledge which during the past century have
benefited by the labours of the Institut.       It is a body of which not
only France but the whole of the civilised world may be justly
proud.

     "  It is sad to think, that just at the moment of a commemoration
which would otherwise have been celebrated with unalloyed pleasure,
Science has to mourn the loss of one of her most distinguished
votaries. The single-minded and devoted labours of Pasteur, and
their beneficial results to man and the domestic animals, are recog

     I had the honour of presenting this address to the President of the
Institute of Prance in person. For myself and other Fellows of the
Royal Society who were present along with me I may be allowed to
say that we were much gratified with the friendly and fraternal
reception accorded to us, as colleagues and fellow labourers in the
work of the Institute.
      I am sorry to say that we are now losing the service, as Assistant-
Secretary, of Mr. Herbert Rix, who, after seventeen years of faithful
work for the Royal Society, retires from this post, as he finds the
necessarily increased anxiety and burden of the office to be too great
a strain upon his health.       We all feel grateful to him for the manner
in which he has discharged his duties from the time he first entered
                                              I

rally will agree with the Council in being pleased that we have been
 able to arrange to still have Mr. Rix to help us in our work, in the
 less arduous post of Secretary to the Government Grant Committee.
     A very important scientific event of the past year, resulting from
 work initiated by the Royal Society a quarter of a century ago, is
 the completion of the ' Report of the " Challenger " Expedition,' in fifty
large royal quarto volumes containing 29,500 pages, and illustrated
 by over 3,000 lithographic plates, copper-plates, charts, maps, and
                 I                                 "             " was fitted

 out by the Government in 1872, on the recommendation of the Royal
 Society, and was absent for nearly four years on an exploration of
 the Great Ocean Basins.         The publication of the numerous observa
  tions, which have enriched almost every branch of science, was at
  first carried on under the direction of Sir C. Wyville Thomson, and
 subsequently by Mr. John Murray.
      I  have been myself much struck with the extreme beauty of many

the subject,    I may be allowed to say that        I believe nothing more
admirable has been hitherto given to the world in the way of illustra
tion and representation of biological subjects. Of the maps,            I  may
confidently say     that   they   are  models   of   careful, accurate,     and
elaborate work.       Two volumes of the Report deal with the narrative
of the voyage, three volumes with the physics and chemistry of the
ocean, one volume with deep-sea deposits and geology, two volumes
with botany, forty volumes with marine zoology, and two volumes
are devoted to a summary of the scientific results.
    How highly the work of the "Challenger" expedition is appreci
ated by those best qualified to judge of the merits of its results is
illustrated by the following words, spoken by Milne-Edwards at a
meeting of the International Congress of Zoology, held last Septem
ber in Leiden : — " L'expedition du ' Challenger ' a porte des fruits
 merveilleux.     Cenx qui l'ont organise, ceux qui y ont pris part, et
 dont quelques-uns ne sont plus ici pour recueillir le prix de leurs
 efforts, ceux qui en ont etudie les resultats, ont rendu des services
 dont nous leur sommes profondement reconnaissants. Le monument
 scientifique ainsi eleve par les savants anglais constitue un titre de
 gloire dont une nation a le droit d'etre fiere."
    The contributors to this gigantic Report are, for the most part,
natives of the United Kingdom and the British Colonies, but the
 scientific men of nearly every civilised State are represented among
 thcauthors. The British and foreign contributors are seventy-six
 in number, and many scientific men whose names do not appear on
 the title pages of the special memoirs have taken part in the physical
 and chemical researches performed in connection with the work of
 the expedition.      Among the contributors we find the names of
 Alexander Agassiz, Ernst Haeckel, P. Gr. Tait, G. 0. Sars, F. E.
 Schulze, T. H. Huxley, Rudolph Bergh, A. v. Kolliker, A. Renard,
 W. K. Brooks, N. N. Polejaeff, Th. Studer, A. A. W. Hubrecht, W.

 present meeting      I  shall  have  the pleasure of presenting to Mr.
 Murray one of the Royal medals, which has been awarded to him by
 the Council of the Royal Society to mark their appreciation of his
 editorship of this great work and of his own scientific contributions
 to  it.
    In                                           I
         my Presidential Address of last year took occasion to refer to
 Lord Rayleigh's discovery that the gas which remains when oxygen,
 vapour of water, and carbonic acid are removed from common air is
 denser than nitrogen extracted from chemical compounds; and was         I
  then able to tell you of the consequent discovery that our atmosphere
 contains a fifth constituent which is denser than nitrogen.               This
  discovery had been thoroughly established by Rayleigh, in association

118                      Anniversary Meeting.                 [Nov.   '6C
with Ramsay, who had joined him in the work ; but no details had!
then been published.  They had succeeded in isolating the new con
stituent by extracting all the four previously known constituents
  (oxygen, nitrogen, aqueous vapour, carbonic acid) from air, and they
 were energetically at work with a view to discovering its properties.
I   concluded my last year's address by expressing the hope that their
 work would give us, " before the next anniversary meeting of the
 Royal Society, much knowledge of the properties, both physical and
 chemical, of the hitherto unknown and still anonymous fifth constituent
 of our atmosphere." That hope, as you all know, has been splendidly
 fulfilled.  They early discovered a name for it, Argon, because exhaus
 tive chemical investigation gave them no evidence of its chemical
 combination with any other known element. They found its density
 to be very high, 20 (that of oxygen being called 16), and the ratio of
 its specific heats If. Olszewski, experimenting on a specimen sent
 to him by Ramsay, succeeded in liquefying      it, and found its critical
pressure to be 506 atmospheres and its critical temperature — 121°.
These results were communicated in a joint paper by Rayleigh
and Ramsay to the Royal Society at a memorable meeting, held
 (January 31) in the theatre of the University of London, because our
 ordinary meeting room was not large enough to contain all who
wished to hear it. It will be gratifying to Fellows of the Royal
 Society to know that the Smithsonian Institution of Washington
gave to Lord Rayleigh and Professor William Ramsay the first
Hodgkins' prize for their Memoir on Argon a new constituent of
                           '
                                                :
the Atmosphere.'      This memoir had been communicated to Wash
ington before the end of December, 1894.
    Since the dates of those first communications much work has been
done by various observers on the spectrum analysis of argon.         In a
communication by Rayleigh to the recent meeting of the British
Association, we find a very accurate determination of its refractive
index and its viscosity.     Ramsay, in trying for clues to compounds
of argon, had his attention called by Mr. Miers of the British Museum
to a paper by Hillebrande, telling that cleveite      (a rare Norwegian
mineral which consists chiefly of uranate of lead) gives out     2     per
cent, of a gas, supposed to be nitrogen, when warmed with weak
sulphuric acid. Ramsay, thinking the so-called nitrogen might turn
out to be argon, experimented on the mineral. He found that the
gas evolved, by heating it in sulphuric acid, contained a trace of
nitrogen, which he removed by the Cavendish process of sparking
with oxygen in presence of alkaline liquor. The residue was proved
by the spectrum test to contain argon, but to contain also another
gas, not argon, showing itself by a brilliant yellow line.     This line
was identified by Crookes as the      " helium line," discovered thirty
years ago by Lockyer,     who, finding
                                     it  to have been not discovered in

\ 1895.]                          Presidents Address.                         119
  the spectrum of any terrestrial substance spectroscopically examined
  up to that time, attributed it to a substance in the sun's atmosphere,
  which he called helium.               Thus, a substance, discovered thirty
  years ago in the sun's atmosphere, and accordingly named from the
  sun, has been found in a terrestrial mineral by Ramsay, in his quest
  after argon. Having got helium into his laboratory, he found its
  density to be less than 3'9 (ultimately reduced to 2), and, therefore,
  less than one-fifth (about one-tenth) of that of argon. He sent a
  specimen to Olszewski, who found* that the treatment by which he
  had succeeded in liquefying hydrogen — namely, compressing with a
  pressure of 140 atmospheres, cooling to the temperature of liquid
  siir boiling at low pressure, and then expanding suddenly, showed
  no signs of liquefying helium.
      Considering       the uncertainty as to the density of the gas in
  which helium was identified and the multiplicity of spectra found
  for it by various experimenters, Lockyer, who experimented on some
  eighty minerals and found the yellow line of helium in sixteen of
  them, thinks it most probable that it is not a single gas that is
  extracted either from cleveite or the other minerals, but a mixture of
  gases of which helium is one ; and this view was supported by Runge
  and Paschen in their admirable spectroscopic analysis of argon and
  helium, communicated to the British Assoeiationt at its recent meet
  ing at Ipswich. It seems too early to feel sure that the helium
  found by Ramsay in the gas from cleveite, if perfectly purified of
  nitrogen and other known gases, is a single gas, or is a mixture or
  combination of several.           Before another anniversary meeting of the
  Royal Society,      it is probable that we shall have certain knowledge,
  without any doubt as to this question. Meantime, at our present
  anniversary, we may be satisfied to feel that if there are several new
  gases, of which one, at least, has density less than a quarter of that of
  oxygen, the discovery will be several times as interesting as if the
  helium now discovered proves to be only one gas.

         of it is his creation. The extensions which he has made to

         the advances made by him in the theory of Abelian trans

         further developments. Also the valuable advances made by

of proof which he has introduced in his investigations ; he has
associated a vigour and a strictness with the minutest details of his
proofs that have not merely led to the sound establishment of pro
positions, but have indicated limitations and have suggested new ideas.

energetic and successful editorship of the Report of the " Challenger

the deep sea deposits, and his general discussion of the oceanographic
results of the expedition, are recognised as being of first-rate quality.

                              Royal Medal.
                 Professor James Alfred Ewing,     F.R.S.
   A Royal   Medal is conferred on Professor   J.  A. Ewing for his in
vestigations on Magnetic Induction in Iron and other Metals.
   The magnetic properties of iron and steel when subjected to mag
netising forces of different intensities, under various conditions of
temperature and mechanical stress, have been studied by many
physicists both in this country and abroad.         In a series of papers
which have appeared at intervals during the last fourteen years,
Professor Ewing has put on record a remarkable collection of experi
mental facts connected with these complicated subjects. In some of
his results and methods he was anticipated by others, but apart from
the wide extent of his investigations, he has displayed great sagacity
and originality both in his more fundamental researches, and in the
directions in which he has developed his work.
    Having studied the behaviour of iron when subject to magnetic
forces which vary in a cycle, he applied the same process to nickel,
proving that, as in the case of iron, the susceptibility is constant for
small forces, but that the range of force over which this law holds
good is much larger for nickel than for iron.
   Professor Ewing has also investigated the behaviour of iron and
steel of various qualities, of manganese steel, of cobalt and nickel,
when placed in very strong magnetic fields, the intensity of which
was raised to the splendid magnitude of 25,000 C.G.S. units in the
air around the metal bar under observation, thereby producing an
" indnction " of over 45,000 within the bar, when the bar was iron.
He showed experimentally, in corroboration and extension of Joule's
primary discovery for iron, that in iron, nickel, and cobalt, the
intensity of magnetisation approaches asymptotically towards a
limiting value, which it very nearly reaches before the magnetising
force attains a comparatively small magnitude, and at which it
remains constant while the magnetising force is increased without
limit.
   Not content with investigations     such as these, Professor Ewing
has made an important advance in our knowledge of the probable
constitution of magnetic substances.        He constructed a model of
such bodies by placing a number of small magnets near to each
other so that each is free to rotate in a horizontal plane.         These
magnets,   when  disturbed,  settled down  into   groups  of more  or less
utable equilibrium, which are gradually broken up under the in
fluence of increasing magnetic forces.        This model suggests the
novel and most important conclusion that the act of magnetisation
is accompanied by the re-arrangement of similar groups of magnetic
molecules.    So closely does it reproduce the behaviour of iron, that

 it is possible not only to imitate the more prominent phenomena, to
 copy the curve of magnetisation, and the loops produced by cyclic
 forces, but also to detect minor details which were for long over
 looked in iron itself.
    Throughout these theoretical researches Professor Ewing has paid
 attention to their practical applications.   The well-known pheno
  menon which he has named " hysteresis " plays an important part
 in the action of transformers.     He has, on this account, invented
 two instruments by which the magnetic properties of samples of
 iron can be readily tested.
    Professor Ewing's researches on Magnetic Induction are described
 in a series of memoirs published in the ' Transactions ' of the Royal
 Society, and in a number of shorter papers which appeared chiefly
 in the ' Roy. Soc. Proc.' and the ' Reports of the British Associa
 tion.' He ranks as one of the principal authorities on a subject of
 great theoretical and practical importance.     He has thrown light
 upon the theory, and has facilitated its application to industry.
                              Davy Medal.
                    Professor William liamsay, F.B.S.
    Professor Ramsay's earlier researches were in the department of
organic chemistry.      Nearly twenty years ago he was carrying on
researches on Picoline and its Derivatives, which were published in
the ' Phil. Mag.' for 1887 and 1888, and on Quinine and its Decom
position Products, the results of which were published in the 'Chem.
Soc. Trans.' for 1878 and 1879.
    Professor Ramsay's later researches have been more devoted to
subjects in the borderland dividing chemistry and physics.     In 1879
and 1881, he published in the 'Chem. Soc. Trans.' four papers on
Molecular Volumes, and between the years 1880 and 1892 he com
municated to the Royal Society eight papers on the Critical State
and Properties of Liquids, two being published in the ' Proceedings,'
and six in the ' Phil. Trans.' In 1893 he published the results of
researches    on Molecular Surface Energy in the ' Phil. Mag.,' the
' Chem. Soc. Trans.,' and the ' Proc. Roy. Soc.' In 1893, he com
municated to the ' Phil. Mag.' a very important paper on the Expan
sion of Rarefied Gases.
    But the researches on which the award of the Davy Medal to Pro
fessor Ramsay is chiefly founded are, firstly, those which he has
carried on, in conjunction with Lord Rayleigh, in the investigation of
the properties of argon, and in the discovery of improved and rapid
methods of getting it from the atmosphere ; and, secondly, his dis
covery in certain rare minerals of a new elementary gas which
appears to be identical with the hitherto hypothetical solar element,

 to which    Mr. Lockyer many years ago gave the name of " helium."
 The spectrum of this terrestrial gas was seen at first as an extremely
 narrow and sharp line of a brilliant yellow colour, close to, and
 slightly more refrangible than the sodium lines, Di and Di, and
having a wave-length near to 5876, this, according to recent de
terminations, being the wave-length of the solar line of helium, or,
as it is usually designated, D3.      Shortly after its discovery, Professor
Range, of Hanover, announced that the yellow line of Ramsay's gas
was double, consisting of a strong component having a wave-length
of 5875.88, and a faint component having a wave-length of 5876"21.
As no observer had seen the solar line D3 double, doubt was thrown
on the first assumption that Professor Ramsay had actually isolated
a solar element hitherto unknown            on the earth.     A few weeks
later, however, Dr. Huggins, in England, and Professor Hale, in
America, have detected the presence of a faint luminous companion
of D3 in the spectrum of the chromosphere, and as these solar lines
have the same wave-lengths as those of the corresponding terrestrial
 lines, the doubts at first raised have been set at rest.          The body
 giving   rise to the solar line D3, and  Professor Ramsay's   new  gas from
 cleveite, uraninite, broggerite, monazite, and many other rare
 minerals, is now admitted by chemists, physicists, and astronomers
 to be the same substance — helium.
    The conferring of the Davy Medal on Professor Ramsay is a crown
 ing act of recognition of his work on argon and helium, which has
 already been recognised as worthy of honour by scientific societies in
 other countries.     For his discoveries on these gases he has already
 been awarded the Foreign Membership of the Societé Philosophique
 de Geneve, and of the Leyden Philosophical Society.            He has had
 the Barnard Medal of the Columbia College awarded to him by the
 American Academy of Sciences, and within the last few weeks he
 has been elected a Foreign Correspondent of the French Academie
  des Sciences.
    Five years have now passed since you elected me to be your
  President.    Living at a distance of 400 miles from London, I felt
  that it could not be possible for me to accept the honour when the
 possibility of its being offered to me was first suggested.     I  accepted,
 with much misgiving as to my ability to perform the duty which
  would fall upon me ; and now, after having been re-elected four
 times, I feel that if the interests of the Society have not suffered
 under my presidency, it is chiefly because they have been so
 faithfully and unintermittently cared for and worked for by the other
 officers, the Treasurer and the Secretaries, who have left nothing
  nndoue that could be done to promote the welfare of the Royal
  Society. For their unfailing kindness to myself       I  can only offer my

124                          Anniversary Meeting.                [Nov. 30T
heartfelt thanks.       I  soon found that what   I looted forward to witH

apprehension the Council meetings, and as many of the ordinary
                I
meetings as could attend, during my University session in Glasgow
— were the reverse of fatigning ; and        I am only sorry that   I have
been so many times obliged to forego the pleasure of performing that
part of my presidential duty.        I look back otherwise with unmixed
pleasure to all the meetings at which I have presided, and my sole
                     I
regret now is — cannot disguise it, and it is a very keen regret —
that these five years are passed, and that to-day I cease to be your
President.      I thank you all, my colleagues of the Royal Society, for
electing    me  five times to be your President, for forgiving me all my
short-comings, and for the inestimable benefit which you have
conferred on me by giving me your friendship.

                                      Philosophical Transactions (Series B,
1894),   the   comparative study      of  the spore-bearing members of the
Lycopodineae, including the Psilotacew, has led to the conclusion that
there is reasonable probability that septation of sporangia originally
simple, to form synangia, has taken place ; that a septate body
(synangium) may be homologous with a non-septate body (simple
sporangium) ; and that there is no essential difference between tissue
which will form septa or trabeculae, and that which will form spores,
since the tissues can mutually undergo conversion one into the other.
   But the considerations there brought forward do not amount to an
actual demonstration that septation has occurred. For the purpose
of our discussion, it is important to ascertain whether such demon
stration can be given in the case of parts which are undoubtedly
homologous ; it is afforded by the study of septate anthers, which
occur in several distinct families of Angiosperms, e.g., Mimoseae,
Onagraceae,      Loranthaceae,     Myrsineae, Rhizophoreae,       Orchidaceae,
Rafflesiaceae.    Taking the case of       the Onagraceae,  the  common type

of the anther is the ordinary quadrilocular type, but in certain genera
transverse septa are formed in each of the four pollen-sacs by conver
sion of certain cells of the potential archesporinm into sterile tissue ;
the unavoidable conclusion already drawn by other writers for this
and other cases, is that these septate anthers are derived from those
of the ordinary quadrilocular type, and the process of septation thus
illustrated is essentially similar to that described for the Lycopodineas
in my previous paper. We thus see that septation of sporangia has
actually occurred, and that it is a rather wide- spread phenomenon in
Angiosperms.     It will therefore be merely a question of probability
whether, and how far, it has also occurred in lower forms, and whether
it is by septation that those synangia were produced, which are so
marked a feature in certain Pteridophyta.
    The argument from developmental evidence             is comparatively
simple where, as in the Angiosperms, the meristems are distinctly
stratified, and the archesporinm is a deSnite layer, ultimately hypo-
dermal in origin ; but in applying a similar argument to the
Pteridophyta, in which the meristems are not clearly stratified, it is
less easy to arrive at a conclusion.     The principle is to be laid down
that the study of the sporangia or synangia of a plant is to be carried
out in the light of a knowledge of the segmentation of its apical meristems.
The sporangia are parts of the plant-body, and their segmentations
do not differ essentially from those of the meristems of the other
parts of the plants on which they occur. Where the meristems are
stratified, as in Angiosperms, a clearly stratified structure of the
sporangia is commonly found ; where, as in the Pteridophyta, the
meristems are not stratified, it would be plainly unreasonable to
expect a stratified structure of the sporangia, and such structure is
not found. Accordingly, in using developmental evidence in solving
 the question whether synangia in Pteridophytes resulted from septa
 tion, the existence of a continuous hypodermal archesporinm cannot
 reasonably be demanded as evidence of septation, though of course it
 may occur, as indeed it does in Isoetes ; it is, however, to be remem
 bered that in this plant the meristems are more clearly stratified than
 in most Pteridophyta.
    The considerations thus briefly epitomised are a necessary prelude
  to the comparative study of the Ophioglossaceae.      In my preliminary
 statement (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 50, p. 265)   I have described, chiefly
 from examination of Ophioglossum pendulum, a continuous hypodermal
  band as the potential archesporinm, which subsequently was differ
  entiated into sporogenous groups and septa ; such a band appears
  with some degree of regularity in this species, but it is not constant,
  and is not found with any clearly defined outer limit in 0. vulgatum
                            I
  or reticulatum; thus far admit the validity of Rostowzew's criticism
 of my preliminary statement (" Beitr. z. Kenntniss der Ophioglosseen.

 1895.]           Morphology   of Spore-producing Members.            139
 1.  Oph. vulgatum., L.," Moscow, 1892).          On looking more care
                                       I
fully into this question, however, have found that a band of super
 ficial cells, differing in origin and segmentation from the surrounding
 cells, may be recognised as the sporangiogenic band ; this gives rise
 to the sterile septa, the sporogenous groups, and the external wall of
 the sporangia ; the band usually consists of two longitudinal rows of
 cells, possibly referable in origin to a single row, but there is some
 variety of detail. The observations have been made on three species,
 viz., 0. vulgatum, L., 0. reticulatum, L., and 0. pendulum, L.
    The band, at first undifferentiated, subsequently forms (i) arche-
 sporia at intervals, (ii) sterile septa which intervene between them,
 and (iii) the outer sporangial walls. The cell-groups which give rise
to septa and to archesporin are sister cell-groups, having a common
origin, and no difference can be seen between them in early stages ;
the distinction only becomes apparent as the archesporia attain their
characteristic denser contents, and the difference is thus functional,
 not genetic. The archesporium of the single sporangium has not
 been found to be referable in origin to a single cell, and it is not
 defined by the first periclinal wall of the cells of the sporangiogenic
 band.    These facts aro all compatible with a theory of the origin of
the spike of Ophioglossum by septation from a simple sporangium of
the Lycopodinous type, and the sporangiogenic band may be compared
with the band of cells, sometimes a single row, or two or three,
 which, after periclinal division, give rise to the archesporium of
 Lycopodium.
    The development of the sporangia of Botrychium and Helmintho-
itachys has also been traced, but these facts do not bear so directly
upon the question of the nature and origin of the Ophioglossaceous
spike as those derived from the study of Ophioglossum.
    Abnormalities have played a large part in former discussions upon
the morphology of the spike in the Ophioglossaceae.        While recognis
ing the obvious con-elation which exists between vegetative develop
ment and spore-production, it has been concluded that the abnor
malities in this family do not form a sufficient basis for argument,
certainly not when the conclusions drawn from them are in opposi
tion to the results of comparison of normal specimens.         Such com -
parison led Mettenius, Strasburger,          Celakovsky, and others to
recognise a relationship       of  the Opbioglossaceae  to the Lycopod.*.
This comparison has been developed at considerable length, on
grounds not only of the similarity of the development and position
of their spore-bearing members, but also by comparison of the
synangia of the Psilotaceae ; the Gametophyte, also, and sexual
organs and embryology, as far as known, have been taken into
account, and a detailed comparison made of certain features in the
anatomy of the Lycopods and Ophioglossaceae.           From these various

sources a general support of the    relationship has been traced, the
nearest point of comparison appearing to be between 0. Bergianum
and Phylloglossum Drummondii ; it is contended that this is not a case
of mere mimicry, but of real relationship, though such relationship
probably dates from a remote and unknown ancestry.
   Such a relationship would involve the idea of septation of the
simpler type of Lycopodiuous sporangium, to form the spike of
 Ophioglossum, but it has been shown that septation of a very similar
nature has occurred in the anthers of certain Angiosperms, and that
the developmental details of Ophioglossum are compatible with such
a view.     The conclusion of Celakovsky is, therefore, regarded as
                     "
probably true, viz., that both the Lycopodiaceffi and Ophioglossacew
sprang from a common stock, which had the simple sporophylls of
the Lycopodiaeeae.    The Lycopods are probably, of living plants, the
nearest prototypes of the Ophioglossacesa."     Thus, the view put for
ward is not new nor original, but, being now based on a wider area
of fact, may take rank as a reasonably probable theory.
   A comparison of the Ophioglossaceae among themselves shows that
probably the genus Ophioglossum forms a series of increasing com
plexity, extending from such types as 0. Bergianum or lutitanicum
to such forms as 0. pendulum and pal/matum.       Comparison of a large
number of specimens of the latter species shows that the many-
spiked condition is led up to by specimens with one, two, or three
spikes, which are matched by abnormal specimens of 0. vulgatum.
The view is put forward that the many-spiked condition occasion
ally met with in other species has become the typical state in O.
palmatum, and that it has been brought about by a chorisis or
interpolation similar to that of the stamens of certain Angiosperms.
It is further to be added that the insertion of the spikes is com
monly on the adaxial surface of the frond, rarely upon the margin ;
the facts accordingly do not support the hypothesis that the many
spikes are of the nature of pinnae : thus, in Ophioglossum the pro
gression appears to be towards multiplication of sporangia and
formation of a plurality of spikes.
   In Botrychium the progression appears to be from types such as
B. simplex, in which there is close similarity to a simple Ophio
glossum, by branching of the spike which is closely connected with
enlargement and septation of the sporangia, to the condition seen
in such species as B. virginianum, the branching of the spike running
 parallel with that of the subtending frond.         The formation of
sporangia abnormally on the latter, a condition commonly seen in
B. Lunaria, but rare in most other species, is believed to be an
example of reversion of a part typically vegetative to the sporo-
genous condition, and not indicative of a common character of the
spike and the vegetative frond.     Finally, Helminthostachys occupies

an interesting intermediate position ; the replacement of the sunken
sporangia of Ophioglossum by projecting sporangiophores in Helmin-
thostachys suggests, as already indicated in the preliminary statement
('Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 50, p. 265), an interesting analogy with the
hypothetical origin of the strobilus of Equisetum from a body of the
nature of a sporogonial head.
   The chief object in view in these investigations has not been the
mere tracing of homologies of parts among living forms ; but, by
developmental study and comparison, the following out of the prob
able methods of progression in the evolution of the more complex
from the simpler types.      It is believed that all the three methods of
increase in number of separate sporangia, suggested in the former
memoir (' Phil. Trans.,' 1894, vol. B, p. 473), have been employed,
viz. (i) septation, (ii) branching or chorisis, (iii) a reversion of vege
tative parts to the sporogenous condition. In addition to these,
however, there has probably occurred also an eruption of appendicular
organs from a previously smooth surface. This has already been
suggested elsewhere       ('Annals of Botany,' vol. 8, p. 343) ; the
sporangiophores     of Helminthostachys   may be taken as an interesting
example of such eruption.       It will be thus seen that the memoir, of
which this is a very brief abstract, touches some of the most funda
mental conceptions of the morphology of vascular plants, approaching
them, not from the point of view derived from comparison of higher
 forms, but from the study and comparison of organisms which are
believed to be nearer to the border line between Bryophyta and
Vascular plants, viz., the Homosporoiis Pteridophyta.
  II. "   Preliminary Statement on the Sorus of Daticea."              By
       F. 0. Bower, F.R.S., Regius Professor         of  Botany, Univer
       sity of Glasgow.      Received    November    29,  1895.
    The sorus of Dancea, though its structure in the mature state has
 been   repeatedly described, has not yet been studied as regards its
development.
   The oblong, cake-like sori lie parallel to one another on the lower
surface of the leaf, their longer axes following the course of the
vascular bundles. Each sorus consists of two rows of loculi, of
approximately equal size, completely sunk in the rather massive
tissne of the wall. Dehiscence is described as being by a pore at the
apex of each loculus.
    The sporogenous tissue of each loculus is usually referable to the
segmentation of a single superficial cell, which gives rise to it,
 and to the portion of the sporangial wall above it. There is, how
 ever, great variety of bulk, number of cells, and mode of segmentation

142         Preliminary Statement on tlie Sorus o/Danaea.        [Dec. 5,
in adjoining sporangia; though the sporangia of the same sorus
develop    simultaneously, such extreme differences of number as
between 4 and 16 cells may be seen in the same section.            More
over, the whole sporogenous group is not always referable to a
single parent cell. These facts stand in marked contrast to the
uniformity of size and segmentation so characteristic of the Lepto-
sporangiate Ferns.
    The dehiscence is by slits, which appear in the sporangial wall
above the loculus.     By the drying and contraction of the adjoining
cells the slit gapes widely, and appears as a pore ; but the details
are very like those of other Marattiaceae, excepting that there is no
" annnlus " of indurated cells. This, which is absent in Danma,
where the loculi are deeply sunk, is present in those Marattiaceas
in which the sporangia project as separate papillae.       In the latter
case theannulus is mechanically effective in widening the slit; in the
former, the sporangia being closely united, such mechanical effect
 would be impossible.
    Though the loculi of a sorus are frequently of nearly uniform size,
examples may often be found where they vary to an extreme degree ;
and these have an important bearing upon the theory of septation ;
for cases of incomplete septation are often to be recognised in the
mature sorus, while the study of earlier stages has revealed almost all
imaginable steps between the single loculus and two loculi lying side
by side as an obvious pair.    Such pairs of loculi are common ; some
 times the septum between them is of the average thickness ; some
 times thin, but still complete,     with firm, permanent tissue con
 tinuous across it ; sometimes the permanent tissue is incomplete, and
 the septum composed in its middle part only of tapetum, which dis
 appears at maturity ; sometimes a large loculus will be seen with only
 alight encroachments of tapetum upon the sporogenous group, thus
 indicating the position, though not realising the complete develop
 ment of a possible septum ; the last step of the series would be simply
 a loculus larger than the average, and these are common.
    An analytical study of the tissues shows that the tissue of these
 partial septa may have either of two sources of origin : (1) single
 cells of the sporogenous group are liable to development as sterile
 cells; this has been seen in sporangia which even approach the
 normal ; (2) the surrounding tissue may encroach on the sporogenous
 «roup, in the form of tapetal cells, which, when their development is
 considerable, is followed by cells of permanent tissue of the wall ; in
 these cases the partial septa will be clearly seen in the mature state.
    The similarity between these results and what is known in the
 ease of septate anthers of Adgiosperms is of peculiar interest ; in these
 ;inthers partial septa are common, and a detailed comparison of them
 with those of Damea suggests that the phenomena are closely alike.

1895.]         On the Weight      of a Cubic Decimetre of Water.                   143
But, in the case of the Angiospermic anthers, we conclude, on com
parative grounds, that progressive septation has taken place ; this
would indirectly support the view that the sorus of Daneea is also a
result of progressive septation.
    Obviously such a series of stages as that presented by Daneea may
be read either way, and it would be possible to urge that in them we
have evidence, not of progressive septation, but of fnsion of loculi.
This question must be considered on grounds of general probability.
Without at the moment declaring a final opinion (though think the         I
probability is largely in favour of a view of progressive septation),
this point, at least, seems clear: that in Daneea the identity of the
sporangium or loculus is not strictly defined. To arrive at this point is,
in my opinion, a matter of some importance ; the study of the
sporangium in Pteridophyta has long been based upon the examina
tion of the highly specialised and strictly constructed sporangium of
the Leptosporangiatae. The conclusion is, however, becoming obvious
 that such strictness of construction and regularity of segmentation is
 exceptional, and that in the Eusporangiatae such strictness is not the
 rule.
    Other Marattiaceae,         and especially Kaulfuisia, have also been
 examined, and they are all found to conform to one fundamental
type, though differing in detail ; it appears that, as regards the sorus,
Danaa is the least specialised, and Angiopteris the most specialised, of
the living genera, and that they form a very natural series.                    Such a
series in plants of so antique a stock deserves the most careful com
parative study, and the results should carry unusual weight.

the year 1798,* after allowing for the new measures made by Captain
 Kater,f as well as for all corrections according to our present know
ledge of the weight of a litre of air and on the expansion of water,
give the result that the weight of a cubic decimetre of water at its
maximum density (4° C.) in vacuo is equal to 1000-56 grams.                    J   But

   +0'27 gram, and as the water used was not sufficiently pure (having
   a density of about 1*0005), the above-named result is to be considered
  as of small accuracy and doubtless much in excess of its real weight.
  Nevertheless, from these determinations, assuming the density of the
  water used by Shuckburgh* to be as above mentioned, one may con
  clude that the probable weight is 1000-06+0'14 grams, which comes
 very near to the real weight of the cubic decimetre, the small differ
 ence arising in all probability from the insufficient accuracy of the
 temperature measurements near 62° F., at which the weighings were
 made.
     It is well known that at the institution of the metrical system
 at the end of the eighteenth century, the weight of the kilogram was
 declared to be equal in vacuo to the weight of a cubic decimetre of
 water at its maximum density. For this purpose M. Lefevre-Gineau
 made an exhaustive investigation, upon which M. Tralles made a
report on the 31st May, 1779 (h 11 prairial, an 7), first published in
 '
    Base du Systeme Métrique,' Tom.                Ill, pp. 558 — 580, in the year
 1810 ; the original observations of Lefevre-Gineau                     are, however,
still unknown.           From the data given in Mr. Tralles' report M.
Broch found in 1873t, after making the necessary corrections, that
the probable weight deducible from the data of the experiments lies
between the limits from 999-913 to 999947 + 0020 grams.                        I have
myself made a new reduction^ of the data given by Tralles and Gineau,
the result being 999-966 + 0'03 grams. But to this result also we
cannot attribute any particular importance, principally for the three
following reasons : — 1. The original observations of Lefevre-Gineau
are unknown.         2. The cylinder employed by Lefevre-Gineau                in the
numerous (altogether forty-eight) weighings at +0°'3 C. had a
special small tube providing a communication between the inner
part of the cylinder and the outer air ; there existed consequently
on the inner walls of the cylinder a condensation of aqueous vapour.
3. No particular indications are given as to the methods of purifying
the water in which the weighings were made, but considering the
fact that water once distilled without special precautions (as an ex
periment shows) very often has a specific gravity up to L0002,
taking that of pure water as unity, we may admit that the true
weight will be smaller than that obtained from Lefevre-Ginean's
investigations.
     From the above-mentioned determinations we must conclude that
the weight of a cubic decimetre of water in vacuo at 4° C. is not
greater than 999'96 grams, and hardly smaller than 999'76 grams.

  those  of M. Kupffer and Mr. Chaney have been carried out under all
  possible conditions necessary         for obtaining reliable results, those
                                      —
 conditions being as follows : Direct comparisons of the weights
 and measures used with the primary standards of weight and men-
 sure, accurate corrections of the thermometers, and particularly care
 in obtaining entirely pure water, which before the experiment was
 boiled so as to remove the dissolved air.*                 I therefore consider
 these determinations, introducing into them all corrections in a
 manner corresponding to our present experience, upon which                    I con
sider it here necessary to make the following statements.                      I have
 assumed : —
     1. One metre = 39-3700 + 0-0001 English inches, as it follows from
the combined reliable comparisons of Kater, Clark, and Tittmann.
It may be remembered that the Russian inch, according to the law,
is equal to the English inch, and that 1 cubic inch appears to be
equal to 16'38716 c.c. or 0'01638716 cubic decimetre.
     2. One pound avoirdupois = 453'59243 grams, as we see by the
recent comparisons of Mr. Chaney ; therefore 1 grain = 0-0647989
gram.
     3.  One Russian pound = 409-5120 +0-0005 grams, as appears
from the fact that Kupffer gives 409-51156 + 0-00072, and the pre
liminary weighings made at the Central Chamber of Weights and
 Measures in 1894 give 40951236 + 0-00022 grams.                           Therefore
 1 doli (a Russian pound contains 96 zolotniks a 96 dolias) = 0'0444349
gram.
     4.  For pure water (freed from dissolved air)            I assumed     that the
 change of the specific gravity (at 4° C. = 1) as depending upon the
temperature t° C. is represented by the following equation : —
                          S, =    l—-7 '--?

sion pour fixer les Mesures et les Poids de l'Empire de Russie (St.

of which from a number of measurements as a mean was found to                           be

 near 16§° C. I have, therefore, used the results of Fizeau. From the

      For the determinations of the diameters and heights of the small
   cylinders we rarely find a maximum difference between the separate
   measurements amounting to 0-00014 inch.                 From the mean results of
   a large number of measurements,            we must assume that the error in
   volume determination was not greater than + 0-00168 cubic inch, or
   less than the 1/14391 part of the total volume, which for a cubic
   decimetre corresponds to 0-069 gram.               In the measurements of the
   large cylinder having a diameter of about 4 inches, a greater accu
   racy has been obtained, so that the average error of the linear
   measurements was smaller than 0-00005 inch ; therefore the error in
    volume was smaller 'than 0'000190 cubic inch, corresponding to a
   relative error of less than 1/26263, or for 1 cubic decimetre less than
    0-038 gram.      We must therefore expect a greater accuracy from the
    determinations by means of the large cylinder than from those where
    the small cylinder was used.
       Although    I   have made in similar detail a new reduction of all
    Kupffer's data,    in  the further discussion      I  shall take into considera

tion only the data obtained by means of the large cylinder, especially
as    in all instances relating to the weighings they are much mon1
reliable and symmetrical, that is to say, the changes of -weight
follow uniformly with the changes of temperature.
    With the large cylinder (as with the small) Kupffer made many
series of alternate weighings in air and water.                    He first used ordi
nary      once  distilled   water, and   afterwards    water   which      was especially
prepared for him by the well-known chemists, Hess and Fritzsche.
According to all test proofs this water appeared to be pure, and
before the experiment it was boiled to remove the dissolved air.
Only data given for pure water are of the greatest importance.
From the data obtained with the water first used we can only con
clude that its density in relation to that of pure water appeared to
be 1-000128, if we judge from the corrected weighings of the large
cylinder.        We expect therefore to find that the weight of a cubit-
decimetre, using ordinary once distilled water, may give an increase
amounting to decigrams.
    The weight of the large cylinder in air was determined by thirty-
five weighings, distributed in six series, the mean results of which
are    :

    The results being so remarkably close to one another, we are per

 = 761-48 mm. ; h (pressure of aqueous vapour, humidity 61 per cent.)
 = 8-26 mm. ; t = 12-825° ; JR. = 1603° C. Hence we find e (weight
of litre of air) = 1*2205 grams, or the weight of a cubic inch of

 divisions, and only at the end of his investigation, as shown later on, established
 the relation of this pound to the standard Russian pound N ; the result being
 A = 1-00000933 dolias of a Russian pound.

air = 0'4501 A, the volume of the cylinder = 49-898 cubic inches,
and the volume of the weights = 8'156 cubic inches (sp. gr. = 8'51,
therefore volume of 3134 A weights = 1 cubic inch), we have for the
weight of the cylinder in vacuo, Pa = 25579-5725 A.* As the arbi
trary unit of weight A, as we shall see later on, weighs very nearly the
same as a dolia of a pound, that is to say about 44-4 millirgams, and
as the error of Kupffer's weighings is not less than 0'7 milligram, we
can assume the error in P3 to be +0012 A, and in the mean result
an even smaller error will be obtained.
   Having finished all his weighings, Kupffer (loc. cit., p. 342) deter
mined the relation of the weight of the arbitrary units A, by means of
which the weighings were made, to the weight of a standard Russian
pound, and after application of all necessary corrections, he came to
the conclusion that A was a little heavier than a dolia of true weight,
namely, A = 1-00000933 dolia.               Therefore P3 = 2557981 dolias.
   Kupffer made twenty-seven weighings of the large cylinder in
water, which, although distilled, subsequently appeared to be not
quite pure. All these weighings I have re-computed, t but I give
here only the final result, showing that at 13^° ft., the weight of the
displaced water (reduced to weighings in vacuo) is equal to 18382'00
dolias, which is evidently more than the weight (18379-19 dolias)
of the same volume of quite pure water prepared by Hess and
Fritzsche.       After having obtained this water, Kupffer made in it
twenty new full weighings of the same cylinder, arranging them in
five series of      four weighings each, the mean result of which we give
here, not   in the order of the weighings as made, but in the order of
the observed       temperatures of the water, so that the change of the
relation between the weight and the temperature (t) and the
symmetry of the obtained results may be apparent.

mentioned weight of a cubic inch of air (= 0'4501 A), and as the
volume of the weights = 2-298 cubic inches, the correction of the
observed weight, in order to obtain the real weight, will be
= — 1*0348 A ; or if we wish to express this weight in true dolias
of a Russian pound, we have to multiply the obtained numbers by
1-0000,933. The weight so corrected is given in the first column
(I) of the following table ; in the second column (II) we find the
weight pt of the displaced water, namely, the difference between
25579'81 dolias and the numbers of column II, corresponding to the
temperature t° R. (column III).
   In order to find the weight P of water displaced by the cylinder at
13^° R., we have evidently to multiply pt by the relation of the
specific gravity of water at 13 J° R. (= 0'998890) to the specific-
gravity S< at t° and by the relation of the volumes at 13^° R. to the
volumes at t° R., the latter relation being equal to

      This value is not only more reliable than those of Shuckburgh and
Lefevre-Gineau, becanse really pure water was hero used for the
first time and all means employed for obtaining a correct result, but
this value is also more probable than all the other results obtained by
Kupffer.*           It corresponds to pare well-boiled water and to the
largest of the cylinders employed by him ; so that all the data here
show a more evident uniformity than in the other Kupffer determina
 tions.
      This result, from observations made forty-five years ago by the
 Russian metrologist, obtains special importance in consequence
 of the publication                in 1892 in the 'Phil. Trans.' (vol. 183,
 pp. 331 — 354) of investigations on the weight of a cubic inch of
 water, made in the year 1888 by the contemporary English metro
 logist, Mr. H. J. Chaney, because the latter not only took care to
 obtain quite pure water (and by boiling removed the dissolved air),
 not only employed apparatus and methods carefully tested, but also
  took a cylinder and a sphere of considerably larger dimensions than
  the largest used by Kupffer. f By its especially large dimensions (about
  Kupffer, the most probable value of P, the result being identical with the P above
  found;     but I consider it more regular to proceed in the way I have accepted,
  because in the same all entering values, especially S(, have a real meaning, and
  because I have also used this method in the discussion of Mr. Chaney's observations.
      * Thus, after a full computation of the other determinations of Kupffer, I
  obtained for the weight ta vacuo of a cubic inch of water at 13§° R. from the

    for the cubic decimetre of water ut its maximum density, the weight 999374

     The considerable differences in the numbers of the last column
 show that in most of the observations there were air bubbles, which
 Mr. Chaney (loc. cit., p. 347) especially mentions in the discussion of
 the weighings.            As the air bubbles diminish the weight of C in
 water, that is to say apparently increase the weight of the water, one
 must believe that only in two weighings (marked with an asterisk),
 Nos. 1 and 3, no bubbles, or very few, were shown, and 1 therefore
 take for the computation these two weighings only. According to
 them, the mean weight of water at 58-4° F. is PS6.4 = 144704-05 grains ;
 but as the volume of C (according (o IV) at this temperature
 Yx.t = 572-744125, we have for the weight of a cubic inch of water
 at 58-4° F. = 252-6504 grains. The specific gravity of water at this
 temperature being equal to 0999201, it follows that the weight, in
 vacuo, of a cubic decimetre of water at its maximum density (4° C.)
 is equal to 9998414 grams.
     This result, being so close to that (9998495 grams) deduced from
 the best observations of Kupffer, shows at once that the method
 selected by us gives useful results.          It is confirmed by determinations
 made by Mr. Chaney by means of a brass sphere S, having a diameter
 of about 6 inches. The volume of the same V6J at 62D F. = 112-669406
 cubic inches, and according to formula III,
              V, = V„[l + 0-00003018 (t— 62)       +0000000009 (t— 62)s].
     Five very closely accordant weighings of S in air gave a mean
 weight of 28409913 grains, at the mean temperature t = 59-21° F.,
 H0 = 3027" ; therefore the weight of 1 cubic inch of air =
 0'3123 grain, and the weight of S, in vacuo, = 28440-778 grains.

    Although the probable error of this result barely reaches the milli
 grams,   it will be most correct to assume that the true value lies
 between the limits from 99985 to 999-82 grams, because the method
 of hydrostatical weighings hitherto used does not guarantee complete
 absence of air bubbles, but the coincidence between the results of
 Knpffei and Chaney gives assurance that the probable weight is
 not larger than 99985 grams, but possibly a little smaller, about

156       Messrs. Leake, Leventhorpe, and Whitehead.              [Dec. 5,
After describing Lord Kelvin's method of multiplying a comparatively
small known potential difference by means of a series of condensers, a
full account is given of the method adopted by Professor Ayrton and
Mr. T. Mather for the calibration of their electrostatic voltmeters.
The apparatus is arranged for the determination of alternating
potential differences up to several thousand volts, either by measure
ment of the current passing through a non-inductive manganin resist
ance of about 20,000 ohms, or by comparison with the steady potential
difference of the Clark standard cell, in a way that does not involve
any measurements of resistance.       A full description is given of the
apparatus employed, and the methods of using it.            It is probable
that the measurements made in this way of potential differences of
about 2000 volts are correct to about Jg per cent, in absolute unite.
    In Part II the authors discuss the measurement of high potential
difference in terms of the absolute electrostatic unit by means of the
Kelvin absolute electrometer. With the object of determining the
degree of accuracy in the indications of this instrument, a sensitive
Ayrton-Mather electrostatic voltmeter was calibrated both in electro
static and in electromagnetic units, in the former unit by the absolute
electrometer, and in the latter unit by the method described in Part I.
A comparison of these two calibration curves yielded values for the
ratio of the electrostatic unit to the electromagnetic unit of potential
difference; and, by comparing these values with the mean of recent
independent researches on the ratio of the units (2-998 x 1010 cm. per
second), an approximate idea could be formed as to the accuracy of
the measurements made by the absolute electrometer. By experi
ments such as this it was found that the results given by the absolute
electrometer were always too large by an average error of 1-J per cent.
   An experiment made on the coach-springs, with all electrical effects
eliminated, showed that the cause of this error lay in a gradual alteration
in the strength of the springs during the electrometer measurements.
The main part of this alteration in strength was due to the gradual
yield on loading the springs, and, in a long series of experiments
made subsequently, this difficulty was overcome           by keeping the
springs constantly loaded (except during actual use) with the weights
required for the measurements.
   The remaining part of the alteration in strength was due to change
in the temperature of the coach-springs, and the error thus caused
is of importance if maximum accuracy is essential.
   Three methods are enumerated by which this temperature error
can be overcome, the first of which was not, at that time, tried
because it would have involved considerable structural alteration to
the instrument.     The second method, which consists in enclosing the
 whole instrument in a non-conducting case to minimise the rate of
change of temperature, was tried, but was not found to be sufficiently

1895.]       Tke Measurement of High Potential Difference.            157
effective. Finally a method was devised by which a proper tempera
ture correction could be easily calculated without necessitating any
additional readings, and which has the great advantage that the
coach-springs themselves are virtually used as a metallic theynometer
to indicate their own temperature, and this method of correction was
found to be quite satisfactory. The greatest value of this tempera
ture correction in a large number of subsequent measurements of
potential difference was found to be ^ per cent.
    A description is next given of a lengthy series of experiments to
determine values for " v " (the ratio of the units) in order to test the
a; curacy of the electrometer when employed according to the authors'
                                                    "
            The results show that the values of " v in each experiment

form a very consistent set among themselves, but that the sets taken
on different days do not always agree with one another, on some days
the mean value obtained for "o" being about 2999 xlO10, while on
other days it was about 2"985 x 10'°. The explanation of this is that
the electrometer was on some days measuring quite correctly             in
absolute units, in so far as we were able to judge, while on other
days its measurements were almost uniformly too high by about
.i per cent.
    This result tends to show that in the instrument used by the
authors there is some defect, probably of a mechanical nature, which
causes an intermittent error of such a nature that, when it occurs, it
is almost always approximately the same in magnitude.         The authors
spent some time trying to detect the cause of this error, which
appeared to be inherent, at any rate in this specimen, of the absolute
 electrometer, but they failed to arrive at a satisfactory explanation.
    By employing the various precautions adopted by the authors, the
 mean of a number of measurements of a potential difference made
with this absolute electrometer, in the way described in the paper,
 may be relied on as being correct, certainly to within ^ per cent, in
absolute electrostatic units, if 2'9y8 x 1010 is the true value of "v."
 On the days that the special error, already referred to, did not exist,
the measurements were correct to about T^ per cent.          Part  II con
cludes with a description of some alterations, suggested by the
authors' experiments, which will be carried out in the instrument
 with which these experiments were made.
    In Appendix I are theoretically investigated the most suitable values
 of the mass to be used for the initial adjustment of the springs, and
 of the potential difference to which the electrometer jar is to be
 charged, for the measurement of a given potential difference in the
 heterostatic method. The results show that, in order that the prob
 able error shall be as small as possible, the potential difference of the
 electrometer jar should be proportional to the potential difference to
 be measured, and the mass should be proportional      to the f-povyer of

the potential difference to be measured.         The general working of the
intrnment is also considered, and numerical results and curves are
given for the electrometer used by the authors.
   In Appendix    II is considered the question of the redaction of the
readings to absolute measure, or, in other words, the calculation of
the effective area of the attracted disk.        Starting from an expression
given by Professor J. J. Thomson, a formula is deduced for the effec
tive area of the disk when in the plane of the guard-ring, which is
probably more accurate than that given by Maxwell.                   It is then
shown that, in addition to the well-known advantages of the hetero-
static over the idiostatic method of measurement, there is the addi
tional advantage that the error in the ordinary assumption as to the
value of the effective area is of far less importance in the former
than in the latter method.      Finally an investigation is given in which
Schwarz's method is applied to determine the error in the ordinary
assumption as to the value of the effective area for the case when the
disk and guard-ring are not quite in the same plane.

I. '-On     the   Determination of the Indices of Refraction of
      various Substances for the Electric Ray.               I. Index of
      Refraction of Sulphur."           By Professor J. C. Bose, B.A.
      (Cantab.), B.Sc. (Lond.).              Communicated       by Lord
      Rayleigh, Sec. R.S. Received October 20, 1895.
    The indices of refraction of transparent substances • have been
determined by the usual optical methods.            There is still a large
number of substances like the various rocks, wood, brick, coal-tar,
and others which are not transparent to light, so that their indices
could not be obtained. These substances are, however, transparent
to electric radiation ; and the present investigation was undertaken
to tind a direct method of determining their indices with a sufficient
amount of accuracy.
    Even in the case of optically transparent substances, the indices
are only known for the narrow range of light waves.            For greater
wave lengths, the index is inferred from Cauchy's formula. Professor
 Langley has, however, shown that this formula fails to give trust
 worthy results when applied to the dark radiations in the infra-red
portion of the spectrum.       It does not, therefore, seem at all likely
that the above formula will give accurate results when applied to the
electric radiation.
    For the determination of the index for the electric ray, the prism
 method is unsuitable.     In the well-known Hertz's experiment with
the pitch prism, the deviation of the refracted rays extended from 11°
to 34°.      The approximate value of /<, = 169, obtained from this
 experiment, is probably higher than the true value by about 15 to 20
 per cent.

    For the accurate measurement of deviation, the      effect produced  by
radiation on the receiver should undergo an abrupt variation.        When
the radiation passes from a dense to a light medium, at a certain
critical angle of incidence, the radiation is totally reflected.      From
the critical angle the index of refraction is easily determined. The
great advantage of this method lies in the fact that the transition
from refraction to total reflection is very sudden.
    I have determined the /t of various substances for the electric ray,
by the method of total reflection.
    It will be seen from the results of the experiments, that this method
is capable of giving very good results.
    The refracting substance is cut out or cast in the form of a semi-
cylinder, and mounted on the central table of a spectrometer; the
electric ray is directed towards the centre of the spectrometer, and
its direction is always kept fixed. It strikes the curved surface and
passes into its mass without any deviation.        It is then incident on
the plane surface of the semi-cylinder, and is refracted into the air
beyond.
    The incident angle on the plane surface is increased or decreased
by rotating the central table on which the cylinder rests. In practice,
it is more convenient to commence the experiment with an angle of
incidence greater than the critical angle, the incident ray being then
                                   Fig. 1.
totally reflected. The angle of incidence is slowly decreased till the
critical value is reached. At this point the ray is all at once refracted
into the air, making an angle of 90° with the normal to the surface.
 If a receiver be fixed against the side of the semi-cylinder at R, it
 will now respond to tho refracted radiation.
    The platform on which the cylinder rests, carries the usual index.
 By alternately rotating the platform in one direction or the other,
 and   observing   the position of the index when the receiver just
 responds,   the reading for the critical angle is obtained with great

accuracy.   The receiver is now placed at R', and the cylinder rotated
in the opposite direction till total reflection again takes place. The
difference between the first and second readings is evidently equal to
twice the critical angle.
   To utilise only the central rays, a metallic screen with a small
central opening is placed against the plane face of the semi-cylinder.
In order that all the rays should undergo total reflection simultane
ously, it is necessary that the rays incident on the plane of separation
of the two media should be parallel.     This is effected by the cylinder
itself.  From the approximate value of        found from a preliminary
                                                ft.

                                                                    is
lated. The spaik-gap of the radiator       placed at this focus, and the
                                           is
rays thus rendered very near parallel. Each subsequent experiment
gives a more accurate value of /i, and from the corrected value of the
focal distance thus obtained, a more accurate adjustment        made for  is
the next experiment.
                                 Apparatus Used.
  The apparatus used consists of an electric radiator emitting short
waves, large graduated circle provided with
       a                                        central circular plat
                                                           a
form on which the refracting substance              placed, and a receiver,
                                                      is
which responds to the electric radiation.
    The Radiator. — have given a detailed description of the electric
                      I
radiator in my paper on polarisation of electric rays (vide Journal,
Asiatic Society of Bengal, Part       2,No.  2, 1895).    Electric oscillation
is  produced by sparking between two metallic           beads  and an inter
posed metallic sphere      1cm. in diameter. By a single sudden break
of the primary in a RuhmkorfFs coil, a flash of radiation              emitted.
                                                                          is
The spark gap     is placed at one  end of  a brass tube     cm.5in  diameter.
By a sliding arrangement, the length of the tube may be varied.
The Ruhtnkorff's coil     isenclosed in a copper box.
    The Circle. — The circle has a diameter of 45 cm., and          graduated
                                                                         is
into degrees, but one-fourth of a degree may be easily estimated.
The circle, as a whole, may rotate round vertical axis which passes
                                                a
though the centre of a massive stand.           There       a raised circular
                                                               is
platform at the centre of the circle on which the refracting substance
is  placed. This platform carries an index, and may be rotated inde
pendently of the large circle. When the platform index                    is
                                                                      clamped,
the two circles rotate together.
    The h'cfracting Substance. — For snbstances which can be cast. the
molten mass      ispoured into a cylindrical mould with a thin partition
in the middle. In this way two equal semi-cylinders are obtained at
each casting.      Substances like wood or stone are turned, and the
 cylinder  sawn   into  two eqnal halves. In my experiments different
 sized cylinders were used.      Ihave successfully used small ones with

1895.]            of various  Substances  for the  Electric Ray.           Ifi3
a radius of 8 cm. only. But when the cost of the material is not
prohibitive, it is advisable to use fairly large cylinders. The cylin
ders nsed in the following experiments were 27"4 cm. in diameter,
 and 10 cm. or more in height. For liquids, the cylindrical glass
 trough nsed has a diameter of 25 cm.
      The tube of the radiator is fixed and points to the centre of the
 graduated circle. The vertical central line of the cylinder passes
 through the centre of the circular platform.
      The Receiver. — The receiver is a modified form of the coherer.        In
 a rectangular piece of ebonite a narrow groove is cut out.             In this
  groove bits of coiled steel springs are arranged side by side, only one
  layer deep. In this way a linear receiver is constructed with a
  sensitive surface 2 cm. in length and 4 mm. in breadth. By means
  of a screw, the springs may be gradually compressed, reducing the
  resistance.     The coherer is in a circuit with an aperiodic D'Arsonval
  galvanometer and a copper-iron cell.              The galvanometer has a
  resistance of 300 oh ms, and the voltaic cell has an E.M.F. of about
   0'45 volt. A Daniell cell is sometimes nsed, with a resistance box as a
   shunt; the E.M.F. may thus be adjusted to suit the sensitiveness of
   the receiver. When the spiral spring coherer is freshly made, it is
   over sensitive. On the second day it settles down to a fair condition,
   thongh at first for about half an hour its action is rather unsteady.
   But afterwards the sensitiveness becomes fairly uniform. It will
   maintain this state under favourable conditions for nearly an hour ;
   after which it begins to lose its sensitiveness.      It must also be borne
   in mind that the sparking balls are also undergoing deterioration.
   The sensitiveness of the coherer may be partially restored by sub
   jecting it to electric radiation at close quarters, and slightly raising
   the E.M.F. of the circuit.      In this way it is sometimes possible to
   work continuously for about two hours ; but greater weight should
   of course be given to the first sets of observations, which are taken
   at a time when the receiver is most sensitive.
       It is superfluous to add that special precautions should be taken to
   guard against the disturbance due to stray radiations.          The walls of
   the room,    the table, even the  person of  the  experimenter himself may
   act as reflectors, scattering the rays in all directions.     I spent a con
   siderable time in trying to find a substanco        that will act as a good
   absorber. Lamp black is useless, as it reflects copiously.          Blotting
   paper soaked in water or copper sulphate solution does produce a
   certain amount of absorption ; but even with these a certain amount
    of reflection is found to take place.
       By proper screening, the disturbance due to stray radiations may,
    however, be got rid of. The radiating apparatus, with the excep
    tion of a tubular opening, is completely enclosed in a metallic box.
    The radiator tube extends right up to the refracting cyliudcr.          The

foil.
                             Method   of Experiment.
   I  first tried to determine the index of refraction of sulphur.                  The
material used wns ordinary commercial sulphur.                    A semi-cylinder
was    made,   and the two positions for total reflection determined by
the method which has already been described.                    The difference of
readings found for the two positions varied from 69° to 71° and the
value of the critical angle would from these experiments seem to lie
 between 34-5° and 35°. This approximate value for the critical angle
having been obtained, the experiment was modified to secure a greater
amount of accuracy.
   Two equal semi-cylinders P and Q were taken and placed on the
rotating table face to face, with an air film between.                    A metallic
plate with a narrow rectangular opening was also interposed between
                                      Pig.   2.
the semi- cylinders to serve as a diaphragm and cut off all but the
central rays.      When the spark gap is placed at O, the principal
focus of P, the rays emerge parallel into the air film, and are then
focussed by the second cylinder at an equal distance                /   on the other
side.
   The spark gap is placed at 0, and the receiver at 0', 00' being extre
mities of a diameter passing through the centre of the circle.                     The
air film is for convenience placed parallel to the index.
   The platform carrying the cylinders is now rotated, say to the left.
                                      Fio.   3.

The angle of incidence is thus gradually increased, till the rays just
undergo total reflection. When this is the case the receiver ceases to
respond.    Let A be the corresponding reading of the platform index.
A stationary index I' is now placed opposite the reading A of the
graduated circle.
    When the cylinder is rotated in the opposite direction a second
reading B for the critical angle is obtained.               It is obvious that,
                       —
neglecting errors, A B is equal to twice the critical angle.
    The platform index is now clamped and the circle as a whole is
rotated till B comes opposite to the fixed index I'. The circle is now
clamped, the platform arm undamped, and the central table rotated
till another reading C for the critical angle is obtained. Then, as in
the previous case, B — C = 2i, where i is the critical angle.               The
circle as a whole is now Totated till C comes opposite the fixed index.

    Thus at each successive operation the circle is rotated past the
 fixed index through 2t.      The successive difference of readings of the
 circle in reference to the fixed outside index, thus gives a series of
 values of 2i.
    The result will be more accurate if wo take the mean readings
 i(A + B), i(B + C),              and take their differences.        Successive
 readings are taken till the      graduated      circle is  rotated as  near as
 possible through 360°.
    As has been said before,       there are two semi-cylinders        P and Q.
 In the first set of experiments P is turned towards the radiator,
 Q acting as a focussing lens.      The circle at each successive operation
 moves in a right-handed direction.
    In the second set of experiments Q is turned towards the radiator,
 P acting as the converging lens. Successive readings are taken as
 before, the circle now rotating     in a hft-handed direction.

   It will  be observed that the final results obtained from the two sets
are freed from many of the unavoidable errors.
  I  give below the results of two sets of experiments each extending
through eleven observations.                  The receiver .was. in an unusually
good     condition    for  nearly    an  hour,     and during that time I took six
observations with P to the front and six more with Q in the same
position.     As the receiver continued to remain in a fairly responsive
condition I took five more for each set. As I have said already,
greater weight should be given to the first two sets of six readings,
as being taken under the most favourable conditions.
   In the first two lines are given ten successive differences of the mean
readings, taken with the cylinders P and Q.

   With the co-operation of the Trustees of the University Museum
of Basel     and   Professor Riitimeyer, the author has examined the
fossil described by      Dr. Robert Wiedersheim in 1878 as Labyrhitho-
don  Riitimeyeri.      The bones are differently interpreted : —
   The  reputed humerus is the interclavicle.
   The   reputed scapula is the humerus.
   The   reputed supra-scapula is the left coracoid.
   The   reputed supra-scapula is the right scapula.
   The  reputed right and left coracoids are the pre-coracoid and cora
        coid of the right side.
   The reputed clavicles are the ribs.
Five  digits are identified in place of four in 1878.

 168        Structure, Organisation, §-c,   of Fossil Reptilia.   [Dec. 12,
     These osteological identifications are inconsistent with reference
 of the type to the Labyrinthodontia.        The author also examines the
 relation of the Labyrinthodont type to existing Amphibia, and
 regards the Labyrinthodont osteology as demonstrating closer rela
 tionship with Ichthyosauria and Anomodontia.          The group is there
 fore regarded as reptilian, forming a branchiate division of the class.
    The fossil is referred to a new genus — Aristodesmus.       It is identi
 fied as an Anomodont reptile chiefly on the basis of resemblances to
 Procolophnn and Pareiasaurus.      It is shown not to be a mammal by
 the large parietal foramen, the composite structure of the lower jaw,
 and presence of the pre-frontal bone.           It, however, differs from
 known Anomodonts in making a somewhat closer approximation to
 Monotreme mammals than has hitherto been evident, and this corre
 spondence extends to successive segments of both the fore and hind
limbs.
    The teeth are in sockets placed obliquely, with conical crowns
 compressed to sharp lateral margins, and curved inward.           The pro
portions of the vertebral column are those of Echidna, though the
 transverse processes are longer, as in Pareiasanrus.         The ribs are
like those of a Monotreme, though the sacral ribs are longer. The
 shoulder girdle resembles that of Procolophon, and differs from all
other Anomodonts in the constituent bones being unanchylosed, and
in the precoracoid having a large anterior extension in advance of
the scapula.       The sternum appears to have been nnossified as in
Crocodilia.      The humerus is widely expanded at both extremities
and    twisted, but does not show the peculiar lateral curvature seen in
Monotremes. The ulna gives no evidence of an olecranon process ;
it is larger than the radius, and appears to articulate with the
humerus. The pelvic bones are without acetabular or obturator per
forations, are not anchylosed together, and the ilium is not expanded
transversely.     The hind limb is no larger than the fore limb.         The
femur is more slender than the bone in Echidna.          The fibula is pro
longed proximally beyond the stout tibia, round which it may rotate.
The proximal row of the tarsus is one large bone, formed of the
blonded astragalus and os calcis.
    In conclusion, the author argues that the points of structure are so
few in which Monotreme mammals make a closer approximation to
the higher mammals than is seen in this fossil and other Anomo
dontia, that the Monotreme resemblances to fossil reptiles become
increased in importance.     He believes that a group Theropsida might
be made to include Monotremata and Anomodontia, the principal
differences (other than those of the skull) being that monotremes
preserve the marsupial bones, the atlas vertebra, and certain cranial
sutures. Ornithorhynchus shows pre-frontal and post-frontal bones,
and has the malar arch formed as in Anomodonts.

   Octonions is a name adopted for various reasons in place of
Clifford's Bi-quaternions.
   Formal quaternions are symbols which formally obey all the laws
of the quaternion symbols, q (quaternion), x (scalar), p (vector)                          <j>
(linear function in both its ordinary meanings),          (conjugate of </i),
                                                                 0'
Sji      k?   Ky, Sg, Tg, Ug, Yq. Octonions are in this sense formal
              £,
quaternions.        Each octonion symbol, however, requires for its
specification just double the number of scalars required for the
corresponding quaternion symbol. Thus, of every quaternion formula
involving the above symbols there                geometrical interpretation
                                                      is
                                                      a
more general than the ordinary quaternion one, an octonion interpre
tation.    The new interpretation, like the old, treats space impar
tially, i.e., it has no special reference to an arbitrarily chosen origin
or system of axes.
    If   Qis an octonion and         a quaternion, the symbols, which in
                                          q
octonions corresponds Kg, Sg, Tg, Ug, Vgin quaternions, are denoted
 by KQ, SQ, TQ, UQ,' MQ. KQ              called the conjugate of
                                                is                  SQ the    Q,

increase mentioned ; and T2Q is an " additor," i.e., it effects the
addition-increase mentioned. The amonnt hy which the pitch of the
motor operand A is increased is called the pitch of the octonion
operator Q. When a motor B is itself thns considered as an operator
its versor is a quadrantal versor and its translator is unity, i.e., it
does not translate the operand at all ; hence the twister of a motor
is a quadrantal versor. The tensor of B is the magnitude of its rotor
part, and the amount by which it increases the pitch of the operand
is its own pitch.
   These results are all established by aid of quaternions on a purely
Euclidean basis.     They have, of course, mechanical interpretations
in connection with (1) the instantaneous motion of a rigid body, (2)
 a system of forces, (3) the momentum of a system of moving matter,
 and (4) a system of impulses. The corresponding motors are called
velocity motors (Sir Robert Ball's i: twist on a screw "), force motors
 ("wrench on a screw"), momentum motors, and impulse motors
 (" impulsive wrench"). If A and B are two force motors A+B is
the force motor of the system of forces obtained by the composition
of the two systems corresponding to A and B ; and similarly for the
motors of the other types.
    The octonion operator Q( )Q-1 is exactly analogous to the qua-
terion operator q( )q~1.     It displaces the octonion operand in the
 most general manner as a rigid body ; it translates the operand
 parallel to the axis of Q through a distance double of that through
 which Q when regarded as a motor operator translates the motor;
and it rotates it as a rigid body round the axis of Q through double
 The angle of Q.   If A is the velocity motor of a rigid body which in
 the time t has suffered the displacement Q( )Q-',

   The geometrical connections between A, B (two motors), MAB, and
SAB are examined. The axis of MAB is the shortest distance
between A and B. Its rotor part bears the same relation to the rotor
parts of A and B that the vector Vaft does to the vectors x and     The

   If X   is root of the 0 cubic that cubic can always be put in the form
(0— X)(03— N'0+N) = 0, even when there is no second root. If X
corresponds to a single root of the 0i cubic (0-— N'0+N)E = 0, if E
is any motor which intersects a certain line perpendicularly.         If X
corresponds to a repeated root of the 0i cubic, the statement is not
always true.
   Except when all the roots of the 0i cubic are equal there is always
tome line such that if E be any motor coaxial with the line, 0E is also
coaxial with the line. [When all the roots of the 0t cubic are equal
the statement is sometimes trne and sometimes nntrue.]
   Let, now, 0 stand for a real commutative self-conjugate. It can
then always be put in the form —
                     0E =  -XiSEi-X'jSEj-X"kSEk,
where   X, X', X" are three real scalar octonions, and i,j,    k are  three
mutually perpendicular unit intersecting rotors.             The cubic is
    —
(0 X)(0— X')(0 X")    —      =  0, so  that it always has three real roots.
These may be taken as X, X', X", even when it has an infinite number
of roots. In this last case the X, X', X" of the equation 0E =
 — Xi'SEi — .  ...  have definite values which are called the principal
roots of the cubic. Thus, there are always three mutually perpen
dicular intersecting lines such that if E be a motor coaxial with any
one of them, 0E is coaxial with E.
   If two, but not three, of the roots of the 0] cubic are equal, and
the two corresponding principal roots of the 0 cubic are unequal, 0
cannot-be put in the form —
                             0E = MAEB + YE,
where A and B are constant motors and Y a constant scalar octo-
nion.    In all other cases 0 can be put in this form, and A, B, and Y.
are real. The cubic is
                   {(0-Y)3-A3B3}{(0-Y) + SAB} st 0.
When neither       A nor B is a lator and they are not parallel,  the prin
cipal axes (the three lines mentioned just now), of 0 are the shortest
distance of A and B, and the two lines which bisect this shortest
distance and also bisect the angles between A and B.
   A scalar octonion may be of any oue of five types ; one type is zero
and the other four may be called positive and negative, scalar octo
nions and positive and negative scalar converters. If A and B are
two motors (not parallel and neither a mere lator), such that SA0B,
 = 0, A and B are said to be fully conjugate with regard to 0. If
A, B, C are three such motors of which each pair is fully conjugate
 the number of the scalar octonions SA0A, SB0B, SC0C, of any
 type is the same as the number of the principal roots of the samo

type.    Making this fact the basis of a classification, it follows that
there are (rejecting the case 0 = 0), thirty-four different types of 0.
   If ^ is a commutative self -conjugate, such that SiE^E is negative,
and not zero for all motor values (except lators) of E, there are always
three (and generally only three) real lines which are not all parallel
to one plane such that any three real motors with these lines for axes
form a fully conjugate set both with regard to ^ and 0.
   A commutative self-conjugate is never a complete energy function,
and can only be a partial energy function when it degenerates into a
lator function.
   The properties of the general function are examined by the help of
 " Grassmann's Ausdehungslehre."           Motors are in Grassmann's own
geometrical interpretations quantities of the second order. " Inner
Multiplication," and the thory of " Normals," have in this case inter
pretations which depend on an arbitrarily chosen origin.                Hence
Grassmann does not apply his theories concerning these two to
motors ; but motors may be treated as quantities of the first order,
and if they are, and if Sir Robert Ball's meaning of " reciprocal " is
identified with Grassmann's meaning of " normal " a real motor with
negative pitch is a "simple imaginary" quantity of the first order,
and the " numerical value " of a lator or a rotor is zero.         Grassmann
generally  assumes   his quantities to  be real  and  always  assumes   that a
quantity is zero when its numerical value is zero. Hence nearly all
his theorems require modification in our case but his methods are
generally with some extensions applicable.

particular scalar combinatornal product of six motors is much used
and also a motor combinatornal product of five motors. The latter
is the motor (with a certain definite tensor) reciprocal to the five
motors of the product. By aid of these two products, the following
results (the first of which is contained in Ball's " Screws ") are estab
lished. To every complex of order n there is a complex of order 6 — n
reciprocal and no motor not belonging to the latter, is reciprocal to
the former. If (n) be a complex of order n, and (6— n) an indepen
dent complex of order 6— n, then     if (ti— n) is the complex reciprocal to

 (ABA'B'), and with (ABA'B'CC) makes up (n). The individual

 may be taken as any independent motors which with C,, C2. . . . form
 the determinate complex (CD) ; similarly for C/, C./. . . . ; but not
similarly for D/,       Da'
     The table is much simplified, (1) when w is an energy function and
 (2) when w = I and n = 6.
     If w is any self-conjugate and E is one of a set of six conjugate
 motors, such that sEarE = 0, then arE = 0. If w is an energy function
 (partial) and E is any motor, such that sEic-E = 0, then wTi = 0.

         (a general self- conjugate) can always be expressed in an infinite
 number of ways in the form a-E = — 2/FsEF, where F is one of six
real constant independent motors, and               /  a corresponding ordinary
scalar, which may be zero.              The six motors which are reciprocal to
each set of five of the F's form a conjugate set.              When none of the
/'s are zero u--1 has a unique intelligible meaning. The F's form a
conjugate set with regard to ar~l.
    When (») and (to) are given the numbers of motors of the different
types A, A', &c., are all definite numbers characteristic of w. There
are thus when n — 6, two methods of classifying w.                 The number of
types of w (rejecting the case w = 0), when classified according as
it affects motors in (m) only, is 2, 5, 9, 14, 20, or 27, when m has the
value 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 respectively.               The number of types of
vt, when classified according as it affects motors in (in) and in a semi-
conjugate complex (6— to), is 27, 77, 125, 14o, 125, 77, or 27, when m
has the value 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 respectively.

 A, B are any two independent motors of a complex of the second
 order the pitch of MAB is constant. Or adopting the rotation above

constant in the second case.

ever possible as consisting of reciprocal motors with axes along
mutually perpendicular intersecting lines, are given; as also the
reciprocal complexes in a similar form.
    The differentiation of octonion functions is considered.
    It is shown that physical problems may be treated in a manner
which, so far as appears from the present trials is in most cases prac
tically identical with quaternion method. A symbolic rotor v is
defined, which has properties very similar to the vector v of quater
nions.      Integration theorems corresponding to the well known
quaternion ones are given. The octonion treatment of strain and of
intensities and fluxes is given at some length. The octonion formulae,
though bearing a somewhat more extended meaning than the quater
nion formulae, are surprisingly similar in form to the latter. On the
whole, from this part of the paper, it cannot be said that octonions
prove more efficient than quaternions, though what would appear
were the subject more developed cannot at present be said.
   The following are some of the applications made in the last
division of the paper : —
   A twist    means  a general displacement of a rigid body.         A twist
can always be effected      in an infinite number of ways by two rotations.
The following      construction suffices to find any two such rotations.
Take any line 1 intersecting the axis of the twist perpendicularly.
Let 1 become 2 when it is subjected to half the given twist. Take
any transversal 3 of 1 and 2. Then double the rotation that converts
1 into 3, followed by double the rotation that converts 3 into 2, will
effect. the given twist.      A  right-about-turn  means a rotation through
two right angles ;    thus it is completely specified by its  axis. A twist
can always be effected in an infinite number of ways by two right
about-turns.      The following suffices to obtain the axes in all cases.
The axis of the first right-about-turn is any line intersecting the
axis of the twist perpendicularly.         The second axis is obtained from
the   first  by giving   to   the latter  half  the given twist.   As is well
known, two equal parallel and opposite rotations combine into a
translation.     The translation is compounded of two translations, the

one   being equal and parallel to the perpendicular from the first-
axis on the second, and the other equal and parallel to the same
perpendicular when it has been first rotated with the second rotation
and then reversed.    To combine two twists, take two lines, 1 and 2,
such that half tho first twist brings I into coincidence with the
shortest distance between the axes, and half the second twist brings
the shortest distance into coincidence with two. Then the axis of
the resultant twist is the shortest distance between I and 2 and the
twist itself double the twist about this axis, which will bring 1 into
coincidence with 2.

   The octonion treatment of the motion of a single rigid body is con
sidered at some length.     The treatment is very analogous in many
parts to the quaterion treatment of the motion of a rigid body with
one point fixed. The variation in time of the pitch and position of
the velocity motor of a rigid body subject to no external forces is
considered.
  This leads to the consideration of a curve — called the " normal
           "
cone curve — related to the polhode. The polhode lies on a quadric
cone whose vertex is the centre of the Poinsot ellipsoid. The normal
cone curve lies on the quadric cone whose vertex is the same point,
and which is normal to the polhode cone. Defining a polhode as the
locus of points on a quadric at which the tangent planes touch a
concentric sphere, it is shown that a real polhode on a real quadric is
always a polhode on a second real coaxial quadric, and that the
normal cone curve is a polhode on each of two other coaxial quadrics
which are both real or both imaginary.             The original polhode is
similar and similarly situated  to  the  normal   cone curve of the original
normal cone curve when the latter is regarded as a polhode. Several
reciprocal relations between the two pairs of quadrics are established.
If either of the original polhode quadrics is an hyperboloid of two
sheets, the normal cone curve quadrics are imaginary, though the
normal cone curvo itself is always real. When the four quadrics are
all real, not more than three of them can be ellipsoids, though they
may all be hyperboloids of one sheet.          A figure drawn to scale is
given  in which  each  pair consists  of  an ellipsoid and an hyperboloid
of one sheet, and in which each polhode is identical with the normal
cone curve of the other.     The two polhode quadrics coalesce if, and
only  if,one  is
               a  sphere.   The general solution given breaks down in
certain limiting cases. These cases are examined, and all prove to
have simple geometrical properties.        The methods adopted in these
particular operations are to all intents and purposes quaternion
methods, and they illustrate, what appears frequently throughout tho

1895.]        The Formation and Structure     of Dental Enamel.        181
paper,    that quaternion methods may be regarded practically as a par
ticular case of octonion methods.
    When the motion of the rigid body is always in the neighbourhood
of an absolutely stable position we get the theory of " Screws."       The
more general theorems       in connection with this are given in a some
what different form from Sir Robert Ball's. Thus, for instance, we
have a
           " generalised force motor," which in a particular case becomes
the
      "  reduced wrench." It is pointed out that the latter is not alwaj-s
intelligible.     Some form of the former is always intelligible, as also
is a particular form of it called the " virtual force motor."     The cor
                "                        "
responding virtual impulse motor is the impulse motor due to the
external impulses and the reactions of the constraints, but a similar
statement does not hold for the virtual force motor

        Professor Schafer, F.R.S.        Received December 4, 1394.

    The special points in the formation and structure of enamel which
 1  have attempted to elucidate in this paper may be summarised as
follows : —
    1st. The existence of a very thin membrane, or a structure of
 membrane-like appearance, lying between the ameloblasts and the
 forming enamel, and also between these cells and those of the stratum
 intermedium.       I have also, in many specimens, seen a similar mem
 brane covering the odontoblasts.
    2nd. The formation of enamel by deposit and not by cell calcifica
 tion.     This deposit probably consists of two distinct cell products — a
 granular plasm and spherules of calcoglobulin.
     3rd. The relation of the cells of the stratum intermedium to true
 secreting tissue ; this relation being especially marked in the enamel
 organs of the rat and mouse.
     4th. An intricate vascular network in the stratum intermedium.
                                 I
  I should also mention that have seen a free distribution of blood
 vessels in the odontoblastic layer of cells in the mouse, rat, and calf,
 as well as in human embryos, thus conclusively proving that these
  cells are not calcified.
     5th. The fibrous character of enamel in many of the lower animals,
  and the change of these fibres into more or less regularly arranged
  granules in the monkey and in man.
     6th. That the varicosities of the enamel rods are not caused by
  acids (although often rendered more clear to view by acid treatment)

 182       The Healing     of Incisions     in Vegetable Tissues.           [Dec- 12,
but represent a true structural peculiarity of this tissue.               That these
varicosities, which often continue in an uninterrupted line across
 large fields of view, correspond with the course of one set of fibres.
 The varicosities may, therefore, be caused by the presence of this set
of cross fibres. The only alternative explanation which has occurred
to me is that there may be a rhythmic, simultaneous action of all the
nmeloblasts concerned in the deposit of the material for enamel
 building.    The last theory seems to be less reasonable than the
first.*
    7th. The Retzius bands are often as distinctly marked in forming
as in mature teeth, and in teeth which have been kept constantly
 moist as they are in dried specimens.              The enamel rods are often
seen to pass without break across several of these bands.                  The bands
are principally due to a deposit of pigment, and not to imprisoned
air or gas as claimed by von Ebner.

 however, because the two surfaces which coalesce are first healed by
 cork-tissue ; in animals they remain granulating till brought
 together.

   1. It is well known that if a rigid body, whose principal moments
of inertia are A, A, C, be set rotating about its axis of symmetry and
then be subjected to a slight disturbance, it will execute oscillations
about its mean position, in consequence of which the axis of rotation
will undergo periodic displacements relatively to the body in a period
which bears to the period of rotation the ratio A : C — A. The object
of the present investigation is to determine to what extent this
period will be modified if the body, instead of being perfectly rigid,
is capable of elastic deformations.
   The analysis is confined to the case of a homogeneous spheroid of
revolution composed of isotropic, incompressible, gravitating material,
while for further simplicity the body is supposed to be free from
strain in its interior when rotating uniformly.      If we refer to a set of
rectangular axes rotating with uniform angular velocity w about the
axis of t, the rigorous differential equations for the vibrations of such
a body are

Hence, the effect of elastic distortion      is to prolong the period in the
ratio l + e'/e: 1. Taking a spheroid of the same size and mean density
as the Earth rotating in a sidereal day, we find that the period is
extended from 232 days to 335 days if the rigidity be that of steel.
Assuming that in the case of the actual Earth the effects of hetero
geneity are to still further prolong the period in the ratio 305 : 232,
we find for the period of oscillation of the Earth, supposed of the
rigidity of steel, 444) days.
    Now, observation* indicates that the earth is undergoing such an
oscillation as we have been discussing in a period of 427 days instead
of the period of 305 days indicated by theory on the assumption that
the motion would take place sensibly in the same manner as if the
earth were rigid.      We see now that the divergence between theory
and observation can be explained by taking into account the elastic
distortions of the solid parts of the earth, and that the degree of
rigidity required to account for the observed period is slightly in
excess of the rigidity of steel.
    This explanation has been previously offered by Professor New-
 comb,! wn0 has treated the problem by a simple geometrical method.
 The main object in undertaking the present analytical investigation
 was to examine the validity of certain hypotheses made by Newcomb.
 An examination of the type of oscillation indicated by onr analysis
 shows that the procedure adopted by Newcomb is legitimate, but
 that there is a slight error in his assumed law of displacement of the pole
 of figure due to centrifugal force.        Our method has the additional
 advantage of showing the degree of accuracy to which the results
 may be expected to hold good.

190          Dr. E. W. Hobson.           On a Type  of Spherical   [Jan. 16,
known as the differential equation of Legendre's associated functions ;
the degree n, the order m, and the argument p are not, as in the case
of the ordinary system of spherical harmonics, restricted to be real
and such that n and m are integral and // is a proper fraction, hut are
supposed to have unrestricted real or complex values.         The investiga
tion is undertaken with the object of bringing the various types of
harmonics, such as toroidal functions, conal harmonics, &c., under
one general treatment.
    The two particular functions P„m(/i), Q«"'(/t), which satisfy the
above differential equation are first defined in such a manner that
they are uniform over the whole /t-plane, which, however, has a
cross-cut extending along the real axis from ,« = lto/i=— oo.
    The definitions obtained are the following —

where in (/»*— l)im, the phases of p— 1, /t + 1, are both zero when p is
real and greater than unity, and each varies between the values + ir
for various positions of the point p. Precise definitions are given of
the meanings to be attached to the integrands. The path of integra
tion in the case of P„m(p) consists of a loop described in the positive
direction round the point t = p, followed by one in the positive
 direction round the point t = 1, then a loop in the negative direction
 round the point t = p, and finally a loop in the negative direction
 round the point t = 1, the whole forming a closed path, i.e., one for
 which the integrand attains its initial value after a complete descrip
 tion. In the case of Q»w(/t) only two loops are required to form the
  closed path, one described positively round t = — 1, followed by one
 described negatively round ( = +1. These definitions are so chosen
 that in the case of real integral values of n and in, the functions
 coincide with the ordinary well-known Legendre's associated functions.
     From these definitions the following representations of the functions
 by series are deduced —

         Part I." By Major P. A. MacMahon, R.A„ F.R.S.
         Received December 31, 1895.
                                     (Abstract.)
     The memoir       here presented is a natural sequel to my memoirs of
1891,       1893, and 1894, published in         extenso in the
                                                                   '

Transactions.' In fundamental idea it is graphical, resting, on the
one hand, upon the method of the memoir on the " Compositions of
Numbers," of 1893, and, on the other, upon Sylvester's graphical
method, set forth in his " Constructive Theory of Partitions," of
 1882, published in vol. 5 of the ' American Journal of Mathematics.'
     The memoir is divided into four sections. In § 1 I give new
notions concerning the partitions of ordinary unipartite numbers,
and show that the theory of the separations of a partition necessitates
 the consideration of the partitions of multipartite numbers. The two
 theories proceed in parallel paths. One-to-one correspondence can
 be established at any point.
      In § 2 I am engaged with the graphical representation of unipar
 tite partitions. The graph that, in the memoir of 1893, was employed
 to denote a principal composition of a bipartite number is shown to
  be the graph also of a unipartite partition.           A new theory of uni
 partite partitions is evolved with algebraical developments in cor
  respondence.
               I
      In § 3 investigate a similar correspondence between the composi
  tions of tripartite numbers and certain regularised partitions of
  bipartite numbers. The method is of general application, and indi
  cates a one-to-one correspondence           between the compositions of
  tu+i-partite numbers and certain regularised partitions of m-partite
  numbers.
                I
      In § 4 take up the question of the graphical representation of
  completely regularised multipartite numbers.             I  follow Sylvester,
  proceeding from two to three dimensions.                 Whereas Sylvester
  employed nodes in a two-dimensional corner, I employ nodes piled
   up in a three-dimensional corner.           Sylvester obtains a two-fold
  correspondence from the permutations of his axes x, y.                I obtain a
   six-fold correspondence      from   the  permutations    of  the    three  axes
  z, y, t.      Even Sylvester's two-dimensional graphs permit of six
   interpretations when viewed from the three-dimensional standpoint.
       I strive to determine the number of graphs appertaining to a given
   number of nodes, the numbers of nodes along the three axes being
    restricted in any given manner.
       There is no difficulty in forming a generating function which solves

 the problem. This function, as formed, is redundant (or, as Sylvester-
 would say, " crude "), as containing terms which do not appertain to
 the enumeration, and it has been a principal object to obtain condensed
 or reduced generating functions.               It was not difficult to conjecture
 that if the graphs have not more than two layers of nodes (i.e., not
 more than two nodes along the axis of z, taken to be perpendicular to
 the plane of the paper), but be otherwise unrestricted, the reduced
 generating function is —
       (l-x)-1 (l-x-)-* (l-x3)-* (l-x*)-*                   (1-.Z5)-3....     ad inf.
    Failure to establish this happily led me to send the corresponding
 crude generating function to Professor Forsyth.                      He fnrnished an
 ingenious solution, which is on the point of appearing in the Pro
                                                                                   '
 ceedings    of the London Mathematical Society.'
    Subsequent to this       I obtained a proof, of quite a different character
 and without reference to the crude form, of the same theorem which
 will be found in this section.
   Conjecturally, the G.F.'s, when the layers are restricted in number
to 3, 4, ..., Ac., are —
     (]-*)-'     (1— »i)-*{(l—      «•) (1-a4)           ad inf.}~3,
     (l-a)-1     (l--.!?)-* (l-x3)-3 {(l-x1)         (l-*5)....      ad inf.}-*, &c.,
and when the graphs are quite unrestricted                —
      (l-^)~1 (l-^)~! (l-*3)~1 (I-*')~'-              • " ' (I-.*5)~5         ad inf.
   Finally, a conjecture is made as to the form when the graphs are
restrioted in all these dimensions.
   These conjectures are slowly being transformed into truths, and                    I
trust to present them as such to the Royal Society as Part 2 of this

method of Cavendish had not been reached, although a preliminary
result (19'7) obtained from a mixture of argon and oxygen* went far
to show that the densities of the gases prepared by the two methods
were the same. In order further to test the identity of the gases, it
was thought desirable to pursue the question of density ; and I deter
mined, as the event proved, somewhat rashly, to attempt large scale
weighings of pure argon with the globe of 1800 c.c. capacity
employed in former weighings of gasesf which could be obtained in
quantity.
     The accumulation of the 3 litres of argon, required for convenient
working, involved         the absorption of some       300 litres of nitrogen, or
about 800 litres of the mixture with oxygen. This was effected at
the Royal Institution with the apparatus already described,                   J and
 which is capable of absorbing the mixture at the rate of about
 7 litres per hour. The operations extended themselves over nearly
 three weeks, after which the residual gases amounting to about
 10 litres, still containing oxygen with a considerable quantity of
 nitrogen, were removed to the country and transferred to a special
 apparatus where it could be prepared for weighing.
     For this purpose the purifying vessel had to be arranged some
 what differently from that employed in the preliminary absorption
 of nitrogen. When the gas is withdrawn for weighing, the space left
 vacant must be filled up with liquid, and afterwards when the gas is
 brought back for repurification, the liquid must be removed. In
 order to effect this, the working vessel (Fig. 7)§ communicates by
 means of a siphon with a 10-litre
                                               " aspirating bottle," the ends of
  the siphon being situated in both cases near the bottom of the liquid.
  In this way the alkaline solution may be made to pass backwards
 and forwards, in correspondence with the desired displacements of
 gas-
     There is, however, one objection to this arrangement which requires
  to be met.     If the reserve alkali in the aspirating bottle were allowed
  to come into contact with air, it would inevitably dissolve nitrogen,
  and- this nitrogen would be partially liberated again in the working
  vessel, and so render impossible a complete elimination of that gas
  from the mixture of argon and oxygen.                  By means of two more
  aspirating bottles an atmosphere of oxygen was maintained in the
  first bottle, and the outermost bottle, connected with the second by a
  rubber hose, gave the necessary control over the pressure.
     Five glass tubes in all were carried through the large rubber cork
  by which the neck of the working vessel was closed.                Two of these

convey the electrodes : one is the siphon for the supply of alkali,
while the fourth and fifth are for the withdrawal and introduction of
the gas, the former being bent up internally, so as to allow almost
the whole of the gaseous contents to be removed.               The fifth tube, by
which the gas is        returned,     communicates    with  the  fall-tube of the
Topler pump, provision being made for the overflow of mercury. In
this way the gas, after weighing, could be returned to the working
vessel at the same time that the globe was exhausted. It would be
tedious to describe in detail the minor arrangements. Advantage
was frequently taken of the fact that oxygen could always be added
with impunity, its presence in the working vessel being a necessity
in any case.
    When the nitrogen had been so far removed that it was thought
desirable to execute a weighiug, the gas on its way to the globe had
to be freed from oxygen and moisture. The purifying tubes contained
copper and copper oxide maintained at a red heat, caustic soda, and
 phosphoric anhydride.           In all other respects the arrangements were
as described in the memoir on the densities of the principal gases,*
the weighing globe being filled at 0°, and at the pressure of the
manometer gauge.
    The process of purification with the means at my command proved
to be extremely slow. The gas contained more nitrogen than had
been expected, and the contraction went on from day to day until                   I
almost despaired of reaching a conclusion.             But at last the visible
contraction ceased, and soon afterwards the yellow line of nitrogen
disappeared from the spectrum of the jar discharge.f                 After a little
more sparking, a satisfactory weighing was obtained on May 22,
1895 ; but, in attempting to repeat, a breakage occurred, by which a
litre of air entered, and the whole process of purification had to be
re-commenced.        The object in view was to effect, if possible, a series
of weighings with intermediate sparkings, so as to obtain evidence
that the purification had really reached a limit.            The second attempt
was scarcely more successful, another accident occurring when two
weighings only had been completed. Ultimately a series of four
weighings were successfully executed, from which a satisfactory con
clusion can be arrived at.

    The results     here   recorded    are    derived      from   the comparison of
the weighings      of the globe     " full " with     the mean of the preceding
 and following                   " empty," and

 errors of the      weights and for the shrinkage of the globe when
exhausted, as explained in former papers. In the last series, the
experiment of June 13 gave a result already known to be too low.
The gas was accordingly sparked for fourteen hours more. Between
the weighings of June 18 and June 25 there was nine hours' spark
ing, and between thosa of June 25 and July 2 about eight hours'
sparking. The mean of the last three, viz., 3'2746, is taken as the
definitive result, and it is immediately comparable with 26276, the
 weight under similar circumstances of oxygen.* If we take Oa = 16,
 we obtain for argon

    The conclusion from the spectroscopic evidence that the gases
isolated from the atmosphere by magnesium and by oxygen are
essentially the same is thus confirmed.
                     The Refractivity of Argon and Helium.
    The refractivity of argon was next investigated, in the hope that
it  might throw some light upon the character of the gas. For this
purpose absolute measurements              were not required. It sufficed to
compare     the  pressures necessary in two columns of air and argon of
equal lengths, in order to balance the retardations undergone by
light in traversing them.
    The arrangement was a modification of one investigated by
 Fraunhofer, depending upon the interference of light transmitted
through two parallel vertical slits placed in front of the object
glass of a telescope.        If there be only one slit, and if the original
source,  either   a  distant  point or a vertical line of light, be in focus,
 the field is of a certain width, due to " diffraction," and inversely
as the width of the slit.         If there be two equal parallel slits whose
 distance apart is a considerable multiple of the width of either, the

 the slits. If from any cause one of the portions of light be retarded
 relatively to the other, the bands are displaced in the usual manner,
 and can be brought back to the original position only by abolishing
 the relative retardation.
     When the object is merely to see the interference bands in full per
 fection, the use of a telescope is not required.             The function of the
 telescope    is  really  to    magnify  the  slit  system,*   and this is necessary
 when, as here, it is desired to operate separately upon the two por
 tions of light.        The apparatus           is,
                                                however, extremely simple, the
 principal objection to     it    being the high magnifying power required,
 leading under ordinary arrangements to a great attenuation of light.
I   have found that this objection may be almost entirely overcome by
 the substitution of cylindrical lenses, magnifying in the horizontal
 direction only, for the spherical lenses of ordinary eye-pieces.                  For
 many purposes a single lens suffices, but                 must be of high power.

 In the measurements about to be described most of the magnifying
 was done by a lens of home manufacture.                 It consisted simply of a
round rod, about           in.
                             (4    mm.) in diameter, cut by Mr. Gordon from

                         f        This  could be used alone; but as at first it
was thought necessary to have a web, serving as a fixed mark to
which the bands could be referred, the rod was treated as the object-
glass of a compound cylindrical microscope, the eye-piece being a
commercial cylindrical lens of                in. (31 mm.) focus. Both lenses
                                                1^
were mounted on adjustable stands, so that the cylindrical axes could
be made accurately vertical, or, rather, accurately parallel to the
length of the original slit. The light from an ordinary paraffin lamp
now sufficed, although the magnification was such as to allow the
error of setting to be less than 1/20 of a band interval.                       It             is
to be remembered that with this arrangement the various parts of
the length of a band correspond, not to the various parts of the
original slit, but rather to the various parts of the object-glass. This
departure from the operation of a spherical eye-piece                an advantage,

inasmuch as optical           defects show   themselves     by deformation of the

 short length of stout rubber tubing G, to which was applied a
 squeezer H.     The object of this attachment was to cause a rise of
mercury in both limbs immediately before a reading, and thus to
avoid the capillary errors that would otherwise have entered.               A
similar pipette and manometer wero connected with the air tube B.
In order to be able, if desired, to follow with the eye a particular
band during the changes of pressure (effected by small steps and
alternately in the two tubes), diminutive windlasses were provided by
which the motions of the reservoirs (B) could be made smooth and
slow. In this way all doubt was obviated as to the identity of a
band ; but after a little experience the precaution was found to be
unnecessary.
   The manner of experimenting will now be evident. By adjustment
of pressures the centre of the middle band was brought to a definite
position, determined by the web or otherwise, and the pressures were
measured.     Both pressures were then altered and adjusted until the
band was brought back precisely to its original position.          The ratio
of the changes    of pressure    is the   inverse ratio of the refractivities
(p— l) of the gases.       The process may be repeated backwards and
forwards any number of times, so as to eliminate in great degree
errors of the settings and of the pressure readings.
   During these observations a curious effect was noticed, made
possible by the independent action of the parts of the object-sfhiss
situated at various levels, as already referred to. When the bands
were stationary, they appeared straight, or nearly so, but when in
motion, owing to changes of pressure, they became curved, even in
passing the fiducial position, and always in such a manner that
the ends led.    The explanation is readily seen to depend upon the
temporary changes of temperature which accompany compression or
rarefaction.    The full effect of a compression, for example, would
not be attained until the gas had cooled back to its normal tempera
ture, and this recovery of temperature would occur more quickly at
the top and bottom, where the gas is in proximity to the metal, than
in the central part of the tube.
    The success of the measures evidently requires that there should
be no apparent movement of the bands apart from real retardations
in the tubes. As the apparatus was at first arranged, this condition
 was insufficiently satisfied.    Although all the parts were carried upon
 the walls of the room, frequent and somewhat sudden displacements
 of the bands relatively to the web were seen to occur, probably in
 consequence of the use of wood in some of the supports.          The obser
 vations could easily be arranged      in  such a manner that no systematic
 error could thence enter, but the agreement of individual measures
 was impaired.     Subsequently a remedy was found in the use of a
 second sysiein of bands, formed by light which passed just above the

1896.J       On some Physical Properties    of Argon and Helium.       205
tubes, to which, instead of to the web, the movable bands were referred.
The coincidence of the two systems could be observed with accuracy,
and was found to be maintained in spite of movements of both rela
tively to the web.
     In  the comparisons of argon and air (with nearly the same re-
fractivities) the changes of pressure employed were about 8 in.
 (20 cm.), being deductions from the atmospheric pressure.         In one
observation of July 26, the numbers, representing suctions in inches
of mercury, stood

 signifying that 8'53 in. of argon balanced 8'19 in. of dry air. Four
 sets, during which the air and argon (from the globe ns last filled for
 weighing) were changed, taken on July 17, 18, 19, 26. gave respec
 tively for the final ratio 0-9G2, 0-961, 0961, 0960, or as the mean

                       Refractivity of air
      The evidence from the refraetivities,   as well as from the weights,
  is very unfavourable to the view that argon is an allotropic form of
  nitrogen such as would be denoted by N3.
      The above measurements, having been made with lamp-light, refer
  to the most luminous region of the spectrum, say in the neighbourhood
  of D.     But since no change in the appearance of the bands at the
  two settings could be detected, the inference is that the dispersions
  of the two gases are approximately the same, so that the above ratio
  would not be much changed, even if another part of the spectrum
  were chosen.     It may be remarked that the displacement actually
  compensated in the above experiments amounted to about forty bands,
   each band corresponding to about    \ in. (5 mm.) pressure of mercury.
      Similar comparisons have been made between           air and helium.
  The latter gas, prepared by Professor Ramsay, was brought from
   London by Mr. W. Randall, who further gave valuable assistance in
   the manipulations.    It appeared at once that the refractivity of
  helium was remarkably low, 13 in. pressure of the gas being balanced
   by less than 2 in. pressure of air.   The ratios given by single com
   parisons on Jnly 29 were 0147, 0-146, 0-145, 0146, mean 0146; and
   on July 30 0147, 0'147, 0145, 0145, mean 0146.          The observations
   were not made under ideal conditions, on account of the smallness of

    The viscosity was investigated by the method of passage through
capillary tubes.      The approximate formula has been investigated by
O. Meyer,* on the basis of Stokes' theory for incompressible fluids.

    In the apparatus employed two                 gas pipettes and manometers,
somewhat similar to those shown in fig. 2, were connected                         by a
capillary tube of very small bore and abont 1 metre long.                           The
volume V3 was about 100 c.c., and was caused to pass by a pressure
of a few centimetres of mercury, maintained as uniform as possible
by means of the pipettes. There was a difficulty, almost inherent in
the use of mercury, in securing the right pressures during the first
few seconds of an experiment ; but this was not of much importance
as the whole time t amounted to several minutes. The apparatus was
tested upon hydrogen, and was found to give the received numbers with
sufficient accuracy. The results, referred to dry air, were for helium
0 96; and for argon 1*21, somewhat higher than for oxygen which
at present stands at the head of the list of the principal gases.

    In the original memoir upon argonf results were given of weigh
ings of the residue from the Bath gas after removal of oxygen,
carbonic anhydride, and moisture, from which it appeared that the
proportion of argon was only one-half of that contained in the
residue, after similar treatment, from the atmosphere.                      After the
discovery of helium by Professor Ramsay, the question presented

1896.]       On some Physical Properties   of Argon   and Helium.    207
itself   as  to whether this conclusion might not be disturbed by the
presence in the Bath gas of helium, whose lightness would tend to
compensate the extra density of argon.
    An examination of the gas which had stood in my laboratory more
than a year having shown that it still contained no oxygen, it was
thought worth while to remove the nitrogen so as to determine the
proportion that would refuse oxidation.         For this purpose 200 c.c.
were worked up with oxygen until the volume, free from nitrogen,
was reduced to 8 c.c. On treatment with pyrogallol and alkali the
residue measured 3'3 c.c., representing argon, and helium, if present.
On sparking the residue at atmospheric pressure and examining the
spectrum, it was seen to be mainly that of argon, but with an un
mistakable exhibition of D3. At atmospheric pressure this line
appears very diffuse in a spectroscope of rather high power, but the
place was correct.
    From another sample of residue from the Bath gas, vacuum tubes
were charged by my son, Mr. R. J. Strutt, and some of them showed
 Da sharply denned and precisely coincident with the line of helium
 in a vacuum tube prepared by Professor Ramsay.
    Although the presence of helium in the Bath gas is not doubtful,
 the quantity seems insufficient to explain the low density found in
 October, 1894. In order to reconcile that density with the proportion
 of residue (3.3/200 = 0'Olt!) found in the experiment just described,
 it would be necessary to suppose that the helium amounted to 25 per
 cent, of the whole residue of argon and helium.        Experiment, how
 ever, proved that a mixture of argon aud helium containing 10 per
 cent, of the latter gas showed D3 more plainly than did the Bath
 residue.     It is just possible that some of the helium was lost by
 diffusion during the long interval between the experiments whose
 results are combined in the above estimate.
                                 Buxton Gas.
     Gas  from the Buxton springs, kindly collected for me by Mr. A
 McDongall, was found to contain no appreciable oxygen. The argon
  amounted to about 2 per cent, of the volume.        When its spectrum
  was examined, the presence of D3 was suspected, but the appearance
  was too feeble to allow of a definite statement being made.        The
  proportion of helium is in any case very much lower than in the
  Bath gas.
                   Is Helium Contained in the Atmosphere  ?
     Apart from its independent interest, this question is important in
   connection with the density of atmospheric argon.      Since the spec
   trum of this gas does not show the lino D3, we may probably conclude

that the proportion of helium is less than 3 per cent. ; so that there
would be less than 3 X 10-4 of helium in the atmosphere.                           Tlie
experiment     about   to    be   described       was    an   attempt    to carry the
matter further, and is founded upon the observation by Professor
Ramsay, that the solubility of helium in water is only O007, less
than one-fifth of that which we found for argon.*
   It is evident that if a mixture of helium and argon be dissolved
in water until there is only a small fraction remaining over, the
proportion of helium will be much increased in the residue.                       Two
experiments     have   been     made,     of    which    that  on   October   6, 1895,
was the more elaborate.          About 60 c.c. of argon were shaken for
a long time      with  well     boiled water contained in a large flask.
When the absorption had cea3ed, the residue of 30 c.c. was sparked
with a little oxygen until no nitrogen could be seen in the spec
trum.     It was then treated a second time with boiled water until i's
volume was reduced to l^c.c. With this vacuum tubes were charged
by my son at two different pressures.               In none of them could Ds be
detected ; nor was there any marked difference to be seen between
the spectra of the washed and the unwashed argon. If helium be
present in the atmosphere, it must be in very small quantity, prob
ably much less than a ten- thousandth part.

I. " An Attempt to Determine the Condition in which Helium
       and the Associated Gases exist in Minerals."          By W. A.
       Tilden, D.Sc., F.R.S. Received January, 13, 189(5.
    Argon and probably also helium having, it is supposed, monatomic
molecules,   the chemical inactivity which they have been found to
exhibit cannot be accounted for by the hypothesis usually applied to
the case of nitrogen.    Hence it appears probable that they will not
be found, like nitrogen, to enter into combination with other elements
at such high temperatures as are ordinarily attainable, and experience,
so far, has shown this to be the case. It also appears improbable that
in the minerals from which the mixture of gases containing helium
has been extracted this element exists in a state of ordinary chemical
combination, for on treating the mineral with acids no compound of
helium with hydrogen has yet been observed, and the components of
the minerals are of a kind which is commonly regarded as chemically
saturated.
    I thought it would be interesting to find out if possible whether
the gas evolved on treatment with acids or on the application of heat
was enclosed in cavities or was in the state of so-called " occlusion."
 Supposing no evidence to be forthcoming that the gas was locked up
 in one of these two ways, then some new form of chemical combina
 tion would have to be looked for.
    Some monazite, for which    I  was indebted to the kindness of Pro
 fessor Lockyer, was first examined.        The powdered mineral was
 enclosed in a hard glass bulb, which was sealed on to the Sprengel
 pump and exhausted.       The bulb was then heated in successive
 stages to the temperature of boiling sulphur, 446°.     The first evolu
 tion of gas occurred at 60°, but this consisted of carbon dioxide
 with water vapour, and the temperature being kept constant a vacuum
 was soon re-established.    From 70° to 80° a little more of the same
 gas was evolved, and on raising the temperature successively to 100°,
 115°, 180°, small quantities, nearly equal, of carbon dioxide were

1896.]      Helium and the associated Gases exist in Minerals.      219
given off. From 130° to 140° gas was obtained which for the first
time showed the D3 line, indicating the presence of helinm. About
nine-tenths of this was, however, absorbed by potash. At 160°,
200°, and 235° additional but smaller supplies of gas were obtained,
consisting of carbon dioxide with about one-fourth of its volume of
gas rich in helium. At higher temperatures, up to 446°, smaller
volumes of the same mixture were extracted, a definite and limited
amount of gas being evolved at each point.
    Cleveite behaved in a similar manner. A single well-formed crystal
was used, having only a small flake oF mica attached to one side. The
whole weighed 37 grams. Gas was first evolved rather suddenly at
 110°, and at successive intervals of about 25° it gave off successive
portions of gas containing helium.
    In order to ascertain if the mineral from which the gas had been
removed was capable of re-absorbing it, some massive Swedish
cleveite was powdered and divided about equally between two bulbs,
 A and B, sealed to a small tube filled with soda-lime, and attached to
 the Sprengel pump. Both bulbs were first heated to 100° and
 exhausted ; A was then heated to 160°, and the gas completely
 pnmped out. The bulbs were then shut off from the pump by a tap,
 and B was heated to low redness so as to generate gas within the
 apparatus.     This gas, from which carbon dioxide was absorbed by
 the soda-lime, was left in contact with the mineral in A for about
 nine weeks at summer temperature.        On heating A by an oil bath
 and working the pump no gas could be collected below 160°, the
 temperature to which the mineral had been previously heated.       This
 result seemed to show that cleveite does not re-absorb the helium mix
 ture at the pressure employed in this experiment, which was prob
 ably somewhat less than one atmosphere. The pressure could only
 be guessed at in this form of experiment from observation of the
 capacity of the apparatus and the amount of gas given off by the
 same mineral when heated to redness.
    95 gra.ms or 1*8 c.c. of this sample of cleveite gave at a red heat
  15.6 c.c. of crnde gas, which after contact with potash was reduced
 to 6'3 c.c. The mineral therefore gives 3'5 times its volume of gas
 free from carbon dioxide.
     A second experiment, conducted on a similar principle, but with a
 greater pressure of gas, gave a different result. Two bulbs were used
 as before, but while 10 grams were placed in A as the absorbent,
 40 grams were used in B as the generator.       B was heated by means
 of an air bath to about 400°, and a mercury-air gauge attached
  then showed a pressure of about 2| atmospheres.    A was first heated
  to 165°  and  the gas removed, and the gas  having  been generated in
  B, A was heated to 100° and cooled several times in contact with
  the gas.   The bulb A was then cut ( r, sealed on to the Sprengel

pump, and exhausted completely at air temperature. Heated to 100°
it gave only a tiny bubble of gas, but at 115° evolution of gas com
menced, and continued till the temperature of 150° was reached. The
interval of about 20°, between this and the temperature at which the
mineral was originally extracted, seemed sufficient to prevent sus
picion that the gas now obtained was due to the natural charge, and
had not been re-absorbcd. The gas contained hydrogen, helium, and
nitrogen, and amounted to about 1/25 of the volume of the mineral.
After cooling to the air temperature the bulb was a second time
heated to 150°, but no further evolution of gas occurred. The same
cleveite in its natural state gives, when heated to 17CP, about one-
third of its volume of the helium mixture.
    An experiment was now made with a portion of the mineral which
had been used to generate the gas in the preceding experiment, and
it was found that in contact with the gas at a pressure between 2 anl
3 atmospheres an amount was taken up about equal (1/24 volume) to
that which was absorbed by the mineral which had been heated only
to 170°, but while the gas thus removable below the temperature of
150° contained helium, it also contained carbon dioxide, which seemed
to suggest that helium or one of the other gases by which it is accom
panied is capable of displacing carbon dioxide from cleveite.
   In order to test the effect of greater pressures it was necessary to

1896.]      Helium and the associated Gases exist in Minerals,       221
generate    the gas separately.   It was made by heating cleveite, and
was deprived of carbon dioxide by potash and of water by calcium
chloride.    An apparatus was then arranged consisting of a wide,
vertical glass tube, attached at its lower end to a strong canvas-cased
rubber tube connected with a reservoir of mercury which could be
raised to the ceiling of the laboratory.    The upper end of the glass
tube was drawn out and sealed to a horizontal tube having three
vertical branches, each terminating in a bulb. The horizontal tube

cleveite -which had been heated to 400° circ. in a vacuum ; B con
tained 9 grams (17 c.c.) of the same which had been heated only
to 170° in a vacuum ; and C contained 7-5 grams (0-9 c.c.) of arti
ficial lead uranate which had been heated to redness in a platinum
crucible.    The three bulbs, with their contents, were first heated to
100°, and at that temperature completely exhausted of air.           Gas
was then admitted till the apparatus was filled with it at atmo
spheric pressure.     The horizontal tube was then sealed off by the
blowpipe    between   the bulbs and the pump, and, by raising the
mercury reservoir, a pressure of nearly 7 atmospheres was obtained.
The bulbs were heated by a water bath for three days (18 hours),
and the pressure was maintaiuod during a total of about 96 hours.
Each bulb was then separately cut off, sealed to the Sprengel pump,
and exhausted.
   A, heated in an air bath to about 360°, gave 0'25 c.c. of gas rich in
helium, but containing a little carbon dioxide.        The mineral had
absorbed rather more than one-seventh of its volume.
   B, heated in an oil bath, gave 044 c.c. gas between 120° and 162°.
This also contained much helium, with carbon dioxide.           It corre
sponds to more than one-fourth the volume of the mineral.
    C, heated to 150°, gave 0-24 c.c., and a further quantity, 0'18 c.c.
at 150° to 210°.      This gas, however, consisted almost wholly of
c irbon dioxide with a little air, but showed no trace of helium.
    The mineral clevoite, therefore, appears to be capable of re-absorb
ing helium to an extent which increases with the pressure, and which
is, roughly, proportional to the pressure.     The pressure under which
the original mineral was oharged must have been considerable,
probably amounting to several hundred atmospheres.
   As hydrogen is readily absorbed by certain metals, especially
iron and palladium, it was thought possible that helium would also
be readily taken up by the same.         A piece of thin sheet-iron was,
therefore, carefully polished and heated to low redness in a bulb
sealed to the Sprengel pump    till all gas had apparently been expelled.
The gas extracted from iron gave no indication of the presence of
helium.     Gas from cleveite, purified from carbon dioxide and dried
as before, was admitted till the pressure amounted to about five-sixths
 of an atmosphere. The iron was heated to redness and cooled in
contact with the gas, the excess of gas was then pumped out, and
the iron heated by a Bunsen flame.         It gave a small quantity of a
gas consisting of hydrogen and carbonic oxide and a little helium.
 Repeating the admission of the gas, heating, &c., the iron gave off
 a second time about one-third of its volume of gas of the same com
position. The yellow D3 line was weak in the spectrum of both these
 products from the iron, although it was very brilliant in the cleveite
 gas to which the metal had been exposed.          It appears, therefore,

1896.]       Helium ami the associated   Gases e.rist in Minerals.      223
that though       iron absorbs   helium,  it absorbs   it less freely than
hydrogen.
    Similar experiments with palladium foil gave a gas consisting
chiefly of hydrogen with small quantities of nitrogen and a carbon
compound, bnt no helium recognisable by the spectroscope.           This, of
course, does not prove that no helium had been absorbed, but it
shows that it is taken up much less readily than hydrogen.
     Being n')w desirous of ascertaining whether a simple silicious
mineral, containing at. most minute quantities of any heavy metal,
would absorb the helium-containing gas from cleveite, I chose a piece
of red Peterhead granite. In order to prepare it for the experiment,
the granite was powdered, placed in a bulb attached to the Spredgel
 pump, and heated gradually by a flame till the glass began to soften.
 Being aware that granite and other rocks commonly contain cavities
 charged with gas, I expected to obtain a considerable quantity of
 carbon dioxide.      I was, however, rather surprised to find that the
 gas given off from this sample of granite contained a large propor
 tion of hydrogen. The following are the details of one experiment : —
 15'2 grams of granite, in volume equal to 5'7 c.c., was heated first by
 a Bunsen flame, and finally by a blowpipe, till the glass of the bulb
 softened. It gave 149 c.c. of gas measured at 17°, which appeared
 to be free from water. This gas consisted of 3"7 c.c. COi and 11-2 c.c.

     No helium could be detected in the original gas nor in the residual
  air left after explosion.
     A secion of this rock was prepared for me by Professor Judd, to
  whom I wish to offer my best thanks, both for the specimen and for
  his valuable assistance.     Under a high power (one-eighth inch) the
  section exhibits myriads of minute, irregularly shaped cavities, in
  some of which liquid is clearly discernible.     This liquid is probably
  carbon dioxide, though, from the minuteness of the cavities, we were
  not able to make any estimation of the critical point of the liquid.
     After this granite had been deprived of gas as completely as
  possible, it was heated and cooled alternately in contact with the
  helium mixture under a pressure of about 7 atmospheres, as already
  described.    The mineral, however, took up none of the gas, for, after
  pumping     out the excess of gas in the cold, the falling mercury con
  tinued to sound sharply, while the temperature of the mineral was
  gradually raised to a red heat.
     From the results of the experiments recorded in this paper, it
  seems that helium exists in the minerals in which it is found in a
  condition comparable with that in which hydrogen is associated

224            Mr. H. E. Durham.        On the Special Action    of   [Jan.   23,
with many metals, and carbonic oxide especially with iron. Whether
this condition is rightly distinguished from ordinary chemical com
bination is a question which admits of debate.          The stability of all
dissociable compouiids is influenced by pressure and by temperature
in the same kind of way as " occlusion,'' which, like ordinary chemical
combination again, is a phenomenon in which the bodies concerned
exercise a power of selection.
   The presence of hydrogen as well as carbon dioxide in granite,
if already observed, is not known to geologists generally.             From
observation on variations in the critical point of carbon dioxide in
minerals ('J. Chem. Soc.,' 1876,       248), Hartley seems to infer that

p. 110, refers to the presence of hydrogen in cavities      ;but at present
1  have no information      as to the evidence upon which this state
ment     is based.    The presence of hydrogen in such a rock as
granite must be attributed to the existence of this gas in large
proportion in the atmosphere in which the rock was crystallised.
Whether this was the primeval atmosphere of the earth before the
hydrogen had escaped or had been oxidised into water, or whether               it
resulted from the local action of water upon unoxidised metals or
other materials in the interior of the earth,          is a question which
may   be of  some  interest to the geologist.    If the  former  hypothesis
were adopted,       would perhaps be difficult to explain the absence
                    it
of helium from the gas included in the rock; and, on the whole,
I  incline to the latter view, as affording the more probable ex
planation.

 tion   deals  with the effects produced upon microbes in vitro by the
 serums    of highly immunised animals, even when extremely dilute.
This     portion   of the enquiry has been carried out mainly in the
Bacteriological Laboratory of Guy's Hospital.
    1. A remarkable series of effects are produced on an emulsion of
actively motile microbes by the addition of minute quantities of potent
kinds of serum.
    2. These effects have been observed with the cholera vibrio, a
variety of other vibrios, the typhoid bacillus, the Bacillus coli com
munis, and the Bacillus pyocyaneus.
    3. It is highly improbable that the phenomena are limited to the
groups and species here named.            Further observation is requisite
npoD    other   motile, as well as  the non-motile bacteria.
    4. The most prominent of the effects thus produced consists of an
immediate aggregation of the bacteria into
                                                   " clumps " ; this is com
bined with loss of motility.            Marked inhibition of growth also
occurs.                                                    .
    5. The formation of clumps can be detected readily by the naked
eye.     Eventually they gravitate to the bottom of the tube containing
them.
    6. A " complete action " is obtained when all the clumps settle
down,    leaving a perfectly clear fluid.    The time required for settling
varies   somewhat with different organisms, as also according to the
amount and potency of the serum used.
    7. The least quantity       of serum which will give a "complete
reaction" in about one hour forms a convenient standard.            A highly
potent serum will react thus in 1 per cent. solution, which is a con
venient unit.
    8. The more intense the action of the serum the more rapid and
the more complete are the changes which ensue.
    9. By means of the intensity of action in varying dilutions, two or
more samples of serum, or of freshly drawn blood, may be gauged
according to their potency.
    10. Normal serum, and the serum obtained by immunisations with
totally unrelated groups of organisms, do not interact upon the unre
lated microbes, so far as present observation shows.
    11. The action of cholera serum upon more or less closely related
vibrios may be " complete " or nil.            A series of gradations in
intensity of reaction has been observed with cholera serum and
vibrios of other species, and vice versa.
    12. The action of such        serum cannot therefore be regarded as
            " it is
"specific     ;       better named special or specialised.
    13. The limit of the absolute value of such serum tests for the
diagnosis of cholera vibrios has yet to be determined.
    14. All the typhoid bacilli from nineteen different sources hitherto

observed    react with typhoid     serum   ; none   of them   react with the
B. coli serum.
    15. Of the B. coli varieties hitherto proved, some do not react with
one sample of B. coli serum.
    16. The agreement in action of the typhoid bacilli points to the use
of the method for diagnostic purposes. Given a young culture and
typhoid serum, diagnosis can be made in a few minutes.
    17. As shown by serum experiment, the variation within the
B. coli group is greater than that of B. typhi races.
    18. By the method described, more delicate changes can be observed
than with such me.th.ods as plate cultivations, and the fallacies thereof
are avoided.
    19. A vibrio and a vibrio        sernm which will give a " complete
           "
reaction in vitro will also give a positive result in " Pfeiffer's reac
tion " (e.g., V. Iwanoffi and V. Berolinensis with cholera serum).
    20. It is not worth while performing Pfeiffer's test unless a
                                                                        " com
plete reaction" has been obtained in vitro.
    21. In the method described, the whole series of changes, if any,
are before the eye the whole time.         In Pfeiffer's method the changes
can only be seen by removing samples from their hiding place in the
 guinea-pig's peritoneal cavity.        The extent of possible fallacy from
 using the peritoneal fluid of    a  living animal is not yet defined.     Pro
 fessor Pfeift'er himself admits that the animals vary to some extent
 according to their condition of health.

I. " On the Rhythmic Contractility of the Spleen. Preliminary
      Notice."     By E. A. Suhafer, F.R.S., and              13.  Moore.   Re
      ceived January 10, 1896.
         (From the Physiological Laboratory, University College, London.)
    The authors have investigated         the rhythmic contractility of the
spleen, which was discovered by Roy (Jonrn. Physiol., vol. 3), and
the influence of nerves, drugs, and animal extracts upon it. For this
purpose the changes in its volume have been studied by aid of a
specially constructed plethysmograph, so arranged as to afford the
least possible obstruction to the blood-vessels entering and leaving
the hilum.     Under these circumstances, the spleen exhibits evidenco
of responding immediately by alterations in volume to every altera
tion in blood pressure, respiratory and cardiac, and a fortiori to such
greater changes as are produced by compression of the aorta (contrary
 to Roy). This is even manifest when the organ is left connected with
 the rest of the vascular system by one artery and vein only.               The

 2Pi0          On t/ie Rhythmic    Contractility of the Spleen.   [Jan.  30,
 conclusion which Roy arrived at, that the spleen is practically cut off
 from the arterial system, and that its circulation is maintained by
 its own contractions, is thus shown to be incorrect.
    The rhythmic contractions are independent of the central nervons
 R3'stem, for they will proceed after all the nerves passing to the organ
 are severed, and they can also be showu in an excised spleen perfused
 with defibrinated arterial blood.
    They are excited to increased activity by intravenous injection of
certain drugs and animal extracts which act specifically upon the
organ. Prominent amongst these are curare, water extract of supra
 renal, and water extract of brain.         Suprarenal extract causes an
enormous      contraction,  followed   by increased extent of rhythmic
 waves ; curare and brain extract, mainly the latter, without a prelimi
nary contraction. Indifferent fluids, such as normal salt solution, pro
duce in moderate quantity no such effects (contrary to Roy), and the
same is the case with many animal extracts;
    As was shown by Roy, a condition of dyspnoea causes marked con
traction of the spleen.     The authors show that this contraction is of
central origin, for after severance of all nerves to the organ it is
 replaced by a passive dilatation, due to the rise of general blood
 pressure, this being soon followed by an increase in extent of: the
rhythmic contractions. Temporary cessation of the blood flow through
t he organ also has the effect of increasing their extent, probably because
the splenic tissue is thereby deprived of oxygen and rendered tempo
rarily more excitable.
    The splanchnics, both right and left, contain not only nerve fibres
which produce contraction of the spleen (Tarchanoff, Pfliiger's Archie,
vol. 8; Roy, loc. cit.), but also others which cause dilatation of the
organ.
    There is no evidence that the vagi contain any centrifugal fibres
which influence the volume of the spleen (contrary to Roy). Provided
their inhibitory action upon the heart is neutralised by atropine, even
the strongest stimulation of the peripheral end of either cut vagus
produces no direct effect upon the spleen.
    Stimulation of any of the nerve-twigs which accompany the arterial
branches to the spleen causes strong contraction of the whole organ.
The contractions which result from splanchnic stimulation are also
obtained even when there is only a. minute twig left, all other nerves
being severed. There is, therefore, probably a very free nervous com
munication within the organ.
    Evidence has been obtained of th? existence of numerous afferent
(sensory) fibres in the nerves supplying the spleen.

II.   " The Electrical Measurement of Starlight.             Observations
       made at the Observatory of Daramona House, co. West-
       meath, in January, 18%.           Second Report."       By G. M.
       Minchix, M.A., F.R.S., Professor of Mathematics, Cooper's
       Hill College. Received January 23, 18%.
    In the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society,' vol. 58, pp. 142, &c, will
be found the first account of the measurement of stellar radiation by
means of the electromotive force generated by the action of star
light on my photo-electric cells.      The observations were resumed in
the beginning of January, 1896, in Mr. W. E. Wilson's observatory
by the same three observers — namely, Mr. Wilson, Professor Fitz
gerald, and myself.
    Oar appliances were substantially the same as before ; but the
photo-electric cells had in the meantime been rendered markedly
 more sensitive by the prevention of the ascent of the liquid
 (omanthol) into the glass tube containing the aluminium wire, the
 end of which was coated with the selenium layer on which the light
 was received.
    This ascent of the liquid was prevented by simply painting the
 circle of contact of the wire and tube with liquid gelatine, and
 allowing the gelatine ring thus formed to dry. As gelatine is not
 dissolved by cenanthol, the liquid was in this way kept out of contact
 with the aluminium wire, and the result was a great increase in the
 sensitiveness and lasting power of the cell.
     It is to be regretted that out of the fourteen nights at our disposal
 for work, only one proved favourable for observations ; but even on
 this night, we were obliged to omit observations on such bright stars
 as Sirius, Rigel, and Capella, owing to the persistence of haze in the
 atmosphere.
     The aim of our work on this occasion was to measure the candle
 power of the light of each of the stars in Orion and the Great Bear,
 together with that of as many others as spare time would allow us
 to observe.
     As one cell may not be exactly the same in sensitiveness as
 another, I have set down in the following table the value of the light
 of each star in terms of that of a standard candle held at a distance
 of 10 ft. from the sensitive surface in the cell ; but the value of the
 lifht in volts is easily deduced from the data.
     The electrometer employed was that previously used and de
  scribed ; and it continued to give with remarkable constancy a
  deflection of 630 mm. on a scale distant 7 ft. from the mirror for one
  Leclanche cell, or, say, 432 mm. for 1 volt.

     One observation was attempted for Rigel ; but when a deflection
of 8 mm. had been attained, the light was cut off by clouds, and no
further opportunity occurred.
    With regard to the last column in this table, be it understood that
it gives the ratio of the E.M.F. produced by the light of the star as con
centrated     in a  telescope    of   2 ft. aperture to the    E.M.F. produced     by the
light of the candle falling directly on the cell from a distance of 10 ft.
    In order to determine the candle value of any star, we must, of
course, take into account the area              of the telescope aperture, the area
of the sensitive selenium surface in the cell, the distance of the star
from the earth, and the distance of the candle from the cell.
    Thus, if I = intrinsic brightness of a star (i.e., the total amouut
of energy radiated in all directions by the star per unit time)

     We cannot help being struck by the enormous power of Betelgeuse
 as indicated in the table.        The deflection observed was the mean of
Jive, all very fairly close.       Now the only parallax recorded for this
 star, so far as I can ascertain, is a negative one ! The star is, there
 fore, immeasurably distant, and yet the E.M.F. of its light is very
 great;     hence  it must  be possessed of tremendous energy.
     We hope that our next observations will be taken with still better
 appliances, as Mr. Wilson has suggested a great improvement in the
 call-carrying apparatus, which will enable us to see simply and with
  certainty when the light of the star is falling exactly on the sensitive
  selenium surface.

         Phylloporphyrin       and    Hsematoporphyrin       : a Comparison."
         By Edward Schunck, F.R.S., and Leon Marchlewski,
         Ph.D. Received January 23, 1896.
      In  the memoir on the Chemistry of Chlorophyll immediately pre-
-  ceding this one, we described a derivative of chlorophyll, the analysis
   of which, confirmed by that of its zinc salt, led to the formula
   CmH^NiO,.       This substance being probably in the main identical
   with the phylloporphyrin of previous observers, we saw no reason to
   give it another name.
      Recent investigations of the colouring matter of blood, more espe
   cially that of Nencki and Sieber, have shown that to the anhydride
   of haematoporphyrin, a derivative          of haemoglobin,     the formula
   CajHMNiOi is to be ascribed.         This  formula differs from that of
   phylloporphyrin simply by three atoms more of 0. But the resem
   blance between the two substances is not confined to the approxima
   tion of their formulae ; it extends also to several of their physical
   properties, such as the colour of their solutions, but more especially
   the appearance of these solutions before the spectroscope, which is
   so nearly alike, so far as the absorption spectra are concerned, that not
   knowing their wide difference in other respects we might be inclined
   to consider them as identical. That the two series of derivatives, that
   of chlorophyll and that of haemoglobin, each playing an important
   part in the vegetable and animal organism respectively, should so
   nearly touch at one point is certainly a remarkable circumstance. In
       V0L. LIX.                                                        R

another respect the two series seem to be related. It is well known
that the colouring matter of blood is a derivative of pyrrol.                      This
appears to be the case with chlorophyll also, as the following experi
ment tends to show.
   When phyllotaonin or one of its ethers is heated with zinc dust, a
small quantity of distillate is obtained which smells strongly of pyrrol,
and which, on treatment with hydrochloric acid, yields a colouring
matter having the properties of pyrrol-red.                Furthermore, when dry
phyllotaonin      is heated,   and    the  vapour  given   off is passed over a fir-
wood splinter moistened with hydrochloric acid, the latter acquires
an intense carmine colour, a reaction peculiar to pyrrol.
   The haematoporphyrin employed by us was obtained according to
the method described by Nencki and Sieber.*                   Haeniin derived from
blood was converted into hrematoporphyrin by solution in glacial
acetic acid and treatment with hydrobromic acid ; it was purified by
means of its crystallised chlorhydrate.
   On comparing the properties of the hffimatoporphyrin so obtained
with those of phylloporphyrin, it was found that the two substances
bore a strong resemblance to one another in some respects, and differed
in others. The solutions of hffimatoporphyrin in neutral solvents
such as alcohol and ether show the same colour and fluorescence
as those of phylloporphyrin.              On the addition of acids they turn
crimson,    but  with    alkalis  they   lose their brilliant colour and become
brownish-red.        As regards their behaviour to alkalis, the two sub
stances differ considerably, phylloporphyrin               being almost insoluble
in aqueous alkalis, while hffimatoporphyrin dissolves easily therein.
The zinc salt of phylloporphyrin crystallises in brilliant red needles,
while that of haeinatoporphyrin cannot be made to crystallise. Again,
while an ethereal solution of phylloporphyrin yields crystals on evapo
ration, that of hsematoporphyrin gives only an amorphous mass.                       As
regards   the   formulae    of  the  two   substances,  it  may  be   stated,   in addi
tion to what has been said above, that if that of phylloporphyrin
 be halved and one H be added, we get CieH^NiO, which differs from
 that of hffimatoporphyrin, CuHmNiOs, by 20 less. The formula
 CieUisNiO requires numbers not differing very widely from those
found by analysis.
   The absorption spectra of the two substances exhibit a remarkable
resemblance; one may almost wiy they are identical. The absorption
 spectrum of an ethereal solution of phylloporphyrin was shown in
 the preceding memoir, and need not therefore be again described.
 That of hffimatoporphyrin in neutral solutions is precisely the same,
 so far as regards the number and relative intensity of the bands, but
 the latter are slightly nearer the red end than in the case of phyl'o-
porphyrin.       The spectrum of hffimatoporphyrin in acid solutions has

  been variously described.        On examining a concentrated solution of
  haernatoporpbyrin in dilute hydrochloric acid, two very dark bands
  are seen separated by an extremely narrow space, the one nearest the
  blue end having one edge shaded off. On gradual dilution, the two
  bands become narrower, and between them there then appears a third
  band which, with a narrow slit, remains visible even on great dilu
  tion. The same phenomena are seen in the case of phylloporphyrin.
  Lastly, the zinc salt of ha=matoporphyrin           in solution shows two ab
  sorption bands, just as does that of pty-llnporphyrin.           The facts just
  described point, notwithstanding          the  differences observed, to some
  near relationship between the two bodies.             They suggest the possi
  bility of our being able to convert one into the other, or at least of
  obtaining by appropriate treatment some derivative common to both,
  such as the product described by Nencki and Sieber, due to the action
  of nitric acid on halmatoporphyrin.         The difficulty found in obtaining
  sufficiently large quantities of the two substances in a state of purity
  constitutes a formidable obstacle to the success of any such attempts.
     We beg, in conclusion, to thank Professor Nencki for a specimen
  of hffimatoporphyrin hydrochloride which he kindly presented to ns.

" An Enquiry         into the Nature of the Vesicating Constituent of
       Croton Oil." By Wyndham R. Dunstan, M.A., F.R.S., and
       LUCY Everest Boole, F.I.C., Lecturer on Chemistry in the
       London School of Medicine for Women. Received June 5,
       — Read June 20, 1895.
   The nature of the vesicating, or more strictly the pustule- producing,
constituent of croton oil is a long out-standing problem in chemical
pharmacology.          Many attempts have been made to disentangle from
the complicated mixture of fatty acids and glycerides expressed from
the seeds of Croton tiijlium, known as croton oil, a single substance
exhibiting its remarkable power of raising pustules on the skin.
The conclusion first arrived at by Pelletier and Caventou that the
vesicating constituent is a volatile acid was afterwards proved to be
incorrect.       The early experiments of Nimmo and of Warington
showed that alcohol is able approximately to separate the oil into two
parts, that which dissolves containing nearly the whole of the vesi
cating constituent.           The systematic investigation, of which an
extensive and somewhat involved account was published by Bueh-
heim* in the year 1857, confirmed and extended these observations.
It was then shown that the small proportion of croton oil which
may be dissolved by repeated extraction with alcohol (85 per cent.)
contains nearly the whole of the vesicating constituent.                   But the
bland oil which remains undissolved still retains the purgative power
of the original substance.             When the solution of the vesicating
portion    is  mixed    with   aqueous ammonia and lead oxy-acetate, the
vesicating constituent remains in solution, and the precipitate con
tains only the lead salts of fatty acids. The vesicating oil may be
saponified by alkalis the resulting soap still retaining the vesicating
property which is also exhibited by the magnesium, barium and had
salts prepared from the soap. A partial purification of the vesicating
substance may be effected by extracting the lead salt with ether which
dissolves an inactive lead salt (lead oleate), but leaves a lead salt pos
sessing powerful vesicating properties and furnishing, when decom
posed with hydrochloric acid, an oily acid exhibiting the same property.
The ethyl salt, prepared in the usual way from this acid, is however
not vesicating, neither is the acid regenerated from it. From these
results Buchheim concluded that the vesicating property of croton
oil is due either to a peculiar non-volatile acid which he named
crotonoleic acid, or perhaps to a hydrolytic product of this acid. On
the other hand he suggests that the vesicating property may belong

  to some other constituent which is present as an impurity in this
  acid, and cannot he separated from it. In this paper Buchheim does
  not decide in favour of either of these hypotheses, but on the whole
  leans towards the last supposition.           A year later, the subject was
  investigated by Schlippe,* who was apparently not familiar with
  Buchheim's observations.         Schlippe showed that the vesicating con
  stituent, obtained by solution of the croton oil in strong alcohol, was
  destroyed by heating it with alkalis.          He concluded that it is not an
  acid, but a polyhydric alcohol of the formula Ci3HuC^ ; and he
  proposed for it the name of crotonol.         In 1873 Buchheimf published
  an account of further work on the vesicating constituent.                   Repeat
  ing the experiments of Schlippe, he came to the conclusion that this
  observer was mistaken in considering crotonol as the active consti
  tuent of the oil. Buchheim maintains that his new experiments
  have conclusively proved that the vesicating principle is an acid,
  crotonoleic acid.     This substance he isolated in the following manner :
  croton. oil was shaken several times with alcoholic ammonia, the
  upper alcoholic layer, which contains the vesicating constituent,
  being each time removed from the insoluble oil below.                The alcoholic
  solution was mixed with an aqueous solution of barium chloride, and
  warmed. The barium salt thus formed whs filtered off, washed and
  dried. It was then repeatedly extracted with ether, which dissolves
  the barium salt of oleic and crotonoleic acids, but leaves the barium
   salts of other fatty acids (stearic, palmitic, &c.) undissolved.              The
   ethereal solution of the barium salts is decomposed by shaking it
   with dilute hydrochloric acid.        The ether, having been washed with
   water, is distilled and the oleic and crotonoleic acids are then left in
   the form of an oil. This oil is dissolved in alcoholic ammonia, and
   the liquid fractionally precipitated with a solution of barium chlo
   ride, the last precipitate being subjected to a repetition of the
   process until finally a barium salt having a constant composition is
   obtained.    By this means the less soluble barium oleate may be sepa
   rated  from  the more soluble barium crotonoleate. The acid regene
   rated from the barium salt is an oil, which Buchheim considered to
   be the same as Schlippe's crotonol.
      Crotonolpic acid is slowly decomposed when heated with alkalis or
   strong acids, losing its vesicating property.           Buchheim did not pre
   pare  the  acid pure enough      to  admit   of  ultimate    analysis, but from
   its behaviour he concludes that crotonoleic acid is closely related to
   the ricinoleic acid of castor oil. Its glyceride does not vesicate ;
   and, according to Buchheim, croton oil contains the glyceride as well
   as the free acid, so that, if the bland oil remaining after the removal

            Nature of the Vesicating Constituent of Croton Oil.
of    the crotonoleic acid is saponified, the vesicating property is fonnd
in    the acids regenerated from the soap.
     In 1883 H. Senier,* apparently unaware of previons researches on
the subject, including those of Buchheim, published an accouut of
observations which led him to conclusions similar in some respects
to those previously arrived at by Buchheim.                       Senier found that
strong alcohol separates croton oil into two parts: a small part
which dissolves, carrying with it the whole of the vesicating consti
tuent, and the main part which does not dissolve, but retains the
purgative power, although it has lost the vesicating property. The
vesicating constituent is not a free acid since it is not removed from
croton oil by agitation with aqueous sodium carbonate.                     When the
soluble oil is saponified with potash the vesicating property is no
 longer exhibited by the soap ; but the acid regenerated from the soap
 vesicates powerfully.          By a process of fractional saponification,
 followed by fi actional precipitation of the fatty acids, Senier con
 cluded that the vesicating constituent is a non-volalile fatty acid,
 closely resembling oleic acid.           The glyceride of this acid is less
 readily   saponifiable   than   the other     glycerides present in croton oil;
 and, similarly, the acid is regenerated first when the soaps are
 decomposed, being thrown out with the acids of lowest melting
 point.
     In 1890, the question as to the nature of the vesicating constituent
  was reinvestigated by Hirscheydt.f working in Professor Kobert's
 laboratory at Dorpat.         It is pointed out, in his voluminous paper,
 that alcohol fails to effect a sharp separation of the vesicating from
 the non- vesicating portion of croton oil ; that different specimens
 vary in their solubility in alcohol ; and that, although the vesicating
 constituent is far more soluble, yet, if sufficient alcohol be used, the
 whole of the oil will gradually pass into solution. A repetition of
  Buchheim's experiments confirmed his conclusion that a non-volatile
  fatty acid is the cause of the vesicating property ; and for this acid it
  was proposed to retain the name of " crotonoleic acid," originally
  suggested by Buchheim.          By purifying the barium salt, the acid was
  ultimately obtained in a purer condition than it had been produced
  by Buchheim.      It was not submitted to ultimate analysis; but since
  its barium salt, prepared in the pure state by fractionally precipi
  tating the sodinm salt with barium chloride, contained loss barium
  than barium oleate, it is judged to have a higher molecular weight
  than oleic acid. The acid is a brown oil at the ordinary temperature,
  and is very unstable, especially when in contact with alkalis, which,
  if heated with it, slowly destroy its vesicating power.

    '    is suggested by Hirscbeydt : — The part of the croton oil which is
         readily soluble in strong alcohol is heated on the water bath with a
         hot saturated solution of barium hydroxide, until saponification is
         complete.    The barium soap thus formed is well washed with water,
         until the soluble barium salts (acetate, butyrate, tiglate, &c.) are
         removed, and it is then dried by warming it in a vacuum. The dried
         mass is next repeatedly extracted with ether, which dissolves the
         barium salts of oleic and crotonoleic acids, but not those of palmitic,
         stearic and other solid fatty acids.
            In order to separate the barium crotonoleate from the barium
        oleate which accompanies it in the residue left on the evaporation of
         ethereal solution, the mixture is extracted with cold absolute alcohol,
         which dissolves only the crotonoleate.    The barium crotonoleate thus
        obtained is decomposed by the addition of dilute sulphuric acid, and
        the crotonoleic acid separated by extracting the mixture with ether
        in the usual manner.
            By this means Hirscheydt claims to have produced crotonoleic acid
        in a purer and more active condition than that in which it was ob
        tained by Buehheim.       He points out, however, that the new process
        is not a wholly satisfactory one for the production of the acid, since
        some is inevitably decomposed by the barium hydroxide, even if every
        precaution is taken to avoid over-heating the mixture during saponi
        fication.
            Crotonoleic acid thus prepared has been employed medicinally,
        and is now an article of commerce.
            It will be seen from the foregoing brief sketch of previous experi
        ments on the nature of the vesicating constituent of croton oil that,
        although conflicting accounts have been given, the evidence which
        has been so far accumulated goes to prove that the active substance
        is the glyceride of an acid to which the name of crotonoleic acid is
        given, the acid, as well ns its salts, having vesicating properties.    It
        is, however, very doubtful, from the nature of the processes which
        have been employed to isolate the compound, and from the descrip
        tion of its properties, whether it is a single substance.     It appeared
        to us important to attempt to obtain the pure compound and then to
        ascertain precisely its chemical constitution, so that we might be able
        to understand the kind of structure which is associated with the
        vesicating property, especially since no other fatty acid of known
        constitution exhibits this peculiarity.

            The crotonoleic acid used in these experiments was either prepared
        by ourselves from croton oil, following the Dorpat directions given
        above, or it was procured from Merck of Darmstadt, who prepares

instance the substance was distilled with steam but nothing passed
over, and the oil was apparently unchanged. Distillation under the
ordinary pressure produced entire decomposition. Distillation under
reduced pressure gave no better results. A liquid began to distil
near 200° C. (50 mm.), but this was evidently a product of decom
position, the quantity of which increased as the temperature rose
gradually to 250° C. None of the fractions exhibited vesicating power,
and the residue was also inactive.
     Fractional precipitation of the lead salt of the acid was next
 adopted, in order to ascertain whether the substance was homo
geneous. A solution of lead acetate in alcohol was added to an alcoholic
solution of the crotonoleic acid. Water was then mixed with the
 clear solution, until a permanent turbidity resulted. The oily lead
 salt which soon settled was removed and decomposed with dilute
 hydrochloric acid, and then the free crotonoleic acid was extracted
 with ether. The alcoholic mother liquor was precipitated a second
 time with lead acetate and water, and the acid similarly regenerated
 from the lead salt. Since a third fraction could not be obtained from
 the alcoholic solution, this was decomposed and the acid recovered
 from the dissolved lead salt. Since our object was to ascertain whether
 the original material was homogeneous and consisted entirely of the
 vesicating constituent of croton oil, and as there is no chemical test
 for the presence of the active substance, we were obliged to fall back
 on a physiological method of detecting it and indicating approxi
 mately the extent to which the active substance was contained in
 different specimens of material. The plan adopted was to dissolve
 equal weights of the substances in the same weight of oleic acid, and
 then to apply a single drop of each solution to the arm; the extent
 of the blistering which ensued being carefully noted. This we have
 found to be the only method readily available for gauging approxi
 mately the vesicating power of different specimens.     When the three
 specimens, fractionated from the original crotonoleic acid, were tested
 in this manner, the first was found to be quite inactive, the second to
 be nearly inactive, whilst the third and smallest fraction proved to
 be a violent vesicant, far exceeding in power the original crotonoleic
 acid. A number of these fractionation experiments were performed,
 always with the same result, thus conclusively proving that croton
 oleic acid is a mixture for the most part composed of non- vesicating
 material.    When the original substance is fractionally precipitated
 with lead acetate the non- vesicating constituents are precipitated
 first, leaving nearly all the active material in solution. It therefore
 seemed probable that by taking advantage of this difference in the
 solubility of the lead salt in dilute alcohol we might be able to isolate

  /   the pure active substance.      Starting with crotonoleic acid, and with
           last fraction of the first operation, repeating several times the
/the  process of fractional precipitation (assisting the subsidence by the
      addition of kaolin), a substance was obtained the vesicating power of
      which did not seem to be increased by further treatment. The
      qnantity produced from the crotonoleic acid was, however, compara
      tively small, and, as the process of obtaining the "acid" itself from
      croton oil is extremely tedious and unproductive, we decided to seek
      for some other method of isolating the active substance, it being no
      longer of any importance to work with crotonoleic acid, since we had
      conclusively proved this substance to be a mixture.
               Isolation of the Vesicating  Constituent from Croton Oil.
          To begin with, an attempt was made to prepare a mixed lead salt
      by precipitation from the sodium salts resulting from the saponifica
      tion of croton oil with soda.     The croton oil dissolved in alcohol was
      boiled for some hours with alcoholic soda. The soap thus prepared
      was found to be non-vesicating, and so also were the fatty acids
      regenerated from it. It was therefore certain that the vesicating
      constituent of croton oil is decomposed by heating with alkalis, a
      conclusion which has since been substantiated by numerous experi
      ments.
          For this reason the lead salts were- prepared by direct saponifica
      tion of croton oil with a mixture of lead oxide and water. The lead
       "      " thus
         soap         produced was a yellowish-white sticky mass, possessing
       apparently  all the vesicating power of the original oil.    After having
       been thoroughly washed with warm water, the soap was dried in the
      water bath, mixed with sand, and the powdered mixture digested
       with ether in a stoppered bottle for about four weeks.          The ether
       was then poured off, and the digestion repeated during one week
       with two successive quantities of ether. The ethereal solutions were
       mixed together and distilled, when a thick brown sticky mass
       remained ; and this seemed to be considerably more vesicating than
       the original lead soap ; the residue of lead -ait insoluble in ether
       was much less active than the original mixture, whilst by repeated
       extraction of a part of it with ether it became almost devoid of vesi
       cating property.    It is thus clear that the vesicating substance passes
       into solution in ether together with lead oleate.           The ethereal
       residue was now extracted several times with strong alcohol, and,
       although only a small proportion dissolved on each occasion, the
       material became less and less vesicating and finally quite inactive.
       By this means the greater part of the lead oleate was separated,
       whilst the whole of the vesicating substance was dissolved by the
       alcohol. The alcoholic solutiou left on distillation a brown, nearly

                                                                 V

solid substance, having extraordinary power as a vesicant.     Albgcs
even in the cold, slowly decomposed it, the vesicating property ;
gradually lost. The acid recovered from this material, whiclt
presumably a lead salt, proved to be highly active. During n
regeneration we were surprised to notice that the material containd
very little lead, so little as to render it almost impossible foretic
vesicating substance to be itself a salt of lead. In order to inveftw
gate this important question, some of the material was dissolved in
alcohol and precipitated with a solution of sodium carbonate.      The
lead carbonate, which was but little, having been filtered off and the
alcohol removed by boiling the liquid, the solution of sodium salts
was extracted with ether.       This dissolved a small quantity of a
yellow oil, which nearly solidified on standing, forming a transparent
resinous substance.    This was proved to be more active as a vesicant
than any substance hitherto prepared.       It burned without ash and
was therefore not a sodium salt. The solution which had been
extracted with ether contained " soap," which was inactive, as were
also the fatty acids regenerated from it. Similarly, if an alcoholic
solution of the sodium salts (prepared from the lead salts) is precipi
tated with silver nitrate, the silver salt is found to be inactive ;
bnt if the filtrate is extracted with ether a powerfully vesicating
resinous substance is removed which contains no silver ; and it was
thus ascertained that the vesicating constituent of croton oil is a
resinous substance which is not an acid and cannot be saponified by
a mixture of lead oxide and water. This substance may be pro
visionally named " croton-resin."
             Isolation of Croton-resin from Crotonoleic Acid.
   It now became of interest to show that crotonoleic acid, the sup
posed active constituent of croton oil, owes its activity to the croton
                                             "
resin it contains, and not to the " acid which is present.        Some
quantity of crotonoleic acid was heated with a mixture of lead oxide
and water. The resulting lead soap was thoroughly washed with
water and extracted with alcohol, which dissolved about one-half.
The alcoholic solution was mixed with aqueous sodium carbonate,
the alcohol dissipated, and the aqueous solution extracted with ether
until it became virtually inactive. The ethereal solution left, on
evaporation, the croton resin which we had previously obtained
from croton oil. The inactive aqueous soap solution, when decom
posed, furnished a mixture of fatty acids, which was quite inactive.
   By a different method of procedure the same result was obtained.
Crotonoleic acid was warmed with aqueous sodium carbonate, which
left a portion, chiefly croton resin, undissolved. As soon as action
 was over, the liquid was extracted with ether, which removed the

•2?M2           Mr. W. R. Dunstan and Miss L. E. Boole.
  the fin resin, leaving an inactive solution of sodium salts. The resin,
  the 1. obtained was purified by dissolving it in alcohol and fraction-
  proeeJrecipitating the solution with water.       The last fraction was
  addi'emoly   active and when   dry  become a pale yellow, brittle, resinous
  whiu devoid of acid properties. It was therefore conclusively proved
  quat the so-called crotonoleic acid, hitherto regarded as the active
  tiw^stitueut of croton oil, is a mixture of fatty acids, chiefly oleic
  acid, with croton-resin, which is the true vesicating constituent of
   croton oil.
           Preparation, Properties,  and Composition of Croton-resin.
      The method by which the resin was first isolated has already been
   described. It was found advantageous to employ dilute alcohol in
   extracting the resin from the lead soap, since in this case very little
   lead salt was dissolved and the alcoholic solution needed but little
   fractional precipitation with water in order to obtain a pure product.
      Inasmuch as it is known that alcohol dissolves the vesicating con
   stituent from croton oil, leaving a bland oil behind, it seemed prob
   able that the resin might be isolated by means of fractional precipi
   tation from this alcoholic solution of croton oil, and the process of
   saponification altogether avoided.     When freshly expressed croton oil
   is shaken with rather more than twice its volume of alcohol (50 per
   cent.), very little dissolves.    After promoting subsidence by the
   addition of kaolin or asbestos, the mixture was filtered, and the alco
   holic solution evaporated to dryness, when a thick oil remained. This
   process was thrice repeated on the original croton oil.     The residues
   were dissolved in alcohol, and the solution precipitated in a number
   of small fractions by the addition of water. The first fractions were
   dark in colour and oily in consistence, whereas the last f ractions were
   pale yellow, and solidified to pale yellow resins which were highly
   active. In this process of fractional precipitation, crystals separated
   iu the early stages ; these were proved to bo cholesterol, which is
   evidently preseut in some quantity in croton oil. A still easier
  method of separating pure croton resin from croton oil consists in
   extracting the oil with more dilute alcohol (25 per cent.), when the
   resin is dissolved in a nearly pure state.    The yield is, however, so
   small that the method is not well adapted for obtaining any quantity
   of the substance. The most (-atisfactory process for separating croton-
   resin from croton oil which we have so far found is the following,
   which consists in removing the resin as far as possible from the oil
   by digesting it with alcohol, then converting the glycerides in this
   mixture into a lead soap, from which the resin is extracted by alcohol
   and purified by fractional precipitation with water.        Croton oil is
   warmed on the water bath for some hours with about twice its volume

            Nature of   the  Vesicating Constituent     of Croton Oil.      J247
of alcohol (70 per cent.). The oil is allowed         to settle, and the alccigcs
decanted. The residual oil is again twice extracted with a!coh<
the same manner. The mixed alcoholic solutions are then distillei
a small volume and the oil saponified by heating it on the water ba
with     a mixture    of freshly precipitated lead oxide and water, 'and
lead soap is thoroughly washed with warm water, mixed with w'?etic
sand, dried, powdered, and percolated with warm alcohol. DiHow
alcohol (25 per cent.) removes the resin almost pure ; but the entire
 extraction of the active constituent takes a long time, and we have
 found it in the end shorter to extract with strong alcohol (70 per
 cent.), which dissolves also a little lead oleate, and then to purify the
 resin by fractional precipitation of the alcoholic solution with water.
 The first fraction usually contains the whole of the lead salt, and the
 later fractions furnish a pale yellow, hard, brittle resin, which is
 generally quite pure, or needs but one repetition of the process of
  fractional precipitation to make it so. Croton-resin is a pale yellow,
  brittle, nearly transparent substance, which is easily reduced to a
  fine powder. Numerous attempts have been made in various ways to
  crystallise it, or to separate some crystalline substance from it, but
  in every case without success.        It contains carbon, hydrogen, and
  oxygen, but no nitrogen. Its homogeneity and composition have been
  established by the analyses of various specimens representing different
  fractions obtained by the addition of small quantities of water to its
   alcoholic solution. A specimen of the resin, which had been frac
   tionated in the manner described, was dissolved in dry ether, and the
   ethereal solution evaporated in a large flat-bottomed dish. The thin
   film thus formed was heated for two hours in the water bath and
   then exposed for some weeks in a vacuous desiccator over sulphuric
   acid. A portion of this specimen (A) was burned in two parts, with
   the following results : —

        These results show that the original resin (A) was almost pure,
   since the composition of the first fraction (A,) corresponds with that
   of the original (A), whilst between (A) and the last fraction (A3)
   is a mean difference of only 1*3 per cent, in the carbon, and 0-l
   per cent, in the hydrogen.              Combustion of different fractions
   furnishes the most delicate, and in this case the only, available test
    of homogeneity. The action of all three fractions on the skin wns
    exceedingly severe, and it was not possible to distinguish between
   them. In order to gain conclusive evidence of the constancy of the
   composition of croton-resin, a fresh quantity of croton oil was dealt
   with in the manner previously described, and the resin purified by
   fractional precipitation until it was obtained as a pale yellow hard
    solid. The new specimen (B) on combustion famished the following
    data : —
                  I.    C = 64'67 per cent.       ; H =     7'94 per cent.

        These results agree as well as could be expected with such a
    material with the mean of those obtained with fraction (A*) in the
    previous experiment; and, taking the mean of these four combus
    tions of the two different specimens, we get

        Croton-resin is nearly insoluble in water, light petroleum, and
  benzene, but dissolves readily in alcohol, ether, chloroform, acetic
  ether, and amyl alcohol ; and is deposited, even by the very slow
  evaporation of these solvents, as a pale yellow resin. Its solution
  produces no effect on polarised light. The rosin has no fixed melting
  point. A few degrees above the atmospheric temperature it softens
  and very gradually melts as the temperature is raised being quite
  fluid at 90° C.
        Croton-resin has neither basic, nor acidic properties. It is insoluble
  in dilute acids ; and nearly so in solution of sodium carbonate from
  which it can be extracted unchanged by shaking with ether.                       It
  does not      act with   metallic   oxides  and  may   be  boiled with  a mixture
  of water and lead oxide without being appreciably affected.                    On
   the other hand it is very slowly decomposed and dissolved by contact
   with aqueous caustic alkalis and is very rapidly changed if heated
   with them, the resin being gradually dissolved with much darkening
   in colour and entire loss of its vesicating power.               Ammonia acts
   much less rapidly.        Water, heated with the resin in a closed tube at
       10° C, slowly decomposes

                                       it, with formation of a dark coloured
       !sin and a mixture of acids.        Dilute acids, also, slowly decompose
      he resin when heated with it in a closed tube at 200 — 250° C.                   ;
    iiuch darkening in colour takes place and several acids are formed,
.~ but they have not hitherto           been obtained in sufficient quantity to
?
    separate    and  identify.   One   would   appear to be valerianic acid.     As
    the total quantity of pure material at our disposal has been very
    small,
         it     has not been possible, so far, to do much towards elucidating
    the question as to the constitution of croton-resin.             This seems to
    be complicated, since on decomposition with alkalis                 furnishes a
                                                                          it
    mixture     of acids,  some   of which   seem   to be  higher members of the
    acetic series.     When the resin    is  heated with strong potash solution
     (oO per cent.),
                     it   is quickly decomposed, a black re.sinous mass being
                                 " soap," from which a mixture of
    produced in addition to                                              fatty acids
     was liberated.     A very small quantity of one of these was separated
     in a nearly pure state as au oil at the ordinary temperature. It
     appeared to be oleic acid, since its silver salt contained 26-38 per
     cent, of silver, whilst silver oleate contains 27 per cent.          When the
     resin
         is    heated with a 10 per cent, solution of soda in a closed tube
      at 100° C.it   completely dissolves.      As   isusually the case, when the
      resin undergoes     hydrolysis,    a dark   coloured    quite inactive resin,
      insoluble in ether,       produced, together with a mixture of acids.

" fatty " acid   passes over, and a      further quantity may be obtained,
by extracting the residue in the flask with ether.             The acid was
neutralised with ammonia, and the aqueous solution precipitated
with calcium chloride.         The semi-crystalline precipitate was dis
solved   in  alcohol and crystallised from this solution.           The acid
removed from the calcium salt was neutralised with ammonia, and
the aqueous solution of the ammonium salt precipitated by silver
nitrate. The white voluminous precipitate was dried, and the silver
estimated.     Another portion of the precipitate was dissolved in boil
ing  alcohol,  and the crystals that separated from the solution were
also analysed, with the object of determining whether the silver salt
was a single substance or a mixture.             The percentage of silver in
the original silver salt was 30'5, whilst that in the salt crystallised
from alcohol was 31'1.        The acid, regenerated from this silver salt,
crystallised  from    dilute  alcohol, and melted at a low temperature.
In order to further characterise this acid a fresh quantity of the
silver salt was crystallised and burned with the following results : —
                   "Weight of salt                    0-1109
                   Weight of water                    0-0831

                              Ag = 3079        „
   These results indicate that the acid is one of the higher members
of the acetic series, probably either palmitic or myristic acid.          The
percentages   of  silver,  calculated from   the formulae  of the silver salts
of these acids, are, for silver palmitate, 30 per cent., and silver
royristate, 32 per cent.      The percentage of carbon found is however
too low for palmitic acid, but approximates to that contained in
myristic acid.     The question as to which member of the series the
acid corresponds with can however only be decided by further
experiments with larger quantities than we were able to command.
Although a fatty acid is produced when alkalis act on the resin, we
could find no evidence of the production of glycerine.            It may be
concluded, therefore, that the resin is not a glyceride, as was prob
able from the mode in which it was isolated.             When warmed with
strong nitric acid croton resin undergoes oxidation without forming
any nitro-compound.         A number of acids are produced in this change
of which only a preliminary examination has been made.             There are
at least two fatty acids formed, one of which closely resembles
palmitic acid, as well as valerianic acid and oxalic acid.
   The hydroiytic and oxidation products of the resin make it quite

           Nature of  the.  Vesicating Constituent   of Croton Oil.     249
clear that the molecule is a very complicated one, and that the
empirical formula deduced from the analytical data must be double 1
at least and written CMHse08.        With regard to the group of organic
compounds in which croton-resin should be included, the examina
tion of its properties points to the conclusion, to be substantiated by
further work, that, in all probability, it possesses the structure of
lactone or anhydride.        It has already been shown that it has neither
basic nor distinctly acidic properties.       It does not react with bisul
phites or with phenylhydrazine, nor does it reduce Fehling's solution.
It is therefore not a ketone or an aldehyde. Attempts to form com
pounds or derivatives of it by the action of various agents have not
been successful.     It may be well to record here that auric chloride,
silver nitrate, mercuric chloride, lead acetate, cadmium iodide, iodine,
and picric acid do not react with an alcoholic solution of croton-
 resin.
     The task of unravelling the constitution of this substance would be
 a very difficult one if not an impossible one with our present know
 ledge, and the difficulty is greatly increased by the circumstance
 that it is apparently incapable of being crystallised.       The amount of
 croton resin present in croton oil is small ; probably it does not
 exceed 3 per cent.        The extraction of the resin is not only a very
 tedious and troublesome operation, but it is one not unattended with
 danger to health.      It attacks the mucous membrane and the skin
 with great severity ; and we have evidence that when the body is
  continually exposed to its action on one part or another — by contact
  with the hand, or by the access of minute particles to the nose and
  throat, as may occur during manipulation of the dry substance, or
  during the evaporation of solutions containing it— the resin produces
  a series of secondary effects which seem worthy of special study.
     It will be seen that our experiments have led us to a conclusion
  opposed to that drawn by Buchheim, and more recently by Kobert
  and Hirscheydt. We consider that we have disproved their conclusion
                                          "
  that the so-called " crotonoleic acid is the vesicating constituent of
  croton oil. Of previous workers Schlippe had obtained results most
  in accordance with our own.        He correctly suggested that the vesi
                                                                 "         "
  cating constituent is not an acid ; and it is probable that the crotonol
  obtained by this chemist chiefly consisted of croton-resin.
     In concluding this account of our work, the expenses of which have
  been defrayed by a grant from the Royal Society out of the Govern
  ment Fund, we wish to express our obligations to the well-known
  firm of Messrs. Horuer and Sons, of Aldgate, for having furnished
  us with freshly expressed oil of undoubted purity.         The inquiry has
  been conducted in the Research Laboratory of the Pharmaceutical
  Society.

   This communication is the first instalment of a review by the aid
of instantaneous photography of the ground covered by three previous
papers (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 25, pp. 261 and 498, 1877, and ibid.,
vol. 34, p. 217, 1882), in which the phenomena that accompany
various kinds of splashes are described.      The advance made lies in
the unquestionable accuracy    and  fulness  of detail of the information
now afforded.
   The photographs which illustrate the paper are 158 in number, and
were taken by means of a suitably timed Leyden-jar spark, whose
duration was less than 3/1,000,000 of a second.      In the earlier parts
of a splash, when the changes of form are most rapid, the interval
between the consecutive stages photographed was mude less than
2/1000 or even less than 1/1000 second.      Each photograph was taken
from a separate splash.
   Interesting information is obtained as to the manner in which the
concentric outward-spreading ripples originate in the case of impacts
of small velocity (low falls), and as to the mode in which, with
higher falls, the crater thrown up closes and forms a bubble.
Specially remarkable is the difference in the disturbance set up by
the impact of a solid sphere, according as its surface is smooth, or,
on the other hand, rough or wet.         A very smooth sphere becomes
sheathed with a thin film of liquid, before it is completely immersed,
but makes no immediate visible disturbance of the general flatness of
the surface, the level of which rises simultaneously, even at quite
distant places; from this flat surface, however, there subsequently
emerges a very considerable column, not to be accounted for by the
subsidence of any neighbouring wave, and which must be due to the

wet,  the phenomena are quite different from the earliest moments of
contact, and very similar to those produced by a liquid sphere.
   Although a few theoreticul or conjectural points are touched on,
the authors prefer to abstain at present from even general explana
tions, and to put forward the photographs simply as a record of facts
of fluid motion, hoping that the puzzling nature of some of the
phenomena may evoke attention and interest among those most
 competent to explain them.

       Meyek Wildermann, Ph.D.      Communicated by Lord
       Kelvix, F.H.S. Received January 13, 1896.
                                      (Abstract.)
    The subject of this paper is the best means of determining
 freezing points in dilute as well as in concentrated solutions. Two
 things have to be considered : the proper arrangement of equi
 librium in the heterogeneous system, and the proper treatment of
 the instrument used for measuring temperature.
    A. Arrangement of Equilibrium. — I begin with the statement that
 the equilibrium between the solid and liquid solvents in the hetero
 geneous    system (ice and water) is a "perfect" one, and this is
 characterised by the fact that, at the slightest change of the temper
 ature of equilibrium, one of the two parts of the heterogeneous
 system disappears; above freezing temperature, the solid, below it,
 the liquid. In carrying out an experiment the heterogeneous system
 is simultaneously cooled down or warmed by the arrangements of
 the experiment (air bath, &c.), and the velocity with which the
 given liquid is cooled down must also come into consideration.     This
 isolated process mnst be expressed by Newton's equation, dtjdz =
 c(Jg —    in which
         t),          c inversely proportional to the quantity of liquid
                          is

 the whole volume of the liquid, and              the convergence tem

                               if             and can bo above or below
 the freezing temperature. If the convergence temperature be above
 the freezing temperature, the liquid is, ut the freezing temperature,
 continuously warmed by the experimental arrangements to a higher
 than the freezing temperature f0, and the process of ice melting takes
 place.   If the convergence temperature be below the freezing temper
 ature, the liquid is, at the freezing temperature, continuously cooled
 to a lower temperature, and the process of ice separation takes place.
  The velocity of ice melting has been found to be expressed by the
                                                                      s   2

found   at first  empirically, after a very detailed investigation, by my
late friend, P. B. Lewis, and then by myself, and form to a great
extent the subject of this paper.
   Under these arrangements of the equilibrium we get the result
tliat the freezing temperature can be kept within the very narrow
limits of one, two, three ten-thousandths of a degree (including other
experimental errors) during a time of 15 — 20 minutes, and longer,
as well when the convergence temperature              above as when          is                         it    is
below the freezing temperature.

within very narrow limits of temperature, in order that the quick
silver of the thermometer and the glass of the bulb may completely
attain the temperature of the liquid (for this the velocity with which
this takes place was measured), in order that the atmospheric pressure
and the inner pressure of the mercury column may completely exert
their influence on the read freezing temperature. It was found in the
limits of 250 mm. that if the increase of the outer pressure against
the inner be 0'96 mm., a rising of the read freezing point by 0'00031°
corresponds, and that the velocity with which the inner and outer
pressures completely exert their influence is about two minutes
in duration. (3.) Great precautions must be taken to bring the mer

I. " On     the Behaviour of Argon and Helium when submitted
       to the Electric Discharge."           By J. N. Collik, Ph.D.,
        F.R.S.E., and William Ramsay, Ph.D., F.R.S. Received
        February   4, 1896.
     The experiments to be described fall into two classes ; the first
 series relates to the distance through which electric sparks from an
 induction coil will strike through argon and through helium at
 atmospheric pressure contrasted with the length of the spark-gap in
 other gases ; and also with the pressures at which the spark-discharge
 changes into a ribbon-like discharge in different gases.      The second
 series, which was made with the object of ascertaining how much
 of one gas is detectable in its mixture with another, at different
 pressures, deals with the spectra of gases in electrodeless vacuum
  tubes. As both sets of phenomena relate to the passing of electric
  discharge through gases, we have thought it well to consider them
 together.
     The attention of one of the authors was drawn to the spark-gap, as
  a possible means of obtaining information regarding the atomicity of
  argon and helium, by Mr. Natterer, who was kind enough to send
  copies of his paper on the subject (' Wied. Ann.,' 1889, p. 663).
  Natterer's conclusion, drawn from a great many experiments, was
  that the spark-gap at atmospheric pressure varied in length inversely
  as the atomicity of the gas ; thus, in mercury gas, which is acknow-
  ledgedly monatomic, the distance traversed by a spark from electrodes
  of approximately constant potential, was very much greater than in
  diatomic gases, snch as oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, or carbon mon
  oxide ; and in these, greater than in gases of more complex molecular
  structure. Our experiments show that while with argon, the distance
  traversed by the spark is considerably greater than with air, oxygen,
  or hydrogen, with helinm the spark is capable of passing through
  most unusual distances.
     To carry out such experiments the tube must contain movable

 258         Dr. Collie and Prof. Ramsay.       Behaviour    of [Feb. 13,
 electrodes  ;   and yet, in order to avoid contamination of the   gases,
 they must       have sealed joints.    Closing with india-rnbber   corks
 appeared to work well in Natterer's experiments ; but then he had.
 large quantities of common gases at his disposal. In our experiments
 this was unfortunately not the case. Our apparatus was, therefore,
 constructed on the plan shown in the annexed figure. A is a tube
                                    Fig.  1.

  about   15   cm.  in length, and 08 cm. internal diameter.      A fixed
  platinum electrode, fused into a knob at the end, was sealed through
  the glass at B.     The wire at C was attached to a long spiral of very
  thin copper wire, which was soldered to a platinum electrode with a
  knob. In order to be able to alter the position of this electrode, it
  was enclosed in a thimble of glass, which contained a roll of soft iron
  wire, as shown at A. The position of this electrode could be altered
  by means of a magnet ; ai:d if close to A or to C, it moved on tapping
  the tube gently, for the copper spring extended, or shortened itself, if
  compressed or pulled out beyond a place of rest in the middle of the
  tube.    Gas was introduced into the vacuum tube through D ; a
  phosphorescent vacuum having previously been made by means of a
  Topler's pump ; the tube was washed out once or twice with the gas,
  before each experiment.
     The current was an intermittent one from one of Apps' large
  induction coils, driven by a storage cell giving about 8 volts. The
  hammer of the coil was not altered in position during the ex
  periments.
     It was    found impossible to make measurements of the extreme
  possible length of a spark. After the coil had been running for some
  time, an isolated spark generally passed, even when the electrodes
  were far apart.       But consistent measurements could be obtained
  when a rapid discharge began to occur on bringing the electrodes
  together. It was found possible to obtain constant readings of dis
  tance to within half a millimetre ; and to form an accurate estimate
  of the intensity of the rain of sparks, as contrasted with intermittent
   discharges.

                     Helium                 probably 250 or 300 mm.
    The tube was not long enough to obtain measurements with helium.
But     another tube with permanent electrodes, distant from each other
200 mm., gives, not sparks, but a ribbon of flame, due apparently to
the luminosity of the first spark remaining until the second has
begun its journey.       This band is of a blue colour, and does not show
the yellow D3 line very brightly. The other helium lines are much
more     brilliant.   Indeed, the D3 line is not a marked feature of the
helium spectrum at high pressure, with an unaided Ruhmkorff coil
discharge.
     As regards the purity of the samples of gas employed, it is sufficient
 to mention the method of preparation. The oxygen was made by heat
ing potassium permanganate in a small test-tube ; the air having been
expelled until the nitrogen spectrum had faded out, a large test-tube
was filled with the gas over mercury, and several times washed out.
 The third or fourth filling was taken for experiment. During the
pumping empty of the experimental tube, it could be seen that at
low pressure, none of the characteristic nitrogen bands were visible.
The air was ordinary air, free from carbon dioxide, dried by passage
 through phosphoric anhydride ; all the gases were dried thus on their
 way into the experimental tube ; and the absence of the hydrogen lines
in the case of argon and helium showed water-vapour to be absent.
 It- will afterwards be shown what a small percentage of hydrogen ia
recognisable.       The hydrogen was prepared from charged palladium,
and gave a pure spectrum. The argon had been sparked down with
oxygen and soda, the excess of oxygen having been removed with hot
 phosphorus. The helium had been circulated over red-hot magnesium
 until it gave a pure spectrum.
     It will, we think, be acknowledged that the length of spark in
 helium is a very remarkable phenomenon.           To what is it to be attri
 buted ? Any attempt to answer this question must necessarily, in our
 ignorance of what takes place during passage of discharge through
 gases, be of a speculative character.       And inasmuch as it is probably
 connected with other properties of helium, we shall postpone our
 attempt at an explanation until our further experiments have been
 described.
     After these experiments had been made it was discovered          that the
 spark discharge changes to a ribbon discharge at some definite pres
 sure with all gases. The discovery was an accidental one. We wished

2(50        Dr. Collie and Prof. Ramsay.          Behaviour     of [Feb. 13.
to repeat the experiments on the helium ribbon, and the tube was
filled with the first sample of helium that came to hand ; it had been
prepared from broggerite, and had received some contamination from
air and nitrogen. To our surprise, we failed to obtain a ribbon dis
charge at ordinary atmospheric pressure; only a rain of sparks cotild
be seen, and it was not until the pressure had been lowered by several
hundred millimetres that the discharge became ribbon-like.                This
observation led to the experiments, of which we now give an account.
    The distance between the electrodes was arranged at 170 mm. ; the
hammer of the coil was fixed in a definite position, and a freshly
charged accumulator of 8 volts was employed to drive the coil. The
first gas experimented with was dry pure air.
    1. Air. — Spark began to pass feebly at a pressure of.       . 117 mm.
               The band was continuous, but " fluffy "at .       .  70    „
              The continuous band began to disappear at. .          83    „
              On removing air, the continuous band was
                 visible at                                         74    „
    The pressure appears to be 73 or 74 mm., at which the change first
occurs.     On lowering pressure still further, the band grows less well-
defined,   and  finally fills the tube as a luminous discharge, such as is
seen in an ordinary vacuum-tube.
    2. Hydrogen.   — Sparking at                                   57 mm.

    The pressure in this case appears to be 42 or 43 mm.
    3. Oxygen. — The band was clear, but quite continuous at          33 mm.
                   On raising pressure, intermittent sparks ap
                      peared at                                       86     .,
                   Band began to be free from sparks at               81     „
                   Band disappeared again, and sparking began
                      at                                              86     „
    The pressure of the oxygen appears to be somewhat above 81 mm.
 to produce the looked-for change in character.              The amount of
 luminosity was very feeble.
    4. Carbon Dioxide. — Continuous band at                         92 mm.

     Here the critical pressure appears to    be 92 — 94 mm.

           passage   of  the spark, decomposition occurred, and the tube
           was covered with a thin film of a brownish deposit.                        The
           results may have been vitiated by this, but the difference in
          behaviour is still very striking.
         The band was broad and continuous at                            23 mm.

    6. Nitrogen.  — The nitrogen         was made from air by withdrawing
           oxygen   with    phosphorus ; it therefore contained argon. The
           transition with nitrogen was very difficult to observe.                    The
           band was always ill-defined.          The results are probably little
           to be trusted.

     These phenomena         are,  without doubt, very complex            ;  but one fact
 is   unmistakable    : that     helium presents a behaviour               very different

262          Dr. Collie and Prof. Ramsay.     Behaviour   of  [Feb. 13,
from that of all other gases. In short, a tube like those termed
" Pfliicker's tubes," need not be filled with helium at a low
                                                               pressure,
but shows all the phenomena of a vacuum-tube at ordinary atmo
spheric pressure.      The order of arrangement of the other gasefi,
moreover, is not the same as that which obtains with the shower of
sparks passing through the gas. This may be due to some molecular
change due to lowering of pressure; but such a supposition is of a
purely speculative character.
    Our next series of experiments relate to the visibility of the spec
trum of one gas in presence of another. The gases employed were
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen (atmospheric), argon, and helium ; our
primary object was a practical one — to ascertain whether the spec
trum affords an. adequate test of the purity of the gases. For
example, if the spectrum of nitrogen is no longer visible in a mixture
of argon and possibly nitrogen, can it be assumed that nitrogen is
wholly absent ? How much must the percentage of nitrogen in such
a mixture be reduced before the spectrum disappears?
    To follow how these experiments were carried out, a figure of the
apparatus employed is necessary, and a detailed description may
prove helpful to others willing to make a similar inquiry.
    The Topler pump A (fig. 2), with connection tube B, and drying
tube C (filled with phosphorus pentoxide), had a volume of 290 c.c.
up to the stopcock D. The rest of the apparatus, including connect
ing tube E, drying tube F, vacuum tube G, and tubes down to stop
cock.    H had a volume of 57'5 c.c. The ratio of the total volume
to the volume of the vacuum tube, &c., is nearly 6 : 1, and, as extreme
accuracy is not here necessary, it will be taken that, on allowing gas
to pass the stopcock D and enter the pump, its volume will be
increased and its pressure diminished in the proportion of 1 : 6.
    The vacuum tube G was without electrodes ; its wide portions were
covered with tinfoil, and connection was made with the coil by loops
of wire twisted round the foil.
    The method of introducing the gases requires description.     H is a
two-way stopcock, and the exit-tubes were curved round and stood in
a mercury trough, I.      Their ends (one of which is shown at K) were
drawn out and bent over as shown in the small figure (3), and a
slight scratch with a glass-cutter was made at the bend. The little
tubes shown in fig. 2 at K were, at a separate mercury trough,
tilled with the required gases, after being washed out by intro
ducing a few bubbles of the gas in question ; they were then trans
ferred to the trough I, and placed in the position shown.            The
whole apparatus was next pumped free of air ; the nitrogen spec
trum fades, and finally a vacuum is obtained through which a spark
will not pass ; the spark prefers to strike across between the coatings

 of tinfoil, through the air. The stopcock H was then shut, and by
 pressing down the little reservoirs on the capillary tubes, the latter
 broke at the scratches, and each U-tuDe became filled with the j^an
 contained in the reservoir placed over it. The stopcock above           H
 was then shut, and by opening H a charge of gas entered the
 space between         the two stopcocks. H was again shut, and the
 upper stopcock opened (D being shut), and the charge of gas
 filled the vacuum tube, being dried by passage through the pent-
 oxide contained in F. It should here be remarked that the gases
 underwent a preliminary drying by contact with fragments of solid
 potash in the little reservoirs at K. The charge of gas in the
 vacuum tube was, after a short time, removed by pumping until
 its spectrum disappeared and the vacuum tube ceased to conduct.
 This process was repeated several times as a precautionary measure.
     The space between         the stopcock H and the one above it held
 0'066 c.c.    ;  hence   it was possible to introduce that amount or auy
multiple of it into the vacuum tube, and when required, by open
ing the stopcock communicating with the pump, to remove five-sixths
of that amount, leaving: 0'Oll c.c. in the vacuum tube; and as this
could be done with either gas, it was possible to alter both quantity
and pressure at will.
     The first set of experiments was made with helium and hydrogen.
The pump and vacuum tube were empty after washing with helium.

    It is thus    seen that while at moderately high pressure one part of
helium in      two parts of hydrogen is not detectable, on reducing pres
sure the brilliancy of the helium increases relatively to that of hydro
gen.     These spectra were examined with direct-vision prisms: the
narrow part of the vacuum tube served for slit. The great advantage

of this method of viewing the spectrum is the very small absorption
of light; the spectrum is exceedingly brilliant.
    The secondary spectrum of hydrogen was very conspicuous in

red, red-orange, and yellow.              It appears to be brought out by the
electrodeless      tube.

        P   =  0'73 mm.        Helium yellow just visible    ; green fairly strong.
            On reducing pressure, the helium gained in strength. The
            red came out at a pressure of 0-12 mm., but it did not
            become equal to the hydrogen-red in intensity on further
            reduction of pressure.
    4. 0'060 helium       ; 066 hydrogen. No helium visible.
       P =     1*45   mm.       Helium green faintly visible ; yellow almost
            extinct.
        P = 024      mm.       A little  more distinct, but  still very faint.
    It appears possible, therefore, to detect 10 per cent, of helium in
hydrogen at low pressures ; bnt a smaller percentage would not be
seen.      Interposing a spark gap or jars made no appreciable differ
ence   in these spectra.
    The second set of experiments had for its object to ascertain
how much hydrogen could be detected in helium.                      Without enter
ing into details, it may be stated that the smallest trace of hydro
 gen can be detected in helium.             Actually the proportion was reduced
to about 1 part of hydrogen in 100,000 of helium, and the hydrogen
 lines were still easily recognised.
    The third set of experiments related to a mixture of nitrogen and
helium. Knowing that a very small amount of nitrogen could be
detected in a large amount of helium, the first charge of nitrogen was
reduced to 0002 c.c. in 57'5 of space by emptying the pump, after
 the stopcock had been left open for about ten minutes ; for experience
 has shown that the flow of gas from one part of the apparatus to
 another is very slow at small pressures.              The results were obiained
 in the   same    manner    as   before,  and are tabulated   below.

    In endeavouring by the fourth          set of experiments to establish how
small a proportion of helium conld be detected in nitrogen, we
.were unable to recognise the Ds line on account of its coincidence
with one of the yellow nitrogen bands.                But the helium green is
not interfered with, and            it was therefore looked for. The results
were   : —

    Hence it may be conjluded that it is not easy to detect 10 per
cent, of helium in nitrogen, even at low pressures.
    The fifth set of experiments relates to the detection of argon in
helium.
Argon, 50'0 p. c. at       l'67 mm. pressure.    Argon    bright ; helium faint.

                                                    still visible.

              0-06    „     104                  Argon still faintly visible.
    It   is   seen   that  1   part of argon in 2,000 of helium is still de
 tectable.       The orange line and the first green group of the argon
 spectrum are very persistent. Introduction of a spark-gap hers
 causes the argon spectrum to change to blue, and a number of blue
 lines become visible, without, however, much interfering with the
 brilliancy of the orange and green lines.
     The sixth set of experiments was directed to ascertain how much
 helium could be detected in argon.
      Helium, 50 p.       c.  at 1*67 mm. pressure.    Both easily visible.
            „      33     „      2'62       „          Helium barely visible.

            ,,   „      „     0'015       „           Stronger.
    It therefore requires a low, but not a too low, pressure, to render
125 per cent, of helium visible in argon ; for on still further reducing
pressure the helium disappeared, leaving the argon spectrum visible,
though faint.
    The seventh set of experiments deals with argon and nitrogen.
    Nitrogen, 14-3 p.  c. at  l'02 mm. pressure.      Both easily visible.
         ii     26      TJ ,' 1-04,       n           Nitrogen strong.
         'i     26      11    017         »           Nitrogen faint.
         n      0-42    11    1-05        a           Nitrogen visible.
         n      0-42    91    017         11          Nitrogen gone.
         n      0-08    11    1-05        "           Nitrogen just visible
         ii     0-08    T.    018         ))          Nitrogen gone.
    One part of nitrogen is therefore visible in 1,250 parts of argon at
 a pressure of 1 mm. ; but, on reducing pressure, its spectrum fades.
    The eighth set of experiments were directed to ascertain how little
 argon is visible in nitrogen. With 37 per cent, of argon, the reds at
 the least refrangible end of the spectrum were still visible but very
 faint; the green group was absent; and the conspicuous orange
 could not be distinguished on account of the nitrogen bands.            After
 exhausting by several strokes of the pump, the reds became more
 distinct, but the other lines were not seen, on account of the inter
 ference of the brilliant nitrogen spectrum. It is doubtful whether
 argon would be seen if a lower percentage were present.
    The ninth set of experiments were undertaken to see whether the
 presence of oxygen affected the spectrum of argon.              With 2'3 per
 cent, of argon, at a pressure of 1*04 mm., the argon reds were
 invisible, and the brilliant green group appeared as a luminosity, but
 could not be distinguished as separate lines.        The effect of oxygen is
 greatly to decrease the luminosity of the argon spectrum, so that it
 is difficult to tell whether it is visible or not. Even a very small
 quantity of oxygen has this effect.      The reduction of pressure has no
 effect in intensifying the spectrum.        It gradually grows fainter, and
 disappears.
    The reduction of pressure alters the spectrum of pure helium in a
 very remarkable way. The yellow line becomes less brilliant in
 comparison with the green.         This is not produced, as stated by Pro
 fessor Runge at Ipswich, by diffusion of one constituent of helium
                                                                     T 2

 away from another ; but as he himself has acknowledged in a private
 letter, by the cause which we ascribe. From the experiments detailed
 above, the relative strengthening of the green line may, however,
 well be clue to the persistence of that constituent of the gas which
 shows the green line; although at present we hold it as unproved
 that what is termed helium is a mixture.            It may, however, be taken
 as confirmatory of that view that, for instance, the spectrum of
 nitrogen is invisible in argon, if 0'42 per <-ent. of the former is pre
 sent at a pressure of 0'17 mm. ; and yet at a pressure of l'0.5 mm. as
 little as 0'08 per cent, of nitrogen is visible. In a mixture of nitrogen
 and argon, increase of pressure increases the brilliancy of the nitrogen
 spectrum; and it may be argued that increase of pressure brings out
 the yellow constituent of helium, leaving the luminosity of the green
 unchanged.
     The results of these experiments are summed up in the short table               &
 which follows.                                                                     $

    Broadly stated, these experiments show that while relatively large
amounts of helium and argon require to be present in hydrogen and
Tiitrogen before their spectra become visible, an exceedingly minute
amount of hydrogen or nitrogen is visible in helium or argon ; and
that a rise of pressure increases the visibility of nitrogen, both in

1S96.]      Argon and Helium submitted           to Electric Discharge.      269
helium and argon.          Also that  a  large proportion of helium must be
added to argon to become visible ; while a minute trace of argon is
visible in helium. And combining these results with those relating
to the spark-gap or to the continuous discharge, it would appear that
at atmospheric pressure, a discharge passes much more readily
through helium than through the other gases, while at very low
pressures, if conveyance of current can be inferred from luminosity
of spectrum, the current passes more readily through all other gases
than through helium ; and that a current is conveyed more readily
by nitrogen than by argon.
    In the present state of our ignorance on what occasions the passage
of current through gases, it is perhaps premature to speculate.              But,
accepting     the  hypothesis   which   appears  to be gaining   ground,  namely,
that a species of electrolysis takes place during the passp.ge — a tenta
tive explanation may be put forward. It may be supposed, as Hr.
                                                              '
 Lang has pointed out (" Dielectricitatsconstante,"              Wied. Ann.,' 56",
 p. 543) that a gas, such as hydrogen, at atmospheric pressure, is
 partially, but very slightly, ionised, or perhaps better, polarised, if
 that expression refers to atoms capable of receiving and transmitting
 an electrical charge.
     Now, the conveyance of the current is conditioned by at least two
 circumstances — first, by the number of such atoms per unit volume ;
and second, by their relative velocity, which may be taken as propor
 tional to the square root of the density of the gas.            Hence, it might
 be  inferred   that  if only few atoms    are present, great   resistance will be
 offered  — first, because of their fewness ; second, because of the fric-
 t.ional resistance offered by the molecules of gas, as distinct from the
 atoms.     It is not so easy to understand why a high electromotive
 force is required to overcome this resistance, unless it be supposed
 that the atoms capable of conveying charges neutralise each other by
 combination before the charge can be transmitted from one electrode
 to the other.      Waiving this difficulty for the present, the hypothesis
  agrees   with   the   known fact, that decrease of pressure promotes dis
  sociation, where the number of ions or molecules produced by dis
  sociation is greater than the original number of nndissociated
  molecules ; and with increased dissociation there should be, as there
  appears to be, decreased resistance in the case of diatomic gases, such
  as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.
     In considering gases, presumably monatomic, such as argon and
  helium, we see that the former offers considerably less resistance to
  the discharges at atmospheric pressure than the diatomic gases ; and
  the latter very much less.        These peculiarities may be due to their
  monatomic character, and the great difference between the length of
  the spark-gap in argon and in helium may be dependent on their
  difference of densities, and be connected with the length of the moan

tree path of their molecules.  When pressure is lowered these gases
appear to conduct less well than the diatomic gases; and it may be
that their molecular constitution is less affected, if affected at ali, by
diminution of pressure.
   The behaviour of mixturps of argon and helium at low pressures
is somewhat inscrutable.      Why should argon convey current almost
to the exclusion of helium,       if,

pressure   was  reduced.     Their pressure may, however, conduce to
some kind of polarising influence, and the conclusions, such as they
are, may be vitiated by neglecting this factor.

for research, and we shall be glad      ifthis description of our methods
of manipulation and of the somewhat meagre results which we have
obtained may induce others, better qualified than we, to make similar
investigations.

be carefully screened to prevent general illumination of the interior
of the case and ordinary photographic action on the sensitive plate.
   The arrangement may be varied by making the roof of sheet
aluminium, perhaps about a millimetre thick, and placing the sensi
tive photographic plate, or phosphorescent substance, on the outside
of this roof, or in any convenient position above it. When          photo        a

roof above it. The transparency of the aluminium for Rontgen light

that vacuum is not essential for the generation of the Rtintgen light
might seem to he demonstrated by an experiment by Lord Blythswood,
wh ch he described at a meeting of the Glasgow Philosophical Society
last Wednesday (February 5). As a result he exhibited a glass photo
graphic dry plate with splendidly clear marking which hud been pro
duced on it when placed inside its dark slide, wrapped round many
times in black velvet cloth, nnd held in front of the space between the
main electrodes of his powerful Wimshurst electrical machine, but not
in the direct line of the discharge.      He also exhibited photographic
results obtained from the same arrangement with only the differ
ence that the dark slide, wrapped in black velvet. was held in the
direct line of the discharge. In this case the photographic result
was due, perhaps wholly, and certainly in part, to electric sparks or
brushes inside the enclosing box, which was, as usual, made of
mahogany with metal hinges and interior metal mountings. It is not
improbable that the results of the first experiments described by Lord
Blythswood may also be wholly due to sparking within the wooden
case.    I have suggested to him to repeat his experiments with a
thoroughly well closed aluminium box, instead of the ordinary photo
graphic dark slide which he used, and without any black cloth
wrapped round outside. The complete metallic enclosure will be a
perfect guarantee against any sparks or brushes inside.
   If the arrangement which I now suggest, with no sparks or brushes
between AA and the roof, gives a satisfactory photographic result, or
if it shows a visible glow on phosphorescent material placed any
where in the space between AA and the roof above it, or above the
aluminium roof, it would prove the truth of Roentgen's hypothesis.
But failure to obtain any such results would not disprove this hypo
thesis.   The electric action, even with the place of the spark so close
to the field of the action sought for as it is at D, in the suggested
arrangement, may not be sudden enough or violent enough to produce
enough of longitudinal        waves, or of condensational-rarefactional
vibrations, to act sensibly on a photographic plate, or to produce a
visible glow on a phosphorescent substance.

      Rays, and the Effects produced by these Rays on Dielectrics
      through which they pass." By J. J. Thomson, M.A., F.R.S.,
      Professor of Experimental Physics, Cambridge. Received
      February 7, 1896.
    The Rontgen Tays, when they fall upon electrified bodies, rapidly
 discharge the electrification, whether this be positive or negative.
 The arrangement I have used to investigate this effect is as follows : —
 The Ruhmkorff coil and the exhausted bulb, used to produce the rays,
 are placed inside a large packing case covered with tin plate ; this is
 done to screen off from the electrometer any electrostatic disturbance
 due to the action of the coil. The needle of the electrometer is sus
 pended by a quartz fibre ; thus, as there is no magnetic control,
the needle of the electrometer is not affected by changes in the
 magnetisation of the core of the coil.
    The exhausted bulb is placed so that the phosphorescent part of it
is about \\ inches from the top of the box, and a hole about an inch in
diameter is cut in the lid of the box justover the bulb, so as to allow
the rays to emerge from the box ; a thin plate of either aluminium or
tin-foil is used to cover up the hole. The electrified plate, which
is a little larger than the hole, is placed outside the box about
2 inches above the hole in the lid, so that the Rontgen rays which
passed through the hole fall upon the plate.           This plate is kept
permanently connected with one of the quadrants of a quadrant
electrometer ; the greatest care is taken with the insulation of this
plate and of the quadrants of the electrometer. The insulation was
so good that there was no appreciable leak when the coil was not in
action. The following is the method of making the experiments :
 The two pairs of quadrants are connected together and the plate
 charged to a high potential by an electrophorus or by temporary
 connection with a large battery of small storage cells. All the quadrants
of the electrometer are now at the same potential.         The two pairs of
quadrants are now disconnected;          if the   insulation    is good the
potentials will remain the same, and there will be no deflection of the
electrometer ; in our experiments the leak is so small that under
these circumstances the movement of the spot of light is hardly per
ceptible. If, now, the Rontgen rays are directed on to the plate a
violent leakage of electricity from the plate occurs, the potential of
the quadrants connected with the plate changes, and in a few seconds
the spot of light reflected from the mirror of the electrometer is
driven off the scale. This leakage of electricity occurs whether the
plate is positively or negatively electrified ; if the plate is uncharged

1896.J        Electricity produced by the Runtgen Rays, $c.              275
to begin  with, I have not been able to detect that any charge is ac
quired  by the plate by exposure to these rays. When the potential
to which the plate is raised is high the leakage from the plate is a
most delicate means of detecting these rays, more so than any photo
graphic plate known to me. I have found these rays produce dis
tinctly perceptible effects on a charged plate after passing through
a zinc plate a quarter of an inch thick.      The charged plate and
electrometer are much more expeditious than the photographic plate
and more easily adapted to quantitative measurements.
   To determine how the radiation of the Rontgen rays depended upon
the degree of exhaustion of the bulb, the bulb was kept in connection
with the pump and the leakage was observed at different degrees of
exhaustion ; no leakage could be detected until the pressure was so
low that phosphorescent patches appeared on the bulb, and, even after
the phosphorescence appeared, the leakage was small as long as there
was any considerable luminosity in the positive column; it was not
until this had almost disappeared that the leakage from the charged
plate became rapid.
   If the greatest sensitiveness is required, it    is,
                                                   of course, advisable
to charge the plate as highly as possible.    The leakage due to the
rays, however, occurs when the potential of the plate does not exceed
that of the tin-plate cover by more than or volts, and have not

limit of potential difference below which leakage does not take
place.
   This leakage differs from that produced by ultra-violet light, the
laws of which have been unravelled by Elster and Geitel, in several
essential features, in the first place ultra-violet light only discharges
a negative charge, whilo the Rontgen rays discharge both positive
and negative.    Again, the effect of ultra-violet light       only con
                                                                   is
siderable when the electrified body       is   astrongly electro-positive
metal with a clean surface. The effects of the Rontgen rays are, on
the other hand, very marked whatever the metal, and take place
when the electrified plate  is  surrounded by solid or liquid insulators
as well as when surrounded by air.    I     have embedded the plate in
solid paraffin wax, in  solid sulphur, placed  it inside lump of ebonite,

rays, and the potential of the plate differed from that of the metal
covering of the box by from 10 to 15 volts, yet, as soon as the
Rontgen rays passed through the insulator, the charge of the metal
plate leaked away.     I have found that the electricity leaks from the
plate even   when the  space between it  and the nearest conductors con
nected to earth    entirely filled with solid paraffin hence we conclude
                  is                                      ;

that when the Rontgen rays pass through a dielectric they make it
during the time of their passage a conductor of electricity, or that
all substances when transmitting these rays are conductors of electricity.
The passage of these rays through a substance seems thus to bo ac
companied by a splitting up of its molecules, which enables electricity
to pass through it by a process resembling that by which a current
passes through an electrolyte.            By using a block of solid paraffin in
which    two   pairs of electrodes are embedded, the line joining one pair
being parallel, that joining the other pair perpendicular, to the
Rontgen rays, which were kept passing through the block, I found
that there is but little difference between the rate of leakage along
and perpendicular to the rays.

the date of the publication of Soret's short notes on this subject,
d'Arsonval* has independently, and without referring to Soret's
observations, described anew the extreme violet absorption band of
the blood-colouring matter, but without adding to the facts discovered
by the Swiss observer.
    The complete absence of all reference to Soret's scanty, but
interesting and suggestive, observations, in text-books and treatises
on physiology and physiological chemistry, the fact, which my obser
vations soon elicited, that the absorption band of Soret is much more
distinctive of the blood-colouring matter than the absorption bands
in the visible spectrum which have hitherto engrossed the attention
of observers, led me to interest myself in an investigation which
promises to throw much light on the relations of the blood-colouring
matter to other organic proximate principles, and on the transforma
 tions which the blood-colouring matter undergoes in the animal
 economy.
    In this paper it is my object merely to communicate some of the
more interesting results which          I  have hitherto obtained, a full dis
cussion of the details of the research, which are of special interest
to physiologists and physiological chemists, being reserved for future
publication.
    My observations have, for the most part. been carried out with the
aid of a spectrometer furnished with a quartz prism and quartz
lenses, and the observations were made with the help of photo
graphy.
    The substances which will be referred to in the statement of
results are the following : —
    1. Oxy-hremoglobin.        2. Haemoglobin.     3. The CO- and NO-com-
pounds of Haemoglobin.           4. The iron-containing products of decom
position  of  haemoglobin    and  of oxy-haemoglobiu, viz., Haemochromogen

porphyrin.      7.  Bilirubin,   Hydrobilirubin, and Urobilin.
    The following are some of the principal results of the investiga
tion : —
    I. The compounds of      haemoglobin with oxygen, carbonic oxide, and
nitric oxide present,     even in highly dilute solutions, an absorption
band between Fraunhofer's lines G and H. As a result of a large
number of measurements, I conclude that in the case of oxy-haomo-
globin the mean ray absorbed coincides with X 414-0, that is to sny,
the centre of absorption is slightly nearer the red end of the spectrum
than Soret bad stated ; this observer placed the centre of absorption
at h (X  4101).

278        Absorption of Violet Rays by Ihvmoglobin,     §-c.   [Tub. 13,
   As Soret had indicated, in the case of the compound of carbonic
oxide with haemoglobin, the absorption band is slightly displaced
towards the less refrangible end of the spectrum. The combination
of haemoglobin with nitric oxide presents an absorption band occupy
ing precisely the position of that of the CO-compound.
   In the case of these two compounds, the mean ray absorbed corre
sponds to \ 4205.
   II. When the molecule of dissociable oxygen is removed from oxy
hemoglobin, either by the action of reducing agents, or by boiling
in vacuo, the absorption band in the extreme violet is remarkably dis
placed towards the less refrangible end of the spectrum, the centre
of absorption corresponding to X 426'0.      When we reflect that the
addition of a molecule of oxygen to the enormous molecule of haemo
globin cannot affect in an appreciable manner the mass of the mole
cule, we must conclude that the displacement of the absorption band
towards the ultra-violet end when haemoglobin combines with oxygen
(all other conditions remaining the same), indicates that this com
bination leads to a notable acceleration of the intra-molecular move
ment, which is the cause of the absorption of the extreme violet rays
by haemoglobin.
   III. The absorption of the extreme violet depends on the iron-con
taining moiety of the haemoglobin molecule, for, whereas it is not
presented by the albuminous product of the decomposition of the
blood-colouring matter, it is characteristic of the acid compounds of
haematin and of haomochromogen.
   IV. Solutions of alkaline haematin, even when enormously diluted
(1 : 30,000 of water), exert a general absorption of the ultra-violet
and extreme violet, but present no trace of definite absorption,
either in the extreme violet or the adjacent ultra-violet region.
   The compounds of haematin with acids, e.g., haematin hydrochloride,
present even in solutions of great dilution (1 : 25,000
                                                         — 1 : 60,000) nu
intense absorption band, which encroaches more and more on the
ultra-violet as the strength of the solution increases.      In a solution
containing one part of crystallised haematin hydrochloride in 20,000
parts of glacial acetic acid the band extends between h and M, the
most intense absorption being between h and L. The less refrangible
border of this baud is sharply defined, whilst the more refrangible
border is less definite.  As the solution is diluted, the band becomes
 narrower, through less and less of the ultra-violet being absorbed.
 In highly dilute solutions the band which is still intense absorbs both
 H  and  K.
   The acid compounds of haematin exhibit, therefore, an absorption
band, which is exactly on the boundary of the ultra-violet proper,
and which extends further and further into the ultra-violet as the

    .V. Solutions of hapmochromogen (reduced haematin of Stokes)
exhibit an intense absorption band between h and G. The band has
the same position as the band of CO-haemoglobin, but is more intense.
With      one part of haemoehromogen in 25,000 parts of water (the
stratum examined being 10 mm. thick), an intense absorption band
occu pies the region      between X 410'0 and X 430-0.      From the examina
tion    of solutions of various strengths, it results that the mean ray
absorbed corresponds to \ 420'0.
    VI.    The absorption of the extreme violet and ultra-violet by
 metbaemoglobin indicates that this body is the product of a partial
 decomposition of the molecule of oxy-haemoglobin.
     VII.   The band in the extreme violet (and ultra-violet), which is
 characteristic of haemoglobin, its compounds, and certain of its iron-
 containing derivatives, in no respect depends upon the iron in the
 molecule. This conclusion is based (1) on the fact that none of the com
 pounds of iron, organic or inorganic, possess the property of producing
 a definite absorption in the extreme violet or the adjacent ultra-violet ;
  (2) upon the study of haematoporpbyrin, a body derived from haematin
  by the removal of the iron which this body contains.
     Acid solutions of haemotoporphyrin of extreme dilution exhibit an
  absorption band between h and H. If the solution be slightly more
  concentrated K is absorbed, and with increasing concentration of the
  solution the absorption of the ultra-violet extends more and more.
  Alkaline solutions of haematoporphyrin absorb the same spectral
  region, but the intensity of the absorption is greater.
     VIII.    Neither bilirubin, hydrobilirubin, nor urobilin present any
  definite absorption band in the region of the spectrum where the
   absorption band of haemoglobin and its derivatives occurs.

                   Part I. — Diffusion of Molten Metals.
   In  the first part of the paper the author alludes to some earlier
experiments he made in 1883 on the diffusion of gold, silver, and
platinum in molten lead.      He points out that although the action of
osmotic pressure in lowering the freezing point of metals has been
carefully examined, very little attention lias been devoted to the
measurement, or even to the consideration, of the molecular move
ments which enable two or more metals to form a truly homogeneous
fluid mass.     The absence of direct experiments on tho diffusion of
molten metals is probably explained by the want of a sufficiently
accurate method. Ostwald had stated, moreover, with reference to
the diffusion of salts, that " to make accurate experiments in diffu
sion is one of the most difficult problems in practical physics," and

the difficulties are obviously increased when molten metals diffusing
into each other take the place of salts diffusing into water.
    The continuation of the research was mainly due to. the interest
 Lord Kelvin had always taken in these experiments. The want of
a ready method for the measurement of comparatively high tempera
tures, which led to the abandonment of the earlier work, was over
come when the author arranged his recording pyrometer, and the use
of thermo-j unctions in connection with this instrument rendered it
possible to measure and record the temperature at which diffusion
occurred.     Thermo-jnnctions were placed in three or more positions
in either a bath of fluid metal or an oven carefully kept hotter at the
top than at the bottom. In the bath or oven, tubes filled with lead
were placed, and in this lead, gold, or a rich alloy of gold, or of the
metal under examination, was allowed to diffuse upwards against
gravity.    The amount of metal diffusing in a given time was ascer
tained by allowing the lead in the tubes to solidify ; the solid metal
was then cut into sections, and the amount of metal in the respective
sections determined by analysis.
   The movement in linear diffusion is expressed, in accordance with
Fick's law, by the differential equation
                                dv     d*v
                                   ~       '

   In this   equation * represents distance in the direction in which
diffusion takes place, v is the degree of concentration of the diffusing
metal, and t is the time ; k is the diffusion constant, that is, the
number which expresses the quantity of the metal in grams diffusing
through unit area (1 sq. cm.) in unit time (one day) when unit differ
ence of concentration (in grams per c.c.) is maintained between the
two sides of a layer 1 cm. thick. The author's experiments have shown
that metals diffuse in one another just as salts do in water, and the
results were ultimately calculated by the aid of tables prepared by
Stefan for the calculation of Graham's experiments on the diffusion
of salts.
    The necessary precautions to be observed and the corrections to
be made are described at length, and the values of the diffusivity of
various metals in lead are then given.
   The values for k, the diffusivity, given in sq. cm. per day, are as
follows : —

          The second part of the paper        devoted to the consideration of the
                                             is

                                                                          is
      there has long been prevalent belief that diffusion can take place in
                            a
      solids, and the practice in conducting important industrial operations
      supports this view. In this connection the author cites two truly
                                   "
       venerable " cementation processes.         The object in the first of these
      is  the  removal of silver from  a solid gold-silver alloy, while the second
       is employed in steel-making by the carburisation of solid iron. In
-f    both of these processes, however, a gas may intervene, though the
      -carburisation of iron by the diamond, which had been effected in vacuo
       by the author, suggests that      a gas does intervene in the latter case,
                                        if
       its quantity must be very minute. In connexion with the mobility of
       various- elements in iron the work of Colson, of Osmond, and of
       Moissan  is  specially referred to.
          The author points out that in 1820 Faraday and Stodart showed
       that platinum will alloy with steel at a temperature at which even
       the steelis   not melted, and they express their interest in the forma
       tion of alloys by cementation, that       by the union of solid metals.

284                   On the Diffusion   of Metals.           [Feb. 20r
nates  over the other," is shown to have afforded ground for the
anticipation that metals would diffuse into each other at temperatures-
far below their melting points. Reference is then made to the im
portant work by Spring in 1886 on the lead-tin alloys, which retained
a certain amount of molecular activity after they had become solid,
and special importance is attached to the proof afforded by Spring, that
alloys may be formed either by the strong compression of the finely
divided constituent metals at the ordinary temperature (1882) or
(1894) by the union of solid masses of metal compressed together at
temperatures which varied from 180° in the case of lead and tin, to-
400° in the case of copper and zinc ; tin melting at 227° and zinc
at 415°.
   The evidence as to the volatilisation of solid metals is then traced,
and allusion is made to the expression of Robert Boyle's belief,,
that even such solid bodies as glass and gold might respectively
" have their little
                    atmospheres, and might in time lose their weight."
   Merget's experiment on the evaporation of frozen mercury is
quoted in relation to Gay-Lussac's well-known discovery that the
vapours emitted by ice and water both at 0° C, are of exactly equal
tension.
   Demarcay's experiments on the volatilisation of metals in vacuo at
comparatively low temperatures is connected with the evidence-
afforded by Spring (1894), that the interpenetration of two metals at
a temperature below the melting point of the more fusible of the
two is preceded by volatilisation.
   The author then points out that, interesting as the results of the-
earlier experiments are, as affording evidence of molecular inter
penetration, they do not, for the purpose of measuring diffusivity,
come within the prevailing conditions in the ordinary diffusion of
liquids, in which the diffusing substance is usually in the presence of
a large excess of the solvent, a condition which has been fully main
tained in the experiments on the diffusion of liquid metals described
in the first part of the paper. Van't Hoff has made it highly prob
able that the osmotic pressure of substances existing in a solid solu
tion is analogous to that in liquid solutions, and obeys the same laws:
nnd it is probable that the behaviour of a solid mixture, like that of
ft liquid mixture, would be greatly simplified if the solid solution
were very dilute.
   The author -proceeds to describe his own experiments on the diffu
sion of solid metals. They are of the same nature as in the case of
fluid metals, except that the gold, which is the metal chosen for
examination, was placed at the bottom of a solid cylinder of lead
instead of a fluid one.

     The experiments at the ordinary temperature are still in progress,
%out    there is evidence that slow diffusion of gold in lead occurs at the
•ordinary temperature. The author points out that if clean surfaces
 of lead and gold are held together in vacuo at a temperature of only
 40° for four days, they will unite firmly, and can only be separated
 by the application of a load equal to one-third of the breaking strain
 of lead itself.
     The author thinks it will be considered remarkable that gold placed
 At the bottom of a cylinder of lead, 70 mm. long (which is to all
  appearance solid), will have diffused to the top in notable quantities
 At the end of three days. He points out that at 100° the diffusivity
  of gold in solid lead can readily be measured, though its diffusivity
  is only 1/100,000 of that in fluid lead at a temperature of 500°. He
  also states that experiments which are still in progress show that the
  diffusivity of solid gold in solid silver, or copper, at 800° is of the
  same order as that of gold in solid lead at 100°.
     He concludes by warmly thanking Mr. A. Stansfield, B.Sc., who
 assisted him in all but the earlier portion of the work, and by ex
  pressing the hope that the experiments described in the paper will
 .show that the diffusion can readily be measured in solid metals, and
   that they will carry one step further the work of Graham.

        the Spleen." By E. A. Schafer, F.R.S., and B. MooitE.

    "We have investigated,       in four dogs, the effects upon the spleen
 volume of     excitation of the thoracic and lumbar nerve-roots.           In all
 four   cases  the animals were fully anaesthetised, at first with chloro
 form and      afterwards with morphia, and were curarised, artificial
 respiration    being maintained in the usual way. The spinal cord was
 then exposed in the dorso-lumbar region, and the nerve-roots on both
 sides tied and cut close to the dura mater, the latter with the enclosed
 portion of cord being then entirely removed. The blood pressure
 in the aorta was recorded by a tube tied into the carotid artery and
 connected with a mercurial manometer, and the spleen volume was
 simultaneously inscribed by a tambour connected with the spleen
 plethysmograph       (see preceding paper, p. 229).
     The following are the results which we have obtained from exci
 tation of the nerve-roots from the second postcervical to the fifteenth
 postcervical inclusive.      In none of the four experiments did excita
 tion of the second postcervical (second dorsal) pair produce any
  contraction of the spleen.        In none of the four experiments did
 excitation of the fifteenth postcervical pair prodnce any contraction
  of the spleen.       In three out of the four experiments a distinct
  contraction of   the  spleen was got on stimulation of all the roots on
  both sides from the third postcervical to the fourteenth postcervical
  inclusive.    This effect was relatively smaller on stimulation of the
  third and fourth postcervical nerves and of the eleventh to the four
  teenth postcervical than on stimulation of the intermediate pairs, the
  most marked effects being obtained from the sixth, seventh, and
  eighth pairs (compare tracings 1 and 2). In all cases the effect was

got, as already stated, from the nerve-roots of both sides, but with
each nerve pair it comes out as an almost constant occurrence that
a decidedly less marked effect is obtained with the same strength of

in the tracings.

 1896.]      Nerve-Jibres  which produce Contraction   of the Spleen.  289
     In  one out of the four experiments contraction of the spleen was not
obtained by stimulation of the eleventh and twelfth postcervical pairs
"of nerve-roots, nor of the thirteenth root on the right side, although
obtained with all the other nerve-roots from the third to the four
 teenth postcervical inclusive.     It is possible that this lack of effect
 may have been due to some accidental cause which we were nnable
 to discover, or there may have been an individual peculiarity in the
 •nerve distribution in this animal.
     .We have found that after intravenous injection of small doses of
 nicotine, the effect upon the spleen of stimulating the nerve-roots
 .may entirely disappear, while stimulation of the splanchnics is still
.quite effective. We infer, therefore, that the nerve-fibres which pro
 duce contraction of the spleen have a cell station in the prevertebral
.chain of ganglia.
     .We have not obtained any evidence regarding the nerve-root origin
 of the dilating or inhibitory fibres which we have shown to pass to
 the spleen by the splanchnic nerves (see previous paper, p. 230).
                                  Conclusions.
     The muscular tissue of the spleen in the dog is innervated through
 an extraordinarily large number of nerve-roots, viz., from the third
  postcervical to the fourteenth postcervical inclusive.
     The largest outflow, if we may judge by the amount of contraction
  produced, occurs from the fifth postcervical to the ninth postcervical
  inclusive.
     Reasoning in the same way, the outflow is in each pair of nerve-
  roots larger upon the left than upon the right side, i.e., it is not
  bilaterally symmetrical.
      The outflowing fibres probably have a cell-connection in the main
  ganglionic chain of the sympathetic.
      So far as we have been able to ascertain, there are no published
  observations bearing directly upon the subject of this communication.
   Dr. J. Rose Bradford attempted some years ago, in this laboratory,
   to determine the spinal-root connections of the spleen with the aid of
  Roy's oncometer, but he enconntered considerable difficulty, and the
  results which he was able to obtain were inconclusive.       He informs
  os,  however,  that  he got contraction   of the organ on stimulation of
  nerve-roots in the thoracic region on both sides, although the limit*)
  of the outflow were not decided, and that there was a tendency to
  greater contraction on stimulation of the roots on the one side than
  on the other.

                            Note added March 9.
   Since the above was communicated to the Society we have made,
at the suggestion of Mr. Langley, some further experiments upon the
action of nicotine, employing cats instead of dogs (since in his
experience the action of nicotine upon dogs is much more uncertain
and difficult of interpretation).       We find that iu the cat a small dose-
of  nicotine   (1   to 3  milligrams) temporarily abolishes the effect of
stimulating the nerve-roots, whilst only slightly diminishing the effect
of stimulating the splanchnics ; this being the same result as that
above described upon the dog.            On the other hand, a large dose of
nicotine (10 to 12 milligrams) entirely abolishes the effects of stimu
lating both the nerve-roots and the splanchnics, whilst the nerves
which pass to the spleen along with its blood-vessels are still freely
excitable. It is clear, therefore, from the last result that large doses
of nicotine cause a complete block between the splanchnics and the
splenic nerves, i.e., in the semilunar ganglion ; so that there is, in all
probability, a cell station in this ganglion for all the splenic fibres^
On the other hand, as we have seen above, a block is apparently
produced by small doses of nicotine between the nerve-roots and
the splanchnics, i.e., in the ganglia of the chain. Whether this is
really due, as we have suggested in the text, to the existence of
another cell-connection in these ganglia, or whether, as Mr. Langley
has suggested to us, it is capable of another interpretation is a ques
tion which we propose to reserve for a detailed communication of our
experiments in the 'Journal of Physiology,' and wo will also defer
until that communication reference to a paper by Bulgak on the in
nervation of the spleen, which appeared in Virchow's 'Archiv,'
vol. 69, 1877, and which had escaped our attention.
II.  " A Method for rapidly producing Diphtheria Antitoxines..
      Preliminary Note."* By G. E. Cartwbight Wood, M.D.,.
      B.Sc. Communicated by Dr. Pte-Smith, F.R.S. Received
      February 20, 1896.
   The method for producing antitoxines, described in this preliminary
communication, is the outcome of an investigation into the action of
the products of the diphtheria bacillus on which              I  have been engaged
   * The investigation has been carried out  in the laboratories of the Royal College
of Physicians and Surgeons, and  I should like here to express my great indebtedness
to the Laboratories Committee for the facilities there afforded to me.    I must also
thank them ond, through them, the Honourable Goldsmiths' Company, from whose
Research Fund a grant was placed at my disposal.

189(3.]           rapidly producing Diphtheria Antitoxines.                    291
for more than a year.         The toxines described by Continental observers
have been those obtained from broth cultivations of the organism,
where we cannot expect the products, even if identical in nature, to
be present in the same proportions as when vegetating in the living
body of an animal. More than eight years ago Hueppe* and I pointed
out that we must grow the pathogenic organism on a natural
albumen if we wished to obtain the toxines proper of the microbe ;
and working on this principle by inoculating hens' eggs with Koch's
cholera bacillus we succeeded in producing much more powerful
poisons than had been previously obtained. The toxines produced by
the action of the diphtheria bacillus on albumen have been minutely
investigated by Sidney Martin, and the occurrence of the same sub
stances in the bodies of patients who have succumbed to the disease
has proved the correctness of this view.              In this communication      I
shall not enter into the precise nature of the products in question, as
my present purpose is to describe a practical method of rapidly pro
ducing powerful diphtheria antitoxines.
   In these experiments two species of diphtheria toxine were made
use of : firstly, the ordinary toxine produced by the organism in
peptone broth ; secondly, the substances present in serum-broth cul
tivations which had been filtered and heated up to 65° C. [In the
former the active principle consists almost entirely of the so-called
ferment toxine, while in the latter this has been destroyed by heating
up to 65° C., so that its action must depend on the presence of other
substances.]t        The medium employed for the production of the serum
toxine was ordinary peptone broth, to which an addition of 10 or 20
per cent. blood serum or plasma had been added ; where the latter
was used the broth was previously decalcified to prevent coagulation.
As a rule the broth was inoculated with a virulent diphtheria culture
some three or four days previous to the addition of the serum or plasma,
and then incubated at a temperature of 37° C. for at least three or four
weeks. Before being used for injection it was subjected to a tem
perature of 65° C. for about an hour and then filtered through a
sterilised Chamberland candle to remove the bodies of the bacilli.
This fluid will be spoken of subsequently as " serum " toxine in contra
distinction to the ordinary poison, which will be spoken of as-
" broth " toxine. The serum toxine is characterised chiefly by giving
rise to little local irritation but marked febrile reaction which is
still more pronounced when the injection is repeated.                       As the
diphtheria albumose described by Sidney Martin was characterised
by precisely these properties, in all probability the potency of the
serum toxine depends on its presence. In addition to these properties,
however, it was found that animals which had been subjected to its

action were rendered more or less refractory to subsequent infection,
and this suggested the possibility of its application as a means of
shortening the preliminary treatment which a horse must undergo
before it can receive the large doses of broth toxine which are usually
necessary for the production of antitoxine of any strength.
   The first horse (No. 1) was treated on the same general principles
which are adopted in immunising guinea pigs ; that is to say it receives
a certain quantity of the vaccinating substance and after the lapse of
ten or fourteen days it is subjected to the action of the microbe or

toxine. During the first twelve days this horse received 380 c.c. of
serum toxine (see Table I) spread over three injections on different
dates.    On the nineteenth day of the experiment it received 50 c.c. of
•unfiltered serum toxine (sterilised at 65° C.) and 150 c.c. of broth toxine,
of which one half c.c. killed a 500 gramme guinea-pig in forty-eight
hours.     The unfiltered serum toxine unfortunately gave rise     to a small
abscess which greatly impeded the treatment, and subsequent experi
ence has convinced me that the bodies of the bacilli which gave rise
to this irritation must be removed by filtration if the process is to be
parried out smoothly and successfully. On the 28th day it received
50 c.c. of the same broth toxine, and on the 30th day another injection
of 115 c.c.
    The horse was then bled on the thirty-second day of treatment, and
the serum was found to possess the strength of ten normal units,
that is to say, 1 /100th of a c.c. protected a 250 gramme guinea-pig
against ten lethal doses of broth toxine. As this strength is only
attained by Koux's method after at least ten weeks' treatment, it was
evident that the serum toxine had considerably shortened the process.
 It may be mentioned that the horse, which had been in very poor
condition at the beginning of the treatment, steadily improved
during the month. The experiment was not carried further with
this horse, which was then subjected to the ordinary method for
producing antitoxines, when it reacted in every respect like an
animal which had been under the usual treatment for several
 months.
    In the case of the next horse (No. 2) it seemed safe to inject much
larger quantities of the serum toxine, but to avoid the risk of con
stitutionally injuring the animal the addition of a certain amount of
antitoxine was made. During the first twelve days (Table II) 1350 c.c. of
serum toxine had been injected and mixed with this 50 c.c. of antitoxine
obtained from the previous horse, each c.c. of which contained ten
normal units. During the next week 550 c.c. of broth toxine (of which
1/4 c.c. killed a 500 gramme guinea-pig in forty-eight hours) was
injected, spread over three injections, and to the last of these 100 c.c.
of serum toxine was added. In the succeeding week it received
400 c.c. of the same broth toxine mixed with 250 c.c. of serum toxine
in two injections. On the thirtieth day the animal was bled (3/4 of a
litre) and the antitoxic value of its serum estimated. It was found
that 1/100, 1/200, 1/300, 1/400, 1/500, and finally ] /1000th of a c.c. pro
tected completely against ten lethal doses of the toxine.          After six
weeks of treatment l/1600th of a c.c. protected against ten lethal
doses, while on the ninth week l/2500th of a c.c. sufficed.
   In this experimer.t, which furnished such brilliant results, as has
been stated antitoxine was mixed with the serum toxine injected, but
that this was not at all necessary was shown by a subsequent experi

The serum of this animal was tested dnring the first and second
weeks, before it had received any broth toxine, and it was found that
l/300th and l/500th of a c.c. respectively protected guinea-pigs against
ten lethal doses. On the third week l/850th of a o.c. protected, and
at the end of a month l/1250th of a c.c. sufficed.   [The large amount

    Although the serum toxine had been used primarily in the expecta
tion of rapidly immunising the animal, and thus shortening the
necessary   period of treatment, the very high antitoxic value of the
serum obtained from horses Nos. 2 and 3 suggested that the method
might be applied effectively at a later stage. For the purpose of
testing this a number of horses which had been under the ordinary
treatment for from six to nine months were very kindly placed at my
disposal by Dr. Woodhead.           In the first experiments 200 or 300 c.c.
of the serum toxine was mixed with the ordinary broth toxine, and
injected as usual. The results obtained, although slightly better,
were not at all so marked as one might have expected. On examining
more in detail the horses in which the best results had been obtained,
it was found that these had been under more or less continuous
treatment with the serum toxine, both toxines being injected as fre
quently and in as large amounts as possible. Guided by these facts
four of the horses (Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7) received one evening each 300 c.c.
of serum toxine, and on the following morning an injection of weak
broth toxine. Although the quantity of weak broth toxine would,
nnder normal conditions, have produced hardly any effect, it produced
on this occasion most marked local and constitutional reactions.
During the remainder of the week these horses received injections of
weak broth toxine each day, or on alternate days according to their
condition, and on each occasion these gave rise to quite definite con
stitutional and local reactions. During the following week an injection
of 300 c.c. of serum toxine was introduced, succeeded by similar
quantities of weak broth toxines, as in the previous week. [It will
be observed that all these horses received practically the same quan
tities of toxine, with the exception of horse No. 5, in which the

injections were stopped earlier than the others, owing to its tempera
ture showing a tendency to remain permanently elevated.                     In horses
Nos. 6 and 7 the production of antitoxine was much less than m
Nos. 4 and 5, and this is, no doubt, to be ascribed to the injections
producing much less marked reactions, owing, apparently, to their-
greater refractoriness.           In all probability, however, this condition
might have been overcome by the use of larger injections and stronger
broth toxine.]        The rise in antitoxic value of the serum of these
 horses is shown in the appended table (Table IV) .

    These results indicate very strikingly that the rapid production of
 antitoxine depended, at any rate in great part, on the cumulative action
of the toxines by means of which the animal was kept in a chronic
condition of local and constitutional reaction. It is probable that we-
                                                                              "
 produce in this way the earlier stages of that condition of super-
                " described
sensitiveness                    by Behring, in which an animal whose blood
 may be charged       with   the  most powerful antitoxines, suffers the most
profound constitutional disturbance on the introduction of even the
 smallest quantities of toxine, while at the same time the temperature-
of the animal may remain for months permanently elevated above
the normal.     By taking advantage, however, of this cumulative action
in its earlier effects,    we are furnished with a means of easily producing
 much more powerful antitoxines than is otherwise possible, and it is
probable that by the use of stronger broth toxine the method may be
carried still further in this direction.           This cumulative action may
also be taken advantago of to obviate that most troublesome occur
rence where an animal becomes apparently absolutely refractory,
ceasing to react to the toxine and failing to produce antitoxine, so that
 it has to pass out of use for the purpose of producing the curative
 serum. Some preliminary experiments have, however, indicated that

 1896.]         rapidly producing Diphtheria Antitoxines.                    297
this cumulative action may be produced still more markedly by the
use of other toxines than those elaborated by the diphtheria bacillus,
                  I
a result which was quite prepared for, as Woodhead* and myself had
in a previous communication drawn special attention to this stimula
tive action of bacterial products.
    Although this part of the investigation is still quite incomplete,
an application of this principle, which may be of importance, may
be here suggested.         The excessively costly nature of snake venom
and the practical difficulties of obtaining it in sufficient quantities
have been a great obstacle to the immunisation of the larger animals
or the production of anti-venines of any high degree of strength.
It is probable that by the use of other toxines in the later stage
the quantities of the costly snake venom necessary may be greatly
 lessened.
     [In this preliminary       communication I have dealt with horses
which have been under treatment only for a short period, and have
 shown that antitoxines at least as strong as the best in use can be
quickly and easily produced, but I have every reason to believe that,
under more prolonged treatment, much more powerful diphtheria
antitoxines can be obtained than has been previously possible.]
    In conclusion it may be said that the following advantages may
be claimed for the use of the toxines in the way            I have described.
    1. That powerful diphtheria antitoxines can bo produced without
risk in a much shorter period of time than has been previously
possible.
    2.  That much more powerful antitoxines can be easily produced
 so that   the amount necessary to be injected into a patient can be
 greatly   reduced,  and one of the great objections to its introduction
 into private practice in this country may be removed.
    3.  That the greater strength of the serum will permit of the
patient receiving at the beginning of treatment a sufficient quantity
of the serum at one injection, when, as is universally recognised
both by animal experiment and clinical experience, its curative
action is exerted most markedly.
    I  must acknowledge my extreme indebtedness to the Director of
 the Laboratories, Dr. Sims Woodhead, for much invaluable advice
 and assistance during the course of this investigation.

       Note      on  Reproductive Selection."                By Karl Pearson,
        University College, London. Communicated by F. Galton,
        F.R.S. Received February 13, 1896.
    (1)  In    a recent memoir (" Contributions               to the Mathematical
Theory     of  Evolution,  III.    Regression, Heredity, and Panmixia," now
                                                            I
in type for the ' Philosophical Transactions ') have found it neces
sary to note the difference in mean and variation of a population
when (a) the individuals of a sex are taken into account owe as
mates, (b) when the individuals of a sex are treated as parents or
weighted with their fertility. The mean and variation of the popu
lation are supposed to be taken with regard to any organ whatever.
 If such a difference is found to exist between the variation curves
for mates and for parents, then there is a correlation between fertility
and the organ (or characteristic) measured.                    Under the action of
heredity      there  will  accordingly     be   a progressive evolution in this
organ, unless this evolution be checked by some other factor of pro
gressive change, e.g., natural selection. In my memoir                   I term this
factor of progressive evolution Reproductive Selection*                      Without
    * The influence of variation in fertility has been considered by Mr. Romanes
under the title of ' Physiological Selection,' but the ftlea he expresses by this term
appears to me very different from that of reproductive selection.      In mathematical
language, Mr. Romanes supposes the fertility curve and the correlation surfaces,
owing to some cause or other, to become double-humped ; they may accordingly be
resolved into two components, each corresponding to a distinct species.         Physio
logical selection thus aims at an explanation of the origin of species. Reproductive
selection supposes the fertility curve and correlation surfaces to embrace only
homogeneous material, and it can accordingly never give rise to a new species ; it is
purely a source of progressive change in the same species.       The only approach to a
 double hump which occurs in the curves of human fertility that I have dealt with
 is a secondary maximum at absolute infertility, due in all probability to artificial
                                                                           T 2

 wishing at present to publish my complete work on this subject,                      I
  should like to put on record the following conclusions already
  reached    : —
      (2) Let any organ in individuals of one sex be selected, and let y
  be the    fertility of an individual, whose organ differs x from the
  mean organ of all mated individuals.             Let Mm be the mean organ for
  all mates,* M, be the mean organ for all parents, i.e., a mate reckoned
  once for each offspring.             Let M0 be the mean of the offspring
  for the same or any other organ, taking one or any other number
  equally from each mated individual, let M, be the mean of aH off
  spring.      Let om, af, <r0, <Ti be the corresponding standard deviations,
 reckoned from the formula : <x3 = (sum of squares of deviations) -f-
  (number of individuals), and without regard to any special law of
  variation, such as Laplace's law of errors.
     Let r0 be the coefficient of correlation between parent and offspring,
 each parent being given only one or, at any rate, an equal number of
 offspring, i.e., r0 is the coefficient of pure heredity for the organs in
 question, supposing fertility to be uniform, or at any rate to have no
 correlation with the organ or characteristic under investigation. Let p
 be the correlation between fertility and the given organ in the parent,
 and let v equal the coefficient of variation of fertility in the parent.
 i e., if ym be the mean fertility : v = a/jym, where a/ is the standard
 deviation of parental fertilities. Let y' = y — ym be the deviation from
 mean fertility of the parent with organ x.              The valnes of r0 and p are
 to be calculated from the formulae —
          _    Sum of (deviation of offspring x deviation of parent)
                 Number of pairs of offspring and parent x it0 x am
        _  Sum of (deviation of mate x deviation of mate's fertility)
                           Number of mated pairs xamx<r/
 where, in r0, each parent is to be taken only once, or at any rate tbe
 same number of times.
     Thus r„ and p are absolutely independent of any special distribu
tion of variation.
     Then the following results hold if n be the number of mated
pairs : —
                            My = NM+Pvom                                           (i).

restraint  on fertility.   As those couples who fall into this component leave no
offspring, they   cannot give rise to a new species.

influence of this portion of sexual selection.

    The first three equations are true whatever be the distribution of
variation in mates, parents, offspring, and fertility; the fourth equa
tion assumes the standard-deviation of a fraternity or an array of
offspring to be <r02(l — r„). This result would flow for normal corre
lation between organs in parent and offspring, a type of correlation
which holds closely for inheritance in the case of man. It would
also flow from any law of variation which gave a constant coefficient
of regression and          a constant   standard deviation for the array.
What, however, is the important point is this, that no assumption
has been made with regard to the nature of the fertility correlation.
This is essential, as certainly in the case of man this correlation is
like the distribution of variation in fertility, markedly skew and not
normal in character. Our equations accordingly amply cover facts,
 which they could not cover had they been solely based on the usual
 «ir normal theory of correlation.
     (3) By simply forming the means for any organ (or characteristic)
for mates and for parents, we can ascertain from Equation (i), if
 there is or is not any sensible correlation between that organ (or cha
 racteristic) and fertility. Equation (ii) enables us to verify the value
found for p, since «p and am are easily calculated when we know the
 distribution of fertility.      If the correlation were normal S(x"y')
 would be zero, and this term it may reasonably he expected will never
 be very large.        When p has been found from Equation (i), then
 liquations (iii) and (iv) give us Mi — M0 and <xi — <r0, or the measures
 if reproductive selection in its action on the mean and variation of
 mccessive generations.
     (4)  I  have applied these results to the only case — that of man — in
 which statistics are at present available.
     I find for upwards of 4,000 families, principally of Anglo-Saxon
 race, v = 0-692, and for 1,842 families of Danish race, v = G'652.
 This, considering difference of race, is a very satisfactory agreement.
 In the next place there appears to be a significant difference 0'278"
 between the mean height of mothers of daughters and the mean
 height of wives.         Thus we have pvam = 0-278", and since an =
 2-303",    it follows  that pv = 0121.    Now, the coefficient of variation
for fertility in daughters is not quite the same, but still very nearly
 the same as that for fertility in general. We therefore find that
 p "= 0175 to 0-186, according as we use the first or second value of
 v given above.          We therefore conclude that there is a sensible
 correlation (circa 0'18) between fertility and height in the mothers
 of daughters.

      Turning now to Equations (iii) and (iv), I note that r<,, <r„, and ru*
   are  multiplied by the small quantities/} and \ — (apjamy, and that r„
   and <r„, only differ from rf and af by quantities of the order p.
   Hence, neglected to a first approximation p1, we can use the value rp,
   already known, for r„ in (iii) and (iv) and the value wit already
   known for e„ in (iii), we thus deduce —
                               M, — M, = 0'08l".
                                       <r0 = —0-008".
                                 <r, —
      These are the effects of reproductive selection on the height of
   women.      We thus see that the effect is to render women less
   variable, and to raise their mean height.          The quantities are very
   small, but it must be remembered that the process is secular. Thus,
   supposing reproductive selection to have been unchecked by natural
   selection,   say, for forty generations, the mean height of women,
   neglecting small quantities of the second order, would have been
   raised about 3^ inches.     A factor which would alter stature by about
   3 inches in 10U0 years is olearly capable of producing very consider
   able results in the long periods during which evolution may be sup
   posed to have been at work.        In the case of both mean and standard
   deviation the changes from wives to daughters (0-25" and 0'044")
   are, in the only statistics at present available, far more considerable
   than the above values; but,s it must be remembered, that other
   causes than reproductive selection are at work, such as shrinkage
   with age and the greater physical training of the young women of
   to-dny.
      (5)  I  have only been able to measure, so far, the actual value of
   the correlation between fertility and any organ in the case of stature
   in women.      It would, doubtless, be more sensible in other cases, e.g.,
   pelvic measurements.       But there are certain considerations which
   may be referred to here, and which will suggest how important — at
   any rate in the case of man — it is to take into consideration the
   influence of reproductive selection.
      From considering the fertility of man, in England and in Denmark,
   I conclude that 25 per cent. of the mated population produce one-
   half the next generation. This is the gross fertility. Allowing for
   the selective death-rate — which I knew only for Denmark — 27 per
   cent. of the mated population produced half the next generation.         In
   other words, although natural selection tends to counteract reproduc
   tive selection by a death-rate which, it may be shown, rises continu
   ously and uniformly with increased fertility, yet, in the case of civilised
   man, it is totally ineffectual as against reproductive selection.    If we
   allow for the portion of the population which remains       unmarried,   we
   are well within the mark if we say that less than 25 per cent. of one
*\ generation produce more than half of the next generation. Correla

tion, therefore, between fertility and any mental or physical charac
teristic mast work a progressive change.
   We know that there are very considerable race and class differences
in the matter of fertility. It is very difficult to understand how these
could have arisen by the action of natural selection combined with
heredity, unless either (1) fertility be inherited, or (2) fertility and
some inherited mental or physical characteristic be correlated. Bat
either (1) or (2) involves reproductive selection. We have seen that
there     is evidence of correlation between the stature of women and
their fertility. There is also evidence of a correlation between fertility
and class. Taking Copenhagen, for which alone we have satisfactory
class-fertility statistics, it is possible to show :
      (i) That   the gross fertility of the artisan is more than the gross
            fertility of the professional classes,
      (ii) That the net fertility of the artisan is less than the net fertility
            of the professional classes.
Thus natural selection, at first sight, checks reproductive selection,
greater fertility connoting a greater death-rate ; but we find :
  (iii) That the marriage-rate of the artisan is          so much higher than
            the marriage-rate  of the professional classes, that the per
            centage fertility of the former considerably exceeds that of
            the latter.
  Thus, while a selective death-rate checks      reproductive selection as
between      class and class, a selective
                                       marriage-rate again places repro
ductive selection at an advantage as compared with natural selection ;
the population would accordingly appear to be ultimately, and in the
long run, reproducing itself from the artisan classes.
  I   hope, later, to publish the analysis, curves, and statistics on which
these conclusions are based; at present          I
                                              only wish to draw attention
to the general result : that reproductive selection — at any rate in
civilised man — seems a factor of evolution equipotent to natural
selection,    if,
               indeed,     be not prepotent.

  out that a marked diurnal periodicity characterises the after-shocks
  of great earthquakes in Japan.
     The results of twenty-six registers obtained by means of con
  tinuously recording instruments in Japan, the Philippine Islands,
  and Italy are subjected to harmonic analysis with the following
  conclusions : —
     (1) The reality of the diurnal variation of earthquake-frequency
  seems to be proved by the approximate agreement in epoch (mean
  local time) of the first four components (24, 12, 8, and 6 hours) for
  the whole year at Tokio and Manila, and for the winter and summer
  halves of the year at Tokio.
     (2) In ordinary earthquakes, there is in nearly every case a
  marked diurnal period, the maximum generally occurring between
  10 a.m. and noon.    The semi-diurnal period, though less prominent,
  is also clearly marked, the maximum occurring as a rule between
  9 a.m. and noon and between 9 p.m. and midnight.         Other minor
  harmonic components are also occasionally important, the first maxi
  mum of the eight-hour component probably occurring about 6.30 a.m.,
  and that of the six-hour component abont 3 or 4 a.m. ; but for these
  two epochs the results are not always concordant.
     (3) Though the materials are insufficient for any general conclu
  sion, the weaker shocks seem to be subject to a more marked diurnal
  periodicity.
     (4) In the case of after-shocks of great earthquakes, the diurnal
  periodicity is as a rule strongly pronounced. The maximum of the
  diurnal period occurs within a few hours after midnight, but the
  epochs of the other components are subject to wide variation, possibly
  on account of the short intervals over which the records extend.     A
  special feature of after-shocks is the prominence of the eight-hour
  and four-hour components.
     The epochs of the first four components representing the diurnal
  variation of seismic frequency are compared in several cases with
  those for barometric pressure and wind velocity. While the variation
  of the former cannot be attributed exclusively to either of the latter
  phenomena, it seems not improbable that the diurnal periodicity of
  ordinary earthquakes may be due chiefly to that of wind velocity, and
  the diurnal periodicity of after-shocks chiefly to that of barometric
  pressure.

      trical Changes a Measure of Physico-chemical                Change."
      By Augustus D. Waller, M.D., F.K.S.
                                  (Abstract.)
   The present investigation arises from experiments undertaken to
determine autographically the varying relations between the magni
tude of electrical change and the magnitude of stimulation in nerve
under various chemical conditions.*
   The main principle upon which the inquiry is based is the proposi
tion established (by du Bois-Reymond, and by Hermann in particular)
to the effect that disturbed protoplasm is electro-negative to the
normal.     An accessory principle to which reference will also be
made, is that upheld (by Hering in particular) to the effect that
protoplasm in which disturbance has just ceased is electro-positive
to the normal.
   In accordance with the first principle, injured is electro-negative
to normal protoplasm, and excited is electro-negative to resting proto
plasm.
   In accordance with the second principle, recently excited is electro
positive to normal protoplasm.
   Nerve (the excised and still-living nerve of the frog) is, for the
purpose of this inquiry, considered as a convenient strand of excit
able yet hardly exhaustible protoplasm, giving off to the galvanometer
a demarcation or injury current (Hermann) from a less disturbed
portion (longitudinal surface L) to a more disturbed portion (trans
verse section T), which current, during disturbance of the whole

  nerve effected by weak tetanisation at the two exciting electrodes
  e, e, but principally affecting a lesS disturbed portion L, undergoes it
  negative variation (dn Bois-Reymond), the magnitude of which is
  taken as the index to the magnitude of chemico-physical change
  aroused in the nerve under various chemical conditions.
      Care is observed to avoid the ordinary fallacies, and to obtain
  a " negative variation " as far as possible clear of electrotonic
  effects.      Action-currents (significant of physiological effects in nerve)
  are distinguished from physical effects by means of anaesthetics,
  CO^EtACHCl,.*
      The physiological state of the nerve is tested by tetanising currents
  of low and uniform intensity, of uniform duration                 (7^ and later 15
  seconds), at uniform intervals (1 minute), in both directions.                 The
  series of negative variations or action currents led off to the galva
  nometer, gives a corresponding series of deflections which are regis
  tered on a slowly descending photographic plate.
      The plan of procedure adopted throughout has been to take for a
  period a normal series of deflections, then to submit the nerve to
  the action of a reagent (without removal from the electrodes in the
  case of gases, but with such removal in the case of solutions), finally
   to take for a further period the series of increasing or decreasing
   or reversed deflections of the chemically modified nerve. Altera
   tions of resistance were controlled by aid of a standard deflection of
   O'OOl volt let into the nerve and galvanometer circuit at beginning
   and end of experiment.
      The results so far acquired may be considered under the following
   heads    : —
      1.  The effects of anaesthetics, and of some gases.
      2.  The effects of several chemical substances in solution.
      3. The effect of carbon dioxide.
      4. Theoretical considerations.
      1. Anesthetic vapours were employed at the outset of these ob
   servations with a view of distinguishing between physiological and
   physical effects.     Their action was subsequently studied in detail,
   more especially as regards the comparison between ether and chloro
   form (and other chloromethanes and chloroethanes) upon living
   matter as represented by nerve.f
      Ether vapour (Et3O ; also EtCI, EtBr, and EtI) produces a more
   or less prolonged abolition followed by complete recovery of excit
   ability.
      Chloroform vaponr (CHC13 ; also other chloromethanes and chloro
   ethanes) produces still more prolonged and frequently final aboli
   tion.

   Small quantities of ether and of chloroform vapour produce tem
porary augmentation of excitability.
    C03 assists the anaesthetic and counteracts the toxic action of
CHCI3.
    Oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide cause
little or no effect.
   Methane produces augmentation, hydrocyanic acid abolition.
    Carbon dioxide in small quantity causes primary augmentation, in
large quantity primary abolition or diminution, followed by secondary
augmentation.
              2. Action of Reagents Soluble  in Normal Saline.
   The nerve is bathed for 1 minute in more or less dilute solutions
(acids, alkalis, neutral salts) and replaced upon the electrodes.
    Distilled water gradually abolishes excitability.
   Dilute acid solutions, M/40 to M/10, cause primary augmentation,
followed by gradual diminution.
   Stronger acid solutions, M/10 to M/5, cause primary diminution
and abolition.
   The effect of an acid follows acidity rather than avidity, but is
also specific.
   Decinormal     acetic, nitric, and sulphuric acids have approximately
equal effects.
   As compared with the action of N/10 HN03, or H3S04, the action
of oxalic acid is less marked, that of phosphoric acid much less
marked ; that of lactic acid, on the other hand, is more marked.
Approximately equal effects are produced by N/10 nitric, N/5 phos
phoric, and N/20 lactic.
   Alkalis. — Caustic potash is far more active than caustic soda.
Potassium salts are more active than sodium salts.
   Neutral Salts. — With the view of ascertaining how far the action
of a neutral salt depends upon its acid or its basic moiety, the follow
ing tabular comparison was effected,
                       NH.C1.        NH.Br.     NHJ.
                         NaCl.        NaBr.       Nal.
                          KC1.         KBr.        KI.
From which is concluded that the influence of the base predominates
in a total action due to the entire molecule.
    Many other salts have been tested, among which may be mentioned
those of calcium and of mercury.
    Calcium chloride in M/10 solution augments the electrical response,
and antagonises potassium chloride, which diminishes or abolishes it.

     Mercuric    chloride is the most lethal of any salts hitherto tested ;
 its M/100 solution abolishes the response.
     Isomeric compounds differ in efficacy.
     Of the three dioxybenzenes, pyrocatechin is the most and hydro-
 qninone the least toxic.
     Alkaloids and Narcotic Drugs. — The most obviously effective, so far,
 have been cocaine, physostigmine, and aconitine (chloral hydrate
 and butyl chloral hydrate) ; the most ineffective morphia, atropine,
 muscarine.
     Extract of opium is more effective than tartrate of morphia.
     Aconitine hydrochlorate is more effective than aconine, or pyra-
 conitine, or pseudaconitine, or benzaconine ; and there is a close
 resemblance between the effects of aconitine and of acetic acid,
 attributable to the acetyl group.
          3. Action of COa on Nerve and Production          of COt by Nerve.
     Carbon dioxide, the chief terminal product of protoplasmic action,
 has been the object of detailed investigation, more especially with
 reference to the question of its production during the excited activity
 of nerve.*
     A small amount of COt — such as is contained in e.g., expired air —
causes a marked augmentation of the negative variation.                An isolated
 nerve acts thus as an indicator of the presence of COa.
     From which it was argued that if any CO3 is produced within the
active (tetanised) nerve, a similar augmentation should occur. This
has since been verified under various conditions.
     The evidence is extended by further experiments on nerve in
various stages, giving various kinds of electrical response to the
same kind of excitation.
    An isolated nerve (in autumn and early winter) considered with
reference to its freshness presents three stages, in which the electrical
response is as follows : —
        I. A  predominant negative effect.
      II.     „        „      positive after-effect.
    III.     „         „         „      effect.

                                 CO3, and of tetanisation lasting five minutes,
npon nerve in these three states are as follows : —
       I.  Augmentation of negative deflection.
      II.  Appearance of negative deflection.
    III.   Substitution of negative for positive deflection, or diminution
             of positive deflection.

       The Photographic Values of Moonlight and Starlight
       compared with the Light of a Standard Candle."                  By
       Captain W. DE W. Abney, C.B., R.E., F.R.S.               Received
       March 3. 1896.
   Estimations of the visual values of moonlight and starlight by
several observers are extant, but, as might be expected, they vary
considerably from each other, more particularly when they are
referred to such a variable standard as sunlight.       For instance, the
light   of  the moon   is said by  Wollaston    to be roughly   ¥6^6*6 of
that of the sun ; by Bouguer, to be stjtlWs- Probably Zollner's esti
mate    is a fair one, he taking it as   aTwnTy that of sunlight.   As far
as   I  am   aware, the photographic      values of moonlight and star
light have not been recorded with        any great precision, and   I now
offer some determinations which         I   have made under favourable
circumstances, and referred them        to the British standard candle,
•which, though occasionally showing variation in the light it emits,
yet can be utilised when care is taken to check the results by a
reference to a standard such as a Siemens amyl acetate lamp, which
is extremely constant. My first recent attempt at measuring the
value of moonlight was made at Chamounix in the early part of
January, 1895. At that time the sky was cloudless, but on some
few occasions there was a very slight mist in the valley which pre
cluded any great degree of accuracy from being attained on those
nights, and further, as    I  was obliged to leave for England before
full moon, the observations I made there are necessarily incomplete
so far as the object I had in view is concerned.          I  have thought
it worth while to give two examples of these observations, how
ever, to show how necessary       it is that both sky and atmosphere
should be perfectly clear from any mist or haze.        I   may state that
when the observations were made there was about 45° (F.) of frost.
The method of observation that was adopted was as follows : — A
scale of graduated opacity was prepared on a photographic plate by

1896.]      of Moonlight and Starlight compared with Candle.           315
giving it varying lengths of exposure to    a source of light on different
small square areas of the plate ; on development with the ferrous
oxalate developer a scale of graduated opacities was obtained which
'were carefully measured by the method I have already described in
my paper " On the Transmission of Sunlight through the Earth's
Atmosphere" ('Phil. Trans. ,' 1891). Visually, the measurements
of this scale were very good as circumstantial evidence proved,
bat it remained    to determine whether the silver opacities were more
or   less opaque  to the rays used in photography than they were to
the eye. Four scales of gradation had been made on the same plate,
by giving exposures for the same time to four distinct squares of the
plate, another exposure was made on another four distinct squares,
and so on ; so that eventually, on development, four complete scales
of similar gradation were prepared — all being developed together.
Each scale was measured and found to be practically the same. The
four scales were then separated.     Platinum paper was placed behind
each, and they were severally placed accurately at such distances
from the positive pole of the electric arc light that the illumination of
the paper, after passing through a square of different density on each
scale, should, according to the eye measurements, be the same.          If
the photographic      and visual opacities were the same, then, on
illuminating the four scales which, of course, were fixed normally
to the line joining them and the carbon points, the amount of
platinum black deposited, after treatment with oxalate of potash,
should be the same on the part of papers covered by these squares
whose transparency was being tested.
    Several experiments carried out in this way showed conclusively
that the opacities, visual and photographic, were the same. In no
case was there a variation from the calculated opacity of 2 per cent.
It may therefore be taken that the scale of gradation used in the
moonlight and starlight measurements will allow intensities of photo
graphic light to pass through in the same proportion that it does visual
light. For convenience, the transparencies of the different squares of
the scale were calculated out in powers of 2, for          I have shown
elsewhere that, by using intensities of light acting on a plate in a
geometrical series for abscissae,    and making the measured trans
parencies the ordinates, a curve is produced which is, for a consider
able distance, practically a straight line. For checking the results of
measurement it thus becomes of great use.           Moreover, this plaii
enables us to use a much greater range of exposure for diagrammatic
purposes than is practicable if such range is expressed as an arith
metical scale. Hence its adoption for the experiments to be described.
   It must be remembered that there are two ways of giving varying
exposure to light, one by using a constant source of illumination, and
varying the time of exposure, the other by exposing for a constant
   VOL   nx.                                                     z

time and altering the intensity of the light acting. Thus we may
place an amyl acetate lamp or a candle 16 feet away from a sensi
tive surface, and expose different small portions of the plate for 2, 4,
8, 16, &c, seconds; or we may place the amyl acetate lamp at 1, 2,
4, 8, &c., feet away from the plate, and, after each move, expose a
different portion of the plate for, say, 20 seconds.          Up till recently
it has been held that the resulting chemical action is the same in
both instances, so long as the " time x " intensity
                                               "               "

so that an exposure to a light 10 feet away from the plate for
10 seconds effects the same chemical decomposition of the sensitive
salt as an exposure of 1000 seconds when the lamp is placed
100 feet away.        This   I  have shown in the ' Proceedings of the
                                                      '
                                     '
Royal Society,' and in the Photographic                 and ' Camera Club '
Journals, to be wide of the mark if the sensitive surfaces are what
we may call slow, though it is practically the case when using rapid
plates. (It should be remarked that for printing-out processes this
variation has not so far been found.)          This was a point to which my
attention  was   necessarily   directed,  and  the readiest means of proving
if the plates to be employed were suitable, was not only to expose
through the scale of opacities, but subsequently to impress on the
same plate a scale obtained by exposures to a fixed source of light
but with varying times. If when plotted the two curves were identical
or parallel, the proof was sufficient to show that the plates might be
safely employed without any error creeping in.                For it may be
remarked    that  the straight part    in what   we may  call the " intensity "
curve is, in a slow plate, always less steep than in the time curve.
With the plates that were used the " time " and " intensity " curves
were found to fulfil the condition of parallelism.

    The accompanying figure is from a photograph of an exposure to
moonlight and candlelight through the scale of opacities, and of a
-"time "scale made with an amyl acetate lamp. This will indicate
the method which was adopted better than a verbal explanation.
    I   is the time scale, the exposures being made to an amyl acetate
lamp at a convenient distance.
     II  is the exposure to candlelight through a graduated scale.
     III   is exposure to moonlight through the same graduated scale.

 Apart of the two curves is 2'3, that is, the light of the moon on this
 occasion was 2a-3 = 4'95 times less photographically bright than that
 of a candle at 5 feet distance, or was equal to one standard candle at
  •very     nearly 10 feet, or closely 0'01 standard candle at 1 foot
 distance. As the exposure to the candlelight was only two-thirds oE
  that to the moon, this result must be reduced accordingly.                  On this
 occasion there was a slight ground haze ; the low results are due
  largely to the atmospheric absorption.
      The results have been given in standard candles (which we will
  in future designate as S.C.).               The value of the paraffin candle
  employed was compared photographically                    by employing each to

power was first of all compared, and at the distances where they
balanced one another, the exposure to the plate was given.
    The paraffin candle employed was found to bo 1-085 of the standard
candle.     The exposures were given to the plate at 10 feet and
9 '6 feet respectively.

   When the curves are plotted, it will be found that they are at such
a distance apart that the light of the paraffin candle is photographic
ally 1-21 times more luminous than that of the standard candle,
though visually they had the same illuminating value on the screen.
All results obtained with the paraffin candle have therefore to be
increased in that proportion to bring them into the values of standard
candles.

     Not having an opportunity to make a measurement of the light at

remarkably free from baze. The moon was fall on February 9 at
'r,.23 p.m.  An exposure was made on February 8 at 7.30 p.m. at
South Kensington, and another at 10.5 p.m. on February 9, near-
Wimbledon, away from buildings of any importance.          These two
localities were chosen to see if the country gave results differing
from those obtained in town. At 7.30 on February 8 the altitude of
the moon was 35°, so that the light had 1*7 atmospheres to traverse.
At 10.5 p.m. in Wimbledon it had an altitude of 43°, so the light had
to traverse but 1*45 atmospheres.
    The results arrived at show that the night at Wimbledon on this
particular occasion was clearer than at Kensington, even allowing
for the absorption of the atmosphere. Tn my paper " On the Trans
mission of Sunlight through the Earth's Atmosphere," it was shown
that the exponential coefficient of absorption in the clearest atmo
sphere was 0'340 for the rays affecting the silver salt employed, and
adopting this it will be seen that thero must have been a greater
haze in London than at Wimbledon.        That this is not always the
case is shown that in measurements of starlight the two give identical
results on the same night.

    Plotting these curves as before, we find that they are 3.1 apart ;
 that is, that moonlight is 23.1 = 10-7 times more intense than the
 candle at 7 feet. Moonlight was therefore equal to 1 S.C. at 194 feer.,
 or was equal to 0'266 S.C. at 1 foot. We thus find that the moon at
 the fall is equal to 0'266 S.C. in its action on a bromide plate. In
 the paper already referred to it was shown that when measuring
 different intensities on a plate, the integral increase in effect of white
 light increases in the same ratio as does the intensity of a part of the
 spectrum whose wave-length is at the maximum part of the curve
 of sensitiveness. With these plates the point of maximum sensitive
 ness is about X 4450.
    Taking Zollner's visual measure of moonlight, he found it to be
 about 0-012 candle at 1 foot. Sunlight, reduced in brightness to
 visual equality, I have found on a bright, clear day in summer,
 near midday, to have a photographic value 285 times greater than
 that of an amyl acetate lamp flame, and that a standard candle of
 equal visual intensity has a photographic intensity of 1-1 times that
 of an amyl acetate flame.           This makes sunlight to have a photo
 graphic intensity, the        visual  intensities being equal, of very nearly
 26 times that of a standard candle.             As moonlight is reflected sun
 light, it may bo presumed that the two have the same quality.               If
 this be so, we should arrive at moonlight, being 0'01 visually of a
 standard candle, the moon being at the full, a value which is near
 that given above.         This mode of comparison must necessarily be
  only approximate, on account of the variable nature of sunlight, and
  therefore of moonlight.

 322      Capt. W. de W. Abney.             Photographic        Values    [Mar. 19,
    It may be asked whether there are good grounds for presuming
 that the standard candle was emitting the same amount of light on
 the occasions quoted.         There can be little doubt that it was, as on
 every plate was impressed a "time" scale by exposure to an amyl-
 acetate lamp.       A comparison of this with the scale given by exposure
 to the candle showed that any variation was negligible.
    We next have to consider the photographic value of total starlight.
 It appeared to me that the fairest way of arriving at it would be to
 expose a plate through the graduated scale to the action of the light
 in a horizontal position. This would practically be the illumination
of a piece of white paper laid in that position.               The great point was
to get a clear horizon, or at all events an horizon which was not
obstructed to any great extent by any adjacent tree or building. The
top of South Kensington Museum answers to the necessary condi
tions, as it is higher than any close building, except the Natural
History Museum towers, and these are at a considerable distance.
At Wimbledon also it was possible to expose a plate with advantage,
though the horizon was not absolutely clear from the spot which was
available.      Exposures were made at both places, and the highest
value at South Kensington agreed with the highest value at Wimble
don ; it is therefore unnecessary to give the latter. It should be noted
that it is a decided advantage to have more than one graduated scale
bearing identical opacities, as it enables simultaneous exposures to be
given at different localities.
   The results of two exposures will be given, as the others do not
differ widely from them.

   These two curves are practically identical, hence we may take it
that on this night exposure to starlight for 30 minutes was equal to
exposure to the candle for 1 minute at a distance of 7 feet, that is,
starlight is equal to one S.C. at 34-8 feet, or to 0-000825 candle (S.C)
at' 1 foot.   The variation may be due to two causes — (1) the state of
the atmosphere, or (2) to the difference in heavens ; the first is most
probable.     It may be interesting to know that photographic trans
parencies from negatives were made by contact during these expo
sures of the scale.          In all cases there was evidence of considerable
over-exposure in the starlight.
   It has been stated that in order to ascertain that the candle was
giving the normal illumination for the observations by moonlight,
comparisons of its light were made with a standard amyl acetate
lamp.     This comparison was also made on these occasions.
   We may now compare the light of the full moon with that of the
stars. Fig. 3 gives a map of the stars with the planets Jupiter,
Mars, and Neptune shown in position for the last exposure.                   The

positions on the first night differ so little from it that it is unneces
sary to repeat the chart. I have to thank the Astronomer Royal for
these charts, he kindly having had them prepared for me from
 Phillips' atlas.   I have, however, reduced them from the elliptical
 form to that of a circular disc.
                                   Kig.  3.
    The light from Jupiter has been estimated, and it would not be
far wrong to assume that it is equivalent to a candle placed at
800 feet from the screen.     It may, therefore, be neglected in taking
into account the light from the stars, and much more so may Mars
and Neptune.      It must be recollected that the exposure was made to
the plate in a horizontal position.     If the stars were uniformly dis
tributed in the hemisphere the measured light would be but half of
the actual light, since it would strike the plate at an angle, except
at the zenith. Besides this, however, we have to take into account
the atmospheric absorption, and taking the most favourable coefficient
for the plates used we shall find that only about 25 per cent, of uni
formly distributed starlight would be effective.     Total starlight would
thus be 4 x 0'001515 or 0'006 standard candle at 1 foot distant from
the screen.    Taking moonlight as 0'266 of a standard candle, we find

189l».]        Helium, a Gaseous    Constituent  of certain Minerals.      325
lhat moonlight is        44 times brighter than starlight when unabsorbed
by    more    than  1  atmosphere, and if uniformly distributed, though, for
illumination of a horizontal screen, it is 175 times brighter so far as
photographic action is concerned.         If we take the visual quality of the
two lights to be the same, these figures should bear the same propor
tion for visual observation. If moonlight be O'Ol candle at 1 foot
distance, starlight will be 0000057 candle at the same distance, that
is, the visual value of one candle at nearly 132 feet distant from a
screen. With an intensity of about G/1000000 of candle placed at
 1 foot from a screen, or about 10 times less illumination thau the
above, the screen would be invisible. It follows that the actual
illumination given by starlight will be less than that stated.
                          Addendum.     March 25, 16%.
     I ought    to have drawn attention to the fact that though the above
comparison of moonlight with starlight was taken from actual observa
tions,     it would not    have been unfair to have     deduced the value of
moonlight        as observed   at Wimbledon   with  the  moon in the zenith.
From the observations made and recorded in my paper on the
" Transmission of Sunlight through the Earth's Atmosphere," the
coefficient of absorption fi for the rays affecting the bromo-iodide of
silver can be shown to be 0'340, under the very favourable circum
stances under which the exposures were given. As the rays of the
 moon had to traverse 1*45 atmosphere, and then showed a photo
graphic illuminating power of 0'266 S.C. ; had they only had to
traverse a thickness of 1 atmosphere, this number would have been
0-308 S.C.         This last value would have been equivalent to a visual
estimation of moonlight of closely 0'012 S.C. at 1 foot. Starlight
would have then been rather more than 200 times less bright than tho
light of the full moon.

        of Chemistry in University College, London.                Received

    § 1.    In  the  original notice of this gas (' Proc. Roy. Soc.,' vol.  58,
 p.  81), it was stated that the gas obtained from cleveite contained
 pome, but not much, nitrogen, and no hydrogen.            I have since pre
 pared samples from broggerite, samarskite, and fergusouite, and              I
 hnd that in all eases the gas evolved on heating the mineral in a
vacuum is rich in hydrogen ; the amount of nitrogen is in all cases

infinitesimal.   This was easily ascertained from experiments made
on the spectra of mixtures of gases by Dr. Collie and myself.
 About 001 per cent, of nitrogen is still risible ; and the hig-her
the pressure the more easily is the spectrum of nitrogen seen when
it is mixed with helium. With these new samples of gas, the
nitrogen spectrum was just visible at a pressure of 4 or 5 mm. ;
and that implies that only the minutest trace can have been present.
It doubtless comes off the glass tubes in which the powdered minerals
were heated, or it may have adhered to the surface of the powdered
mineral.    I think it may be safely assumed that nitrogen is not a
normal constituent of these minerals.      There was always a consider
able amount of carbon dioxide evolved, and, as the carbon spectrum
persisted even after the gas had been passed through soda-lime,
probably a hydrocarbon, but this only in minute amount.
    § 2. The yield from these sources was very variable.       Whereas
 1 gram of cleveite yielded 7-2 c.c. of helium, 1 gram of broggerite
yielded somewhat less than 1 c.c. of helium ; the yield from samarskite
was still less, about 0-6 c.c. per gram ; and from fergusonite   l'l c.c.
per gram, the last by heating alone ; with the other minerals, the
residue after heating was fused with hydrogen potassium sulphate.
 There can be no doubt that cleveite is far the best source of the gas,
 but unfortunately it is very scarce.
    § 3. Dr. Collie, to whom   I owe thanks for helping to extract these
 gases, was so good as to analyse the gas obtained from fergusonite on
 heating. It contained
                Hydrogen                     54-7 per cent.

 No hydrocarbons were present, for, after explosion with oxygen, n      •
 contraction occurred on admitting potash ; the residue gave a spectrum
free from nitrogen flutings even when the pressure was compara
 tively high.
    The carbon dioxide was absorbed by soda-lime, and the remaining
 mixture was then circulated over the usual purifiers — red-hot copper
 oxide, soda-lime, phosphoric anhydride, and red-hot magnesium.
 Although no nitrogen was present, magnesium was introduced as a
 precautionary measure.

0'0212 c.c. The weight of the empty bulb was therefore increased by
0'000026 gram. The concordance between the mean of the determi
nations of the density of argon, 19-941, made with this bulb, and that
found by Lord Rayleigh with one of 2 litres capacity, 19'94, shows
that it is possible to obtain accurate results by its use.

   § 7. Gas was prepared from 500 grams of fergusonite.       This time
no drying tubes or tubes filled with soda-lime were interposed between
the tube containing the mineral and the pump.      There was a vacuum
tube, as usual, on the way to the pump, into which samples of the
gas could be introduced and examined at any desired pressure.         The
object of this was to make sure that no unknown gas was being
rejected owing to its absorption by soda or anhydride.       The result
proved the precaution to have been quite unnecessary. Every line
visible was identified as belonging to hydrogen, carbon, carbon
dioxide, the oxygen of water vapour, or helium.     It may he taken as
certaiu that no gas capable of absorption is evolved from this mineral,
and it is exceedingly improbable that any gas has been overlooked
which finds its sourco in other minerals.
   The gas from fergusonite was treated with caustic soda to remove
carbon dioxide, and circulated over the usual absorbent till the
hydrogen spectrum disappeared, and its density was determined.

reason to suspect a slight leakage.

    Assuming a possible error of 0'2 milligram in weighing the globe
  (and this error is certainly too high), the error might amount to
  0014.
     It appears  to me that these numbers         furnish some ground for tho

  830     Lord Blythswood.      On the Reflection   of RCmtgen   [Mar. 19,
  supposition that, as suggested by Lockyer and by Runge and Paschen,
  the helium from various sources is not quite homogeneous, but that
 different samples differ slightly in density.    I think that these num
  bers point to a possible division into groups.      The gas from brog
  gerite appears to have the density 2'18, that from samarskite 2-12,
 and that from fergusonite 2-14.     But the evidence is slender. It is
 not impossible that the gas from cleveite is lighter ; it is unfortunate
 that the sample of cleveite gas was lost ; but its mixture with that
 from broggerite weighs less than the gas from broggerite alone.
     It has not, I think, been noticed that the light emitted from a
 vacuum-tube containing cleveite gas has a richer orange-yellow shade
 than is shown by gas from broggerite, samarskite, and fergusonite.
 This is doubtless due to a greater intensity of the red line; but there
 is another difference.     The cleveite gas shows, in addition to the
 usual strong lines, a set of fairly strong lines between the very strong
 green,- and the strong blue.    These lines have never been observed in
 samples   of gas from broggerite, samarskite, or fergusonite, no matter
 how high or low the pressure in the tube, or the intensity of the dis
 charge. Bnt the difference of colour is so marked that it is easy, at
 a glance, to say whether any tube contains cleveite-helium, or helium
 from another mineral.
     Taking the two lines of evidence together, they undoubtedly
 strengthen each other, and    I am at present engaged in an attempt to
 fractionate the mixed gases from broggerite, samarskite, and ferguso
 nite into two or more portions.
     Mention should perhaps be made, in conclusion, of Langlet's deter

 capacity, was 2.00.    His sample was examined spectroscopically, and
 appears to have been free from nitrogen and hydrogen. It is unlikely
 that he can have made an error of 1-3 milligrams in weighing,
 especially as he determined the density three separate times. It is
 not impossible, therefore, that he had under his hands gas much
 richer in some light constituent than it has been my fortune to fall
in with. Whether this is the case or not, further research must
show.

   Rontgen, in (7) and (8) of his original paper,* described experi
ments seeming to prove the X rays to be incapable of regular
reflection.   He pointed out that the result of his experiment in (8) ,
seeming possibly due to regular reflection, might be explained
otherwise.     Communications to the French Academy of Sciences, by
lmbert and Bertin-Sans (March 2, ' Comptes Rendns,' pp. 524, 525)
and Battelli and Garbasso (March 9, ' Comptes Rendus,' p. 603)
refer to experiments proving not regular reflection, as from a polished

suggested in letters which       I  have received from him in the last few
days, might either be due, as indicated by MM. lmbert and Bertin-
Sans, to the reflecting surface, though polished for ordinary light,
being rugged for light of the exceedingly short wave-length which
may be attributed with probability to the Rontgen X rays ; or else
to a sort of phosphorescence, or possibly fluorescence, with regard to
X light, produced in the substance of the mirror. One, and only one,
of the photographs described in Lord Blythswood's communica
tion, seems possibly decisive in proving regular reflection from the
polished speculum-metal which he used. I enclose a copy of it, which
may be clearer than that which accompanies his paper. In this
I  see quite clearly a straight line, with its two ends next the letters

       bridge.       Communicated by Professor J. J. THOMSON,
       F.R.S. Received March 3, 1896.
    § 1. The experiments described       in this communication were made
 iu the Cavendish Laboratory of the University of Cambridge, at
 Professor J. J. Thomson's suggestion, in order to find -whether the
 contact potential of a pair of plates of different metals is in any way
affected by the passage of the Rontgen " X

 plates.
    § 2.  The vacuum bulb and induction coil for the production of the
 rays  were   enclosed in a box lined with metal, so that the plates and
 the apparatus used in measuring their contact potential difference
 should be screened from any direct electrical disturbances.        At one
 side of the box there was a circular hole of about 3 cm. in diameter.
 The vacuum bulb was placed just inside this hole, and directed so
 that the rays should stream out through it in a direction perpen
 dicular to the side of the box       In some experiments this hole was
closed by    a  tinfoil screen, which   allowed a large proportion of the
rays to pass out while shutting in ordinary electrical disturbances.
 The plates whose contact potential difference was to be measured
were placed at a short distance outside the box, in such a position
that the rays could fall on them.

    § 4.  To measure their contact potential, I used the null method
described by Lord Kelvin in his paper given to the British Associa
 tion in 1880.       I shall not describe this method in detail in tho present
 communication, but may mention that the value of the contact poten
 tial is found by measuring the amount of the counter potential
 which has to be applied to the pair of plates to reduce the potential
 difference between their opposing surfaces to zero.                        The counter
 potential introduced to effect this annulment must obviously be equal
 and opposite to their contact potential difference.
    Hence the numerical value of the latter is simply that of the
 applied counter potential, but is of opposite sign.
    § 5. The plates were of ziuc and tinfoil, the latter being mounted on
 thin ebonite to keep it flat. They were placed parallel to one another at
 a small distance apart, so that tho rays fell perpendicularly on the back
 of the tinfoil plate, passed through it and the airspace between them,
 and were absorbed by the zinc. The tinfoil plate was insulated and
 connected to the insulated quadrants of a Kelvin quadrant electro
  meter.    The zinc was uninsulated, and was connected to the unin

 1896.]        X Rays  on the Contact    Electricity of Metals.         335
sulated quadrants of the electrometer. This plate is movable in a
direction perpendicular to its plane, and can thus be drawn away
from the tinfoil. If there is any electric potential difference
between the opposing surfaces of the two plates, further separa
tion causes a change in it which, reacting on the electrometer,
deflects it.
   § 6. When everything was in position, before starting the rays          I
measured the contact potential of the plates by the method mentioned
above, and found it to be
                                + 0-44 volt,
the zinc being positive to the tinfoil. The rays were now turned on,
so as to pass through the tinfoil plate on to the zinc. The contact
potential, measured while the rays were passing, was about
                                 +0-43 volt.
    But before the plates could be separated to     see whether the counter
potential applied  had  annulled  the  contact  potential or not, the charge
leaked away as if the insulation of the tinfoil plate were bad.       Also I
-observed    that when   the plates were not in connexion with one
another, but only with the electrometer, they seemed to act as though
they were connected together by a bad conductor or an electrolyte.
   § 7. The X rays were now turned on so as to pass perpendicularly
through the tinfoil plate on to the zinc. In a few minutes the deflec
tion indicated
                                 -0-50 volt.
and remained steady there for several minutes. While in this con
dition I separated the plates. The deflection increased by a small
amount, showing that the electrolytic power of the air while the rays
are passing through it had somewhat more than counterbalanced the
contact potential of the plates, and had established a slight difference
of potential in the direction opposite to that which exists between
the surfaces of the plates when connected metallically in air. This
was confirmed by a measurement, made immediately after, by the
null method, which gave
                                 -t-0,44 volt
for the potential difference between the plates     ; the rays not being on
at  the time.
    § 8. In  the experiments described above, the rays had fallen per
pendicularly on the plates, passing through the tinfoil (see diagram).
I  now placed them so that the rays should pass between them in a
direction approximately parallel to their surfaces. On breaking the
metallic connexion between the plates and turning on the rays the
-electrometer rose to
                                -0-39 volt,

 and remained steady there.         Separating the plates produced no
 further deflection, which shows that the contact potential difference
 between the surfaces of the plates has been reduced to zero.      This is
 confirmed by the measurement, made by the null method, of their
 contact potential, which is now
                                 + 0-39 volt.
    § 9. In the  above   experiment the plates were at about one centi
metre apart.       I now increased the distance between them to two,
then to five, and then to ten centimetres ; but in spite of the fact
that in the last case the rays must have passed almost entirely
 through the air between the plates without striking on their surfaces,,
the electrometer always crept up from zero to — 039 volt in a minute
or two, and remained almost steady at that value.
   § 10. In the above experiments there was no screen between the
vacuum bulb and the ebonite back of the tinfoil plate. To make
sure that none of the effects observed were due to ordinary electrical
disturbances I now placed a piece of tinfoil, in connexion with the metal
lining of the box containing bulb and coil, over the hole in the box
from which the rays issued.        With the plates parallel to the rays
and at about one centimetre apart the electrometer rose, while the
rays were on, from zero to — 0'39 volt in two minutes and remained
steady there. This shows that the effects above described are due to
the new rays, which can pass with ease through tinfoil, and not to the
more ordinary forms of electric radiation.
   § 11. In order to find whether these phenomena were strictly com
parable with the results which Lord Kelvin had got many years ago
by connecting the plates through an electrolyte,          I made several
experiments     in  which  connexion  was  made  by  a drop of acidulated
water.
   Before doing so, however, I measured their potential difference by
the null method and found it to be
                                + 0-57 volt.
This variation from previous determinations is due no doubt to the
influence of the atmosphere in tarnishing the plates. It is much less>
than the changes, due to that cause, which         I have often found in
other experiments on contact electricity.      I now joined the plates by
a drop of acidulated water while they were in connexion with the
electrometer only. The deflection at once rose from zero to
                                -0-54 volt.
   I  now separated the plates, but this did not cause any notable
change in the deflection, though it tended slightly in the direction
which indicated that the contact potential of the plates had not been.

1896.]       X Rays    on the Contact   Electricity of Metals.       337
quite balanced by the electrolytic action. This is confirmed by the
difference between 057 and — 0'54 given above.  After a short while
the deflection fell to
                               -0-48 volt,
which is nearly the value fouud previously for untarnished zinc and
tinfoil in air, showing that the acidulated water has, in all prob
ability, removed the tarnish, and is now balancing the contact
potential between clean surfaces of the metals. The water was now
removed, and the contact potential measured by the null method as
before. It is still
                               + 0-57 volt,
for, of course, by far the greater part of the surfaces of the plates is
still tarnished as before.   In another experiment with a drop of
acidulated water between the plates, I found that the contact poten
tial was more than counter-balanced by the electrolytic action. This
corresponds to the action of the rays mentioned in § 7.
   § 12. It now occurred to me, that perhaps the electrolytic con
nexion established between the plates when the rays were passing
might be through the insulating supports of the tinfoil plate, and
not through the air, as I had hitherto supposed.      To test the truth of
this idea, several variations were made in the arrangements, all with
a view to place the insulators in such a position that the rays could
                          I
not reach them. First, placed a screen of sheet zinc, with a hole in
the middle of    it,between the tinfoil plate and the hole in the box,
from which the rays issue, so that the rays from the negative elec
trode of the vacuum bulb could fall only on the tinfoil plate and not
on its insulating supports.     These, by the way, consisted of pieces of
good red sealing-wax, and, under ordinary conditions, were excellent
insulators. When the rays were started the electrometer moved from
zero to  a position which indicated a difference of potential as great as
or greater than any which had been previously observed.        This shows
that the electrolytic connexion had not been at all affected by screen
ing the solid insulators.
   This experiment was repeated several times, and in every case the
result was the same.      Still further confirmation of the aerial nature
of the connexion was obtained by a great alteration in he length and
position of the insulating support.      Instead of three short arches of
sealing-wax, each made of one stick about      6  inches long,   used one
                                                                 I
tall one fully 12 inches high one leg was attached to the wooden
                                ;
framework on which the uninsulated zinc plate was mounted, and the
other, which was somewhat longer, held the tinfoil plate.        The new
insulator was thus one piece, about 24 inches long, of sealing-wax,
with the greater part far removed from the rays, instead of six
pieces each  3  inches long. A number of experiments were made with

338      Effect of Iivntgeris Rays on Cloudy Condensation.      [Mar. 19,
this arrangement.       In all of them the potential varied under the
influence of the rays by an amount similar in direction and magnitude
to that previously observed.
   § 13.   I have observed that the activity of the vacuum bulb seems
to determine, to some extent, the potential difference observed on the
electrometer ; that is to say, if the rays are very weak and unsteady
 (as judged by the fluorescence of the vacuum bulb) they do not make
the air sufficiently electrolytic to counterbalance the contact potential
difference between the surfaces of the plates. Thus, when the bulb
is not fluorescing brightly and steadily, one gets results which are
uncertain and perplexing. But these appear to give place in all cases
to more definite values whenever the rays are strong and steady.
   § 14. The conclusions I have drawn from these experiments are
that (1) the influence of the rays on the zinc and tinfoil plates does
not cause any direct or sudden change in their contact potential, but
that (2) the air through which the rays pass is temporarily converted
into an electrolyte, and when in this condition forms a connexion
between the plates which has the same properties as a drop of acidu
lated water, namely, it rapidly reduces the potential between the
opposing surfaces of the plates' to zero, and may even reverse it to a
small extent.
   It is interesting to note that this electrolytic property was found by
Lord Kelvin (' Electrostatics and Magnetism,' Art. XXIII, §§ 412 —
414) to be possessed by the fumes from a burning spirit lamp. In
both cases its cause is probably the same. It is, no doubt, due to a
 want of electrical equilibrium among, and a partial dissociation of,
the molecules of the gas.
VI. " The      Effect of Rontgen's Rays on Cloudy Condensation."
        By C. T. R. Wilson, B.Sc. (Vict.), B.A. (Cantab.), Clerk-
        Maxwell Student.         Communicated by Professor J. J.
        Thomson, F.R.S.       Received March 3, 1896.
   In   a paper on " The Formation of Cloud in the Absence of Dust,"
read before the Cambridge Philosophical Society, May 13th, 1895,        I
showed that cloudy condensation takes place in the absence of dust
when saturated air suffers sudden expansion exceeding a certain
critical amount.
   I  find that air exposed to the action of Rontgen's rays requires to
be expanded just as much as ordinary air in order that condensation
may take place, but these rays have the effect of greatly increasing
the number of drops formed when the expansion is beyond that neces
sary to produce condensation.
   Under ordinary conditions, when the expansion exceeds the critical

1896.]         On Turacin and Turacoporphynn in the Blood.           339
value, a shower of fine rain falls, and this settles within a very few
seconds ;  if,  however, the same expansion bo made while the air      is
exposed    to the action of the rays, or immediately after, the drops are
sufficiently numerous to form a fog, which persists for some minutes.
   In order that direct electrical action might be excluded, experi
ments were made with the vessel containing the air wrapped in tin
foil connected to earth. This was exposed to the rays the air was
                                                           ;
then expanded, the current switched off from the induction coil, and
finally the tinfoil removed to examine the cloud formed.
   As before, a persistent fog was produced with an expansion which
without the rays would only have formed a comparatively small
number of drops.
   It seems legitimate to conclude that when the Rontgen rays pass
through moist air they produce a supply of nuclei of the same kind
as those which are always present in small numbers, or at any rate of
exactly equal efficiency in promoting condensation.

which present in the visible spectrum absorption bands not unlike
those of the blood colouring matter) exhibits an absorption band
occupying the position, or possessed of the remarkable intensity, of
the extreme violet band under discussion,   it  seemed as  if the latter
owed   its origin to a group of atoms existing in and perhaps charac

   It occurred to me that it would be extremely interesting to de
termine whether turacin, which, as Professor Church first showTed in
1869,* presents two absorption bands in the visible spectrum, which
have a remarkable resemblance to those of oxy-haemoglobin, would
exhibit in the extreme violet or the ultra-violet, an absorption baud
similar to that of the compounds and certain of the derivatives of the
blood colouring matter.        To my surprise, I discovered that solutions
of turacin in caustic soda or ammonia, so dilute as to be almost
colourless, and to exhibit, when a stratum 10 mm. thick was examined,
only a faint shading in the position of the stronger of the two turacin
bands in the green, absorbed the extreme violet and ultra-violet rays
of the spectrum precisely as highly diluted solutions of the acid
compounds of haematin (e.g., haematin hydrochloride dissolved in
glacial acetic acid). My first observations were made by allowing
the spectrum of a beam of sunlight reflected into the dark room from
the mirror of the heliostat, and which had passed through the solution
of turacin, to fall upon a fluorescent screen of the double cyanide of
platinum and barium, when an intense absorption band at the com
mencement of the ultra-violet was visible to the naked eye.                I  sub
sequently confirmed this observation by taking a series of photographs
of the spectrum, employing solutions of turacin of various degrees of

tions of haem&tin hydrochloride and of turacin is so complete that it
is impossible to distinguish from the photographs of the spectrum
which substance has been employed.
   Solutions of turacin in caustic soda or ammonia, so dilute as to be
almost colourless, and exhibiting, when a stratum 10 mm. thick is
examined, only the faintest shadow in the position of the stronger
of the two turacin bands in the green, exhibit an intense absorption
band which encroaches more and more on tho ultra-violet as the
strength of the solution increases.             With a solution just permitting
the recognition       of   both   the   turacin  bands — the stratum examined
being 10 mm. — the band extends between h and M, the most intense
absorption occurring between h and L. The less refrangible border
of the band is sharply defined, whilst the more refrangible border
is less definite. As the solution is diluted, the band becomes narrower,
through less and less of the ultra-violet rays being absorbed.                    In
highly dilute solutions, the band, which is still intense, absorbs both
H and K.
   Turacin, therefore, like the acid compounds of hoamatin, exhibits
an absorption band, which is exactly on the boundary of the ultra
violet proper, and which extends further and further into the ultra
violet, as the concentration of the solution increases.
   The identity of the spectrum of turacin with that of the haematin
compounds was so complete that it led me to surmise the existence of
a close relationship between the copper-containing body and the colour
ing matter of the blood. Although               I   had ever since their publica
tion been perfectly familiar with Professor Church's first researches,
his second investigation, of which the results were published in 1892,*
was unfortunately unknown to me. Without any knowledge of this
work, in making an oral preliminary communication of my first results
to the International Physiological Congress at Berne, in September,
1895,   I   expressed my conviction that turacin contains the same
atomic group which is the cause of the extreme violet and ultra
violet absorption band in the spectrum of highly dilute solutions of
haemoglobin and its derivatives, and              I  predicted that by removing
the copper from turacin,          I should be able to obtain a turaco-porphyrin
similar to the body which results from the removal of the iron from
hivmatin.       It was only after I had performed the experiments
necessary for the elucidation of this point, and had obtained results
corroborating Professor Church's discovery of turacoporphyrin, that
the fact of his having anticipated me in this matter was brought
under my notice.
   The results of my special work offer, however, an independent and

additional confirmation of his results. I have found that when turacin
is treated with strong sulphuric acid, the resulting turaco-porphyrin
presents in the extreme- violet an intense absorption band, which in
position and characters is identical with that of haematoporphyrin,
obtained by the action of concentrated sulphuric acid or pure haematin
hydrochloride. . In solutions of extreme dilution, this band occupies
the space between h and H. If the solution be slightly more con
centrated K is absorbed, and with increasing concentration of the
solution the absorption of the ultra-violet extends more and more.
    Dr. Archibald Garrod and Mr. Gowland Hopkins, who first brought
under my notice Professor Church's researches on turaco-porphyrin,
have communicated to me the results of their own observations,
which show that alkaline solutions of turaco-porphyrin exhibit, in
respect to the absorption bands in the visible spectrum, slight differ
ences from haematoporphyrin — though the identity of the spectrum
of acid solutions of the two bodies is complete. The facts which                  I
have placed on record in this paper point, however, to the essential
identity of turaco-porphyrin and haematoporphyrin, and when taken
 in connection with the identity of the ultra-violet spectrum of turacin,
and of the acid haematin compounds, appear to mo to establish that
 turacin contains the atomic group, which is the cause of the charac
 teristic extreme violet and ultra-violet absorption exerted by haemo
 globin, its compounds, and principal derivatives.

 published! the same conclusion, and, as a result of a diffusion experi-
 mentj described in their paper, they came to the conclusion that the
 gas giving the line D3 was heavier than the gas giving the line 5015'7.

merits are not yet finished, but the first, which was made on January
22, 1896, seems to leave no doubt on one point of the investigation.
    A fl^be was taken, and at the bend was fixed a plaster of Paris
plug about 1-5 cm. thick ; in one of the limbs two platinum wires
were inserted. The plug was saturated with hydrogen to free it
from air ; the tube was then plunged into a mercury trough, and
fixed upright with the limbs full of mercury.        Into the leg (A) with
the platinum wires a small quantity of hydrogen was passed, and as
soon after as possible another small quantity of a mixture of helium
and hydrogen from samarskite was put up the other limb (B) of the
 H-tube.
     Immediately after the helium was passed into the limb (B), spec
troscopic observations were made of the gas in the limb (A) ; D3 was
already visible, and there was no trace of 5015'7. This result seems to
clearly indicate that if a trne diffusion of one constituent takes place,
the component which gives D3 is lighter than the one which gives the
line at wave-length 5015"7'.
      Although this result is opposed to the statement made by Range and
 Paschen, it is entirely in harmony with the solar and stellar results.
 In support of this I may instance that of the cleveite lines asso
ciated with hydrogen in the chromosphere, and the stars of Group
 III7, those allied to D3 are much stronger than those belonging to
 the series of which hOXh'l forms part.

      The paper contains an investigation into the distribution of electric
 and magnetic forces which are called into play when some electro-
 Tnagnetic systems are made to move with uniform velocity through
 the ether.     Maxwell's theory is employed in obtaining the funda
  mental equations, and it is found that though the electric and
  magnetic forces, E and H, have generally no potential, still they can
  be derived from two functions -fr and Q ; the differential equations
 satisfied by these functions are obtained. The equations are first
 employed to obtain the solution for a moving point-charge, and the
 result is identical with that obtained by Heaviside and J. J. Thomson.
  The mechanical forces F and R experienced by a unit charge and a
  unit pole respectively when moving forwards with the rest of the
  system are next investigated, and found to have true potentials, *
  and O, the same functions as those mentioned above.           These func

    The conditions which are necessary in order that the electricity
may be relatively at rest on any surface on which it is being conveyed
are next investigated, and it is shown that it is not the electric force
E, but the mechanical force F, which must be normal to the surface.
The equilibrium surfaces are therefore given by ir = constant. The
mechanical stress on the moving charged surface has a tangential com
ponent, and for certain directions of the normal may have a normal
component imoards, provided that u/v exceeds 0'810465, where « is

      fessor Arthur Schuster, F.R.S. Received March 17, 1896.
   Having been appointed by the Royal Society to the Joule Scholar
ship, and entrusted with the examination of some of the instruments
employed by Joule in his scientific work, I called upon his son,
Mr. B. A. Joule, in whose possession, were such of the instruments as
had not already been presented to the South Kensington Museum or
other places. Mr. Joule very kindly placed the instruments at my
disposal, and   I  am much indebted to him for the trouble he took in
searching his house for anything that might have been laid by.
   Most of the instruments       I removed to the Physical Laboratory at
Owens College, where there were greater facilities for examining
them. Throughout the research I have been greatly aided by the two
volumes issued by the Physical Society of London, in which all
Joule's scientific papers are collected, and in every case         I have
referred to the pages in these volumes where a complete description
of the instrument under examination may be found, with accompany
ing diagrams.
   The following list comprises all the more important instruments
remaining at Sale   : —
   Two electric current meters.
   The last apparatus for determining the mechanical equivalent of
      heat.
   An electromagnetic    engine.
   A  new balance.
   A  mercurial air exhauster.
   A  new form of dip circle.
   Two air pumps.
   Several thermometers and an instrument         for calibrating thermo
      meters.
   Two tangent galvanometers.
   All of these instruments were either made by Joule himself or
from his design and under his directions.
Two Electric Current Meters (' Collected Papers,' vol. 1. pp. 584 — 589,
                                also p. 542).
   As a good deal of discussion has lately been carried on about the
difference in the value of   J obtained by different methods, it seemed
important to find the value in our present units of the constant of the

346     Mr. J.  D. Chorlton.    Examination of some of the    [Mar. 19,
current meter which. Joule used in his determination of the equiva
lent of heat by the electrical method, and it would be interesting
either to confirm the value which Joule gives, or to apply some
correction to it in case the constant were found to be rather different
from that assumed by him.
   I  found two current meters at Sale, one of them being the meter
used in the determination of the equivalent of heat from the thermal
effects of electric currents.    This meter is contained in an oblong
wooden box, 4 ft. in length and about 18 in. in height and width,
the balance beam is made of wood, and is suspended from the
sides of the box by stretched wires which, after passing along each
side of the beam, suspend a flat horizontal coil of wire 1 ft. in
diameter; above and below this coil are placed two fixed coils
exactly similar to the suspended one. The current is passed through
the coils in such a way that the top coil attracts while the lower
repels the movable one, electric communication with which is in
geniously made by means of the suspending wires.
   At the other end of the beam is a counterpoise which brings
the movable coil into a position about midway between the two
fixed coils when no current is passing.     When an electric current
is passed the suspended coil is attracted upwards and is brought
back into its former position by means of weights placed on a shelf
attached to it.
   Joule says of this balance : " The strength of a current can in
this manner be determined in absolute measure ; for the area of
each of the three coils being called a, the weight required to
counterpoise the force with which the suspended one is urged w,

                    c = 1/2Z a/"'— (l  + correction),
the correction being principally due to the distance between the
fixed coils. In my instrument, in which this distance is 1 in., the
diameter of the coils being 12 in. and their interior core 4 in., this
correction was proved by experiment to be 0'1185
                                                         "

Papers,'  vol. 1, p. 543).
   Owing, however, to the difficulty in obtaining an exact measure
of the distance between the fixed coils, Joule abandoned this result
and found the constant of the instrument by comparing it with a
tangent galvanometer.
   In order to re-determine this constant. I passed a current through
this balance and through one of Lord Kelvin's current balances in
the Physical Laboratory at Owens College placed in series with it.

 is, into a position midway between the two fixed coils — and c be the

    It will   be noticed that the value of the constant      slightly, but fairly
regularly, decreases as the current decreases.
    I noticed this decrease in all the experiments     I  made    with both this
balance and the newer one, but was unable to find any explanation.
    I do not think it could be due to leakage through the wood of
                            I
Joule's balances, for tested them thoroughly for leakage and could
find none, nor could the electrostatic force between the coils be the
cause, for this, on calculation, appears to be quite inappreciable.
    For reading the balance a needle is provided fixed horizontally into
the end of the balance beam, the end of this needle oscillates in front
of a graduated scale attached to one of the sides of the box, the
observer's eye being placed to a small hole cut in the opposite side of
the box and thus any errors of parallax avoided.
    By this means the weight on the movable coil could be easily
adjusted to less than 5 milligrams, and as the weight varies with the
square of the current, the half only of any error made in the deter
mination of the weight appears in the estimation of the current.
    On reference to the above table it appears that with this balance
10 grams means about 3 amperes, so that 3 amperes may be measured
 correctly to 1 part in 4,000; it is also evident that as the weight
 varies with the square of the current the balance is much more
accurate for large than for small currents.
    A source of some trouble is a constant changing of the zero, that
is to say, the counterpoise at the end of the beam has to be frequently
adjusted in order to bring the movable coil into its zero position
 halfway between the two fixed coils.        I may mention that there is
 no accurate method of bringing the suspended coil exactly into this
 mean position, but by experiment I found that the exact point fixed
 upon as zero is immaterial, the value obtained for the constant being
 the same, whatever point, within certain limits, be chosen as zero.

   The second electric current meter was constructed some years later,
and while its design is almost exactly similar to the one just described,
its construction is in every way more finished and elaborate, and as
it is considerably smaller than the old balance (exactly Jths the size),
it is more convenient to work with.
   A very complete description of this balance is given in the ' Col
lected Papers,' vol. 1, pp. 584 — -589, it is, therefore, unnecessary to
describe it at length here,   I will only mention that a great improve
ment is made by the use of copper tape instead of copper wire in the
coils, the flat tape does not take up nearly as much space as the wire,
so that two coils made of tape will contain many more revolutions
and consequently will attract each other more strongly than two
coils of the same diameter made of wire.
   This may be seen from the following determination of the constant
by means of the Kelvin balance.

   Here again the steady decrease of constant with decrease of current
is noticeable.
   From the above table it will be seen that when 3 amperes are
 passing, the weight needed to restore equilibrium is about 25 grams,
 while it will be remembered that in the former balance only 10 grams
 were needed, and as in this case also the weights could be adjusted
 to 5 milligrams or less, 3 amperes may be measured with this balance
 correctly to 1 part in 10,000.
    Joule's determination of the value of       J  by the electrical method
 was undertaken      at the   request  of  the     Committee on Electric
 Standards appointed by the British Association ; the result he
 obtained was published in the B.A. Report, Dandee, 1887.
    He experienced a great deal of trouble in measuring the current
 because of the difficulty he found in determining the exact value of
 the earth's horizontal magnetic force at the time and place of the
 experiment.
    The arrangement he finally adopted was to pass the current
 through a tangent galvanomter and then through an electric current
  meter placed in series with it, the current being measured by the
 galvanometer and the current meter being used to determine the
 earth's horizontal magnetic intensity ; this was effected as follows : —

 1896.]     Scientific instruments used by the late        Dr. Joule.       349
    " Many careful observations of the horizontal intensity by           an  im
proved method on Gauss and Weber's system were made alternately
with observations of the deflections of a tangent galvanometer and
the weighings of the current meter when the same currents traversed
each in succession.      Then calling the horizontal intensity H, the
angle of deflection 0, and the weighing w, there was obtained a con
stant
                           fc  =  HW?=        0-17676.

          experiments for the determination of the horizontal intensity
could be effected in a few minutes."             (' Collected Papers,' vol. 1,
p. 545.)
    Of course, as soon as H is known the current is easily measured
by the tangent galvanometer, for we have the usual expression
                              Current =   —    tan  0,
where r is the radius of the galvanometer coil and           0 the deflection of
the needle.
   Now, since Joule found the constant
                          H tan    0 = 0-17676    vX
while the galvanometer coil, when measured in several places with a
standard foot rule, had a mean radius

or                            c = 0-017645 -fw.
   The units are grains and feet ; on conversion to grams and centi
meters c = 0'9742 \/w amperes, that is to say, the constant of the
balance is 09742.
   In the case of the newer balance, Joule found the constant by the
same method to be 06346.
   On referring back to the examination of the current balance, it will
be seen that for a current of about 3 amperes or 3'5 amperes, this
being the current at which Joule generally worked in these experi
                                                                  2 b 2

 350     Mr.  J. D. Chorlton.     Examination of some of the           [Mar. 19,
 merits, the constant of the old balance as determined by means of the
 " Kelvin balance " is 09766, while that of the new balance is 06316-
  So that in the case of the old balance           I  find a constant which is
 greater than that given by Joule by 2-5 parts in a thousand, while
 the constant of the new balance seems to come out about 4-6 parts in.
 a thousand less than the value given by Joule.
     My determination of the constant of the new balance is, however,
 not to be relied upon, because         I  found it exceedingly difficult to
 replace  the  upper  fixed coil, which   had   become unwound and had to
 be removed in order to be rewound in exactly the same position as it
 formerly occupied, so that the distance between the two fixed coils
 may have been altered, and in making an experiment to determine
 the amount of error which a slight increase in the distance between
 the two fixed coils would be likely to produce in the constant,               I
 found that on increasing the distance, which is about 1 in., by 1/16 of
 an inch, an increase of about 1 per cent, appeared in the constant.
    Fortunately, although the upper coil of the old balance had also
 become loose, there was no difficulty in replacing it exactly in its
former position.
    The " Kelvin " balance had been tested by silver electrolysis some
months previously, and found to be correct, and in order to assure
myself that it had not changed in the meantime,             I  afterwards again
tested it, with the same result.          As  no   trace  of  leakage could be
detected in the     " Joule  "
                               meter, it would therefore seem that some
error must have been made in the measurement of the radius of the
galvanometer or in the determination of H.                   Unfortunately,  on
examining the tangent galvanometer,           I  found that the coil used in
these experiments, which consisted of a single circle of 1/10 in.
copper wire, had got displaced, and could not be replaced exactly
in its former position ; in fact the measurement of the diameter
would have been liable to an error of 1 per cent.
    T have not, then , been able definitely to discover an error in any of
Joule's measurements, and can only indicate the probability that on
account of error either in the measurement of the radius of the
galvanometer or in the determination of the earth's horizontal mag
netic force, the currents in these experiments were estimated about
25 parts in a thousand less than their real value, and that as the
heat developed depends on the square of the current, the value of             J
given by these experiments may be too small by five parts in a
thousand.
    The experiments are divided into three series. The value obtained
f rom the first series was. 786'3, from the second 787, from the third
782-4; but Joule says that the extra precaution taken in the last
series entitles the last figure to be taken as the result of the inquiry.
    The value then obtained for     J  from these experiments was 782"4

foot-pounds at Greenwich at             a temperature of 18-6°, but this assumes
the B.A.         ohm (104'8 centimeters of mercury) to be correct. If we
take the         present unit (106'3 centimeters of mercury), this reduces
to     771*4,    which agrees very fairly with Joule's last value, 772'55 at
 16-5°, obtained from the friction of water. If, however, Jonle's
 current meter measured wrongly, as now seems probable, by abont
 2-5 parts in a thousand, it would seem that the equivalent of heat
 derived by Joule from the electrical method must be taken as 775-3,
 and Joule's results therefore seem to agree with those of more recent
 experimenters in pointing to a systematic discrepancy between the
 value obtained for          J  by mechanical methods on the one hand and
 electrical methods on the other. The thermometer used in the experi
  ments has been examined by Professor Schuster, and his result (' Phil.
  Mag.,' June, 1895) is that if T/ represent the reading on the Joule
  thermometer, and TN the reading on the nitrogen thermometer of the
  Bureau International, then T; = TN (I + 00024). Joule's value for the
  equivalent then from the electrical method is 777-2 foot-pounds at
  Greenwich on the scale of the " Paris " nitrogen thermometer at a
  temperature of 18'6°. Professor Schuster and Mr. Gannon, at the
  close of their paper on " The Determination of the Specific Heat of
  Water in Terms of the International Electric Units " (' Phil. Trans.,'
  vol. 186, 1895, A, pp. 415 — 467), compare the values obtained for                J

        Professor Schuster and Mr. Gannon remark that Rowland's num
     ber referred to the Paris nitrogen thermometer would probably be
     smaller by one unit ; this being the case, the higher values given by
     the electrical as compared        with the mechanical methods are very

    Joule's value subject to the above correction assumes the electro
chemical equivalent of silver to be 0001118; if the correction be
neglected, his value is obtained from purely electro-magnetic measure
ments, and is 773-3, closely agreeing with his value obtained from
frictional experiments. The values of Griffiths and Schuster and
Gannon also depend on silver electrolysis.
The last Apparatus for Determining the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat
     ('Philosophical Transactions,' 1878. Part        II;   also 'Collected
    Papers,' vol. 1, pp. 632—657).
    Joule gives the following account of the circumstances which
induced him to undertake the construction of this apparatus :—
     "The Committee of the British Association on Standards of Elec
trical Resistances, having judged it desirable that a fresh determina
tion of the mechanical equivalent of beat should be made, by
observing the thermal effects due to the transmission of electrical
currents through resistances measured by the unit they had issued,
I undertook experiments with that view, resulting in a larger figure,
 782.5, than that which I had obtained from the friction of fluids,
 772'6.     The only way to account for the discrepancy was to admit
 the existence of error either in my thermal experiments or in the
 unit of resistance. A Committee consisting of Sir Wm. Thomson,
 Professor P. G. Tait, Professor Clark Maxwell, Professor B. Stewart,
 and myself were appointed at the meeting of the British Association
 in 1870, and with the funds thus placed at my disposal I was charged
 with the present investigation for the purpose of giving greater
 accuracy to the results of the direct method."        (' Collected Papers,'
 vol. 1, p. 632).
     The method adopted was to revolve a paddle in a suspended vessel
 of water, and to find the heat produced, the work being measured by
 the force required to hold the vessel from turning, and the distance
 run as referred to the point at which the force was applied.
      The result of the paper was to confirm the earlier experiments,
 and to show that the BA. ohm was in all probability wrong to the
 extent of 1-3 per cent., the final value of the equivalent by this
  method being 772-55.
                                                                     I
      The apparatus is intact in all essential points, and it is, believe,
  the intention of Mr. Joule to send it shortly to the South Kensington
  Museum.
     An Electro-magnetic Engine (' Collected Papers,' vol.     1, pp.  1 — 3).
      This little instrument is of interest because it was the occasion of
  the first paper Joule ever published which appeared in ' Sturgeon's

1896.]      Scientific Instruments used by the late           Dr. Joule.         353
Annals of Electricity,' vol. 11, p. 122, being reprinted to form the
first of the collected papers. The paper is dated January 8, 1838, so
that this machine must be one of the first electric motors intended
for practical use.
    I did not attempt to test the efficiency of the motor because the
wire passing round the magnet was broken in several places, and to
have pieced it together would have involved the unwinding and
re- winding of the whole of the wire on the motor.
       A New Balance ('Collected Papers,' vol.            1, pp. 552 — 561).
    A  description of this instrument was read before the Manchester
Literary and Philosophical Society on March 20, 1886, and may be
found in the ' Proceedings of the Society' (vol. 5, pp. 145 — 165).
    The balance beam is suspended by a steel wire fastened to the sides
of the containing box, a leaden weight is let into one end of the beam,
 from the other end is slung a stage for the object to be weighed, and
 for the weights ; the centre of the box lid is cut out and roofed by
 means of a rectangular glass box ; from the centre of the upper edge
of the beam there projects vertically a light wooden rod which carries
 a small glass vessel for containing lead shot, by the addition of which
the stability of the beam may be decreased to any required extent ;
to the extremity of this rod a needle is fastened which serves as an
index, and oscillates in front of a graduated paper scale fixed on one
 of the sides of the glass box referred to above.             I found the balance
 intact, with the exception that the steel wire supporting the beam
 was broken ; this, however, was easily replaced.
    The feature of the balance is its exceeding simple and inexpensive
construction ; made as it is almost entirely of wood, it could be easily
 constructed by anyone possessing a little skill in the use of tools for
 a very  trifling cost.
    The sensibility of the balance of course depends entirely upon the
 amount of lead in the small glass bottle referred to.
    The following numbers were obtained when the sensibility had
 been increased as far as was possible consistently with stability.

   So that the average difference for 1 centigram increase of weight
is 1"2 scale divisions, and as each division can be read to tenths, an
article can be weighed by the balance to 1 milligram.
   Joule says that he could weigh with this balance to the hundredth
part of a grain, that is to the fifteen hundredth part of a gram.
   To test this I made a number of determinations of the weight of a
glass cube which had been previously weighed by an Oertling balance
and ascertained to be 207'020 grams in weight.
   The mean of these determinations gave a value of 207'0197 grams,
agreeing with the value obtained by the Oertling balance to less
than half a milligram.     Some of the values, however, differed from
the mean by as much as 2 milligrams.         Still, this is a remarkable
result for a balance made entirely of wood.

       A  new Dip-circle (' Collected Papers,' vol. 1, pp. 575 — 584).
   The instrument was described at a meeting of the Manchester
Literary and Philosophical Society (vol. 8, p. 171).
   Joule was not satisfied with the usual method of supporting the
needle of a dip-circle in which the cylindrical axle of the needle is
made to roll on agate planes, and, after trying several methods of
suspension, finally adopted one in which the axle of the needle rolls
on silk fibres.    His dip-circle received successive improvements, until
it finally assumed the form described in the ' Collected Papers,' on
p. 577.     A drawing of the instrument was exhibited at South Ken
sington, in the Loan Collection of Scientific Apparatus, 1876, and
afterwards remained there.
   Joule says that he could make an observation of the dip with this
instrument in about ten minutes, and that the difference between any
two consecutive determinations hardly ever exceeded a fraction of a
minute.     I  must confess, however, that      I  could not work with the
instrument to anything approaching that degree of speed and accu
racy. In the first place, the usual method of placing the needle in
the plane of the magnetic meridian, i.e., by finding the position in
which the dip is 90°, and then turning the instrument 90° in azimuth,
is impossible with this instrument, as may be seen from a glance at its
form. The only method, then, of finding the magnetic meridian is
to take successive observations with the needle in different planes
 until one is found in which the dip is a minimum ; this is a rather
lengthy operation, and may necessitate five or six readings before
the actual observations of the dip can be commenced.                The chief
difficulty,   however,  in  working   with   the  instrument    was   the great
friction between the axle of the needle and the silk fibres ; the original
fibres attached by Joule were broken, and I had to attach new ones.
 In what way the new fibres differed from the old ones I do not
know, but in my observations the friction, and consequently the dif
ference, between the readings was so great, and the tendency of the
fibre to slip to different parts of the axle, and so to throw the needle
out of the vertical plane, together with the vibrations incident upon
the method of suspending the vertical circle, so troublesome, as, for
all practical purposes, to render the instrument of little use. Joule
seems to have sometimes used spider-threads instead of silk fibres,
but the only needle      I could find belonging to the dip-circle was too
heavy for spider-threads.
     Two Air-pumps (' Collected Papers,' vol.        1, pp. 171 — 189, also
                                    p. 531).

    The paper was published in the ' Philosophical Magazine,' May,
1845, and also in the ' Collected Papers,' pp. 171 — 189, where a full
description may be found, including a detailed account of a new stop
cock.
    A   notice of the second pump, a compressing air-pump, may be
found on p. 531 of the ' Collected Papers ;' in this instrument the
cylinders, two in number, were made of great length, in order to get
rid of the necessity of packing, being 20 in. long and 2 in. in diameter.
Joule says that air can be readily compressed by the pump to
16 atmos. These two pumps were made under Joule's direction, and
with a little care would be in perfect working condition.
                              The Thermometers.
    The thermometers used in Joule's determinations of the mechanical
equivalent of heat have already been examined by Dr. Schuster,
 ' Phil.
          Mag.,' June, 1895.      Several thermometers, however, of less
 importance remain at Sale.
                  Instrument for Calibrating Thermometers.
    This is a small instrument, made for Joule by Mr. Dancer. It
 consists of a brass base with a groove for holding thermometers, over
 this is fixed a small microscope, which may be moved forwards by
 means of a fine screw with a graduated head ; the instrument is

                          Two Tangent Galvanometers.
    These galvanometers were not constructed by Joule himself, but
  were made for him, and under his directions, by the firm Abraham
  and Dancer, of Manchester ; one of these instruments was used for
  measuring the electric current in the determination of the mechanical
  equivalent of heat from the thermal effects of electrical current ; its
  needle is suspended by a silk fibre, the torsion of which, in accurate
  experiments, must be allowed for.        I found three coils belonging
  to the instrument; one of them consists of a single circle of thick
  copper wire, the second contains about ten revolutions of finer wire,
  and the third a large number of revolutions of still finer wire. These
  coils are mounted on wooden rings 12 in. in diameter, which slip on
  to the framework of the galvanometer, and may be removed or
  changed in a few seconds.
    The smaller instrument, which is about half the size of the larger,
  has three similar coils, 6 in. in diameter, belonging to it.

book partly filled with memoranda relative to the brewery, at one
end is a draft of the paper

extending over a period of several months.

        Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.
   Part of the apparatus used in 1843 for the determination of the
mechanical equivalent of heat : viz., a revolving piece, holding a
glass tube filled with water, and containing an electro-magnet.        This
worked between the poles of a powerful magnet; and the heat
evolved by the rotating electro-magnet was measured by the rise of
temperature of the water.        In this manner the quantity of heat lost
by  the   circuit   was   ascertained   when the machine worked as an
engine ; and, on the other hand, the quantity of heat produced when
work was done on the machine was also measured. 833 ft.-lbs. was
the mechanical equivalent of a degree F. in 1 lb. of water, as
determined by these first experiments.
219. Calorimeter,      containing a revolving agitator.     This was em
        ployed   in  the  experiments on the heat evolved by the friction

        772 ft.-lbs.
220. Cast-iron     Vessel,  containing Friction Disk, to revolve under
        mercury.       Used in 1849 to determine the mechanical equiva
        lent of heat by the friction of cast iron against cast iron. The
        equivalent arrived at was 775 ft.-lbs.
 221. Electro-magnet consisting of a broad plate of £-inch iron having
        a bundle of copper wires coiled round it.        Employed in the
        first determination of the mechanical equivalent of heat.
222. Apparatus for determining the temperature of water at its maxi
        mum density.
   Used in the experiments on        atomic volume and specific gravity by
Playfairand Joule (' Memoirs        of the Chemical Society,' vol. 3, 1846).
It consists of two tall vessels,     connected together by a stop-cock at
 the bottom, and a trough at         the top.  A minute difference of the

temperature of the water in one of the vessels from that of the
maximum density, determines a flow through the trough to the
vessel still nearer the temperature of maximum density. The tem
perature of water at maximum density was thus shown to be 39'1.

XI. " Effects of partial Thyroidectomy in Animals."                   By
        Walter Edmunds, F.R.C.S. Communicated by Dr. J. R.
       Bradford, F.R.S.       Received March 19, 1896.
                (From the Laboratory of the Brown Institution.)
    Gley, of Paris, has shown, in the case of dogs, that if in each of
 the two lobes of the thyroid gland the parathyroid be separated
from the thyroid tissue proper, and the latter (that is to say the
bulk of the thyroid) be excised and the two parathyroids left, these
are so sufficiently able to carry on the functions of the thyroid gland
as to keep the dog alive and apparently in good health : further,
if the two parathyroids are subsequently excised, the dog will die
with symptoms of athyroidea. It is not, however, even necessary to
leave both the parathyroids, for in two experiments I have found the
dog live when only one parathyroid was left, the animal dying only
when subsequently the parathyroid was excised.
   Gley also found that if partial thyroidectomy was so performed as
to remove both the parathyroids, it was necessary, in order that the
dog might live, to leave considerably more than half of one lobe of
thyroid tissue proper ; my own results agree with this.
    The changes which ensue in the portions of thyroid tissue and
parathyroids left in situ in these experiments are of interest.
   The portion of thyroid hypertrophies, obviously, as a rule, and
microscopically, there is found —
   (1.) An enlargement of the vesicles ;
   (2.) The secreting cells lining the vesicles become columnar, as
described by Hiirthle ;
    (3.) The inner wall of the vesicles becomes convoluted and raised
into minute papillae (as shown in accompanying figure) ; the effect of
this is to greatly increase the area of the inner surface of the vesicle,
and thus allow of a much greater number of secreting cells being
arranged one deep on the wall of the vesicle : indeed, very possibly,
the cause of the alteration is the demand for more thyroid secretion
leading to an increase in the number of secreting cells which would
require and make an increase of area of basement membrane ; a
simple enlargement of the vesicle, without any papillae, would no
doubt effect the same, but the mutual pressure of the vesicles and
that of the connective tissue between them would prevent this.
   (4.) The secretion in the vesicles is altered ; there is compara
tively little ordinary colloid, but, instead, a substance which stains
much less readily and appears to be of a more watery consistence.
   It is worthy of note that these appearances are almost identical
with those found in the enlarged goitre in cases of Graves's disease :

1896.]         Effects of partial Thyroidectomy in Animals.                        361
                                        Fig. i.
   From a dog the whole of one lobe of the thyroid, including the parathyroid, was
removed, and also the lower five-sixths of the other lobe, leaving only the upper
sixth and the parathyroid.      Figure shows (magnified 90 times) a section of the
thyroid tissue proper left; it was removed from the dog after 132 days.
                                         Fig.  2.
       Section of hypertrophied   thyroid in  a case of Graves's disease ( x 110).
 there too the secreting cells have become columnar, the walls of the
 vesicles are similarly convoluted (see figure), and the secretion con
 sists only to a small extent of normal colloid, but mainly of a sub
 stance which does not stain readily, and appears                        to be more
 watery.
    This resemblance is so close that it suggests that the cause of the
 goitre in Graves's disease is an attempt at compensation of some
 kind ; if so it would be necessary, in order to account for the extent
 and persistence of the change, further to suppose that the attempt at
 compensation was unsuccessful.
     The parathyroid that is left in these              experiments also enlarges.

 362      Sir  J.  W. Dawson.             Additional Report on Erect            [Mar. 19,
 Microscopically         the changes appear to be mainly of the nature of
 hypertrophy ;       the     parathyroid of the dog, like that of the rabbit
 under similar circumstances, does not develop into normal thyroid
 tissue, no vesicles develop and no colloid forms.
     Another change was noticed in these animals ; in two dogs, in
 one of which only one lobe of the thyroid had been left, and in
 the other only one parathyroid, it was seen that the eye on the
 side on which no thyroid tissue whatever had been left was more
 widely dilated than the other eye : this result cannot be explained by
 injury to the sympathetic, but the experiment requires repetition ;
 it is, however, in accord with some experiments in rabbits in which
 the parathyroids had been excised ; it was noticed that in some of
 these rabbits the eyes had become more prominent, judging that is
 by comparison with controls especially selected                       for each rabbit   op.

below that which had afforded the twenty-four erect trunks taken
out of the cliff and reef at Coal-mine Point and reported on in 1882,
erect stumps which he believed to contain animal remains.                             As  I
was at the time incapacitated for field work by the effects of a serious

was desirous to revisit the coast and to study the mode of occurrence
of the trunks in these new beds as well as to ascertain if additional
material could be obtained from them before reporting to this Society.
This I was enabled to do in the summer of 1895, when I succeeded in
obtaining from the reef extending seawards from one of the beds, the
bases of two additional stumps, the upper parts of which had, how
ever, been removed by the waves.
   One of the trees discovered by Mr. McNaughton was in Group 4,
Section XIII, and upper part of Coal-group 26 of the section in my
" Acadian Geology." It was, therefore, about 190 ft. below the bed
at Coal-mine Point in which the original reptiliferous trees were
rooted. The lower part of the trunk was filled to the height of
18 in. with black and grey coaly and arenaceous matter of laminated
structure, and containing the animal remains, which were of dark
colour and much injured by the percolation of ferruginous water.
Above this, to the height of about 7 ft., the trunk was filled with
sandstone.     It was 22 in. in diameter at the base. This tree had
been rooted in a grey shale or underclay 5 ft. thick, and the stem
was enclosed in a sandstone about 7 ft. in thickness.     The top of the
trunk is cut off by a shaly underclay, on which were seen a few ob
scure footprints of small reptiles, and on this rest coaly layers and
clay partings, of Coal-group 20, 2 ft. 4 in. thick, and roofed by a
tough, bituminous shale with shells of Naiadites, Cyprids, and fish
scales.    The remains of the two additional stumps found in the reef
were similar to that in the cliff, but only the basal part of their pro
ductive material remained. So far as yet studied, the bones in these
three stumps belong to species already known, as follows : —
   Hylovomvs Lyelli, f scattered bones of several individuals, and one
   H. latidens,        I   nearly complete skeleton.
   Hylerpeton longidentatum, three individuals.
   H. Dawsoni, two individuals.
   Dendrerpeton Acadianum, three individuals.
   D. Oweni, one individual.
   Fritschia curtidentata, one individual.
   There are also considerable portions of cuticle with horny scales
and ornamental appendages, apparently belonging to Hylerpeton and
Dendrerpeton, and also specimens of their ventral armour, and a few
remains of Millipedes.
   The other tree, taken out by Mr. McNaughton, was rather more
 than 204 ft. vertically below the preceding, and, in round numbers,
 400 ft. below the original bed at Coal-mine Point.     It was in Divi
   vot,. iaix.                                                 2 c

364    Sir   J.   W. Dawson.           Additional Report on Erect               [Mar. 19,
sion 4, Section XII, of the general section, and in the upper part of
Coal-group No. 21. It presented several interesting peculiarities.             It
was about 2 ft. in diameter, near the base, and stood 8 ft. high.            As
much as 5 ft. of its lower portion was filled with a very irregular
mixture of hard arenaceous and carbonaceous matter and vege
table fragments, evidently drifted in by rain-water, while there
were also layers and patches of brownish coprolitic matter, largely
composed of calcium phosphate, and showing under the microscope
innumerable fragments of chitinous matter, probably remains of
Millipedes, with numbers of small bones and bony fragments.                 Tbe
great thickness of productive material and the abundance of copro-
lite indicated that the tree had long remained open, and that some
at least of the animals contained in it had subsisted for some time on
the bodies of smaller Batrachians and Millipedes which had fallen into
their prison. One specimen of Dendrerpeton, found near the top of
the mass, is the largest yet known, its head being 5 in. in length.
The long duration of this tree          perhaps, accounted for by tho unusual
                                         is,
thickness of its outer bark.        It stood upon a thin, coaly layer resting
on an underclay, passing downward into a gray shale,              ft. in thick
                                                                           8
ness.   The lower part of the trunk was enclosed in alternations of
argillaceous shalo and flaggy sandstone to the height of abont               ft.,       5
and above this    it  penetrated for     ft. into
                                          3          thick, compact sandstone,
                                                      a
containing    a  few drifted trunks of trees.        It would seem, therefore,
either that the current conveying the sand had cleared away               ft. of    3
soft deposits surrounding the hollow trunk, or that the animals had
found access to the interior by a crevice or hole in the bark of a tree
standing  3   ft. above the surface on which they walked.
 I    may remark here that the beds enclosing erect tree3 are often
very irregular, as     if   deposited by local inundations, and that the
thick beds of reddish, mottled, and greyish sandstones which at the
Joggins separate the coal-groups, appear to be of similar origin.           The
great bivalve shell, Asthenodonta Westoin, of Whiteaves,*             found in is
one of these beds along with drift trees; and as               must have been
                                                                      it
a  freshwater species,     it was probably swept from some inland lake or
pond by a land flood.        This would seem to indicate excessive rains as
occurring    at   intervals   in the deposition of the coal-bearing rocks,
more especially in the Cumberland coal-field, and this may have been
connected with the number of erect trees, and the manner of their
burial.
    The tree just referred to must have entrapped at least twenty
Batrachians, as well as many Millipedes and land suails, embracing
most of the species hitherto found in these depositories, and two addi
tional species, which  I     have named Hylerpeton intermedium and Platij-
stegos loricatum.     Their description       as follows —

                       Mylerpeton intermedium, s. a.
    This species is known as yet only by the mandibles and portions of
the skull, which are rather shorter than those of adult individuals of
H. longidentatum, a few scattered bones and portions of the scaly skin
and ventral armature.         The extremity of the mandible and the
cranial bones have the same slightly waved surface as in the other
species.    Mandibles 3 cm. long, and the teeth, which are about
fifteen in each ramus of the lower jaw, are simple, with large pulp
cavities : those of the maxillary bone slightly enlarging upwards,
and intermediate in form between the long slender teeth of H. lotigi-
dentatum and the thick obtuse teeth of JB. Dawsoni.          The ventral
surface was armed with thoracic plates and long oat-shaped scales
closely placed in chevron.        The upper parts were covered with a
shining skin, in places ornamented with scales or rows of vandyked
processes, as in the other species of the genus.       The limbs seem to
have been well developed.
                         Genus Platystegos,   Dawson.
    Head broad and short ; orbits very large ; cranial bones deeply-
sculptured ; teeth strongly plicated and curved, with sharp edges at
apices, especially the inner palatal teeth, which are very large ; many
minute teeth on the vomerine bones ; vertebrae ossified, biconcave ;
limb bones imperfectly ossified, short ; lower surface protected with
a thoracic plate and thick, densely imbricated oval or quadrate bony
scales in transverse, chevron-wise rows ; body abovo with thin,
rounded scales, concentrically marked.
                         Platystegos  loricatum, s. n.
    Characters as above.       Head about 8 cm. long; when flattened,
9 cm. broad across parietal foramen ; squamosal or suprateiuporal
bones projecting backward          much behind the condyles ; parietal
foramen small ; orbits large ; length of longest tooth seen 7 mm. ;
cranial bones closely and deeply pitted; humerus with very thin
 bony walls, cartilaginous within, 3'5 cm. long.
    This animal seems, in its teeth and the form and sculpture of the
skull, to have been intermediate between Dendrerpoton and Baphetes.
 The bones of the best specimen are unfortunately dispersed in a very
 hard matrix.
    These new discoveries have not addod much to our list of species ;
and they show that no material change of land fauna occurred
 during the deposition of 400 ft. of beds. I hope in the course of this
 year to work out, photograph, and prepare for publication the principal
 portions of the new species, and also some now points relating to
                                                             2 0 2

   I may add that Mr. Devine, a miner who has devoted some time to
collecting on the coast, has observed footprints of Batrachians, of
various forms and sizes, in many of the beds between McCairn's Cove
and the abandoned Cumberland Mine, a thickness of about 2,500 ft.,
including the whole of the productive coal-formation. A large col
lection of these now exists in tho Peter Redpath Museum, awaiting
further study and description.

  " Variations in the Electromotive Force of Clark Cells with
        Temperature."       By W. E. Ayrton, F.R.S., and W. R.
        Cooper, M.A., B.Sc. Received October 29, — Read Decem
        ber 5, 1895.
     The present position of the Clark cell as a standard of E.M.P. is
  one of such great importance that    it is highly desirable to study its
  behaviour under all working conditions.       From time to time during
  the I*st few years the Board of Trade has issued specifications
  relating to its preparation, each one of which was modified according
  to the results obtained by the use of the one that preceded it. This
 led finally to the adoption of the cell as a standard, the specification
 being included in an Order in Council of last year.       More recently,
 in a slightly different form, it has been legally adopted by the United
 States of America, and it is probable that other countries will soon
 follow in the adoption of a standard which may already be regarded
 as universal.
    In this paper we propose to deal with temperature variations and
 their effect upon the accuracy of this standard.
    When employing a Clark cell for electrical measurements, it is
 often difficult to avoid changes of temperature which are sufficient to
 cause appreciable error if a corresponding correction is not applied.
 For example, in comparing such cells between themselves at frequent
intervals, the differences are generally observed to change from test
to test, and, in order that the figures obtained may be of any value,
it is of some importance to know how readily variations of tempera
 ture are reproduced as variations of E.M.F. in any particular cell.
 It is very usual to assume that the temperature coefficient amounts
approximately to 0'077 per cent, per degree Centigrade, or that the
 E.M.F. is diminished by O'OOll volt per degree rise of temperature.
 There is no doubt that such is often the case, at least for considerable
changes of temperature at a slow rate.       But we have always felt that
a good deal of uncertainty might exist as to the extent of this correc
tion, according as the temperature variation is very slow or compara
tively rapid.      Of course, large variations of temperature would
always be avoided, as they must necessarily be accompanied by a lag
in the corresponding changes of E.M.F. ; bnt, although ordinary
precautions may be taken, small variations generally occur.
    The question then arises — Are we justified in applying in full the
correction given above for variations of temperature such as occur in
practice, or should its value be materially diminished, except when
the cells have been subsequently kept at a steady temperature for a
very considerable time. It was with a view of obtaining more definite

    Variations in the  E.M.F. oj Clark   Cells with  Tem}
information upon this matter than could be found in any
 the subject that the experiments described below were
 than two years ago. It also appeared desirable to ascertain to
 degree of accuracy temperature coefficients could be determined by
 observing the changes in E.M.F. during a continuous change of
temperature.
   The tests were in all cases carried out upon cells set up in accord
 ance with the specifications of the Board of Trade, the greater number
of the cells employed in the investigation having been constructed
by one of the authors. Those employed in the preliminary experi
 ments were set up according to the specification of October, 1892,
but the remainder were made according to the final specification of
the Board of Trade.       They were contained in what are known as.
" sample tubes," approximately 1 inch in diameter, and the quantity of
paste and mercury employed was not large, the figures given in the
instructions being adhered to as far as possible. It will be readily
understood that many of the results obtained only hold good for this
class of cell, and that there might be considerable modifications
introduced by any large increase or decrease in the size of the cell.
   The method in the preliminary experiments was somewhat
approximate.     Current from a storage cell, in series with a resist
ance, traversed a potentiometer wire, the resistance being such that
the fall of potential along the wire amounted to either one ten-
thousandth or one five-thousandth of a volt per centimetre length as
required.    The E.M.F. of the storage cell was observed at intervals,
so that any necessary correction might be applied, and the current
could be reversed at any time by means of a key. The cell to be tested
was joined up in opposition to the standard, and their difference in
E.M.F. at once determined by the method of compensation.
   The standard used in the comparison consisted of one or other of
three Clark cells, kept, as far as possible, at a constant temperature,
ice being employed for that purpose.         The cells were placed in
corked boiling tubes, and these were supported in a water bath. The
latter was packed round with cotton wool in a wooden case, the lid
of which was only removed to replenish the bath with ice. Radiation
was thus diminished to a great extent, and as these preliminary
experiments were carried on during the winter it was possible to
maintain a comparatively low temperature in the room itself.     Never
theless, variations of half a degree, or more, often occurred in this
preliminary investigation, and the bath was considerably warmer at
the bottom than at the top. It was found best to pack a large
amount of ice into the bath, so that this difference remained fairly
constant. In general it amounted to about 1*5° C. As it was difficult
to apply a satisfactory correction, any variations in the temperature
of the bath had to be neglected. One of the above cells was employed

throughout for balancing the cells under test, and it was compared
at frequent intervals with the other two in the ice bath. The differ
ences between these were remarkably constant, so that it was probable
that the standard did not change to any great extent.
    Experiments were conducted upon several cells at a time. These
 were placed in a water bath surrounded by an outer vessel, also con
taining water. Heat was applied, and time readings were taken of
the temperature of the inner bath and of the differences of E.M.F.
 between each cell and the standard. The initial temperature was
 always that of the room, and, as there was an interval of at least one
 night between successive experiments, the cells were presumably in a
 fairly steady state before any heating began. The results were
 plotted in the form of curves, some of which are reproduced, having
 time as abscissae, and temperature, or variations of E.M.F., as
 ordinates.   In fig. 1 is shown the effect on four cells of a rise of
 13-4° C. in about four hours, after which the temperature was main
 tained approximately constant for nearly one hour and a half, and
 then allowed to slowly fall.  The upper curve shows exactly how the
 temperature was changing at any time ; and the lower curves the
corresponding effect on the E.M.F. of each of the cells. It will he
seen that each of the latter is similar to the temperature curve, the
irregnlarities of which are reproduced more or less closely according
to the sensitiveness of the cell. All the lower curves are, however,
displaced somewhat to the right, compared with the temperature ;
that is, a change of curvature, or a maximum in E.M.F., is generally
reproduced somewhat later than it occurs in the temperature curve.
There   is,  in fact, as would be expected for such a rate of variation
of temperature, a lag which      not the same in value for all the cells.
                                is
It will be observed that every cell curve drops almost as soon as the
temperature begins to fall.
   These preliminary experiments all tended to show that cells re
sponded very readily to variations of temperature. In fact, a glance
at the curves would lead one to think that lag was negligible, and
that cells reached a practically steady state after  a   few minutes of
steady temperature, any further small changes        of the  latter being
reproduced without delay. But these results can only be regarded as
approximate, and leave out of the question any possibility of what
may be termed a semi-permanent lag, by which we mean any slow
settling down after a large variation of temperature, before a cell
attains a really steady condition.     It, therefore, appeared desirable
to carry out further experiments with increased precautions to ensure
accuracy.
   For this purpose three cells were again used as a standard, and
were placed in boiling tubes fixed in a water bath, but instead of
putting ice into the latterit  was surrounded by an outer vessel into

which ice could be packed. As the ice melted the water was carried
off by a tube so that it stood at a level slightly above the bottom of
the inner bath. The whole was surrounded by cotton-wool in a
wooden case. By filling the outer bath with ice every evening it was
found possible to maintain the temperature of the inner bath fairly
constant throughout the following day, the variation rarely exceeding
two or three-tenths of a degree in the hottest weather.
   In order to check any variation of the standard through causes
other than temperature, it was frequently balanced against the P. D.
due to a known current of about | ampere passing through a known
resistance of about 3 ohms.    The latter was made especially for the
purpose, of manganin wire, wound upon an ebonite frame and im
mersed in paraffin oil.    It was previously aged by heating for five
hours at 140° C, and it assumed a steady value after two or three
weeks, as shown by frequent comparisons with standard manganin
coils. The current was measured by a Kelvin centiampere balance,
the constant of which had frequently been checked by means of
a silver voltameter.     By this means a variation of 0'00015 volt
could be detected without difficulty.
   The standards were soon found to become remarkably constant in
value. The E.M.F. of one cell was tested absolutely, as above de
scribed, before and after every experiment, and the three cells were
also frequently compared during the course of an experiment.        The
results were very consistent.

   A   stretched  wire,  ABD (fig. 2), 3 metres in length, was em
ployed in comparing cells under test.      The resistance of this being
known, the strength of current necessary to give a drop of potential
of one ten-thousandth of a volt per half centimetre length was calcu
lated, and also the resistance required when traversed by this current
to balance one of the standards whose E.M.F. was known. The resist
ance Ri in the diagram was adjusted so as to be as nearly up to this
value as possible, and the deficit was found in terms of a length AP of
the stretched wire.     For example, suppose the resistance necessary to
balance the E.M.F. of the standard cell E was found by calculation to

be   107-15 ohms.        Plugs would be taken out of the box Rt to the value
of 107 ohms, and the point P on the wire wonld be selected such
that AP equalled 0-l5 ohm. The current through the wire supplied
by a storage cell, C, was then adjusted by the auxiliary resistance
li-3 until the standard E was balanced between the points H and P,
or   so nearly balanced that no appreciable error would result.              In this
way the wire was rendered direct reading for any subsequent com
parisons,     |  cm. on the scale corresponding with one ten- thousandth
of   a volt.     A   mercury cup was attached to the terminal of Ki ; it
was therefore possible to join E with the end of Bii by simply dip
ping a wire into the mercury. Thus, any change of resistance in the
 main circuit by different pressure of the terminal, <fec., was elimi
 nated, and the value of the current could be readily checked at any
 time without interrupting the main circuit. This was done at fre
 quent intervals throughout every experiment. As a rule, very little
 variation was found to take place. The value of the E.M.F. of the
 standard cell was, of course, previously known.by an absolute deter
 mination.
     The cells under test were always connected with the point B of
 the wire (1 metre from A), and were balanced against the standard
 with never less than 10,000 ohms in series. The cells were placed in
 a water bath, having room for five ; the positive poles were joined to
 a common terminal, the negatives being led to separate mercury cups.
  Two stirrers were provided for keeping the temperature of the water
  uniform. There was also an outer bath containing the bath just men
  tioned.    This outer one was heated when required by passing steam
  through a piece of tubing immersed in the water, and cooled when
  necessary by means of ice.
     The temperature of a set of cells was generally varied through a
  considerable range, and brought back to practically the same value
  as  it had at the beginning of the experiment.            Supposing no lag to
  exist, the curve connecting temperature and E.M.F. would be the
  same for both rising and falling temperature.             But if there is a lag
  of short duration (i.e., not cumulative), then, provided that the tem
  perature varies at the same rate throughout, two distinct curves,
  parallel to the first for the greater part of their length, will result,
  and   will  enclose an area between them.
     Further, if there is any semi-permanent         lag, cumulative     in its cha
  racter, the form of curve shown at pq (fig. 3) would result, the up
  and down curves being parallel to one another, but inclined to the
  true direction yg.*         This assumes that the lag has the same valuo

  of course at a  different point from that for E.M.F. differences, but the former is

    In order to investigate the matter, several cells were subjected to
such cycles of temperature. For the results to be of any value it
was necessary that the temperature should be varied uniformly, and
preferably at the same rate when both rising and falling. A good
deal of difficulty was at first experienced, but some excellent tem -
 perature curves were afterwards obtained by Mr. W. G. Rhodes, to
 whom we are much indebted for assistance rendered throughout this
tedious part of the work. If the temperature slope became seriously
irregular it was readily detected upon plotting the curve of tempera
ture and time, and the E.M.F. readings corresponding with any such
irregular periods were then neglected in plotting the curves between
the temperature and E.M.F.
    The curves for E.M.F. differences that are reproduced should be
considered along with the corresponding temperature curves, which
in all cases are drawn underneath the former.            Rather a large
selection is given so as     to avoid  the  formation  of any erroneous
conclusion.     It will be noticed that the parts of an E.M.F dif
ference curve relating to rising and falling temperature are
seldom parallel.      It might be urged that this is due to residual
changes of temperature making themselves felt on the return
curve.     But all our experiments tend to show that lag (ex
cluding semi-permanent lag) for this rate of variation of tempera
ture does not, as a rule, exceed a quarter of an hour.         The curves
at either end would be affected in this manner for a length corre
sponding with about one degree (the rate of variation being about
one degree every quarter of an hour).          Beyond that errors might
arise amounting to one, or two, ten-thousandths of a volt, due to semi
permanent lag, but they would be insufficient to change the general
character of the curves.
    In order to avoid confusion, the cell curves have been separated
when necessary by displacing the origin of E.M.F. differences, so that
 different sets of figures along this axis correspond with different cells,
as shown by the distinguishing letters above them.            It must be
remembered that all the cells included in any one diagram were sub
jected to precisely the same treatment and tested under precisely the
same conditions.
    These curves indicate that the lag has generally a different value
for rising and falling temperature. The curves in fig. 5 were obtained
 by lowering the temperature about 9'5°, and then raising it through
the same range, but somewhat more rapidly.         The lag appears to be
smaller for rising temperature in the case of cells B, M, and L, the
              a
 difference being but slight in the last. Cells G and N are practically
 neutral in this respect, although it is to be observed that all the cells
 were in the same bath.

about 10'5°, and raising it again at the rate of one degree every
quarter of an hour. Cells F, W, and Z appear to have a smaller lag
with a falling than with a rising temperature, whereas there is very
little difference in cells C and X. In fig. 7 curves are shown for
nearly the same range of temperature, but this was maintained for a
longer time near its lowest point.                  Cells W and Z give curves
similar to those in fig. 6.         J  has a smaller lag for rising temperature,
and F appears neutral, though enclosing a large area.                  Pig. 8 shows
curves obtained when the temperature was first raised and then
lowered through about 8-5° at the rate of one degree per quarter
of an hour. Unfortunately we were accidentally prevented from
taking observations during one part of the time, but there is little
doubt that the curves follow pretty nearly the course marked. It is
noticeable that cells F and perhaps W appear to have a slightly
smaller lag with a rising than with a falling temperature, whereas
the reverse is the case in figures 6 and 7. Cell L has a similar
curve, and Z is now neutral, though not so formerly.                   Inequality of
lag for rising and falling temperature thus appears to vary from cell
to cell, and even to vary largely in any one cell, as shown by the
curves for cell B and others. The following table gives these results
in a manner more easy for comparison : —

    It  will also be observed that the curves between temperature and
 E.M.F. are seldom         closed, even though readings were continued for
 some    time after the former assumed a steady value, as may be seen
 by referring to the curves relating to temperature alone.                At the end
 of any experiment the cells became practically steady after about
 twenty minutes, and would then readily follow any subsequent varia
 tions, as, for example, in fig. 6. The slow rate at which cells assume
 a really steady state is shown by the curves which have been plotted
 between E.M.F. differences and time in the lower right-hand corner of
 figs. 5, 6, 7, 8, and which refer to the conclusion of each experiment.
 One hour and a half is generally quite insufficient to remove the
 semi-permanent lag for this rate of variation, as shown in fig. 8 ;

indeed,   it is sometimes found not to have completely disappeared
by the next morning.         In extent it seems to vary considerably,
even in the same cell.        For example, in the cell F, it is large in
fig. 6, small in fig. 8, and zero in fig. 7. It is considerable for both
W and Z in figs. 6 and 7, but small in fig. 8.
   In these curves no correction has been introduced for any variation
during an experiment of the temperature of the cells used as standards,
for the error probably did not amount to more than two, or three,
ten-thousandths of a volt, and there was some uncertainty as to such
variations.     The thermometer indicated the temperature of the water
in the bath, but the standards being in boiling tubes were sur-
rounded by air.       It is, therefore, probable that they did not very
readily   follow  any small variations in the temperature of the bath,
and it was consequently thought best to introduce no correction.
   In practice we seldom have to deal with such large changes of
temperature as 10° C. produced in 2^ hours. In order to observe
whether lag existed with slow variations, an experiment was carried
out, during which a change of about 2° up and down took place at
the rate of 1° in fifty minutes, as shown in fig. 9. Since the corre
sponding change in E.M.F. was rather small, it seemed desirable in
this case to introduce a correction for any change that might occur
in the temperature of the standard cell. And, since, in consequence
of the thin layer of air that separated this cell from the water in the
bath, small changes in its temperature might not be accurately
recorded by the thermometer in the water, an indirect method was
employed for detecting any small changes in the E.M.F. of the
standard by comparing it with the E.M.F.s of three cells placed in
a water bath and frequently stirred.        The standard was compared
with these at short intervals during the experiment, and their tem
perature, which rose approximately through 0'54°, was carefully noted.
One of these cells, although giving good results, did not appear to be
quite as steady as the other two, viz., M and N, which were very
consistent. It was accordingly discarded. Curves M and N con
necting the E.M.F. differences of these cells with time are plotted
in fig. 9. The dotted, curve may be considered as their mean. The
variation of this from the starting point, or from the base line ab,
is due to two causes — (1) change in temperature of M and N, (2)
change in the temperature of the standard.          From the results ob
tained it may be fairly assumed that the cells M and N have not
otherwise changed in themselves.        If the variation due to change of
temperature of M and N can be estimated, that due to change in the
 standards can then be deduced. But this cannot be done without
assuming some knowledge of the quantity we are investigating, viz.,
taking it for granted that cells are readily affected by small changes
 of temperature.      As, however, this conclusion is supported by much

evidence,   it is probable that carves corrected by a quantity so
obtained will be nearer the truth than if left uncorrected.
   From previous experiments it appeared that the E.M.F. of II and
N fell about 0'0010 volt per degree rise of temperature. The ordi-
nates of the curve Ti above the line cd give this rise of temperature
from the beginning of the experiment, and are also numerically equal
to the changes of E.M.F. Hence, if the ordinates of the dotted enrvo
are diminished by these corresponding ordinates of Tt, another curve
ee is obtained, of which the ordinates from ab give the variation of
the standard. Since it is wholly below ab, it follows that the E.M.F.
of the standard fell during the experiment, but rose to nearly its old
value at the conclusion, a result which agrees with the absolute
measurements taken. This curve enables the figures obtained from
the cells under test to be corrected, the correction, however, being
small  : they are given in their final form in fig. 9, along with the
corresponding temperature curve TaTi. The changes in E.M.F. were
measured to l/50,000th of a volt, and a larger scale is used in this
diagram so as to render the differences more apparent.           The curves
are very  similar to those already  discussed. Lag  is still evident, though
of course much diminished. Cells W and Z show practically no lag of
a semi-permanent character, but it is strongly marked in L and F,
although a steady temperature had been maintained for some time at
the end of the experiment.         Curve L is noticeable, as showing the
uncertain character of lag in a cell, a point which is also exemplified
by the curve for B in fig. 8. Other curves of the same kind have
been obtained, one of which relates to B, but they have not been
reproduced.
   It might be supposed that part of the lag observed was really due
to lag in the thermometers themselves.         But on subjecting these to
cyclical changes of temperature this was found not to be the case.
   In general, it thus appears that Clark cells of this type are very
sensitive to changes of temperature, but are subject to a lag, which
is variable in value, even when these changes of temperature are
small.    For that reason it is generally impossible to apply a cor
rection which shall be accurate to 1/ 10,000th of a volt for even very
slow variations of temperature.          Of course, in work involving a
knowledge of the absolute E.M.F. of the cell, this is of no great im
portance, as we do not know the value of the E.M.F. to greater
accuracy than 0'l per cent, in true volts, but it may be of import
ance when dealing with comparisons.
   If we suppose a cell to be placed in a water bath, the temperature
of which is 3'0° different from that of the cell previously, we may
conclude that after the lapse of half an hour the lag will not amount
to more than 0-l per cent, of the E.M.F., and will generally be less.
In such cases the temperature coefficient should be diminished some

      Variations in the E.M.F. of Clark Cells with Temperature.      381
  what in value when correcting for actual variations, unless these
  take place with extreme slowness. In fact, it would appear that a
  more suitable value for the temperature coefficient, for use under
  ordinary working conditions, would result from such curves as those
  given above, although it would not be the true value.         It must,
  however, be remembered that cells differ among themselves some
  what as to the value of the coefficient.
     The cells were carefully examined, but, although small differences
  were apparent, their appearance furnished no characteristics by
 which the observed phenomena might be accounted for. As already
 mentioned, the majority of the cells were constructed at the same
 time, and many were precisely alike as far as could be judged, for
 example, W, X, Z.
    It has for some time past been suspected that the lag of the
 E.M.F. of a Clark cell behind the temperature was due not merely
 to the mean temperature of the cell itself lagging behind that of the
 bath, but to time being necessary for the variation of the amount of
 crystals in solution and for diffusion to take place.
    How far this cause of lag is diminished by the use of the H type
 of cell, where there is only one horizontal surface of contact between
 metal and liquid, we are about to determine experimentally.
    In conclusion, our thanks are due to Mr. W. G. Rhodes, as already
stated, and also to several students, among whom we would mention
Mr. F. S. Grogan, who gave much time to the work.
    There appears to be a general tendency for the E.M.F. of cells set
up in accordance with the final specification issued by the Board of
Trade to fall somewhat below the normal value after the lapse of some
months.     For example, the E.M.F. of cells set up in October, 1894,
although,   as a rule, not differing from l-434 volts at 15° C. by more
than 1 part in 3000 when tested soon after construction, is now low
by fully 1 part in 1000. The same may be said of cells set up in
November, 1894.       But the E.M.F. of cells constructed in June, 1895
although falling, is still not low by more than about 1 part in 2000.

                       ending December 31, 1895.
   The operations of The Kew Observatory, in the Old Deer Park,
Richmond, Surrey, are controlled by the Kew Observatory Committee,
which is constituted as follows    : —
                          Mr. F. Galton, Ghairyian.

   Prof. A. W. Riicker.                     C.B.
   The title of the Committee has been changed during the year at
the suggestion of the Council of the Royal Society, with the approval
of the Board of Trade. The change consists in the insertion of the
        "               " and the omission of the word "
word      Observatory                                         Incorporated,"
so that the new title is in full  "   The Kow Observatory Committee of
the Royal Society."
   The work at the Observatory may be considered under the fol
lowing heads: —
   1st.   Magnetic observations.
   2nd.   Meteorological observations.
   3rd.   Solar observations.
   4th.   Experimental, in connexion with any of the above departments.
   5th.   Verification of instruments.
   6th.   Rating of Watches and Marine Chronometers.
   7th.   Miscellaneous.

384              Report of the Kew Observatory Committee.
                          I.   Magnetic   Observations.
   The Magnetographs have been in constant operation throughout
the year, and the usual determinations of the Scale Values were made
in January.
   The ordinates of the various photographic curves representing De
clination, Horizontal Force, and Vertical Force were then found to be
as follows   : —
           Declinometer      : 1 inch = 0° 22'04.    1  cm. = 0° 8'7.
   Bifilar, January 15, 1895, for     1 inch 2H = 0-0280 foot grain units.
                                    „ 1 cm. „ = 000051 C.G.S. unite.
   Balance, January 16, 1895, for 1 inch oV= 00276 foot grain units.
                                    „ 1 cm. - „ = 000050 C.G.S. units.
   With regard       to magnetic disturbances    no very exceptional move
ments have been registered during the year.            Some of the principal
variations that were recorded took place on the following days : —
   February 8—9, 15; March 18—14; April 11—12; May 10, 29;
June 2—3 ; September 30 ; October 12—14, 28—29 ; November 9 —
 12 ; and December 7 — 8.
   The hourly means and diurnal inequality of the magnetic elements
for 1895, for the quiet days selected by the Astronomer Royal, will
be found in Appendix I.
   Tho following are the mean results for the entire year : — :
      Mean     Westerly Declination                 17' 16'8.
      Mean     Horizontal Force                     018278 C.G.S. units.
      Mean     Inclination                          67023'8.
      Mean     Vertical Force                       043901 C.G.S. units.
   Observations of Absolute Declination, Horizontal Intensity, and
Inclination have been made weekly as a rule.
   A Richard Thermograph has been placed in the Magnetograph
Room in order to compare its readings with the observed readings of
the Thermometer under the Vertical Force shade, and also to obtain
a continuous record of the temperature of the room throughout the
year.
   As in 1894 a Table of recent values of the Magnetic Elements at
the Observatories whose publications are received at Kew was con
tributed to the July number of ' Science Progress.'           As this seems to
meet a recognised want, the Committee have decided to go further in
the same direction, and to publish a similar table annually in their
 Report (see Appendix Ia). In some cases the results are direct

              Report   of the Keto Observatory    Committee.          385
transcripts from the official publications ;  in others they are deduced
from the recorded monthly or quarterly       means.    In a few instances
figures have been supplied by directors of observatories in answer to
special requests.
    With the consent of the Committee an analysis of the Declination
and Horizontal Force results for the selected " quiet days " of the
five years 1890 to 1894, extracted from previous Reports, with addi
tional results required for a complete discussion, was drawn up by
the Superintendent, and appears as the Report of ' the B. A. Com
mittee for the Comparison and Reduction of Magnetic Observations,'
Ipswich, 1895.
    Professor Riicker and Mr. W. Watson spent some time at the Ob
servatory in July and October, comparing their magnetic instruments
with the Kew Unifilar and Dip Circle, on behalf of the B. A. Com
mittee for the Comparison of Magnetic Instruments (B.A. Report,
1895, p. 79).
    Captain Schiick visited the Observatory in June, and made a
series of observations in order to compare his own instruments with
those of Kew.
    The Magnetic Instruments have been studied, and a knowledge of
their manipulation obtained by Captain Field, Commander Cnst, and
.Lieutenant Dawson, of the Royal Navy.
   Information on matters relating to various magnetic data have
been supplied to Mr. Veeder, Captain             Schiick, and Professor
Riicker.
                   II.  Meteorological   Observations.
   The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registra
tion of Atmospheric Pressure, Temperature of Air and Wet-bulb,
Wind (direction and velocity), Bright Sunshine, and Rain, have been
maintained in regular operation throughout the year, and the
standard eye observations for the control of the automatic records
duly registered.
   The tabulations of the meteorological traces have been regularly
made, and these, as well as copies of the eye observations, with
notes of weather, cloud, and sunshine, have been transmitted, as usual,
to the Meteorological Office.
   With the sanction of the Meteorological Council,       data have been
supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological Society, the
Institute of Mining Engineers, and the editor of ' Symons's Monthly
Meteorological Magazine.'
   Anemograph. — A considerable number of experiments made to
check the correctness of the wind vane by comparison with a flag
                                                             2 e 2

386             Report 0/ the Kew Observatory Committee.
                                  *
led to   no certain conclusion.     It only appeared that if any error
existed it must be small.
   Electrograph. — The performance of this instrument throughout the
year has not been satisfactory.       Some twenty-seven days' records
were lost in January and February through stoppage by the frost,
and for about forty-five days in July and August the instrument was
out of action. Towards the end of the year the performance was
generally unsatisfactory.     After a good deal of fruitless investiga
tion as to causes affecting the scale value, the insulation in the
quadrant electrometer and the water-dropper can, the defect has been
traced to a gradual deterioration in the insulation of the wire con
necting the can with the electrometer. Action is contemplated
which will reduce in future the chance of such a misadventure.
   On June 11 the instrument was dismounted, old acid removed, and
a new suspension, with almost parallel sides, fitted up in order to
widen out the scale.
   Determinations of the scale value were made on April 5, May 28,
June 11, and November 27 by direct comparison with the Portable
Electrometer, White 53.
   This latter instrument was sent to White, of Glasgow, in Decem
ber, 1894, to have a new torsion suspension fitted, and to be generally
overhauled.
   After its return from the maker the value of its scale was kindly
determined by Professor Carey Foster at University College Labora
tory, and the mean value for one division found to be 290 volts, and
this new value has been employed in obtaining the scale-figures for
the self-recording instrument.
   Inspections. — In compliance with the request of the Meteorological
 Council, the following Observatories and Anemograph Stations have
been visited and inspected : — Radcliffe Observatory (Oxford) by
Dr. Chree ; Stonyhurst, Armagh, Valencia, Fleetwood, Falmouth,
and Dublin by Mr. Baker ; and Yarmouth, North Shields, Alnwick
 Castle, Fort William, Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Deerness (Orkney)
 by Mr. Constable.
                        III. Solas Observations.
   Sun-spots. — Sketches of Sun-spots have been made on 159 days, and
 the groups numbered, after Schwabe's method.
   Particulars will be found in Appendix II, Table   IV.
                        IV. Experimental Work.
   Fog and Mist. — The observations of a series of distant objects,
referred to in the last Report, have been continued. A note is taken

                 Report of the Kew Observatory Committee.                        387
of the most distant of the selected objects which is visible at each
observation hour.
   Atmospheric Electricity. — The series of eye observations commenced
last year with a Portable Electrometer at certain points in the imme
diate neighbourhood of the Observatory have been continued.                      The
results arrived at seem interesting in themselves, and are likely to
prove of service in interpreting and checking the records obtained
 with the water-dropper and electrograph.
   Aneroid Barometers. — The apparatus referred to in last Report was
delivered by the maker, Mr. J. Hicks, early in the year, and a large
number of experiments have been made and reduced ; the results
have not yet been published.
   Nocturnal Radiation. — Regular observations of two minimum
thermometers freely exposed on grass, having shown that a constant
lowering of their zeros had been taking place for some years ; two
other minimum* have been obtained, and the four instruments are
now being daily observed under similar conditions.                  It is believed
that this lowering of zero is mainly caused by the exposure of the
bulbs to strong sunshine during summer.
   Thermometry. — A set of French hard glass thermometers, standard
ised at the Bureau International, have been obtained, together with
a hypsometer of the Sevres pattern, constructed under the direction
of Dr. Guillaume.          Some preliminary comparisons have been made
between the French thermometers and some Kew standards at tem
 peratures between the freezing point of mercury and 100° C.
   Platinum Thermometry. — This subject has of late years come into
prominence mainly through the memoirs* of Professor Callendar and
Mr. E. H. Griffiths. The conclusion they have reached is that sup
posing
           " platinum temperature," pt, be defined so that its equal
increments answer to equal increments in the electrical resistance of
a pure platinum wire, the formula
                           t-pt =    «{(7/100)3-0/100)},
where    t  is temperature on the air scale, and S a constant — for a par
ticular sample of wire — holds, with at least a close approach to
accuracy, throughout a wide range of temperature. The convenience
of platinum thermometers for measurements of high temperatures
 has been independently testified to by Messrs. Heycock and Neville
 in their extensive researches in connexion with the freezing points
of metals and alloys.f          Even in dealing with ordinary temperatures
the advantage possessed by a platinum thermometer, that it may be
read at a distance from the spot where the temperature is measured,

 388            Report of the Kew Observatory Committee.
 would seem important in many cases, e.g., in observations on earth
 temperatures.
   Taking the above facts into consideration, the Committee decided
 to instal platinum thermometers at Kew, and to institute an in
 dependent series of experiments into their behaviour.        Attention
 will in the first instance be directed more especially to the question
 of the fixity of the zero and of the fundamental interval.     A grant
of £100 was obtained from the Government Grant Committee,
for the purchase of platinum thermometers, and the other necessary
apparatns. A new room has been built for the purpose of the
inquiry, from designs by Mr. W. N. Shaw and Mr. E. H. Griffiths, at
a cost of over £120.       Mr. Griffiths also kindly superintended the
construction of the apparatus by the Cambridge Scientific Instru
ment Company, and along with Mr. C. T. Heycock he visited the
Observatory for some days in October, and illustrated tho use of the
platinum thermometers, and the reduction of the observations.         A
full account of the apparatus has been given by Mr. Griffiths in
' Nature,' November 14th, 1895.
   Hitherto at Kew the examination of mercury thermometers at
temperatures above 100° C. has been limited to calibration.        This
supplies trustworthy knowledge as to the uniformity of the bore and
the graduations, but throws no light on the suitability of the glass
for exposure to high temperatures. It is also inapplicable to those
high range thermometers in which there is gas, at high pressure,
above the mercury column.         The Committee hope that means will
shortly be devised for direct comparison of thermometers at high
temperatures, and expect that the platinum thermometers will in
cidentally prove useful for this purpose.

  390          Report of the Kew Observatory Committee.
    Two Standard Thermometers have been supplied during the year.
    There were at the end of the year in the Observatory undergoing
 verification, 10 Barometers, 533 Thermometers, 12 Sextants, 4 Hydro
 meters, 4 Anemometers, 2 Air Meters, 2 Rain Gauges, and 2 Rain
 Measures.
               VI. Rating   op Watches and Chrosometers.
    The high standard of excellence to which attention was drawn in
 last year's Report has been fully maintained, and there has been an
increase not only in the number of movements entered for the class A
trial, but also in the number of watches which have obtained the
highest possible form of certificate — the class A especially good—
 (involving the attainment of 80 per cent. of the total marks), no less
 than 59 being so classed.
    The 746 watches received were entered for trial as below : —
    For class A, 435 ; class B, 207 ; class C, 92 ; and 12 for the subsi
diary trial. Of these 10 passed the subsidiary test, 129 failed from
various causes to gain any certificate ; 62 were awarded class C
certificates, 190 class B, and 355 class A.
    In Appendix   III will be found a table giving the results of trial
of the 59 watches which gained the highest number of marks during
the year. The first place was taken by A. E. Fridlander, Coventry,
with a keyless, going-barrel, lever-watch, No. 13,911, which obtained
87'4 marks out of a maximum of 100.
    Marine Chronometers. — During the year 58 chronometers have been
entered for the Kew A and B trials, of which 52 were certificated,
and 6 failed to pass.
    Considerable difficulty was experienced during the autumn in
regularly maintaining the temperature of the watch oven at about
90° F., and to overcome this, a new gas boiler — by Fletcher and
Company, Warrington — has been fitted up, to replace the old tubular
heating apparatus, which had become much worn. The opportunity
was taken to have a new water-tight cover made, and the non-con
ducting packing material was also renovated.
    A new draw-off pipe and cap have been fitted to the refrigerator, to
prevent any accumulation of water from the melting ice-
    The seconds contact pieces on the mean-time standard clock having
become much worn, the clock has been sent to Dent & Co., to be put
in thorough order, and to have their electric contacts fitted. When
ready it will be fixed in a new position in the South Hall, where the
temperature is very steady.
    The mean-time clock Dent 2011, kindly lent to the Committee by
the Astronomer Royal, is being used during the interval.

               Report   of the Kew Observatory Committee.           391
                            VII. Miscellaneous.
    Paper. — Prepared photograph paper has been supplied to the
 Observatories at Hong Kong, Mauritius, St. Petersburg, Oxford
 (Radcliffe), and Stonyhurst, and through the Meteorological Office to
 Aberdeen, Batavia, and Fort William.
    Anemograph and Sunshine Sheets have also been sent to Hong Kong
 and Mauritius.
    A  portable electrometer (White, No. 77) has been procured and
 forwarded to Manritius.
    Exhibition at Imperial Institute. — A selection of photographic
curves from the various self-recording instruments, along with cloud
 photographs and specimens of early daguerrotypes were shown
'during the summer at the exhibition of photography at the Imperial
 Institute.   The chairman and superintendent were included in the
Committee of Advice.
    Pendulum Apparatus. — The apparatus sent out to Melbourne in
 1892 has been returned, and is now being repaired by Mr. P. Adie.
The air pnmp is receiving a new frame, and the dummy pendulum
 a new brass shaft and fittings.
    House, Grounds, and Path. — These have been kept as usual through
out the year. The road leading from Richmond to the Observatory
 wa8 extended inside the new enclosure, the fencing of which was
•completed early in the year.      The expense was defrayed out of the
 balance of Extension Fund brought forward from last year.
    To meet an increased demand for gas, a new and larger main has
 been laid between the Observatory and the building outside, which
 contains the platinum thermometer room and clinical thermometer
testing apparatus.       Simultaneously a larger meter and new gas
 governors were fitted up in the Observatory.
   First Assistant Director at Mauritius Observatory. — At the request
•of the Colonial Office, the Committee undertook the task of selecting
and recommending a candidate for the post of First Assistant
 Director at the Royal Alfred Observatory, Mauritius.      Their choice
 fell on Mr. J. Folkes Claxton, previously engaged in the Meteoro
logical and Magnetic Department of the Royal Observatory, Green
wich, and their nomination was approved by the Colonial Office.
Subsequent to his appointment in December, Mr. Claxton spent a'
few days at the Observatory to familiarise himself with the patterns
of meteorological and magnetic instruments in use at Kew.
   At the request of the Acting Director of the Central Physical
Observatory at St. Petersburg, submitted through the Meteoro
logical Council, an account of the Observatory, dealing more espe
cially with its functions as a meteorological station, along with plans

392            Report of the Kew Observatory Committee.
of the building and its surroundings, has been drawn up by the
Librarian. This is ultimately to be contributed to the meteorological
section of an exhibition to be held at Nijni Novgorod in 1896.
   Library. — During the year the library has received publications
from —
   31 Scientific   Societies and  Institutions  of  Great  Britain and
        Ireland.
   114 Foreign    and Colonial Scientific  Establishments,  as   well as
        from several private individuals.
   Sir Malcolm Fraser, in response to a request to that effect, kindly
presented the library with several back numbers of the Meteoro
logical Report for Western Australia ; and M. Perrotin also pre
sented the ' Annales of the Nice Observatory.
                       '
   Dr. Neumayer has kindly consented to forward regularly the
                                                               '
'Annalen der Hydrographie und Maritimen Meteorologie             of the
Deutsche Seewarte, a publication which frequently contains results
of magnetic interest.
   On re-examining the manuscripts and papers bequeathed to the
Observatory by General Sabine, several books of autograph letters
written by leading foreign scientific men were found, amongst others
letters from Gauss, Lamont, Regnault, Weber, Ac.
   The card catalogue has been proceeded with, sixty-five cards having
been entered daring the past year.
   Audit, 8fc. — The accounts for 1895 have been audited by Mr. Keen,
Chartered Accountant, on behalf of the Royal Society, and super
vised by Mr. Francis Gal ton, on behalf of the Committee.
   The change in the system of book-keeping, referred to in last
year's Report, renders impossible the comparison usually made
 between the expenditure of the year and that of the previous one.
   The Observatory has now an account with the London and County
Bank only, having closed its account with the Bank of England.
 This renders it unnecessary to keep so large a cash balance as
previously, and as the balance at the end of 1894 was unusually
large, the Committee have been enabled to purchase £900 India
         cent, stock.
3£ per
   A small surplus remaining from the Extension Fund, contributed
 by Mr. Galton for constructing a fence round the Observatory, has
 been transfeiTed to the general account.

                 Magnetical Observations,         1895.
Made at the Kew Observatory,              Old Deer Park, Rich
   mond, Lat. 51° 28' 6" N. and Long.            0h lm 15B-1 W.
   The results given in the following tables are deduced from the
magnetograph curves which have been standardised by observations
of deflection and vibration.   These were made with the Collimator
Magnet K.C. I. and the Declinometer Magnet marked K.O. 90 in the
9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones.
   The Inclination was observed with the Inclinometer by Barrow,
No. 33, and needles 1 and 2, which are 3^ inches in length.
   The Declination and Force values given in Tables I to VIII are
prepared in accordance with the suggestions made in the fifth report
of the Committee of the British Association on comparing and
reducing Magnetic Observations.
   The following is a list of the days during the year 1895 which
were selected by the Astronomer Royal, as suitable for the deter
mination of the magnetic diurnal inequalities, and which have been
employed in the preparation of the magnetic tables : —

Report of Magnetical Observations at Falmouth Observatory
       for the Year 1895. Latitude 50° 9' 0" N. and Longitude
       5° 4' 35" W. ; height, 167 feet above mean sea-level.
   These observations have been made by instruments purchased from
the Government Grant Fund administered by the Royal Society.
   The peculiar difficulties attending the proper working of the
'Vertical Force Magnet, reported in 1894, have not been overcome,
and the results obtained are not sufficiently reliable for publication.
The Committee contemplate approaching the Royal Society, with a
view to having a new Vertical Force Magnet provided in place of the
present defective instrument.
   Photographic curves of Magnetic Declination and of Horizontal
Force variations have been taken regularly throughout the past year,
and the magnets have worked satisfactorily.
   The scale values of the instruments were determined on 2nd
January, 1896. The following values of the ordinates of the photo
graphic curves were then found : —
      Declination, 1 cm =0° 1T7.
      Bifilar, for 1 cm. $ H., = 000050 C.G.S. unit.
   The principal magnetic disturbances recorded during the year
occurred on the following dates : — February 9, 10, 15, 16, March
13, 14,   April   11, October 13, 14, 29, November 9, 10, 24.
   Observations       with the Absolute Instruments have been made
monthly,    of which    the following is a summary : —
         Determinations of Horizontal Intensity, 38.
                    „           Inclination,            37 sets of four.
                    „           absolute Declination, 39.
   Following the method adopted in the four previous years, it is
intended that the observations be reduced, and that the Declination
and Horizontal Force curves for five quiet days in each month of the
                                                —
year — selected by the Astronomer Royal be tabulated and prepared
for publication, in accordance with the International scheme.              The
results  will  be  printed   in  the  Royal  Cornwall   Polytechnic   Society's
                                       "              "
Annual Report, and also in the Proceedings               of the Royal Society.
   The following are the principal results of the magnetic elementr
for the year 1894 : —
        Mean Westerly Declination, 18° 54'5.
        Mean Inclination,                 67° 0'4.
        Mean Horizontal Force,            0-18547 C.G.S. unit.
  VOL.   MX.                                                        2 o

416               Report  of Magnetical  Observations   at
   The Declination and Horizontal Force are deduced from hourly
readings of the photographic curves, and so are corrected for the
diarnal variation.
    The Inclination is the mean of the absolute observations, the mean
time of which is 3 p.m.
    In Table V, X is the mean of the absolute values observed during
the month (generally three in number), uncorrected for diurnal
variations and for any disturbance.     Y is the mean of the products of
the Dips and the X.
    The results in the following tables, Nos. I, II, III, IV, are deduced
from the magnetograph curves which have been standardised by
 observations of deflection and vibration.        These were made with
 the Collimator Magnet marked 66a, and the Declinometer Magnet
marked 66c in the Dnifilar Magnetometer by Elliott Brothers, of
 London.      Table No. V is deduced from these observations.         The
 temperature correction (which    is probably very small) has not been
 applied.
    The Inclination was observed with the Inclinometer No. 86, by
 Dover, of Charlton, Kent, and needles 1 and 2, which are '6\ ins.
 in length, the results of which appear in Table VI.
     The Declination and Horizontal Force values given in Tables to    I
 IV are prepared in accordance with the suggestions made in the
 fifth report of the Committee of the British Association on com
 paring and reducing magnetic observations, and the time given is
 Greenwich mean time, which is 20 min. 18 sec. earlier than local time.
     The following is a list of the days during the year 1895 which
  were selected by the Astronomer Royal, as suitable for the deter
  mination of the magnetic diurnal variations, and which have been
  employed in the preparation of the magnetic tables : —

      The Azimuth of the fixed mark used in deducing the Observations
  of Absolute Declination was checked by Professor A. W. Riicker,
   M.A., F.R.S., on August 7, 1895, by means of an Observation of the

              Falmouth Observatory for the Year 1895.              417
Sun's Azinruth, and determined as 1° 16' 25" E. of N., which agrees
practically with the original determination of 1° 16' 30" E. of N., the
value hitherto used.
   The whole of the instruments have been maintained in good order.
The Magnetic Chamber and the Magnetic Hut in the garden have
been kept in a satisfactory state of dryness during the year, savo
for three days in December, when the Chamber was flooded owing to
excessive rainfall.

       OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
    Gael Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig was bom on the 29th of Decem
ber, 1816, at Witzenhau8en, on the Weser, near Cassel.       He graduated
at Marburg,    in 1839, became    prosector   under  Professor L. Pick, in
1841, and the year after obtained the venia legendi, offering for his
dissertation   a paper on the mechanism of the renal secretion.         In
1846 he became Extraordinary Professor at Marburg, and in 1849 he
was    appointed ordinary   Professor    of Anatomy     and Physiology   at
Zurich. In 1855 he became Professor of Anatomy and Physiology
in the Army Medical School (Josef 's-Akademie) at Vienna.         In 1865,
when the new chair       of   Physiology    was   constituted at Leipzig,
Ludwig was invited to occupy it, and afterwards assumed the direc
tion of the new Physiological Institute, which had been erected under
his own supervision.      For a time he took an active part in the
reorganisation of the teaching of natural science in the University, but
subsequently, and for the remainder of his life, devoted himself almost
exclusively to the work of the laboratory.
    In 1874 a collection of original memoirs was presented to him, in
commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of his professorship,
by men holding distinguished positions in science, who had worked
with him at Marburg, Zurich, Vienna, or Leipzig. A second Festgabe
of the same kind was offered to him in 1886, on his seventieth birth
day. He also received a similar honour from his university, on the
fiftieth anniversary of his graduation in medicine. In 1884, Ludwig
visited England, to receive the Copley Medal, and was warmly
welcomed by his physiological friends, many of whom had been his
pupils. As evidence of the influence which his teaching exercised
in this country, it may be mentioned that five of the contributors to
the Festgabe of 1886 (Brunton, Cash, Gaskell, Schafer, Wooldridge)
were English physiologists.
    Among the many lines of investigation of fundamental importance
which Ludwig initiated, some of the most remarkable depended on
the discovery of new methods.        Just as the microscope had opened to
the anatomist unexplored      fields  of research, by bringing him into
closer relations with objects which were before beyond his scrutiny,
so the recent rapid progress of physics and chemistry had placed
 more exact modes of observation and of measurement within reach
 of the physiologist.    But the application of these methods was
    vol. lix.                                                      6

attended with great difficulty ; there were no physiological labora
tories, no instruments, no capable mechanicians to whom the physiolo
gist could apply for assistance. Under these conditions, ingenuity and
resource were indispensable to success, and in these qualities Ludwig.
besides being conversant with the physical science of the time, was
pre-eminent. Accordingly, we find that two of the most important
of his early investigations were as much due to his ingenuity as an in
 ventor, as to his clear grasp of the physiological questions which hi&
inventions were intended to elucidate. The most interesting of these
inventions in its bearing on Ludwrig's scientific career was that of
the kymograph (or, as he called it, the kymographion) ; for the know
ledge gained by it was of so fundamental a character, that it in-
great measure took the place of all that was before known as to the
relations of pressure to flow in the circulation.   This instrument, of
which the use is to record the oscillations of a mercurial manometer
on a surface moving horizontally at a uniform rate, was first described
in a paper published in Midler's ' Archiv,' in 1847,* " On the Influence
of the Respiratory Movements on the Blood-stream in the Aortic
System."      Poiseuille had some ten years before used a similar mano
meter to measure the lateral pressure exerted against the internal
surface of the arterial system by the blood contained in it. This
pressure Ludwig desired to register automatically, and by so doing to
obtain a permanent record of the effects which are produced on the
action of the heart and on the circulation by muscular movements.      He
subsequently proceeded to examine in the same way those variations
in pressure and flow which depend on the incessantly varying func
tional activity of organs, or on the direct action of the nervous
system.     The general result of these early researches was to pave
the way for those later experimental investigations by wrhich wc have-
learned that the blood-stream is so controlled by the nervous system,
that the afflux of blood to each part is at every moment adapted to its
requirement.      The discovery of the kymograph led to much wider
applications   of  the method of automatic inscription.   Ludwig himself
applied  it,  as we have seen, to the recording of the movements of
 respiration, as well as of the variations in arterial pressure.   Subse
 quently, as elaborated by Chauveau and Marey,       it became known as
 the "graphic method," and    it serves not only for the investigation of
 animal movements        of every conceivable kind, but even of the
 transient and delicate electrical changes which are associated with
 vital action.
     Space does not allow me to do more than mention other con
  trivances of Ludwig for the study of the circulation, such, for

Physiological Laboratory at Turin, having been given by Ludwig to Professor
Mosso, one of his most distinguished pupils.

example, as the stream-gauge, for recording the flow in a blood
vessel, or the methods used by him for maintaining artificial circula
tion in a separated part or organ, so as to observe its function inde
pendent of the organism to which it has belonged ; all of which have
yielded information of fundamental importance.
    Another instrument invented by Ludwig, the value of which to
physiology has been nearly as great as that of the kymograph, is the
mercurial blood-pump, the purpose of which is to separate from a
known quantity of blood derived directly from the circulation, the
mixture of gases which it yields to the vacuum. It is sometimes
stated that Ludwig derived this instrument from Professor Lothar
Meyer, who was, at the time he entered on his investigation of the
gases of blood, engaged in researches on the same subject in Bunser.'s
laboratory, and employed an apparatus for the extraction of the blood
gases in which tho vacuum was produced by the condensation of steam.
To Meyer* belongs the credit of having first succeeded (1857) in ex
tracting the blood gases, and of having made the first reliable analyses
of them ; but it was Ludwigf who, in 1859, invented the first mercurial
pump, and described it in a paper published under the name of his
pupil Setschenow. After that time the pump underwent various
modifications of form but not of principle, in the progress of thfe
extended series of researches on the gases of the blood which Ludwig
commenced at Vienna, and carried out at Leipzig ; so that the final
form — that employed in the Leipzig laboratory by A. Schmidt in his
research on the carbon dioxide of the coloured blood corpuscles and
usually described as Ludwig's — although the samo in principle, differs
considerably in aspect from the original one.
    The importance of the discovery of an exact method of investi
gating the gases of the blood could be best judged of if it were
possible to submit to the reader a summary of the researches con
ducted by means of it during the last thirty-five years.                        Of the
enormous amount of work which has thus been clone, Ludwig and his
pupils have contributed a very large proportion.                     Of the earlier
experiments carried out          in the  Vienna      laboratory, Ludwig himself
published a general account in 18(55. After his removal to Leipzig,
the subject developed in so many directions, that it is impossible to do
more than mention certain series of observations such as those on
the gases of lymph, on the gaseous exchange of living muscle, on
the presence of oxidisable material in the blood and its significance,
&c. These and other researches relating to the physiology of the
respiratory exchange, which were conducted under Ludwig's direction,

which he continued, to the very end of his life, the work he had begun
thirty-five years before. Not one of the numerous series of investi
gations relating either to the internal or pulmonary exchange which
were undertaken during that period, failed in adding materially to
knowledge ; yet at the end of it the work was still going on. Thus
 in the ' Arbeiten ' of the Leipzig laboratory for 1894, we find an
 important research on the respiratory exchange in the abdominal
 viscera as estimated by temporarily shunting them out of the circu
 lation, and another on the influence of grape sugar on the gases of
 the blood — both characteristic examples of his method.*
    It will be seen from the preceding paragraph that Ludwig's
discoveries relating to circulation and respiration, depended largely
 on his command of physical methods of research.                 In his equally
extensive and important investigation of the conditions                    which
regulate      the  functions   of secreting glands, we have, along with
 additional evidence of his unrivallod skill as an experimenter,
 no less striking proofs that he was also a consummate anatomist.
 The physiology of secretion occupied his attention throughout his
 whole life.      In 1842 it was the subject of the academical disserta
tion  which     he  presented to the University of Marburg on entering on
his career as a teacher ; and in 1889 we find him working with Novi
at a branch of the same question that he had discussed in his youth.
 It is forty-five years since he undertook to investigate the funda
 mental question whether, when a gland is thrown by the stimulation
 of its nerves into a state of activity while at the same time its supply
 of blood is increased, the first effect is dependent on the second.           An
experiment, remarkable for its extreme simplicity, settled the question.
 Ludwig showed that in the head of a rabbit just severed from the
 body, stimulation of the nerves of the salivary glands still determined
secretion, notwithstanding that there was, of course, no circulation.
 Later, he proved, by an experiment on the same gland, that the process
 of secretion, previously supposed to be one of " vital chemistry," could
 be so transformed experimentally as to do external mechanical work,
and he thus established, between work-producing and secreting struc
tures, a relation which had not before been thought of.
    It has been mentioned that the earliest of Ludwig's published
researches was on the physiology of the kidney.                 His prolonged
investigation of this subject illustrates, perhaps better than any
other, the scientific attitude of his mind. The adaptation oF structure
to function is displayed in this organ in so striking a way, that from
the moment that its minute anatomy was successfully made out by
Bowman (1842), the teleological explanation which he gave was at
   * These two papers appear under the names of Professor Tangl and Dr. V. Etarlev
respectively.

once accepted as adeqnate.        To Bowman these evidences of design
afforded complete      satisfaction, but to Lndwig they suggested
rather a bundle of unsolved problems than an explanation. To him
the first step seemed to be to compare the discharge of the renal
secretion from the blood, with the filtration of liquid through a non
living membrane of a similar character, in other words, to investigate
the then little-known process of liquid diffusion.     It was by applying
the results of this preliminary physical inquiry to the kidney that he
was led to make the experiments which will ever remain the founda
tion of knowledge on the subject to which they relate, as proving
that the two processes — the physical and the organic — are affected
in the same way by difference of pressure between the two sides of
the membrane.       It was not asserted by him that these were the
only conditions, or even the most important.         Consequently, when
Heidenhain, many years after, proved experimentally that the separa
tion of the organic constituents of the urine from the blood was the
work of living cells, actuated rather by chemical than physical condi
tions, Ludwig was able to regard the evidence not as a contradiction
of his own results, but as an addition to them. Having promulgated
no theory, but merely summed up the relations which his own experi
ments had proved to exist, he had nothing to withdraw from,
nothing to object to. The strongest evidence of all against what was
supposed to be his theory of renal secretion was, indeed, obtained by
the aid of an experimental method already referred to, which was
par excellence his own — that of observing the function of an organ
in which the circulation is maintained artificially after it has been
separated from the body of the animal to which it belongs. For by
the application of this method it was more conclusively shown than
by any other, not merely that the secreting cells are the indispen
sable agents in the separation of the organic constituents of the urino
from the blood, but that a sufficient supply of oxygen, as well as the
presence of urogenetic substances in the circulating blood, are con
ditions essential to their activity.
   Before I attempt to give a general account of Ludwig's character
as a teacher and as a man of science,    I must say a word or two about
his academical lectures, and about the only book, so far as I know,
that he ever published — the famous ' Lehrbuch.'       The interest of the
        —
lectures often of a couple of hours' duration      —  consisted (as 1 have
learned from a distinguished pupil of Ludwig)      in  the fact that, what
ever the subject, they were throughout illustrated by the results of
work originated by Ludwig himself, and done, often recently, in the
laboratory, so that everyone felt,
                                     " this is not hearsay ; the evidence
is here on the spot." It was this that made them of such value to
the mature student.
   As regards the 'Lehrbuch,' it is necessary to carry oneself back to

                                     VI
 the fifties, in order to appreciate its extraordinary influence, for it
 was in 1852 that the first volume appeared.      To those whose concep
 tions were derived from the current teaching of that time, it seemed
 destructive.    It made no mention of " vital forces ; " it did not even
 give a definition of life or of organisation, but defined physiology as
  " the determination of the activities (Leistungen) of the
                                                              living body,
 with reference to the elementary conditions on which they are
 dependent ;" the writer's aim being to resolve these conditions into
 their simplest elements, and so bring them within the scope of
 chemical and physical laws.     Accordingly, he began his treatise with
 the discussion of the elementary endowments of the structure or
 framework of the living body, and of the processes in which these
 endowments manifest themselves ; seeking to arrive at a clear con
 ception of each vital function by regarding it as a complex of
 constituent processes severally definable in chemical or physical
 terms.    The book set forth no '• biological principles," and therefore
  had no interest for the general reader. It was for students and for
 students only, but for them it was a revelation, a forecasting of the
 physiology of the future for those who were about to make it. The
 second edition was published in 1862, but had no successor.
     It may be noted here that Lndwig, like Darwin, avoided contro
 versy. When, in 1875, certain important investigations which had
 been conducted in the Leipzig laboratory were made the subject of
 inconsiderate criticism, he persistently resisted the importunity of
 friends, who pressed him to reply, saying that he preferred to leave
 the future to judge between him and his distinguished opponent.
     In the preceding pages I have endeavoured to give the reader an
 idea of the chief directions which Ludwig's activity followed.     No one
 who is acquainted with the modern development of the science of
 physiology can fail to see that the history of Ludwig's life work was
 in truth that of the science which he did so mnch to create ; for its
 development from small beginnings during the second half of the
century has coincided in a remarkable way with his career as a dis
coverer. In certain lines of investigation, as, for instance, those which
relate to the localisation of the higher functions of the nervous
system, Ludwig took little part, but in every other direction hit;
researches have been of fundamental importance. All the great
functions of the organism, whether mechanical or chemical, have
been investigated by him collectively and separately — as processes by
themselves, in their relation to the vhole organism, and as regulated
by the nervous system.
    That one man, however endowed, should have been able even in so
long a period of activity to accomplish so great a work can only be
explained by referring to the conditions of the earlier years of his
academical life.    At Marburg he was engaged in two lines of work

                                        Vll
 which we are not now apt to associate together.          He was a physicist on
 the one hand, and an anatomist on the other. At the very time that he
 was engaged on his first great discoveries as to the mechanism of the
-circulation, it was his official duty, as prosector, to teach medical
students in the dissecting room.          Being no less a master of the new
methods which the invention and introduction of the microscope had
 rendered available, than he was of descriptive anatomy, he was able to
approach his great subject — the animal machine and its working —
 from the physical and anatomical sides at the same time. That in his
 lifework the former was the more emphasised, arose from the circum
stance that the advance of physical science had rendered so much
 possible, that before could not be attempted. There were, however,
-other circumstances which led him in the same direction ; such, for
example, as his intercourse with Bunsen — until 1851 Professor of
 Chemistry and Physics at Marburg — a man who could not fail to
exercise a powerful influence on such a mind as Ludwig's.              To him
there is reason to believe that he was indebted for that technical
 knowledge of gas-analysis which in later years was to bear such
magnificent fruit. Still greater importance must, I think, be attached
to an incident which occurred in 1847, when, in the course of a visit
 to Berlin, he made acquaintance for the first time with his three life-
friends — Helmholtz, Briicke, and du Bois-Reymond.              For it was not
 Ludwig alone that created modern physiology. It was rather the
 four friends (in mentioning whom the name of another contemporary
— that of Donders — though he was not one of them, must not be for
 gotten), all of whom, as we know from their writings, were of one mind
 in determining so far as they were concerned, to throw speculation
  overboard, and to pursue the methods of the exact sciences in their
 place. That four such men should be brought together at the very
 turning point of their several careers, was, indeed, a memorable event
 in the history of physiology. The time was come for its reunion with
 the exact sciences, and these were the men who were to effect it.
The change would, we may be sure, have eventually been brought about,
  had these leaders of thought and work not been to the front, but it
-cannot be doubted that its progress wonld have been retarded.
     The wide range of Ludwig's researches made them more fruitful
 for the advance of physiological knowledge than those of any of his
 contemporaries.       For although some of the discoveries made, e.g., by
 Helmholtz* and du Bois-Reymond may have surpassed any of his in
 brilliancy, neither of these distinguished men could claim to be master
of so many subjects in physiology. No one, during so long a period
 of activity, held in his hands so many threads of investigation without
 losing hold of any of them or allowing them to interfere with each
    *  In the comparison hero made between Helmholtz and Ludwig. reference is
 made exclusively to the physiological work done by the former.

                                   Vlll
other. It was this perfect grasp of the whole subject — this familiarity
with the infinite complexities of structure and function in the animal
organism, and with all possible methods of exploring them, that made
Ludwig unsurpassable as a teacher.      The motive which attracted men
to him was the assurance that they would receive the best guid
ance in whatever line of physiological inquiry he advised them to
pursue, and that they would, if genuine students, be welcome not only
to his laboratory, but to his sympathy and friendship.       Ludwig in
the midst of his students seemed to be happier than anywhere else,
for here two joys were experienced together — the joy of satisfying
that thirst for discovery which was as insatiable in the last years of
his life as it had been in his best days, and that of communicating
his own enthusiasm to younger men and engaging their energies in
new work.
   The Leipzig Institute was an observatory, the work of which was-
carried out in a way which such a director as Ludwig can alone make
successful.    For every worker he found a problem, reserving the
more intricate ones for those who were possessed of the requisite
training and insight, but at the same time finding simpler, but not
useless, occupation for those who, with less gifts, had patience and
industry.    In the publication of the final results of the researches
which he initiated, he gave, as is well known, more than full credit
to his junior coadjutors ; so much so that even the most important
papers in the well-known
                            '
                              Arbeiten ' appear under the names of the
students who carried out the work under his direction.
   In can readily be understood that Ludwig's relation to his young
friends, as he called them, was of an exceptional kind. For he was
felt to be as superior to other men in respect of his moral nature as
he surpassed them in genius.       The same sincerity and earnestness
which actuated him in his laboratory work were also the motives of
his ordinary life. Thus it happened that those who worked with him,,
 however grateful they might be for the advantages they enjoyed and
the instruction they received, esteemed it to be an even greater
 privilege to come into personal relation with one who possessed so-
 noble, so loving, and so lovable a nature.
                                                             J. B. S.
    Chart.es Cakdale Babington, was born at Ludlow, on the 23rd
 of November, 1808. His father, who was originally a member of the
 medical profession, afterwards becoming a clergyman of the Church
 of England, took considerable interest in botany. Whilst his son was-
 still a schoolboy he retired from work and settled at Bath. The
 subject of our present memoir entered St. John's College, Cambridge,
 at the age of eighteen, took his B.A. degree four years later, and his-
 M.A. at the age of twenty-five. At first his inclinations were towards

entomology, but he attended Henslow's lectures on botany, and like
so many others, fell under his magnetic influence.               He joined the
Linnean Society in 1830, and for a short time after the death of the
Rev. L. Jenyns, was its oldest Fellow. His first botanical book was
the ' Flora Bathoniensis,' published in 1834.             He visited Ireland in
company with the late Mr. John Ball, in 1835, and gave an account
of his tour in the 9th volume of the ' Magazine of Natural History.'
His ' Primitiae Florae Sarnica ' was the result of excursions taken
during two long vacations, in one of which the Rev. W. W. New-
boald was his companion, and was published in 1839. In company
with Professor J. H. Balfour, he visited the Outer Hebrides, in 1841,
and reported on their scanty vegetation.                His work was almost
entirely   confined   to  British  Botany,     but   he  published in the 18th
volume of the Transactions of the Linnean Society,' a monograph of
                 '
the Indian Polygonums, and in the 11th volume of the ' Journal
of the Linnean Society,' a paper on the " Flora of Iceland," giving a
complete list of the Phanerogamia of the island, which he had visited
 during the year 1841.         The first edition of his magnum opus, th&
 '
   Manual of British Botany,' appeared in 1843.                 This work ran
 through eight     editions  during   his  life-time    and  was  for fifty years
 almost universally used as a hand-book and standard of nomen
clature by local botanists who made a study of critical British plants.
 The special feature of the work was a careful study of the difficult
 genera by means of the books and fasciculi of dried specimens pub
lished by the critical botanists of the neighbouring continental
 countries.   In the early editions he relied mainly upon Koch, Fries,
 and Reichenbach, and in the later to these were added the writings-
 of Grenier, Godron, Boreau, Jordan, and Lange, and the Exsiccata of
 Reichenbach, F. Schultz, and Billot.            This book brought him into-
 frequent   communication     with  nearly   all  the active collectors in diffe
 rent parts of Britain, and entailed upon him a mass of correspondence
 as referee, which occupied a large proportion of his time. The writer
 of the present notice remembers with feelings of gratitude the kind
 and patient way in which the Professor helped him in his difficulties
 when, between forty and fifty years ago he was beginning the study of
 British botany, and was living in a small country town where there-
 were no herbaria or books of reference.                  Professor Babington
 generally spent his long holidays in exploring some rich botanical
 district at home, such as the Snowdon country, Braemar, and Tees-
 dale, and in this way made acquaintance in a living state with most
 of the plants with which he had to deal. Amongst the genera and
 subgenera that he revised may be mentioned Atriplex, Arctium,
                                                                                  '
 Fumaria, Batrachium,          Cerastium,      Dryas,     Armeria, Saxifraga,
 Hieracinm, Potamogeton, and especially Rubus.                  He contributed
 about 150 papers, mainly on critical British               plants, to different
 periodicals and societies.

    Iii 1846 he published   the first edition of his ' Synopsis of British
 Rubi,' and a much-enlarged second edition in 1869. This was in
 tended to have been illustrated by a series of plates drawn by Mr.
 J. \V. Salter, but the preparation of these was stopped by Salter's
•death, and they were not published.
    In the " Ray Society," which was founded in 1844, as an enlarge
 ment of a " Ray Club," which was started in 1836, he took an active
 interest, serving on its council and helping in the editing of some of
 its publications, especially the volumes devoted to the memoirs and
correspondence of the great naturalist from whom the Society took
 its name.
    He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1851, the same
 year in which Huxley, Sir Jame.s Paget, and Lord Kelvin were also
elected, but he never took any active part in the affairs of the Society.
    In I860 he published his ' Flora of Cambridgeshire,' in which the
distribution of the species through the different districts of the
'county is traced out very carefully, and the changes in the vegetation
 caused by the drainage of the fens are dwelt on.
    On the death of Professor Henslow in 1861, Babington succeeded
 him as Professor of Botany at Cambridge, and held the Chair up
 to the time of his death, on the 22nd of July, 1895. His lectures dealt
mainly with organography and systematic botany, and were not
accompanied by laboratory work.              They were discontinued for
several years before his death, and as years went on the teaching
of botany in the University passed into the hands of the men of
a younger generation, with different ideals and different plans of
work.
    A very full biography, with a portrait, will be found in the Sep
 tember number of the ' Journal of Botany.'
                                                               J. G. B.
    John Sybk Bkistowe was born June        19. 1827, at Camberwell, where
his father was a general practitioner.         He was educated at King's
College   School, and subsequently entered St. Thomas's Hospital as a
medical student. He showed, however, a predilection for art and
literature, for at an early age he published a book of poems, and his
drawing showed considerable power. He nevertheless worked hard
in his destined career, and obtained prizes both in his own school and
at the University of London, where he took his M.B. degree in the
year 1850, and the M.D. in 1852. He was occupied with various
minor positions in the medical school until he was appointed Assistant
Physician in 1854, and full Physician in 1860. He became Fellow of
the Royal College of Physicians in 1858, and a Fellow of the Royal
Society in 1881. The honorary title of LL.D. was also conferred
upon him by the University of Edinburgh.           He devoted much of the

                                     XI
early part of his medical life to the study of pathology, in which he
became most proficient.     The greater part of his work was published
iu the ' Transactions of tho Pathological Society.'     His communica
tions are enriched by illustrations ; the drawing being the work of
his own hand, and some of the microscopic plates are exceedingly
beautiful.    All his communications were of great value, as they
always added considerably to the knowledge of the subject then
current.     Although he made no great original discovery by which
his name could be attached to a particular disease, yet he did
much more than many that have thus become immortalised by
enriching a large number of subjects by his skilful hand and clear
understanding.
    In  1876 a London     publisher,  seeing there was much need of a
work on medicine, applied to Dr. Bristowe as the man most capable
of undertaking a work involving a knowledge of the whole range
of subjects required.      He fulfilled his task, and produced a large
volume on the       '
                      Theory and Practice of Medicine.'     This was at
once    received by the profession as a treatise of the highest excel
 lence, and became a text-book for students.       So conscientious was
the author that, in order to make the work entirely his own, and
as practical as possible, he became for some time a diligent student
at Bethlem.      He was thus enabled to write his chapter on insanity
 from personal knowledge, and produced an essay on the subject of
the first order.       It may be added that Dr. Bristowe was espe
 cially inclined towards the study of nervous diseases, and conse
quently his chapters on these affections are amongst the best in his
 treatise, and equal to any that can be found in ordinary English
 works. Every subject which he took up he studied thoroughly, so
 that had he wished he might have become a specialist in many
 departments, as for example that of skin diseases, of which he had
« remarkable knowledge.
    He delivered lectures at the College of Physicians and at various
societies, and he did excellent work for the Privy Council Office,
Sir John Simon having the highest opinion of his scientific power.
 We may mention amongst the subjects which he investigated, that
of phosphorus poisoning, cattle plague, and the sanitary state of
 English hospitals ; the report on the latter subject, made in con
junction with Mr. Holmes, becoming a standard of reference.            He
 was indeed    a great authority on sanitary matters, having    been one
of the first medical officers of health appointed in London   ;  an office
which he retained until his death, forty years afterwards.
    Amongst a great number of collateral subjects which interested
him was that of speech, and he embodied his views in some admirable
papers on the mechanism of articulate speech.        In one of these he
clearly showed that the Welsh LI is not to be pronounced by the

                                   xn
combination of     any English letters, but is a distinct    elementary
Welsh sound.
   Dr. Bristowe has been President of many societies, and was, at
the time of his death, a member of the Vaccination Commission.
On leaving St. Thomas's at the expiration of his term of office money
was subscribed to institute a prize medal to his memory, and a portrait,
painted by his daughter, was hung in the committee room. It may
be here stated that Dr. Bristowe left behind him several sons and
daughters, all of whom are of exceptional ability. During the Chartist
riots he was sworn in as special constable, and he might then have
been seen in the night patrolling before his father's house, baton iu
hand.
    Dr. Bristowe may be said to have been not only artistic in his
 nature but endowed likewise with the true scientific spirit ; so that
 everything he did was sound and accurate, and contained a solid
 addition to existing knowledge.       He not only had a profound
 acquaintance with disease as presented by the living subject, but
 an equally profound knowledge of pathology, so that he had no
 rivals in this subject, nor was there a better clinician.    He was of
 amiable and kindly disposition, and in every respect a good and an
 honest man ; although possessed of superior knowledge, he was too
 modest to assert himself, still less put forth his opinions as positive
 or final ; he felt many problems in medicine were too difficult for
 solution, and therefore he did not make the same impression on his
 students as more confident and dogmatic men often do ; but the
 older and more advanced students thoroughly appreciated his ex
 cellence.   For the same reason he never had a large private practice,
 for here positiveness and assertion have considerable weight. It
 can be well understood that a man of this character could not
 give credence to the efficacy of the numberless drugs which are
 every day prescribed, and that he, consequently, was called a sceptic
 in reference to therapeutic treatment.      His scientific mind tended
 rather to discover the causes of diseases and remove them than
 administer a doubtful remedy.       He sought for nothing but trnth,
 and therefore stated his opinions fearlessly ; it happened in con
 sequence that during his lectures at the College of Physicians, he
 drew from the President remarks which almost amounted to a
 reproof for the manner in which he spoke of medicines generally.
  He was much endeared to his friends owing to the honesty, purity,
 and simplicity of his character.     With his artistic nature and intel
 lectual endowments he combined the highest moral qualities. He
 was thus an ornament to the medical profession, which has gained
 in strength in every way by his membership.
                                                                S. W.

                                      X1U
     Sir John   Tomes was born in 1815, and died at Caterham, where he
had for many years resided, on July 29 of this year.
     Although his father was a man of high intellectual attainments,
and was deeply versed in the metaphysical literature of his day,
neither he nor any other member of the family had ever shown any
bent in the direction of biological or medical science.      Nevertheless,
Sir John in his boyhood acquired a good knowledge of field natural
history, to which he was partly led by being a most enthusiastic
sportsman, a taste which lasted the whole of his life, and he early
decided to take up the profession of medicine.
     With this in view, he was apprenticed to a hard-riding, hard-
drinking country practitioner of the old school, and after acquiring
a, rough and ready acquaintance with the practice of that period, he
•came to London and entered at the Middlesex and King's College,
 in 1836, where he became acquainted with Todd, Bowman, Kiernan,
 Quekett, Carpenter, Edward Forbes, and with almost all of the band
•of workers in histology who were then rising into notice.
      In a fragmentary diary which he then kept he is found spending hi&
•evenings with one or other of these friends, and, whilst living upon
-scanty means, purchasing a microscope of Powell (afterwards Powell
 and Lealand).
      Owing to the scarcity of competent men, it happened that he spent
  two years as house surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital, and during
  this period he fed a nest of young sparrows and a sucking-pig upon
  madder ; the sections' of their bones still exist, and are as good as
  any sections of hard tissues that have been since made with all the
  improved appliances of modern times.
      Whilst house surgeon he had a great many teeth to extract, and
  finding the instruments then in vogue clumsy and ill-adapted to the
  purpose, ho invented the forceps now in universal use the world
 -over. His marked mechanical ability led the late Sir Thomas Watson
 and the late Mr. Arnott to advise him to adopt dental surgery as his
  profession, and in doing so his attention became especially directed
  to the histology of teeth and bone, with which thenceforward his
   scientific researches were almost exclusively concerned.
       In 1849 he contributed a paper upon the structure of the dental
   tissues of the Marsupialia, and in the following year one upon the
   dental tissues of Rodentia, which were published in the ' Phil.
  Trans.'      In 1852 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and
   in the same year communicated an important paper, written in con
   junction with his intimate friend the late Campbell de Morgan, upon
  the structure and development of bone.       In 1856 he discovered the
  existence of the soft fibrils in dentine, which have since been known
                                                       '
  .as Tomes' fibrils ; this paper also appeared in the   Phil. Trans.'
       Besides these papers, he made numerous communications to the

                                      XIV
Microscopical Society, of which he was one of the earliest members,
and to other periodicals.       His work has stood the test of time, and,
like that of his friend      Bowman,   remains to this day in all essentials
unshaken. It is very remarkable that the work of these early inves
tigators, working with instruments that nowadays would be thought
very imperfect, and with the methods of histological research all in
their infancy, were so accurate and sound as time has proved them to
ll a ve been.
    Although this is not the place in which to speak at any length of
his work in the field of dental surgery, yet no notice of his life
would be at all complete without some mention of that to which his
energies in middle and later life were so largely devoted.         Having,
by his lectures on dental surgery and physiology, inaugurated the
scientific teaching of the subject, he worked on with unfailing tact,
singleness of purpose, and pertinacity, to improve the education of)
and to get recognition for, dental surgeons.
    It was to his efforts, far more than to those of any other person, that
the institution of an examination and the conferring of a diploma bv
the Royal College of Surgeons was due ; and this effected, the subse
quent passage of a Bill regulating the practice of dental surgery
through the House of Commons was his next aim. This, largely owing-
to Sir John Lubbock's warm espousal of the cause, was successfully
 done in 1878.      His efforts won the fullest recognition from the
 members of his own profession, with whom his influence was almost
 unbounded, and in 1883 the Royal College of Surgeons exercised
 their right of conferring the Honorary Fellowship of the College by
electing the late Professor Huxley and Mr. Tomes. In 1886 he was
 offered the honour of knighthood, which, though caring little for
 such distinction personally, he deemed it his duty to accept as an
 honour to his profession.
     His methods, whether in scientific or public matters, were never
 controversial, and he was one of those few people able to fullv
 retain the friendship and liking of those from whom he might hav<,
 occasion to differ most strongly.        Through never having enjoyed
 robust health, he was little seen in social gatherings ; nevertheless,
 he lived to see the accomplishment of almost all that he had worked
 for, and passed away in the fulness of years and the enjoyment of all
 his faculties.

     Hexrt Austin Bruce, Lord Aberdare, whose death occurred on
 February 25, 1895, was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on
 becoming a Privy Councillor in 1804.
     Ho was born on April 16, 1815 ; and was called to the Bar in 1887.
 In 1846 he was appointed Stipendiary Magistrate at Merthyr, which

post he resigned in order to enter Parliament as member for that
borough in 1852.    He held this seat for sixteen years. At the
General Election of 1^68 he was defeated ; but soon afterwards he
 was offered a seat in Renfrewshire, which he held for five years.
   In 1&62 Lord Palmerston selected Mr. Bruce for the post of Under-
Secretary of State for the Home Department, and in 1864 he became
Vice-President of the Committee of Council of Education.
   On the formation of Mr. Gladstone's Government in 18G8, Mr.
Bruce became Secretary of State for the Home Department, and, in
 1873, Lord Piesident of the Council, being at the same time raised to
the Peerage.
   After the fall of Mr. Gladstone's Government he ceased to take an
 active part in political life, and devoted himself chiefly to social and
 educational questions, in which he had always shown a deep interest.
 In 1875 he presided at the meeting of the Social Science Congress at
Brighton, and chose for the subject of his address, "Crime and its
Remedies."
    In 1859 he became a Fellow of the Geographical Society, and, in
 1880, was elected President of that Society, an office which he held —
 with the exception of one year — till 1887.
  Lord Aberdare was President of the University Colleges of
Aberystwyth and Cardiff, and took nn active part in the foundation
of the University of Wales, of which he was nominated the first
Chancellor.

Killinajjh, county Westmeath. He was educated at the Royal School
of Ennv-killcn and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated
B.A. in 1866, M.B. and M.Ch. in 1867, and M.A. in 1875. He was
fiist Senior Moderator and first Gold Medallist in Experimental
and Natural Science, Classical Hononrman andStearnes Exhibitioner,

 Army Mdical Service in 1808, and retired in 1888, with the rank of
Suigeon -Major.    His " Essay on the Diagnosis and Pathology of the
 Injuries and Diseases of the Shoulder- joint," was awarded the Gold

 '
   Medical Hints to Travellers,' published by the Royal Geograpieal
 Society, which reached a sixth edition in 1889. Bat the work by
which he will be best remembered in the annals of science, and
which formed the main occupation of twenty years of his life (from
 1871 to 1891) was his laborious and painstaking investigation into
the structure and classification of two groups of mammals, the
 Chiroptera and the Insectivora, on both of which he became the
recognised authority of his time. While stationed in India in his pro
fessional capacity, he availed himself of every opportunity to study
the bats of that region. His first published paper on them was
entitled " On four new species of Malayan Bats from the collection of
Dr. Stoliczka," which appeared in the 'Proceedings of the Asiatic
Society of Bengal,' for 1871. This was followed by numerous memoirs
upon various members of the group in the same journal, and in the
'Proceedings    of the Zoological Society,' and the 'Annals and
Magaziue of Natural History.' In 1876 the trustees of the Indian
Museum, brought out his systematic and copiously illustrated work,
   '
a Monograph of the Asiatic Cbiropten.'         This led, on his return
to England, to his engagement by the trustees of the British
Museum to undertake a still more important work called a ' Cata
logue of the Chiroptera in the Collection of the British Museum."
This is in reality a complete monograph of the order as far as the
materials then available permitted, and soill remains ths standard
work on the anatomy, classification, and nomenclature of bits,
although the 400 species described in it have been considerably
added to by subsequent investigators.        Dr. Dobsan's appointment
to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Netley, where he was placed in
charge of the museum, gave him further facilitities for pursuing hia
zoological studies, for which he frequently expressed his obligations
to the then Director-General of the Army Medical Department, Sir
William Muir. About this time he began to extend hi* range of
observation to other groups of mammals, and took up some interest
ing investigations into muscular anatomy, which resulted in an im-.
                " On the

the Feat of Mammalia, with remirks on tho value of their leading
modifications in classification," published in the ' Journal of Anatomy
 and Physiology,' 1883.
     Having in the British Museum. Catalogue exhausted all the
material then available for working at the Chiroptera, he undertook
 another and allied order, the Insectivora, and was doing excellent
service in elucidating the most interesting points in the structure of
its members, and unravelling the difficulties of thuir synomymy. He
wrote several valuable articles in the ninth edition of the ' Encyclo
paedia Britannica,'   which were afterwards incorporated in Flower

                                   XVII
and Lydekker's ' Introduction to the Study of Mammals (1891), but
he mainly concentrated himself upon a work which, if completed,
would have ranked as one of the most thorough and exhaustive
treatises on any group of mammals in existence.       The publication of
      '
his     Monograph of the Insectivora, Systematic and Anatomical,'
commenced in 1882, was unhappily interrupted before it was quite
finished by a slow, insidious, and ultimately fatal illness, which com
pelled him not only to give up his position as an army surgeon, but
also to abandon all scientific work, and to live for several years in
complete retirement, gradually failing in strength until death inter
vened on November 26, 1895. Thus was lost to science one who, in
his too short career, had proved himself an industrious, careful, and
conscientious worker, and whose upright and amiable character had
won for him the sincere esteem of all who were brought into personal
contact with him. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society
in 1883, and was a corresponding member of the Academy of Natural
Sciences of Philadelphia and of the Biological Society of Washington.
                                                            W. H. F.
   Hermann von Helmholtz was born in Potsdam, on August 31,
1821.     His father was a Professor of Literature in the Gymnasium of
that town. His mother, whose maiden name was Caroline Penne,
was of English descent, and was connected with the founder of
Pennsylvania.     For the first seven years of his life he was delicate,
but during these early tronbles, and throughout his boyhood, his
parents tended him with the most unremitting attention and affec
tion.
     In  the well known ' Autobiographical Sketch,' contained in an
address delivered in 1891, on the occasion of the attainment of his
seventieth year, an interesting account of his mental development
was given by von Helmholtz himself.
   He went to school at the Gymnasium in which his father taughtt
and, as he himself thought, found unusual difficulty in mastering
and remembering " disconnected things," such as " irregular gram
matical forms, and peculiar terms of expression."       " To learn prose
by heart was martyrdom."        Whether this defect was or was not as
great as von Helmholtz supposed, he appears to have had an unusually
good memory for things which he cared about, and to have had the
gift of caring chiefly for the best. He could repeat whole
                                                                 " books
of the Odyssey, a considerable number of the odes of Horace, and
large stores of German poetry."
     In the study of science, " the laws of phenomena " afforded the
conecting link which his memory needed.          He gained his earliest
knowledge of geometry by playing with wooden blocks, but the first
fragments of physics which he learned in the Gymnasium exerted

upon him an attraction greater than that of pure geometry or algebra.
By the time that the lad was of age to go to the University his
interest in physics had developed             iuto " an absorbing impulse,
amounting even to a passion."
     As, however, a livelihood could not be gained from a knowledge
of that branch of science, his father advised him to undertake the
study of medicine, a sensible proposal, to which the younger man
assented without much difficulty.        He therefore entered the Friedrich-
Wilhelm Institute, a military medical school, in which the poorer
students were materially aided while preparing for their future pro
fession. He was thus led to take an interest in physiology, and was
fortunate in that he came under the immediate influence of Johannes
Miiller.      Among his fellow students were E. du Bois-Reymond,
E. Briicke, C. Ludwig, and Virchow.
   His career as a student and teacher, brilliant as it was, may be dis
missed in a few words.
   In 1848 he was permitted to withdraw from the Army Medical
Service, and was appointed Teacher of Anatomy in the Academy of
Arts, in Berlin.        Only another year elapsed before he received the
more important appointment of Professor of Pathology and Physi
ology in Konigsberg.           This was followed by the Professorship of
Anatomy in Bonn (1855), of Physiology in Heidelberg (1858), and
of Physics in Berlin (1871). During the last years of his life he
held one of the highest posts to which any scientific man in Germany
can aspire. He was Director of the new " Physikalisch-Technische
                    "
Reichsanstalt         at Berlin.
   Amid this unruffled professional success, Helmholtz published a
long series of papers and books.           It has been said that as each of
seven cities contended for Homer, so seven sciences, mathematics,
physics, chemistry, physiology, medicine, philosophy, and aesthetics
claimed Helmholtz for their own,* and it is interesting to note how-
early he took the comprehensive view of science which justifies this
rhetorical statement.
   His first paper (apart from an inaugural dissertation) showed a
clear appreciation of the necessity of distinguishing vital from non-
vital phenomena.          In this memoir, published in 1843, he proved the
two negative propositions, that fermentation and decay are not merely
chemical processes due to the oxygen of the air, and that they are
not propagated by dissolved substances which can diffuse through a
porous membrane. He concluded that they resembled vital phenomena
" by the similarity of the materials in which they occur, by the mode
in which they spread, and by the similarity of conditions which are
essential for their preservation or for their destruction."         It is evi-

dent that in 1843 the young doctor was on the track which Pastenr
has since followed with such marvellous success.
    But though the first work of Helmholtz was to prove that the
intervention of life was essential to produce certain results which had
been wrongly ascribed to direct chemical action, he was soon occupied
with a group of converse propositions which show that the action of
life itself is subject to the laws of mechanics, physics, and chemistry.
The celebrated essay on the " Conservation of Force," or as we
should now call it the " conservation of energy," was published in
1847.     Helmholtz was led to the discussion of this subject by reflec
tions of the nature of " vital force."    He had convinced himself that
if it were   true that  living organisms could restrain or liberate the
action of chemical and physical forces, perpetual motion would be
realised. This compelled him to ask what relations must exist
between the various kinds of natural forces for perpetual motion to
 bo possible, and then to enquire if these relations actually exist.
    The argument, though addressed to physicists, was intended for
 the benefit of physiologists.     The first part is devoted to a proof
                                "
 that if all natural forces are central," i.e., act towards fixed centres,
 and depend solely on the distances and masses of the mutually
 reacting bodies, the law of the conservation of energy must hold
 good. The latter part of the paper is a masterly discussion of the
 application of the law to the different branches of experimental
 science.   It is unnecessary to trace these applications in detail, or to
 define precisely with respect to each of them the relative positions of
 Helmholtz and of his most distinguished contemporaries.        The essay
 is worthy of such minute discussion, but its value is to be judged
 chiefly by the effect it produced. Though von Helmholtz was not
 an originator of the doctrine of the conservation of energy ; though
 when his essay was written he knew little of Joule, and nothing of
 Mayer, he viewed the whole question from a standpoint far in
 advance of the majority of the scientific men of that day.            His
                                    '
 paper was refused admission to Poggendorff's Annalen,' and he has
 told us that Karl Jacobi was his only supporter among the older
 members of the Physical Society of Berlin. The result of a sharp
 struggle was entirely in favour of the young doctor.             William
 Thomson, in England, and Helmholtz, in Germany, within a few
 weeks, compelled their respective countrymen to listen to, and before
 long to accept, the doctrine that energy, like matter, can neither
 be created nor destroyed, that though protean in form, it is unchange
 able in quantity.      The last application of this principle was cha

 to the doctrine of the conservation of energy ; the last of the ques

     No scientific career, however, can be fruitful which is devoted
  exclusively to the cultivation of wide generalisations.        The success
  of his essay did not tempt Helmholtz to stray into the easy path
  of speculation.      Profoundly conscious of the importance of general
  principles, he nevertheless felt that the surest way to gain true
  knowledge of the relations between mechanics and life was to investi
  gate the mechanism of living bodies in detail.            He had already
  (1845)    studied   the  chemical  changes   which  accompany muscular
  activity by showing that both the aqueous and alcoholic extracts of
  the muscles of a frog's leg were different, according as it had, or had
  not, been stimulated by a long series of electrical discharges. To
 this was added, in 1847, a memoir on the production of heat during
 muscular action. It had been held that the increase of temperature
 in an irritated muscle is due to the more rapid supply of arterial
 blood. Experiments to test this view had been mado on warm
 blooded animals, but Helmholtz pointed out that less elevated tem
 perature and persistent irritability were qualities which made the
 muscles of the frog more fitted to be the subjects of a crucial experi
 ment. He succeeded in proving that the rise in temperature is due
 to work within the muscle itself, and that the amount of heat thus
 evolved is far greater than any which may be generated in the nerves
 through which the stimulation is produced.
    From these investigations Helmholtz passed to another difficult
 problem namely that of the rate of propagation of nervous action.         It
 had been thought that this was practically instantaneous, but in a paper
 published in 1850 he proved that if two different points of a motor
 nerve are equally stimulated, the interval of time that elapses before
 any given stage of the resulting muscular contraction is reached is
 greater as the point of stimulation is more distant from the muscle.
 The lag thus detected was very small, being less than two thou
 sandths of a second on the short lengths of nerve employed, but the
velocity of propagation, instead of being infinitely great, was found
to be less than a tenth of the velocity of sound, the most probable
value being 26*4 metre-seconds.
    Various problems connected with this research continued to-
occupy the mind of Helmholtz for some time. In 1850 he discussed
the " Methods of measuring very small intervals of time, and their
application to physiological purposes."        This was followed in 1851
by a memoir on the duration of induced electrical currents, and in
1852 by a further investigation, conducted with improved apparatus,
into the velocity of the propagation of nervous action. The result
was 27-25 metre-seconds, thus confirming the substantial accuracy of
his earlier work.
   Helr:5ua<;htIU8s3 thus opened up an entirely new field of research, which

         I

                                      XXI
smaller man. Nevertheless, while these investigations were progress
ing, he found time to invent the ophthalmoscope (1851), to begin his
observations on compound colours (1852) and to write an elaborate
essay on the nature of sense impressions (1852).
   Thus, in 1852, at thirty-one years of age, Helmholtz had surveyed
a large part of the wide field in which he was to achieve so much.
His life work lay mapped ont before him. He had already shown
the extraordinary many-sidedness which was the most remarkable
characteristic of his genius, and had entered upon most of the in
quiries in the prosecution of which his fame was to be won. If an
exception is to be made to this statement, it is that in 1852 Helmholtz
had hardly given to the world a proof of the mathematical ability
which was afterwards to solve the problem of vortex motion.
   It would be impossible in a notice of this kind to enter into any
detailed account of his investigations, or to discuss critically the
arguments for and against theoretical views which have not in all
instances commanded universal assent.             The most that can be
attempted    is to give as briefly as  possible a catalogue raisonne of his
principal achievements.
   The measurement of the velocity of propagation of nervous action,
was probably his most important work in the domain of experi
mental physiology.      He returned to this subject, and about the year
1870 wrote several papers in conjunction with Herr Baxt on questions
suggested by it. The original investigation was extended so as to
include observations on the living human subject, the measurement
of differences in the speed of transmission in different parts of the
body, and the effects of temperature. In another memoir published
in 1871, Helmholtz discussed experiments, conducted in the labora
tory at Heidelberg by Herr Baxt, on the interval of time which
elapses between the presentation of a visible object to the eye and
the production of the sense-impression to which it gives rise.
   In 1864 and 1866 he published two papers on the sound which a
muscle emits when contracted.       In the first of these he showed that
if the muscle be stimulated by intermittent electrical shocks the
sound given ont corresponds in pitch to the frequency of the stimula
tions. In the second he determined the correct pitch of the sound
given out by muscles, contracting naturally under the influence of
volitional impulses, by communicating the vibrations of the muscle
to springs or to paper strips.          He found that these responded
best when their natural period was from 1/18 to 1/20 of a second.
This was important as showing that observers who had stated that
the natural muscle sound corresponded to from thirty-six to forty
vibrations per second had heard the octave of the true fundamental
which was itself below the lower limit of audition.

                                   xxn
optics were closely intertwined. In his collected works twenty-fonr
papers are included under these heads, but most of his conclusions
are published in his ' Handbuch der Physiologischen Optik.' The
first edition of this great work was completed in 1866.      Another was
passing through the press at the time of the author's death.
    Adhering approximately to the chronological order of his inquiries
into these subjects, the two first were devoted to the ophthalmoscope
and to colour mixtures respectively.
   The problem of how to see the interior of the eye did not involve
any novel or recondite principles, but was practically extremely diffi
cult. A hint as to the method of solution was obtained from the
recorded fact that an observer, wearing spectacles, noticed that a
friend's eye appeared to him to glitter when light was reflected into
it from his own glasses. The account which Helmholtz gave of the
invention of the instrument, to the construction of which this
afforded the clue, is a model of the combination of mathematics and
experiment to attain a practical result.
   A modification of the original ophthalmoscope devised by Th.
Ruete, in which the observer looks through a hole in the middle of a
mirror, is that now used by oculists. ' Helmholtz published a paper
on this form of the instrument, but though he regarded it as the best
for medical purposes, he preferred the earlier type for research.
   On the theory of mixed colours and the closely related problem of
colour blindness, Helmholtz does not seem to have held with perti
nacity the views generally attributed to him, to which, no doubt, he
at one time inclined.
   In his earliest experiments he combined the spectra produced by
two slits inclined in opposite directions at 45° to the vertical. He
concluded that at least five colours, viz., red, yellow, green, blue, and
violet, were necessary if all the colours of the spectrum were to be
matched     by compound tints, but that if three only were to be
selected the best choice was that of Thomas Young, viz., red, green,
and violet.    He also explained the reasons why the tints resulting
from a mixture of coloured powders are different from those pro
duced by mingling rays of homogeneous light.             Later and more
refined experiments led him to adopt unreservedly the theory of three
fundamental colours.
   He rejected Brewster's view that three kinds of light — red, green,
and blue, co-exist in each homogeneous        ray.    The explanation of
compound colours as due to the mixture of three fundamental tints
could only be understood as applied to subjective phenomena not as
describing external physical facts. It is the reduction of colour sensa
tions to a mixture of three fundamental sensations, not the analysis
of light waves into three fundamentally different types of vibration.
   " In this sense," he said, " Thomas
                                       Young solved the problem cor

                                   XX111
rectly, and in fact his assumption gives an extraordinarily simple and
clear view and explanation of all the phenomena of the physiological
theory of colours" (' Phys. Opt.,' 1867, p. 291).          So much was
Young in advance of his age       that   his theory was   hardly noticed,
" bis ich selbst und Maxwell wieder auf sie aufmerksam machten "
(' Phys. Opt.,' 1867, p. 307).
    From this standpoint von Helmholtz did not recede ; but in his
later years he was impressed with the difficulties which attend the
explanation of colour blindness on the hypothesis that in such cases
one of the three fundamental sensations is weakened or absent.
    In  the twentieth appendix to the first edition of the ' Physiolo-
                '
gische Optik he proved that he did not even at that date (1867) con
sider this to be the only possible explanation, but that the phenomena
of colour blindness might be due to the fact that the forms of the
intensity curves of the three fundamental colours were abnormal,
rather than to an incapacity to appreciate one of the fundamental
sensations.
    It is unnecessary to discuss here the modifications of his earlier
views of which there are proofs in the latest edition of the great work
on optics.    In January, 1893, a very interesting comparison of the
                                                                   '
opinions expressed in the two editions was contributed to the Philo
                     '
sophical Magazine      by Dr. W. Pole, F.R.S., who is himself a type
case of, and an authority on, colour blindness.      It is therefore suffi
cient to say that von Helmholtz gave a new determination of the
three fundamental colours, which were found to be red, green, and
blue, but to be very much more saturated than any colour which
occurs in the spectrum.       His final word on the subject of colour
blindness was that according to his latest " generalisation of the
theory of dichromic vision we get rid of the separation of the green-
blind and red-blind into two sharply divided classes, a separation
which does not appear to have been completely established by obser
vation. It is also shown that the want of correspondence          between
the absent colour of the dichromic system, and one of the funda
mental colours found by us, does not involve any insoluble contra
 diction."
    In  1853 Helmholtz communicated to the Academy of Berlin a pre
 liminary note
                  " On a hitherto unknown alteration in the Human
 Eye during a change of Accommodation."         He was at that time im
perfectly acquainted with researches which had recently been made
 on the same subject by others, and in his full paper, which was not
 published till 1856, he frankly admitted that he had been anticipated
 in several points.    In finish and delicacy, however, his work far
 exceeded that of his predecessors,   to which, moreover, he made some
 important additions.    He invented the ophthalmometer for measur
 ing the changes in the magnitudes of the images formed by reflec

                                  XXIV
tion at the surfaces of the cornea and the crystalline lens. This
instrument could not easily be applied to the faint image formed by
the front surface of the crystalline lens, and he devised ingenious
methods of indirect measurement by comparing the image with that
produced at the surface of the cornea by a weaker source of light.
    These observations are classic and placed the explanation of the
mechanism of accommodation on a firm basis.         They were followed
by many others described either in memoirs or in the great work on
                         '
   Physiologische Optik which appeared in parts between the years
*
1856 and 1866.     The geometry of the movements of the eye was dis
cussed iin 1863.     Three papers were devoted to the form of the
Horopter, or locus of points the images of which are formed on
" corresponding points " of the two retinae. Helmholtz also devoted
much time to the study of after images, to contrast phenomena, to
the theory of binocular vision, and to the relations between the con
vergence of the eyes and the sense of distance.
    A masterly memoir, published in 1874, contained by far the most
satisfactory explanation of anomalous dispersion that had, up to that
time, been given.
    Attempts had been made by Sellmeier and Ketteler, to solve the
problem on the hypothesis that material particles are set in motion
by the ether. No retarding or frictional forces were introduced and
thus difficulties arose when the periods of the material and ethereal
vibrations were identical.     On the other hand, 0. E. Meyer had
postulated a viscous ether, but had not introduced the material par
ticles. Helmholtz combined the two hypotheses by assuming a
frictional resistance to the motions of atomic matter, which was
supposed to be mingled with the ether.              The agreement of
the results with experiment was sufficiently good to prove that
whatever changes may be made in our conception of the mechanical
relations between the ether and matter, the equations deduced from
 the assumptions of von Helmholtz are a close approximation to a
 satisfactory mathematical expression of the phenomena.
    The acoustical work of Helmholtz is more accessible to the
 English reader than his researches on optics, for, whereas the
 '                         '
   Physiologische Optik has not been translated, the great com
                '                                      '
panion book Die Lehre von den Tonempfindungen            was done into
 English by the late Alexander   Ellis, F.R.S., and was enriched by the
notes and appendices added by the accomplished translator with the
 author's consent.
    The first part of the ' Tonempfindungen ' was chiefly devoted to
 harmonic upper partials.    It was shown that they " are not, as was
 hitherto thought, isolated phenomena of small importance, but that,
 with very few exceptions, they determine the qualities of tone of
 almost all instruments, and are of the greatest importance for those

                                     XXV
•qualities of tone which are best adapted for musical purposes."          In
connection with this subject special mathematical and experimental
researches were instituted on the various modes of producing musical
sounds. The theory of oscillations in open tubes was discussed
from the point of view of the velocity potential, the mode of treat
ment being at that date (1859) of a very advanced type. Another
 interesting investigation threw a flood of light on the behaviour of
 "violin strings. A bright point on the string was observed through a
 microscope the object glass of which was attached to the prong of a
 tuning fork and vibrated parallel to the string. A study of the
"curves produced by the luminous point led to the discovery that
  the motion which produces the fundamental vibration consists of a
  displacement at uniform speed in one direction, and a return move
  ment, at another constant velocity, to the original point of
 departure.
      From problems suoh     as these Helmholtz   passed   to the study of
   vowel sounds.    In his view the mouth when adjusted to produce a
  particular vowel resounds to a particular note, and the quality of
   the sound is determined by the tendency to reinforce that note. He
 constructed the well-known apparatus for the synthesis of vowel
   sounds, and arrived at the important generalisation that the quality
 -of a sound depends only on the intensities of the harmonics and not
  upon their relative phases.
      But, as in the case of optics, Helmholtz was not content without
   following up the external physical phenomena to the point where
  they affect the nerves.        He published several papers on the
  anatomy of the ear, and developed a theory as to the mechanism by
  which the appreciation of musical pitch is developed in that organ.
   In the first edition of his work (published in 1863) it was to the
  fibres of Corti that he looked for the origin of this sense, but as it was
   afterwards proved that they are absent in birds and amphibia,
   Helmholtz concluded that it is probably " the breadth of the
  membrana basilaris of the cochlea which determines the tuning."
      The second part of the ' Tonempfindungen ' was devoted to the
   theory of consonance.    Helmholtz explained the dissonance of com
   pound  tones as caused  by beats between the fundamentals or some of
   the more important partials.    In the case of simple tones the neces
  sary means of discrimination was found in beats due to the presence
  -of combination tones.     Of these Helmholtz discovered the summa
  tion tone, and though holding that under favourable condi
   tions, which depend upon the mode of production of the notes, the
  combination tones are objective, he developed a theory of their
   formation in the ear depending on the asymmetry of the vibrations
  of the drum-skin.     Somewhat lengthy controversies have arisen on
   several of these points into which this is not the place to enter, but

                                    XXVI
even   if some of the views of Helmholtz should hereafter be decisively
rejected, his work on the theory of sound will always stand out in
the history of the science as the first great attempt to explain the
foundations of music by the laws of acoustics and by the construction
                                                                          *
of the ear. The discussion was extended in the ' Tonempfindungen
from the cause of dissonance to the theory of musical scales ; a
natural relationship between the tones being sought, as before, in
the relationship of their partials.
   But though he maintained that these theories explained the physical
" reason of the melodic relationship of two tones," the author of the
'                     '
  Tonempfindungen was careful to point out that the principles he
enunciated had not always determined the structure of the scale and
do not determine it everywhere now. The selection of a series of
notes, which were afterwards found to obey certain natural laws, was
voluntary.     The scale itself is not natural in the sense that it is not
n necessary    consequence    of the construction of the ear ; on the
contrary, it is the product of artistic invention.    Thus music is not a
mere branch of mechanics, but an art.        The architect and the com
poser alike   deal with  materials  which are subject to mechanical laws,
but they are alike free to fashion from them forms determined, not
by calculation, but by the sense of beauty.
   In the subjects which have been noticed experiment was used by
Helmholtz at least as much as mathematics. In his researches on
vortex motion and electricity the mathematical powers of his genius
were predominant.
   The great paper on vortex motion made an extraordinary advance
in the theory of the movement of perfect fluids, a subject which had
already attracted the keen scrutiny of the greatest mathematicians.
It is to Helmholtz that we owe the discovery of the fundamental
laws which govern vortex motion, and of those peculiar qualities
which have made it play so large a part in theories as to the con
stitution of matter and of the ether.
   The electrical work of Helmholtz began early, and extended over
many years.     An important paper, published in 1851, on the duration
of induced electrical currents, has been already referred to. It was
a bye-product of his researches on the propagation of nervous action.
    In 1869 he published an account of some experiments on electrical
oscillations.   A falling pendulum completed two circuits at times
separated by a very small though measurable interval.          Electrical
oscillations were thus induced in a secondary circuit, the terminals
of which were connected with the coatings of a Leyden jar. Imme
diately afterwards the secondary circuit was itself broken, and at the
same instant it was connected with a shunt which led through the
nerve of a frog's leg. As the time between the completing of the
primary and the breaking of the secondary circuit was increased in

                                    xxvn
successive experiments, alternations in the violence of the twitchings.
of the muscle were noticed, and in all forty-five maxima were
observed.     Helmholtz claimed for this method the advantage that
the electrical oscillations were established on an unbroken conductor
between the coatings of the jar, so that no spark was produced.
     Two years later (1871) he returned to the same subject, and
determined an inferior limit to the rate of propagation of electro
magnetic induction.       Blaserna had published some experiments, from
which he concluded that in air this velocity was only 550 metre-
seconds. Helmholtz then proceeded to investigate the matter for
himself, using, with some modifications, the apparatus described above.
It   is evident that if the time interval between the breaking of the
two currents were adjusted so as to give the maximum effect, the
same result would only be obtained when the distance between the
two circuits was increased, if the time interval were itself augmented
by an amount equal to that required for the induction to travel
 across the additional space. Helmholtz found that the same adjust
 ment was equally good at all distances, and concluded that the
 velocity of propagation must exceed 314,400 metre-seconds. These
 experiments acquire an additional interest when we remember that
 Hertz was a pupil of von Helmholtz, and was thus brought up in a
 laboratory in which electrical oscillations had been the subject of
 careful study. The seed sown by the earlier efforts of the master-
 brought forth fruit a hnndred-fold.
     From 1870 onwards, Helmholtz published an important series of
 papers on the theory of electro-dynamics.        His point of departure
 was the discussion of the mutual action of two current elements.
 An expression for the potential of two such elements had been
 formulated by F. E. Neumann, which differed from those deduced
 from the theories of W. Weber and Clerk Maxwell respectively.          All
 three gave identical results in the case of closed circuits.
     Taking the elder Neumann's formula as the groundwork of his-
 investigations, Helmholtz sought to find the terms which must be
  added to it, so as to produce the most general expression consistent
  with the known behaviour of closed circuits.        The result was an
  expression consisting    of the sum  of two  terms, which were multi
                                      —
  plied respectively by 1 + k and 1 k, where k is an undetermined
  constant.
     The expression is equivalent to that given by Weber when k = — lr
 to that given by F. B. Neumann when k = 1, and is in accord with
 Maxwell's theory when A; = 0.
     It was then proved that if k is negative the equilibrium of elec
  tricity at rest must be unstable, so that motion, when once estab
  lished, would increase of its own accord, and lead to infinite velocities
  aud densities.   The assumption was, in fact, a violation of the law of

                                 XXVU1
tho conservation of energy in the sense that two electrified particles
starting with a finite velocity would within a finite distance acquire
infinite speed, and therefore infinite energy.
   An account of the controversy which followed on the publication
of this view has been given by Maxwell. It is, therefore, sufficient
to say that Helmholtz maintained his position against all attacks.
    It remained, however, to discuss tho case when k was equal to    or
greater than zero.     The most interesting part of this investigation
was the application of the generalised formula to the propagation    of
electrical and magnetic disturbances through bodies capable of
electrical or magnetic polarisation.    These properties were treated,
independently.     The conclusions arrived at may be summed up as
follows.
    Both longitudinal and transversal electric disturbances can be
propagated in unmagnetisable dielectrics. The velocity of the trans
versal undulations in air depends on the absolute susceptibility of the
medium. If this is very large the velocity is the same as that of
light. The velocity of the longitudinal waves is equal to that of the
transversal waves multiplied by the factor lj^k and by a constant
which depends on the magnetic constitution of the air.          In con
ductors the waves are rapidly damped. If the insulator is magnetis-
able, the magnetic longitudinal oscillations have an infinite velocity,
the transversal magnetic oscillations are perpendicular to the trans
versal electrical oscillations, and are propagated with the same
velocity.
    In the particular cases when k = 0 the longitudinal waves of
electricity have also an infinite velocity, and the theory is then in
close accord with that of Maxwell, provided that the absolute specific
inductive capacity of the air is great enough to make the common
velocity of the electrical and magnetic transversal undulations equal
to that of light.
    The paper, of which an account has just been given, was entitled
" On the Equations of Motion of Electricity in Conductors at Rest,"
and was described by Maxwell as " very powerful."      It was followed
 four years later (1874) by a memoir, in which the theory was applied
 to conductors in motion, and by several others of a more or less
controversial character.
    An interesting result of the attention given by Helmholtz to the
 theory of electricity was a series of experiments, carried out in his
 laboratory by Professor Rowland, to determine whether the magnetic
 effects of an electric current were identical with those produced by
 the displacement of matter carrying an electrostatic charge. As
 these experiments were planned by Rowland, it must suffice to state
 that it was proved that a revolving charged conductor behaves like a
 ring-shaped electric current.

                                   XXIX
    Helmholtz also developed the theory of electrical double layers at
clie surfaces which separate two bodies of different potentials, and
i-^plied the theory to the explanation of electrical convection and
other phenomena.
   His views on galvanic    polarisation and electrolysis were expounded
in the Faraday Lectnre, delivered before the Royal Institution in
1881.
  In the year 1886 he published a paper " On the Physical Meaning
of the Principle of Least Action." This was the first of a series in
-which he extended the application of that principle to electro
dynamics.
     His last paper was  on this subject.    It was communicated to the
Academy    of Berlin  on June  14, 1894,  less than three months before
Lis death, and appears in his collected works as an unfinished
fragment. It is characteristic of the wide view which he took that
this final effort was an attempt to deduce the principles of electro
dynamics,
            " von Maxwell aufgestellten, von H. Hertz ausfuhrlicher
formulirten," from a generalised form of the principle of least
 action.
     An account of von Helmholtz would be incomplete without a
 reference, however brief, to his philosophical views.
     He adhered to the opinion that our senses convey to us only
 symbols of the truth.        In an eloquent passage (' Wissenschaftliche-
 Abhandlungen,'    ii,   p. 608) he declared that the sensations of light
 and    colour have  just as much and just as little relation to external
 facts as the name, or even the handwriting, of a man have to the
 man himself.      The only difference between the symbolism of speech
 and that of our senses    is   that the formeris   more or less arbitrary,
 while the latter   is    a universal language, without dialects, which
 nature prescribes.
     But von Helmholtz also held that our most fundamental concep
  tions are based not upon innate ideas, but upon the use of these
  inexplicable sensations, conveyed to us by organs which, though they
  tell us all we need to know, are from the instrument maker's point of
  view imperfect.     But while describing Kant's theory of the a priori
  origin of the geometrical axioms as
                                             " eine unerwiesene," " un-
  nothige," and
                   " giinzlich unbrauchbare Hypothese," he gave greater
  weight to the principles of mechanics, as enabling us to judge of the
  relations of real things. As soon as these principles, he said, " are
  conjoined with the axioms of geometry we obtained a system of pro
  positions which have real import              If such a system were to
  be taken as a   transcendental form of intuition and thought, a pre-
   established harmony between form and reality must be assumed."
     These and various other points, both scientific and philosophical,
   were discussed by von Helmholtz, not only in papers addressed to

                                    XXX
-expert    audiences,  but in successive series of luminous popular
lectures.
     Of the literary style in which all this was done, Professor Engel-
 mann must be allowed to speak.           " Besseres Deutsch ist niclir
 geschrieben worden. . Helmholtz' Sprache ist von vollendeter edelster
 Natilrlichkeit, von ruhigstem Flusse und gleichmassigem Wohllaut.
 Er liebt die kurze gerade Redeweise, verschmaht prunkvolle Worte
 und den hanfigen Gebrauch von Bildern und erhebt sich doch, wo
•es   der Gegenstand mit sich bringt, zu poetischer Warme des
 Ausdrucks."
     Such is a brief record of the more salient results of the work of
 von Helmholtz. If judged both by their variety and importance,
they have, perhaps, never been equalled. They secured for him in
 his lifetime the admiration and respect of the whole civilized world.
Honours were showered upon him. In particular, he was ennobled
 by the German Emperor, was a Foreign Member of the Royal
 Society, and in 1873 was awarded the Copley Medal.          He attained
 his seventieth year in 1891, and the occasion was celebrated in
Germany almost as a national festival, while outside the limits of the
                                                                "
 German Empire " learned societies," to quote his own words, spread
over the whole world, from Tomsk to Melbourne," expressed by-
 diplomas and addresses their sense of the importance of his scientific
 work.
     He outlived the celebration by three years only.         His death
 deprived the world of one of the most notable of the leaders of the
-science of the nineteenth century.
                                                            A. W. R.
     The death of Sir James Cockle removes from our midst a man
 -eminent as a lawyer and a judge, and no less eminent as a mathe
  matician. Of the work which he did, and the distinctions which he
 won at the bar and on the bench, something may be said here ; though
 he was known to us chiefly by his writings on subjects far removed
  from his professional life. He commenced his legal career fifty years
 ago as a special pleader, and on being called to the bar joined the
 Midland Circuit, where he gained the good opinion and esteem of all
 with whom he came in contact. He was especially admired for his
 justness of thought, clearness of view, refinement of mind, and eleva
 tion of character. These characteristics, combined with a sound
 knowledge of law and unwearied industry, eminently fitted him for
 the high position he was afterwards called to fill as first Chief
 Justice of Queensland. This advancement he owed to the influence
 of Sir William Erie, then Chief Justice of the Court of Common
  Pleas, who had formed a very favourable opinion of his capacity
 and character. Erie, on being applied to by the Colonial Office,

                                    XXXI
*' named " Cockle for the post " on account of the estimation and
regard in which he was held by the good men on his circuit."
      Cockle commenced    his judicial labours amid difficulties not of his
own creating, for they had arisen before his arrival in the Colony,
 and were in no way connected with any action of his, but by courtesy,
 tact, and decision, he speedily overcame them, and his subsequent
-course was comparatively smooth.          For fifteen years he presided
 over the Supreme Court of Queensland, and throughout the whole
 period he enjoyed the respect and confidence alike of his colleagues
 on the Bench, the members of the Bar, and the community in
 general.
      Chief Justice Erie, who watched his Australian career from the
  beginning to the end with interest and satisfaction, often testified
  to the excellence of his judicial administration.     " With
                                                                 regard to
  the duties of his office," he wrote to the Duke of Buckingham and
  Chandos when Cockle had been for some years at work in Queens
            I
  land, " am confident that he has done ' what to justice appertains
                      '
  according to law with zeal and ability, setting a good example of
  the dignity and motives which become the office. But, besides the
  •work included in his judicial contract, he has been indefatigable as
   a legislator, systematising the law there, and bringing it up to the
   best improvements here."       In this letter Erie enumerates some
  thirty statutes consolidated mainly by Sir James Cockle, and points
   to his endeavours to diffuse the culture which, as a Trinity (Cam
   bridge) man, strong in mathematics, he " imported " with him, and
   had " imparted in lectures and publications."        " He set out in
   troubled waters — from the clash of legislative and judicial powers —
   which were soon calmed by his discretion. I. have had much know
   ledge of judicial men, and I am sure the Queen has never had a
   servant who more thoroughly earned every farthing of the wages he
   hoped to receive."
      Equally emphatic testimony was given by men on the spot who had
   been long and intimately associated with Cockle in his judicial ad
   ministration.   When he was about to return to England, and before
   it was known that he intended to resign his official connexion with
   the Colony, the journalists of Queensland testified in warm terms to
   the general appreciation of his public services and private worth, and
   expressed the hope that his absence would be but of brief duration.
   And althongh seventeen years have since elapsed, Queensland still
   remembers with grateful feeling her first Chief Justice.      When the
   news of his death was cabled out to the colony, the daily papers gave
   immediate expression to the public sense of loss. The occasion served
   to revive old memories : the Judge, his dignified and courteous bear
   ing, his unwearied labours, the fidelity with which he dispensed
    justice according to law, his varied services to Queensland, the pro

                                    xxxn
  fundity of his learning, and his mathematical distinctions — all were
                           " No
  passed under review.          community could desire to build up their
  series of Chief Justices upon a more upright and steadier foundation-
 stone than the late Sir James Cockle."           (' Brisbane Telegraph,*
 January 30, 1895.) The following estimates of his character and
 work as a Judge are from the pens of his successors, both of whom
  had exceptional opportunities of knowing him in that capacity. Sir
 Charles Lilley, who was his colleagne on the Bench and succeeded
 him as Chief Justice, writes : —
     " Sir James Cockle's services to
                                       Queensland as Chief Justice were
 of a high order. He was an excellent lawyer, and the dignity and
 urbanity of his judicial presence upheld the tone and character of the
 Bench and Bar as one of the highest institutions of the country. He
 felt and manifested the feeling that his decisions should be absolutely
 just. At times those who observed his anxiety to give exact and
 righteous judgment, thought it savoured of weakness and hesitancy,
 but this was an entirely erroneous idea of his character and conduct.
 It arose from his settled idea that if by any labour of his own he
 could do right according to law, it was his duty to apply himself with
 diligence to the necessary task. He was fearless, and eminently suc
 cessful in his administration of the law, few appeals resulting from
 his decisions, and only two being successful during his fifteen years"
 presidency of the Supreme Court of the Colony as Chief Justice. He
 was courteous to the Bar, loyal and helpful to his colleagues on the
 Bench, and an example to the world of a righteous judge. He rendered
great service to the Colony by a consolidation of large portions of the
 statute law, especially of the criminal law, the mercantile law, consti
tutional law, and of the procedure of the courts. He took an interest
in the charitable institutions of the country, and for some years was
Chairman of the Brisbane Boys and Girls' Grammar Schools. He
was President for some time of the Queensland Philosophical Society.
Indeed he was one of its founders, and took an active part in its pro
ceedings by contributing some valuable papers, since included in a
publication collected from his contributions to several periodicals.
He rendered in many ways most important services to Queensland.
Not least was the example of his life as a Christian judge and
gentleman. My friend was a sincerely convinced Christian.        He had
satisfied himself of the truth and beauty of Christian Faith and Hope,
founding his belief on the proof of the great central miracle of the
Resurrection.     The news of his death was received with profound
regret throughout the Colony, and from the Bench of the Supreme
Court his life and services were eloquently eulogised by his suc
cessors.    I regard my own loss of my old friend as irreparable."

Attorney-General of Queensland, writes : — " The position of Sir James

  Cockle as the first Chief Justice of Queensland, was one of some
  difficulty. He was appointed ovor the head of Mr. Justice Lutwyche,
  an able and experienced lawyer, who had previously been the sole
  Judge of the Court, and who continued to receive for several years
  a considerably larger salary than the new Chief Justice.        No signs
  of any friction between them, if any existed, were, however, allowed
  to become manifest to the public.      The condition of the Bar, at
 first extremely small in numbers, and of the colony, which had been
 constituted at the end of 1859, and was very rapidly increasing in
 population and wealth, combined to render the office of the President
 of the Supreme Court one of special importance, it falling to his lot
 to a great extent to form, by precept and example, what were to be
 the future traditions of the Court, and to earn for the Bench that
 respect which, although generally associated by Englishmen with the
 administration of justice, was in the first instance acquired, and can
 only be maintained, by the personal qualities of the Judges.       In this
 task Sir James Cockle was eminently successful. He earned and
 enjoyed the most profound personal respect.          Implicit confidence
 was felt in his intense desire to administer justice with absolute
 impartiality.
    " His courtesy and kindness to the profession, especially to the
 junior members, who were without the advantage of training in
 English Courts, were admirable, as was, on the occasion of his death,
 pointed out by two of them who now occupy seats on the Supreme
 Court Bench.
    " His habit of accurate thinking was impressed upon his judg
ment, which erred, if at all, in being perhaps too laconic, just suffi
cient words being used to convey to a reasoning mind the logical
conclusion from the premises.     When sitting with juries, on the other
hand, it was sometimes complained of him that it was impossible
even to conjecture, from any indication of the inclination of his own
mind, on which side he thought the balance of probability lay, so
careful was he to avoid the appearance of partiality.
    " Essentially of a shy and retiring disposition, and perhaps diffi
dent of his own ability, he took little part in public affairs, except for
a time as Chairman of Trustees of the Brisbane Grammar School.
But this very aloofness was, probably, in the special circumstances
of the colony an advantage, in that it prevented any imputation,
always difficult to avoid in a small community, of undue friendship
between judges and suitors.      Of his ability as a sound and able
lawyer no douVit has ever been felt, and the still more important work
already referred to, of giving an initial direction to the administra
tion of justice in Queensland, and establishing a lofty standard of
dnty in the Courts, could not have been in better hands."

                                   XXXIV
  James Cockle was best known to us. Ho wrote on the Indian Astro
  nomical Literature, on the Indian Cycles and Lunar Calendar, on tht*
  date of the Vedas and Jyotish Sastra, and on the Ages of Garga and
  Parasara. He also published four elaborate memoirs on the Motion
  of Fluids, and some notes on Light under the Action of Magnetism,
  Ac., but in general he confined himself to problems in pure mathe
  matics. His analytical researches were concerned for the most part
  with two subjects, viz., Common Algebra and the Theory of Differ
  ential Equations.   In algebra he worked mainly among the higher
  equations, and for many years his labours in this department were
                                                               " solve the
  inspired and directed by the hope of being able to
  quintic," or, in other words, to express a root of the general equation
 of the fifth degree by a finite combination of radicals and rational
 functions.    The problem had long engaged the attention of mathe
 maticians, and was attacked by the most celebrated analysts of the
 last contury with great skill and vigour, but without success.      In tho
 early part of the present century, Abel, the young and gifted Nor
 wegian mathematician, attempted to show that a finite algebraic solu
 tion of the problem was impossible. Cockle considered the argument
  with care, and reproduced it as modified by Sir W. ft. Hamilton, in
 the ' Quarterly Journal of Mathematics' (vol. 5).      To prove a nega
 tive, however, is proverbially difficult, and despite Abel's " demon
 stration," and the non-success of preceding investigators, Cockle for
 many years clung to the conviction that what had been done for the
lower equations might be done also for the equation of the fifth degree.
 Ho laboured long and hard at the problem; and although he failed,
as others before him had failed, to effect a general solution, and camo
                                                              "
 finally to the conclusion that such a solution was             absolutely
unattainable," yet his labour was not lost. He found not the thing
he sought for, but other things which amply repaid the toil of effort,
and he opened up new methods of working, and new lines of research
which are of acknowledged value in themselves.         A result which he
obtained in the fifties attracted much attention at the time, on
account of its remai'kable simplicity.     By an indirect but ingenious
process he aucceeded in determining the explicit form of a certain
sextic equation on the solution of which that of the general quintic
may be shown to depend.       The accuracy of this sextic or " auxiliary"
equation (whose coefficients are all monomials save one, which is a
binomial) was shortly afterwards confirmed by an independent calcu
lation. The writer of this notice was led to consider the problem in
connection with some researches of his own on the finite solution of
algebraic equations, in the course of which he calculated Cockle's
sextic by a direct process.      His researches were published in the
'
   Memoirs of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society,' to
which Cockle had contributed his remarkable result, and the subject

                                   xxxv
 was followed up by the same writer in two papers on the " Theory of
Qnintics," in the ' Quarterly Journal of Mathematics,' and also in an
                                                                 " in the
exposition of Cockle's " method of symmetric products
'
   Phil. Trans.' for ISGO. The study of these papers led the late Pro
fessor Cayley to investigate the subject, and his results were embodied
in a memoir entitled " On a New Auxiliary Equation in the Theory
of Equations of the Fifth Order," which appeared in the 'Phil.
 Trans.' for 1861. Cockle had calculated the auxiliary equation for
one of the trinomial forms to which the quintic may be reduced
without any loss of generality, hence the simplicity of his result.
Cayley, employing an invariautive process, calculated the same equa-
t ion for the complete quintic,  that is, the quintic not deprived of any
of its terms, and not modified in any of its coefficients.     The result
is, of course, less simple tluin that for the trinomial form, but it has
the advantage of being absolutely complete.         Thus Cockle's labours
on the quintic invested the theory with a new interest, and the methods
he devised, and the results he obtained, largely directed the courso of
 subsequent speculation on the subject.
     His mode of dealing with the theory of differential equations was
equally marked by originality and independence of mind. Not con
fining himself to the beaten track, he pushed his way into unexplored
legions, and succeeded in bringing to light important relations and
analogies between algebraic and differential equations. Two ex-
amples may be given. He found that from any rational and entire
 algebraic equation of the degree n, whereof the coefficients are
 functions of a single parameter, we can derive a linear differential
 equation of the order n— 1, which is satisfied by any one of the roots
 of the algebraic equation.    Out of this germ has grown the theory of
Differential Resolvents.    To Cockle also belongs the honour of being
the first to discover and develop the properties of those functions
called Criticoids or Differential Invariants, so called because they
 remain unaltered when the differential equation is transformed by a
 change of one of the variables, and are therefore analogous in this
respect to the critical functions or seininvariants of common algebra.
 Criticoids seem destined to play an important part in the theory of
 hnear differential equations.
    Hut it would be impossible, within the limits at our disposal, to
 discuss in detail Cockle's various discoveries in algebra and the
 calculus. Enough to say here that his work was eminently initiatory.
 He started theories, but left others to elaborate and perfect them.
 Of his eighty or ninety papers given to the mathematical world,
 many are no doubt slight and fragmentary, but there are few, even
 .among the shortest and least complete, which do not contain original
 and valuable suggestions.      He struck out ideas which have taken
  root in other minds and borne fruit.

                                   XXXVI
    Thc loading events in his life are soon told. Ho was born on
 January 14, 1819, being the second son of the late Mr. James
  Cockle, of Great Oakley, Essex. From 1825 to 1829 he was educated
 at Stormond House, Kensington ; thence he was sent to Charter
 house, where he showed considerable power in making Latin verses.
 At the  end of his second year he was removed and placed under the
 tnition of the Rev. Christian Lenny, D.D., of St. John's College,
  Cambridge, who was the first to discover his mathematical talent.
 In  November, 1835, when he had nearly completed his seventeenth
 year, he went abroad, and was absent from England about twelve
  months, visiting the West Indies and the United States of America;
 at Cuba he acquired some knowledge of the Spanish language.
  Returning home he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, October,
  1837, and graduated as  thirty-third Wrangler in 1841.   His position
 in the Tripos gave no indication of his future eminence as a mathe
 matician, nor is the circumstance to be wondered at when we
 consider the character of his preparatory training, and the long
  break in his studies before he went up to the University. He pro
 ceeded to the degree of B.A. in 1842, and of M.A. in 1845.
    Mr. Cockle was entered as a student at the Middle Temple in 1838.
 He practised as a special pleader from 1845 to 1840, was called to
 the Bar at the Middle Temple in 1846, and joined the Midland
 Circuit at the Nottingham Spring Assizes in 1848. On August 22,
 1855, he married Adelaide Catherine, eldest surviving daughter of
 the late Mr. Henry Wilkin, formerly of Walton, Suffolk.       In 1862
 he drafted the "Jurisdiction in Homicides Act" (Imperial); and
 in the following year (1863) he was appointed by the English
 Oovernmcut first Chief Justice of Queensland.         Allusions have
 already been made to the fact that the position at the outset was
very trying, but the circumstances deserve more particular notice, as
 throwing light on the character of the man.   Mr. Justice Lutwyche,
who during the previous year or two had come into collision on
 several occasions with the Governor, and also with the Government
of the Colony, and whose claims to the supreme place on the bench
were in consequence passed over by the home authorities in favonr
 of the English barrister, naturally felt himself aggrieved at the
appointment of a younger man who had had no judicial experience.
The story, as told in the Brisbane papers on the death of the old
Judge in 1880, reflects equal credit on both men : " The late Judge
made no secret of his mortification at the appointment of Mr. Cockle.
A few years of association, however, entirely obliterated any feelings
of hostility to the Chief Justice that this event may have originally
engendered, and the two Judges became sincere and attached friends.
Sir James always paid a very marked deference to the opinion of his
learned brother, and the amiable disposition of the Chief Justice so

                                   xxxvn
wrought upon the sterner nature of his colleague that, when Sir
.Tamos left for Europe two years ago, the parting was a severe trial
to Mr. Lutwyche, who was extremely affected at bidding good-bye
to a friend whom he rightly divined he was never to see again."
    The Chief Justice was Senior Commissioner for the consolidation
 (effected in 1867) of the statute law of Queensland.          He was
 knighted by patent in 1869. In 1874 the Legislative Assembly of
 Queensland showed their appreciation of his services by passing an
 Act giving him a substantial increase of salary.
    Sir James Cockle's professional occupations at this period were
 numerous and exacting, yet he did not neglect his favourite science.
 He turned to mathematics as a relaxation, and devoted the intervals
 of official labour to researches in algebra and differential equations,
 embodying his results in papers which appeared from time to time
 in the ' Manchester Memoirs,' the ' Quarterly Journal of Mathe
 matics,' the ' Philosophical     Magazine,' and other periodicals in
                           '            '
 England, and in the Proceedings of the Royal Societies of New
 South Wales and Victoria, in Australia. He also wrote and pub
 lished a number of presidential addresses        delivered before the
 Queensland Philosophical Society (now incorporated into the Royal
 Society of Queensland) in which he dealt with questions in philo
 sophy, logic, and mathematics.
    In 1879 he resigned his position as Chief Justice of Queensland,
 having a few months before returned to England with his wife and
 children.     The remainder of his days was given to mathematical
 writing, the business of several learned bodies, and the society of
 his friends ; but he was never really strong after his return home,
 his health suffering perhaps from the change of climate.
    He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in
 1854, and served on its Council from 1888 to 1892. He was elected a
 Fellow of the Royal Society in 1865, a Corresponding Member of the
 Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, and a Member of the
 London Mathematical Society in 1870 ; he filled the Presidential
 Chair of the latter Society from 1886 to 1888. He was President of
 the Queensland Philosophical Society from 1863 to 1879, and was
 elected an Honorary Member of the Royal Society of New South
 Wales in 1876. He was a Commissioner for the Queensland Section
 of the Colonial and Indian Exhibition held in London in 1886 ; and
 was nominated to represent the Australian Colonies at the Washing
 ton Prime Meridian Conference in 1884, but was unable to accept the
 position.
    Of his personal and social qualities the writer may be permitted
 to speak from personal knowledge. He looks back with pleasure to
 an acquaintance begun nearly fifty years ago, which soon ripened
 into a friendship, never clouded even for a moment by the slighest

                                  XXXV1U
misunderstanding; drawn together by similar scientific tastes, the
two men had otherwise little in common. In their political and eccle
siastical opinions they differed fundamentally, and had it not been for
Cockle's imperturbable temper and graciously tolerant spirit, these
differences would often have disturbed their cordial relations.      Con
troversy, however, was distasteful to him, and he avoided the conflict
of argument. When it was suggested on one occasion that he should
offer himself for a seat in Parliament, he said playfully : " My addresi
to the electors shall run thus, — Gentlemen, I am in favour of making
                                            "
things agreeable all round — all round !       The snying revealed his
spirit.   He desired to live peaceably with all men, and so f.ir as we
know he had not a single enemy.         A man of somewhat phlegmatic
temperament, he was not easily excited. His features in repose were
calm and serious, and to strangers he usually gave the impression of
being very reserved ; but when conversing with his friends on con
genial subjects his countenance would light up witn a pleased expres
sion, and his manner become animated, while his fulness of knowledge
and ripe and varied experience       imparted to his observations an
interest of their own.    He was extremely cautious in offering a drli-
nite opinion on any debateable question, a habit probably due to his
legal training.   When not engaged in mathematical investigations,
his leisure   was  mostly devoted to problems in metaphysics and
theology, studies which had for him a special attractiveness, and in
both of which he was deeply versed.       His modesty was remarkable ;
rarely speaking of his own work, he was ever ready to recognise and
do full justice to the work of others.    There was in him none of the
petty jealousies  which  haunt   meaner  minds.   The writer remembers
with gratitude how, when he entered fields which Cockle might be
said to have made his own, he was r.ot treated as an intruder or a
rival, but welcomed as a friend and fellow- worker, and how he
received from his elder an amount of encouragement and help which
he can never sufficiently acknowledge.
   Cockle was an excellent correspondent, his caligraphy was clear
and good, and when writing on congenial themes he would often wax
truly eloquent. He had a positive enthusiasm for mathematics, and
the discovery of a new theorem or a new method always gave him
intense delight.    The writer has preserved most of the letters he
received from him, and placed them bound in several goodly volumes
among the choicest of his literary treasures.
    Something of a recluse, Sir James astonished many of his friends,
both in England and Australia, by the zest with which, during the
last ten or twelve years, he threw himself into the club life of the
Metropolis.     He became a member of the Garrick, the Savile, and
the Savage,   and an habitue of all three, being particularly attached to
the hist, of which he was Treasurer from 1881 to 1889. Queens

 lnnders visiting London could hardly look on gravely when they saw
how their old Chief Justice adapted himself to what one of them
called his " Bohemian and brilliant environment."          But even there
he was not unmindful of the claims of science.
                                                         " In the Savage
Club " writes one, " it was a familiar sight to see him quietly work-
ing at some algebraical research on the back of an envelope or some
odd scrap of paper, though always ready to break off and offer a
                                            He was a devoted " brother

genial welcome to one of his friends."
of the Masonic Order, and soon after his return home from Australia
he became a joining member of the Nine Muses Lodge, in which he
rose rapidly through various offices to the highest position, being
installed W.M. of that lodge on the 12th February, 1889.
    Sir James Cockle was a man of upright character and simple
tastes, of amiable disposition and courteous bearing, constant in his
friendships and faithful in all the relations of life ; being absolutely
devoid of ostentation, vanity, or pretence, his whole life was a
beautiful illustration of the motto on his crest — Esse quam videri.
He died at his residence in Bayswater on Sunday, the 27th January,
 1895, and was buried at Paddington          Cemetery on the following
Saturday.      He had nine children, of whom eight survive ; Lady
Cockle also survives him.
                                                                  R. H.
    William Pengelly, who died in       1894 at the ripe age of eighty-
two, was one of the last survivors of a scientific type represented by
Sedgwick, Lyell, Phillips, Murchison, and the other old heroes who
laid the foundation of geological science.     He belongs to the heroic
age of geology,     to that  group  of  men  who  found British geology
 almost a terra incognita, and left it so completely explored that there
is little left for their successors but to correct mistakes and fill in
minute details.
    Pengelly was born in 1812, at East Looe, in Cornwall, of a Quaker
stock, and lived all his life in the west country.         Like Professor
Dana, he took to the sea, and served before the mast.              Having,
 however, a decided taste     for mathematics and geology, he gave up
 seafaring and settled down as a teacher in Torquay.       Here, for some
sixty years, he threw himself into the work of higher education, and
more especially in the direction of natural science. In 1837, through
his energy, the Torquay Mechanics Institute, which had fallen on evil
days, was organised and put on a satisfactory working basis.         Seven
y  ears later he founded  the   Torquay  Natural History  Society,  and in
1863 he extended the range of his personal influence by establishing
the Devonshire Association, which took root and flourished exceed

 impossible to read any one of the many volumes published by the

Association without realising how great has been his influence in
bringing natural knowledge within reach of the people.                  The
museum at Torquay is also an enduring monument to his energy,
which will continue to teach when his name is forgotten.
     Pengelly was, however, beyond all other things, a geologist devoted
to the study of Devonshire.          The collection of Devonian fossils in
the Oxford Museum         is spoil  of  his hammer. He collected also the
                      " Monograph on the Lignite Formation of Bovey
materials for the
Tracey," a joint publication with Dr. Heer, that has thrown so much
light on the Miocene forests which clothed the slopes around the
Lake of Bovey. During the second quarter of the present century,
the question of the antiquity of man was steadily coming to the
front.    In 1847 Boucher de Perthes published his discovery of flint
implements along with the extinct mammalia in the river gravels of
Amiens and Abbeville.           Similar discoveries in Kent's Hole by Mr.
McEnery, made some time between 1825 and 1839, had been verified
by Godwin-Austen in 1840 and the Torquay Natural History Society
in 1846. So strong, however, were the prejudices against the anti
quity of man that the matter was not thought worthy of further
 investigation until the year 1858. Then it was determined that a
 new cave at Brixham, near Torquay, should be explored by a joint
 committee of the Royal and Geological Societies, consisting, among
 others, of Lyell, Falconer, Ramsay, Prestvvich, Owen, and Godwin-
 Austen, with Pengelly as the superintendent of the work. The result
 of the exploration established, beyond all doubt, the existence of the
 palroolithic man in the Pleistocene age, and caused the whole of the
 scientific world to awake to the fact of the vast antiquity of the
 human race.       From this time Pengelly's energies were mainly
  directed  towards   cave exploration.     In 1865 he undertook the super
  intendence of the exploration of Kent's Hole by a committee of the
  British Association. Day by day, except when the work was stopped,
  he visited the cave, and recorded on maps and plans the exact spot
  where each specimen was found, for no less than sixteen years.         The
  vast  collection of   palroolithic   implements  and fossil bones, each  of
  which bears traces of his handiwork, is represented in most of the
  museums in this country, and the annual reports, listened to with so
   much pleasure by crowds at the meetings of the British Association,
  are the inobt complete that have ever been published.           It may be
   objected that the accumulation of so much evidence of the existeDco
   of man in the Pleistocene age in the south of England was unneces
  sary.   It was, however, necessary to sweep away the mass of pre
  judice, and this could best be done by repeating the evidence.        Had
   this not been   clone   man   would    not occupy the recognised position
   which he now holds in the annals of geology. The rest of Pengelly's
'Aife was mainly given up to the researches in the other caves in

                                     xli
Devonshire.      In estimating his scientific work it must not     be for
gotten that     it was done in addition to the daily task of bread-
winning.
     There remains one other side of Pengelly's many-sided character
which deserves remark.         Ho was a fluent and genial speaker and
lecturer.     For many years he was a leading figure at the meetings of
the British Association, and there are but few large oentres where
he was not known as a lecturer and not welcomed as a friend. Some of
his jeux d' esprit, such as, for example, his saying in treating of the
 thorny question of man's antiquity, " That you may be as naughty as
you like," will long be remembered.       He died full of years, and with
 his services honourably recognised by his private friends and by the
 scientific world,

     By the death of Sih George Buchanan this country has lost one of
 its most prominent leaders in the branch of preventive medicine and
 public health. George Buchanan was the son of a medical prac
 titioner in Islington, in which parish he was born in 1831. Very
 early in life he gave evidences of marked ability, both in classical
 and mathematical pursuits, and after graduating B.A. at the London
 University, he entered University College Medical School, where he
 became a scholar and a medallist, and from which he took his M.B,
 and M.D. London, with honours and distinction.
     His early medical career fitted him eminently for the task of his
 maturer years.       He became Resident Medical Officer, and subse
 quently Physician, to the London Fever Hospital, where he acquired
 an intimate acquaintance with the various infectious fevers, and he
 joined the medical staff of the Hospital for Sick Children, where his
 clinical knowledge of disease became considerably enlarged. Thus,
 he was able to bring to bear upon the etiological research, to which
 he was soon to devote the best years of his life, a thorough practical
 and clinical knowledge of disease.      As far back as 1857, he became
  Medical Officer of Health to St. Giles. In many parts of London
  the duties of suoh a post were limited to the supervision of a few
  unimportant administrative details, but many of the annual and
  tlpecial reports issued by Dr. Buchanan during his tenure of office in St.
  Giles's remain to this day examples of the best type of administrative
  counsel based on knowledge, in a scientific sense, of the various con
  ditions which affect human health and life.         Indeed, it was the
  quality of these reports that led to his employment as a temporary
  medical inspector under Mr. (now Sir John) Simon, then Medical
  Officer to the Privy Council, who, in later days, in his work on
  '
    English Sanitary Institutions,' says of Buchanan, that he was " the
  author of reports which have become classical in sanitary literature,"

                                     xlii
   that he " had always shown himself of extraordinarily active and
   discriminating mind, and always intent on that exactitude which is
  essential to scientific accuracy."
      For some seven years Buchanan acted professedly as a temporary
   and occasional Inspector in the Medical Department of the Privy
  Council, but his services were such that he soon came to be continu
  ously engaged in the work of the Department, and in 1868 he
  received permanent appointment. In 1871 he was, with his chief and
  others, transferred to the newly formed Local Government Board.
      Daring his seven years of temporary duty Buchanan undertook a
  number of important enquiries. One, which stands out very promi
  nently, was a comprehensive investigation into the effects on health
  which had resulted from the large works of drainage and water
  supply carried out in a number of our towns and cities.         As this
  enquiry progressed, Buchanan came to see that the influence which
  had been exerted by these works was by no means limited to a
  reduction in the rate of mortality from those diseases which are com
  monly associated with the pollution of air, soil, and water, and he
  soon arrived at the conclusion that the drying of the soil brought
  about by works of deep drainage had been associated with a marked
 reduction in the mortality from phthisis. This point was worked out
 in much detail, and Buchanan was able to show that the diminution
 in the phthisis death-rate bore a distinct relation to the extent to
 which the level of subsoil water was lowered as the result of works
 of drainage; that the phthisis death-rate oscillatod in one and the
 same town with variations — of sufficient duration — in the oscillations
 of the subsoil water; and that .where, owing to physical or other
 circumstances, no lowering of the subsoil water had resulted frona
 works of drainage, there had been no material diminution in the
 amount of death from phthisis.
     This discovery has had an important influence on public health
 administration, and it has formed the basis of codes of bye-laws having
 for their object the exclusion of moisture and sub-soil emanations into
 the interior of dwelling-houses.    It also became the more interesting
 when it was ascertained, after the publication of Buchanan's reports,
 that Dr. Bowditch, of Massachusetts, had been making enquiries on
 somewhat the same lines, and had independently arrived at very
 similar conclusions.
     As has already been said, through his studies at the London Fever
 Hospital, Buchanan came to possess a highly scientific knowledge of
the various continued fevers ; and he was the writer of the article on
typhus fever in Reynolds' ' System of Medicine,' in addition to a
number of official reports having to do with the etiology of the specific
fevers. Perhaps one of the most important of the^e was one relating
to an outhreak of enteric fever at Citius College, Cambridge, in which

                                    xliii
it  was clearly proved that the specific poison of that disease could be
distributed in water pipes, as the result of an intermitting water-
service.
    In  1880 Buchanan was appointed to the post of principal medical
 officer to the Local Government Board, and during the twelve years
which followed he made it the aim of his administration that all
 advice rendered by his department should have a definitely scientific
 basis.   This principle he instilled into all his co-workers, and he was
 careful to employ the small annual grant made to the Medical
 Department for auxiliary scientific research to this end. In this way,
 research of the highest scientific value, as, for example, the investiga
 tions of Dr. Klein and Dr. Sidney Martin into the life-history of the
 specific organisms of disease, was undertaken side by side with thnt
 epidemiological field-work into the causes of epidemics, which forms
 so large a portion of the labours of the medical inspectors attached to
 the Public Hoalth Department of the State. In this way alone
 Buchanan rendered services of an eminent kind, not only to the State
 but to science, and his labours in this respect were deeply appreciated
 by co-workers in both hemispheres.
    In April, 1892, Dr. Buchanan retired from his official post, and on
 this occasion he received the honour of knighthood. But he had
 already undertaken to servo as a member of the Royal Commission
 on Tuberculosis, and to this and other self-imposed duties he now
 devoted himself.      On the death of Lord Basing he became chairman
 of  the  reconstituted Royal Commission, and the report which was
 only issued just before his death is known to have been largely com
 piled by him.
     During his official career Sir George Buchanan was in 1882
 admitted F.R.S. ; he became President of the Epidemiological
 Society ; he was elected to the Senate of the University of London ;
 and on his retirement he received the honorary LL.D. of Edinburgh,
 and became a censor of the Royal College of Physicians.        His death,
 which occurred suddenly during convalescence from a surgical
 operation, took place on the 5th of May, 1895.
                                                               R. T. T.
     General James     T. Walker, C.B., P.R.S., died    on the 16th of last
 February, having reached his seventieth year.       The son of a Madras
 civilian, who was for some time Judge at Cannanore, Walker was
 born in 1826, and, having passed at Addiscombe, he was appointed
 to the corps of Bombay Engineers in 1846.           He did good service
 during   several of  the wars in which   our armies have been engaged in
 India. At the siege of Multan he performed an act of gallantry,
 which, in later times, would probably have secured for him the
 Victoria Cross. He served at the battle of Guzerat, and in the sub

                                     XllV
sequent pursuit.     He was severely wounded at the siege of Delhi, and
was actively engaged in several of the wars with frontier tribes. Bat
his real life-work was connected with the surveys of India, and it is
on his services as a scientific geodesist of a very high order that his
title to fame must rest. His military reconnaissance and survey of
the Trans-Indus Region, during which he mapped upwards of 8,700
square miles of previously unexplored country, almost single handed,
between 1849 and 1853, though most important in itself, was mainly
a preparation for his work connected with the Great Trigonometrical
 Survey of India.
     Walker entered that department in 1853, and served in it for
 thirty years. This long time of most arduous service is divided into
 two distinct periods. For the first eight years he was under Sir
 Andrew Waugh, while for the remaining twenty-two years he was
 himself in charge, and latterly he undertook the control not only of
 the trigonometrical, but of all the other surveys of India. While
 under Sir Andrew Waugh, from 1853 to 1861, he was engaged on
 the northern section of the Indus series of triangles, and also on the
 measurement of the base near Attock, and afterwards on the Jogi
 Tila meridional series. When Sir Andrew retired, in 1861, Major
  Walker was marked out as his successor.        He had already received
  high praise for the character of his geodetic work, and his chief had
  thus addressed him : — " The brilliant suocess which invariably attends
  your undertakings is a proof of the high professional qualifications,
  the foresight, and judgment which you bring to bear on the im
  portant geodetioal work on which you are engaged."
      Walker assumed oharge of the survey at a time when much re
  vision had become desirable owing to improvements in the instru
  ments, and also at a time when it was within the range of reasonable
  hope that the great triangulation might be oompleted within the
  period of his own term of office. He first completed the last three
  meridional series in the north of India, and measured the Vizaga-
  patam base, and then turned his attention to a revision of Colonel
   Lambton's early triangulations in the Madras Presidency, and to a
  re-measurement of the Bangalore base. In 1873 he began to devote
   much attention to the dispersion of unavoidable minute errors in the
   triangulation, and it is an acknowledged fact that no trigonometrical
   survey in Europe equals that of India in accuracy. A great work
   was undertaken under Colonel Walker's auspices, with a view to pre
   serving a complete record of the various operations of the Great Trigo
   nometrical Survey, which is now contained in twenty volumes. The
   first nine were edited by Walker himself, the first appearing in
   1871, and he wrote the introductory history of the early operations
   of the survey, the accounts of the standards of measure and of the
    base lines, the descriptions of the methods of procedure and of the

                                  xlv
instruments,    and a history of the pendulum observations which he
inaugurated, two convertible pendulums having been lent to him by
the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg.
   While Colonel Walker conducted, to the very best advantage, the
most intricate and exact measurements, he also took a broad-minded
view of the rougher systems of exploration and reconnaissance.
Primarily he was a geodesist, but he was also an enthusiastic geo
grapher.     Snrvey parties were, in his time, carefully organised to
accompany every military expedition.          Native explorers were
trained as snrveyors, and despatched into unknown parts of Central
Asia and Tibet. Their work was reduced, critically examined, and
utilised on their return.     Numerous valuable general maps were
published at the office of the survey at Dehra Dun, and Walker's map
of Turkistan, which went through many editions, was the leading
authority for upwards of twenty years. Walker also established
friendly relations with the Russian surveying authorities, there was
an exchange of publications, India was well supplied with geo
graphical information from St. Petersburg, and there was a cordial
feeling of co-operation between the surveying officers of the two
countries.    During his short periods of leave in England, Colonel
Walker did not cease to work zealously for his department. On one
of these occasions he fixed the difference of longitude between
 London and Tehran ; on another he investigated the condition of
the plates of the Indian Atlas, and wrote an important memorandum
on the scale of the atlas and on the projection.    From 1878 Colonel
Walker undertook the onerous and difficult post of Surveyor-
General of India, in addition to his laborious and absorbing duties as
 Superintendent of the Great Trigonometrical     Survey. At last the
strain became too great. His health broke down, and although the
Viceroy was most anxious that he should remain, it became absolutely
necessary for him to leave India. He retired in 1883, and became a
General in 1884.
   In his retirement, General Walker continued to "live laborious
days.'.'  He conducted a large correspondence with geographers and
explorers, and with officers connected with geodetic surveys in various
 parts of the world, always being ready to furnish all the information
 and advice that his great experience could suggest.      He became a
Fellow of the Royal Society in 1865.        He was also a very active
member of the Council of the Royal Geographical Society for upwards
of ten years, and wrote several valuable papers on subjects relating to
the geography of Central Asia and Tibet. He had a happy knack of
communicating his knowledge to others unostentatiously, and in the
most effectual way. His kindness and patience in this respect were
much appreciated by the officers who served under him. While he
raised the standard of high excellence of the geodetic work in India,

 branch of the survey, at the same time he is remembered with
 affectionate regret, and his loss is deeply felt by the officers who had
 the honour of serving under him, as well as by a large circle of friends
 and acquaintances.

    Thomas   Henky Huxley was horn at about eight o'clock of the
morning of the 4th of May, 1825, at Ealing, then a quiet little
country village, now a part of the suburbs of London.          He was the
seventh child of George Huxley, himself a seventh child, and his
mother's maiden name was Rachel Withers.          In many instances, the
striking qualities  of a distinguished   man have   seemed to be derived
from the mother, aud Huxley has spoken of himself as completely
the son of his mother who was " a slender brunette, of emotional and
energetic temperament, excellent mental capacity and distinguishing
rapidity of thought."
   His father, of whom he could find in himself hardly a trace, was
second master at the school of Dr. Nicholson, in Ealing, then an
establishment of very high repute, at which Cardinal Newman, and
other distinguished men found part of their education, and to which
the young Thomas Heury was for a while sent ; but his stay there
was brief. Nor was he sent to any other school ; the greater part of
his education he got for himself, reading desultorily and fitfully, but
closely and to good purpose, whatever books came to his hand.
   From an early age he took a great interest in mechanical problems ;
and had he been able to follow his own wishes would probably have
adopted the profession of engineering.         But circumstances were
against this choice, and the fact of two brothers-in-law being doctors
seems to have, in part at least, determined his entering the medical
profession. He began his professional studies at an early age, under
the care of his brother-in-law, Dr. Salt, at that time practising in
London, to whom he became, according to the then practice, " an
apprentice."
   It was probably in the beginning of this apprenticeship, when he
was as yet only 13 or 14 years old, that he attended his first post
mortem examination; and to this his ardent curiosity led him to pay
such prolonged and close attention that he became in some way or
other poisoned, falling into so bad a state of health that he had to be
sent into the country, into Warwickshire, to recruit. Returning after
some months to London, restored in health, he resumed his duties as
apprentice to his brother-in-law, taking in so much of the learning of
the profession as the opportunities of his situation offered, and at the
same time storing and strengthening his mind with varied reading,
not only of science but also of literature.     Among other things he

                                   xlvii
acquired during this time a knowledge of French and of German.
There is no record of his having received any other than professional
tuition, and it must have been chiefly at least by his own efforts that
he acquired his large knowledge of other than professional subjects.
    In October, 1842, he and his elder brother, James, having obtained
free entrance Scholarships, entered Charing Cross Hospital. Here
he came under the influence of Thomas Wharton Jones, then the
lecturer at the Medical School there on Anatomy and Physiology,
whose physiological researches, especially those on the ovum and on
blood corpuscles, are of classic value. He threw himself with ardour
into anatomical and physiological studies, as is shown by his obtain
ing in the Honours division of the 1st M.B. examination at the
University of London, the second place (with a Medal), in Anatomy
and Physiology, the first place (with the exhibition) being taken by
W. H. Ransom, now the distinguished physician of Nottingham.
It is still more clearly shown by his having contributed, at Wharton
Jones' suggestion, to the ' Medical Gazette,' of November 28,
 1845, a small paper, in which he demonstrated the existence of a
hitherto unrecognized layer in the inner root sheath of hairs, since
known as Huxley's layer. And indeed his subsequent career proves
that he must have already possessed at the time of his leaving the
hospital an exceedingly large and exact knowledge of comparative
anatomy, and of the then existing anatomical methods.          Nor had he
neglected   the more   distinctly professional  studies, though his heart
was not in these ; for in the winter of 1845-6, having completed his
course, he was prepared to offer himself at the examination for the
membership of the Royal College of Surgeons, but being as yet under
twenty-one years of age could not be admitted as a candidate.
    Wondering at this time what he " should do to meet the impera
tive necessity for earning his own bread," he was urged by a fellow
student (the now Sir Joseph Fayrer) to offer himself for the medical
service of the Royal Navy. He accordingly wrote directly to Sir
William Burnett, then Director- General for the Medical Service
of the Navy, was accepted, and on the 13th March, 1846, was entered
as assistant surgeon on the books of Nelson's old ship, the " Victory,"
for duty at Haslar Hospital.      At about the same time he passed the
examination of the Royal College of Surgeons. At Haslar, where he
had for a messmate the late Sir Andrew Clark, he attracted the
notice of his chief, Sir John Richardson, the Arctic traveller, who
shewed his appreciation of the merits of the young navy surgeon by
keeping him at Haslar until an opportunity offered of placing him
in some post suitable to his obvious talents. Such a post was that of
                                               "
Assistant-Surgeon to H.M. surveying ship Rattlesnake," then about
 to start under the command of Captain Owen Stanley, brother of the
 late Dean Stanley, and son of the Bishop of Norwich, to survey
                                                                9 2

 Torres Strait, the Louisiade Archipelago, and the S.B. Coasts of
 New Guinea. Huxley, with joy accepted the offer and sailed from
 Plymouth, on December 12, 1846. Though he had been chosen by
 his chief by reason of his scientific promise, his position in the
 expedition was simply a professional one. The post of Naturalist to
 the expedition was filled by Mr. J. Macgillivray ; Huxley was merely
 the ship's surgeon.
    Calling on her way at Madeira, Rio Janeiro, the Cape, and Mau
 ritius, the " Rattlesnake " reached Sydney on July 15, 1847. Here,
 during a stay of nearly three months, while preparations were being
 made, the young naval surgeon, seeking relaxation from his profes
 sional work and his studies in the society of Sydney, became a general
favourite, and happily for himself met, loved, and gained the love of
the lady, then Miss Henrietta A. Heathorn, who was to be after
wards for so many years his devoted helpmate. On October 11 the
vessel started on its cruise, but reaching only as far as Port Curtis
and Cape Upstart, returned to Sydney in the following March.          In
April it started on its second cruise, reaching Cape York, landing
Kennedy's ill-fated expedition on its way at Rockingham Bay, going on
to Port Essington, and returning by the Timor Sea and Indian Ocean
to Sydney, which was reached in January of 1849.       In the following
May the vessel started on its third cruise to explore the Louisiade
Archipelago and the S.E. coast of New Guinea, returning to Sydney
in the following March, 1850.      Here the lamented death of Captain
Stanley led to their being ordered home.      Leaving Sydney on May 2,
returning by    the  South Pacific  and   Cape Horn, and calling at the
Falkland Islands and the Azores, the " Rattlesnake
                                                             " ' reached
England and was paid off at Chatham on November 9.                A full
narrative of the voyage was published by Mr. Macgillivray in 1852,
most of the illustrations being reproductions of drawings by
Huxley.
    The career of many a successful man has shown that obstacles
often prove the mother of endeavour, and never was this lesson,
clearer than in the case of Huxley. Working amid a host of diffi
culties, in want of room, in want of light, seeking to unravel the in
tricacies of minute structure with a microscope lashed to secure
steadiness, cramped within a tiny cabin, jostled by the tumult of a
crowded ship's life, with the scantiest supply of books of reference,
with no one at hand of whom he could take counsel on the problems
opening up before him, he gathered for himself during these four
years a large mass of accurate, important, and in most cases novel
observations, and illustrated them with skilful pertinent drawings.
Even his intellectual solitude had its good effects ; it drove him to
ponder over the new facts which came before him, and all his obser
vations were made alive with scientific thought.

     From time to time he sent home to the Linnean Society papers
"embodying the results of his researches.          One on Physalia was read
 in November and December,         1849, and another, on Diphyes was read

 briefest abstracts appeared in the ' Proceedings,' the author being
•erroneously     named William Huxley.           The f nil papers remained
 under consideration until September, 1851, 'when the MSS. of both
 were, at the author's request, returned to him. With the exception of
«, small note on tho blood of Amphibxus              which appeared in the
 ' British Association              '
                           Reports for 1847, and which recorded observa
 tions made in the previous autumn while he was still at Haslar, the
 only papers of his which were published before his return to England
 in November, 1850, were, in the first place, the memoir " On the
 Anatomy and Affinities of the Family of the Medusae," which had
 been communicated to the Royal Society by tho Bishop of Norwich
  (to whom, at Captain Stanley's suggestion, he had sent the MS.),
And published in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' for 1849, and, in
  the second place, shorter communications on Trigonia, on Firola and
 Atlantis, and on Mednsie, which appeared in the ' Proceedings of
 the Zoological Society,' the 'Annales des Sciences Naturelles,' and
 tho 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History,' during the year
  1850.
     The  " Rattlesuake " having       been paid off, Huxley applied to the
 Admiralty     to   be  "borne  on    the  books" of H.M.S. " Fisgard " at
  Woolwich, that is to say, to be appointed Assistant-Surgeon to the
  ship
        " for particular service," so that he " should not be
                                                                  obliged to
  remain on board, but might live in town and work up " the observa
 tions made during the voyage " into a well-digested and consistent
 whole." In a letter to Sir W. Burnett, who remained his staunch
 friend, he described the investigations which he thus desired to
 elaborate as being chiefly those on the anatomy of certain Gasteropod
 and Pteropod Mollusca, of Firola and Atlantis, of Salpa and Pyro-
  soma, of two new Ascidians, namely, Appendicularia and Doliolnm, of
  Sagitta and certain Annelids, of the auditory and circulatory organs
  in certain transparent Crustacea, and of the Medusa) and Polypes ; of
  the latter he had carefully examined and figured species of between
 40 and 50 genera.
     The request was granted.            For the next three years Huxley,
 nominally    a navy surgeon,   lived    in London with his brother, George
  Huxley, devoting his time to the purpose just mentioned; and during
 the years 1851-3 he published the results of his labours in numerous
  papers, the most important of which are the memoirs on Salpa and
  Pyrosoma, on Appendicularia and Doliolum, and on the morphology
  of the Cephalous Mollusca, which appeared in the ' Philosophical
                  '
   Transactions     for 1851 and 1853.

                                     1
   One effect of the publication of these researches was to bring their
author, almost at a single bound, into the first rank of English
anatomists. Within eight months of his return, namely, on June 5,
1851, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in the follow
ing year he received a Royal Medal of the Society " for his papers on
the anatomy and affinities of the Medusae," the other Royal Medal of
the same year being given to Joule, the Rumford Medal to Stokes,
and the Copley Medal to Humboldt.
   In judging of the value to be allotted to these early papers by
Huxley, the condition of comparative anatomy at that time in Eng
land must be had in mind. There were several zealous and active
(systematic zoologists, but in comparative anatomy itself, in the
science of animal morphology, the only notable labourers were
Richard Owen and John Goodsir. The latter, moreover, was work
ing on so special a line, and in so special a manner, that the former
may be said to have been almost standing alone.       And his work con
sisted, on the one hand, of detailed descriptions, possessing the highest
merit and greatest value, of the structure of an immense number of
animal forms, and, on the other hand, of generalisations and specula
tions of a metaphysical kind, based largely on the philosophy of Oken,
and, as time has since proved, of a fruitless, barren nature. The more
sober method of determining the true homologies of animal structures,
and the true affinities of animal forms, of which the criteria had been
furnished by the labours of von Baer, and which was being fruitfully
worked in Germany by Johannes Miiller, the method which led the
anatomist to face his problems in the same spirit in which the
physicist faced his, was almost unknown, or at least unused, in Eng
land. It was, it is true, appreciated by Carpenter, but he at that
time was much more of an expositor than an investigator.           Of the
value of this method, to the knowledge of which he must have been
led by his solitary readings in his old Charing Cross days, Huxley's
early papers came as a startling and convincing proof, and in the
words with which the then President of the Royal Society, the Earl
of Rosse, accompanied the presentation of the Royal Medal, it is not
difficult. reading between the lines, to recognise the appreciation of
a new spirit of anatomical inquiry, not wholly free from a timorous
apprehension as to its complete validity. " In those papers you have
for the first time fully developed their (the Medusae) structure, and
laid the foundation of a rational theory for their classification."
"In your second paper, 'On the Anatomy of Salpa and Pyrosoma,'
the phenomena, &c., have received the most ingenious and elaborate
elucidation, and have given rise to a process of reasoning, the results
of which can scarcely yet be anticipated, but must bear in a very im
portant degree upon some of the most abstruse points of what may be
called transcendental physiology."

   Nor was it only in impersonal academic distinctions that Huxley
found his worth recognised. In the scientific world of London he
soon formed warm friendships, both among the older and the younger
generations. By Edward Forbes, in whose nature there was much
that was kin to his own, and with whom he had had some acquaint
ance before his voyage, he was at once greeted as a comrade, and
with Joseph Dalton Hooker, to whom he was drawn at the very first
by their common experience as navy surgeons, he began an attach
ment which, strengthened by like biological aspirations, grew closer
as their lives went on. In the first year of his return, in the autumn of
1851, he made the aquaintance of John Tyndall at the meeting of the
British Association at Ipswich ; and the three, Hooker, Huxley, and
Tyndall, finding how much in common were all their scientific views
and desires, formed then and there a triple scientific alliance. Nor were
older and more influential friends wanting ; and these made repeated
efforts to induce the Admiralty to at least contribute to the expense of
publishing Huxley's researches.         But in vain ; and after three years
the young naval surgeon, whose scientific abilities were thus giving
trouble, was ordered to join a ship for active service. This he declined
to do, and, though absolutely without private resources, boldly threw
himself into a scientific life.    For a year or so he appears to have
maintained himself by his pen, fighting with it a double fight, labour
ing on the one hand to make the results of his inquiries known to the
scientific world, and struggling on the other to secure his daily bread.
A candidature abont this time for the Chair of Natural History in the
University of Toronto proved unsuccessful, as did also a like candi
dature for the Chair of Physics, in the same University, by his now
close friend John Tyndall.       But in 1854 his chance came. Edward
Forbes, who held the posts of Palaeontologist to the Geological
Survey, and Lecturer on General Natural History at the Metropolitan
School of Science applied to Mining and the Arts, subsequently called
the Royal School of Mines, had just left these to fill the Chair of
Natural History at Edinburgh, and Sir H. De la Beche, the then
Director- General of the Geological Survey, offered both the posts to
Huxley, who in June and July of that year had given lectures at the
school in place of Forbes.         Of this he has said himself,* " The
former post (that of Palaeontologist)           I  refused point blank, and
accepted the latter (that of Lecturer) only provisionally,            telling
Sir Henry that     I   did not care for fossils, and that I should give
up   Natural   History   as soon as    I  could get a physiological post."
As he himself has said, "there was very little of the genuine
                     I
naturalist in me ; never collected anything, and species work was a
burden to me. What        I cared for was the architectural and engineer
ing part of the business; the working out the wonderful unity of
                            * '
                                Autobiography,'  p. 15.

                                    lii
plan in the thousands and thousands of diverse living constructions,
and the modifications of similar apparatus to serve diverse ends."
And there can be little doubt but that had a suitable opening offered
itself, he would have thrown himself into a distinctly physiological
career, and the advancetnent of morphology, due to him, would have
been limited to the
                      " Rattlesuake " work. But this was not to be.
Though his leanings towards physiology pure and simple broke ont at
times, as in various lectures and addresses, and in the publication of
the little work on " Elementary Physiology," and were shown all his
life long in the helping hand and warm sympathy which he always
gave to all physiological inquiries, and to all physiological workers,
his work in life was destined to be mainly limited to morphology,
and conspicuously to the elucidation of the fossils " for which he did
not care."
   The emoluments of the post of Lecturer on Natural History at the
School were but scanty ; but they gave Huxley a pied a terre, and,
moreover, the sagacious De la Beche, foreseeing, it would seem,
Huxley's future relations to fossils more clearly than he did himself,
since he had refused the post of Palaeontologist to the Survey, found
for him in April of the following year, 1855, a special place as
Naturalist to the Survey, by which a more suitable income was pro
vided for him while an internal arrangement distinguished his duties
towards the fossils in the Geological Museum from those of the proper
Palaeontologist to the Survey, Mr. Salter.      Thus, though he had (to
the great benefit of palaeontology) official relations to the fossils of the
Survey, relations which were more precisely defined a little later on —
in 1861, by De la Beche's successor, Sir Roderick Murchison — Huxley
was never technically Palaeontologist to the Survey.
   For science and the world at large the important thing is that by
the appointment Huxley's career was assured. And the income which
by this settled appointment and by other efforts he was able to secure,
justified him, he thought, in offering a home to the lady whom he had
first met in 1847, whom he had since seen fitfully in the Rattle
suake's visits to Sydney, and whom he had left in that city, in 1850.
 She at once came to England, and on July 21, 1855, they were
married.
   For many years afterwards Huxley's life, so far as outward things
are concerned, was the ordinary life of a professional man of science
in London. He did his duty as Lecturer at the School, and as
Naturalist to the Survey, and those who listened to his lectures, and
were capable of appreciating them, were witness to the zeal and
energy with which he threw himself into the exposition of the new
morphology.     He as zealously carried out the other scientific duties
 which came in his way, whether accompanied by emolument or no.
Very shortly after his appearance in London, on April 30, 1852, he

                                      liii
gave his first Friday evening lecture at the Royal Institution, on
 " Animal Individuality." It is encouraging to others to know that
the superb lucidity and constrained biting eloquence which later on
 marked his public speaking were not present from the first. Though
 he was always helped by his striking skill as a draughtsman, his expo
 sitions of his themes seemed at first halting and imperfect. He had,
 like others, to learn that a public audience do not grasp with avidity a
 truth presented to them, irrespective of the manner in which it is laid
 before them.      He talked at first " above the heads of his hearers,"
 thinking that they could see things as clearly and as eagerly as he
-did himself.    Indeed there is a tale told that after a lecture in a
 suburban athenaeum, " On the Relation of Animals to Plants," in
 which he had discussed before his common-place audience some of
 the most fundamental biological problems, there was a general
 expression of the desire that the committee would never invite that
joung man to lecture again.
     He held dnring the years 1856-57-58, the 'post of Fullerian Pro
 fessor of Physiology in the Royal Institution, choosing for the title
-of the first two courses Physiology and Comparative Anatomy, for his
 face was as yet turned towards physiology.        The third course, how
 ever, was   " On the Principles of Biology."
     Then, like most other young professional men of science, he
 had to eke out his not too ample income by labours undertaken
-chiefly for their pecuniary reward.       He acted as examiner, conduct
 ing, for instance, during the years 1856-1863, and again 1865-1870,
 the examinations in Physiology and Comparative Anatomy at the
 University of London, making even an examination paper feel the
 influence of the new spirit in biology ; and among his examinees at
 that time there was at least one who, knowing Huxley's writings,
 but his writings only, looked forward to the viva voce test, not as a
 trial, but as an occasion of delight. And he wrote almost incessantly
 for all editors who were prepared to give adequate pay to a pen able
to deal with scientific themes in a manner at once exact and popular,
 incisive and correct.
    And when he had done all this, to say nothing of the unpaid
 demands for the administration of science made on him as on all men
.of science, he had yet to do what was his main work, the prosecution
 of his inquiries.   For the first few years he devoted himself mainly
 towards completing his " Rattlesuake " work.        He followed up the
                 "
 paper on the Medusae," mentioned above, by various communica
tions on the same theme, published in various channels, and embodied
 his results in the monograph " On the Oceanic Hydrozoa," the publi
cation of which, delayed by the hope of obtaining assistance from
my Lords of the Admiralty, did not take place until 1858. In 1853
                                                         '
 there appeared in the ' Philosophical Transactions        his remarkable

                                     liv
memoir " On the Morphology of the Cephalons Mollusca," in which he
investigated the structure of these animals according to the same
canons which had guided him in respect to the Medusae.               Other
papers, such as those on   Doliolum,    Sagitta, and Tethyia, were also the
outcome of his labours at sea, but part of the programme which he
sketched out in his letter to Sir W. Burnett remained for a long time
unGnished, and part was never completed at all.
    For new lines of inquiry were continually opening up to him. In
the first place he was occupying himself with morphological prob
lems presented by invertebrate forms other than those which came
before him on the ocean, as shown by his paper on Aphis, pub
                                           '
lished in the ' Linnean Transactions         in 1858, and by others ; and
with still greater energy did he throw himself into vertebrate morph
 ology, preparing himself for the task by a careful study of vertebrate
embryology, a subject then, in spite of the lead given by Allen
Thomson, much neglected in England, though most successfully
cultivated in Germany by Kolliker and others. One of the fruits of
these labours was the Croonian Lecture, " On the Theory of the
Vertebrate Skull," delivered November, 1858, in which, following up
 Rathke, he strove to substitute for the then dominant fantastic doc
trines of the homologies of the cranial elements advocated by Owen,
 sounder views based on embryological evidence.             He exposed the
futility of attempting to regard the skull as a series of segments, in
each of which might be recognised all the several parts of a vertebra,
and pointed out the errors of trusting to superficial resemblances of
shape and position.      He showed, by the history of the develop
ment of each, that, though both skull and vertebral column are seg
mented, the one and the other, after an early stage, are fashioned on
lines so different as to exclude all possibility of regarding the
detailed features of each as mere modifications of a type repeated
along the axis of the body.
                                " The spinal column and the skull start
from the same primitive condition, whence they immediately begin
                 " It may be true to say that there is a
to diverge."                                                      primitive
identity  of structure between   the   spinal  or vertebral column  and the
skull ; but it is no more true that the adult skull is a modified verte
bral column than it would be to affirm that the vertebrate column is a
modified skull." This lecture marked an epoch in England in verte
brate morphology, and the views enunciated in it, carried forward, if
somewhat modified, as they have been, not only by Huxley's subse
quent researches and by those of his disciples, but especially by the
splendid work of Gegenbaur, are still, in the main, the views of the
anatomists of to-day.
    In the second place, led probably by the desire, which only gradu
ally and through lack of fulfilment left him, to become a physiologist
i-i-h^r than a naturalist, he turned to histological themes, as shown.

                                      lv
by his papers on the Teeth, the Corpuscula Tactus, and other topics
 in the 'Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science' for 1853-54,
 and more especially by his elaborate paper on the " Tegumentary
          "    '
 Organs in Todd's Cyclopaedia.'         In a striking " Review of the Cell
 Theory," which appeared in the ' British and Foreign Medical
          '
Review      in 1858, a paper which more than one young physiologist
at the time read with delight, and which even to-day may be studied
with no little profit, he, in this subject as in others, drove the sword
of rational inquiry through the heart of conceptions, metaphysical
and transcendental, but dominant.
    In the third place, the fossils, " for which he did not care," began,
owing to his official position, to thrust themselves upon his notice.
He found that they, after all, no less than living things, presented
morphological problems ; indeed, he soon began to see that in many
cases they furnished not so much the problem as the key to the
problem, sought for in vain among living forms.          It was by a sort
of irony of fate that the study of the despised fossils, working
into the study of recent forms, led him to some of the conclusions
by which he has most advanced the natural knowledge of the laws
of life.
   Nor was it long before the fossils began to exert their power. So
early as 1855 he published, in conjunction with Salter, the official
Palaeontologist to the Snrvey, a paper
                                                 " On the Affinities of a
Crustacean from the Ludlow Rocks, Himantopterus
                                                         "
                                                           (now Slimonia),
which was followed up four years afterwards, 1859, by a large
memoir, ' On the Anatomy and Affinities of the Genus Pterygotus,'
still regarded as the classic work on the subject.            In the same
year, 1855, he published a paper,
                                       " On the Structure of the Shields
of Pteraspis," and three years later, in 1858, one on " Cepha-
laspis," thus clearly establishing for the first time the vertebrate
nature of these remains. This was his introduction at once to fossil
fishes, to which he was hereafter to pay much attention, and, through
palaeontology, to geology.    He joined the Geological Society in 1856
(having in the same year become a member of the Zoological Society ;
the Linnean he did not join until 1858), and in 1859 became one of
the secretaries.   His work on the ' Devonian Fishes ' he embodied in
a memoir of the Geological Survey, published in 1861, which, though
entitled a Preliminary Essay, threw an entirely new light on the affini
ties of these creatures, and, with the continuation published later, in
1866, still remains a standard work.
   The decennium of the fifties may be taken as forming one stage in
Huxley's career, for at the end of that period was published that
                     '
'
  Origin of Species (the paper at the Linnean Society, by Darwin
and Wallace, was read on July 1, 1858, and the book appeared
on November 24, 1859), which had so great an influence not only on

                                   Ivi
his own scientific development, but also, and much more so, on his
outward scientific activity.
   He first met Mr. Darwin soon after his return from Australia, in
1851 or 1852, and the acquaintance rapidly ripened into a close friend
ship. Next to Lyell and Hooker, it was Huxley on whom Darwin leant
for advice and help ; he came to speak of him playfully as " my general,
agent," and Huxley was one of the few who were privileged to learn
Darwin's argument before it was put forth to the world.
   From the very first Huxley had felt it as a duty laid upon him to
expound by mouth and by pen the teachings of science in general,
and of biological science in particular, to that large part of the world
which lay outside science, knowing little of it and caring less for it ;
for there came to him very early the conviction that science was not
merely the study of the few, for the sake of the intellectual gratifica
tion of the pursuit or the material benefits of the applications, but a
thing to be known and, so far as may be, understood of all men as a
sure guide for human life.    It was this conviction which led him to
devote much time and care to more or less popular lectures and
addresses, inculcating the broad uses and value of science, such as the
the Friday Evening Discourse (at the Royal Institution, which he gave
in 1856) on " Natural History as Knowledge, Discipline, and Power."
And he at once saw the far-reaching value of the lesson in evolu
tion so forcibly expounded in the ' Origin of Species by Natural
Selection.' Beginning with the striking review in the ' Times.'
which appeared the day after the publication of the book, continuing
with the Friday Evening Discourse, in 1860, on " Species, Races, and
their Origin," following up in the same year with lectures to work
ing men at Jermyn Street, on " The Relation of Man to the Lower
Animals," and later on with the book on ' Man's Place in Nature,'
and by many other utterances, he became known far outside the
narrow circle of scientific workers as the powerful champion of what
soon came to be called the Darwinian doctrine.      One event especially
brought his name before the public, and that was the memorable
meeting of the British Association at Oxford in June, 1860, at which
 Samuel Wilberforce, the then Bishop of Oxford, in a discussion on
the burning topic, wholly unaware of the new forces which had
arisen in biologic science, and thinking to crush the new doctrine
with one episcopal blow, was, by his ignorance, delivered into Huxley's
hands and smitten by him hip and thigh.         Before that the name of
Huxley was but little known outside scientific circles and that section
of London society which delights to entertain " eminent science ;"
 after that it became, and rapidly, to be quoted among the people as
 the name of a leader of men in science.
    All this labour of exposition, and the various calls made upon him
 \r  his increasing fame as a man of science of unwonted brilliancy and

                                     Ivii
power, consumed much of his time ; but he was now in the prime of
his intellectual energy ; financial cares, moreover, though still present,
were gradually lessening ; and during the next decennium he found
opportunity to do some of the best of his purely scientific work.
   Yet once more the fossils " were upon him," and indeed this
decennium of his life was to a considerable extent a geological one.
In 1862, at the close of his term of office as Secretary to the Geolo
gical Society, he was called upon, in the absence of the President,
Mr. Leonard Horner, to deliver the Presidential Address, and in this
he shattered an accepted doctrine of the geologists of the day, that a
similar succession of organic remains in two distinct regions denoted
synchronism of formation in the strata containing them. He intro
                                "
duced the word " homotaxis        to denote what alone was really shown
by the facts, namely, that in each region the forms of life had fol
lowed each other in the same general order. It is worthy of note that
in thy same address, though at the time in the very flush of advocacy
                                                       '                  *
before the people of the doctrines laid down in the Origin of Species
as a reasonable hypothesis of a mode of evolution, he showed his
anxiety that his scientific brethren should distinguish between a
hypothesis for which there was much to be said, and a clear positive
demonstration by the evidence of facts.        Knowing his audience, he
did not once allude to Darwin ; he did not even think it necessary to
speak of the imperfection of the geological record ; aware that the
younger geologists were likely to be carried beyond the evidence by
the fascination of the general idea, he used his critical power to show
that so far as the then knowledge went there was no case clearly
made out by any fossil remains of any one form being progressively
modified into others.     But his attitude in this was an attitude of
judicial caution only. In the address which, as President of the
same Society, he had to give in 1868, dwelling on the catastrophic
and uniformitarian schools of geological thought, he showed in a
most powerful mi nner how the doctrine of evolution, taking in all
that was good of e ach of the other schools, was destined to be the
guide of geologists in the future.         Further, in the Presidential
Address which again      he   had  to  give in 1872, he pointed out how
much even ten years had added to palaeontological knowledge; so
that now at least it mi^ht be said, in the case of the higher verte
brates, evolution had been proved as a historical fact. Since that
date evidence has rolled in fast, and in his latest utterances, in the
year before his death, he was able to p ,int to the plain teaching of
palaeontological records as affording clear and absolute proof of evolu
tion having taken place, a proof the validity of which could never be
shaken by the fate which might in the future await the reasonable
hypothesis of Mr. Darwin as to how evolution had taken place.
   Though he was at this time prominent among geologists, and they

                                      Iviii
again and again profited by his advice and advocacy, as when, in
 1862, he defended their claims for time against the attack of the
physicists, his heart was not with them. Fossils to him were of little
value as geological tokens compared with what they were worth as
starting points for morphological inquiries.     Just as he had used the
Devonian fishes as guides for the investigation of piscine morphology,
(which led him to the recognition of the peculiar structure of the
crossopterygian fin), and, later on, to the distinction of the two
types (hyostylic and autostylic) of piscine jaw-suspension, as well as
to a comparison of the paired fin of the fish with the pentadactyle limb,
so the fossil reptiles of the Elgin sandstones with dinosaurian and
labyrinthodontian remains, as well as other amphibian, reptilian, and
avian specimens, led him to far-reaching researches into reptilian
and avian morphology.         Into these researches — for the aspirations
towards a physiological career had by force of circumstance by this
time quite died away — he threw himself with characteristic ardour.
 Starting with the first papers on " Plesiosaurus Etheridgii, from
Glastonbury," in 1858, on " Stagonolepis Robertsonii, from the Elgin
sandstones," and " On some Amphibian and Reptilian Remains, from
                                 "
South Africa and Australia          in 1859, he was occupied during the
whole of this decennium and the earlier part of the succeeding one in
putting forth numerous papers dealing with the questions arising out
of the fossils, which fate, in opposition to his early wishes, had thus
thrust upon him. One great consequence of these researches was
that science was enriched by a clear demonstration of the many and
close affinities between reptiles and birds, so that the two hencefor
ward came to be known under the joint title of Sauropsida, the
amphibia being at the same time more distinctly separated from the
reptiles, and their relations to fishes more clearly signified by the
joint title of Ichthyopsida.       At the same time proof was brought
forward that the line of descent of the Sauropsida clearly diverged
from that cf the Mammalia, both starting from some common
ancestry. And besides this great generalisation, the importance of
which, both from a classificatory and from an evolutional point of
view, needs no comment, there came out of the same researches
numerous lesser contributions to the advancement of morphological
knowledge, including among others an attempt, in many respects
successful, at a classification of birds.
   In the same decenninm Huxley's scientific activity carried him
into yet another field of inquiry. One interest of the doctrine of
Natnral Selection lay in its bearings towards the problem of the
relation of Man to the lower animals; it offered a new guide for the
study of the Natural History of Man ; it awakened a new interest,
which Huxley did not neglect to foster, in ethnological and anthro
pological inquiries.   In all his utterances on the general bearings of

                                    lis
                                            '
Mr. Darwin's work, as, for instance, in       Man's Place in Nature,' he
strove   to make  it  clear that the  same  measure   must be meted to
man as to any other living organism ; man was to be studied by the
same methods as were animals.         His published ethnological papers,
beginning with a     " Letter on the Human Remains found in Shell
Mounds," in the Ethnol. Soc. Trans.' for 1863, are not numerous,
                   '
nor can they be taken as a measure of his influence on this branch of
study. In many ways he made himself felt, not the least by the
severity with which, on the one hand, he repressed the pretensions of
shallow persons who, taking advantage of the glamour of the
Darwinian doctrine, talked nonsense in the name of anthropological
science, and, on the other hand, exposed those who, in the structure
of the brain or of other parts, saw an impassable gulf between man
and the monkey. The episode of the " hippocampus
                                                           "
                                                             stirred for a
while not only science but the general public. He used his influence,
already year by year growing more and more powerful, to keep the
study of the natural history of man within its proper lines, and chiefly
with this end in view held the Presidential Chair of the Ethnological
Society in 1869-70. It was mainly through his influence that this
older Ethnological Society was, a year later, in 1871, amalgamated
with a newer rival society, the Anthropological, under the title of
" The
        Anthropological Institute." He had previously, in 1866-67,
taken ethnology as the subject of the lectures which during two
years he gave, holding for the second time the post of Fullerian
Professor at the Royal Institution.
   The year 1870 may be taken as marking a turning point in Hux
ley's career.   Up to that time, though having more public demands
made upon him than upon most men of science of the same age and
standing — though engaged in regular lectures, both at the School of
Mines and at the Royal College of Surgeons, at which, in succession
to Owen, he was Hunterian Professor from 1863 to 1870, he was able
to devote the greater part of his days to scientific inquiry.         But
about this time the change came. Though after this he did valuable
scientific work, his time became more and more taken up by the
accomplishment of duties thrust upon or taken up by him, some
scientific, others not, and the hours which he could devote to quiet
inquiry became fewer and yet more few.
   In 1870 he filled the Presidential Chair of the British Association
at the meeting at Liverpool, having been President of the Section D
(Biology) at Cambridge in 1862, and again at Nottingham in 1866.
   In October, 1872, part of, and later on the rest of, the Metropolitan
School of Science (which in 1863 had become the Royal School of
Mines), hitherto established in Jermyn Street, in conjunction with the
Museum of Geology belonging to the Geological Survey, was moved
to new buildings at South Kensington.         The reorganisation and the

                                      lx
 subsequent development of the school at South Kensington made
 Huxley's hands very full. In particular, he spent much time and
 energy in so organising a course of lectures which he was called
 upon to give to selected teachers of the classes examined by the
  Science and Art Department (he had for many years been examiner
 in zoology and physiology for the Department) as to make it a model
 of instruction in the general principles of biology.   In that course he
 selected certain topics relating to the structure and life history of
 both plants and animals which he judged most fundamental and
 illustrative.  He gave early in the forenoon an expository lecture,
 illustrated by a few diagrams, but chiefly his own admirable black
 board sketches ; the rest of the day his four demonstrators, W.
 Thiselton Dyer, Michael Foster, E. Ray Lankester, and William
 Rutherford, did their best to make each member of the class see for
 himself or herself, so far as was possible, the actual thing of which
 the master had spoken.      Each lecture, it need hardly be said, was a
 model of clear, incisive, suggestive exposition ; the young demon
 strators, who had as yet their spurs to win, did their best to make
 their work worthy of their chief ; and whether they succeeded in
 teaching much or little, at least learnt much. This course of lectures,
 subsequently repeated with various modifications, became a pattern
 for biological instruction in England ; it is not too much to say that it
 brought about a revolution in the teaching of biology in this country.
     In 1871 the post of Secretary to the Royal Society became vacant,
 through the resignation of William Sharpey, and the Fellows learnt
 with glad surprise that Huxley, whom they looked to rather as a not
 distant President, was willing to undertake the duties of the office.
 For the ten years 1871-80 no small portion of his time and thought
were (under first his old friend Hooker, and then Spottiswoode, as
 President) devoted to the interests of the Society ; for he had formed
 a very high ideal of the duties of the Society as the head of science
in this country, and was determined that it should not at least fall
short through any lack of exertion on his part.
     As was said above, one guiding principle in Huxley's life was the
deep conviction that science was meant not for men of science alone,
but for all the world : and that not in respect to its material benefits
only, but also, and even more, for its intellectual good.      It was for
this reason chiefly that in 1870, on the new educational departure
then made, he consented to become a candidate for the London School
Board, and, being elected, made himself felt in that assembly as he
did in others, bringing to bear on its deliberations all the influence of
a man, not only acute and learned, but wise and just.
    In spite of the great amount of work which, ever since he landed
from the " Rattlesnake," he had daily got through, in the midst of all
the distractions of London life, he was never really a robust man ;

                                            Ixi
though he had no serious illness, he from time to time, from his youth
upward, suffered from digestive troubles, and again and again
abnormal products of the corporeal laboratory, running riot in his
blood, gave rise to feelings of gloomy depression and lassitude,
unfitting him for intellectual work. All this, however, he could hide
from the world ; but he could not hide the more serious failure of his
health which the intellectual strain of so many duties of such different
kinds now brought upon him, and in 1872 he was induced to take a
long holiday in a visit to Egypt. He returned much refreshed, and,
though his intimate friends confessed to themselves that, in point of
bodily vigour, he was not the man he had been, the outside world saw
but little evidence of this. In 1872 he had been elected Lord Rector
of Aberdeen University, and in February, 1874, he delivered, upon
his installation, his inaugural address.            In the summers of 1875-70,
he delivered at the University of Edinburgh the courses of lectures
on Natural History, in the place of Wyville Thomson, who was absent
                         "
on the " Challenger         expedition. In 1876 he paid a visit to America,
delivering an address on
                                  " University Education," at Baltimore, ou
the occasion of the formal opening of the Johns Hopkins University,
and giving three lectures on Evolution, at New York. His stay in
the States had somewhat of the nature of a royal progress, for what
ever city or town he visited, unless he managed to slip in unknown,
something in the public way, an address or a reception, was expected
of him.
    In spite of all the professional and public demands made upon
him — and to those already mentioned may be added those of Trustee
of the British Museum, to which office he was elected in 1887,
and the serving on Royal or other Commissions* — in spite of his now
acknowledged fame as one who united profound scientific know
ledge with an incisive power of speech sparkling with wit, such as
few men of any kind of career possessed, leading his presence to be
sought wherever it could be gained, and it was freely given whenever
the advance of natural knowledge and the progress of sound thought
seemed to him to call for it, he still found some hours left for his
anatomical investigations.          His most important contributions during
   *  These  were — (1) Royal Commission on the Operation of Acts relating to
Trawling for Herrings on the Coast of Scotland, 1802.        (2) Royal Commission to
enquire into the Sea Fisheries of the United Kingdom, 1864-65.         (3) Commission
on the Royal College of Science for Ireland, 1866.         (4) Commission on Science
and Art Instruction in Ireland, 1868.        (5) Royal  Commission  upon the Adminis
tration and Operation of the Contagious Diseases Acts, 1870-71.       (6) Royal Com
mission   on Scientific  Instruction and the Advancement of Science, 1870-75.
(7)  Royal  Commission  on  the Practice of subjecting Live Animals to Experiments
for Scientific Purposes, 1876.       (8) Royal Commission        to enquire into the
Universities of Scotland, 1870-78.      (9)   Royal Commission   on the Medical Acts,
1881-82.    (10) Royal  Commis-ion    on Trawl,   Net, and Beam  Trawl Fishing, 1884.

this decenninm were in part continuations of his former labours, snch
as the paper and subsequent full memoir on Stagonolepis,            which
appeared in 1875 and 1877, and papers on the Skull.       The facts that
he called a communication to the Royal Society, in 1875. on Amphi-
oxus,    a preliminary note, and that a paper read to the Zoological
Society in 1876, on Ceratodus Forsteri, was marked No. 1 of the
series of Contributions   to Morphology, showed that he still had before
him the prospect of much anatomical work, to be accomplished when
opportunity offered; but, alas! the opportunity which came was
small, the preliminary note had no full successor, and No. 1 was only
followed, and that after an interval of seven years, by abrief No. 2.
A paper " On the Characters of the Pelvis," in the 'Proceedings of
the Royal Society,' in 1879, is full of suggestive thought, but its con
cluding passages seem to suggest that others, and not he himself,
 were to carry out the ideas.     Most of the papers of this decenninm
 deal with    vertebrate  morphology, and are more or less connected
 with his former researches, but in one respect, at least, he broke
 quite fresh ground.     He had chosen the crayfish aa one of the lessons
 for the class in general biology spoken of above, and was thus drawn
 into an interesting study of crayfishes, by which he was led to a
 novel and important analysis of the gill plumes as evidence of affinity
 and separation.      He embodied the main results of his studies in a
 paper to the Zoological Society, and treated the whole subject in a
 more popular style in-a book on the Crayfish. In a somewhat similar
 way, having taken the dog as an object lesson in mammalian anatomy
 for his students, he was led to a closer study of that common animal,
 resulting in papers on the subject to the Zoological Society in 1880,
 and in two lectures at the Royal Institution in 1880. He had intended
 so to develop this study of the dog as to make it tell the tale of
  mammalian morphology ; but this purpose, too, remained unaccom
  plished.
     Richer, perhaps, even than preceding decennia was this one in
  scientific addresses and general lectures, in which his ripened judg
  ment drew from his immense store of knowledge wise lessons for his
  younger brethren. Conspicuous among these was one on a theme in
  which he might feel justifiable pride, the Friday Evening Royal
  Institution Lecture in 1880, " On the Coming of Age of the Origin of
  Species."
     The decennium of the eighties found him much as the previous
  decenninm had left him, but with official and multifarious duties
  gathering still thicker round him. In 1881, the Royal School of
  Mines was incorporated with the newly established Normal School
  of Science (which later on, in 1891, came to be called the Royal
   College of Science), and Huxley exchanged the title of Lecturer
  on General Natural History for that of Professor of Biology. He

                                    Ixm
was also made Dean of the College, serving actively in that office up
to the time of his retirement ; indeed, even at the time of his death,
he was nominally      Dean. In 1881 he accepted, upon pressure, the
duties of Inspector of Fisheries, which office he held till 1885,
bringing at once exact technical knowledge and acute political
sagacity to bear on problems of peculiar difficulty, and, as on other
occasions, suatching the fruit of scientific inquiry out of the oppor
tunities of routine business.
    In 1880 he had felt it his duty to resign the office of Secretary to
the Royal Society, but in 1883, npon the lamented death of "William
Spottiswoode, he was called upon, by the united voice of the Society,
to fill the Presidential Chair.     He gladly undertook the duties, for,
as has been said, his ideal of the part which the Society ought to
play towards that advancement of natural knowledge for which it was
founded was of the highest.         He looked forward to so using his
position as to develop still further the Society's usefulness, and had
in his mind plans for changes of a gradual and judicious kind which
might safely bring this about. But it was not to be, the ill-health
which had seemed to vanish in the seventies came back now with
increased force, and in 1885 he felt himself bound to resign the post.
    Indeed the ill-health now became grave ; the strain caused by the
long-continued painful illness of a favourite daughter, ending in her
death in 1887, told heavily upon him. Symptoms of cardiac mischief,
 which had probably been slowly developing for a long time past, now
 became pressing; and in 1885 he resigned his official duties at South
 Kensington, retaining the title of Emeritus Professor and, at the
 solicitation of the authorities, the post, which he had held so long, of
 Dean of the College. His active connection with the Survey had
 ceased about 1881, though up to this time his name still appeared as
 that of naturalist to it.
    An attack of pleurisy in 1886, followed by another in 1887, raised
 grave forebodings among his friends ; but judicious care and an
 innate recuperative power restored him to temporary strength.
 He found great benefit to his health from occasional visits to
 Easthourne, where he afterwards built himself a house, to which he
 moved in 1890, giving up his London residence.
     His experience as Inspector of Fisheries led him to investigate and
 write, in 1882, an account of the saprophytic diseases of salmon ; ho
 also contributed short papers to the Zoological Society, and, in 1887,
 one to the Geological Society, on Hyperodapedon Oordoni, those fossils
 to which fate had led him against his will occupying his attention
 almost to the last.       But one marked effect of his illness was to
 produce a condition in which anatomical research became a burden
 to him.      Though he carried about him, as does every man of
 like calibre and experience, a heavy load of fragments of inquiry
                                                              h 2

                                    lxiv
 begun but never finished, and as heavy a load of ideas for promising
 investigations never so much as even touched, though his love of
 science and belief in its might never wavered, though he never
 doubted the value of the results which further research would surely
 bring him, there was something working in him which made his hand,
  when turned to anatomical science, so heavy that he could not lift it.
  Not even that which was so strong within him, the duty of fulfilling
  a promise, could bring him to the work.         In his room at South
  Kensington,  where  for a quarter   of a century he had laboured with
 anch brilliant effect, there lay on his working table for months,
  indeed for years, partly dissected specimens of the rare and little-
 studied marine animal, Spirula, of which he had promised to con
 tribute an account to the Reports of the "Challenger" Expedition,
 and hard by lay the already engraven plates ; there was still wanted
 nothing more than some further investigation and the working out of
 the results.    But it seemed as if some hidden hands were always
 being stretched out to keep him from the task ; and eventually
 another labourer had to complete it.
    Not that the intellectual power was wanting, but that the mind
 could not work freely in the old fields and on the old lines. A new
 subject he took up with avidity.        Attracted in his walks round
 Maloja in the Engadine, whither he had been sent for his health, by the
 various species of gentian, he threw himself with ardour into the
                                             '
 study of that genus, and published in the Proceedings of the Linnean
         '
 Society a memoir dealing with the morphology of the gentian, and
 proposing a classification based on characters of distinct morpholo
gical value. As the work of one who, as he himself has said, had little or
nothing of the naturalist in him, and recked little of species, and who,
 moreover, never had the opportunity of gaining that almost instinc
 tive appreciation of the value of botanical characters which comes to
 those whose lives are spent among flowers, the memoir is in many
respects a remarkable one.
    Bat the new topics in which his mind now moved with the
greatest freedom, were those of philosophy and, through philosophy,
those of theology.    Not that they were really new, for his mind had
exercised itself in them from his youth upward, but it was a new
thing to him to be able to give his undivided attention to them.
And nearly the whole of his time in his retreat at Easthourne, save
that which was given to public demands, such as those of the British
Museum, of the University of London, to the senate of which he
had for some years belonged, and of the Mariue Biological Association,
which had been founded chiefly through his powerful influence, and
maintained largely through his constant cordial support, was devoted
to the study of philosophy and theology, indeed chiefly the latter, the
results of his meditations being from time to time laid before the

                                   Ixv
world in addresses or magazine articles.      Philosophy indeed was the
 occasion of his almost last appearance in public, when, at Oxford in
 May, 1893, he delivered the second Romanes lectnre on " Evolution
 and Ethics." Not the very last. The last time a large audience gazed
 upon him was at the meeting of the British Association at Oxford in
 August, 1894, when, rising to second the vote of thanks to the Presi
 dent, the Marquis of Salisbury, for the Presidential address, he was
 received with a burst of applause of such a kind as seldom falls to the
 lot of any man of science or, indeed, to any man at all. A smaller
 but no less sympathetic and admiring audience greeted him when the
 Royal Society, at its Anniversary Meeting in November of the same
year, bestowed on him the only token of regard left for it to give, but
that a most fitting one, the recently established Darwin Medal.        Two
men, and two men only, had received it before him, Joseph Dalton
 Hooker and Alfred Russel Wallace ; and the Society, in adding tho
name of Huxley to these, felt glad that it had been put in their power
to do honour in their lifetime to the three who, next to Darwin, had
had the greatest share in the eventful biological movement of the
present age.
   At the time he received the Medal his health seemed so good that
his friends looked forward to some yet considerable lease of life for
him, and, indeed, during the following winter he was cheerfully
active in his philosophic and theologic studies, and, besides, continued
to exert himself no little in the movement for a Teaching University
for London, a matter he had greatly at heart. But, in the early
spring, an attack of influenza, from which malady he had on former
occasions suffered greatly, prostrated him.       His illness was further
aggravated by   the  attempts  which  he made  to  complete, in spite of
                                                                       it,
a review, of which a    part had already appeared, of the Right Hon. A.
J. Balfour's work on Tho Foundations of Belief.' And, though he
                       '
seemed after a while to rally somewhat, disease of the kidney, which,
due primarily to his cardiac affection, had probably existed in a more
or less latent condition for some time, assumed characters of great
severity, pulmonary and pericardial complications followed, and after
days of great suffering ho expired on Juno 29, 1895. He was buried
in the Marylebone cemetery at Finchley, to the north of London.
   Titular honours had no attractions for Huxley, and    it   is no secret
that he at a comparatively early date declined the offer of knighthood.
At one time serious efforts were made in the direction of his being
created a peer, but financial reasons,   ifnone other, stopped them at
the very beginning.      Not that he was insensible to the value of a
public recognition of his worth, for when, in 1892, Her Majesty was
graciously pleased that he should become a member of the Privy
Council, he accepted with pleasure so unwonted a signal of the recog
nition of scientific worth.

                                       lxvi
    The world at large knew Huxley best perhaps in his special cha
racter as the fearless and effective exponent of Mr. Darwin's views,
and the minds who love to dwell on the " might have been " might
linger long questioning how soon those views would have moved the
world as they have done had there been no Huxley to expound them.
It knew him, too, in his more general character as one who taught to
the multitude the power and value of scientific thought in words
which, whether spoken or written, while flashing with wit, cut deep
with incisive power, reaching ear and eye in the shape of pure manly
English, the outcome of a strong, honest, clear-seeing mind; it
listened gladly to high themes of science touched by him with an
artist's hand ; and if,  at the close of the century, science stands high
in public estimation, that    is   in no small measure due to Huxley's
public  utterances,  and  the close  accord which his life showed to his
words. But his influence on the world at large formed, as it were,
only the diffusion circles of more direct rays of influence concentrated
on the narrower field of science and the still narrower field of biology.
The foregoing imperfect words have attempted to point out some of
the more important steps in the advancement of biologic knowledge
 which are directly due to him but these form only a part of what
                                   ;
we owe to him.         AVhatover bit of life he touched in his search,
protozoan, polyp, mollusc, crustacean, fish, reptile, beast, and man — and
there were few living things he did not touch — he shed light on it,
and left his mark. There       is    not one, or hardly one, of the many
things which he has written which may not be read again to-day with
pleasure and with profit and, not once or twice only in such a read
                          ;
ing,it   will be felt that the progress of science has given to words
 written long ago, a strength and meaning even greater than that
 which they seemed to have when first they were read.         Thereis  not
 a biologist of the latter half of this century who has not been helped
 on his way, directly or indirectly, by some research or by some word
 of Huxley's.    And though those who are coming after can never be
 fully aware of how great was the personal influence of the man out
 side his recorded words, the writings which do remain will serve to
 keep alive the memory of one who, while with his own hand he added
 many chambers to the growing building of biologic science, did
 almost as much by a life which taught both his comrades and lookers
 on the beauty, dignity, and power of natural knowledge.
    His record within the anuals of the Society   is   unique. Admitted
 a Fellow in 1851, he received a Royal Medal in 1852.        From 1871 to
 1880 he was one of the general secretaries.      From 1883 to 1885 he
 was President.     In 1888 the Copley, and in 1894 the Darwin, Medal
 were given him.      The Society could no further go.
                                                                 M. F.

    Henri Ernest Bâillon was born at Calais on November 29, 1827,
and died suddenly at Paris on July 18, 1895.               He was well known
personally in botanical circles in this country, having been a
frequent working visitor at Kew and the British Museum, to the
writer's knowledge, for upwards of thirty-three years ; and the
extent, scope, and quality of his botanical work have made his
name familiar to the botanists of all countries.                  The following
announcement of his death and particulars of his life, most of which
have already appeared in ' Nature,' were communicated to me by
Mr. A. Franchet the well-known writer on the botany of Eastern
Asia: —
    " Je vous écris sous une bien
                                          pénible impression ; M. Baillon est
mort hier soir subitement. Dans l'après-midi il etait venu au labora
toire selon son habitude.         A cinq heures et demie il prit un bain ; à
six heures son fils rentrant de l'École de Médecine le trouva mort.
On croit que le bain, un peu trop chauffé, a determiné une conges
tion.
    " C'est une grande perte pour nous et pour la botanique. S'il avait
des ennemis implacables, il avait aussi des amities fidèles.                 Je ne
doute pas que l'avenir no montre que derrière un esprit, dont les
manifestations parfois acerbes visait moins la personnalite que ce
qu'il jugeait être l'erreur, se cachait un cœur sensible à l'excès.              Il
est un bon nombre do ses élèves pauvres qui savent de quelles délica
tesses il savait entourer une aumône.
    " Quoiqu'il en soit, c'etait un grand botaniste ; vous le jugez ainsi,
n'est-ce pas ?
    " Ses quatres enfants vont so trouver dans la misère la plus pro
fonde qu'on puisse imaginer.           Ce qu'il n'a pas dépensé de sa fortune
pour la publication de ses livres a disparu dans la gouffre des dettes
do celle qui a porte son nom.          Aujourd'hui il ne reste rien."
    Having      written   for  further  particulars, the following reply was
received :    —
    " Henri Baillon* est né à Calais le 29 novembre, 1827, d'une
famille très honorablement comine dans la ville et dans la région, it
fit de très brillantes etudes au lycée de Versailles et commença ses
etudes médicales à dix-sept ans.            En 1854 nous le voyons Interne à
l'Hôpital de la Pitie à Paris et ses travaux dans cet fonction, déjà
 très difficile à obtenir au concours, furent si brillants, qu'il obtint à
l'unanimité la médaille d'or de l'Internat, c'est-à-dire la plus haute
 récompense qui puisse être decernée par la Faculte de Médecine.
 Son concours pour l'aggrégation fat un triomphe.                 Admirablement
 doué pour la parole, il tint véritablement sous le charme son jury
 tout entier, aussi bien par l'élégance de sa diction que par la pro-

 fondeur de ses vues scientifiques.         En 1863 il succéda à Moquin-
 Tandon dans la chaire de botanique de l'École de Médecine, et il a
 occupé cette chaire jusqu'à sa mort.
      " Il ne fût pas membre de l'Academie des Sciences !
      " Vous connaissez ses écrits ; ils forment à eux seuls une petite
 bibliothèque.      La veille de sa mort il me remettait le fascicule qui
 complétait le tome      XIII          '
                              de son Histoire des Plantes,' et la feuille 51
            '
 de son Bulletin de la Societé Linnéenne.'               A cette occasion il me
 donna la composition du volume XIV de l'Histoire des Plantes,' qui
                                                  '
devait comprendre les Zingibéracées, les Musacées, et enfin les
 Orchidees, qui terminaient l'ouvrage au point de vue de l'exposition
des familles.       Mais ce volume devait aussi fournir l'exposé du plan
de ' l'Histoire des Plantes,' de la methode suivie, des caractères sur
 lesquels il basait sa classification.    L'absence d'un document qui eut
été si precieux pour l'intelligence complete de celui de ces livres
auquel il attachait le plus de l'importance, est une perte irrépar
able pour la science.
     " Certains journaux de basse catégorie ont dit que Baillon s'était
suicide ; c'est un mensonge. J'ai passé avec lui toute l'après-midi du
mercredi. Il m'a non seulement parlé de ses projets d'avenir pour
 '
   l'Histoire des Plantes,' mais aussi pour Madagascar, et aussi pour
ses enfants.      Il souhaitait tant vivre pour conduire son fils jusqu'à
l'internat des hôpitaux, tout au moins ! Et puis eu me quittant il
 m'a récité, ce qu'il faisait souvent et très bien, une ode presque
 entière d'Horace, et une partie de cette ode Française, " La France a
perdu son Orphée," etc. Cette ode il me l'a disait d'une merveilleuse
façon au moins cinq à six fois par an.
     " Mais
              je m'arrête, car je pourrais longtemps vous parler ainsi de
lui."
     I  have given the foregoing letters, from one who knew Baillon
intimately, in full, because the false rumours alluded to concerning
his end were circulated in this country.
     The allusion to Baillon's personal character will appeal to the
sympathies of those who knew him on this side of the Channel.
He was singularly amiable and courteous in his general behaviour ;*
yet he quarrelled with some of the foremost French botanists of
assured position, which led to regrettable and undignified recri
minations ou his part, and resulted in closing the doors of the
Academie des Sciences against him for ever.                This embittered his
life considerably, and rendered his relations with a section of the
botanists of Paris almost unbearable.
     In 1875 he was elected a foreign member of the Linnean Society
of London, and in 1894 he received the same distinction from the
    * From this point   I havo oxtracted entirely   from  mv notice in

Royal Society.      This gave him mnch pleasure, and consoled him, in
some measure, for the implacability of his own countrymen.              In
1866 he and a few others founded the Societe Linneenne de Paris.
He was elected President, and continued to act as such until his
death. For some years the Proceedings of this very small Society
were published in Baillon's own periodical, ' Adansonia,' and then a
'
   Bulletin Mensuel ' appeared, and has continued to appear down to
the present time, entirely owing to the energy and industry of
the President.      This organ was not published, but distributed to
the leading botanical establishments ; hence, there is no record of
Baillon's numerous articles therein in the Royal Society's catalogne
of scientific papers.   Yet, omitting these, the catalogue contains the
titles of 230 of his papers, published between 1854 and 1883. But
Baillon was a most prolific writer, and covered a considerable range,
though systematic botany was his chief study.          I   need only name
      '                                                  '
his Adansonia,' twelve      volumes,   1866 to 1879 ; Dictionnaire       de
                                                 ' Histoire des Plantes,'
Botanique,' four volumes, 1876 to 1892;
 1867-95, and still unfinished.     Baillon, too, was the only French
botanist who occupied himself on the rich collections of flowering
 plants in Paris from Madagascar ; being the author of the uncom
          '
pleted Histoire des Plantes de Madagascar,' forming a portion of
Grandidier's great work on Madagascar.
    Baillon was one of the few existing botanists having a good
knowledge of the phanerogamic flora of the world.             As a writer,
 however, he was more critical than methodical, and many of his
original observations and suggestions have been overlooked by
 botanists who have subsequently gone over the same ground. This
 is owing to the fact that the titles of many of his articles do not
 sufficiently describe their contents. Not infrequently a new genus
 or a new species is described in the body of a paragraph, and some
 times so informally, that only by careful reading is it possible to
 arrive at the fact. This often caused the author himself chagrin,
 especially as he was very sensitive and apt to believe that his work
 had been purposely ignored.     I had almost forgotten to mention that
                                                                     '
  the Euphorbiaceae were one of his favourite families, and his Etude

  Generale du Gronpe des Euphorbiacees       is one of his most finished
 works. I cannot here enter into a more critical examination of his
 works, but I may add that the illustrations almost throughout are of
 a high order of merit.
                                                                W. B. H.
     William Toplky was born at Greenwich,      on  March    13, 1841. His
  early education was obtained at local schools ; he entered the Royal
  School of Mines in 1858, and remained a student there till 1861.
     His active geological career began in 1862, when he was appointed
                                                                  h 3

                                    lxx
 an Assistant Geologist on the Government Geological Survey of the
 United Kingdom.       It was a stirring time in the geological world.
 Hutton had clearly enunciated, and Scrope had emphasized           the
 doctrine that the ground had been carved into its present form by
 the action of subaerial denudation.    But the old notion that the sea
 had been the main agent in this work still held sway.     The question
was now again being brought to the front by the vigorous advocacy
of Greenwood, and debated by such men as the late Sir A. C.
 Ramsay, Mr. (now Sir) A. Geikie, nnd others of less note ; but there
 was to be some fierce fighting before anything like unanimity of
opinion could be arrived at. There are very few districts better
 suited to test the relative value of the two views than the Weald of
 Kent and Sussex, and it was thither that Mr. Topley was sent to
 work under the direction of Dr. (now Professor) C. le Neve Foster.
In 1865 they furnished one of the most important contributions to
the controversy in their paper,
                                   " On the
                                            Superficial Deposits of the
Medway, with Remarks on the Denudation of the Weald." (' Quart.
Journ. Geol. Soc.,' xxi, (1865) 443). By this memoir, Mr. Topley,
at the very outset of his career, did much towards settling a long-
debated point in geological speculation.
   In addition to Messrs. Topley and Foster, several members of the
staff of the survey took part in the mapping of the Weald ; but on
the completion of the work all but Topley had resigned, and to him
was entrusted the task of writing the memoir descriptive of the area.
It gives a masterly account of the great leading features in the
structure of the district ; liable to modification it has necessarily
proved as to details, but it is and will long remain the standard
work on the subject.
   On the completion of his Wealden work, Mr. Topley was trans
ferred to the Carboniferous district of Northumberland, and in 1880
was recalled to London to superintend the publication of the maps
and memoirs of the survey at the office in Jermyn Street. Here and
at this work he remained till his death.
   But a sketch of Mr. Topley's official career, and a notice of some
of his more important work in the domain of pure science gives no
idea of the many sided character of his tastes and occupations.
   From the first he was strongly attracted towards the practical
side of geology.       The aid' that it can give to the agriculturist
occupied a good deal of his attention ; and a work on soils, for which
he had collected much material, is one of the many projects which
his early death prevented him from finishing.      Ho was also an au
thority on water supply, on which subject his advice was sought by
engineers.    Among the schemes on w^hiuh he was consulted, that
for bringing water from Mid- Wales to Birmingham, was one of the
most important.      The writer was here associated with him, and can

                                    Ixxi
 bear witness that he was as much at home among the complicated
and disturbed rocks of Palaeozoic age, as when dealing with he
simpler structures of Mosozoic formations.
   He wrote also on the bearings of Geology on Sanitary Science, on
Petroleum, the distribution of Gold and Silver, and the Channel
Tunnel.    Mnch of his time was occupied in the share which he took
in the work of scientific bodies. For fifteen years he acted as
 Secretary to Section C of the British Association ; and he took an
active part in the proceedings of the International Geological Con
gress, undertaking the laborious duties of Secretary when that body
met in London in 1888, and he consented to superintend the British
portion of the Geological Map of Europe which is being prepared
under its auspices.      He also, in conjunction with Mr. Sherborn,
                       '                    '
acted as editor of the Geological Record during the last two years of
its existence ; a task as toilsome as it was thankless. He was elected
a Fellow of the Geological Society in 1862 ; an Associate of the
Institute of Civil Engineers in 1874; and a Fellow of the Royal
Society in 1888.
   A goodly record this of work done, or cut short only by the hand
of death.   Yet it was not to science alone that Mr. Topley's leanings
inclined.   His appreciation of art in all its branches was a source of
pleasure  which   he delighted to share with thoso friends whose tastes
lay in this direction.
   But it was not his indefatigable industry nor his broad culture
that endeared him to those who knew him best.           In spite of the
poignancy of the regret which his unexpected removal must
engender, they can look back with pleasure to that sunny geniality,
which made him the best of companions ; to the unselfishness which
led him, no matter at what inconvenience to himself, to give with
open hand whatever help he could whenever it was asked for ; and
to the warmth of heart which was a source of happiness alike to him
self and to those who shared his friendship.
   The disease which landed him in an early grave appears to have
been brought on by drinking contaminated water during a visit to
Algiers in 1894. He hurried home more dead than alive, and reached
it only to die.
