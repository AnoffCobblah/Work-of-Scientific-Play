along the 40th parallel in North America between the Atlantic Ocean
and Salt Lake City. Magnetic observations have been made, with
more or less assiduity, at different places in the eastern States for
many years past; but of the immense tract of country lying between
the Mississippi and the Pacific Ocean there is only a single determina
tion of one of the three elements indicated on Sir Edward Sabine's
maps, viz., a determination of declination at Salt Lake City. A series
of observations was made some years since by United States' officers
along the Mexican frontier, and a similar series was carried out by
the English and American officers employed on the North American
Boundary Commission.       The present set of observations was made,
therefore, along the district which lies midway between the line of
observations already run along the northern and southern boundaries
of the United States’ territory.
   The instruments employed formed part of the admirable magnetic
equipment belonging to Owens College, Manchester, and were kindly
placed at the disposal of the author by the Council of the College. At
the commencement and end of the survey a complete series of observa
tions was made at Kew, which was adopted as a base station; and a
similar set was made at Washington in the magnetic observatory be
longing to Mr. Charles A. Schott, of the United States’ Coast Survey
Department, with a view of obtaining an independent check on the
indications of the instruments.   The author learned from Mr. Schott
that the Coast Survey Department is gradually accumulating data for a
discussion of the magnetic history of the American continent. It has
already published a map of declination for 1870, from which it is
evident that much has been done in the determination of this par
ticular element since the date of Sir E. Sabine's memoirs, more
especially along the Pacific slope, and in the regions to the west and
south-west of the Great Salt Lake. As yet, however, no observations
have been published relating to any of the districts west of the          Missis
sippi visited by the author.

    From (5) it is     easy   to pass to the potential of a magnetic pole
at   f, g, h, due to    unit current circulating in the boundary of the
ellipse, and thence to the expansion in harmonics for the mutual
potential energy of the currents in two elliptic circuits in any positions.
      Results similar to (4) and (5) can also be easily found for solid

      bearing on other Phenomena of the Glacial Period.”                By
       JOSEPH   PRESTWICH,     M.A.,  F.R.S.,  F.G.S.,  &c., Professor of
       Geology in the University of Oxford.          Received March 27,
       1879.
                                 (Abstract.)
   Of the various hypotheses that have been brought forward since the
time of Macculloch and Dick-Lauder to account for the origin of the
Parallel Roads of Glen Roy, the one so ably propounded by
Mr. Jamieson, in 1863, has been most generally received and adopted.
It is a modification of the views originally expressed by Agassiz, to
the effect that the barriers of the lakes,—to the shore action of which
both the above-named geologists attributed the “roads,” but were at
a loss to account both for the formation and removal of barriers,—
had been formed during the glacial period by glaciers issuing from
Glen Treig and Glen Arkaig, supplemented by others from Ben Nevis.
The subsequent determination, by the Scotch geologists, of an inter
mediate milder period succeeded          by a second cold period, led
Mr. Jamieson, with whom the preglacial and glacial deposits of
Scotland had been a subject of especial investigation, to conclude that
the extension of these two glaciers took place during the second cold
period, which he thinks was of little less intensity than the first, and
that, while the glacier from Glen Arkaig blocked up Glen Gluoy, the
glacier from Glen Treig formed a barrier to Glen Roy. He observes,
 “Grant, then, these two ice-streams, one in the Great Caledonian
Valley and the other at Glen Treig, and the problem of the Parallel
Roads can be solved, provided we allow that glaciers have the power
to dam such deep bodies of water as must have occupied Glen Gluoy
and Glen Roy.”
   Mr. Jamieson, in support of this view, adduces the extensive glacia
tion apparent at the entrance both of Glen Arkaig and of Glen Treig,
 and shows that near the entrance of Glen Gluoy there are ice striae,
 pointing W. 5° N., or in the direction that a glacier coming from Glen
 Arkaig would take, and that, in the Spean Valley, opposite Glen
 Treig, the ice striae are transverse to the valley, or in the direction of
 the axis of Loch Treig, while on either side they point respectively up
 and down Glen       Spean.    He infers, consequently, that the central

portion of the glacier ascended the opposite hill to the Col of Glen
Glaster, while another portion passed down the valley blocking Glen
Roy, and a third portion travelled up the valley eastward to the Pass
of Makoul, and thence into the valley of the Spey.
   The “roads” were, he considers, formed by long-continued shore
action at each successive level of the lake, that level being determined
by the height of the cols over which the lake waters escaped.         In
proof of the long duration of the lakes, Mr. Jamieson refers to the
dimensions of the “roads,” and the large size of the mounds at the
junction of Glen Turret and Glen Roy, and of that at the entrance of
the Gulban in Glen Spean, which mounds he considers to be deltas
formed by the respective streams flowing into the old lakes.
   To these views it has been objected, by Mr. Milne-Home and others,
that it is difficult to conceive the glens to the north of the Spean
Valley to have been filled with water while at the same time those on
the south were filled with ice, and he advocates a detrital barrier
formed of clay, sand, and gravel, by marine origin, when the sea stood
some 3,000 feet higher than at present. There                              to is,

                       is   a                 accounting for the origin

                                                such vast barriers.
   Professor Nicol, also, has pointed out that, had lakes existed     Glen                             in
Gluoy, Glen Roy, and Glen Spean for the length            time required         of                              to
form the “roads”           by
                       erosion, and     accumulate the deltas, the cols by
                                                 to

sequence    of the detrital matter taking, as it successively fell and was
removed, the same angle of repose as that which the detrital slopes
originally had, that angle being the same in water as in air. But the
angle of the slopes varies from 25° to 35°, whereas, the angle of repose
of such loose materials as would fall down the slopes is as high as
38° to 40°.
    Besides these objections to Mr. Jamieson's hypothesis, which the
author considers valid, he points out the difficulty of conceiving that
the Arkaig glacier, which was fed by mountains not more than 2,000
or 3,240 feet high, and had to travel, not down a steep gradient, but
along a level lake basin 12 miles long, then to traverse Loch Lochy,
457 feet deep, could have ascended the hills at the entrance of Glen
 Gluoy to a height of not less than 1,200 feet, while at the same time a
pass existed at the head of the glen only 500 feet high, which presented
a ready outlet to the west coast.      Or, if prevented from taking that
course, why should not the       Arkaig glacier, when it issued into the
 Great Glen, have taken the line of least resistance and passed either up
or down the Great Glen, where the gradients are so small?
    It is a question also whether active glaciers such as Mr. Jamieson
requires, could have formed permanent dams to the large bodies of
 water pent up in Glen Gluoy and Glen Roy.             Glacier lakes are
occasionally formed in the Alps, as in the instance of the Margelen
See, by glaciers when below the snow line, passing lateral glens whose
 streams they dam back, but they are much more common in the
 Himalayas.     These lakes, however, never last many seasons.         The
 glacier is constantly on the move, and so long as it presents an
unbroken front to the lake, so long is the barrier efficient, but when
in the progress of the glacier a fissured mass of ice comes forward,
the water at once escapes with greater or lesser rapidity, and cannot
 again accumulate until the defective ice has travelled past or the
leak is repaired by winter frosts.                             -
    In the known recent instances of such glacier lakes, they are so
 small compared to the great mass of the glaciers, that the latter are
 not affected by the escape of the lakes—the fissures only are
 enlarged; but with the great size of the Glen Roy and Glen Spean
 lakes, and the enormous pressure exercised by columns of water 500
 to 800 feet deep, would the preservation of the barriers and the
 restoration of the lake be possible P
    Equally difficult is it to imagine the existence of such vast glaciers
 as those of Glen Arkaig and Glen Treig, while the opposite glens of
 the Gluoy and Roy remained free from ice. For the hills around
 Glen Arkaig are but little higher than those around Glen Gluoy, and
 not so high as those around Glen Roy; those to the eastward of the
 latter valley are in fact nearly equal in height to the range on the
 south of the Spean with the single exception of Ben Nevis and the

1879.]             of  the Parallel Roads of Lochaber.                     9
adjacent Ben Aonach.       The difference is too slight to allow of so great
a variation in the level of the snow line, and the cause suggested by
Mr. Jamieson, viz., a great difference in the rainfall such as it now
obtains in this district, can scarcely be maintained, for although the
annual fall at Fort William is 86 inches, and at Laggan 46 inches, the
rainfall at Roy Bridge has now been found to be as much as 62 inches.
Further, for the argument to be of any value, it should be shown that
in the country further eastward where the rainfall is much less, there
was the like absence of glaciers during the second period, whereas
Chambers and other geologists, including Mr. Jamieson himself, have
shown that during that period local glaciers descended from every
mountain range, approaching or exceeding 3,000 feet in height—a
height attained as already remarked by the hills to the north as well
as by those to the south of the Spean.
   With respect to the so-called “deltas” of the Turret in Glen Roy,
and of the Gulban in Glen Spean, which are supposed to have accumu
lated during the long time that the lakes filled the valleys, the author
shows that the structure of the former is not in accordance with the
bedded structure of deltas, but on the contrary that it is formed of
unstratified moraine débris 50 to 80 feet thick, with a thin coating of
gravel water-worn and reconstructed from the underlying mass, and .
that the angle of terminal slope is not that of original deposition, but
is due to wearing back of the terrace by the Roy, and the fall of the
débris by weathering.                                                -
   The foregoing are the objections raised by the author to the hypo
thesis of Mr. Jamieson, but while objecting to this exposition of the
glacial theory, he considers that that theory affords the most satis
factory solution of the problem, only that he would suggest a different
interpretation  in explanation of the phenomena, the description of
which he does not think it necessary to repeat.
                             Views of the Author.
   Dismissing the hypothesis of local glaciers of the second period of
glaciation, the author falls back upon the original idea of Agassiz with
the development acquired by more recent research, and assigns the
Lochaber lakes to the close of the first period of great glaciation.      He
considers the  phenomena     are due to the  peculiar  physiographical   con
dutions of the district, and shows that owing to the configuration of
the country, the drainage of the Ben Nevis range instead of flowing off
from the centre to two or more sides, is all diverted northward into
the lower part of the Spean Valley and the Great Glen near Fort
William.     These conditions which now give this area an excess of
water drainage, must in the like manner, during the glacial period,
have there led to an exceptional accumulation of ice.

 10                Prof. J. Prestwich.      On the Origin          [May 1,
    The observations of MacLaren,     Chambers, Milne-Home, Jamieson,
 James Geikie and others, sufficiently prove the great thickness of the
 ice covering in this part of Scotland during the first period of intense
glaciation.    On the flanks of the Ben Nevis range, glacial striae extend
to a   height   of more than 2,000 feet, while on the hills facing this
range, and on the opposite side of the Spean Valley, such striae have
been traced to nearly the same height, as for example to nearly the
summit of Craig Dhu near the entrance of Glen Roy, and on the hills
above the Rough Burn by Mr. Milne-Home to a height of 1,600 feet.
Everywhere, the rocks in the lower parts of Glen Spean are intensely
glaciated, as are also those at the head of Glen Roy and around the
Cols of Glen Glaster and Makoul.          At the same time, the erratic
blocks with those beds of sand and    gravel  of foreign origin which have
been found widely distributed over the hills around Glen Roy to
heights of from 800 to 2,100 feet, afford confirmatory testimony of
the depth of the land ice which then covered the country.        There can
be little doubt therefore of the vast extent and general spread of the
ice-sheet at the first period of glaciation.
    With the incoming of this glacial period, local glaciers must have
descended    from every mountain range, and so long as the glacier of
one steep glen became confluent with another of the same chain flow
ing in the same general direction, so long would their course be
uninterrupted, and the propelling and abrading force maintained, as
in the Alps at the present day; but when, emerging from these glens
into valleys of small gradients dividing the several mountain chains,
they met with glaciers descending from these other ranges, their pro
gress was not only subject to be checked, and their forces neutralised,
but their course diverted, for if the lines of natural drainage
were barred, the ice took those of least resistance, although such
might be up-hill and against the lines of drainage. This, however,
could not be effected without excessive pressure and heaping up of
the ice at the points of junction.
   These interferences must have been especially frequent in the valley
of the Spean. On the one side, the glaciers descending the steep
ravines of Larig Leachach, the Cour and others on the northern
flank of the Ben Nevis range, issued into Glen Spean and projected
across it to the Glen Roy hills opposite. Below to the west, the great
Nevis Glen glacier emerged into the valley of the Lochy, while
above to the east the great glacier from Glen Treig turned down
Glen Spean, but, meeting with the aforesaid group of glaciers from
Ben Nevis, was partly diverted over the flanks of Craig Dhu, and
upon the entrance to Glen Roy.
   While the glaciers from this system of mountains were becoming
confluent in and filling Glen Spean, those from the opposite range
of hills were descending Glen Roy, Glen Feitheil, the Rough

  1879.]             of the Parallel Roads of Lochaber.                  11
  Burn, and the other ravines of that chain, and coming into collision
  with those of the Ben Nevis range. In the same way, the valley of
  Loch Eil, Glen Nevis, Glen Mhuilinn, Glen Loy, and others were
 focussing their glaciers upon the end of the Great Glen north of Ben
  Nevis, barring in that direction the passage of the ice down Glen
  Spean, and diverting it northward towards Loch Lochy and Loch
  Oich.
     The ice therefore descending Glen Spean, in consequence of these
  obstructions, accumulated in mass in the lower part of that valley
  opposite Glen Roy, until overcoming further resistance and confluent
  with the Ben Nevis glaciers it wheeled round into the Great Glen at
  Loch Lochy, where the united stream found not only a more con
  tracted passage, but met also at right angles the glacier issuing from
  Glen Arkaig, by which it was forced against and up the entrance to
  Glen Gluoy opposite.
     This direction of the flow is in accordance with ice striae noticed by
 Mr. Jamieson on the flank of Strone-y-Vaa, and by Mr. J. Campbell,
 of Islay, to the west of Spean Bridge; but it is not so readily recon
 cileable with those at the entrance of Glen Gluoy.            It may be a
 question, however, whether the striae, in the Spean Valley, facing and
 flanking the entrance to Glen Treig, are all to be interpreted in the
 way suggested by Mr. Jamieson. . There is no doubt from the direction
 of the   striae, and the position  of the transported boulders, that the
 mass of the Treig glacier struck across the valley of the Spean, and
 turned down its channel westward; but that a part ascended to the
 Col of Glen Glaster, and another passed up the Spean Valley is
 doubtful. It is more probable that this glacier after traversing Strath
 Spean, met with glaciers coming down Glen Feitheil and the Rough
 Burn, which caused it to turn down the Spean Walley, while it barred
 the passage of these other glaciers and diverted them up the valley
 in the direction of Loch Laggan and over the Pass of Makoul.           The
direction of the striae observed by the author between the Rough Burn
and Moy, points, he considers, to ice coming down from the hills on
the north and joining the main east stream.
      The effects of these great conflicting ice streams were not confined
to the piling up and accumulation of the ice only. Although glaciers
confined by the walls of narrow glens, and descending steep slopes
exercise great abrading power, the observations of Charpentier and
others show that when they emerge into broader and flatter valleys, they
may pass over beds of loose detritus without disturbance except that of
pressure. The terminal moraines of the many glaciers emerging into
Glen Spean may, according to the varying conditions of the ice, have
been pushed forward or rolled over by the ice, while the meeting of
conflicting glaciers must have led to the deposition and heaping up of
the glacial débris at the points of junction. The many checks and

12                Prof. J.  Prestwich.     On the Origin          [May  1,
blocks that must have occurred during the growth of the great ice
sheet—the neutralisation of the ice-force in one place, and the
centralisation of it in others—will serve to explain much that is
peculiar in the distribution of this sub-glacial débris or Till, not only
in Lochaber, but in other parts of the country, and at all levels.
    The author then points out the many mounds and terraces in the
Spean Valley formed of moraine detritus, though since levelled and
often masked by a covering of gravel due to subsequent water action.
To this cause also he attributes the large accumulation of débris at the
entrance to Glen Roy, between Bohuntine and Glen Glaster, where he
shows it to be in places 200 to 300 feet deep, and to consist of a light
grey argillaceous unstratified matrix with angular fragments of the local
rocks capped by stratified gravel. The mass rises nearly to the level
of the lower parallel road. Mr. Milne-Home has pointed out a similar
deposit at the entrance to Glen Collarig, while the large mass at the       .
entrance of Glen Spean, and now forming Unachan Hill, rising to a
height of 613 feet, has been often described.      The importance of these
great deposits in the position occupied by the main ice barriers cannot
be overlooked, for though river action and denudation has removed
much of them, the portions which remain show how materially they
may have contributed with the ice in forming the great lake barriers.
    The next question discussed is the height of the land in relation to
the sea at the period of the great glaciation, as it is not possible to
 suppose that with the great changes of level which took place sub
sequently, there is now a return to the status quo ante of the earlier
period; and the author      sees reason to conclude that the land then
stood at not less than from 1,000 to 1,500 feet higher than at present,
so that the Irish Channel was then above the sea level, and land
extended a considerable distance westward from the present coast of
 Scotland.                                             -
    This was followed by a submergence of not less than 1,200 to
 1,500 feet in central and northern England, Wales, and Ireland, and
of 600 feet in the southern part of Scotland, as proved by the occur
 rence of marine shells at those heights.     There is no similar evidence,
 however, to show that it was more than 300 feet in Aberdeenshire, or
 175 feet off the north-west coast.    Still, it is not to be concluded on
 negative evidence alone of the absence of marine shells that the sea
 reached no higher over the north of Scotland.       Assuming there at all
 events a  submergence   of 400 to 500 feet below the present level, this,
 added to the previous elevation of 1,000 to 1,500 feet, would establish
 a difference of 1,500 to 2,000 feet between the period of great glacia
 tion and the succeeding period of submergence.
    This difference of level would produce a twofold effect upon the
 climate—the one resulting from altitude which would be equal to a
 rise in the mean temperature of from 4° to 6°F., and that caused by

 1879.]            of the Parallel Roads of Lochaber.                    13
the conversion of a continental area into an archipelago, for then in
consequence of the submergence, the Highlands of Scotland became
surrounded by an open sea with only the higher peaks of England,
Wales, and Ireland above the waters, and the warm currents of the
Atlantic reached the foot of the Scottish mountains. The effects of
the two causes could not be less than from 12° to 15° F., which is
about equivalent to the difference of climate between Paris and St.
 Petersburg.   There is also to be taken into account the probable
increase of heat consequent on the gradual diminution of those con
ditions, whatever they were, to which was owing the cold of the glacial
period.
   The effect of those changes was to produce a thaw which gradually
led to the destruction of the great ice-sheet, though subsequently other
changes brought for a time a return of cold sufficient to maintain local
glaciers in the higher mountain ranges. The conditions under which
the ice-sheet would be placed during this period would be similar to
that of glaciers where they extend below the snow line. In Europe
the glacier gradients are usually so steep and the ice is so fissured, that
even in such positions water rarely lodges on the surface; still it does
at some places give rise to small pools and streams, but in the Hima
layas, where glaciers descend into wide valleys with small gradients,
and the summer heat is considerable, the glaciers often become
covered with tarns and small lakes. They have been noticed by
 Sir J. D. Hooker and more lately by Colonel Godwin-Austen, who
 describes in the middle of one of these glaciers, a series of such lakes,
some being 500 yards in length and 200 to 300 in breadth, and of
great depth. As intervening barriers give way, these lakes descend
in course of time from lower to lower levels, and finally escape.
   In the same way the old ice-sheet must have become covered with
pools and lakes, for owing to the irregular surface of the ice, and the
inevitable absence of all channels of drainage, the water must every
where have lodged, until channels were formed, and a means of escape
established.   The extent of these bodies of water would depend upon
the height and permanence of the obstructions.          In the Lochaber
district they were, owing to the    causes  before named, of great size
and permanence, such as to form high barriers at the entrance to
Glen Roy, Glen Spean, and Glen Gluoy, behind which the waters
accumulated and rose until they found a channel of escape over the cols
at lower levels, when a permanent water-level would be established
so long as the main barriers existed.
   It is well known that the Parallel Roads are terraces composed of
perfectly angular fragments of the local rocks with a few rounded
pebbles both local and foreign to the district.     The former show an
entire absence of any prolonged beach wear. The wear of the latter
is due to other causes.   There is also an entire absence of any notch

or cliff line such as would be due to the wearing back of a shore line,
and of any projecting ledge such as would result from the throwing
forward of the shore débris. The slope of the hills above and below
the “roads” varies from 25° to 40°, and the inclination with the
horizon of the “roads” themselves, which are from 50 to 70 feet
wide, varies within the limits of from 5° to 30°.
   Of the internal structure of the “roads” very little is known.
The only published section is the one given by the Rev. Thomas Brown
in his paper on the “Parallel Roads.” This shows a thick substratum
of about 20 feet of sandy clay with angular débris and boulders, covered
by a thick seam of stratified clay, and then by 2 to 3 feet of clay with
stones.   There is no appearance in this section nor in another un
published section of Mr. Brown's, of any such structure as would
result from successive additions to the ledge by the tipping over of
débris removed from the shore.
    Although therefore the “roads” indicate       a line of water-level,
there is  nothing  in their form or structure to show that they have
been formed by the long-continued action of lake waters on a shore
line. To what then are they to be ascribed ?
   The first or highest “road” is confined to Glen Gluoy, the second
and third to Glen Roy, and the fourth or lowest to Glen Roy and
Glen Spean. What the conditions were immediately antecedent to the
formation of the first, second, and fourth road, is not shown, but in the
case of the      third road, the conditions preceding                         its   formation are                 to   be

 Mr. Drew to have been caused by the bursting of a detrital barrier
 formed by a landslip.      In consequence of this a lake had been formed,
 which he estimates to have been 35 miles long by 1 mile broad and
 300 feet deep at its lower end. The whole was drained in a day.
    In the same way, it is to be assumed that the Glen Glaster barrier,
 which was probably formed by a remnant of the glaciers descending
 from the mountain ranges (2,994 feet) at the head of the glen, at last
 gave way with great suddenness, and caused the rapid fall of the
 waters from the level of the higher “road” in Glen Roy to that of
 that glen's second “road,” at the height of the Glen Glaster Col, when
 the escape of the waters was stopped.
    Now, it must be borne in mind that, at this time, the great mantle
 of snow and ice which had so long covered the country, was passing:
 away, leaving the surface of the hills in Glen Roy covered with
 a thick coating of angular local débris mixed with sand and clay, the
result of the intense cold and of the decomposition of the underlying
schistose and granitic rocks. This and the glacial débris must have
long remained bare and unprotected by vegetation; at all events, that
below the water-line was so. Now, the angle of repose of purely
angular and subangular débris varies within the limits of from 35° to
48°, but that of clayey sands, which when dry is from 21° to 37°,
becomes, when saturated with water, as low as 14° to 22°.          The angle
of  repose of the hill-side débris  would, therefore, depend on the relative
proportion of the angular materials and their matrix, and on the extent
of saturation.     The slopes of the hills being on the whole greater than
that of the angle of repose of the saturated under-water rubble, this
latter, easily set in motion on to the settlement of its constituent
parts as the water drained from            would it,          as

need discussion, but they are not considered     more serious than these
which attend the other    hypothesis.
   The theoretical inferences of structure agree fairly well with the
facts so far as they are known. Mr. Brown’s “clay with boulders
indistinctly stratified with thin (lenticular) layers of sand,” repre
sents the sliding detrital mass, -the finely stratified sand and clay;
the sediment which subsided from the muddy lake waters after their
fall; and the 2 to 3 feet of stones with clay, -the subaerial fall of débris
from the slopes above.      In the substratum and overlying sediment,
Mr. Brown found four     species of fresh-water diatoms, while he found
none in the upper bed.      This fact serves to confirm the subaqueous
origin of the body of the  ledge, while it tends further to disprove the
                                                 -
marine  hypothesis.
   It has been before observed    that, in all the cols, there is an entire
absence of a defined water channel, such as would be worn by the
long-continued flow of a river, but in all of them there are traces of
strong water action, such as might result from the temporary passage
of a large and rapid body of water.
   With respect to the main barriers acting as dams to Glen Gluoy,
Glen Roy, and Glen Spean, they were due, as already pointed out, to
the circumstance of an accumulation of ice at these spots so excessive
and so high as to last long after the ice generally in the lower tracks
had given way.    Not, however, that any ice barrier could have been
permanent for a great period of time, but this the author's hypothesis
does not require.   In any case, an ice-barrier in a state of rest will
form a more effective barrier than when in motion.                          -
   Passing over the barrier at the entrance to Glen Gluoy, it is shown
that the point where the Glen Roy barrier existed is that where a
glacier coming down Glen Roy would meet in opposition the ice from
Ben Nevis and the Spean Valley; and that this glen was occupied by
a glacier is proved by the occurrence of glacial striae on the rocks
forming the bed of the valley near Dalriach, and of Till, or boulder
clay, lower down the valley, nearer Achavady.         But the great mass
of the latter lies precisely on the spot where the Ordnance Survey
have placed the line of barrier; it was there heaped up by the same
conflicting causes that produced the barrier of ice.          That it was
originally larger and higher is proved by        its
                                                occurring       on

 18                         Prof.      J. Prestwich.                  On the Origin                  [May 1,
variable as the problem has to deal with, the parallelism of the
“roads” with the horizon, which has been remarked on by all
observers from Macculloch downwards, could not have been main
 tained. For the detritus of the hill sides varies, however slightly,
 in the relative proportions of rock fragments and soil, while the slopes
 above and below the “roads” also vary in their angle, so that,
 as these conditions varied, so would the momentum of the sliding
 mass vary, whilst the resisting force of inertia would remain the
 same.   The consequence would necessarily be, that the slide would
continue at some places to a lower level than at others, and the line
of the “roads” could not be throughout parallel with the horizon.
    There is no doubt that, to all appearances, the “roads” are perfectly
level, and such was the opinion of the author when standing on them
and while working with the excellent 1-inch map of the Survey; but
afterwards, on referring to the elaborate 6-inch maps, he found the
levels there given clearly show that the “roads” are neither at the
exact height of the cols nor are they perfectly parallel with the
horizon, after allowing for the variable inclination of the “roads,”
and for the observations being made in their centre.
   Instead of a perfect level water line, the “roads” are really slightly
waved, the difference between the highest and lowest point being in
the four “roads” taken in descending order, 15, 11, 15, and 12 feet; and
while the level of the higher “roads” is in most instances below those
of     the several cols of escape, that of the lower          “road” is in all instances
above       it.   Thus

 escape   of the waters was consequently more prolonged, and the fall
 slower.
    Various   phenomena     in   connexion with the great ice-sheet in
 Lochaber and their connexion with the general question, are next
 considered.    The author objects to the term of moraine profonde to
 describe the drift of sub-glacial origin, as apt to lead to misunder
 standing, although Hogard and other geologists have used it in the
 wider sense.    It is evident that the old ice-sheet acted under very
 different conditions to an ordinary glacier, and it is better to use such
 terms as moraine detritus or sub-glacial detritus for the sum total of
 sub-glacial products of the former, than employ a term which was
 originally and still is generally restricted to a single and comparatively
 small product of the former.
    Besides this sub-glacial débris, there is the large quantity of débris
 that must have been scattered over the surface of the ice during its
 melting by streams and rivulets, or spread out in the temporary lakes
 which were formed at all levels, and may have given rise in many
 instances to sand and gravel terraces of variable extent.           But though
 true beaches are formed in certain            glacial   lakes,  for ledges or
 shelves, such as constitute the Parallel Roads to be formed, a number
 of conditions must have concurred—such         as sufficient slopes, a detrital
 covering, barriers at the mouth of the glens, and cols of escape at their
 upper end.
    As the barrier ridges on the old ice-sheet melted, or burst, the
 waters escaped to lower levels, carrying with them on or beneath
 the ice, a large portion of the surface detritus.        Formed at all levels
 up to 2,000 feet or more, these glacial lake waters in descending to
 lower levels met with other large bodies of water, and the transporting
 forces increased in power till the last stage was reached and open
 channels formed in the distant plains, leaving as marks of their
 passage down the valleys—here great banks of gravel—there deep
 beds of sand, according to the distance from the point of outburst. To
 these floods, combined with river inundations and the modifications
 since brought about by fluviatile action, are due the various forms of
 escars, terraces, and other less defined detrital accumulations.
                                  Conclusions.
    The general conclusions drawn by the author from the phenomena
in Lochaber and surrounding district, are:—
    1st. That at the period of the first great glaciation of Scotland,
the ice-sheet in Lochaber attained a thickness of not less than 2,000
to 2,500 feet, but that in consequence of the peculiar physiographical
conditions of the district, the large ice-currents from Ben Nevis so
clashed with others in the Spean and Lochy Valleys, that a block
                                                                   C  2

ensued which led to an exceptional      heaping up and accumulation of
the ice in front of Glen Roy and Glen Gluoy.
   2nd. In consequence of the lowering and partial submergence of
the land and its conversion.from a continental area to an archipelago,
combined possibly with some other more general cause, an ameliora
tion of the climate took place attended by a gradual melting of the
ice-sheet in all the lower tracts. The snow and ice wasted from the
valleys and from the lower mountain summits, and in the absence of
 any established water-courses, the hollows and depressions in the ice,
when not fissured, were converted into pools and tarns, until the con
tinued liquefaction opened out surface channels or interior fissures,
by which the water could ultimately escape.
    3rd. That pending the establishment of natural lines of drainage,
and in presence at places of unusual obstruction, the water accu
mulated in some valleys in larger bodies or lakes; and if in those
 cases, the mouth of the valleys being closed by the main ice-barriers,
other channels of escape such as cols or passes communicating with
adjacent glens or valleys presented themselves, the water overflowed
 through these channels as soon as it rose to the height of such cols or .
 passes.   Or should the cols have been also barred by ice, that ice
 would have given way as soon as the increasing height and pressure
 of the water proved sufficient. When this happened, the water would
 at once fall to the fixed level regulated by the col, and thus no record,
such as we have in Lochaber, might be left of the presence of the
original bodies of water.
    4th. In the Lochaber district, while the exceptional accumulation
of ice in the Spean Walley barred the entrance of the glens on the
 north side of that valley, their passes were also blocked by remnants
 of the great ice-sheet; and the formation of the detrital shelves is due
 to the sudden bursting of these minor barriers, when the waters of the
 lake were discharged with great rapidity, until they fell to the level
of the col. Under these circumstances, the mass of loose débris
 covering the hill sides below the line of water level, gave way and
 slid after the retreating waters, until stayed with greater or lesser
abruptness, according to the angle of slope and the volume of the
 mass, on the discharge ceasing and the waters coming to rest.        The
 shelves so formed, modified slightly by subsequent subaërial action,
 constitute the “roads.”
    5th. The moraine detritus in places where the glaciers clashed, and
 where their progress consequently became checked or delayed, tended
 also to accumulate or heap up, and in this way in the Lochaber glens
 added to the strength and permanence of the ice-barriers.
    6th. While the moraine detritus was irregularly distributed under
 the ice, or massed in particular places, the débris projected on the
 surface of the ice-stream and contained in its body, was either left in

situ on   its liquefaction, or else was, as the result of the great floods
consequent upon the bursting of lake barriers, carried successively to
lower levels, leaving here and there banks of sand and gravel at
various heights on the hill sides.       These destructive floods combined
with the incessant river inundations due to the same general thaw of
the great ice-sheet, carried      down and spread out in the valleys and
plains the great beds of gravel and sand, which, with the modifications
since brought about by long continued fluviatile action, have given
rise to various forms of escars, terraces, and other less defined
                                                                     -

I. “On      the Sensitive State of Electrical Discharges through
       Rarefied Gases.”         By WILLIAM SPOTTISWOODE, P.R.S., and
       S. FLETCHER MOULTON, late Fellow of Christ's College,
       Cambridge.        Received April 2, 1879.
                                    (Abstract.)
   It   has frequently been remarked that the luminous column pro
duced by electric discharges in vacuum tubes sometimes displays great
sensitiveness on the approach of the finger, or other conductor, to the
tube. This is notably the case when with an induction coil a very
rapid break is used, or when with any constant source of electricity
an air-spark is interposed in the circuit leading to the tube. The
striking character of the phenomena, and the opportunity which they
showed for affecting the discharge from the outside during its passage,
led the authors of this paper to consider that a special examination of
this sensitive state would be desirable.
   All   the circumstances under which sensitiveness is produced appear
to agree in requiring, first, that there should be a rapid intermittence
in the current leading to the tube; and secondly, that the individual
intermittent discharges should be small in quantity and extremely
brief, if not instantaneous, in duration.       Both these requirements are

   If a conductor be made to approach a tube conveying a sensitive
discharge, due to an air-spark in the positive branch of the circuit,
a series of effects is produced, of which the feeblest and the
strongest are the most pronounced.          The transition from one to
the other is so rapid that the intermediate phases may be easily over
looked. In the first case, the luminous column is repelled by the con
ductor; in the second it is broken into two parts which stretch out in
two tongues towards the point on the tube nearest the conductor,
while a negative halo appears between them.

   The effects above described need not be confined to a single patch
or ring of conducting material placed upon the tube; but they may
be produced many times over        in the same tube by a series of rings
arranged at suitable distances.       By this means the column may be
broken into a series of  sections,  all terminating with well-defined con
figurations towards the negative end, and having greater or less
length, according to the position of the rings. In the paper itself,
arguments are there brought forward showing that these sectional
discharges represent striae not merely in their appearance, but also
in their function and structure. But the discussion could hardly be
produced within the limits of an abstract.
   Returning from the digression about striae, the authors next give
evidence, derived mainly from the revolving mirror, and from the
discharges of a partially charged Leyden jar, for the following con
clusion: That the passage of the discharge occupies a time sufficiently
short in comparison with the interval between the discharges to
prevent any interference between successive pulses. Certain experi
ments are then described which indicate that the discharge is effected,
under ordinary circumstances, by the passage through the tube from the
air-spark terminal of free electricity, of the same name as the
electricity at that terminal. In the case of an induction coil, where
the air-spark must be considered as existing at both terminals, there
is evidence of a neutral zone, where the sensitiveness disappears. The
position of this zone may be altered by damping the impulses at either
terminal; or it may be abolished by connecting one terminal with
earth.     The impulses may even be so distributed as to divide
electrically a single tube into three sections, the two extremes pre
senting visible discharges, with a dark section between them.
   Looking at all these phenomena from an opposite point of view,
we may, by means of the relief effects, determine the terminal from
which a discharge proceeds, and the distance to which it reaches
without provoking a response from the other.           And through these
considerations, together with others detailed in the paper, the authors
are led to the conclusion that the discharges at the two terminals of a
tube are in the main independent, and that they are each determined
primarily by the conditions at their own terminal, and only in a
secondary degree by those at the opposite terminal.
   In illustration of this view, an account is then given of the pro
duction of unipolar, positive, or negative discharges in a tube. In
such cases, the discharge being insufficient of itself to pass through
the tube, returns by the way by which it entered.
   This closes a series of experiments, the result of which is that the
discharges from the two terminals can be made of equal intensity, or
of any required degree of inequality; or the discharge can be made
to issue from one terminal only, the other acting only receptively; or

it   can be made to return into                   its own terminal, while the other takes
no part in the discharge; or, finally, the two terminals can be made
to pour out independent discharges of the same name, each of which
returns to its own terminal.
   Having traced the relation between the two parts of the dis
charge, and having found means for controlling their range and
influence, the authors were led to inquire whether there be any
experimental evidence of the state of the tube during the occurrence
of the discharge. Some experiments with two pieces of tinfoil of
unequal size placed near the ends of the tube and metallically con
nected; and others with a strip of tinfoil placed along the tube, all
gave effects showing that the discharge cannot be simultaneous
throughout the tube.      The phenomena appear to require for their
interpretation that, in front of the pulse coming from the (positive)
air-spark terminal, there                  is,
                               during the interval between the pulses,

 1879.]      Mr. C. Tomlinson on     the  Action  of Solid Nuclei.       25
    Some eminent observers have denied the accuracy of these state
ments.      Thus, M. Viollette concludes from his experiments that
porous bodies, such as pumice, calcined baryta, lime, and gypsum, and
bodies greedy of water, and capable of being hydrated, such as cal
cined sulphate of iron and of copper, have no influence on supersatu
rated solutions.
    This observer, believing, as he did, that the only nucleus is a salt of
the same kind as that in solution, or one isomeric therewith, and that
 such nuclei are generally floating in the atmosphere, so ingeniously
arranged his apparatus as to exclude the action of the air, and hence
his results were of a negative character.
    Mr. Liversidge (“Proceedings,” vol. xx), actuated by the same
idea, conducted his experiments on a similar principle, namely, that
of excluding the air, and he also arrived at negative results. He
employed several solid dehydrating substances, such as freshly ignited
quicklime, and placed them in thin glass bulbs, which, being sealed,
were heated nearly to redness, and dropped into the supersaturated
solutions.     The flasks were plugged with cotton wool, through which
a  glass rod was passed, and were then boiled up and allowed to cool
during some hours; when quite cold, the bulb was broken by means
of the glass rod, and its contents were set free, but in no case with any
result.     He also found by his mode of experimenting that porous
bodies and absolute alcohol are inactive.
    In the “Proceedings” vol. xxvii, p. 122, some account is given by
me of a series of observations, extending over several months, on the
action of essential oils on a supersaturated solution of sodic sulphate.
It was found that when the wind at Highgate was in a southerly or
westerly quarter, the oils were inactive; but that they quickly became
active when the wind was northerly or easterly.
   A similar course of observations, though not extending over so
long a time, has led to a similar conclusion respecting solid porous,
and dehydrating bodies.
    The solutions chiefly employed in the experiments that led me to
this conclusion were those of sodic sulphate, sodic acetate, and alum,
of various degrees of supersaturation.           The solid nuclei employed
were    chiefly pumice   and plaster   of Paris;  but others were also used,
such as     meerschaum,    marble,   lime from marble and chalk, coke,
charcoal, and bread.                               -
    The flasks containing the solutions were sometimes carried into the
open air of my garden before being uncovered. The plaster of Paris
was taken out of a bottle by means of a small, clean, platinum spoon,
and a fragment of pumice, about the size of a pea, was taken up with
forceps, and thus dropped into the solution, the cover being imme
diately restored to the flask.
   The active solid nuclei could be immediately rendered inactive by

26        Mr. C. Tomlinson   on the Action of Solid Nuclei.     [May 8,
exposing them for a short time to the heat of the kitchen oven or to
the flame of a spirit lamp, or even to the temperature of boiling water.
For this last purpose a test-tube was thrust through a flat cork, rest
ing on the mouth of a large flask containing water, which was kept
bciling. The bottom of the tube containing the plaster, &c., did not
pass beyond the centre of the flask.     In about ten minutes the nuclei
were thus rendered inactive, and they did not recover their activity
in atmospheres of carbonic acid, nitrogen, hydrogen, and nitrous
oxide, after several days or even weeks. But they frequently became
active in oxygen, and generally so in oxygen or air ozonised by the
action of phosphorus, and always so by a short exposure to the outer
air, when the wind was northerly or easterly. Inactive plaster of
Paris has been exposed all night to the air of my garden during
a south-west wind, without becoming active. Fragments of pumice ex
posed to the air of my laboratory for days together, without becoming
active, have regained their activity within ten minutes on being
exposed to the open air during a northerly wind.         Snow was also
found to be active.
    The details of a few experiments may not here be out of place.
The wind at Highgate, from the 28th March to the 8th April, was
southerly and westerly.     During all this time some plaster of Paris,
 rendered inactive by heat, was freely exposed on a flat glass plate
 to the open air of my garden, and remained inactive.       On the 9th
the wind passed round to the east, and remained so during some hours,
gently blowing; the plaster became active on solutions of sodic sul
phate and sodic acetate.
    Fragments of pumice, meerschaum, and coke, rendered inactive by
the heat of the oven, were put into carbonic acid on the 28th March,
where they remained until the 9th April, when they were still found
to be inactive on solutions of sodic sulphate. They were exposed
to the air of my garden, and became active in rather more than two
hours.
    A similar result was obtained with inactive fragments that had been
kept in nitrous oxide.
    Mr. Grenfell (“Chemical News,” xxxix, 16) is of opinion that the
action of nuclei in bringing about the solidification of these solutions
is entirely due to absorption. In one of his ingenious experiments,
filtering paper, folded a number of times into a long spill, is passed
down the neck of the flask so as to touch the solution, the effect being
to render it solid either at once or after some time.
    I repeated this experiment, with this modification, namely, that of
placing the spills in the kitchen oven for about a quarter of an hour;
they were then passed down the narrow necks of some flasks which
they fitted with friction, and the ends were made to dip just below the
 surface of a solution of sodic acetate (3 to 1). One of the flasks was

     1879.]     Mr. C. Tomlinson on      the  Action of Solid Nuclei.          27
    immediately covered      with a jar of nitrogen and the other with a jar of
    air.   After three days the solutions were still liquid. The spills were
    then removed,      and fresh ones, not previously heated, were introduced,
    when one solution immediately became solid, and the other some time
    after.
       If  the  filtering paper, pumice, plaster, &c.,     acted  by absorption,
    then the effect of heat would be to increase the absorptive power, and
   consequently their activity as nuclei; whereas the contrary result
   is obtained, so that absorption does not seem to be a vera causa.
       When    it is stated that the nuclei  became active on being exposed to
   certain winds in preference to others, the locality in which the experi
   ments were conducted must be taken into account; for, as Professor
   Stokes suggested at the reading of my former paper, a westerly or
   southerly wind might be equally active in another place.         I found this
   to be the case      at Eastbourne, where   a westerly wind produced, in the
  course     of ten minutes,   a deep orange-brown    stain on ozone test-paper,
  and made the oils singularly active after a few minutes’ exposure. For
  example, on the 10th of June oil of lemons was inactive in the house,
  but on being exposed to a strong south-west wind from the sea, about
  a mile away from the town, it became viscid in the course of a few
  minutes' exposure, so that it dropped very slowly.            The solutions, on
  contact with this oil, immediately became solid. On the 11th, a
  limpid paraffin oil, on being redistilled, was inactive within doors.         It
  was taken to the end of the pier, 1,012 feet from the shore, and
 exposed in drops to a strong westerly wind for about three minutes,
 when it became powerfully active. On the 13th there was scarcely
 any     wind, but what there was was west south-west. Freshly dis
 tilled oil of cajuput was inactive within doors, but, on being exposed
 to the outer air for about fifteen minutes, it became active.
      In July, at Bournemouth, the weather was sultry; ozone test-paper
 was scarcely acted on, even after an exposure of some hours, and
 inactive oils did not become active under the influence of the air.
      In September, at Denchworth, near Wantage,           ozone  was abundant,
judging from its action on test-paper. Some inactive turpentine oils
thickened on being exposed to the air (wind north and south-east),
and the effect on the solutions was decisive.
      Before concluding I must refer to the nuclear action of alcohol. In
order to test this once more, a day was selected when the wind was in
the east, when rain had fallen during some hours, and continued to
fall all the time the experiments were being conducted in the open
air of my garden. About ten flasks of sodic sulphate (3 to 1), and
about the same number of potash alum (4 to 3) were prepared. In
filling the belly of the flasks about half full, a small funnel with a long
stem was used, and was dipped into warm water after each filling, so
as not to soil the necks of the flasks; and in reboiling, each flask was

placed at an angle of about 45°, so that if any spitting occurred it
would be against the belly of the flask and not into the neck. The
necks were covered with small beakers, taken out of water, and the
flasks were thus conveyed to the outer air and left to cool, the tem
perature being 40°.    When cold, some absolute alcohol in a small
clean beaker was taken up by means of a clean dropping tube, and a
single drop or a number of drops was delivered to the surface of each
solution without contact with the interior of the neck, the covering
beaker, in each case, being lifted a little on one side so as not com
pletely to uncover the mouth of the flask or admit the rain. The
sodic sulphate solution in several cases became solid directly the
alcohol reached it; in other cases after some minutes; in two flasks
the alcohol acted by determining a copious deposit of the modified
salt,” but the solution in one of them became solid on gently shaking                                                       it,

observed at various stations round the harbour of Godhavn, showed
considerable differences, evidently caused by local magnetic dis
turbance.
   Proceeding northward to winter quarters a few results in declina
tion were obtained at intermediate stations.
   On the 1st September, 1875, the “Alert” reached her winter
quarters at Floeberg Beach, latitude 82° 27' N., longitude 61° 22' W.
The magnetic observatory, constructed entirely of snow, was situated
at a distance of 200 yards from the ship. It was divided into three
distinct houses 27 feet apart, and in these the horizontal force mag
netometer, Barrow's dip-circle, and the differential declination mag
netometer were secured to snow pedestals. As no stove was used the
range of the thermometer registered was from -10° to +4°.
   Here the series of observations, the results of which are given in
the following pages, were made during the winter.                                             The      mean values
of the several elements obtained                   are:

   In his sledging journey to the extreme northerly position attained
in the expedition (lat. 83° 20' 26" N.), Commander Markham made
observations of the declination, and with the Fox circle.
   The “Discovery” took up winter quarters at Discovery Bay, 53
miles S.W. of the “Alert,” in latitude 81° 44' N, longitude 65° 3' W.,
on the 26th August, 1875.                                 -
   The magnetic observatory house                       was constructed of wood, and stood
on the shore 197      yards     from the           ship,      and the pedestals formed of the
ship's binnacles sunk into the ground were found to be very firm.
For the differential declination magnetometer an ice-house was built
on the ice-floe 90 yards from the ship, the magnetometer being frozen
on to a pedestal of ice. The mean value of the several elements ob
served at this station are:—

   One of the chief subjects of interest in the magnetical results of the
observations at the winter quarters observatories is that of the diurnal
variation or inequality of the declination, and frequent magnetic dis
turbances, the latter especially, as the ships wintered in a region

  remarkable, as it proved, for an absence of brilliant auroras, and in
  which no connexion was observed between the appearances of that
  phenomenon and movements of the declinometer magnet.
    Hourly observations were made with the differential declination
  magnetometers, and on all occasions of great disturbance special
  observations at frequent intervals.             At Floeberg Beach continuous
  hourly scale readings were taken during portions of December, 1875,
  and January and February, 1876—in all 37 days; and at Discovery
  Bay from the 23rd October, 1875, to the 28th March, 1876, with only
  a break of two days in November, and a few hours in February.
    The greatest range of the declination was observed on the 19th
  February, 1876, about the same hours, at Floeberg Beach and Dis
  covery Bay, reaching 5°9'4 and 5° 47'-9 respectively.                       The smallest
 range was observed on the 12th January, when only 0°4' was recorded
 at the first-named           station, and 0°6'-9 at     the last. On an average,
 about every eighth day the higher values                of the daily range were
 attained, and comparing the highest with                 the lowest scale reading
 during the whole period, it shows that the              magnet moved over 8° of
 al"C.
    The    mean    daily ranges for the several months or the square root of
 the mean of the squares of the daily ranges for each month expressed
 in arc,   are:

    At Discovery Bay, therefore, the mean daily range gradually de
clined in value from October to December, when the minimum range
was reached, but again increased during the subsequent months of
observation.
    Comparing the results of the mean daily range during the whole
period with those obtained at Floeberg Beach and Van Rensselaer
Harbour *—stations where the inclination and horizontal force differ
so   little from the       same elements at Discovery Bay—it is found that
the mean       daily  range     at Van Rensselaer Harbour was 2°28'6; Floe
berg Beach, 1° 31'5; Discovery Bay, 1°28'0.
    The hours of the greatest easterly and westerly deflection of the
declinometer magnet in its mean daily departure from the normal,
differed considerably from those of the middle northern latitudes,
where 8 A.M. and 1 to 2 P.M. are the well-established hours.

   A separating value of 30' at a station where the absolute horizontal
force is 1:13, and the inclination 84° 50', may be considered sufficient,
when compared with those adopted by Sir Edward Sabine, viz., at
Point Barrow, 22'87, with a horizontal force equal 1.88, and dip

    The general effect, therefore, of disturbance is to accelerate the
 arrival of the magnet at its points of extreme deflection by one hour,
 in addition to producing a much larger range in the diurnal variation.
 Thus, with disturbances included, the range is 35' 6; with their re
 jection  it is only    16'-3 at Discovery Bay.
    The erection of the declinometer houses of both ships on the ice
floe (which rose and fell with the tide), renders the observed motions
of the magnet open to the suspicion of disturbances other than those
produced by magnetical causes.
    Chiefly for this reason no further analysis has been made of the
disturbances at Floeberg Beach.
    In  the case of the “Discovery,” comparisons were made between
the declinometer on the floe and the unifilar magnetometer on shore
during times of disturbances, and the magnets moved alike, with two
exceptions.       On February 2nd, the magnet on shore was much dis
turbed, that on the ice very steady; at midnight of February 28th,
the reverse took place, the declinometer being disturbed in a peculiar
manner, whilst the unifilar magnetometer remained nearly steady.

   At the first-named place the disturbing force was greatest during

   Another result which also deserves attention       that of the mean                is
maximum disturbance about noon, being preceded and followed by
smaller values. This     in accordance with the results obtained at

yet remains                  to    be
                     seen what was the direction        the disturbances              of

                                                      of
show that the easterly disturbances prevail over the westerly during

of  the day the westerly  disturbances predominate.
   Taking the difference between the mean easterly and mean westerly
disturbances,      found that the easterly disturbance

  +8.5 and +11:2.
       Among the peculiarities of the disturbances at Discovery Bay, are
 two which    exhibit their semi-American, semi-Asiatic character.
       At Pekin, Nertschinsk, and Discovery Bay the aggregate values of
 the westerly deflections decidedly predominate,       the contrary obtains
  in America.    In North America “the conical form (of the curves)
  characterizes the easterly deflections.” The same occurs at Discovery
  Bay, but the double maximum—which           is observed in the easterly
  deflections at Pekin and Nertschinsk, and the westerly in North
  America—is common to both easterly and westerly deflections.
    Objections may possibly be raised to a comparison being made
  between the observations of a few months with those of as many
 years. The period of observation, however, includes one solstice and
 the subsequent equinox; it
                                              in is,
                                  therefore, considered that according
 Mr. Broun's investigations       high latitudes, all the broad features                                                of to
 the disturbances have been rendered prominent.
    Before concluding this analysis, the question            how far the                     of
 observed and assumed days        disturbance of  Discovery Bay coincided    at
 with those      Kew Observatory seems worthy

greatest decrease in the declination;         and at 6.50 p.m.    it was 12' to
the eastward of the normal.
   Finally, it may be stated that the comparison of the disturbances
at Kew and the two winter quarters observatories of the Arctic Expe
dition, 1875–76, appear to confirm Gauss's conclusion, that “the
synchronous disturbances of the same element not only differ widely
in amount, but occasionally appear to be even reversed in direction.”
                                    Auroras.
    The appearances of auroras and the synchronous movements of the
declinometer magnet, were subjects of special observation during the
stay of the “Alert” and “Discovery" at their winter quarters. On
all occasions they were observed to be faint, with none of those
brilliant manifestations which are described by our own officers as
seen at Point Barrow,” and by the Austro-Hungarian                Expedition in
 Franz Josef Land,t where the magnetical instruments were so sensibly
 disturbed.
    These phenomena were not observed either in the “Alert” or
 “Discovery,” especially no connexion between magnetical disturbances -
 and the appearances of auroras could be traced.
    This is quite in accordance with the remarks of previous observers
 within the region comprehended between the meridians of 60° and
 90° W., and north of the parallel of 73° N.              For examples, see the
 remarks of    Captain   Parry  and Lieutenant Foster in the discussion of
 their magnetical observations at Port Bowen, in the “Phil. Trans,”
 1826, Part IV, page 76. Also Mr. A. Schott's discussion of Dr. Kane's
 observations at Van Rensselaer Harbour, “Smithsonian Contributions,”
 vol. x, 1858.
    The following description of the aurora observed on 21st November,
 1875, is given by Commander Markham and Lieutenant Giffard in
 their abstract of observations at Floeberg Beach:—
     “Between 10 and 11 p.m. bright broad streamers of the aurora
 appeared 10° or 15° above the north horizon, stretching through the
 Zenith, and terminating in an irregular curve about 25° above the
 south horizon, bearing S.S.W. During the aurora's greatest brilliancy
 the magnet was observed during five minutes to be undisturbed.”
     The aurora was visible on 49 days between the 22nd October, 1875,
  and the 27th February, 1876.
     The observations from which the foregoing magnetical results have
  been obtained were made by Commander (now Captain) A. H. Mark
  ham and Lieutenant G. A. Giffard, of the “Alert,” Lieutenants R.
  H. Archer and R. B. Fulford, of the “Discovery.”

     In this paper the author draws attention to the long series of mag
netical observations which have been made at the Royal Observatory,
under the direction of Sir George B. Airy, K.C.B., Astronomer Royal.
Commencing in the year 1841, the observations for a few years con
sisted of eye readings of the various instruments, made every two
hours; since the year 1848 the motions of the magnets have been
registered by photography, according to a plan arranged by Mr.
Charles Brooke.
  Attention is briefly drawn to the question of magnetic variations,
and to the circumstance    that examination of the Greenwich records
shows that, in addition to the ordinary diurnal and annual changes,
there appears to exist, in the magnetic diurnal ranges, an inequality of
marked character, and of longer period, resembling in               its
                                                                features the
well-established  eleven-year   sun-spot    period.
 It    is remarked that this        not, by any means, the first time that
                                     is
such relation has been discussed,            being, by some investigators,

                      be      sufficiently   well proved. But      appeared
                                                                        it

                                                                   of
relation.   For (as regards the results actually employed) the observa
tions have been throughout made            the same general plan, and with
                                               on
the same instruments.       The conclusion arrived at should therefore
be   one   worthy     of   some confidence.
  The results for declination and horizontal force only are                  used,
because,  the vertical force instrument having been more than once
changed, the strict continuity    the record by the latter instrument
                                          of                                      is

tively  to is
          other months. Two series       numbers are thus formed, each
                                                of
series being  treated  independently.   Days      unusual magnetic dis
                                                         of
turbance are omitted.
  Before the numbers can             be   compared with sun-spot numbers,    it   is

44            Mr. Ellis   on the Relation between Magnetic               [May 8,
necessary, in order to estimate progressive change, to treat them
in some way that will eliminate the actual annual inequality.    This is
done, both for declination and horizontal force, by taking the mean of
each twelve consecutive monthly values, and again the mean of each
two consecutive values, giving a series of annual or smoothed means,
the mean epochs of which differ by one month.
   In the forty-third volume of the “Memoirs of the Royal Astro
nomical Society,” Dr. Rudolf Wolf, of Zürich, gives a table of relative
solar spot values, found by treating actual monthly numbers (for the
purpose of removing accidental irregularities),    exactly in the same
way in which the monthly magnetic numbers were treated.
   The magnetic numbers and Dr. Wolf's sun-spot numbers are thus
strictly comparative, and from these numbers curves are drawn which
show a remarkable similarity.    Not only do the epochs of minimum
and maximum     accord, but smaller changes are also seen to appear in
all three curves.
  The epochs of minimum and maximum being tabulated, it is found
that, on the average, the mean magnetic epoch follows the sun-spot
epoch by 0:27 of a year. By another method of tabulation the differ
ence becomes reduced to 0.10 of a year.    Some other interesting
details are here added.
  The    general circumstance that the diurnal ranges of magnetic
elements are subject to an eleven-year period, similar to that of
sun-spots, being considered to be satisfactorily established, it seemed
desirable to ascertain whether the more fitful changes of the pheno
mena in any way also correspond.      In order to make this comparison,
the magnetic   numbers,  instead of being smoothed, as before described,
were now cleared only of the average annual inequality, and compared
with the actual monthly sun-spot numbers (not the smoothed num
bers as before). Curves are given, founded on these numbers, and
they show some very remarkable correspondences between the more
rapid sun-spot and magnetic variations, especially between the years
1869 and 1873.      It is remarked that the magnetic results appear
to be   sensibly improved   since the instruments were placed (in the
year 1864) in an underground apartment in which the diurnal range
of temperature is less than    1°.
   Further inquiry seems      topoint      to
                                            variation
                                                a        in the annual in
equalities  of magnetic diurnal range. This question           discussed
                                                              is                   in
some detail, and the numbers and diagrams given appear             to
                                                                  show that
such variation   really exists, the inequalities being    increased      the  at
time   of
        a  sun-spot maximum, and diminished         at
                                                    the time        sun-spot

minimum.
   The following are the general conclusions supposed           to      be   derived
from the whole inquiry:
  1.   That the diurnal ranges     of   the magnetic elements   of   declination

1879.]             Declination   and Horizontal Force.                   45
and  horizontal force are subject to a periodical variation, the duration
of which is equal to that of the known eleven-year sun-spot period.
   2. That the epochs of minimum and maximum of magnetic and
sun-spot effect are nearly coincident; the magnetic epochs, on the whole,
occurring somewhat later than the corresponding sun-spot epochs.
The variations of duration in different
                                   -
                                           periods appear to be similar for
both phenomena.
   3. That the occasional more sudden outbursts of magnetic and sun
spot energy, extending sometimes over periods of several months,
appear to occur nearly simultaneously, and progress collaterally.
   4. That it seems probable that the annual inequalities of magnetic
diurnal range are subject also to periodical variation, being increased
at the time of a sun-spot maximum, when the mean diurnal range is
increased, and diminished at the time of a sun-spot minimum, when
the mean diurnal range is diminished.

      April  30, 1879.
   In  my paper of last December"     I called attention to the importance
of  discussing  Young's  observations of the chromospheric lines in con
nexion with the spectra of the metallic elements.            In subsequent
communications     I have given preliminary results of this discussion so
far as it has already proceeded.                                             -
   Since my paper was read Messrs.         Liveing     and Dewar have, in a
paper printed in the last number of the “Proceedings,” given a table
which professes to state the number of times various lines in certain
metals were seen by Young in connexion with certain reversal pheno
mena observed by themselves.
   The statements, however, made in this table with regard to the

 46                     Note    by Mr. Norman Lockyer.                  [May 15,
 visibility of certain lines in the chromosphere do not appear to be in
 accordance with Young's published tables, and as Messrs. Liveing and
 Dewar have in a still later paper drawn theoretical conclusions from
 these statements,     I think it desirable to call attention to the fact, in
 order to prevent any confusion which might otherwise arise.
    It will be sufficient to refer to two cases:—
    I.  Messrs. Liveing and Dewar state that two lines of aluminium,
 the   wave-lengths    of which they give as 6245 and 6237, have each
 been seen   by  Young     eight times.
    According to Thalén's measurements, which are the best that we
 possess, there are no lines of aluminium in these positions.           He gives,
 however, lines at 6244'0 and 6234:0.
    Young, moreover,       states  that he saw reversed a strong line (clearly
 shown in Angström's map to be an iron line) at 6245'4, and a line
 which he does not ascribe to any element at 6237.3, which is more
 than three divisions of the scale from the position of the aluminium
 line.
     II. In the case of potassium, Messrs. Liveing and Dewar give two
 lines at wave-lengths 4044 and 4042 as having been seen by Young
 three times.      I  know of no potassium lines at the places given;
 Young moreover has recorded the reversal of no potassium line in
 this region. What Young distinctly states he saw, was the reversal
 of the iron line at 404.5.0, which is one of the most marked iron lines
                                                         I
 in the spectrum of the sun. To this reversal referred in my paper of
  December 12th.*
    It is perfectly true that there are two potassium lines in this region;
 they were not mapped by Thalén, and they were only seen as a single
 line by Lecoq de Boisbaudrant and the wave-length, given as 4045, as
 his dispersion was limited, did not enable us to determine its true
 position with reference to the Fraunhofer lines. Last year, however,
 I  not only stated the double nature of this line on photographic evi
 dence, and pointed out that both components were absent from the
                         I
 spectre normal, but gave their wave-lengths as 4042-75 and 4046:28
 (positions which will only find the last place of decimals altered, even
 if it be altered, in the revision of the map now being proceeded with),
 and on the strength of them announced the existence of potassium
 in the sun. Messrs. Liveing and Dewar do not state whence their
•wave-lengths were derived, neither do they refer to my communication.
 It would appear therefore not only that the reference to Young's work
 in many cases is founded upon some misunderstanding, but that a
 higher degree of accuracy than that employed by Messrs. Liveing and
 Dewar is necessary to determine such coincidences.                 I  may state
 generally that my eleven years' work on this special branch has led

 me   to the  conclusion that   ali statements of coincidences between
 metallic and solar lines with a lower degree of accuracy than that
 employed by Thalén and Young are to be avoided when possible as
 they may be worse than useless, they may mislead. Indeed, though
 the map on which      I am working is on twelve tines the scale of
 Angström's, it would be better    if                             I
                                      it were larger; and when say this
 I must add    my tribute of admiration    of the accuracy of the work of
 those who have preceded me, notably Angström, Thalén, Cornu, and
                             I
 Young, with whose work am more familiar, as it is expressed in
 wave-lengths.
 II. * Sur    la Limite Ultraviolette du Spectre Solaire." Par
       Mons. A. CoRNU. Communicated by the PRESIDENT. Re
       ceived May 15, 1879.
    Je  me suis proposé depuis plusieurs années d'obtenir la limite
 extrême du spectre solaire du côté ultraviolet, c'est-à-dire, du côté
 des courtes longueurs d'onde. La connaissance exacte de la limite
 de ce spectre ou plutôt de la loi suivant laquelle décroit l'intensité du
 spectre continu idéal de la photosphère, apporterait sur la difficile ques
tion de la température du soleil des données au moins aussi impor
 tantes que les mesures thermiques, correspondant aux radiations à
 grande longueur d'onde.
    Malheureusement, comme on va le voir, l'atmosphère terrestre exerce
 sur les radiations à courte longueur d'onde une absorption si éner
gique que la majeure partie du spectre solaire ultraviolet est inter
ceptée d'une manière complète ; l'étude que je m'étais proposée est
donc actuellement impossible sous la forme simple que j'avais ima
ginée; néanmoins les résultats obtenus en vue de ces recherches pré
sentent quelque intérêt, même au point de vue auquel je m'étais
primitivement placé; ils jettent, en tous cas, un certain jour sur
l'allure probable de l'absorption atmosphérique à l'autre extrémité du
spectre moins facile à étudier, et montrent que le phénomène thermique
est plus complexe que ne le suppose le mode expérimental générale
ment adopté pour l'évaluation de la température du soleil.
   Pour rester dans le domaine des faits et de leurs conséquences les
plus immédiates, je me bornerai ici à donner un résumé succinct des
expériences à l'aide des quelles j'ai cherché à obtenir photographique
ment la limite extrême ultraviolette du spectre solaire et l'analyse des
conditions qui permettraient de reculer un peu cette limite.
                           Mode d'Observation.
   Le spectroscope dont je me sers généralement est composé d'un
collimateur   et d'une lunette, dont les objectifs sont respectivement

  formés par une lentille plan convexe de quartz (d'environ 0"26 de
  longueur focale pour la raie D); le prisme est en Spath d'Islande ;
  on utilise le rayon ordinaire dont la dispersion est assez grande.
  Comme les objectifs ne sont pas achromatiques, la mise au point
 est variable avec la refrangibilité des rayons         ;  une table construite
 expérimentalement donne les variations de tirage de la lunette et du
 collimateur pour l'observation des rayons de chaque refrangibilité.
     Quoique le Spath d'Islande ne soit pas aussi transparent que le
 quartz, néanmoins, pour l'observation du spectre solaire, l'appareil est
 parfaitement convenable, car l'absorption par le Spath d'Islande ne
 commence à devenir appréciable que pour les très courtes longueurs
                                                 ;
 d'onde (X=210 millionèmes de millimètre) or les dernières radiations
 solaires qu'on puisse observer n'atteignent pas X=290. Des expé
 riences comparatives faites avec des prismes de quartz et de Spath
 d'Islande en prenant pour source une étincelle d'induction ont montré
 la complète égalité de transparence des deux substances entre les
 limites indiquées ; l'avantage reste toutefois au Spath dont les rayons
 sont plus séparés et plus dispersés.
    Au foyer de la lunette on place une plaque fluorescente de verre
 d'urane pour la vérification approchée des réglages, et finalement une
 petite glace sensibilisée par du collodion humide.               La durée d'ex
 position varie, suivant les besoins, de 23 à 6 minutes, pour obtenir la
 limite extrême du spectre.
    A l'aide d'un héliostat dont le miroir est remplacée par un prisme
reflecteur en quartz on concentre le faisceau du lumière sur la fente
du collimateur à l'aide d'une lentille de quartz. La limite du spectre
est variable suivant l'état de l'atmosphère, la nature du collodion
employé, et la durée d'exposition ; mais en choisissant les plus belles

   1879]          Sur la Limite Ultraviolette du Spectre Solaire.                 49
      Remarque.-Les raies d'absorption dans l'orangé, voisines de la raie
  D, sont notablement plus faibles que de coutume.
      La limite du spectre est exprimée en longueur d'onde, par com
   paraison avec la carte que j'ai construite d'après les observations faites
   pendant l'été de 1877.
      On voit que l'étendue du spectre diminue avec la hauteur du soleil,
   ce qui tend à prouver que c'est à l'absorption de l'atmosphère qu'est
   dûe cette limitation.
      Après divers essais faits d'après cette manière de voir, j'ai été con
   duit à représenter par la courbe suivante les résultats des observations ;
   on porte comme abscisse la longueur d'onde, limite observée, et
   comme ordonnée le logarithme du sinus de la hauteur du soleil (on sait
   que les épaisseurs atmosphériques traversées par les rayons solaires
   sont sensiblement en raison inverse du sinus de la hauteur du soleil).
   L'ensemble des points ainsi définis se trouvent pour une même journée
  répartis sur une courbe à fort peu près rectiligne, les variations corres
  pondant à des altérations momentanées de la transparence de l'atmo
  sphère. Dans les belles journées les limites du spectre sont sensiblement
  les mêmes pour les mêmes hauteurs du soleil.                     Dans les journées
  légèrement brumeuses les limites observées sont un peu moins éten
  dues, de sorte que le défaut de transparence se traduit par un déplace
  ment de la ligne parallèlement à elle-même. La transparence de l'atmo
   sphère pour les radiations ultraviolettes parait augmenter au mois de
  Septembre et Octobre, et se continuer même en hiver en Décembre et
  Janvier; malheureusement les belles journées sont rares en hiver, et
  il  est difficile de décider si cette augmentation de transparence est
  spéciale aux temps froids, ou si elle provient de ce qu'on ne choisit, en
  hiver, que les journées où le ciel présente la transparence maximum.
     La construction de plus d'une centaine d'observations aux diverses
 heures de la journée m'a conduit        à   adopter comme ligne moyenne la
 droite qui passe par le point
                                     sin h=       0 49,

                   sin h=     075,                    sin  h=     0,30,

 (relevés sur un courbe dont les ordonnées représentaient les sinus des
hauteurs vraies du soleil au debut de l'observation).                  On en déduit
l'équation empirique
                           sin  h=049 10-0086175(x-300),

    La limite la plus éloignée que j'ai pu obtenir correspond à la
longueur d'onde 293; elle a été atteinte avec certitude deux fois
seulement, le 24 Juin et le 18 Août 1878, aux environs de midi.
 Les radiations X =294 à 295 ont été atteinte bien des fois de Mai à
 Septembre, 1877 et 1878, et récemment le 5 Mai 1879
    Malgré les nombreux essais faits dans les meilleures conditions soit
à  Paris,                           il
           soit à la campagne, m'a été impossible d'aller plus loin.
                          Examen des Causes d'Erreurs.
               :
    Cette recherche d'une limite de visibilité comporte évidemment, à
 un point de vue absolu, bien des causes d'erreurs, dont les deux prin
cipales sont
   1°. Les inégalités de transparence de l'atmosphère ;
   2°. L'inégalité des effets photographiques provenant de la sensibilité
spécifique du collodion employé et de la durée de l'exposition.
     1°. Inégalité de Transparence de l'Atmosphère.-Cette cause d'erreur
étant inévitable, on ne peut en atténuer les effets que par une longue
série d'observations ;      il  est à remarquer que si l'on prend soin de
choisir des    jours   sans   nuage    ni brume, les inégalités se réduisent à
bien peu de chose, et sont de l'ordre des erreurs que les accidents de la
manipulation photographique peuvent introduire.
   2°. Inégalité des Effets Photographiques.-La seconde cause d'erreur
est, au point de vue pratique, bien moins grave qu'on ne pourrait le
supposer au premier abord par suite de diverses circonstances que je
vais brièvement rapporter.
   Les collodions humides de composition diverses (iodures et bromures
de cadmium et d'ammonium) ne paraissent différer que fort peu rela
tivement à l'action qu'ils éprouvent sous l'influence des radiations très
réfrangibles, en ce sens, qu'ils ne presentent pas de maximum ou de
minimum pour certaines radiations,* c'est ce qu'on peut constater en
photographiant des spectres d'étincelles d'induction            ;  ces intensités
relatives des raies conservent la même valeur, même bien au-delà de la
région des radiations extrêmes observées dans le spectre solaire. La
sensibilité plus ou moins grande se traduit seulement par la durée du
temps d'exposition nécessaire pour obtenir le même effet photogra
phique, c'est-à-dire, la même intensité du cliché.
    Il ne reste donc que l'influence de la durée d'exposition qui puisse
introduire des causes d'erreurs dans l'appreciation de la limite du
spectre; or     il se présente une circonstance extremement favorable,
c'est   que  l'effet photographique se produit pour ainsi dire dans les
première instants, de sorte que la prolongation de l'exposition n'ajoute
que peu à l'étendue des radiations agissantes. C'est ce que j'ai établi
   * Dans le spectre visible il n'en est pas de même notamment dans le voisinage de
la raie G.

dépasser 2 à 3 minutes pour la durée de l'exposition lorsque le temps

    Ainsi on recule la limite de visibilité des radiations d'une quantité
 correspondant à une unité (millionème de millimètre) dans la longueur
 d'onde lorsqu'on s'éleve 663'3 en altitude.
    Ce gain est, relativement à la longueur du spectre que donnent les
 étincelles d'induction ou l'arc electrique, extrémement faible. Si l'on
 songe que l'on ne peut qu'en faire d'observations régulières au dessus
 de 4000 mètres d'altitude, on voit que le gain calculé n'atteint que
 6 unités ou environ la moitié de la différence qui se presente de l'hiver
 à l'été, le résultat obtenu serait donc encore bien loin de correspondre
 aux efforts à dépenser pour aller installer des appareils à une altitude
 aussi grande.
    Il  est vrai que l'on aurait quelque espoir d'aller un peu plus loin
que la formule ne l'indique, car les co-efficients numeriques sont em
pruntés à des experiences faites à de faibles altitudes (au dessous de
200*), c'est-à-dire dans les parties basses de l'atmosphère dont le pou
voir de transmission spécifique est probablement plus faible que celui
des hautes regions à cause des brumes et poussières qui sont toujours
en suspension.
    On pourrait aussi espérer que la formule empirique fondée sur
l'observation d'une très petite étendue du spectre, et employée ici
par extrapolation, ne donne des résultats erronés dans un sens défavor
able en dehors des limites où elle à été établie; quoi qu'il soit impos

sible de rien affirmer avec certitude sous ce rapport, n'est pas sans
intérêt de signaler un fait qui parait donner une grande probabilité
sinon à la valeur exacte des coefficients du moins à l'allure de la loi
empirique proposée.
    En effet, poussons l'extrapolation à l'extrême et cherchons, puisque
le pouvoir absorbant de l'atmosphère parait grandir d'une manière
aussi rapide avec la refrangibilité des radiations, quelle est la longueur
d'onde de la radiation (ayant une intensité comparable à la radiation
correspondante du soleil)       qui donnerait la limite d'impression photo

  donc la limite possible d'étendue des spectres observables au spectro

  et les appareils.
     Nous prendrons la formule (2) sous la forme

 le rapport   , represente le rapport    de épaisseurs réduites ou le rapport
 des pressions      correspondant  à  ces épaisseurs : on   peut adopter ici
    -        puisque l'élévation de  lm correspond à peu près à un dixième

 mission étant normale et l'on aura a résoudre l'equation numerique

 on trouve M= 1842
     Comme on a pris un peu arbitrairement        l  metre on pourrait croire
 qu'en choisissant une autre valeur la limite changerait beaucoup;          il
 n'en est rien la limite change extremement peu, car en diminuant l'épais
 seur traversée l, de moitie on trouve X= 173, la longueur reduite d'un
 spectroscope est evidemment comprise entre ces limites.
     Or lorsqu'on examine un spectroscope construit tout en quartz ou
 tout en Spath fluor, par fluorescence, ou par photographie, les spectres
 des étincelles d'induction, en leur donnant toute l'energie que donnent
 une forte pile et une bobine de grande dimension, on n'arrive guère à
 depasser la réfrangibilité de la raie No. 32 de l'aluminium dont la
 longueur d'onde est 184 environ, ainsi que je      l'ai mesurée directement
 à l'aide d'un réseau.
    Je me suis assuré en outre qu'en plaçant l'etincelle à 4 mètres de
l'appareil, dans des circonstances telles que l'éclat des raies moins
réfrangibles No. 30 et No. 31 (notations de M. Soret) soit à peine
diminué, la raie 32 disparait. On ne peut donc guère attribuer ce fait
qu'à l'absorption atmosphèrique.
    Donc la formule empirique déterminée plus haut, ne doit pas être
très erronée lorsqu'on l'emploie par extrapolation dans le voisinage des
limites où elle a été établie ; par conséquent les chances d'extension de
nos connaissances sur la partie ultraviolette du spectre solaire avec
l'altitude au de là de ce qu'indique cette formule ne sont pas très
considérables.

 III. “On      an Induction-Currents Balance, and Experimental Re
        searches made therewith.”               By Professor D. E. HUGHES.
        Communicated by Professor HUXLEY, Sec. R.S. Received
        May 5, 1879.
     Immediately upon the announcement of Arago's discovery of the
 influence of rotating plates of metal upon a magnetic needle (1824),
 and Faraday's important discovery of voltaic and magneto-induction
 (1831), it became evident that the induced currents, circulating in a
 metallic mass, might be so, acted upon either by voltaic or induced
 currents as to bring some new light to bear on the molecular construc
 tion of metallic bodies.
     The question was particularly studied by Babbage, Sir John Herschel,
 and by M. Dove" who constructed an induction balance, wherein
 two separate induction coils, each having its primary and secondary
 coils, were joined together in such a manner that the induced current
 in one coil was made to neutralize the induced current in the opposite
 coil, thus forming an induction balance, to which he gave the name
 of differential inductor. In those days physicists did not possess the
 exquisitely sensitive galvanometers and other means of research that,
 we possess at the present day, but sufficiently important results were
 obtained to prove that a vast field of research would be opened if a.
 perfect induction balance could be found, together with a means of
 correctly estimating the results obtained. In experimenting with the
 microphone     I  had ample occasion to appreciate the exquisite sensitive
 ness   of the   telephone   to minute induced currents. This led me to
 study the question of induction by aid of the telephone and micro
phone. The results of those researches have been already published.t
    Continuing this line of inquiry, thought I              I might again attempt
 to   investigate    the molecular construction of metals and alloys, and
                      I
 with this object have obtained, after numerous comparative failures,
a perfect induction balance which is not only exquisitely sensitive
and exact, but allows us to obtain direct comparative measures of the
force or disturbances produced by the introduction of any metal or
conductor.
    The instrument which       I  have the honour to present to the Royal
Society this evening, consists, 1st, of the new induction-currents
balance; 2nd, microphone, with a clock as a source of sound; 3rd,
electric sonometer, or absolute sound measurer, a late invention of my
own; 4th, a receiving telephone and three elements of Daniells'
battery.

1879.]               On an Induction-Currents Balance.                                57
    In order to have a perfect induction-currents balance suitable for
physical research, all its coils as well as the size and amount of wire
should be equal. The primary and secondary coils should be separate
and not superposed. The exterior diameter of the coils presented this
evening is 54 centims, having an interior vacant circular space of
3# centims.; the depth of this flat coil or spool is 7 millims.
   Upon this box-wood spool are wound 100 metres of No. 32 silk
covered copper wire.     I
                        use four of such coils, formed into two pairs, the
secondary coil being fixed permanently, or by means of an adjustable
slide, at a distance of 5 millims. from its primary; on the second
similar pair there is a fine micrometer screw, allowing me to adjust
the balance to the degree of perfection required.
   These two pair of coils should be placed at a distance not less than
1 metre from each other, so that no disturbing cause should exist from
their proximity.
  The two primary coils are joined in series to the battery, the circuit
also passing through the microphone.
   In place of the telephone         I
                                    have sometimes used a magnetic
pendulum, the swing of the arc described indicating and measuring
the forces.*     I  am at present engaged       upon a very sensitive
voltameter which shall indicate and measure the force of rapid in
duced currents.     The telephone, however, is well adapted as an
indicator, but not as a measurer of the forces brought into action.
For this reason  I  have joined to this instrument an instrument to
which I have given the name of electric sonometer. This consists of
three coils similar to those already described, two of which are placed
horizontally at a fixed distance of 40 centims. apart, and the com
munication with the battery is so arranged that there are similar but
opposing poles in each coil; between these there is a coil which can be
moved on a marked sliding scale divided into millimetres; in a line
with these two opposing primary coils, the centre coil is the secondary
one, and connected by means of a circuit changing key with the
telephone in place of the induction balance. If this secondary coil is
near either primary coil, we hear loud tones, due to          proximity. its

its relativedegree of increase; and this measure may be expressed in
the degrees of the millimetres passed through, or by the square of the
distances in accordance with the curve of electro-magnetic action.
    If we place in the coils of the induction balance a piece of metal,
say copper, bismuth, or iron, we at once produce a disturbance of the
balance, and it will give out sounds more or less intense on the tele
phone according to the mass, or if of similar sizes, according to the
molecular structure of the metal. The volume and intensity of sound
is invariably the same for a similar metal. If by means of the switch
ing key the telephone is instantly transferred to the sonometer, and
if its coil be at zero, we should hear sounds when key is up or in con
nection with the induction balance, and no sounds or silence when
the key is down or in connexion with the sonometer.         If the sono
meter coil was moved through several degrees, or through more than
the required amount, we should find that the sounds increase when
the key is depressed; but when the coil is moved to a degree where
there is absolute equality, if key is up or down, then the degree on
scale should give the true value of the disturbance produced in the
induction balance; and this is so exact that if we put, say a silver coin
whose value is 115°, no other degree will produce equality.          Once
knowing, therefore, the value of any metal or alloy, it is not necessary
to know in advance what the metal       for    its equality    is,

hearing power, we determine on a constant standard of force such as
one element Daniell, but if we increase the number of elements
we in same ratio increase the inductive disturbance, and thus by a
large increase of force bring within our range results too feeble to be
heard without its aid, the sonometer constantly, however, giving the
same degree for equality as the increased force is also used on this
instrument.   Thus in our measurements we can entirely neglect the
amount of battery, as its comparative results remain a constant.
   As a rule three Daniell elements will be found quite sufficient, and
even this weak force is so exquisitely sensitive that it will find out
the smallest fraction of difference in weight or structure of metals.
Thus two silver coins such as a shilling, both quite new, and both
apparently of the same weight, will be found to possess a difference of
weight which the instrument at once indicates.
  The following experiments will show its exceeding sensitiveness
and its wide field of usefulness as an instrument of research.
   I. If we introduce into one pair of the induction coils any conduct
ing body, such as silver, copper, iron, &c., there are set up in these
bodies electric currents which react both upon the primary and
secondary coils, producing extra currents whose force will be pro
portional to the mass, and to its specific conducting powers. A mili
gramme of copper on a fine iron wire, finer than the human hair, can
be loudly heard and appreciated by direct measurement, and its exact
value ascertained. We can thus weigh to an almost infinitesimal
degree the mass of the metal under examination; for instance, if we
take two English shilling pieces fresh from the Mint, and if they are
absolutely identical in form, weight, and material, they will be com
pletely balanced by placing one each in the two separate coils, pro
vided that for these experiments there is an adjustable resting place
in each pair of coils, so that each coin may lie exactly in the centre of
the vacant space between the primary and secondary coils.      however,     If,
these  shillings  are      in
                         the slightest degree  worn,     have         or
                                                                different   a
temperature, we         once perceive this difference, and
                          at                                     desired,   if

    These numbers do not agree entirely with any lists of electrical
conductivity 1 have yet met with; the numbers are, however, in
variably given by the sonometer, and the divergence may be due to
some peculiarity of structure of the metals when formed into disks.
Future investigations with this instrument will, no doubt, give more
correct values than                  I   have been able to obtain with my limited means
of research.
    III. It will be              seen from the above, that the instrument                              gives very
different values for different metals or alloys, consequently, we cannot
obtain a balance by employing two disks of different metals, and the
instrument is so sensitive to any variation in mass or matter, that it
instantly detects the difference by clear loud tones on the telephone.
     I
 If place two gold sovereigns of equal weight and value, one in each
coil, there is complete silence, indicating identity or equality between
them; but if one of them is a false sovereign, or even gold of a
 different alloy, the fact is instantly detected by the electrical balance
 being disturbed.                  The instrument thus becomes a rapid and perfect
 coin    detector,         and can assay any alloy, giving instantly its electrical
 value.        The        exceeding             sensitiveness of this electrical test                          I  shall
 demonstrate by experiment this evening.                              Again, as regards coins, it
 resolves an almost magical problem. Thus, if a person puts one or
 several coins into one pair of coils, the amount or nominal value being
 unknown to myself,                     I   have only to introduce into the opposite coils,
                                                       I
 different coins successively, as should weights in a scale, and when
 perfect balance is announced by the silence, the amount in one box
 will not only be the same nominal value but of the same kind of coin.
    IV. We find by direct experiment with this instrument, that the
 preceding results are due to electric currents, induced by the primary
 coil, and that it is by the reaction of these that the balance is
 destroyed, for, if we take an insulated spiral disk or helix of copper
 wire, with its terminal wires                           open, there is no disturbance of the
 balance whatever, notwithstanding that we have introduced a com
 paratively large amount of copper wire; but on closing the circuit,
 the balance is at once very powerfully disturbed.
     If the spiral is a flat one, resembling a disk of metal, and circuit
 closed, we find that loud tones result when the spiral is placed flat, or

when its wire is parallel to those on coils but if it is held at right
angles to these wires, no sound whatever is heard, and the balance
remains perfect.   The same thing occurs with disks of all non
magnetic metals, and a disk of metal placed perpendicular to the coils
exerts no influence whatever.                            The contrary result takes place with a
spiral of iron wire or disk of                       iron; the induced current circulating in
the spiral is at its maximum when the spiral lies flat or parallel with
the coils, being reduced to nothing when at right angles, but the dis
turbance of the induction   balance is more than four times as great
when the   spiral is perpendicular to the wires of the coils as when
parallel with the same.   That this result is simply due to the property
of magnetic bodies of conduction of magnetism, we shall see in some
following experiments.
   That the currents in non-magnetic metals travel in a circle corre
sponding to that of the primary coil, may be seen with spongy gold.

the absorption of work done in inducing the circular currents. This
can be perfectly balanced by placing a small coin or disk of silver or
copper in opposite coils; but if an iron wire or rod is placed perpendi
cular to the coils, then increase of inductive force takes place in those
coils by the conduction of induced magnetism from primary to secon
dary, and the iron can no longer be balanced by silver, copper, or any
non-magnetic metal.     The coils must be either removed farther apart,
so as to reduce the increased force, or balanced       by an equivalent
amount of iron or    magnetic  conduction in opposite coils.
  An interesting case of both reduction and increase of force in the
same pair of coils occurs if we place a disk of iron, not in the centre
of coils, but in the vacant space between the coils. We thus reduce
the force by 150°.    If, in addition to this, we place iron wires per
pendicular and in the centre, there is increase of force, and if this
increase is so proportioned as to be 150°, we immediately restore
the balance, and we have here in the same coil two separate pieces
of iron, each disturbing the balance and giving out loud tones, but
producing no effect whatever, when both are introduced at the same
time, complete silence being the result.
   VII. These coils prove what has already been long known, viz., that
hard steel has a far less conducting power for magnetism than soft
iron, although the hard steel has a far higher retaining power. This
instrument demonstrates a point, which             I
                                              have not yet seen remarked,
that   magnetism    does not in itself change   the conducting power, but
that it produces a molecular change of structure in iron, analogous to
that of tempering; for if we balance two soft iron rods against each
other, the balance being made perfect by the addition of fine iron
wires on the weakest side, we find that on strongly magnetising this
bar, by drawing it across a strong compound magnet, and on replacing
it in its coil, it has lost 30 per cent. of its conducting power; or                      if,
            magnetising, we make this iron red hot and plunge          cold
                                                                                  to in
instead  of                                                                  it

If  these experiments are repeated upon various degrees            iron ap  of
proaching steel       character, we find that       already possesses hard
                   it in

      It  measures also the electrostatic capacity of Leyden jars or con
  densers, and is sufficiently sensitive to appreciate and measure a surface
  of tinfoil not larger than 4 inches square, the condenser being simply
  placed between the wires of one pair of coils, and the disturbance pro
  duced being measured on the sonometer.
     I  could cite many more interesting experiments in other branches
  of   physical   research for which this instrument offers a wide field of
  observation; but my object this evening is neither to broach new
  theories nor to correlate at present the results obtained with views
  already advanced by Ampère and others.
     My only desire has been and is to show the wide field of research
  the instrument opens to physical inquirers.       I trust that in more able
  hands it   may   serve to elucidate  many physical  phenomena.
 IV. “Some         Researches    with Professor Hughes' new Instrument
         for the Measurement of Hearing; the Audiometer.”                     By
         BENJAMIN WARD          RICHARDSON,    M.D.,    LL.D.,    F.R.S. Re
         ceived May 14, 1879.
     Professor Hughes having done me the honour to show me first his
 newly invented instrument for the measurement of hearing, and having
 supplied me with an instrument for the purpose of testing the applica
 tion of it for physiological and practical purposes,     I have been enabled
 to make a considerable number of experiments, on which            I venture to
 submit the     following  preliminary  report:—
    The instrument, as it has been used, is before the Society. It con
 sists of two Leclanché's cells for the battery, a new and simple micro
phonic key connected with the cells and with two fixed primary coils,
and a secondary or induction coil the terminals of which are attached
to a telephone. The induction coil moves on a bar between the two
fixed coils, and the bar is graduated into 200 parts, by which the
readings of sound are taken. The graduated scale is divided into
20 centims, and each of these parts is subdivided into 10, so that the
hearing may be tested from the maximum of 200 units to 0°-zero.
The fixed coil on the right hand contains 6 metres of wire; the fixed
coil on the left hand contains 100 metres. By this means a long scale
from the left hand coil is produced. The secondary coil contains 100
metres of wire.
    In using the instrument, one Leclanché's cell has been found suffi
cient, as a general rule, but two have been used in instances where
the hearing of the person under test has been very defective.               The
Leclanché cell was selected      by Professor Hughes   as  affording  a reliable
current for the purposes he had in view, and for standard comparisons.

right ear only down           under ordinary breathing, could hear down

       Sphygmophone.”             By BENJAMIN WARD RICHARDSON, M.D.,
       LL.D., F.R.S. Received May 14, 1879.
    While experimenting with the audiometer, it occurred to me that
I   might get a secondary or telephonic sound from the movements
of the pulse at the wrist.             I have effected this in a very simple
manner, by adding a microphone to a Pond's sphygmograph.                I mount
on a  slip  of talc,  glass, wood,   or ebonite a plate of metal or gas  carbon.
I  place the slip in the sphygmograph as if about to take a tracing of
the pulse.       I   connect one terminal from a Leclanché's cell to the
metal or carbon, and the second terminal from the cell to a terminal of
the telephone.        Then   I  connect the other terminal of the telephone
 with the metal rod of the sphygmograph.               The instrument is now
ready for use. It is placed on the pulse, in the ordinary way, and is
adjusted, with the writing needle thrown back, until a good pulsa
ting movement of the          needle is secured.   When the movement is in
full action, the      needle   is thrown over to touch the platinum plate,
which it traverses with each pulse-movement, and completes the con
nexion between the telephone and the battery. The needle, in passing
over the metal or carbon plate, causes a distinct series of sounds from
the telephone, which correspond with the movements of the pulse.
When all is neatly adjusted, the sounds heard are three in number,
one long sound and two short, corresponding to the systolic push, the
arterial recoil, and the valvular check.          The sounds are singular, as
resembling the two words, “bother it.” The sounds can be made
very loud by increasing the battery power.
    This little instrument is not so good a recorder of the pulse as the
sphygmograph, but it may be made very useful in class, for illustrat
ing to a large number of students, at one time, the movements of the
natural pulse, and the variations which occur in disease.             I  call the
invention the sphygmophone.

 WI.   “On the Capillary Phenomena of Jets.” By Lord RAYLEIGH,
                      F.R.S.     Received May         5, 1879.
    When water issues under high pressure from a              circular orifice in a
 thin plate, a jet is formed whose section, though           diminished in area,
 retains the circular form.     But if the orifice be not    circular, the section
 of the jet undergoes remarkable transformations,              which were elabo
 rately investigated by Bidone,” many years ago.              The peculiarities of
 the orifice are exaggerated in the jet, but in an inverted                manner.
 The following examples are taken from Bidone's memoir.
                                      FIG.   1.
    Fig. 1, orifice in the form of an ellipse (A), of which the major
 axis is horizontal, and 24 lines long; the minor axis is vertical, and 17
 lines long.    The head of water is 6 feet.
    Near the orifice the sections of the vein are elliptical with major
 axis horizontal. The ellipticity gradually diminishes until at a distance
 of 30 lines from the orifice the section is circular.                Beyond this
 point the vertical axis of the section increases, and the horizontal axis
 decreases, so that the vein reduces itself to a flat vertical sheet, very
broad and thin.       This sheet preserves its continuity to a distance of
 6 feet from the orifice, where the vein        is penetrated by air.
    B  represents  the section at a distance of 30 lines from the orifice.
It is a circle of 16 or 17 lines diameter.
    C is the section at a distance of 6 inches from the orifice. It is an

    D is the section at 24 inches from the orifice. It also is an ellip
tical figure, whose vertical axis is 45 lines long and horizontal axis
about 12 lines long.                                                  -
    In fig. 2, the orifice (A) is an equilateral triangle, with sides 2
inches long. The head of water is 6 feet. The vein resolves itself
into three flat sheets disposed symmetrically round the axis, the plaries

of the   sheets being perpendicular    to the sides of the orifice. These
sheets are   very  thin, and retain their transparence and continuity to a
distance of 42    inches, reckoned from the orifice. The sections repre
sented by B, C, D, E are taken at distances from the orifice equal
respectively to 1 inch, 6 inches, 12 inches, and 24 inches.
    Similarly, a vein issuing from an orifice in the form of a regular
polygon, of any number of sides, resolves itself into an equal number

of thin sheets, whose planes are perpendicular to the sides of the
polygon.
   Bidone explains the formation of these sheets, in the main (as it
appears to me), satisfactorily, by reference to simpler cases of meeting
streams. Thus equal jets, moving in the same straight line, with equal
and opposite velocities, flatten themselves into a disk, situated in the
perpendicular    plane. If the axes of the jets intersect obliquely, a
sheet is formed symmetrically in the plane perpendicular to that of the
impinging jets.     Those portions of a jet which proceed from the out
lying parts of an unsymmetrical orifice are considered to behave, in
some degree, like independent meeting streams.
   In many cases, more especially when the orifices are small and the
heads of water low, the extension of the sheets in directions perpen
dicular to the jet reaches a limit. Sections taken at greater distances
from the orifice show a gradual shortening of the sheets, until a com
pact form is attained, similar to that at the first contraction.          Beyond
this point, if the jet retains                         its
                                     coherence, sheets are gradually thrown

   The agreement of the second and third columns is pretty good on
the whole.  Small discrepancies at the bottom of the table may be
due to the uncertainty attaching to the zero point of pressure, and
also to another cause, which will be referred to later. At the higher
pressures the observed wave-lengths have a marked tendency to in
crease more rapidly than the velocity of the jet.    This result, which
was confirmed by other observations, points to a departure from the
law of isochronous vibration. Strict isochronism is only to be expected
when vibrations are infinitely small, that     the present application         is,    in
when the section     the jet never deviates more than infinitesimally
                             of
from the circular form.    During the vibrations with which Table                                                                Iis
concerned, however, the departures from circularity are very con
siderable, and there    no reason for supposing that such vibrations

   In this case the law is fully verified, the discrepancies being de
cidedly within the limits of experimental error.
   On the other hand, the discrepancies may be exaggerated by the
use of higher pressures. Table              III   relates to the same orificet as
Table I. Instead of the stoneware bottle, a tall wooden box was used

   The third column contains numbers proportional to the square roots
of the pressures. In the fourth column a correction is introduced,
the significance of which will be explained later.
   The value of A, other things being the same, depends upon the
nature of the fluid.               Thus methylated alcohol gave a wave-length
about twice as great as tap water.                        This is a consequence of the
smaller capillarity.
   If a water jet be touched by a fragment of wood moistened with
oil, the waves in front of the place of contact are considerably drawn
out; but no sensible effect appears to be propagated up the stream.
   If a jet of mercury discharging into dilute sulphuric acid be
polarized by an electric current, the change in the capillary constant
discovered by Lipmann shows itself by alterations in the length of
the wave.
   When       the wave-length is considerable in comparison with the
diameter of the jet, the vibrations about the circular form take place
practically in two dimensions, and are easily calculated mathematically.
The more general case, in which there is no limitation upon the mag
nitude of the diameter, involves the use of Bessel's functions.                                  The
investigation will be found in Appendix I. For the present we will
confine ourselves to a statement of the results for vibrations in two
dimensions.
   Let us suppose that the polar equation of the section is
                                        r=ao-Han cos n0        .    .  .     .    .   .   (1),
so that the curve is an undulating                    one, repeating     itself n times over
the circumference.               The   mean     radius is a, ; and, since the deviation
from the circular form is small, an is a small quantity in comparison
with ao. The vibration is expressed by the variation of an as a har
monic function of the time. Thus if an occos (pt-e), it may be proved
that
                                  p=7'T'p"A-"v(n3–n)                .  .     .    .   .   (2).
In this equation T is the superficial tension,                   p the density, A the area
of the section       (equal      to  Tao"), and the      frequency    of vibration is p--27.
   For a jet of given fluid and of given area, the frequency of vibration
varies as V(n”—n) or                 V (n-1)n(n+1).              The   case      of   n==1    corre

sponds to a displacement of the jet as a whole, without alteration in
the form of the boundary.      Accordingly there is no potential energy,
and the     frequency  of vibration is zero. For n=2 the boundary is
elliptical, for n=3 triangular with rounded corners, and so on. With
most forms of orifice the jet is subject to more than one kind of
vibration at the same time. Thus with a square orifice vibrations
would occur corresponding to n=4, n=8, n=12, &c.            However, the
higher modes of vibrations are quite subordinate, and may usually be
neglected.     The values of V(n”—n) for various values of   n are shown
below.
                  n=   2,    p = x/6         =  V/6 x  1
                  m= 3,      p= V6X     V 4= x/6 x     2
                  n = 4,     p= x/6x   V 10= x/6x      3 16
                  m= 5,      p= x/6x   V 20= x/6 x     4 47
                  n = 6,     p= V6X    V 35= V6 x      5 92
                  n = 7,     p= x/6x V 56= x/6 x       7 48
                  m= 8,      p= x/6x V 84= x/6x        9:17
                  m=  9,     p= V6 x V120=      x/6 x 10 95
                  n=12,      p=   V/6x V286= x/6 x 16 95
It  appears that the frequency for n=3 is just double that for n=2;
so that the wave-length for a triangular jet should be the half of that
of an elliptical jet of equal area, the other circumstances being the
Sanne.
   For a given fluid and mode of vibration (n), the frequency varies
as A", the thicker jet having the longer time of vibration. If v be the
velocity of the jet, A=2 Top".        If the jet convey a given volume
of fluid, v oc  A",  and thus X oc A*.      Accordingly in the case of a
jet falling vertically, the increase of A due to velocity is in great
measure compensated       by the decrease due to diminishing area of
section.
    The law of variation of p for a given mode of vibration with the
nature of the fluid, and the area of the section, may be found by con
siderations of dimensions.     T is a force divided by a line, so that its
dimensions are 1 in mass, 0 in length, and –2 in time. The volume
density p is of 1 dimension in mass, –3 in length, and 0 in time. A
is of course of 2 dimensions in length, and 0 in mass and time. Thus
the only combination of T, p, A, capable of representing a frequency,
is Tip-A-".
   The above reasoning proceeds upon the assumption of the applica
bility of the law of isochronism. In the case of large vibrations, for
which the law would not be true, we may still obtain a good deal of
information by the method of dimensions. The shape of the orifice
being given, let us inquire into the nature of the dependence of A.
upon T, p, A, and P, the pressure under which the jet escapes.       The

   In applying this formula it must be remembered that A is the area
of the section of the jet, and not the area of the aperture.
We might indeed deduce the value of A from the area of the
aperture by introduction of a coefficient of contraction (about 62);
but the area of the aperture itself is not very easily measured.
It is much better to calculate A from an observation of the
quantity of fluid (V), discharged under a measured head (h'), com
parable in magnitude with that prevailing when X is measured.        Thus
A=V (2gh')". In the following calculations the C.G.S. system of
units is employed.
   In the case of the elliptical aperture of Table II, the value of A
was found in this way to be 6695. Hence at a head of 10.7 the wave
length should be
                      A= v/(2g x 10:7) x ('0695)'-237 5
                                   3:38 v6
the value of g being taken at 981.       The corresponding observed value
of  X is 2:55.
   Again, in the case of the experiments recorded in Table IV, it was
found that A='0660.         Hence for h=29-0 the value of the wave
length should be given by
                                 #=878.
                       x_(20:290)×(0600).
The corresponding observed value is 3.95.
   We will next take the triangular orifice of Table V. The value of
A was found to be 154. Hence for a head of 9.2 the value of A,
calculated a priori, is
                       x=x(20%"2)×(154)'=1.99,

as compared with 2:3 found by direct observation.
    For the square orifice of Table     VII,  we have  A="153.    Hence, if
 h=16.7,                              -

 as compared with 1.85 by observation.
    It will   be remarked   that in every case the observed value of X.
 somewhat exceeds the calculated value. The discrepancies are to be
 attributed, not so much,      I  imagine, to errors of observation as to
 excessive   amplitude   of  vibration,   involving a departure from the
 frequency proper to infinitely small amplitudes.        The closest agree
 ment is in the case of Table IV, where the amplitude of vibration was
 smallest.      It is also possible that the capillary tension actually

 operative in these experiments was somewhat less than that deter
 mined by Quincke for distilled water.
    When the pressures are small, the wave-lengths are no longer con
 siderable in comparison with the diameter of the jet, and the vibra
 tions cannot be supposed to take place sensibly in two dimensions.
 The frequency of vibration then becomes itself a function of the
 wave-length.        This question is investigated mathematically in
 Appendix I. For the case of n=4, it is proved that approximately
                               ='(1+')
                              r=:             30X2 J"
 Hence for the aperture of Table        VII,
                              X oc Vh (1–'088X-8),
 M  being expressed in centimetres. The numbers in the fourth column
 of the table are calculated according to this formula.
    On the other hand at high pressures the frequency becomes a
 function of the pressure.        Since frequency is always an even function
 of   amplitude,    and in the present application, the square of the
 amplitude varies as h, the wave-length is given approximately by an
 expression of the form Vh (M-H Nh), where M and N are constants.
 It appears   from experiment, and might,         I   think, have been expected,
that   frequency    diminishes as  amplitude   increases,    so that N is positive.
    When the aperture has the form of an exact circle, and when the
flow of fluid in its neighbourhood is unimpeded by obstacles, there is
 a perfect balance of lateral motions and pressures, and consequently
nothing to render the jet in its future course unsymmetrical.             Even in
this case, however, the phenomena are profoundly modified by the
operation of the capillary force. Far from retaining the cylindrical
form unimpaired, the jet rapidly resolves itself in a more or less
regular manner into detached masses. It has, in fact, been shown by
Plateau,” both from theory and experiment, that in consequence of
surface-tension the cylinder is an unstable form of equilibrium, when
its length exceeds its circumference.
    The circumstances attending the resolution of a cylindrical jet into
drops have been admirably examined and described by Savart,t and
for the most part explained with great sagacity by Plateau. There
are, however, a few points which appear not to have been adequately
treated hitherto; and in order to explain myself more effectually

of the note, though not absolutely definite, cannot differ much from
that which corresponds to the division of the jet into wave-lengths of
maximum instability; and, in fact, Savart found that the frequency
was directly as the square root of the head, inversely as the diameter
of the orifice, and independent of the nature of the fluid—laws which
follow immediately from Plateau's theory.
   From the pitch of the note due to a jet of given diameter, and issuing
under a given head, the wave-length of the nascent divisions can be at
once deduced. Reasoning from some observations of Savart, Plateau
finds in this way 4:38 as the ratio of the length of a division to the
diameter of the jet. The diameter of the orifice was 3 millims., from
which that of the jet is deduced by the introduction of the coeffi
cient 8. Now that the length of a division has been estimated a priori,
it is perhaps preferable to reverse Plateau's calculation, and to exhibit
the frequency of vibration in terms of the other data of the problem.

   But the most certain method of obtaining complete regularity of
resolution is to bring the reservoir under the influence of an external
vibrator, whose pitch is approximately the same as that proper to the
jet. Magnus" employed a Neef’s hammer, attached to the wooden frame
which supported the reservoir.        Perhaps an electrically maintained
tuning-fork is still better. Magnus showed that the most important
part of the effect is due to the forced vibration of that side of the
vessel which contains the orifice, and that but little of it is propagated
through the air. With respect to the limits of pitch, Savart found
that the note might be a fifth above, and more than an octave below,
that proper to the jet. According to theory, there would be no well
defined lower     limit; on the other side, the external vibration cannot
be  efficient if it tends to produce divisions whose length is less than
the circumference of the jet. This would give for the interval defining
the upper limit T : 4:508, which is very nearly a fifth. In the case of
Plateau's numbers (T : 438) the discrepancy is a little greater.
   The detached masses into which a jet is resolved do not at once
assume and retain a spherical form, but execute a series of vibrations,
being alternately compressed and elongated in the direction of the axis
of symmetry. When the resolution is effected in a perfectly periodic
manner, each drop is in the same phase of its vibration as it passes
through a given point of space; and thence arises the remarkable
appearance of alternate swellings and contractions described by Savart.
The interval from one swelling to the next is the space described by
                          * “Pogg. Ann.,” bd.cvi, 1859.

 the drop during one complete vibration, and is therefore (as Plateau
 shows) proportional caeteris paribus to the square root of the head.
    The time of vibration is of course itself a function of the nature of
 the fluid and of the size of the drop. By the method of dimensions
 alone it may be seen that the time of infinitely small vibrations varies
 directly as the square root of the mass of the sphere and inversely as
 the square root of the capillary tension; and in Appendix            II it is
 proved that its expression is

 V   being the volume of the vibrating mass.
    In an experiment arranged to determine the time of vibration, a
 stream of 19.7 cub. centims. per second was broken up under the
 action of a fork making 128 vibrations per second.          Neglecting the
mass of the small spherules (of which more will be said presently), we
get for the mass of each sphere 19-7+128, or 154 grm.; and thence
by (10), taking as before T=81,                       -
                              T='0473 second.
 The distance between the first and    second swellings was      by measure
ment 16.5 centims. The level of the contraction       midway     between the
 two swellings was 36.8 centims, below the surface of the liquid in the
reservoir, corresponding to a velocity of 175 centims. per second. These
 data give for the time of vibration,
                       7=16.5+368='0612       second.
The discrepancy    between the two values of t, which is greater than
I   had  expected,  is doubtless due in part to excessive amplitude,
rendering the vibration slower than that calculated for infinitely small
amplitudes.
    A rough estimate of the degree of flattening to be expected at the
first swelling may be arrived at by calculating the eccentricity of the
oblatum, which has the same volume and surface as those appertaining
to the portion of fluid in question when forming part of the undis
turbed cylinder.     In the case of the most natural mode of resolution,
the volume of a drop is 9ta", and its surface is 18wa”. The eccen
tricity of the oblatum which has this volume and this surface is 944,
corresponding to a ratio of principal axes equal to about 1:3.
   In consequence of the rapidity of the motion some optical device is
necessary to render apparent the phenomena attending the disintegra
tion of a jet. Magnus employed a rotating mirror, and also a rotating
disk from which a fine slit was cut out. The readiest method of
obtaining instantaneous illumination is the electric spark, but with
this Magnus was not successful. “The rounded masses of which the
swellings consist reflect the light emanating from a point in such a

manner that the eye sees only the single point of each, which is prin
cipally illuminated.  Hence, when the stream is illuminated by the
electric spark, the swellings appear like a string of pearls; but their
form cannot be recognised, because the intensity of the light reflected
from the remaining portions of the masses is too small to allow this,
on account of the velocity with which the impression is lost.”     The
electric spark had, however, been used successfully for this purpose
some years before by Buff,t who observed the shadow of the jet on a
white screen. Preferable to an opaque screen in my experience is a
piece of ground glass, which allows the shadow to be examined from the
further side.         I
                  have found also that the jet may be very well ob
served directly, if the illumination is properly managed. For this
purpose it is necessary to place the jet between the source of light
and the eye. The best effect is obtained when the light of the spark
is somewhat diffused by being passed (for example) through a piece
of ground glass.                              -

it   has freed    itself from the in front, and thus the resulting
                                      mass
spherule acquires a backwards relative velocity, which of necessity
leads to a collision.  Under ordinary circumstances the spherule
rebounds, and may be thus reflected backwards and forwards several
times between the adjacent masses.         But if the jet be subject to
moderate electrical influence, the spherule amalgamates with a larger
mass at the first opportunity." Magnus showed that the stream of
spherules may be diverted into another path by the attraction of a
powerfully electrified rod, held a little below the place of resolution.
   Very interesting modifications of these phenomena are observed
when a jet from an orifice in a thin platet is directed obliquely up
wards.    In this case drops which break away with different velocities
are carried under the action of gravity into different paths; and thus
under ordinary circumstances a jet is apparently resolved into a “sheaf,”
or bundle of jets all lying in one vertical plane. Under the action
of a vibrator of suitable periodic time the resolution is regularised,
and then each drop, breaking away under like conditions, is projected
with the same velocity, and therefore follows the same path. The .
apparent gathering together of the sheaf into a fine and well-defined
stream is an effect of singular beauty.
   In certain cases where the tremor to which the jet is subjected is
compound, the single path is replaced by two, three, or even more
paths, which the drops follow in a regular cycle. The explanation has
been given with remarkable insight by Plateau.           If for example
besides the   principal disturbance, which determines the size of the
drops, there be another of twice the period, it is clear that the alter
nate drops break away under different conditions and therefore with
different velocities. Complete periodicity is only attained after the
passage of a pair of drops; and thus the odd series of drops pursues
one path, and the even series another.                     I

  the vertical plane, by causing the coalescence    of drops which    come into
  contact.    When    the projection is nearly vertical, the whole scattering
  is due to collisions, and is destroyed by electricity.       If the resolution
 into   drops   is  regularised  by  vibrations of suitable frequency, the
  principal drops follow the same path, and unless the projection is
 nearly vertical, there are no collisions, as explained in my former
  paper. It sometimes happens that the spherules are projected laterally
  in a distinct stream, making a considerable angle with the main stream.
  This is the result of collisions between the spherules and the principal
  drops.    I believe that the former are often reflected backwards and
 forwards several times, until at last they escape laterally. Occasionally
 the principal drops themselves collide in a regular manner, and ulti
 mately escape in a double stream.        In all cases the behaviour under
 electrical influence is a criterion of the occurrence of collisions. The
 principal phenomena are easily observed directly, with the aid of
 instantaneous illumination.

     The subject of this appendix is the mathematical investigation of
 the motion of frictionless fluid under the action of capillary force, the
 configuration of the fluid differing infinitely little from that of equi
 librium in the form of an infinite circular cylinder.
     Taking the axis of the cylinder as axis of 2, and polar co-ordinate r,6
 in the perpendicular plane, we may express the form of the surface at
 any time t by the equation

 in which     f (6,2) is always a small quantity.      By Fouriers theorem,
the arbitrary function       f may be expanded in a series of terms of the
type 2, cos nd cos kz; and, as we shall see in the course of the in
vestigation, each of these terms may be considered independently of
the others. The summation extends to all positive values of k, and to
              -"
all positive integral values of n, zero included.
     During the motion the quantity an does not remain absolutely con
stant, and must be determined by the condition                that the inclosed
volume is invariable.       Now for the surface.

no force of restitution            for   the case of a displacement in two

   For the application to        a  jet the progressive wave must                       be reduced
to steady motion by the superposition of a common velocity (v) equal
and opposite to that of the wave's propagation.                            The solution then

modes of vibrations symmetrical about an axis, which is sufficient for

only Legendre's functions P, ; the more general problem, involving
Laplace's functions, may be treated in the same way, and leads to

    The object of the present paper is to investigate the expressions
which present themselves in the mathematical treatment of the problem
of the conduction of heat in an ellipsoid of revolution. The results
obtained constitute a generalisation of the corresponding solution for
the sphere, and are found, in the first instance, for an ellipsoid whose
major axis is the axis of revolution, but a slight alteration will render
them applicable also to a planetary ellipsoid.               We may effect the
transformation to ellipsoidal co-ordinates of the general equation of
conduction as follows: the semi-axes of the ellipsoid and hyperboloid
through any point confocal to the surface being denoted by c cosha,
c sinha, and c cos B, csin B, the co-ordinates of the point may be expressed
by c cos p sinho sin B, csin psinha sin B, c cosha cos B, and the general

             a
       Force in Magnets, demonstrating the Obliquity of the
       Equator and Axis of Bar Magnets.”      By RICHARD C.
       SHETTLE, M.D.   Communicated by Dr. RoySTON-PIGOTT,
       F.R.S. Received April 24, 1879.
  It   was not until some thousand observations had been made in the
manner about to be described, that        I
                                     was rewarded with the discovery
of the obliquity of the bar magnetic equator, which is the subject of
the present communication.
  On a former occasion the Royal Society did me the honour of
accepting a similar research on the magnetic condition of arterial and
venous blood.
  My present object is to detail the manner in which have been led   I
up to the result now obtained.
  It appeared to me that the usual method of displaying magnetic
currents by means of the curves assumed by steel filings were only
rough approximations.
                   I
   Long after had been occupied with these observations         became         I
aware, through the kindness of Professor Stokes, Secretary to the Royal
Society, that Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, had in a short
paper in the “Transactions,” investigated (with a pocket compass fur
nished with a magnetic inch-needle) these lines of force. The method
         I
which have adopted is essentially different, and greatly exceeds in
delicacy.
1st.—Inch        magnetized steel needles were suspended and nicely balanced
                        on a single silk fibre 6 inches long.
  These needles carried over the magnets assumed rapidly changing
positions, and readily demonstrated, as in the paper alluded        the              to,
varying force and direction    usually portrayed
                                  as                 treatises  inmag               on
netism. But these long needles utterly failed            in
                                               the niceties    research       of
on which  I was employed.
2nd.—Needles varying from half     inch  an
                                          the 1–16th

            mounted and  suspended      similar manner.

  This obliquity of the magnetic equator of the bar is demonstrated by
the coup d’aeil of the curves traced out magnetically, as shown in
fig. 1.
   The magnetic lines are the outcome of some thousand observations.”
   The oblique convergency of the magnetic lines towards the north
and south poles is strongly pronounced, and a neutral zone was disco
vered, which is indicated in fig. 1 by crosses + +.
   The region of this neutral zone was explored by examining all
those points where the suspended magnetic particle of steel exhibited
indifference, either of its poles being observed to be equally attracted.
   This interesting experiment can be far better appreciated by actual
observation than by description, and is best shown perhaps by carry
ing the 1-4th inch test-magnet from the north towards the south pole
across the equator. When over the north side of the equator the
south pole dips; if it be then allowed to fall upon the bar, and is
raised again, the south pole will leave the bar last. When it has been
carried south across the equator the north pole dips, but if it be again
allowed to fall upon the bar, and is once more raised, the south pole
will leave the bar last, just as it did on the north side of the equator.
   But this novel feature of an oblique zone is more beautifully dis
played by examining small curves, traced out in the way indicated, by
the smallest test-magnets near the geometrical centre of the bar, for
lines equidistant from its axis.
   The obliquity (measured as close as possible to the bar by means of
curves traced out so as to enter the two sides of the bar) has a very
equable value, varying according to the nature of the magnet, as
regards the intensity of the magnetism, the quality of the material,
and      its
         temper, from         10°; and this result
                                 7°   to             confirmedis   the           by

 III.   “Preliminary Report to the Committee on Solar Physics on
        a Method of Detecting the Unknown Inequalities of a
        Series of Observations.”       By BALFOUR STEWART, F.R.S.,
        Professor of Natural     Philosophy    in Owens College, Man
        chester, and WILLIAM DODGSON.            Communicated to the
        Royal Society at the request of the Committee. Received
        May 15, 1879.
     1. Our chief reason for suspecting the existence of a connexion
between the state of the solar surface (as this is revealed by spots) and
the magnetism and meteorology of the earth is derived from the fact
that our observational series of sun-spots, on the one hand, and of mag
netical and meteorological changes, on the other, are believed to be all
subject to a common inequality, whose period (about 11 years) is
virtually the same in all. But as it is only of late years that observa
tions of great accuracy have been made in these three branches of
inquiry, it is impossible to compare together more than a few series of
long-period inequality, and hence some observers are still inclined to
 doubt the reality of a true connexion between the sun and the earth of
the kind above mentioned.        We are thus led to ask ourselves whether
there may not be other inequalities of shorter period in these various
 observations, and whether we cannot devise some means of ascertaining
 the exact periodical times of these as well as their other properties.
     We might thus expect to decide the question regarding a connexion
 between these three branches, for if solar observations and those of
 terrestrial magnetism and meteorology all exhibit a series of inequa
 lities that are essentially the same in each, it is impossible to call in
 question the reality of some connexion between them.
     2. The researches of Broun, Hornstein, Baxendell, and others have
 indicated the probable existence of inequalities in magnetism and
 meteorology, with periods of comparatively short length.      Messrs. De
 La Rue, Stewart, and Loewy have likewise observed indications of a
 short-period fluctuation in sun-spots; but we are not aware that any
 attempt has yet been made to ascertain with great precision the exact
 period or periods of unknown inequalities either in terrestrial or in
 sun-spot observations.
     As our sun-spot records have not yet been rendered sufficiently com
 plete, it may be questioned whether the time has yet arrived for
 attempting any such investigation with respect to them; but our
 records of observations in magnetism and meteorology are now so
 long-continued and complete as to render it desirable in their case to
 make the attempt. This we have done in the following preliminary
 investigation.
     3. We began first of   all by making  use  of the records of the Kew

  1879.]         Report to  the Committee on     Solar Physics.          107
  Observatory, which one of us had received through the kindness of the
  Kew Committee.      In these the daily ranges of the magnetic declina
 tion are given after excluding disturbed observations by the process of
  Sir E. Sabine. The daily ranges are given in inches, and they denote
 the differences between the greatest and least values of each day's
 hourly tabulations from the curve, disturbances (as already mentioned)
 being excluded.     These records extend from the beginning of 1858 to
 the end of  1873,  embracing   in all 16 years’ observations.
    4. Let us now proceed to describe the method which we pursued in
 our search for the natural inequalities of magnetic declination.        We
 may illustrate this by a well-known case. Suppose that we had in our
 possession extensive records of the temperature of the earth's atmo
 sphere at some one place in middle latitudes, and that, independently
 of astronomical knowledge, we were to make use of these for the pur
 pose of investigating the natural inequalities of terrestrial temperature.
 We should begin by grouping the observations according to various
 periods taken, say, at small but definite time-intervals from each other.
 Now, if our series of observations were sufficiently extensive, and if
 some one of our various groupings together of this series should cor
 respond to a real inequality, we should expect it to exhibit a well
 defined and prominent fluctuation, whose departures above and below
 the mean should be of considerable amount.           Suppose, for instance,
 that we have 24       points  in our   series, and that we group a long
 series of temperature observations in rows of 24 each, the time
 distance between two contiguous members of one row being one
 hour. The series would thus represent the mean solar day, and we
should no doubt obtain from a final summation of our rows a result
 exhibiting   a prominent     temperature fluctuation of a well-defined
 character, which we might measure by simply adding together all the
departures of its various points from the mean, whether these points
lie above or below; in fine, by obtaining the area of the curve which is
the graphical representation of the inequality above and below the
line of abscissae taken to represent the mean of all the points.
 Suppose next that, still keeping to rows of 24, we should make the
time interval between two contiguous members of a row somewhat
different from one hour, whether greater or less, we should now in
either case obtain a result exhibiting, when measured as above, a much
smaller inequality than that given when the interval was exactly one
hour, and it is even possible that if our series of observations were
sufficiently extensive, we should obtain hardly any traces of an inequality
whatever.     In fine, when each row accurately represented a solar day
the result would give an inequality of large amount, but when each
row represented a period either slightly less or greater than a day the
result would be an inequality of small amount.
   5. We should by this process, after bestowing enormous labour in

  108              Prof. B. Stewart and W. Dodgson.             [May 29,
 grouping    according  to a great   number of periods    taken at small
 intervals from each other obtain definite results. These results might
 be graphically represented in the following manner: . the line of
 abscissae might be taken to denote the exact values of the various
 periods, forming a time scale in fact; while the ordinates might repre
 sent the final observed inequalities found by employing these various
 periods. There would thus be in the case now used for illustration a
 very prominent peak, corresponding to 24 hours, which would fall off
 rapidly on either side,
    In this particular instance, having obtained as a result a period of
exactly 24 hours, there would probably be no occasion to do anything
 more, because we have no reason to suppose the existence of any other
 temperature period very near 24 hours in addition to the one exactly
 corresponding thereto. We might, therefore, proceed finally to evaluate
the obtained inequality, which would represent the mean daily varia
 tion of temperature.
    6. It would be different, however, should there prove to be a number
 of inequalities having periods very close to one another on the time
scale.    In this case, even when we had obtained a graphical repre
sentation of our results in the manner just now mentioned, it might be
supposed that the various inequalities to some extent interfered with
each other, affecting not only the position in the time-scale of the
points of maximum inequality, but also the extent of range and the
form of these inequalities.      We should, therefore, have next to
attempt to eliminate the effect of one inequality upon another.
    The whole process would thus consist of two parts. In the first
place, by enormous labour, we should have to obtain a graphical result.
showing the exact positions in the time-scale of the points of observed
maximum inequality. Secondly, we should have to eliminate the effect
of the various inequalities upon each other, provided it be found that
there are several such inequalities very close together. In the present
preliminary report we exhibit a method by which the great labour of
the first of these two processes is materially abridged.
    We have not, however, as yet advanced sufficiently far in our accu
rate estimation of observed maximum periods to proceed to the elimi
nation of the effect of the various inequalities upon each other.
    7. In testing our method, we began by grouping the Kew declina
tion ranges in such a manner as to represent a period of 24:25 days. It
is unnecessary to describe the details of the method by which a series
of daily observations may be grouped so as to represent a period that
is not an exact number of days; suffice it to say that we at length
obtained a long series of upwards of 240 rows, each embracing 24
horizontal figures. Nor need we give the reasons which induced us to
select the precise period of 24:25 days, since for all practical purposes
this may be regarded as a period chosen at random.

  Having grouped the whole 16 years' observations according to this
period, we next broke up these into yearly sets. Each of these sets
might thus be expected to be freed from the influence of the well
known          annual inequality                       of declination range. These yearly sets

   10. We have found it necessary to push things not merely by the
multiple of a whole division—right or left each year—but by the
multiple of half a division.
   To accomplish this we must obtain for every alternate year a series
of half-way points, which is best done by converting the series of
such years into curves, and using these to give us the half-way points.
  For instance, should we wish to pull things to the left half a division
each year, we should adopt the following arrangement.—
 1858       .         .    (0%)58,        (1});s, (2)58          .   .    (21');s,    (22%);s, (23%)58.
 1859       .         .     (1)59,        (2)59,     (3)59       .   .    (22)59,     (23),     (0)59.
 1860       .         .    (14)00         (2})00,    (3%)00      .   .    (22%)00,   (23%),     (0%)60.
 1861       .         .    (2)61,         (3)61,      (4)6.      .   .    (23)61      (0)61,    (1)61.
  A further  extension of the same method would enable us to go from
halves to  quarters of a division, but we have not yet met with any
inequality that is not sufficiently well indicated by half divisions.
   11. We have found the following plan very useful in abridging the
                                                                      -
labour of these reductions.
   Sixteen perfectly similar strips of thick paper are taken, one for
each year.      Each of these strips is divided into 48 small com
partments, a vertical black line being ruled at the beginning, the
middle, and the end. Upon the first of these strips the inequality,
say for 1858, is written in duplicate, so that the second 24
figures are a repetition of the first. The same is done for the other
years.    These strips are then attached to a frame which allows them
to slide along with regard to each other, and at the same time only
exposes 24 lines of figures at a time.         By this method they can
easily be arranged according to any given order, and the sums made
with very little trouble.
   It is further desirable to exhibit all the positive values, say in black,
and   all
       the negative values                     in   red,   so   that the eye may easily distinguish
between them.
  The following will exhibit the nature                              of   the arrangement—only            to
save space we take                   an   inequality consisting           of   only four terms.

     The vertical portion           between    the brackets is here all that is      ex
  posed.
     12. Before concluding this description of our method we ought to
  remark that it can only be considered as correct for periods not far
  removed on either side from that for which the series or book (as we
  call it) was originally framed. Thus, in the present instance, while
 the results of Table         I   will readily indicate inequalities that lie six
 divisions (of 0.067     day       each) either to the right or left of the normal
 series, it is apparent that +12 divisions from the normal must neces
 sarily exhibit the same result as -12; it will not therefore do to push
 the method nearly so far.

 the one for 24:25 days, the construction of which we have already
 described. Both have been treated in precisely the same manner.

    It will at once       be seen from this curve that              it exhibits very nearly
the same       positions        for maximum inequalities              as       those shown     in
fig. I.
    Thus, by selecting at random the period 24:25 days we are by our
method referred to nearly the true positions of the various maximum
inequalities, and it might then be well to construct a separate book for
each of these, as we have done for the large inequality corresponding
to 24 days nearly.
    17.  While this method has                 succeeded      in bringing before us the
hitherto unknown inequalities of the Kew declination-range, it might
yet be imagined that the results obtained are of a local or semi-local,
and not of a truly cosmical nature. To test this we have compared
together the daily declination-ranges as recorded at Trevandrum by
Mr. Broun during the years 1858-64, with the corresponding por
tions of the Kew series.                Plotting these in series of 24 days each
we have obtained             by   the method already described the following
results:—

    The results of Table V are exhibited graphically in Diagram                               II,
 figs. V, VI, No. V denoting the Kew, and No. VI the Trevandrum
inequality.
    18. We see from Table V that the maximum inequality occurs for
these 7 years, both for Kew and Trevandrum, at points not far
distant from 24:00 days.               There are thus exhibited signs of repetition
in this Kew inequality, as well as evidences of its cosmical nature,
inasmuch as Trevandrum gives results similar to Kew as far as period
is concerned.
    19.  We shall now compare together the forms of the inequalities in
these two places.

    The results of the above table are graphically represented by a
curve in Diagram I, fig. III. It will be seen that there is a great,
though not absolutely exact, coincidence between the periods recorded
in this curve, and those of the same diagram which exhibit the
declination    results.
    The form of the temperature inequality for 24 days, see Table VI,
is exhibited in Diagram II, fig. IV. It will be seen that there is a
considerable likeness in form between the various curves of this
diagram; but it must not be forgotten that these curves are in all
probability affected by the influence of adjacent inequalities.

  22.  We have thus given our method a preliminary        trial, and the
result is we think decidedly hopeful, We are inclined    to believe that
when more completely worked out it may not only reduce to certainty
the existence of periods of short range in terrestrial magnetism and
meteorology, but also give determinations of the exact lengths of these
periods, and of the forms of the inequalities.
  We would remark, in conclusion, that a glance at the yearly in
equalities exhibited in Tables and III, will show us that these are
                                               I
more marked and more regular in those years which correspond to
maximum sun-spots, than they are in years of minimum sun-spots.
        Note on the above Paper.                         By Professor G. G. STOKES.
  As the search for periodic inequalities of unknown period must
always be more or less laborious, it seems desirable to point out
another mode in which the search might be conducted, and which
seems to offer great facilities                for the object, assuming the possession
of the required instrument.
  It                                         of Sir William Thomson
        seems to me that the harmonic analyser
is singularly well       to this
                      adapted    purpose, which, as  have ascertained           I
from him, was one of the applications of his machine that he has had
in view.
  If f(t)  be any function of the time t given by observation, and
27- -n a period p assumed at pleasure, then by plotting if necessary
the function on a scale adapted to the paper cylinder of the machine.
we shall get, by a simple mechanical process, the values of the in
tegrals

between any limits.    We may take the inferior limit for the origin of
the time, and then  by reading off the cylinders of the machine for as
many values of the superior limit t as we please, we shall get the cor
responding values, as many as we like, of the integrals.
   Suppose, now, that f(t) contains a small term of the form
                                           c   sin (n't-H x),
where n is not much different from n, so that the period tried ap
proaches closely to the period p' of this inequality. The corresponding
part of the integrals will be—

 but a small coefficient in the  numerator, and having a denominator
 which is not small, may be left to take their chance with casual fluc
 tuations; but the terms divided by n' —n rise into importance from
 the smallness of the denominator, and express an inequality in the

   If, therefore, the values of these two integrals, obtained from the
two cylinders respectively, be plotted, we shall obtain a periodic fluc
tuation of a period more or less long as we hit on a period more or
less near to that of the inequality which we have supposed to exist.
The zero points of the fluctuation in the sine integral will correspond
to the maxima and minima in that of the cosine integral, and vice versä.

   A portion of this memoir is devoted to a discussion of a few points
raised in reference to the first memoir of the authors, on fired gun
powder, by General Morin and M. Berthelot, who were appointed by
the Académie des Sciences as a Commission to report on that memoir.
These points were specified and discussed by those savants in a joint
report, and in two separate memoirs communicated by M. Berthelot
to the Académie.
   The principal points to which attention has thus                       been drawn are as
follow :—
   1. Potassium hyposulphite        has been found as one of the products of
combustion of gunpowder by every recent investigator.                 But the
question arises: Is this product either wholly or in part primary? or
is it to be considered as secondary, formed from the primary products
during the rapid loss of heat to which they are exposed ? or is                                it,

tions expressing the chemical metamorphosis undergone by powder, at
least as far as regards its fundamental products.
   3. In directing attention to the determination by the authors of the
heat disengaged by the explosion of powder (the results of which
were put forward by them with some reserve), MM. Morin and
Berthelot regard the figure arrived at as too low, partly because of a
deficiency in delicacy of the apparatus, and partly because higher
figures have been arrived at by M. Tromenec and by MM. Roux and
 Sarrau.
   In discussing M. Berthelot's views respecting the objections which
the authors raise against the acceptance of any chemical equation as
giving even a general idea of the metamorphosis which a gunpowder
of average composition may be considered to undergo when exploded
in a confined space, they disclaim having had any intention to convey
the impression, which indeed they consider that their expressions were
not calculated to convey, that it was impossible to put into some form
of equation a representation of a variety of reactions which, if assumed
to take place simultaneously, among different proportions of the
powder-constituents, might give approximate expression to the results
obtained in any one particular experiment, and might, thus far, afford
some approach to a theoretical representation of the metamorphosis of
gunpowder.     What they desired to point out and lay stress upon was
the conclusive proof, which is afforded by the very great variations in
composition, of the solid portions more particularly, of the products of
explosion of samples of gunpowder presenting only small differences
of composition (and even of the products furnished at different times
by one and the same sample), that the reactions which occur among
the powder-constituents are susceptible of very considerable variations,
regarding the causes of which it appears only possible to form con
jectures, and that, consequently, “no value whatever can be attached
to any attempt to give a general chemical expression to the meta
morphosis of gunpowder of normal composition.”
   Starting with the assumption (which the authors cannot admit to
be a correct interpretation of their view) that they regard the varia
tions which occur in the principal products of explosion as “opposed
to all general chemical representation of the metamorphosis produced
by explosion,” M. Berthelot proceeds to argue that the formation of
those products, viz., of carbon dioxide, carbon oxide, potassium sul
phate, sulphide and carbonate from a powder of normal composition, is
simply and satisfactorily accounted for by assuming the simultaneous
occurrence, in variable proportions, of either three or four out of five
different theoretical reactions, according as to whether the proportion
of sulphate found is so small that it may be neglected, or amounts to
12 or 14 per cent.
   After giving further equations which apply to the extreme results

  (in regard to the chief products only)    assumed   to be attainable from
  the introduction, on the one hand of     excess  of saltpetre, on the other
 of  excess  of charcoal, into the composition of powder, M. Berthelot
  passes to what he terms the accessory products and, excluding from
  these potassium  hyposulphite, which he deals with separately, he first
 gives two equations to account for the production of sulphocyanide;
 then two more to explain the existence of ammonium sesqui-carbonate
  (which he believes to be formed by the action of water vapour on
 potassium cyanide); the existence of sulphuretted or free hydrogen is
 explained by two more equations, and marsh-gas is assumed to result
 from “the pyrogenous decomposition of the charcoal in the powder.”
 Lastly, an equation is given to account for the possible formation of
 traces of hyposulphite, which Berthelot however regards entirely as a
 product formed during the collection and analytical treatment of the
 solid residue, but which the authors nevertheless believe they now
 conclusively prove to be formed in very notable quantities before the
 solid residue can have undergone alteration from external causes.
    It will be seen from the foregoing outline of M. Berthelot's theo
 retical explanation of the chemical changes involved in the metamor
 phosis of gunpowder, that the simplest form of expression which he
 can give to the formation of the products of explosion consists in the
 incorporation of nine or ten distinct reactions, occurring simultaneously
 but in very variable proportions, which have to be supplemented by
 three or four other chemical equations, by which the formation, during
 the process of cooling of certain products believed to be secondary, is
explained.     Now, although such speculations as the above are un
questionably interesting, and, it may be added, of a nature which
 must occur to those who desire to give some kind of definite explana
 tion, for purposes of elementary instruction, of the chemical changes
involved in the explosion of powder, the authors fail to see that, beyond
this, they do more than afford the strongest confirmation of the cor.
rectness of their conclusion, that “no value whatever can be attached
to any attempt to give a general chemical expression to the metamor
phosis of a gunpowder of normal composition.”
    With reference to the potassium hyposulphite, which, in the
analyses of the solid products published in the first memoir, ranged
from 3 to 35 per cent. (the monosulphide being generally small in
amount when the proportion of hyposulphite was high), the authors
reply to M. Berthelot's suggestion, that its existence may be only
ascribable to the oxidation of sulphide during the operation of
removal from the explosion-vessel and of analysis, by pointing out the
nature of the precautions taken to avoid oxidation of sulphide in the
collection of the solid residue, and its preservation for analysis, and
by admitting the formation of some hyposulphite during the unavoid
able exposure to air of the residues while they were being removed

from the cylinder, especially in some instances when the structure of
the residue was favourable to atmospheric action, and when the
development of heat afforded proof of the occurrence of such oxida
tion. They point out, on the other hand, that no hyposulphite could
be accidentally formed from sulphide during the analytical operations
as carried out by them, and they proceed to show that the very con
siderable variations in the amount of hyposulphite, as well as the
large amount of sulphide found in several instances, in distinct
operations conducted with very great uniformity, afford substantial
proof that accidental atmospheric oxidation during the collection and
analysis of the residues, is not sufficient to account for all but the very
small quantities of hyposulphite which M. Berthelot considers could
only have pre-existed in the residue examined by the authors.
  They furthermore direct attention to the following facts given
in their first memoir, which appear to have been overlooked by
M. Berthelot.
   1. Separate examinations  (conducted precisely alike) of the upper
and lower  portions of some of the residues, showed that considerably
larger proportions of hyposulphite existed in the upper portions.   In
one case, quoted by them in their first memoir, the upper portion con
tained 17.14 per [cent of hyposulphite, while the lower portion only
contained 434 per cent. At the same time there was only a difference
of 1:27 per cent. in the proportions of monosulphide existing in the
two portions of the residue (6.03 in the upper part and 7.3 in the
lower), while there was a very great difference in the amount of free
sulphur (4.88 in the upper part and 10:09 in the lower).
  2. One of the small buttons of the fused solid products, of which
there was generally one found attached to the firing plug in the
cylinder, was examined for sulphide and hyposulphite      having been      (it

   (whether primary or secondary) is conclusively demonstrated by a
   thorough examination into the results given in their first memoir, they
   have been anxious to obtain, if possible, some further decisive
   evidence as to the probable proportions of hyposulphite actually exist
   ing in the residues furnished by the explosion of gunpowder in closed
   vessels.   They, therefore, introduced some variations in the methods
   of collecting and preparing the solid products for analysis, of which
   the following is an outline.         -
      In two   experiments with R.L.G. and pebble powders, the solid pro
   ducts, collected as rapidly as possible, were divided into two equal
  parts, the one consisting of the upper, the other of the lower, part of
  the mass. These portions were again equally divided; one-half, com
  posed of large lumps, was as rapidly as possible (being but a few
  moments exposed to air) sealed up in dry bottles freed from oxygen;
  the other half of each was ground finely and exposed to the air for
  forty-eight hours.
     In  both experiments the lower ground portion heated very decidedly
  more than the upper part, the tendency to heat being abnormally high
  in the case of the pebble residue; a thermometer inserted into the
  ground mass indicated a temperature of 315°C. After half an hour's
  exposure the deposit cooled very rapidly.
     The products obtained in these two experiments were submitted to
  partial examination, the chief object being to see to what extent the
  proportions of hyposulphite and sulphide varied in the upper and
  lower portions of the residue, and the extent to which they were
  affected by the great difference in the mode of treatment sustained by
  the different portions of one and the same residue.
     The numerical results obtained show that, in both experiments,
 those portions of the residue which were exposed to the air only for a
 few seconds, and of which but small surfaces were thus exposed (as
 they were collected in large lumps) contained hyposulphite ranging
 in amount from 5 to 8.5 per cent.           Those portions which were
 specially treated for the purpose of favouring to the utmost the
 formation of hyposulphite from sulphide through atmospheric agency,
 contained, as was to be expected, very large proportions of the former,
 while the latter had entirely disappeared in three out of the four
 portions of very finely pulverised residue. In the fourth, however,
even after its free exposure to air for forty-eight hours, there still
remained nearly 3 per cent of sulphide.           Now, as in no single
instance in the entire series of the experiments did any accidental
circumstances occur, which even distantly approached the special con
ditions favourable to the oxidation of the sulphide which were
introduced into these particular experiments, the authors consider
themselves justified in arriving at the conclusion, that the total
absence of sulphide in the residues furnished by the fine-grain powder

  in experiments  40, 42, and 47, was not due to accident in the mani
  pulations, and that, in those residues in the general series of analyses
  which were found to contain large quantities of hyposulphite (as in
  six out of  the nineteen experiments with pebble and R.L.G. powder,
  and  eight  out of the nine with F.G. powder) the greater proportion
  at any rate, of that hyposulphite existed in those particular residues
  before their removal from the explosion-vessel.
    In experiments which the authors have instituted with a sample of
 sporting powder and one of mining powder, the following course of
 proceeding was adopted for the removal of the solid residue from the
 explosion-vessels, and its preparation for analysis. Distilled water,
 which had been freed from air by long-continued boiling, was syphoned
 into the explosion-vessel when the latter had cooled, so that air was
 never allowed to come into contact with the solid residue.    When the
 cylinder was thus quite filled with water it was closed, and set aside
 for sufficient time to allow the residue to dissolve completely. The
 solution was then decanted into bottles freed from oxygen, which were
 quite filled with the liquid and carefully sealed up until required for
 analysis.
    The residues of the two experiments in which these special precau
 tions were adopted to guard against the possible accidental formation
 of hyposulphite were found to contain respectively 4 and 6 per cent of
that   substance.    In the series  of experiments with pebble powder
there were three, in that with R.L.G., powder four, while in that with
F.G. powder there was one, of which the residues contained propor
tions closely similar to those furnished by these two special experi
ments, there being no peculiarity in those seven experiments nor any
attendant circumstances which could be assigned as a possible reason
why the proportions of hyposulphite in those cases should be so much
lower than in the other experiments with the same powders carried
out under the same conditions.       The authors, therefore, cannot but
conclude that the production of a small or of a larger proportion of
hyposulphite (whether as a primary or secondary product, but before
the explosion-vessel is opened) is determined by some slight modifica
tion of the conditions attending the explosion itself.
    The sporting powder (Curtis and Harvey, No. 6) used by the
authors for the purpose of comparing the results of explosion with
those of the military powders used in these researches, did not differ
very widely in composition from these; the composition of the char
coal which it contained was intermediate between those contained in
the R.F.G. and F.G. powders. No striking points of difference were
exhibited between the proportions of the gaseous and solid products
which it furnished and those obtained with the four Service powders
used.    With the mining powder employed the case was very different.
This  powder   presented very important differences in composition from

    1879.]                  Researches on Explosives.                  131
    any of the other powders experimented with, as well as from those
   used by the recent experimenters referred to in the first memoir.
   The proportion of saltpetre was about 11 per cent. lower than in the
   military powders, while the proportions of charcoal and sulphur were
   higher by about one-half. The composition of the former was similar
   to that of the pebble powder charcoal. The carbonic oxide produced
   from this powder was double the highest amount furnished by any of
   the other powders, while the carbonic anhydride, which in the three
   series of experiments ranged from 45 to 53 per cent, amounted only
   to 32 per cent, the two gases existing in about equal proportions.
   Marsh-gas and hydrogen were present in unusually high proportions,
   and the sulphuretted hydrogen amounted to 7 per cent, being nearly
   double the highest proportion found in all the other experiments.
   The solid residue presented very interesting points of difference. The
  potassium carbonate was, as might have been anticipated, compara
  tively small in amount (though some of the experiments with F.G.
  powder gave similar results in this respect), but there was only 0:5
  per cent. of sulphate formed, while the monosulphide amounted to
  33 per cent.      Federow's experiments are the only ones in which so
  high a percentage of sulphide is recorded; and among the several
  experiments with R.L.G. powder, in which only small proportions of
  sulphate were formed, there was only one residue in which the free
  sulphur was as high in amount as that formed in the mining powder
  residue. The hyposulphite amounted to nearly 6 per cent.—2 per
  cent. more than was furnished by the sporting powder under precisely
  similar conditions of experiment, and double the smallest amount
  formed in any of the series of experiments conducted with the very
  special precautions which were applied in dealing with the residue
  of the powder under discussion. The ammonium sesqui-carbonate was
 considerably higher in amount than in any other experiments, and the
 potassium sulphocyanide amounted to 3 per cent, or about five times
 the amount found in any other experiment excepting that of Link.
 Lastly, there was a much more considerable amount of residual char
 coal in this experiment than in any other.
     The very distinctive peculiarities shown by the composition of the
 solid and gaseous products of this powder are generally such as would
 have been predicted from the comparatively small proportion borne by
 the oxidising agent to the oxidisable constituents in the mining powder.
     The experiments made with mining powder presented other features
of great interest in addition to those elicited by the chemical examina
tion of the products of explosion. In concluding their observations
on these, the authors point out that fresh confirmation is afforded by
this experiment of the fact that hyposulphite must be classed among
the invariable and more important products of explosion of gunpowder
in closed   spaces.

        132                Capt. Noble and Mr.   F. A. Abel.           [May 29,
           A  comparative examination of the highest, lowest, and mean pro
        portions of solid products furnished by the four military powders with
        which complete series of experiments (with charges ranging in gravi
        metric density from 0.1 to 0.9) were made, elicits various points of
        interest, for which reference must be made to the complete memoir.
           Before quitting this portion of the subject the authors refer to
        a statement appended to their memoir, in which they have given the
        results of the following calculations:—
           (1.) The amount of gaseous products, calculated from the data fur
        nished by the analysis of the solid products.
           (2.) The amount of solid products, calculated from the data fur
       nished by the analysis of the gaseous products.
           (3.) A comparison between the weights of the elementary sub
       stances found in the products of combustion and the weights of the
       same elements found in the powder prior to ignition.
           (4.) The weight of oxygen contained - in the total quantity of hypo
       sulphite found.
          An examination of this statement will show how closely accordant
       the various analyses, as a whole, are.
          A review of the comparison between the weight of oxygen origin
       ally in the powder and that found in the products after explosion,
       appears to show that there is in the latter, on the average, an appre
       ciable excess of oxygen.      Hence it may pretty fairly be concluded
       that a  portion  of the hyposulphite found is due to the oxidation of the
       monosulphide after removal from the explosion-vessel.
          On the other hand, a reference to those analyses in which hypo
       sulphite exists in large proportions shows that, were the whole of the
       hyposulphite assumed to be formed after the removal of the products
       from the cylinders, there would exist a large deficiency in oxygen,
       and very much larger than the existing excess.         Hence it may be
       equally fairly concluded from this line of argument that it is im
       possible to attribute to accidental causes the formation of the whole
       of the hyposulphite, and that a large proportion of it must be looked
       on either as a primary or secondary product.
          In passing to a consideration of the heat generated by the explosion
       of gunpowder, the authors point out that, in their first memoir, they
       themselves called attention to the inconvenience and to the errors likely
       to arise from the employment of the particular form of apparatus used,
       and that they were at the outset fully alive to the great advantages, in
       regard to saving of time and labour, as well as in respect of accuracy,
       which would result from the use of an apparatus of the kind since
       employed by them. But, as one of the chief objects of their experi
       ments was to ascertain whether the results of the metamorphosis        of
       gunpowder, when fired in considerable quantities and under tensions
       similar to those developed in the bores of guns, were at all similar   to

 1879.]                    Researches on Explosives.                           133
those occurring when small quantities are fired under feeble tensions,
 the original explosion-apparatus was designedly adopted in the earlier
stages of these experiments, so as to determine the heat generated
 when gunpowder is fired under high tensions, for which purpose
vessels of great strength and weight, and therefore not well suited for
calorimetric observations, were indispensable.
    A further investigation of this branch of the subject has shown,
however, that the difference between the authors' earlier determina
tions of heat and those of other experimenters referred to by MM.
Morin and Berthelot are due, not to errors in the former, but to
essential differences in the decomposition of different descriptions of
powder.
    In continuing their heat experiments the authors made use of two
explosion-vessels, similar in general form to the larger vessel described
in the first memoir, but of small capacity and weight.*              The specific
heats of both these vessels were      carefully  determined,    and the amount
of heat  absorbed    by the calorimeter for various changes of temperature
was also   carefully  determined.     Thermometers specially made for the
purpose, and capable of being read to 0°01 F. ("006 C.), were used in
these experiments.
    To determine the heat generated, a charge of from 150 to 200 grs.
 (9.72 to 12.96 grms.) in the smaller cylinder, of 400 grs. (2592 grms.)
in the larger cylinder was carefully weighed and placed in the explo
sion-vessel.   The explosion-vessel was then immersed in the water of
the calorimeter and the charge fired in the usual way, the attached
thermometer being read before the explosion and afterwards, continu
ously, until the maximum temperature (which was reached in from two
to three minutes) was attained.
    To make the new calorimetric determinations as complete as possi
ble, and with the view of exhibiting the differences in the heat evolved
due to differences in the composition of the powder, determinations
have been made of the heat given off by the three principal powders
described in the first memoir, and of three other powders differing
widely in their composition, and which have been made the subject of
analyses and experiments in these researches, viz.:—Ordinary English
mining, Curtis and Harvey's sporting powder, No. 6, and Spanish
                                   -
spherical powder.
    With the small explosion-vessel the mean results obtained (Experi
ments 146 to 166) were as follows, the numbers given below indicating
the gramme-units evolved by the combustion of 1 grim.             -  of each de
scription of powder employed.
   * One of these weighed 1,381 grms., having a capacity of 32.5 grims. ; the other
weighed 3,430 grms, and had a capacity of 118-83 grms.

    From the whole of           these experiments, and giving to the second

    From an examination of the whole of the results it is obvious:
 firstly, that the heat generated by the combustion of gunpowder is
 subject to very wide variations, dependent upon the particular nature
 of the powder employed (the Spanish powder for example generates
just 50 per cent. more heat than the mining powder); and, secondly,
that the heat evolved by the same description of powder varies in
 different experiments to a greater extent than is to be accounted for
by errors of observation. And this was indeed to be expected, since
the very considerable variations in the products of combustion under
the same circumstances, as disclosed by the analyses, would hardly be
supposed to exist without some corresponding variation in the heat
evolved.
    The authors’ views on this head are confirmed by calorimetric deter
minations in their researches on gun-cotton.             In these determinations,
which have been carried on with precisely the same apparatus, no
appreciable difference was found in the heat evolved in the various
experiments.               -
    The units of heat liberated, given          above, are those furnished      by the

 powders as actually used; but as these powders had different amounts
 of moisture in their composition, and as, in use, these amounts of
 moisture are found to vary considerably, giving rise, especially when
 the powders are used in guns, to very different pressures and generat
 ing very different energies, it has been considered desirable to correct
 the above figures, the following being those that would have had place
 had the powders, when fired, been perfectly free from moisture.

   The results given in this table are very striking. Taking the two
natures of powder which commence and close the list, the heat gene
rated by the Spanish powder is about 50 per cent. higher than that
generated by the mining powder, while the quantity of permanent
gases evolved by the latter is about 50 per cent, greater than that given
off by the former.
   Thus it appears that the great inferiority of heat developed by the
mining powder, as compared with the Spanish powder, is compensated,
or at least approximately so, by the great superiority in volume of
permanent gases produced. A similar relation is observed in respect
to the other powders, and it would indeed appear that the pressures at
any given density and the capacity for performing work of the various
powders are not very materially different.
   This fact has been entirely verified for the whole of the Waltham
Abbey powders, and in a less degree for the three other powders also.
   The peculiarities shown by the mining powder are so interesting
that it appeared important to determine its tension when fired under
a high gravimetric density.                    11,560 grs. (749 grms.) of this powder
have, therefore, been fired under a gravimetric density of unity.
The pressure developed by two very accordant observations was,
when corrected, 44 tons on the square inch (6,706 atmospheres). The
pressure obtained under similar circumstances from Waltham Abbey
powder was 43 tons on the square inch (6,554 atmospheres).
   It will afterwards be seen that the capacity for performing work of
the various descriptions of powder was also found to be not very
different, a similarity of result the more remarkable when it is remem.
bered that with, at all events, three of the powders there were striking
differences both in their composition and in the decomposition they
experience, and when in consequence material variations both in pres
sures at different densities and in potential energy might have been
expected.
   With respect to the great difference in heat evolved by the Spanish
and mining powders, it appears difficult to resist the conclusion that
the small number of units of heat evolved by the latter is in great
measure due to the quantity of heat absorbed in placing the very much

larger proportion of the products of combustion in the form of perma
nent gases.   This suggestion would also appear fully to explain the
fact alluded to in the authors' first paper, and to which they had
been led purely by experiment, namely, “that the variations observed
in the decomposition of gunpowder do not, even when very consider
able, materially affect either    tension           its

suffered five expansions during the motion of the projectile in the gun,
the gravimetric density of the charge being unity, the table shows that
for every pound or kilogramme in the charge an energy of 91.4 foot
tons, or 62,400 kilogrammetres will, as a maximum, be generated.
   If the factor of effect for the powder be known, the above values,
multiplied by that factor, will give the energy per pound or kilogramme
that may be expected to be realised in the projectile.
   But it rarely happens, especially with the very large charges used in
the most recent guns, that gravimetric densities so high as unity are
employed; in such cases from the total realisable energy must be
deducted the energy which the powder would have generated had it
expanded from a density of unity to that actually occupied by the
charge.
   Thus, in the instance above given, if we suppose the charge, instead
of a gravimetric density of unity, to have a gravimetric density of 8,
which corresponds to a volume of expansion of 1:25, we see from
 Table XI that from the 91.4 foot-tons, or 62,400 kilogrammetres, above
given, there must be subtracted 19.23 foot-tons, or 13,127.3 kilogram
metres, leaving 72.17 foot-tons, or 49,272.8 kilogrammetres, as the
maximum energy realisable under the given conditions per pound, or
per kilogramme, of the charge.
   As before, these values must be multiplied by the factor of effect to
obtain the energy realisable in the projectile.
   The authors then discuss the       causes which in the bore of a gun
affect the energy  realised by gunpowder,   and point out that this energy
varies  very  much with the     powders   employed, being in this respect
dependent upon circumstances, such as the density of the powder, its
size of grain, the amount of moisture, chemical composition, nature of
 charcoal used, &c., &c., but that the energy may also vary considerably
 even with the same powder, if the charges be not fired under precisely
the same circumstances.      For example, especially with slow burning
powders, the weight of the shot fired exerts a very material influence
upon the factor of effect, and the reason is obvious: the slower the
shot  moves at first, the earlier in its passage up the bore is the charge
entirely consumed, and the higher is the energy realised. The same
effect, unless modified by other circumstances, is produced when the
charge is increased with the same weight of projectile.       In this case
the projectile has to traverse a greater length of bore before the same
relief due to expansion is attained. The higher pressures which con
sequently rule react upon the rate of combustion of the powder, and
again a somewhat higher energy is obtained.
   Both these increased effects, of course, correspond to an increased
initial tension of the powder-gases, but, especially with the smaller
guns, a very great difference in the realised energy may arise from
other causes.

   Such causes, affecting the energy realised, are then discussed, and
in particular the authors draw attention to the effect of retaining the
shot in its seat for a greater or less time, thus giving rise in the former
case to a more perfect and earlier combustion of the charge. They
cite experiments to show that from this cause alone differences of
energy, in guns having a calibre of 12 centims of 13 to 14 per cent.
have been obtained.
   They add that in cases where the projectile has been removed for a
considerable distance from the charge, that              when there           is,

   In   the year 1865, Dr. Oscar Liebreich published an important
 paper*   upon a new proximate principle which he had separated from
 the brain.  Unlike the numerous bodies, possessed of ill-defined pro
 perties which had, by different writers, received the names of
 cerebrin, cerebric acid, lecithine, or phosphorized fats, this new body
 could be extracted by an easy process in a state of purity, and
 to  it,probably     indicating

   Protagon is soluble with difficulty in cold, but more easily in warm
alcohol and ether.      At higher temperatures than 55° C., alcohol
appears to decompose protagon.       In water protagon swells and pre
sents the appearance of an opaque jelly, ultimately dissolving so as to
form an opaque solution.     Liebreich found that protagon was soluble
in glacial acetic acid, which deposited it again in a crystalline form,
when subjected to the action of cold.
   When boiled with a solution of barium hydrate protagon is
decomposed, yielding glycerin—phosphoric       acid, fatty acids of which
he isolated stearic acid      state of purity, and a base to which he
                                     in   a
gave the name of neurine, and to the platinum compound of which he
ascribed the formula C5H11NCl3Pt.    This base was afterwards shown
to be identical with the base which Strecker had separated from bile
and termed choline.
   Although the absolute accuracy of a large number of Liebreich's
facts has been placed beyond question, the cardinal fact itself—that
protagon is a definite phosphorized principle contained in nervous
matter—has come to be universally denied.
   By Diaconow, Hoppe-Seyler, and Thudichum it is denied that any
such definite substance exists, and Liebreich's protagon is held to be
a mechanical admixture of a phosphorized body termed lecithin,
C. HooMPO, with a nitrogenous, non-phosphorized, body termed cere
brin. The presence of phosphorus in protagon is said to be due to
contamination with lecithin, and in support of this view it is alleged
that by extracting protagon with ether, the substance loses more
and more phosphorus;      according to Diaconow and Hoppe-Seyler's
admission, the phosphorus does adhere most obstinately and cannot be
entirely got rid of, though Dr. Thudichum thinks he has, by mere
extraction with ether, obtained cerebrin (or cerebrines) quite free from
phosphorus.             -
   It is not our intention in this communication to enter into a
full criticism of the views of those who have preceded         us in the
investigation  of the existence or non-existence of    protagon, and we
shall confine ourselves to a statement of a few of the chief objections
which appeared to us as insurmountable obstacles in the way of
accepting Diaconow's and Hoppe-Seyler's statements.

sistence of a thin milk and then boiling; a precipitate forms, which is
extracted with boiling alcohol.               On cooling, the fluid deposits an
abundant precipitate; this is treated with ether, to separate choles
terin and fats, and then recrystallized from boiling alcohol. Of this
body Müller published two analyses, which led him to assign to it the
formula C3H3NO6.              It is described by Hoppe-Seyler as a light,
white, highly hygroscopic powder.”
   But what right have we to assume that a body obtained by boiling
so complex an organic mixture as a brain with caustic baryta is a
proximate principle of the brain, i.e., that it exists preformed in the
brain? The surmise is as bold as it is improbable.
   Lecithin is described by Diaconow himself as a non-pulverizable,
yellowish-white, highly hygroscopic body.t               Is it not strange that two
usually amorphous highly hygroscopic bodies should, when mixed, give
rise to a constantly crystallizable absolutely non-hygroscopic mixture?
And this is exactly what would be the case were the hypotheses of
Diaconow and Hoppe-Seyler correct.
   According to Diaconow, by repeated extractions with ether, the P
contained in protagon may be made to sink to 1 per cent., whereas,
according to Liebreich's formula, it should contain 1:5 per cent.
Actually, in the three           determinations which he made, Liebreich
obtained     1:1,  1:1, and 1:5,  as the amount of phosphorus in 100 parts,
but, unfortunately, he seems to have concluded that the highest number
was correct and made it the basis of his calculation.
   In the year 1877, one of us, assisted by Mr. Leopold Larmuth,
Platt Physiological Scholar, commenced in the Physiological Laboratory
of Owens College, a series of experiments intended to determine whether
Liebreich's protagon existed or not. This preliminary investigation
showed that by Liebreich's process there is always obtained a body
having the physical properties of protagon, and containing phosphorus
in a proportion sufficiently near to that indicated by him; it was found
that the amount of phosphorus in specimens of protagon which had
been crystallized from alcohol four or five times, was not smaller than
that present in protagon which had only once been crystallized, though
a thorough treatment with ether preceded each recrystallization.
    These first experiments so far as they went, were perfectly satis
factory.      It  appeared, however, quite essential, before forming a
definite opinion, to extend them very considerably and especially to

and then by filtration, the substance left undissolved by it was first of
all dried between sheets of filtering paper in air, and afterwards over
sulphuric acid or phosphorus pentoxide. The resulting mass, which
had a snow-white colour, was reduced to powder, moistened with a
little water, and digested for many hours with alcohol heated to 45° C.
From the filtered liquid, if this be allowed to cool very gradually, the
protagon separates in the form of microscopic crystals, mostly arranged
in rosettes, the appearance and arrangement of which differs somewhat,
as Liebreich very exactly pointed out, according to the degree of con
centration of the solution.       The once crystallized protagon thus ob
tained was collected on a       filter, washed with ether, and dried first of
all in air and ultimately       over P.O.5. It was then recrystallized as
many times as required, the process always commencing by pulverizing
and thoroughly shaking with cold ether.
    It appeared to us of special importance not merely to subject to
ultimate analysis several different samples of protagon, but specially
to subject to ultimate analysis protagon after the second crystalliza
tion, and the same protagon after being recrystallized a third time.
    In our analyses the C and H were determined by combustions made
with lead chromate, with an abundance of reduced copper in the fore
part of the combustion tube. The N determinations were made by
Dumas' method, the phosphorus was determined in some cases by
Carius's method, in others by fusion with sodium carbonate and salt
petre.    The results of every combustion, save two, in which unavoid
able accidents occurred, are given below.

appears in many problems relating to the flexure of solids, and has
besides a kind of historical interest in virtue of Poisson’s erroneous
conclusion that    it must   be #  for all bodies.
   Various methods      have been     employed to measure the ratio.      The
most obvious      perhaps   after direct measurement (which is      obviously
only applicable to a very small class of bodies) is to compare the
times of longitudinal and torsional vibration of a wire or cylinder of

                                     2V: where V, and W, are the velocities
of the vibrations which depend on           q and n respectively, it is easily
seen that   large  errors   may   appear   in the value deduced for a when
only comparatively small errors are made in the measurement of
V, and W, and besides this it is not unlikely that the q and n deter
mined by vibrations, when there is not time for the heat caused by the
strain to alter its distribution by conduction, may not be the same as
when determined by statical methods. Wertheim made use of tubes
closed at one end and filled with water, the surface of which appeared
in a capillary tube fixed at the other end. The necessary data were
obtained by subjecting the tubes to longitudinal strain, and observing
the extension produced by it and the depression of the water in the
capillary tube. Kirchhoff has employed an ingenious method in the
case of brass and steel rods.
   It depended on observing simultaneously the torsion and flexure
produced by hanging a weight on an arm attached in a horizontal
plane at right angles to one end of the rod, the other end of the rod
being fixed in a horizontal position.
   His experiments seem to have been made with every precaution
against error, and the values he deduces for u are 294 for steel and
 387 for brass, both of which are larger than the values found in my
experiments on the same metals.
   This may be attributed in part, at any rate, to the fact that
Kirchhoff used hardened steel and drawn brass rods, whereas most of
my specimens were annealed.
   The method which       I have employed has some advantages over these,
especially in this that it is applicable to almost every solid, no matter
how brittle it may be, or how narrow are its limits of elasticity.
   It depends on the proposition that when a rectangular bar with
plane sides is bent by opposing couples whose planes are parallel to
one pair of sides, the other pair become surfaces of uniform anti-elastic
curvature,    with   principal radii of curvature      R and  +.     provided
that R is large compared with the third proportional to the thickness
and breadth of the bar. (See Thomson and Tait “Nat. Phil.,” $716.)

    On one side of a rectangular bar, fig. 1, of the substance for which
Au is to be measured, and about the middle of its length, a circle is
described of diameter nearly equal to the breadth of the bar.
Diameters are drawn in this circle parallel and perpendicular to the
length of the bar, and at their extremities fine holes are drilled
normal to the surface. (The dimensions of these holes are so small
compared to those of the bar, that they do not sensibly affect the
flexure.)   Four fine steel wires of equal length are planted firmly in
these holes, and their free ends are then bent together so that they
may all be in the field of a microscope at the same time. The bar is
then placed in a frame of which fig. 2 is a section.

a spherical head fitting into a spherical cavity in bb' at C, and C is
exactly half-way between A and A', and B and B'. When the bar is
bent in this frame by turning the screw D, the bending is accom
plished by pure, equal, and opposite couples; for since AA'BB' are
rollers and free to turn, there can be no tractions along the face of
the bar, and therefore the pressures are normal to the surface, and the
couples are equal in virtue of the equality of the distances AC A'C
and   BC BC.    Thus for that part of the bar between B and B the
radii of curvature R1 and R2 are constant, except in so far as they may
be affected by the surface distribution of pressure at B and B' which
as may readily       be seen by the transverse section fig. 3, would tend

effect produced by this cause must be quite insignificant towards the
middle of the bar. The whole frame aa' is mounted on a platform
with screw motions parallel and perpendicular to the length of the
bar, and the free ends of the wires are focussed in a fixed microscope,

make R1 vary   from 200 inches   upwards.    The dimensions of the bars
employed were about 8% 1 x 25 inches, so that the third proportional
to the thickness, breadth (viz., 4 inches), fulfils the condition of being
small compared to R. In fact,                           I
                                     found that much larger curvatures

      the investigation the method of images is followed, and is based
on the following lemma. The “image” of a source in an infinite fluid
in presence of a sphere consists of a source at the inverse point of the
former, and a line sink thence to the centre of the sphere.          the                                         If

across the boundary.    In this case the analysis would give an infinite
term for a single source, which, when the quantity of source and sink
is zero, disappears. The image for a source would be as before a source

It is this last which produces the infinite term. From these lemmas
are deduced the images of “doublets,” by which are meant the singular
points resulting from the coalescence of an equal source and sink whose
magnitude varies inversely as the distance between them.      It is easily
seen that when the axis of a doublet passes through the centre of the
sphere,     imageits   single doublet within

    These difficulties are principally created by overlapping images—
 due partly to residuary aberrations both spherical and chromatic–
 partly to the effects of diffraction, caused by brilliant illuminations of
 spurious disks of light—partly to the constant development of Eidola
 or false images, which vary the loci of their development according to
 the nature of underlying structures and according to the object
 glasses being over or under corrected; and they are partly, and indeed
 very considerably, created by the use of excessively large angular
 apertures.
    The paper discusses also, the relative effects on visibility, of large
 and small angular apertures in objectives.
    It shows that the black margins or black marginal annuli of refract
 ing spherules, constantly displayed by low aperture glasses, are
 attenuated gradually to invisibility as the glasses employed are
 endowed with the largest apertures. That the black margins also of
 cylinders, tubules, or semi-tubules suffer similar obliterations.      And
that, in consequence, innumerable minute details are concealed or
 destroyed till the aperture is sufficiently reduced.
    That minute refracting bodies obey the laws of their refrangibilities
and display beautiful phenomena, discoverable by transcendent
powers of definition; but totally unseen by inferior compensations.
And that, in consequence, the so-called achromatism of modern glasses
is an illusory approximation to correct vision.
    Examples are given of molecular structures, varying in form, trans
 lucency, and refrangibility, in which natural pencils are caught and
 displayed in the order in which, as in a rain drop, iridescent rays are
 emitted by the decomposed light.
    Several examples are also introduced, in which a high order of
lenticular correction beautifully discovers structure hidden, according
to Dr. Carpenter, F.R.S., from the great bulk of observers.
   As the paper deals so often with magnitudes very much less than
the 1–100,000th of an inch, a method is introduced of readily
estimating roughly such magnitudes between the 1-80,000th and the
1–500,000th of an inch, by means of a micrometer gauge.                 The
writer has been emboldened to grapple with these difficult minutiae, in
consequence of the sharp and clear definition he has attained of spider
lines miniatured down to the fourteenth part of a hundred-thousandth
of an inch. The eye, accustomed to contemplate this subtlety of
form, readily appreciates the one-fourth or sixth of this size, i.e.,

   The writer has also ventured to bring before the notice of the Royal
Society, a new test for the microscope, displaying bright lines of
uniform thickness less than the 1–100,000th, and sharp black lines of
much less tenuity than those given by Nobert's celebrated       lines ruled
on glass, and incomparably more easy of illustration.

    The employment of various fluids for immersion lenses is carefully
considered; and the singular property of castor oil discovered by the
writer is referred to.
    As the Society honoured the writer by inserting in their “Trans
actions” a paper on     “A   Searcher for Aplanatic Images,” he now
introduces a new form which offers some advantages: by its extended
traverse, by its simplicity and economy of light with increase of magni
fying power.
    Finally, some examples are given of producing transcendent defini
tion in cases found hopeless by a numerous body of observers; as the
papers written in “The Monthly Microscopical Journal” during the
last ten years abundantly demonstrate.    The means also of its attain
ment are    minutely described.
VII. “Note      on “Spectroscopic Papers.”         By G. D. LIVEING,
       M.A., Professor of Chemistry, and J. DEWAR, M.A., F.R.S.,
       Jacksonian Professor, University of Cambridge.          Received

    In  a recent   communication to the Royal Society, Mr. Lockyer
has criticised our statement of Young's wave-length identifications
of certain chromospheric lines. As to the wave-length, we have
throughout our table omitted all figures after the decimal point
 merely for the sake of not cumbering the table.           The numbers,
Young tells us, are not his own, but taken from Angström's cata
logue.      Moreover, as to Young's identifications with metallic lines,
he states expressly that they were taken from the maps of Kirchhoff,
 Angström, and Thalén, and Watts's “Index of Spectra.”           But our
 object was not to criticise Young's work, but only to use it for the
 purpose of comparing the behaviour of certain metals on the earth
 and in the sun, and the conditions under which certain lines appear,
 or do not appear, or are reversed.
     We should perhaps have made our meaning clearer if we had given
 another column with the wave-lengths of the metallic lines referred to
 side by side with Young's numbers for the chromospheric lines. We
 mentioned, in relation to aluminium, the two lines with wave-lengths
 624.54 and 6237.3 seen by Young, not because we thought their
 identity with the aluminium lines proved, but because they are the
 only two lines in Young's table which are at all close to aluminium
 lines, and if they be not due to that metal, then we have the remark
 able fact that aluminium in the sun gives no lines either dark or bright
 except the two which have been reversed on the earth. A somewhat
 similar remark applies to the potassium lines, only in that case
 Young's line has a wave-length very nearly the mean of the two

potassium lines which are often seen as one, not merely from want of
dispersive power (which with prisms is usually sufficient at the violet
end), but because the lines are expanded until they meet. We at
first saw them reversed as one broad line which divided in two as the
potassium evaporated.
   Mr. Lockyer complains that we omitted to refer to his work on the
wave-length of the potassium lines. In our first communication on
the subject of reversals we named at the outset those who had been
previously engaged in the same field, and after referring to their work
in general terms we did not think it desirable subsequently to notice
the specific results obtained by each individual. As neither the exist
ence of the two potassium lines nor the exact determination of their
wave-lengths, but only the identification of the dark lines we ob
served with the bright lines was in question, we considered it un
necessary to mention specially Mr. Lockyer's work on those lines.
   We owe it to the Society to explain the value which is to be
attached to the wave-lengths mentioned by us. We have never set
ourselves to determine exact wave-lengths; but we sought to deter
mine the conditions of reversal, and we used wave-lengths for the
convenience of indicating the lines of which we wrote.          In very
few cases have we      given  any  determinations of  wave-lengths.  In
general we determined the identity of a dark line with the cor
 responding bright line by observing that both had the same place
on the cross-wires, or pointer, or both gave the same reading of
 the scale of the spectroscope.   We then gave the wave-length of the
 bright line as determined by some good authority, usually either
Thalén or Boisbaudran.       When we could not identify the dark lines
in that  way,  we took the readings of known lines with our spectro
scope, using, for lack of sunshine, most frequently Boisbaudran's
method and wave-lengths, and having drawn a curve, determined the
wave-lengths of the dark lines therefrom.     It was in this way that we
obtained the   wave-lengths  of the two dark lines we ascribed to potas
sium. It       is,course, just within the bounds
                     of                                possibility that the

Thalén and that given by Boisbaudran for the bright line to which we
assume it to correspond, it was determined in the way above described,
and must not be taken to have more importance.      By our method of
working, the very high dispersive power required for the specific
identification of any substance by the determination of an individual
wave-length is avoided; as we depend on the greatly diminished
likelihood of error when several groups of lines of the same substance
are seen to be continually present at the time of one or more reversals.
It was the necessity of being able to rapidly sweep the entire spectrum
for the above purpose that caused us to limit the dispersion.
A large majority of the wave-lengths given by Thalén were obtained
by means of the moderate dispersion of one bisulphide of carbom prism,
a less dispersion than we have used; and it would be incorrect to
suppose that no enduring work in this field of spectroscopy can be
effected except with the enormous dispersive power which Mr. Lockyer
recommends.
VIII. “The       Determination of the Secular Effects of Tidal          Friction
      by a Graphical Method.” By G. H. DARWIN, M.A., formerly
      Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Communicated by
      J. W. L. GLAISHER, M.A., F.R.S. Received May 31, 1879.
   Suppose an attractive particle or satellite of mass m to be moving
in a circular orbit, with an angular velocity Q, round a planet of mass
M, and suppose the planet to be rotating about an axis perpendicular
to the plane of the orbit, with an angular velocity n; suppose, also,
the mass of the planet to be partially or wholly imperfectly elastic or
viscous, or that there are oceans on the surface of the planet; then
the attraction of the satellite must produce a relative motion in the
parts of the planet, and that motion must be subject to friction, or, in
other words, there must be frictional tides of some sort or other.
The   system must accordingly be losing energy by friction, and its
configuration must change in such a way that                its
                                                     whole energy

         It will be supposed
                         that the figure of the planet and the distribution
 of its internal density are such that the attraction of the satellite causes
 no couple about any axis perpendicular to that of rotation.

inertia with an angular velocity Q, and, therefore, the                                                                      m.          of    m.    of

which is   twice the energy of the system; so that the axis of     Y may
be called  the axis of energy.   Then, as it will be convenient to exhibit
all three  curves in the same figure, with a parallel axis of z, we must
have the   axis of energy identical with that of rotational momentum.
   It will not be necessary to consider the case where the resultant m.
of m. h is negative, because this would only be equivalent to reversing
all the rotations; thus h is to be taken as essentially positive.
   Then the line of momentum, whose equation is (6), is a straight
line at 45° to either axis, having positive intercepts on both axes.
   The curve of rigidity, whose equation is (8), is clearly of the same
nature as a rectangular hyperbola, but having a much more rapid rate
of approach to the axis of orbital momentum than to that of rotational
momentum.

gives the configuration where the satellite is closer to the planet. W
have already learnt that these two correspond respectively to minimu
and maximum energy.
   When x is very large, the equation to the curve of energy
Y=(h—a)”, which is the equation to a parabola, with a vertical a.
parallel to Y and distant h from the origin, so that the axis of t
parabola passes through the intersection of the line of momentu
with the axis of orbital momentum.

  Hence, the axis of          Y   is asymptotic on both sides to the curve
energy.
   Then, if the line of momentum intersects the curve of rigidity, t
curve of energy has a maximum vertically underneath the point
intersection nearer the origin, and a minimum underneath the poi
more remote. But if there are no intersections, it has no maximu
or minimum.
  It  is not easy to exhibit these curves well if they are drawn to sca
without making a figure larger than it would be convenient to pri.
and accordingly fig. 1 gives them as drawn with the free hand.         .
the zero of  energy  is quite arbitrary, the origin  for the energy cur
is displaced downwards, and this prevents the two curves from cros
ing one another in a confusing manner. The same remark appli
also to figs. 2 and 3.
  Fig.   1is erroneous principally in that the curve of rigidity oug
to approach its horizontal asymptote much more rapidly, so that
would be difficult in a drawing to scale to distinguish the points
intersection B and D.
   Fig. 2 exhibits the same curves, but drawn to scale, and design
to be applicable to the case of the earth and moon, that is to sa
when   h-4 nearly.
  Fig.   3 shows the curves when         h-1, and when
                                                  the line of momentu
does not intersect  the curve of rigidity; and here there is no max
mum or minimum in the curve of energy.
   These figures exhibit all the possible methods in which the bodi
may move with given moment of momentum, and they differ in t
fact that in figs. 1 and 2 the biquadratic (5) has real roots, but
the case of fig. 3 this is not so. Every point of the line of momentu
gives by         its
             abcissa and ordinate the square root               of

if the  moon-earth system were started with less than #5 of its actual
moment of momentum, it would not be possible for the two bodies to
move so that the earth should always show the same face to the moon.
    Again if we travel along the line of momentum there must be some
 point for which ya” is a maximum, and since          y"=#    there must be
some point for which the number of planetary rotations is greatest
during one revolution of the satellite, or shortly there must be some
configuration for which there is a maximum number of days in the
month.
    Now   ya”  is equal to a”(h—a), and this is a maximum when c=#h
and the maximum number of days in the month is (#h)” (h-#h) or
33
44
   h"; if  h is equal to 4, as is nearly the case for the homogeneous earth
and moon, this becomes 27.
    Hence it follows that we now have very nearly the maximum
number of days in the month. A more accurate investigation in my
paper on the “Precession of a Viscous Spheroid,” showed that taking
account of solar tidal friction and of the obliquity to the ecliptic the
maximum number of days is about 29, and that we have already
passed through the phase of maximum.
    We will now consider the physical meaning of the several parts of
the figures.
   It will be supposed that the resultant moment of momentum of the
whole system corresponds to a clockwise rotation.
   Now imagine two points with the same abscissa, one on the
momentum line and the other on the energy curve, and suppose the
one on the energy curve to guide that on the momentum line.
   Then since we are supposing frictional tides to be raised on the
planet, therefore the energy must degrade, and however the two
points are set initially, the point on the energy curve must always
slide down a slope carrying with it the other point.
   Now looking at fig. 1 or 2, we see that there are four slopes in the
energy curve, two running down to the planet, and two others which
run down to the minimum.           In fig. 3 on the other hand there are
only two slopes, both of which run down to the planet.
   In the first case there are four ways in which the system may
degrade, according to the way it was started; in the second only two
ways.
   i. Then in fig. 1, for all points of the line of momentum from C
through E to infinity, a is negative and y is positive; therefore this
indicates an anti-clockwise revolution of the satellite, and a clockwise
rotation of the planet, but the m. of m. planetary rotation is greater
than that of the orbital motion. The corresponding part of the curve
of energy slopes uniformly down, hence however the system be started,

 the equilibrium breaks down by the satellite receding, the recession
 will go on until the system has reached the state corresponding to B.
  * The point P, in fig. 2, shows approximately the present state of the
earth and moon, viz., when c=3:2, y="8.
    It is clear that, if the point l, which indicates that the satellite is
just touching the planet, be identical with the point A, then the two
 bodies are in effect part of a single body in an unstable configuration.
 If therefore, the moon was originally part of the earth, we should
 expect to find A and l identical.      The figure 2, which is drawn to
represent the earth and moon, shows that there is so close an approach
between the edge of the shaded band and the intersection of the line of
momentum and curve of rigidity, that it would be scarcely possible to
distinguish them on the figure. Hence, there seems a considerable
probability that the two bodies once formed parts of a single one,
which broke up in consequence of some kind of instability. This view is
confirmed by the more detailed consideration of the case in the paper
on the “Precession of a Viscous Spheroid,” of which only an abstract
has as yet been printed.
    Hitherto the satellite has been treated as an attractive particle, but
the graphical method may be extended to the case where both the
satellite and planet are spheroids rotating about axes perpendicular to
                                                 -
the plane of the orbit.
    Suppose, then, that k is the ratio of the moment of inertia of the
satellite to that of the planet, and that z is equal to the angular velocity
of the satellite round its axis, then kz is the moment of momentum of
the satellite's rotation, and we have
          h=a+y+kz for the equation to the plane of momentum,
          2=y+K+- '. for        the equation of energy,
                         ac
and   a "y=1, a”z=1 for the equation to the line of rigidity.
    The most convenient form in which to put the equation to the
                                               -
surface of energy is

                                       (h-y-k2)”
where E, y, z are the three ordinates.
    The best way of understanding the surface is to draw the contour
lines of energy parallel to the plane of y2, as shown in fig. 4.
    The case which      I  have considered may be called a double-star
system, where the planet and satellite are equal and k=1. Any other
case may be easily conceived by a stretching or contraction of the
surface parallel to 2.
    It will be found that, if the whole moment of momentum h has
less   than a certain critical value (found        by the consideration  that

 a”-ha” +2=0 has equal roots), then the surface may be conceived as
an infinitely narrow and deep ravine, opening out at one part of its
course into rounded valleys on each side of the ravine. In this case
the contours would resemble those of fig. 4, supposing the round closed
curves to be absent. The course of the ravine is at 45° to the axes of
y and 2, and the origin is situated in one of the valleys, which is less
steep than the valley facing it on the opposite side of the ravine. The
form of a section perpendicular to the ravine is such       as the curve of
energy    in  fig. 3,  so that everywhere there is a slope towards the
ravine.

that point must always slide down hill.      It does not, however, neces
sarily follow that it will always slide down the steepest path. The fall
of the guiding point into the ravine indicates the falling together of
the two stars.
    Thus,if the two bodies be started with less than a certain moment
of momentum, they must ultimately fall together.
   Next, suppose the whole m. of m. of the system to be greater than
the critical value. Now, the less steep of the two valleys of the
former case (viz., the one in which the origin lies) has become more
like a semicircular amphitheatre of hills, with a nearly circular lake at
the bottom; and the valley facing the amphitheatre has become merely
a falling back of the cliffs which bound the ravine. The energy curve
in fig. 2 would show a section perpendicular to the ravine through the
middle of the lake.                                               -
  The origin is nearly in the centre of the lake, but slightly more
remote from the ravine than the centre.
    In this figure         h was taken as 4, and k as             unity,  it represents
                                                                           so that
a system of equal double stars.                      The numbers written on each con
tour give the value of E corresponding to that contour.
   Now, the guiding point of the system, if on the same side of the
ravine as the origin, may either slide down into the lake or into the
ravine. If it falls into the ravine, the two stars fall together, and if to
the bottom of the lake, the whole system moves round slowly, like a
rigid body.
   If the point be on the lip of the lake, with the ravine on one side
and the lake on the other, this corresponds to the motion of the two
bodies rapidly round one another, moving as a rigid body; and this
state is clearly dynamically unstable.
   If the point be on the other side of the ravine, it must fall into                                     it,
and the two stars fall together.
    Ithas been remarked that the guiding point does not necessarily
slide down     the steepest gradient, and          such     modeof     descent
                                                                           a                   of

we have most probably found the state where the satellite first had
a separate existence.
   The conditions of stability of a rotating mass of fluid are very
obscure, but it seems probable that, if the stability broke down and
the mass gradually separated into two parts, then the condition im
mediately after separation might be something like the unstable
configuration described above.

   In conclusion, will add a few words to show that the guiding point
on an energy surface need not necessarily move down the steepest path,
but may even depart from the bottom of a furrow or move along
a ridge.    Of this two cases will be given.
   The satellite will now be again supposed to be merely an attractive
                                                -
particle.
   First, with given moment of momentum, the energy is greater when
the axis of the planet is oblique to the orbit.               Hence, if we draw
an  energy   surface in which one of the co-ordinate axes corresponds to
obliquity, then there must be a furrow in the surface corresponding to
zero obliquity. To conclude that the obliquity of the ecliptic must
diminish in consequence of tidal friction would be erroneous. In fact,
it will appear, in my paper on the “Precession of a Viscous Spheroid,”
that for a planet of small viscosity the position of zero obliquity is
dynamically     unstable,   if  the period of the satellite is greater than
twice that of the planet's rotation.         Thus the guiding point, though
always descending on the energy surface, will depart from the bottom
of the furrow.
   Secondly.    For given moment of momentum the energy is less               if
the orbit be eccentric,     and an energy surface may be constructed in
which zero eccentricity                                             I
                             corresponds to a ridge. Now, believe that         I
shall be able to show,       in a future paper, that for small viscosity of
the planet the circular     orbit is dynamically stable if eighteen periods
of the satellite be less than eleven periods of the planet's rotation.
This will afford a case of the guiding point sliding down a ridge;
when, however, the critical point is passed, the guiding point will
depart from the ridge and the orbit become eccentric.

according to the most valuable evidence we possess," appear to be
entirely the same. We, therefore, thought it very advisable to inquire
on what terms they might prove to be mutually equivalent: and the
particular equivalence we have examined has been equivalent pre
cipitability of the sulphates, by sodic hydrate, from an aqueous
solution.
                           I. Preparation of the Salts.
   The pure cobaltous salt      was prepared by converting        some excellent
commercial crystallized chloride into luteochloride, the process em
ployed having been already described by one of us.'t                  The luteo
chloride was     purified   by  precipitation  with  hydric    chloride,  and the
mixture of oxides it left behind on ignition was evaporated with re
distilled hydric sulphate.
    The pure nickelous salt was prepared from a sample of nickelous
chloride which contained copper, lime, and iron, but no cobalt. The
copper present was precipitated with hydric sulphide, and the nickel
in the filtrate was precipitated by hydric oxalate, in an acid solution.
The nickelous oxalate was washed thoroughly with dilute hydric
nitrate, ignited, and the oxide so formed            heated   with pure hydric
sulphate, and so converted into sulphate.
                II.  Method   of separating   Nickel from Cobalt.
    We had next to select a method for the quantitative separation of
nickel from cobalt. The first to which we had recourse was Liebig’s,'
which consists in adding hydric cyanide and potash to the mixed
saline solutions, thereby forming nickelopotassic cyanide and potassic
 cobalticyanide: these new compounds are boiled with freshly pre
 cipitated mercuric oxide, which throws down the nickel as oxide and
 cyanide. The cobalt in the filtrate is then precipitated as mercurous
 cobalticyanide.      On the ignition of these precipitates, nickelous oxide
 and cobaltic oxide are respectively left behind.             We converted the
 oxides into sulphates and weighed them as such. (Throughout the
 whole of these experiments the nickel and cobalt were always weighed
 as sulphates.)       We found, however, that after the expulsion, by
 ignition, of the mercury in the precipitates, the oxides were left in so
 dense and compact a state, that it was only with the greatest difficulty
 that they could be converted into sulphates.                To remedy this, a
 weighed quantity of pure baric sulphate was added to the liquid
 before precipitation; the precipitate, becoming mixed with the baric
 sulphate, was thus spread over a large surface, so that the oxide was
 obtained in a finely divided state, and easily converted into sulphate.

   In the experiments with this process, the nickel was invariably
found too high. This was at first thought to be due to alkali which
might cling to the precipitated oxide; and, on testing, some potash
was actually found in the precipitate, which had been thoroughly
washed. To remove this source of error, the nickelous sulphate,
instead of being weighed as such, was dissolved in water, excess of
ammonia added, and the nickel deposited on a platinum crucible, by
means of two Grove’s cells.
     But the nickel         was,    with this method, still found                        too   high, and we
then thought that the separation had not been perfect. On testing the
deposit, a considerable amount of cobalt was, in fact, found in        and                                it,

 then added, and the lead precipitated with hydric sulphate and alcohol.
 The filtrate from the plumbic sulphate was then evaporated to dryness,
 heated till the excess of hydric sulphate was driven off, and dissolved
 in water. A little hydric sulphide was then added, to remove a small
 quantity of lead still present, the filtrate evaporated to dryness, and
 the cobaltous sulphate weighed.               The plumbic peroxide must, of
 course, be perfectly pure, because any impurity in it finds its way into
 the cobalt, and consequently makes that result too high.
    In an experiment with this process, 2500 grm. of cobaltous
 sulphate, and 2500 grm. nickelous sulphate were taken, and the
 quantities found after the separation were 2505 grm. cobaltous
 sulphate, and 2490 grm. nickelous sulphate.                            The estimation of
 the cobalt is rather a troublesome and tedious                       process;    but when
the mixture of nickel and cobalt can be weighed, and the nickel in it
estimated, the cobalt being taken by difference, this is an admirable
method to employ. The following are some results of the estimation
of the nickel in a mixture of 2500 grm. of cobaltous sulphate and
  2500 grm. of nickelous sulphate.

 quantities            of nickelous and cobaltous solutions were then carefully
 measured out, mixed, and the temperature observed.            10 cub.

 vigorously, and the temperature again observed. The precipitate was
 then filtered off as quickly as possible (an aspirator being used to
 facilitate the filtration), and washed, first with cold and then with
hot water.     Three days intermittent washing was required to free the
precipitate   from the undecomposed nickelous and cobaltous salts,
cobaltous hydrate having, as is well known, a powerful attraction for
cobaltous sulphate, thereby forming a basic salt. After washing, the
precipitate was converted into sulphate by treatment with hydric
sulphate, and weighed. The mixed sulphates were then dissolved in
water, and separated by Gibbs’s method, the nickelous sulphate being
weighed, and the cobaltous sulphate obtained by difference. It was
found that a small quantity of sodic sulphate was always present in
the precipitate, the washing having failed to remove           and this                                   it,

  A highly important chemical relation is disclosed when the two
sulphates are so conditioned as to be equally precipitable. We have
seen that this is the case when n=c="84093.       Now the   reciprocal
of 84093 is 1:1892,-a number differing by only the small amount of
0.40 per cent. from 1:1845, or pry.     Deduced, as these values both
are, from a series of experiments, we cannot hold their connexion to
be accidental.   It may be thus expressed in symbols,—
or we may state the relation  thus:- For an equal weight, nickelous and
cobaltous           are equally precipitable; the attraction of the one

towards the reagent being then inverse to that of the other.

to other weights than 84093 grm. of the sulphates, we doubled all the

  If we imagine some reaction—such, for example, as the combina
tion of colouring   matter with a tissue—influenced in one set of
experiments by nickelous sulphate, and in an altogether different set
by an equal weight of cobaltous sulphate, we can hardly conceive any
ground for the development of a reciprocal function, such as we have
experimentally traced. On the other hand, it seems reasonable to
suppose that, when two bodies are simultaneously confronted with
a single reagent, they both contend for its effect.   Thus a chemical
antagonism may arise between them by virtue merely of their being
together; and thence the reciprocal function.  So far as we are aware,
the only other chemical function of the kind, hitherto investigated, is
to be found in Chizynski's" examination of the partial precipitation,
by ammonic phosphate, of mixed calcic and magnesic chlorides.
That chemist arrived at the conclusion, for which we consider his
evidence to be adequate, that “equal masses of calcic and magnesic             .
chlorides have always equal, but oppositely active, coefficients of
affinity.”

       Arc.”   By JAMES     DEWAR,   M.A., F.R.S., Professor of
       Chemistry    to the Royal Institution. Received June 5,
       1879.
   A series of experiments favouring the conclusion that the so-called
carbon lines are invariably associated with the formation of acetylenet.
induced me to make some experiments to ascertain whether this sub
stance can be extracted from the electric arc, which invariably shows
this peculiar spectrum at the positive pole, when it is powerful and
occasionally intermittent.      For this purpose the carbons were used in
the form of    tubes,  so that a current of air could be drawn by means of
an aspirator through either pole, and the products thus extracted from
the arc, collected in water, alkalies, and other absorbents.     Gases may
 be led   through    one of the   poles, and suction induced   through  the
 other, in order to examine their effect on the arc.
   The following experiments record the results obtained by means of
the Siemens and de Mériten's magneto-machines.
   Evperiment 1.—Drew a current of air by an aspirator through the
drilled negative carbon, and passed the gases through potash, and
iodide of potassium, and starch paste; found no nitrites;

hydrocyanic acid, the condensed water in a small bulb gave nitrites.
   Experiment 4.—Air drawn through the negative carbon gave con
siderable quantities of hydrocyanic acid, which was greatly increased
by extracting the gases through the positive carbon. Air was aspirated
at the rate of about one litre per minute.
  Experiment        5.—The    same carbons used          with    de   Mériten's magneto
machine gave no result.                                                                         -
   Experiment 6.—Carbons purified in chlorine and hydrogen gave
with de Mériten's nothing; with Siemens’ and a draught of air
through the negative pole, a small quantity of hydrocyanic acid, but
a larger yield when the positive was used.     The gases extracted after
the  absorption  of the  hydrocyanic   acid contained acetylene. If the
carbons are not  purified, sulphuretted  hydrogen is always found along
with other gases.
   The inference to be drawn from the above experiments is that the
high temperature of the positive pole is required to produce the re
action, which is in all probability the result of acetylene reacting with
free nitrogen, as when induction sparks are passed through the mixed
gases,   viz.—
                                   C2H3+N2=2HCN,
and that the hydrogen is obtained from the decomposition of aqueous
vapour, and the combined hydrogen in the carbons.     is possible that     It
traces of alkaline salts in the carbon poles may favour the formation
of hydrocyanic acid, but, as           all

                              (Preliminary Note.)
   Last year I incidentally mentioned in a note to the Royal Society
(“Proceedings,” vol. xxviii, p. 291), that the production of natural
colours by the agency of light, examples of which were shown by
Becquerel, was probably caused by the oxidation of silver compounds
employed.       I have ventured to return to the subject, in order to show
that the colours are so produced and are not due to interference.
   I   have sent, for the Society's inspection, pictures of the solar
spectrum on silver plates, and also on compounds of silver held in situ
by collodion.      It will be observed that the spectrum has imprinted
itself in   approximately   its natural colours; that on the silver plates it
is more brilliant than on the collodion film, but that in the latter the
colours are seen by transmitted as well as by reflected light.
   I  reserve for the present the exact details of the production of these
pictures, but may say that they are produced by oxidation of silver
compounds when placed in the spectrum; an exposure of two minutes
being amply sufficient with a wide slit to impress the colours. The
colouring matter seems to be due to a mixture of two different sizes of
molecules of the same chemical composition, one of which absorbs at
the blue end and the other at the red end of the spectrum, and the
sizes of these molecules are unalterable whilst exposed to the same
wave-lengths as those by which they were produced.               I  believe it
possible and probable that the colours may be preserved unchanged
when exposed to ordinary daylight.

                                   (Abstract.)
   The object of the present paper is to trace the influence of the
atomic weights on the melting and boiling points and heats of forma
tion of elements, and especially of their compounds. It is shown that,
as regards the elements, the melting points are a periodic function

 1879.]      Dr. Carnelley.      On Melting and Boiling Points.         191
 of their atomic weights, whilst, for compounds, the following          con
 clusions are drawn:—
    I.  That the melting and boiling points and    heats of formation of the
 normal halogen compounds of the elements are a periodic function of
 the atomic weights of the constituent elements.
    II. That the influence of the halogen on these same physical pro
perties increases with the number of its atoms in the compound.
    III.  That in any normal halogen compound the influence of either
of the elements on the melting or boiling point increases with its own
atomic weight, and decreases with the atomic weight of the other
element.
    IV. The melting or boiling point or heat of formation of a bromide is
always nearer to that of the corresponding chloride than to that of the
corresponding iodide; and that the melting or boiling points of the
halogen compounds of the middle member of three consecutive ele
ments of the same group are always nearer to those of the first member
(i.e., the one with least atomic weight) than to those of the last
member.
    The former of    these phenomena probably depends on the fact that
the atomic    weight   of Br is nearer to that of Cl than to that of I, i.e.,
less than the mean of the two: and the latter on the fact that the
atomic weight of the middle member of three consecutive elements of
the same group is always less than the mean of those of the other two
elements.
    V. That the melting and boiling points of the halogen compounds
of the elements belonging to the first and second groups of Mendele
jeff's classification are widely separated from those of the other groups,
being in fact considerably higher.          Different relations too often
appear to exist between the melting points of the even members of
these two groups to those which exist between groups (3–7) inclu
sive; while the compounds of the elements, which are often placed in
the odd divisions of the first and second groups are generally altogether
irregular. In the case of the odd members of the first group this may
be explained by the fact that it is very uncertain whether Cu, Ag, and
Au really belong to the same group as Na or not, as pointed out by
Mendelejeff in his memoir on the “Periodic Law,” in which he places
these elements not in the first group along with Na, but in the eighth
with Fe, Pd, Pt, &c.
   As far    as existing   data allow us to judge, the compounds of the
elements with monatomic organic radicals also obey the same laws as
those of the halogen compounds.
   A   process for calculating unknown melting and boiling points (in
the case of halogen compounds) by a method of limits is next described,
which gives very good results when applied to known melting and
boiling points, the average error for all known boiling points being

 + +4°.5    C, or 0.8 per cent, and for all known melting points +15,
or 3 per cent. The calculated values for a large number of unknown
 melting and boiling points are given.
   It is also shown that a knowledge of the melting or boiling points
of the halogen compounds of an element may serve for the determina
tion of the atomic weight when the application of the methods of
specific heat and vapour density are inadmissible, or the results
obtained by these contradictory.
   An application of this is made in the case of beryllium, concern
ing the atomic weight of which there has recently been some dispute.
From his determination of the specific heat of the metal, Emmerson
Reynolds concludes that it is a dyad with atomic weight 9:2, whereas
Nilson and Petterssen, from their determination of the specific heat,
assign to it the atomic weight 13:8, in which case it would be trivalent.
Now, according to calculation, the melting points of the chloride,
bromide, and iodide of beryllium ought to be (820–870°)*(802-820°)
and (766–777°) respectively.         The boiling points, also, ought to
diminish from the chloride to the iodide, if beryllium is a dyad with
atomic weight 9:2.      If it be a triad with atomic weight 13.8 these
melting points ought to be about 500° lower, and the melting and
boiling points ought to increase from the chloride to the iodide. With
the object of settling this point the melting points of the chloride
and bromide have been carefully determined, and it was found that
the chloride melts at 858–890°, thus agreeing with the limits (820–870°)
calculated for BeCl2 (Be=9:2).         The bromide also fuses between
858 and 890°, and at almost exactly the same temperature as the chlo
ride, but if anything slightly higher, the calculated number for BeBr,
being 802-820°.      The rather high number found for the bromide is
probably due to the substance being so readily volatile below its
melting point that the heat absorbed during conversion into vapour
cools the remainder of the solid, and thus prevents it melting so soon
as it otherwise would    do.   These results confirm the view that beryl
lium is a   dyad, with atomic weight 9:2; for though the melting point
of the bromide is apparently slightly higher than that of the chloride,
for the reason already given, yet BeBr2 is far more volatile than BeCl2.
XIII.   “Separate Enumerations of Primes of the Form 4n+1 and
      of the Form 4n+3.”          By J. W. L. GLAISHER, M.A., F.R.S.,
      Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.            Received June 11,
      1879.
   The present note contains the results of separate enumerations of
primes of the forms 4n+1 and 4n+3 for seven groups each of 100,000
                      * Reckoned from absolute zero -273.

  1879.]             Separate Enumerations     of Primes.                 193
 numbers, viz., the subjoined tables give the number of primes of the
 form 4n+1 and the number of primes of the form 4n+3 in each ten
 thousand of the hundred thousand numbers of the first, second, third,
 fourth, seventh, eighth, and ninth millions. The properties of the
 4n+1 primes and the 4n+3 primes are very different; and the idea
 of separately enumerating     the two forms originated with Professor
 Tchebycheff, and was conveyed to me through M. Edouard Lucas.
    The enumerations were effected as follows:—Each page of Burck
 hardt's and Dase's tables contains eighty lines corresponding to the
 eighty numbers 1, 7, . . . 97, 101, 103, . . . 199, 203, 209, . . . 299, i.e.,
 to the eighty numbers less than 300, and not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.
 The lines corresponding to numbers of the form 4n+1 were ruled
 through in pencil, and then the bars (representing primes) which
 were ruled over were enumerated separately, and also the bars which
 were intact.   The enumerations for the first three millions were made
 from Burckhardt's tables, and those for the seventh, eighth, and ninth
 millions from Dase's tables.     In the case of the fourth million the
 enumerations were made from the proof sheets of my father's factor
 table of this million, the whole of which is now printed, and, with the
 exception of the few last pages, stereotyped.
    The results for the groups in the first three millions were commu
 nicated to the Meeting of the British Association at Dublin, and are
 published on p. 471 of the Report for 1878. It is there stated that
 “the numbers given in the table are the result of a duplicate enume
 ration; but a third enumeration will be required, in order to render it
 certain that they are absolutely free from error.”     This third enume
 ration has now been made and the following two errors in the British
 Association table were detected by means of it: in the first ten thou
sand of the second million the numbers of 4n+1 and 4n+3 primes
should be respectively 390 and 363, instead of 391 and 362 as printed,
and in the third ten thousand of the third million the numbers should
be 350 and 343 instead of 349 and 344 as printed.         In the case of the
other four millions, the results for which are here given for the first
time,  I have thought a careful duplicate calculation sufficient.
    The number of 4n+1 primes in each hundred was found by count
ing, and entered in its place on a printed form; and the number of
4n+3 primes was similarly found and entered on another form.
As a verification, the two results for each hundred were added
together, and entered on a third form. These totals should agree
with the numbers of primes in each hundred, which had been obtained
in the previous enumeration that     I had made of all the primes in the
seven millions; and such was found to be the case.             It is to be
observed, however, that any error arising from the inaccurate or
imperfect ruling of a pencil line would not be detected in this
manner, as such an error would consist in a 4n+1 prime being

194                         Mr.  J.  W. L. Glaisher.                       [June      19,
counted as a 4n+3 prime, or vice versá; but pains were taken to
verify completely that the pencil lines had been ruled correctly, and
for two of the millions (the seventh and ninth) the ruling was per
formed twice independently, in the one case a second copy of Dase
being used, and in the other the original lines having been rubbed
out before the second calculation was commenced.                The enumerations
were however troublesome, and it was much more difficult to ensure
freedom from error than in the case of the simple enumerations of
primes.
    A specimen of a portion of one of the printed forms for the entry of
the number of primes in each hundred, which have been referred to
above, is given on p. 102 of vol. vii of the “Messenger of Mathe
matics” (1877), and a preliminary account of the results of the
complete enumeration of all the primes in the first, second, third,
seventh, eighth, and ninth millions has been printed in the “Pro
ceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,” vol. iii, pp. 17–23,
47–56 (1876–77).f The results of the enumeration for the fourth
million will appear in the volume containing the factor table for that
million.

first one hundred thousand numbers of each million, taken from the
subjoined tables, are

    The most noticeable feature in these numbers is the               excess      of the
4n+1 primes over the 4n+3 primes in the groups taken from the
second, third, and fourth millions; in these three groups there are
10,473 primes of the form 4n+1, and 10,293 of the form 4n+3, the
difference being 180, and the total number of primes 20,766.

   The effects of chloroform and ether on the pulse, when employed to
produce anaesthesia in surgical operations, vary considerably.                        Some
times the heart's     force,    estimated    by  the   lowering    of the primary       rise,
with due attention to the spring pressure, is greatly diminished, some
times it is increased.          The rate of the pulse is generally increased.
The    rhythm     is often    deranged,      sometimes very much, and so-called

 No very marked difference exists between the two agents as re
 their effects, but chloroform seems to have the more depressing

    The opinion is expressed that the curves apparent in many o
 tracings are not by any means solely the result of respiratory 1
 ments, but more often of deranged cardiac or arterial action.      Ex
 mental    tracings are  given, showing  the effects of forced  inspir
 and expiration, and of the former when the subject had been
 viously in a state of semi-suffocation, and the blood, there
 detained in the right cavities of the heart. It is pointed out tha
 occurrence of waves of contraction in the arteries, such as are set
 the bat's wing, would account for the production of some of
 curves, especially those which exhibit the curious phenomeno,
 diastolic ascent. The view is maintained that the occurrence of cu
in the tracing is a morbid sign.
    The tendency of narcosis to produce flattening of the tops of
several beats is pointed out, and it is particularly observed that
same change is marked in cases of fatigue of the heart.        The he
force, and the arterial contractility are no doubt weakened in
states—narcosis and fatigue—and this weakening is regarded
accounting, together with the engorgement of the right auricle
veins, for the flattened summit of the beat.

the port of Aden, and also the reduction of the observations by
method of harmonic analysis, with the view to the prediction of the t

save the large outlay which the numerical operation of their predic

 ponents  sufficient to predict the Indian Ocean tides with all the
 accuracy necessary for practical purposes.
   The present machine is the outcome of the recommendation.
   The instrument combines the following twenty tide-components —
   The mean lunar semidiurnal;
   The first and second overtides of the mean lunar semidiurnal;
   Two elliptic lunar semidiurnal;
   Two evectional lunar semidiurnal;
   One variational lunar semidiurnal;
   The    mean solar diurnal;
   The    mean solar semidiurnal;
   The    lunisolar semidiurnal;
   The    lunisolar diurnal;
   The lunar diurnal;
   The solar diurnal;
   One lunisolar elliptic diurnal;
   One lunar elliptic diurnal;
   One compound (Helmholtz) lunisolar semidiurnal;
   One compound (Helmholtz) lunisolar quarter-diurnal;
   The solar annual; and
   The solar semiannual.
     Strictly speaking, there is no sensible astronomical tide-component of
 twenty-four mean solar hours’ period, but for the purposes of prediction
 it is necessary to include such a term, a very regular and sensible result
 of this period being obtained in the analysis, due probably to wind or
 temperature.      The same remark applies partially to the solar annual
 and the solar semiannual, the theoretical tides of these periods being
 very small; the analysed results, however, are of considerable value,
 being due probably to the effect of rainfall and the regularity of the
 monsoons.      These three components should, therefore, be regarded
 more as    meteorological than astronomical.
    The stipulation that the scale for heights should be one inch per foot
 range for Bombay necessitated a recording barrel of some 18 inches
 at least; the actual length adopted for the instrument, however, is
 22 inches.    The delineation of the curves on such a large scale ren
 dered necessary some modification of the system of eccentric pulleys,
as fitted on the tide-predicter of the British Association.        It was at
first contemplated to        parallel slides only

    The recording barrel is fitted with brass pins at equidistant inter
 vals to form the time indications on the paper by perforation.      An
 index for setting is fitted behind the machine at the top of the re
 cording barrel.
    The paper, which is continuous and supplied from a reel, passes
 round two grooved rollers at the back of the main barrel, and is held
 in position whilst the pins enter the paper, and after receiving the
 curves is wound round the haul-off drum.    The haul-off drum rests on
 toothed driving-wheels, and by friction turns and slips to accom
modate itself at a proper tension to receive the recorded paper.
Motion is given to the whole system of wheelwork through the
horizontal centre main shaft from a system of clockwork driving
gear at the bottom of the machine, the whole being driven by a
weight calculated at about 4 cwt., and controlled by a fan.         A
warning bell sounds when the weight is nearly run down. The length
of the barrel round which the cord is wound is sufficient to give
15,000 turns of the main shaft.   This corresponds to about 3 months'
run of curves, and will occupy about 1 hour to run off. A year's
tide-curves for any port will thus occupy about 4 hours.
   The setting of the machine for the prediction of the tide-curves of
any part for which the tide-components are known, is as follows:–
The dials are first turned so that the epoch or time of maximum is
exactly under or above the highest or lowest point according as the
component is situated on the upper or lower row of components.
The cranks are set vertically (the slotted cone of the wheel on the
axis having been first released) and the guide-pin thrown out to its
proper range to represent the half-amplitude of the component. The
proper positions of the hands having been previously determined by
calculation for the time of starting, the hands are set and the slotted
cones tightened    up.     The recording barrel is then set to the time and
the wheelwork set        in motion. The complete setting occupies only a
few minutes.
  The large dial in the centre is for showing the progress of the
record, which can be marked occasionally to facilitate the entry of the

peared        it might
                 be useful to have a series of results which would serve
in future as a test of any proposed theory of double refraction with
out the necessity of a further recourse to experiment.      It is therefore

optic axis.
   For this purpose                 I
                        used four prisms, the edge of each was very
approximately perpendicular to the optic axis.
   The axis was inclined at angles of -32°, 14°, 38°, and 64° respec
tively, to the normal to one of the faces of the prism, the angles being
considered positive when the optic axis and edge of the prism        the                                          lie   on

   The values of 6 are determined from the known position of the
wave in question, with reference to the normals to the faces of the
prism, and of these normals with reference to the optic axis.
    The results of the comparison are as follows:—
   For the red line C, just in the neighbourhood of the major axis of
the elliptic section, the curve given by experiment lies inside that
given by theory, the two coincide at about 15° from this axis, hence
forth onwards the experimental curve lies outside, and the two coincide
again near the minor axis.
    The greatest difference amounts to rather over 0001, about half way
between the axes. If we decrease slightly the major axis of the ellipse
as given by theory, we may say that the result of experiment is ex
pressed by an oval curve coinciding with Huyghens' ellipse at the
 extremities of its axes, and lying outside of it for the rest of course,                         its

between the axes, and there amounting              about Tolooth part

XVII. “On       the Vapour Densities of Potassium and Sodium.”
        By Professor JAMES DEWAR, M.A., F.R.S., and ALEXANDER
        SCOTT, B.A. Received June 12, 1879.
    The ingenious method of determining the vapour densities of
volatile bodies invented by Professor Meyer" suggested the revision of
work done by one of us in connexion with Professor Dittmar,t on
the vapour density of potassium. The new method possesses several
advantages over that formerly employed, and seemed to be especially
fitted to simplify the difficulties of working with substances having
the chemical characters of the alkali metals. The fact that a constant
temperature need not be maintained unless for a short time, and that
all absolute determinations of temperature are unnecessary during the
course of the experiments, renders Professor Meyer's system the
simplest when the boiling point of the substance is above a white
heat.
   The apparatus used was simply a reproduction in wrought iron of
Professor Meyer's glass one, on a somewhat larger scale.        The bottle
A had a   capacity   of 160–180  cub, centims. The tube B was about
2 feet long and in diameter about 5 inch.      A and a considerable part
of B was coated with a glaze of borax and then fitted between two
crucibles as in figure, and the crucibles filled with fine sand as com
pletely as possible.
   This apparatus kept a tolerably constant temperature for a con
siderable time even when the furnace temperature varied considerably,
as it was only slowly affected, owing to the mass of the crucibles and
sand surrounding       it.The chief difficulty   first was the diffusion

the furnace gases, especially carbonic oxide, through the hot iron.

    After the apparatus had been placed in the furnace and had risen to
 a dull red heat, the tube E was inserted into it and made airtight at
 C by the india-rubber tubing F, the point of the tube reaching almost
 to the bottom of A. Hydrogen was now passed into the apparatus by
 D, and a current kept up until the apparatus was thoroughly reduced;
 by this time the temperature had risen sufficiently for the experiments
to be proceeded with.    The apparatus was now filled with nitrogen,
which was likewise passed in at D, the tube E withdrawn, and an
india-rubber stopper inserted into C, and the end of D immersed in
water or mercury.     The weighed substance was then dropped in at
C, and the gas expelled, collected in a graduated jar in the usual
Inannel".
   The substances whose vapour densities are to be determined, were
placed, after weighing, in small iron capsules and kept in them by a
plug of wire gauze. This was done in order to ensure their reaching
the bottom of the apparatus, and the wire gauze plug also had the
advantage of moderating the rate at which the gas came off. The
potassium and sodium were placed in tared iron capsules and weighed
in dry carbonic acid, and then the plug of wire gauze inserted.
   To test the apparatus cadmium was tried and gave very good

results.    Zinc was next used, but with very slight success, owing, we
believe, to the formation of an alloy of zinc and iron, even although
the temperature was far above the boiling point of zinc. This was
shown by the wire gauze plug and capsule becoming very brittle,
so that the wire gauze might be rubbed to pieces between the fingers.
An approach to approximate results was once got with an apparatus
which had not been reduced by hydrogen, the coating of oxide of iron
and silica having protected the iron from the zinc.       Mercury gave
good results in this apparatus. With potassium and sodium greater
difficulties stood in the way of exact results, as the correct weight of
the pieces inserted could not be ascertained, and both metals seemed
to have a tendency to behave in the same manner as zinc, viz., to form
an alloy with the iron; because the vapour evolved after a few
minutes was absorbed completely in spite of all precautions to pre
vent oxidation.     Both of these sources of error tend to make the
numbers found for potassium and sodium too high. The mean error
due to the weighing of the metals was found by measuring the
hydrogen given off by their action on water, and the action of the
iron was partially overcome by raising the temperature as much as
possible, so as to induce rapid volatilization.
   After each experiment the metallic vapours were blown out by a
strong current of hydrogen, by inserting (as before in reducing the
apparatus) the tube E, and passing the hydrogen in at D, refilling
with nitrogen, and proceeding as before.

  constituent elements, has an especial interest for the chemist. The
  chief physical constants of this substance are unknown, although
 its polymerised modification, benzene, has been very thoroughly studied
 in its physical relations by Regnault. Having one of M. Cailletet's in
 genious pumps for the liquefaction of gases at my disposal in the
 laboratory of the Royal Institution, Professor Dewar suggested a
 series of accurate determinations of its physical properties in the
 liquid state, and the present communication deals with the critical
 point, the tension of the vapour of the fluid at various temperatures,
 together with the corresponding densities and coefficients of com
 pressibility.
    The only notice on the liquefaction of the gas appears to be a short
 paper by M. Cailletet in the “Compt. Rendus,” vol. lxxxv, No. 19, in
 which he determines the tension of the vapour of the liquid at diffe
 rent temperatures. These tensions, as will be afterwards seen, differ
 entirely from those obtained in the present paper, one of the reasons
 appearing to be that instead of using a carefully calibrated air mano
 meter for determining the pressures, he used the ordinary metallic
 gauge attached to the pump, which is far from being correct.
    The pump itself is too well known to need description, suffice it to
 say, that two of the iron bottles or reservoirs were used, connected
 with the pump by a piece of fine-bore copper tubing, so as to equalise
 the pressure, one containing an air manometer registering             the
pressures from ten atmospheres upwards, and the other the tube filled
 with acetylene. The two bottles were then placed side by side, and
the height of the column of mercury in either read off by means of a
cathetometer.
    The formulae used for calibrating the tubes, and also for calculating
the volume of the liquefied gas, and the pressure by the air manometer,
were those given by Dr. Andrews in his researches on carbonic acid
 (“Phil. Trans,”    1869 and 1876). The method of preparing the acety
lene gas was   by the action of alcoholic potash on bibromethylene, the
disengaged gas being collected in the form of the red acetylide of
copper, by passing it into a strong solution of subchloride of copper in
ammonia. This red compound, after being thoroughly washed and
boiled with distilled water, was transferred to a flask with dilute hydro
chloric acid, the gas driven off by means of a gentle heat, and con
ducted through a strong solution of caustic soda, to free it from traces
of hydrochloric acid, and finally through two small U-tubes with
fused chloride of calcium.    The perfectly pure and dry acetylene was
now passed through the tube to be used for its liquefaction in a slow
stream for several hours, and the latter carefully sealed off when all
the air had been expelled.
   The sealing off requires great care, as unless rapidly done, and the
pressure removed from the inside (by cooling the tube) immediately

 the point is closed, the acetylene becomes rapidly charred and blows
 out, a small portion of it being consequently decomposed, and thus
 interfering materially with the accuracy of the results.
    The tube for the tension determinations was of the usual shape
 used in the Cailletet pump, the internal diameter of the capillary part
 being about 2.5 mm. This was found to be more convenient than a
 narrower tube, as a larger reservoir could be used, and consequently a
 larger quantity of liquid obtained.
    The pressure at the different temperatures was always observed
 when a very slight layer of liquid was formed on the surface of the
mercury, as the gas not being entirely free from air, the pressure was
 slightly increased on filling completely the upper part of the tube.

 Cailletet:—

    The temperatures above zero were kept constant to within               :th of a
degree, by allowing a constant stream of water to flow over the tube
from a reservoir holding about 10 gallons, in which it had been pre
viously thoroughly mixed. The temperature of -10° was obtained by
cooling down alcohol with ice and salt, and that at –23° by surround
ing the tube with a narrow glass cylinder containing liquid chloride
of methyl, which boils constantly at this temperature; this cylinder
being again enclosed in a wider one containing a little phosphoric
anhydride to prevent moisture from condensing on the sides.
   It was thought interesting to compare the tensions of liquid
acetylene with those of the saturated vapour of benzene, being
polymeric bodies, although having totally different properties.                For
this purpose curves were plotted for the two substances, that for the
benzene being taken from Regnault's results (“Mem. Acad. Sci.,
Paris,” vol. xxvi, p. 420).             They do not, however, run parallel to
each  other,  the benzene        having   a slower rate of increase at low tem
peratures, but a quicker rate than the acetylene as the temperature

rises. The curves, however, have no appearance of actually crossing
at a higher temperature.
   The critical point of acetylene, or that temperature at which no
appearance of liquefaction takes place, however great a pressure is
exerted on the gas, was found after many careful experiments to be
37°:05 C.
   For determining the density and compressibility of the liquid at
different temperatures, a tube of much smaller dimensions was used,
having a capillary bore of about 8 mm. in diameter, the whole of the
tube having a capacity of 36,3708 cub. centims. This gave a column
of liquid about 15 centims, long when the upper part of the tube was
entirely full at 15°C.
   The density at any particular temperature was taken by forcing the
liquid up the capillary tube at that temperature, until the upper part
was completely filled; the length of the column of liquid was then read
off, its volume calculated, and this observed volume divided into the
calculated weight of the gas at zero.                         They are             as   follows:—

  It is evident from the above tables that acetylene is governed by
the same laws as other compressible liquids, that is to say, its com
pressibility increases as the temperature rises, but diminishes as the
pressure increases.   For instance, at a pressure of 95 atmospheres it is
three times as  compressible at 35°C. as at 0°C.
   The volume being the same, the compressibility appears to be nearly
the same at different temperatures, which is really due to the curves at
high pressures running nearly parallel, thus introducing a correspond
ing difficulty in the estimation of small differences.
   On comparing the compressibility of liquid acetylene with the
results obtained by M. Amagat (“Annales de Chem.,” 1877) in the
case of benzene, it appears to be about seven times as compressible as
the latter body, at a temperature of 16°C., and under a pressure of
40 atmospheres. The comparison could not be carried out at higher
temperatures, for whereas M. Amagat reaches a temperature of 100°C.

   The authors, beginning with (A) “The different kinds of rocks
treated of,” in their memoir, divide them into two groups. The first,
“Silacid Ophites,” is represented by serpentinite (common at the
Lizard) and other rocks, essentially composed of serpentinous minerals:
it includes a subsection, comprising peridolites and some others, all
slightly hydrated. The second, “Silocarbacid Ophites,” consists of
rocks, which, in addition to serpentinous minerals, contain a mineral
carbonate—for example, ophi-calcite: its subsection is represented by
hemithrenes.    The relation of the first group, through its subsection,
to ordinary metamorphic rocks, also of the second group, through                          its
subsection,            to

it is altogether untenable, both from his own arguments, and a body of
unquestionable counter-evidence.    Repudiating a doctrine which regards
the rocks in   question as still being in their original or quasi-original
condition, formed at the bottom of a primaeval ocean, through the
chemical precipitation of substances which it held in solution, the
authors express themselves in accordance with the prevailing opinion
that they were originally ordinary argillaceous, arenaceous, and other
sediments, which, through being buried at great depths, have under
gone various changes—some ending in their mineralisation and others
in their methylosis.    Sterry Hunt's doctrine is further contested by
 evidences adduced of regional metamorphism pertaining to various
post-Archaean periods, whose crystalline or mineral effects are identical
with those which he restricts to pre-Cambrian ages, and which he pre
sumes to have been produced by chemical precipitations from seas

“The origin of the minerals characteristic of ophites, &c., especially

considered to be of secondary origin, the exceptions being those
remaining unaffected by secondary agencies.      Serpentines, malacolite,
phlogopite, chlorite, enstatite, and a number of others are all considered
as secondary minerals.     Peridote, notwithstanding that it is generally
considered to be an original mineral in the same sense as the hornblende,
feldspar, mica, &c., of granite and other plutonic rocks, is regarded by
the authors as a product of alteration in all its relations, and circum
stances of occurrence. Its presence in granites, basalts, and lavas has
given rise to the belief that it is of igneous origin: nevertheless its
occurrence in mineralised and methylosed rocks (gneiss, and ophite of
the sedimentary section) is held as proving the contrary: and the
authors feel themselves justified in assuming that it is as much a
secondary product as the zeolites and pseudomorphs found in granites,
basalts, and lavas.   Many of the crystals occurring in basalts and
lavas, which have been taken for peridote, are in their opinion pseudo
morphs after augite and hornblende.

been effected by additional    water penetrating them, and flowing from
extraneous or   foreign  sources.  Compared with each other, mineralised
rocks may be classed as xerothermal, and methylosed as hydrothermal.
     Various evidences are adduced to show that (L) “Some ophites
have been originally igneous, and others sedimentary rocks,”—a con
clusion favouring their secondary, and consequently their methylotic
origin.
     (M.) “Some crystalline limestones are simply mineralised,” such as
carrarite; though rocks closely related to them,-viz., “Dolomites, have
undergone methylosis.” With regard to the latter, however, the authors
do not accept Von Buch's theory of dolomitisation in its general appli
cation. Admitting various kinds of this phenomenon, they conceive the
change in certain well-known cases has been effected by the action of the
 magnesian constituents of sea water on subjacent beds of limestone;
for example, during the closing portion of the Triassic period, as
 strongly supported by geological evidences, determined by Ramsay
 and others, the seas in certain European regions became dried up or
 reduced; and their water, loaded with magnesian salts, sank through
 the subjacent sandstones and marls into the Permian limestones, thus
 converting them into dolomites. Irish corroborative cases are men
 tioned. The dolomites of the Tyrol are held to have originated in
 the same way; but it is admitted to be probable that the predazzite
 of the Canzacola mountain, Val di Fassa, was dolomite that became
 hydrated by the heated water which accompanied the eruption of the
 immediately adjacent and overlying monzonite. “Serpentinisation
 effected in deposits without the intervention       of mineralisation” is
 admitted in the production of the magneso-argillite at Vallecas near
 Madrid, also of that in the Paris Basin, and other localities; for Sullivan
 and O'Reilly have shown that it was originally a non-magnesian deposit.
      The authors conclude by treating of (N) “The Chrono-geological
 range of Ophites, &c., and the age of their methylosis.”           Offering
  merely possible suggestions as to the age in which this phenomenon
  took place in what may be regarded as the oldest ophites (as the
  subject is beset with considerable difficulties), instances referable
  to secondary periods, as the dolomites and serpentine rocks of the
  Tyrol, &c., are briefly noticed; but they refer more confidently to the
  methylosed euphotides, &c., of Northern and Central Italy, which,
  having burst through Cretaceous limestone (alberese), Eocene sand
  stones and schists, have incontestably produced gabbro verde during late
  Tertiary ages.     Moreover, it would appear, from the discoveries of
   Achiardi, that argillaceous schists, in Tuscany, are now being serpen
   tinised by the action of magnesiated water. And, taking the wide
  range of evidences, which have been adduced, into consideration, it
   can scarcely be doubted that the same process is still in operation in
   deep-seated rocks, permeated by heated waters.

      Oxon. Communicated by Professor HUXLEY, Sec. R.S.
      Received     June   16, 1879.
   In  a previous communication*      we stated that a decinormal solution
of oxalic acid may      be entirely  destroyed by sunlight, the decompo
sition being due to oxidation. By a comparison, under like conditions,
of oxalic acid and neutral potassium oxalate respectively we further
concluded, since the last-named salt appeared to remain unchanged
while the former was wholly decomposed, that this destruction of
oxalic acid by light was due to the oxidation of its hydrogen.
   During the present year, however, we have made a closer and fuller
investigation, which shows that the immunity of neutral potassium
oxalate is not absolute, and that we must further extend our views as
regards the power of light to promote the oxidation of certain of the
elements.
   A measured quantity of normal solution of oxalic acid was carefully
neutralised with—
                      1. Potassium hydrate.
                      2. Sodium          25
                      3. Ammonium        ,
                      4. Lithium carbonate.
The solution was then diluted up to ten times the volume of the
normal oxalic acid originally taken, so that in each case the resultant
neutral solutions contained the same weight of the oxalic radical, that,
namely, which would be found in an equal bulk of decinormal oxalic
acid.    Selecting sixteen test-tubes of similar size and bore, we divided
them into four sets of two pairs each.            In each set respectively we
placed one of the above-named solutions (each tube receiving 50 grain
measures carefully measured by means of a pipette), a corresponding
batch being charged in precisely the same way with a freshly prepared
decinormal solution of oxalic acid. All were next raised to boiling
point, to prevent development of organisms, and plugged with cotton
wool. They were then placed on an outside window-sill, one pair of
each batch being incased in laminated lead, the other left freely ex
posed to the sun's rays. This was on March 28. On each of the
dates given in the subjoined table an insolated and an incased tube of
each set were compared by titration in the following manner.                 By
appropriate    dilution and measurement exactly a fifth part         of the con

 1879.]      On Long-continued Stress on Elasticity of Metals.                   221
 well-known decomposition of potassium iodide in sunlight has led us
 to believe that in this case (KI) the phenomenon is of similar cha
 racter.    The nature of this decomposition of potassium iodide has
 been much discussed, and observers, misled as it seems to us by a
 supposed analogy with ordinary photographic reactions, have sin
 gularly failed to recognise the possibility of the oxidation of metallic
 elements by light. Hence they have ascribed this behaviour of potas
 sium iodide to acids, carbonic and other, of the atmosphere. On this
 point, however, we have satisfied ourselves; first, that in a Sprengel
 vacuum a 10 per cent. solution remains perfectly colourless in sun
 light; and, secondly, that decomposition invariably occurs in an in
 solated solution when no other gases than nitrogen and oxygen are
 present."     Here the oxidation can only be that of the alkali metal,
and analogy would suggest, a similar inference in the case of the
oxalates. We are, however, still engaged on the investigation, and
our present object is rather to qualify the statement in our previous
paper as to the supposed indestructibility of an alkali-oxalate by sun
light, than to advance to a conclusion for which the          -    evidence is not
yet sufficient.

    The following paper is intended to describe the results of experi
ments on elasticity of wires which have been carried on during the
past two years, in the Natural Philosophy Laboratory in the Uni
versity of Glasgow.                            -
    In 1875, at the Glasgow meeting of the British Association, a
Committee was appointed, at the suggestion of Sir William Thomson,
for the purpose of commencing secular experiments on the elasticity
of wires, and a grant of money was placed at the disposal of the
Committee.                     -
    These    experiments     have accordingly been commenced.              An iron
tube about 70 feet long has been erected in the tower of the Uni
versity.     Two wires of gold, two of platinum, and two of palladium,
   * The mode in which we insured, as we believe, the absolute freedom of the air
employed from acid impurity was the following:—Exhausting           tubes to a good
Sprengel vacuum, we admitted—by means of the apparatus we described in “Proc.
Roy. Soc.,” vol. xxviii, p. 210–air which had been standing, with frequent
agitation, for six days over a solution of potassium hydrate. To make doubly sure,
the exhaustion was again repeated and the purified air a second time admitted.
The tubes thus treated acquired a brown tinge in light as quickly as did similar ones
simply plugged with cotton wool.

have been hung up, one of each pair with a light stretching weight,
and the other with a weight equal to half its breaking weight. Marks
have been put upon the wires; and a cathometer has been erected
opposite to a window in the tube for the purpose of observing the
difference of elongations in each pair of wires.
   In connexion with the commencement of these experiments we
gave as an experimental exercise to some of the students in the
Natural Philosophy Laboratory, the comparison of the stretching and
breaking of wires at different speeds.      Interesting results followed,
and the investigation was then taken up systematically, and is still
being carried on.                                        -
   Pure soft iron wires were obtained, and were hung up with an
arrangement for measuring the amount of elongation. They were
then loaded more or less quickly till they broke, and the elongation
with different loads was determined. A large number of curves, of
which a specimen is given below, have been traced showing the
elongation produced by different loads under given circumstances.
They will be considered in detail in a future communication.
    The following is a general account of the experiments that have
been made.
    Lengths from the same hank of the wire, which was specially drawn
for the purpose, were hung     up and a scale pan having been attached
to the lower    end,  weight was put on till the scale pan and added
weight together made up 28lbs.       This was the greatest weight that
could be put upon the wire in its natural condition, without causing
permanent    elongation.   The wire was generally left with this load
applied to it for 24 hours.       Sometimes the wire ran down very
slightly in the 24 hours with the load, but not often.           -
    Some of the wires were then broken quickly. One pound was added
to the scale pan, say every three or every five minutes, except in cases
where the wire was visibly running down, when no fresh weight was
added till the running down stopped.          Another set of wires was
broken by adding a pound every 24 hours; another set was broken
by adding three-fourths of a pound every 24 hours; another set
by adding half a pound every 24 hours; and an experiment was
commenced in which a quarter of a pound was to be added each day,
 but this was discontinued, and to this wire there was added one
sixteenth of a pound, not at regular intervals, but only after the wire
 had borne the weight on it for upwards of 24 hours without suffering
any perceptible elongation. When a small weight is added to a wire
as was done in this case, the elongation takes place very slowly.     The
 wire goes on running down slowly, often for several days, and it was
 in order to cause the whole effect of the previous weight to have been
 produced before any fresh weight was added that this mode of adding
 weight was adopted. The experiment unfortunately was brought to

an end after about five months had been expended on it by the wire
becoming rusted through.    A fresh wire was, however, suspended
some months ago, and was carefully varnished to prevent rusting. It
is now under experiment.

        The following tables contain                  a considerable part        of the results of
 these experiments.
   Two kinds of wire were used both of pure soft iron wire, drawn
for the purpose of these experiments, but differing slightly in the
treatment during the annealing process. They are distinguished in
our note books as “Black annealed wire ” and “Bright annealed
wire.” Tables I and                   III
                        show the results of quick breaking of these
two  wires, and Tables                 II
                        and IV the results of slow breaking. It will
be seen that the slow and long-continued                of stress has in
                                                               application
variably strengthened the wire, a result in itself of great importance.
It should tend to correct some of the views commonly held as to the
danger of applying severe loads, as tests to iron structures, such as
steam boilers.              It
                   appears that the iron wire here employed was in
more than one case actually improved in strength by about 10 per
cent. As the wires tested were about 16 feet long and very uniform,
it is very unlikely that the wires 8, 9, 14,                      in Table II, were ab
                                                                 15,
normally strong over such a                      length; while the wire 12, in Table II,
the only one which is not strengthened, may readily have contained
some slight flaw, or may have been broken by some jar in putting
on the weights.
   The result as to amount of elongation is no less important.           Wires
broken  rapidly    receive an  elongation     of over 25   per  cent. on the
average; while the same wire broken slowly is only elongated by
about 7 per cent., and in the case of the bright annealed wires so
small elongation as 4.79 per cent. was found with a breaking weight
increased by 5% per cent.
   A specimen curve showing the relation between stretching weight
and elongation is here given. It will be seen that the stretching does
not go on uniformly.        At the beginning the wire resists stretching
 very much, till the weight of 32 lbs. is reached.                 however,           If,              a

the  carrying   out of these experiments by Mr. Sinclair Couper, who has
not only most faithfully carried out the work entrusted to his charge,

various points of the inquiry.
XXII.     “Note on the paper (read April 24)* “A Summary of an
      Inquiry into the Function of Respiration at Various Alti
      tudes on the Island and Peak of Teneriffe.”                      By WILLIAM
      MARCET, M.D., F.R.S.               Received June 16, 1879.
   In the above-stated communication, after alluding to Dr. Rattray's
observationst and remarking that             I  had formerly held the same views
as he   did,   namely,      that less carbonic acid was exhaled under in
creasing temperatures of the sun;                I add,   I am now compelled, how
ever, to alter this view, and to conclude that more carbonic acid is
formed in the body under a tropical or nearly tropical sun than under
temperate latitudes.
         I
   Lest should be considered as ascribing to the sun’s heat a power
which so far has not been acknowledged by physiologists, namely,
that of increasing the formation of carbonic acid or the combustion
                I
in the body, must beg to explain in a few words how the question
now stands.        I shall end by asking leave to suspend any opinion as
to the cause of the increase of combustion in the body observed to     I

has been brought to bear on the subject.
   From trustworthy experiments by known authors, heat and light
are found to act differently with respect to the formation of carboni.
acid in the animal and human body; increased heat, as a rule
diminishes the production of this gas, and it is generated in exces:
under increased light.

   The experiments of Edward Smith,” show that more carbonic acid
is expired by man in summer than in winter. Vierordtt finds that a
change of temperature, equal to 10° F., alters the amount of
                                                             carbonic
acid expired by 0.0183 per cent, increasing it to that amount by a
fall, and raising it by that figure through an increase.       These
 observations were made                    under temperatures ranging                    between 38°.7
 and 75°.7 F.
                 1845, investigated the action of low and high tempera
        Letelliert in
 tures on the production  of carbonic acid in the animal body. Animals
were made to breathe under a glass receiver during periods varying
from half an hour to several hours. The results are stated in tables
which show generally that at the temperature of 32° F., the carbon
burnt is twice as great as at 86°F., while at the ordinary temperature
intermediate figures are obtained, there being at times an increase
and at others a falling off in the amount of carbonic acid formed.
This applied equally to a canary bird, a dove, two mice, and a guinea
pig; there was, however, a peculiarity with respect to two of the guinea
pigs.   Out of three experimented upon, No. 1 yielded at high and
low   temperatures  1.457 CO2 and 3:006 CO2 respectively, or nearly
in the proportion of 1 to 2, while with guinea-pigs Nos. 2 and 3 the
proportion of carbonic acid expired was 1 to 1:5 or 14, instead of 1
to 2. In these cases, however, both animals had been clearly very
uncomfortable under the high temperature, and one died. The sur
vivor's temperature had risen by 3° and that of the other by 5° 5. But
the circumstance perhaps most worthy of notice, as Letellier expresses
it,   that heat which the author finds under ordinary circumstances
        is

carbonic acid, and in darkness 522, giving the proportion of 1 to
1:25, the increase of temperature accompanying the light's influence
only amounted to 2° 93 C., so that it could not be considered as
having exerted any influence. In another paper (same vol. “Compt.
Rend.”) Moleschott determines the degree of the light used in his
experiments by means of photographic paper exposed for five minutes
to the light, and compares the depth of tint obtained with standard
colours.   He finds that the carbonic acid produced under a feeble
degree of light is to that exhaled under a very powerful light as
1 : 1:18, the increase of temperature being only by 1”65 C.                  He
concludes:—1. That frogs for similar weights, and in equal periods, ex
hale from one-twelfth to one-quarter more carbonic acid when breathing
under the influence of light than while in the dark, so long as the
temperatures are equal or vary but slightly. 2. The production of
carbonic acid increases in a direct ratio with an increase of the light
to which the animals are submitted. 3. The influence light exercises
towards increasing the amount of carbonic acid emitted, acts partly
through the eyes, partly through the skin.                    -
   Our   knowledge     on the influence of       light   upon   the growth of
animals, has been extended quite lately by the interesting experiments
of Emile Young, of Geneva.” The favourable influence of violet and
blue light on the nutrition         of animal tissues is clearly demon
strated in that paper.      He cites M. Béclard who, in 1858, observed
that the worms from flies' eggs acquired growth in violet and blue
light much more rapidly than in white and green light. Mr. Emile
Young, by experimenting on frogs' eggs, observes that tadpoles
become developed much more speedily in violet and blue light than in
red and green light, and, moreover, that when grown in white light,
and then exposed without receiving any food to the influence of
coloured lights, they die soonest under the violet rays.          He also states
he has seen that tadpoles reared under violet light resist starvation
longest if placed afterwards under white light.             He concludes that
violet light apparently promoted the nutrition of tadpoles more than
any other coloured light. An allusion is made in his paper to the ex
periments of General Pleasanton, who found, by keeping young sows
 under violet and white glass during six months, that those under the
violet glass gained, for equal weights, 34 lbs. more than those under
white glass. Experiments on oxen by the same author yielded similar
results.
   From this mass of experimental work bearing on the influence of
heat and light on animal combustion, it may be concluded:–1. That
an increase of temperature causes, or strongly predisposes to a

Animaux.”    “Archives des Sciences Physiques et Naturelles,” Mars, 1879.

falling off in the production of carbonic acid, or lessens combustion in
the animal body. 2. That increase of light, especially of violet and
blue light (the most actinic rays), either causes, or greatly predis
poses to the formation of an increase of carbonic acid, thereby pro
moting animal combustion.
   These results do not, it will be observed, apply to the united action
of heat and light, but to the influence of heat and light considered
                                   I
separately. They are, fear, calculated to give us but little assistance
towards a knowledge of the influence of tropical climates on the
phenomena of combustion in progress in the healthy human body.
   The only direct experiments and observations on that subject, with
which    I
         am acquainted, are those of Dr. Rattray, alluded to in my
paper.   He finds that the body loses weight in passing from a cold
into a tropical climate, and regains it on its returning under a colder
latitude; and, moreover, that in tropical countries the temperature of
the body has a distinct tendency to rise slightly above      normal con                  its
dition     temperate zones.

   Such, far beyond what could have been anticipated, has been the
case      the experiments described. So complicated, indeed, have

much more than reach the threshold of a very comprehensive inquiry.
Still, we hope to establish some points of general interest; and possibly
to indicate promising paths of future research.
   From the title of our paper, it will at once be concluded that the
experiments were originally undertaken and arranged from an agri
cultural point of view.      But, as experimenting on the feeding of
animals soon led us into lines of inquiry of even more interest to the
chemist, the animal physiologist, and the dietetician, than to the
agriculturist, so the investigation of the effects of different manures
on the mixed herbage of grassland has led us far beyond the limits of
a purely agricultural problem, and has afforded results of more interest
to the botanist, the vegetable physiologist, and the chemist, than to
the farmer.    Indeed, agriculture, the most primitive, and commonly
esteemed the rudest of the arts, requires for the elucidation of the
principles   involved in its various practices, a very wide range of
scientific inquiry; and the investigation of them may, in its turn, con
tribute facts of interest to the student of various and very distinct
branches of natural knowledge.
   It will be readily understood that, as a necessary foundation for the
discussion of the botany and the chemistry of the subject, it will be
essential first to put on record, and call attention to, what may be
distinguished as the agricultural data. It is proposed, then, to arrange
and consider the results obtained under the following heads:—

briefly indicated      asfollows:—

left without manure from the commencement; two have received
ordinary farm-yard manure, whilst the remainder have each received
a   different description          of

 amounts of    phosphoric  acid also vary  very strikingly; and so again it
 is with other mineral   constituents,  but in a less marked degree.
    It will be seen that in the history of so many of what may be called
 natural rotations, we can hardy fail to learn much that is of interest,
 not only in reference to the growth of the mixed herbage of perma
 nent grass land, but also something of the relative positions of the
 different plants that are grown separately, in alternation with one
 another, in the artificial rotations adopted on arable land.
    The botanical results are, moreover, of much independent interest,
 both by the facts which they already contribute, and by the incentive
 and direction they may give to future research.
    Lastly, the chemistry of the subject will be found to offer many
 points of interest, in regard to the variation in the percentage com
 position of the produce, according to the manure applied; to the
 description of plants developed, and to the character of their develop
 ment; to the availableness of the constituents artificially supplied;
and to the amount and limit of the natural resources of the soil, both
 actually and compared with the results obtained when individual
 species are grown in arable culture.
    It will be readily understood that the record, and the discussion, of
the agricultural, the botanical, and the chemical history of about 20
plots, in 20 different seasons, must involve much detail; and although
it is obvious that facts special to any one of the three main divisions
of the subject may require for their elucidation reference to those of
one or both of the others, it is still believed that it will conduce to
clearness,   and reduce unavoidable repetition, to maintain the divisions
proposed as far as possible.

 Results,” is presented. In Part II, “The Botanical Results,” which

   The object held in view throughout this investigation has been that
of instituting an inquiry into the minute structure of the cortex of
the brain in a prominent member of the Artiodactyla,                and to
critically compare the results with those obtained from an examination

of corresponding   structures in certain members of the Ruminantia,
Carnivora, Quadrumana, and also in the human brain.        For this pur
pose the cerebrum was examined in the pig, sheep, cat, ocelot, and
Barbary ape.    In all cases the hemispheres were sliced from end to
end in the fresh state upon the freezing microtone, and the sections
examined seriatin, both fresh and after preparation by a process
already described.*     The regions to which special observation has
been directed, are those over which a five- and a six-laminated type of
cortex prevails, and which, in the members of the Ungulata examined,
include the upper arc of the great limbic lobe (gyrus fornicatus), the
frontal lobe, and the great mass of convolutions entering into the
formation of the parietal lobe.
  In  this brief abstract   Ipropose merely to enumerate the general
conclusions arrived at, and which may be stated as follows:—
  1st. In the Ungulata, as in higher Mammals, the cortex of the
brain exhibits an extensive six-laminated region and a less extensive
area constituted   of five layers of nerve cells. These layers in the
six-laminated cortex consist, as in higher animals, of a peripheral
cortical layer, a second layer of small pyramidal cells, a third layer of
large pyramidal cells, a fourth of small pyramidal and angular
elements, succeeded by the large cells of the ganglionic series, and lastly
the layer of spindle cells. The divergencies observed in various groups
of animals are not dependent upon the general conformation and
constitution of these layers, so much as upon differences observed in
the essential characters of their elements and their mode of dis
tribution.
  2nd. In the five-laminated type, the second band of small angular
and pyramidal cells is absent and the ganglionic layer assumes
characteristic features.
   3rd. Transition realms occur betwixt both laminated types in which
the special features characteristic of the ganglionic series are in direct
proportion to the thinning out and disappearance of the second band
of angular elements.
   4th. The ganglionic series in these members of the Ungulata differs
from that of higher Mammals in the conformation of its individual
elements and their distribution.
  As to Conformation. The cells are more elongated, pyramidal in con
tour, and never    assume the same average dimensions as those of
the cat, ocelot, and ape. The swollen plump cell of these animals is
never seen in the pig and sheep.
  As to Distribution. They are scattered over a comparatively far
wider area of the cortex.
   5th. The pyramidal form assumed by these cells         is, from reasons
stated    the original paper, significant
         in                                 offar less complex relation

ships through their branches, the latter being far more numerous in
the swollen irregular cells of higher Mammals.
   6th. The pyramidal cells of this layer closely approach in their
 dimensions and contour the larger pyramidal cells of the third layer
in man and the ape, and may be assumed to work upon the same
physiological level.
   7th. The ganglionic series in these members of the Ungulata,
assumes the clustered arrangement which is seen most highly de
veloped in the motor area of the brain of the higher Mammalia.
These clusters, or nests of Betz, are in the pig and sheep more densely
packed with cells than in higher animals, cover oblong or oval areas
of some depth, and in the most highly developed region of this
lamination are so closely approximated that they tend to become con
fluent and assume most distinctive features.
  8th.  The regions over which the five-laminated cortex, with its
                        for the Ungulata the anterior half of the great
nested cells, spreads, are
limbic lobe  (superior arc), the whole of the frontal lobe, and the
lower parietal gyri.
   9th. The chief point of interest as regards the five-laminated cortex,
is the fact that the whole ganglionic series throughout this extensive
area maintains a remarkable uniformity of the magnitude of its ele
ments, and in the complexity of their relationships.
   10th. This fact is highly significant, since, upon localising the
corresponding stratum in the cat and the ocelot, we find its grand
development limited to the immediate neighbourhood of the crucial
sulcus.   On the other hand, in the ape and in man we find over
a wide area of the cortex the same type of formation, but, far from
there being general uniformity in the size and complexity of its cells,
there is exhibited here an exceedingly rich development of this layer
in the paracentral lobule of Betz, and the centre for the movements
                                                           :
of the hand and arm, whilst other portions of the motor area are less
conspicuously developed the more distant they are from these areas.
   11th. These anatomical facts enable us to conclude
  (a.) That in the Carnivora the motor centres are concentrated, so to
speak, upon the limited area occupied by the limbic and parietal
boundaries of the crucial sulcus.
   (b.) That in the Quadrumana and Man they are more widely
scattered and betray great divergence in developmental complexity at
different sites.
   (c.) That in the Ungulata they are still more widely scattered, but
exhibit at all points a most noteworthy uniformity in their structural
details and groupings, assuming, at the same time, a great resem
blance to the elements of the third layer of the cortex in the higher
orders of Mammalia.
   12th. It is,therefore, inferred, that dissociation of
                                                      centres plays an

  1879.]         Comparative Structure         of  the Cortex Cerebri.              237
  important part in the explication of fundamental divergencies in the
  rôle of cerebral activity—thus, close               concentrated association of
  centres is maintained in those animals where the associated move
  ments of vast musculatures are required to act in concert for sudden
  and supreme efforts       in the struggle for existence—hence the peculiar
  structure of the motor area in the cat and ocelot.
     The dissociation observed in man and the ape appears to point to
  the comparative       independence of special musculatures, to the possi
  bility of their higher education, and (in the great disproportionate
  complexity of certain areas) to the pre-eminently high and complex
  relationships of these special centres and the musculatures which they
  represent.
     The widespread dissociation of centres observed in the species of
  Ungulata examined, points, on the other hand, to a comparative sim
 plicity in their resultant activities—there being in these animals no
  special demand for the collective and complex associations in action of
  widely separated musculatures.
     13th. The results of the investigation lend still stronger confirma
 tion to the belief that these anatomical units of the ganglionic layer
 are especially concerned in the production of those complex move
 ments, which Ferrier has shown to be the special functional endow
 ment of the motor area; and it is highly probable that a study of the
 dimensions, distribution, and relationships of these cells in the lower
 animals will serve to elucidate, in some degree, the diversified phe
 nomena resulting from the excitation of this important area of the
 cerebral cortex.
    NoTE.—In a recent contribution (“Psychiatrisches Centralblatt,”              Nr. 6),
 Meynert, referring to the discovery by Betz of the pyramidal cells in the motor area,
 attributes to it no importance.    He states that the size of these cells depends simply
 upon the distance pursued by their processes towards the outer zone of the cortex.
 I need scarcely point out the self-evident fallacies involved in this line of argument.
 Suffice it to say, that such a rule cannot be one of universal applicability, since,
although the size of these cells as a general fact increases with their depth, yet,
from the second down to the fourth layer, we find numerous pyramidal cells no
larger than those of the second layer.      Again, over many regions of the cortex, the
cells of the third   layer are often larger  than those of the fourth. In these cases,
therefore, Meynert's assumption is untenable.       Further, these cells are often larger
at the sides of a gyrus and the bottom of a sulcus than beneath the summit of the
convolution, i.e., at a shallower portion of the cortex than at a deeper site. As this
theory of Meynert does not explain the very specialized form, relationships, or
arrangement of these elements, nor provide for the constant and extensive excep
tions to be taken to his rule, the above considerations, together with others which
must occur to a candid and careful inquirer, will prove wholly subversive of such a
doctrine.

   In   the “Proceedings of the Royal Society” for 1866, Dr. Mont
gomery has recorded some very remarkable observations made by him
on the behaviour of “myelin” when brought into contact with water.
“Myelin” being a term of various applications, it is necessary to state
that the substance indicated in Dr. Montgomery's statement is an
alcoholic extract of yolk of egg. A small quantity being placed on
a microscope-slide, and covered with thin glass, is brought under
observation by a tolerably high object-glass.      The mass is shapeless,
and   indistinguishable from crushed   grease till the addition of water,
when a multitude of minute rounded processes begin to sprout from
all parts of the surface exposed to the action of the water. The pro
cesses are, when fairly formed, tube-like, with bulbous or simply
rounded ends, have a thick, refractile contour, and apparently fluid
contents. They remind one of nerve-tubes, or, still more closely, of
the tubular and rounded projections which are seen, under the micro
scope,    to issue from the cut ends of nerves in contact with water.
Dr. Montgomery shows in the same paper that, if albuminous fluid be
used instead of water, spheroidal protrusions are formed, and float free.
   Recently, in the examination of a biliary calculus containing much
cholesterin, my attention has been drawn to some very remarkable
changes of form undergone by that substance under certain condi
tions—changes so important in their resemblance to phenomena
                                                     I
taking place in minute living organisms, that am induced to give
an account of them. It will be seen that they belong partly to the
class of changes described by Dr. Montgomery, as above quoted, and
partly to those described by Mr. Rainey in his well-known work on
“Molecular Coalescence.”                              -
   Pure cholesterin crystallises, as everybody knows, in the form of
colourless rhombic plates. It is insoluble in water and most saline
solutions, but is supposed to be held in solution in the bile by tauro
 cholic acid or the soda salt of that acid. In biliary calculi it is found
for the most part crystalline; but at the surface of calculi and in
biliary gravel it often occurs in lustrous spherules.
   Experiment 1.—An ethereal solution of cholesterin is added to fresh
 egg-albumen in the proportion of one part to two. After good shaking
 in a test-tube, the mixture becomes gelatinous, and is left for twenty
 four hours in the test-tube, or for any period exceeding half an hour,
 in an evaporating dish to allow of free    escape   of the ether.  As the

ether passes off, the cholesterin is deposited in the substance and on
the surface of the albumen. The superficial deposit is partly crys
talline, but the deposit in the albumen is entirely spherical or acicular.
The crystals on the surface are rarely perfect, and generally have rounded                                  up
angles (Plate 1, figs. 1, 2). The spheres are of           sizes        #5 inch           all              to
diameter, and are        first homogeneous and singularly lustrous (fig. 17).

    Experiment 6.—If glycerin be mixed in about equal quantities with
 the acetic acid and cholesterin while still on the slide, and if heat be
 applied, after the covering glass is in place, till bubbles form rapidly,
 the slide instantly examined is found covered with spheres, some as
 large as fat cells and quite regular, others egg-shaped, and others
 aggregated into masses (fig. 12). The masses are dense and very
 brilliant. As cooling proceeds all the spheres break up. The large
 oues contract at their surface, and seem thereby to squeeze out fluid
 from the interior, which takes at first the form of tubes, afterwards of
 spheres.     An active movement of this kind often results in the forma
 tion of a group of small spherules in the place of the large one, looking
 like a glomerulus of spores (figs. 13, 14). Presently these in turn change
 each instantaneously into needles, the change proceeding as follows:–
 a single spherule darts away from the mass; as it goes it leaves a stiff
 raphis in its course, and it is itself proportionately diminished in size,
 till its last fragment forms the point of the raphis (figs, 15, 16). The
 ball      is,   sospeak, unwound into stiff thread

   This series of observations has, in the first place, some importance
 as involving a rapid mode of exhibiting the influence of colloids upon
 crystalline form.  In Mr. Rainey's original processes, and in the later
 experiments made by Harting, of Utrecht, and by myself, the forma
tion of spherules of crystalline matter within colloids has been effected
only on a microscopic scale, and in the most gradual way.            And
although Professor Guthrie has recently, in independent and original
experiments, obtained large spherical masses of sulphate of copper by
the slow evaporation of solutions of that substance mixed with gelatin,
it has not been possible to watch so continuously the steps of the pro
cess.     But      here,    within a short  we are able to see the crys
                                                 compass,
talloid cholesterin assume,  when first deposited within the substance of
the colloid, perfectly spherical form; we can follow the gradual eman
cipation of the crystalloid from the control of the colloid and its
return to a quasi-crystalline form within the albumen, and to definite
crystals within the gelatin or glycerin with acetic acid. We may infer
that the crystalloid is not so intensely crystalloid in its tendencies
when first deposited as afterwards. We may infer also that the power
of the colloid        is,
                  under certain circumstances, when coagulation         not                            is
produced, intensified by heat; and,       the loss     controlling power

have balanced each other for       time, but when the balance has been
                                            a

242                Dr. W. Ord.      Experiments on the         [June   19,
may be compared to the whipping of an egg.          In another, it may be
compared with the cleavage of the ovum after impregnation.          In the
ovum up to the time of impregnation the contents of the zona pellu
cida form one sphere. After impregnation, after the introduction of
a material having the power of inducing new activities, shrinkage is
followed by movements having the character of a gradual peristalsis,
and subsequent fissions reduce the sphere to the mulberry mass of
small equal spherules.
   Regarded from another point of view, we see a series of movements
resulting from the tendency of matter to come to rest. We see
stages which may be compared to the spring of the bow when the
drawn string is let go; and, again, to the straightening of the un
strung bow. Or we may see in the chain of movements, beginning
with the formation of the sphere and ending in the crystal at rest,
a parallel   to the chain of force formed when water is raised by
the sun to the clouds and hill-tops to descend in rain or rivers to the
sea—to rest; or to the chemical chain in which oxygen and carbon,
torn asunder by light within vegetables, slowly recompose carbonic
acid within animals, and in turn come to rest.
   Here, again, the question is suggested to me, how far may
the simpler movements of the constituents of animal and vegetable
organisms be due (among other things) to the struggle of one group
of substances against the grasp of another, to the tendency of each
substance to ultimate complete separation from the substances with
which it is intermixed, and to the tendency of each separated sub
stance to assume the nearest possible approach to a static condition ?
   The observations have, however, an immediate practical relation
to the structure of such biliary calculi as are composed chiefly of
cholesterin.   Such calculi are seen in sections to be composed of
several distinct stratifications.    Most commonly they have (1) a
thin rugged outer layer, deeply tinged with bile colour; within
this (2) a brown portion marked with concentric lines correspond
ing to laminae; within this (3) a lighter-coloured layer, presenting
radiating markings or distinct radiating fissures between crystalline
columns; and, lastly (4), at the centre a mass of deep colour and
friable consistence (fig. 37).      The strata are not sharply defined
from each other, but are     joined  by transitional layers. They differ
severally in minute structure.        In the outer crust (1) distinct
independent spherules and spheroidal masses composed of cholesterin,
mixed with mucus and bile-pigment, can be seen (figs. 27–31).           In
the concentric layers (2) the microscope shows a substance pretty
uniformly inter-penetrated by, and partially coloured with, pigment;
it is marked with radiating crystalline fibrations of varying degrees of
fineness running sinuously at right angles to the concentric markings;
in fact, it shows a combination of concentric and radiating arrange

crystalline columns of cholesterin radiating as from the centre of the
calculus, with accumulations of pigment in the spaces between them;

246       Influence    of Colloids upon Crystalline Form,          &c.    [June     19,
    Experiment 10.—If a little albumin be added to the solution of urea
and if then to the filtered liquid the equal bulk of nitric acid be
added as rapidly as possible, the albumin is only partially precipitated,
and, after a little warming, is all re-dissolved.            In the resulting clear
straw-coloured       liquid  there   appear   during   cooling    spherical bodies,
suddenly suspended at various depths. They look very much like
little globules of solidified fat, and grow rapidly from the size of a
mustard-seed to the bulk of a pea. Each is composed of crystalline
fibres radiating from the centre, and whereas the deposit in the pre
vious experiment does not occupy more than one-third of the fluid,
these fill the whole bulk of the fluid and, mutually compressing each
other, give the contents of the tube in which the experiment is made
the appearance of a bar of beautiful fibrous spar. The experiment
occurred to me first in the examination of concentrated albuminous
urine, but it succeeds equally well with pure solutions, and forms,                    I
submit, the most brilliant illustration of Mr. Rainey's valuable work
hitherto made known.

1879.]                Mr.    J.   N. Lockyer.               On Basic Lines.             247
XXVI. “Report    to the Committee on Solar Physics on the Basic
      Lines common to Spots and Prominences.” By       NORMAN                 J.
      LOCKYER, F.R.S. Communicated at the request of the
      Committee.              Received June 19, 1879.
  I have now for some time past been making efforts to bring together
the various observations which have been recorded of the lines visible
in solar disturbances at the sun’s limb, and those observed to be
widened, brightened or otherwise modified in the spectra of solar
spots.
  The result which            stares us       in   the face when we examine the lists       of
the lines given by Young as representing his Sherman work is so
striking, both with regard to the conclusions which we are justified in
drawing from the old work, and the suggestions for future opera
tions, that    I
              have thought it desirable to call attention to it without
waiting until the Italian observations have been discussed.
   Although Young's observations of the chromospheric lines extend
over the whole visible spectrum, the list of lines in the solar spots is
limited to the region between B and b,                         I
                                            have therefore limited the
discussion to this region.
  As     a basis for the discussion,               I have used
                                           the lines given in Thalén's
admirable      tables, comparing
                               these lists with the lines shown in
Angström's and Thalén's map, and indicating the intensities of the
lines which are given in the tables, and which particular line occurs
in the map only.                                                -
   Further,as a discussion of the coincident lines shown in some sheets
                                          I
of Angström's map, which communicated to the Royal Society last
March, had convinced me that the lines shown to be common to two or
more substances by Thalén were not due to impurities (“Proceedings
of the Royal Society,” No. 194, 1879),                             I
                                                 have shown these co
incidences, where they occur, in a special column.
   Having then Thalén's list for a basis, other columns showing us
whether each line is seen in spots and prominences, and how it is
affected, give us in one view, for each metallic substance, exactly what
happens to the lines of that substance.    We see at once, for instance,
which lines are not    touched, those  again which are visibly affected
both in spots and storms, or those recorded in one table and not in the
                      -
other.                                                         -
   Taking       all       the lines
                          included      the discussion, the
                                                       in                          following

   It will   be seen that the ratio                between      the affected and unaffec
lines is very variable.
   What strikes one indeed in regard to all these substances is the w
derful irregularity in the behaviour of the various lines; there is
relation for instance between the widening of the lines in the sp
and their appearances in the prominences. As                             I    have before sho
there is no      relationship          between the intensities of the lines and tl
appearances         in the spots and storms.
   Amongst          the substances shown in the table                  I   have included sti
tium, in order that the difference in its behaviour in comparison v

   But all these, however, are matters for subsequent discussi
what does come out in the strongest way is the following very
markable fact.
   Among the 345 lines given by Thalén are 18 with identical re
ings in two spectra.              I  have before given reasons to show that th
are not due to mutual               impurities,      they therefore are the exact equ
lents of those lines which                I have termed basic in my communicatio
last December to the Royal Society.

   If they                                    a considerable development
                      be basic, then we should expect
 of these lines in the spectrum of the sun's reversing layer, which spots
 and storms enable us to study apart from the absorption going on at
 higher levels.
    These tables enable us to settle this question, and they settle it in
 the most conclusive way. The only constant thing about the tables
 is, that these basic lines are always widened      the spots. However                                                                    in

XXVII. “On       a  New Method of Studying Metallic Vapours.”
    By   J. NORMAN LOCKYER, F.R.S.        Received June 19, 1879.
               I
   On May 29 read a note before the Royal Society, stating that I
had lately been engaged in studying the spectrum of sodium under
                                    I
new experimental conditions, and pointed out that the vapour given
off from the metal after slow distillation in a vacuum for some time
shows the red and green lines without any trace whatever of the
yellow one.
   No detailed account of the method employed in the experiments
was given, as the most convenient form of apparatus had not then been
determined.
   The novelty of the method consists in the use of the luminous
electric current as an explorer and not as agent for the supply of the
vapours under examination; that is to say, the vapours are first pro
duced by an external source of heat, and are then rendered luminous
by the passage of the current. The length and bore of the tube there
fore control the phenomena to a certain extent.

268                          Mr.   J.   N. Lockyer.                 [June 19,
described is that which     I have found    to answer best, so far as the trials
have yet gone.
   D is the spectroscope.
   E is the lens used for focussing the image of the Geissler tube           on
the slit.
  F is the spirit lamp for heating the retort.
   H     is the battery.
   K and      L are the wires connected with the coil.
   In the second photograph the method of observing the spectrum of
the  vapours close to the surface of the metal is indicated; the same
lètters apply, D’ being however in this case a direct-vision spectro
scope, which was sometimes employed for convenience.
   For determining the exact positions of the lines in the spectrum
 of the vapour in any part of the retort, the larger spectroscope, with
its illuminated scale, was used in the place of the direct-vision spec
troscope.
   The secondary wires of the coil were connected, one with the pole
in the upper bulb at B, and the other with the platinum at A.
   B is an ordinary Geissler tube with two bulbs separated by a capil
lary tube. The great advantage of this arrangement is that this
capillary portion can be used for ascertaining what gases or vapours
are carried over by the pump without any interference with the retort,
both wires being connected with the Geissler tube. If, for example,
the sodium contains an impurity of hydrocarbon, the moment at which
it begins or ceases to come off can be found by examining the spectrum
of this capillary tube.
   After a vacuum has been obtained the retort is heated gradually.
The pump almost immediately stops clicking, and in a short time be
comes nearly full of hydrogen.       The spectrum of the capillary then
shows the   hydrogen    lines intensely bright. After some time the gas
comes off far less freely, and an approach to a vacuum is again ob
tained. Another phenomenon now begins to show itself: on passing
the current a yellow glow is seen, which gradually fills the whole
space between the pole in the retort and the metal; its spectrum con
sists of hydrogen and the yellow line of sodium, the red and green Na
line being both absent until the experiment has gone on for some time.
   As the distillation goes on, the yellow glow increases in brilliancy,
and extends to a greater distance above the pole, and the red and

  The upper boundary of the yellow is quite sharp, the lines and

the yellow one, and connected with it by a sap-green vapour.                   The
spectra then visible in the tube at the same time are—
      Leaf-green.... Green and red lines of Na and C of hydrogen;
                                 D absent.
      Sap-green.      . . . . Green, red, and yellow Na lines of equal    bril

      Yellow    . . . . . . . D alone and C.
      Bluish-green...         C and  F and hydrogen structure.
   To observe the green Na line alone it is          necessary to point the direct
vision spectroscope           just  above   the surface of the metal where the
green is strongest.             It is also necessary to guard against internal
reflections from the glass, as this may sometimes cause the D line to
be seen by reflection from the surface.
   The metallic sodium is apt to condense on the surface of the glass
and around the platinum pole. If this should happen the retort must
be heated until the sodium has again volatilised.               The yellow line is
always seen when the coating extends to the pole.

make the method better understood :—

glass; D now on point of disappearing; green line far brighter.
   The tube then cracked and put an end to the experiment.
   This experiment, although not successful in so far as the isolation
of the green Na line is concerned, is brought forward, as it shows the
details of the observations as dictated by me to my assistant while the
experiment was going on. The experiment has since been successfully
repeated several times, simply with the object of getting the green line
alone. This is best achieved by heating the metal before all the
hydrogen has been extracted by the pump.”
   The method has been tried also with potassium, calcium, and some
other metals, and with metallic salts.                      I
                                             do not, however, yet bring
forward the results have        I
                            obtained, as the experiments are beset with
difficulties; and I am now carrying out a research with the hope of
eliminating all sources of error.
     Imay state, however, that with potassium and calcium       get the               I
same inversion of phenomena, the yellow-green lines of potassium
being seen without the red; while in the case of calcium the blue line
alone was seen.                 -
   The fact that in these experiments we get, as before mentioned,
vapours which at one and the same time exhibit different colours and
different spectra at different levels in the tube, at once suggests the
phenomena of fractional distillation, and supports the following state
ment which             I
               made last March:—
   “Doublets and triplets, as a rule, reverse themselves more freely
than the irregular lines in the same spectrum; which particular
doublet or triplet will reverse depending upon the temperature, as if
the cooler vapour to which the reversal is due varied, as in the case of
fractional distillation.”

others or alone, then we shall get an excess in the reversal of the lines
special to that particular kind of vapour given off.
   It is remarkable from this point of view that have only succeeded            I
in constantly reversing a triplet in the case of manganese, and that                                               I
have only succeeded in reversing a triplet of iron on one or two occa
sions only.   Comparing these results with those obtained in the case
of Na, K, Ca, &c., we have                       here an indication of a considerable phy
sical difference between                       the metals of the alkalies, for instance, and
those of the iron group.
   It is also suggested as a result of the application of this new method
of experimentation, that in the case of a considerable number of
chemical substances not only the line spectrum is compound in its
origin, as       I
              suggested many years ago, but that a large number of the
lines is due to molecular groupings of considerable complexity, which
can be kept out of the reaction by careful low temperature distillation.
   Whether these higher molecular groupings are merely larger phy
sical aggregates or whether they be compounds in a stricter sense,
hydrides for instance, it may take some time to determine; but it is
obvious that however this may be, the finer vapours may exist uncon
taminated with the grosser ones in the incandescent atmosphere of a
                 I
star; and know of no reason why the molecules of such fine vapours
should not combine with each other, and          for the sake          if,

results.    Ihave since learnt, however, that if the liquid to be examined
be  dropped   in slowly throughout, by which a longer time is occupied
in the   performance   of the operation, the result becomes to a certain
extent modified. It appears as though the test under the influence of
 prolonged ebullition fails to possess the requisite stability.       In the
case of  Fehling's  solution used in an ordinary  way     have  long known               I
that when in a diluted state, ebullition alone leads to the occurrence
of change, unless an additional amount of alkali be introduced.          A
certain strength of alkalinity is required to give the requisite stability
to resist the effect of ebullition. With the ammoniated liquid, it is
to be remembered,    a state of considerable dilution exists, viz., to the
extent of 120 in 1,000.
  The introduction of a larger amount of fixed alkali into the
ammoniated liquid suffices to give it the power to resist the influence
of the variation in the method of procedure referred to in conducting
the analysis, and it is to make known the fact of the alteration being
required, that this communication is presented.
  If  Fehling's solution be used in the preparation of the ammoniated
                I
liquid, as originally suggested, the amount of soda employed should
be doubled to meet the requirements.
   It was on account of Fehling's solution being so well known a
liquid, that        I recommended the ammoniated test to be made from                                             it.

 PART    III.—Tube-Potential ;     Potential at a Constant Distance and
      Various   Pressures;  Nature and Phenomena of the Electric Arc.
   In  the first part of this paper the authors describe a series of experi
ments to determine the potential necessary to produce a discharge in a
tube, exhausted gradually more and more while using a constant
number of cells in all the experiments. In consequence of the life of
the battery becoming so much exhausted by the method employed, the
experiments were confined to one gaseous medium, namely, hydrogen.
Since the completion, however, of the measurements described in the
paper, the authors have found two other more convenient methods for
determining the tube-potential, which do not exhaust the battery
injuriously; these are described in an appendix. The tube, 162, em
ployed was 33 inches long and 2 inches in diameter, the distance
between the ring and straight wire terminals being 29.75 inches; the
battery consisted of 11,000 cells.     The discharge took place when the
pressure was reduced to 35.5 m.m., 46,710 M, and the exhaustion was
afterwards continued gradually until it fell to 0:0065 m.m., 8:6 M.
In commencing each set of experiments the deflection of a tangent
galvanometer was observed when the battery was short-circuited.         By

a table previously    calculated, the value of the deflection in ohms of
resistance per cell could be read off; this multiplied by 11,000 gave
the total resistance of the battery; the tube was then connected with
the terminals and the galvanometer again observed; this gave a less
deflection and indicated a greater resistance, which, multiplied by
11,000, gave the total resistance of the tube and battery: by sub
tracting the resistance of the battery the resistance of the tube was
ascertained.    Calling the total resistance R, the tube resistance r, the
tube-potential   V,
                    v-2'"             The tube-potential requisite to pro
duce a discharge, with a pressure of 46,710 M, was found to be
10,250 cells; this gradually fell until a pressure of 0.642 m.m.,
1,082 M, was reached, the tube-potential being then only 430 cells,
after which it rapidly rose and, at 8:6 M, it required a potential
of 8,937 cells to produce a discharge. From the experiments de
scribed in Part    II (p. 103, foot note), it was found that, in another
tube, it required the full potential of 11,000 cells to produce a dis
charge at 3 M, and that, at 1:8 M, this potential was insufficient.
The obstruction to the discharge in tube 162 was as great at 8.6 M, as
at 28,553 M pressure, and required 8,950 cells in each case. A few of
the more remarkable phases of stratification in tube 162 are shown in
one of the plates which illustrate the paper.
   The next part of the paper deals with the potential necessary to
produce a discharge between disks 1-5 inch in diameter, at a constant
distance and at various pressures.
   In the first instance, an experiment was made in order to ascertain
whether there was either any condensation or dilatation of the gas
in contiguity with the terminals before the actual passage of the dis
charge. In order to do this an apparatus was constructed, as shown
in fig. 1.
   It consists of a glass cylinder, the depth of which is accurately the
same in every part, so as to ensure the parallelism of two glass disks
which close its ends.
   These are held in contact with the ends of the cylinder by means of
screw-clamps made of ebonite, and the whole apparatus is supported
on a tripod ebonite stand, which is fastened to a square wooden foot.
Attached parallel to the top and bottom glass disks, by means of
flanged-screw rods, are two brass disks with rounded edges, 4 inches
in diameter; these are maintained at a distance of 0:13 inch, 3.3 m.m.,
at which the discharge of 11,000 cells would only just take place.
   The ends which project through the glass disks are furnished with
binding-screws for attaching wires from the battery.
   On the side of the cylinder is a tubulure in which is fitted a gauge
containing strong sulphuric acid, so as to dry the inside of the ap
paratus, and to indicate whether any condensation or dilatation of the

gas  contained in the cylinder occurs on connecting the metallic
disks with the battery by means of the contact-key.   The edges of the
cylinder were rubbed with grease, and care was taken to prove that
the apparatus was perfectly tight, by causing the fluid in the limb of
the gauge to stand for some time higher than that in the bulb. When
contact was made with a battery of 9,800 cells, there was not the

slightest indication of any alteration of volume of the contained air,
so that there was neither condensation about the disks which would
have caused a contraction, nor             repulsion from the disks which would
have caused an expansion of                 volume. The fluid in the stem was
observed with a lens, but not              the slightest motion of it took place.
The same result was noticed                even when water was substituted for
sulphuric acid.        So far, then, as this apparatus would indicate               it,   the
result   is   entirely negative.

disks to the striking distance at atmospheric pressure for the battery of
11,000 cells. Afterwards a less number of cells was connected with the
disks and the bell-jar gradually exhausted until the discharge occurred;
the height of the gauge was then read off. Then a less and less
number of cells was connected with the disks and the operation was
repeated.   There was a gauge about 36 inches long attached to the
pump-plate in order to indicate the pressure beyond the range of the
gauges attached to the pumps.
   In air the discharge took place at ordinary atmospheric pressure
with 11,000 cells when the disks were 0:13 inch, 3.3 m.m. distant; and
with 600 cells at an average pressure of 10 m.m.
   In hydrogen it took place at atmospheric pressure with 11,000 cells
when the disks were 0.22 inch, 5.59 m.m. distant; and with 600 cells.
at an average of 14 m.m. pressure.
   In carbonic acid, at atmospheric pressure with 11,000 cells, when
the disks were 0.122 inch, 3.096 m.m. distant; and with 600 cells at
an average pressure of 5.2 m.m.
  The numbers obtained for air, hydrogen, and carbonic acid respec
tively were plotted down on millimetre scale paper, the abscissae being
1 m.m. =2,500 M, the ordinates 1 m.m.–25 cells, and curves drawn
to give a mean of the several observations. These appeared to re
semble hyperbolic curves so closely that true hyperbolic curves were
found partly by a geometric construction, partly by computation,
which would intersect the mean experimental curves in two points.
The results of experiment were again laid down on these new curves,
and it was found that they did not differ more from them than they
did from each other.

   The experiments were made in a bell-jar, containing the terminals,
which could be gradually exhausted after having been filled with air
or other gas. One of the terminals was fixed to the bottom plate, the
other could be adjusted to any distance from it by a rod sliding
through a stuffing-box in the glass cover. The foot of the stand was
insulated by a disk of ebonite, on which it stands. One such bell-jar
is 9% inches (23.4 centims.) high and 5% inches (14.9 centims.) in
diameter; its cubical content, obtained by covering the open ends with
glass plates and filling with water from a graduated measure, was
found to be 3,787 cub. centims.
   A remarkable phenomenon was observed on making connexion
between the terminals and the battery by means of the discharging
key (already described in Part I, page 4), namely, that within certain
limits of pressure in the bell-jar a sudden expansion of the gas took
place, and that as soon as the connexion was broken the gas then
as suddenly returned nearly, but not quite, to         original volume        its                                  in

of cooling.      It is
                     evident, therefore, that the increase of pressure
cannot be ascribed to the instantaneous heating of the bell-jar 82° C.
   Taking the dimensions of the arc from a photograph, it was calcu
lated that it must have attained the enormous temperature of 16,114°C.,
if the increase of pressure was really due to heat. It was found that
platinum wires 0.001 inch in diameter supported in various parts of
the arc were immediately fused; the temperature of the arc was there
fore as high as the fusion-point of platinum, and possibly considerably
higher.                                                            -
  If the whole of the heat evolved by a current of 0.01102 W, through
a resistance of 600,000 ohms had been communicated to the air in the
jar, weighing 0.339 grm. it would raise it 215°6 C. in one second.
It is known from direct experiment that this enormous evolution of
heat was not communicated to any extent to the air in the bell-jar,
because its temperature only increased about 0°-64 C. per second;
the heat must consequently have escaped almost instantaneously by
radiation.    It is difficult consequently to realise the conjecture that
the enormous dilatation which occurred instantaneously could have
been caused by increase of temperature.       And it points to          its
                                                                      being

 diagram, fig. 2, which only indicates the central bright portion of the
 arc, this never quite reached the negative terminal, near which there
 was always the well-known dark discharge.
     As the pressure was diminished the arc widened out until at last the
 entire surface of the negative disk was covered with a luminous halo,
 and the discharge took up a stratified appearance.
     The appearances presented by the arc in air, hydrogen, and carbonic
 acid are copiously illustrated by copies, in mezzotint, of photographs
 and drawings as in Part    II in the case of stratified discharges in tubes.
 During the course of these observations the increased pressure caused
 by the current was recorded, and an arrangement was made to ascer
 tain whether the increase of pressure was greater near one or the
 other terminal.    For this purpose a divided bell-jar was constructed,
 both ends of the two halves being accurately ground, and a glass disk
 divided the chamber into two parts; in this there is a hole half an inch
 in diameter made with a raised rim, in order that plates of mica with
 holes of different diameters might be cemented with Canada balsam
 centrally to the diaphragm.       The capacity of the upper half was
 found to be 1,530 cub. centims., that of the lower half 1,755, total
 3,285.
     That portion of the chamber which was in communication with the
 gauge was connected alternately with the positive or negative terminal
 of the battery, and the depression noted. When this chamber was
 either -- or + the ratio of increase to the normal pressure was—
                               -              +

    It would appear therefore that the dilatation of the gas is the same
both in the positive and negative chambers.
    In order to prosecute their experiments in a vessel of still greater
capacity, the authors had constructed a larger jar with a neck at each
end, or more properly speaking perhaps, a tube supported horizontally
on ebonite crutches. It is 37 inches long and 5}# inches in diameter,
its cubical content was found to be 14,435 cub. centims, or 3.8 times
that of the bell-jar employed in the experiments on the electric arc.
    The experiments with this tube will necessarily occupy a con
siderable period, partly on account of the long time it takes to exhaust

it after each     set,  partly on account   of the variety of experiments it is
intended to make with           it; consequently they describe only a few of
the first results hitherto obtained.

    Pressure 3 m.m., 3,947 M, 6,300 cells.              Two luminosities were
formed, the ring negative being surrounded with a nebulosity which
completely filled the end of the tube. The tube glowed brilliantly
 with a blue fluorescent light, which proved to have great actinic
power. A dry-plate photograph obtained in 5 seconds records a very
 curious phenomenon, namely, that the outer boundary of the
 luminosity appears darker than the tube. It is to be remarked that
while the discharge was reddish (nitrogen), the fluorescence of the
 tube was blue; the effect appears to be due to the absorption of a
 portion of the fluorescent light emanating from the back of the tube
 in passing through the red luminosity.              The effect was quite un
 expected, and it was thought at first that it might have arisen from
 some peculiarity         in the development of the dry plate; it was not
 therefore until the result had been confirmed by other photographs that
 they ventured on the explanation above given.
    The paper closes with the following conclusions:—
    1. For     all gases there is a minimum pressure which offers the least
 resistance to the passage of an electric discharge.      After the minimum has
 been   reached, the resistance to a discharge rapidly increases as the
pressure     of  the medium      decreases.  With hydrogen the minimum is
 0.64 m.m., 842        M ; at 0.002 m.m., 3 M, it is as great as at 35 m.m.,
                                                   -
 46,000 M.
    2. There is neither condensation nor dilatation of a gaseous medium in
 contiguity with charged terminals.
    3. When the discharge takes place there is a sudden dilatation of the
 medium      in addition to and distinct from that caused          by heat.   This
 dilatation   ceases   instantaneously  when the discharge ceases.
    4. The potential necessary to produce a discharge between parallel flat
 surfaces at a constant distance and various pressures, or at a constant
 pressure and various distances, may be represented by hyperbolic curves.
  The resistance of the discharge between parallel flat surfaces being as the
  number of molecules intervening between them.
    5. This law does not hold with regard to points.           In Part   I  it has
 been shown that the potential necessary to produce a discharge at the
 atmospheric pressure and various distances is as the square root of the
 distances, while with a constant potential and various distances, the
pressure has to be diminished in a greater ratio than that of the increase
 of distance in order to permit a discharge to take place,
    6. The electric       arc and the stratified discharge  in vacuum tubes are
  modifications    of the same phenomenon.

    For the most part        these latter substances are known to contain the
aromatic nucleus as an essential part of their constitution.                    Thus the
oils of bay, pimento, and cloves, contain the substance eugenol, or
C.H.OH.OCH3C5H5; oil of cassia consists of cinnamic aldehyde,
C.H.C2H2COH; oil of aniseed of anethol, C.H.OCH3C5H5; and
oil of thyme contains thymol, C6H3.OH.CH3C5H7, as well as much
cymene, C6H1 CH3.C3H7.
    Some other oils, such as bergamot and oil of peppermint, as likewise
the bodies menthol, carvol, and myristicol, have an unknown con
stitution. The three latter substances are known to be isomeric
(“Journal of the Chemical Society,” vol. xxv, p. 1).
    Great interest is attached to our examination of these bodies, since
we consider it to be proved from the character of the spectra they
transmit that the nucleus of menthol is a terpene, while the benzene
ring is the inner basis of carvol and myristicol.                Bergamot appears to
be a    terpene    mixed with some derivative of the aromatic series, but the
oil of peppermint on the other hand is essentially a substance belonging
to this latter class. The refraction equivalents of carvol and myris
ticol are abnormal, like those of benzene derivatives, a fact which
confirms our conclusions           regarding      the constitution       of  these  sub
stances.
   The following is       a summary       of our observations with regard to the
terpenes:
   1.   The terpenes with the composition                CloB16   possess,   in  a  high

  degree, the power of absorbing the ultra-violet rays of the spectrum,
  though they are inferior in this respect to benzene and its derivatives,
  to which class of bodies they are so closely allied.
     2. Terpenes with the composition C15H21 have a greatly increased
  absorptive power for the more refrangible rays, that is to say, they
  withstand dilution to a greater extent the greater the number of carbon
  atoms in the molecule.
     3. Neither the terpenes themselves nor the oxidised or hydrated
  derivatives occasion absorption bands under any circumstances when
  pure, but always transmit continuous spectra.
     4. Isomeric terpenes transmit spectra which generally differ from
  one another in length, or show variations on dilution.
•    5. The process of diluting with alcohol enables the presence of
  bodies of the aromatic series to be detected in essential oils, and even
  in some   cases the amount of these substances present may be estimated.
     Several diagrams in illustration of the kind of absorption exerted
  by the different substances are presented with the complete paper.
  III.  “Preliminary Note on Magnetic Circuits in Dynamo- and
        Magneto-Electric Machines.” By Lord ELPHINSTONE and
        CHARLES W. VINCENT, F.R.S.E., F.C.S., F.I.C. Received
        July   26, 1879.
     The experiments which form the subject of the present note were
  made in connexion with an investigation as to the best form for the
  construction of a dynamo-electric machine, intended to furnish cur
  rents of high intensity in great quantity.        The principle deduced
  applies equally to magneto-electric machines.
     The source of power in all dynamo-electric machines being electro
  magnets whose cores are already slightly magnetic, it appeared to us
  necessary to consider the conditions under which the initial force of
  such machines is best obtained.
     For this purpose we   made use   of a U  electro-magnet having a core
  of soft iron 2 inches in diameter and 36 inches long. The arms of the
   U were 4 inches apart. The exciting helices were two sheet copper
  reels, 12 inches long, fitting closely upon the uprights of the U, but
  readily removable.     Each of these reels was coiled with 200 yards of
  No. 14 double covered copper wire.
     Two cores of soft iron, of the same diameter, and each 12} inches
  long, and which could be magnetised by the same helices, were also
  employed.
     The principal armature was of soft iron, 8 inches in length, by
  2 inches in width, and 1 inch thickness, rounded at the ends. Its face

fitted approximately close to the poles of the U magnet, whose faces it
completely covered when placed upon them.
    Other armatures and magnets were employed, the form of which
 we propose to describe in a future paper.
    The iron of which the U and the straight cores were made was
found to be exceedingly plastic as regards molecular magnetic polarity.
In a few seconds after the cessation of an electric current from twenty
quart Bunsen cells acting through the above helices, they were        in
 capable of attracting and holding even fine iron filings.
    The U magnet tested with a suspended magnetic needle was found
to retain some magnetic polarity after many days; in fact, it is
 doubtful if the magnetism ever entirely disappeared, except when the
 core was subjected to special treatment.
    On the other hand, the straight cores lost their induced magnetism
 more rapidly, and when, having been demagnetized either by time or
 by the mode described further on, they were placed in the line of the
magnetic dip, they showed poles in accordance therewith; and on re
versing the position of the core, these poles were immediately reversed
without its being necessary to resort to striking the bars or other
 means of putting them in a state of vibration.      It was thus demon
strated to our minds that if iron of similar quality, and in this form,
were made use of for the electro-magnet cores in a dynamo-electric
machine, the initial force producing the electric currents of the machine
 could not be due to residual magnetism, but rather to the lines of
 magnetic force of the earth.
    The current from four Bunsen cells sent round the U magnet fixed
the armature so firmly that it could not be pulled, or even slid off, by
the utmost exertion of one man’s strength.
    On breaking battery contact, if both poles were completely covered,
 a direct pull failed to separate armature and magnet.     The armature
 could, however, though with difficulty, be slid off; the difficulty of
 movement greatly increasing as the edge of the poles was approached.
 For instance, on attempting to slide the armature off the north, the
 south, or both poles, the resistance became greater as the point of final
 communication between the poles through the moving armature was
approached.  This was found to be the case whatever time had passed
between the rupture of contact and the first movement of the arma
ture. (Sometimes many days elapsed.) In very many experiments it
was found, moreover, that, provided neither pole had been completely
uncovered, on sliding back the armature to       its
                                                 normal position, the
magnet, which with its stand and coils weighed over      58
                                                      lbs., could       be
lifted by it.

rested on one pole only, it was of course strongly held; but on break
ing contact it was at once set free, and fell off if not balanced; the
magnetism of the U core immediately falling to its minimum, as shown
by suspended test needles.     If, however, the most minute point of
connexion existed between the armature and the other pole, in addi
tion to its complete contact with the one it covered, it continued to
be firmly held long after battery contact was broken.
    It being thought that possibly the effects described were partly due
to molecular attraction of the iron atoms when brought into close
contact under magnetic stress, the poles were coated with a layer of
tallow, but if this was sufficiently thin, the magnet could still be
lifted by the armature after breaking battery contact. When the
tallow was broken into small lumps, allowing light to be seen be
tween magnet and armature, the same result was obtained.
    Thus absolute metallic contact was found to be unnecessary for the
retention of a considerable amount of magnetism by the U core and its
armature, when in magnetic circuit.      With a piece of writing paper
interposed between the poles and armature, they were held together
with great force long after battery contact was broken; but when the
distance was increased by the interposition of cards, nails, or wires,
to "g of an inch, the residual attractive force was very much lessened.
When the magnetic circuit becomes more open the residual magnetism
dies away in about the same proportion as the attractive force of core
and armature, whilst under the influence of the battery current
it becomes less when the distance between them is increased.
  Interposition of thick glazed note paper caused such         a diminution
of the residual magnetism that the magnet could          no longer be lifted
by the armature.
   The experiment was varied by putting lengths of fine silk thread
straight across between the armature and the magnet; in this, as in
the former experiments, the armature was firmly held, and the magnet
could be lifted by it.  There was    nopoint   ofactual metallic contact,
and  light could be seen over both   magnetic  fields, except     the thin
                                                                  at
lines where the silk threads were.    The 58 lb. magnet, when lifted by
the armature, was thus literally suspended     in the air (like Mahomet's
coffin) by the magnetism remaining        the almost closed circuit, and
                                          in
this long after the exciting electric current had ceased. (The experi

together, and then the armature was forced off, the needle would
swing 20° and fall back to 5° very slowly (in about fifteen minutes).
   If both poles of the U magnet were caused to be of the same name,
and the armature placed upon them, there was no attraction after
breaking battery contact.
   The straight cores, if placed upon the U magnet connected by the
armature, and then magnetised in such a way that the poles of the cores
faced like poles of the U magnet, retained no magnetic polarity when
taken away from the system, whereas when they formed part of such
a closed circuit as we have above described, the bars retained sufficient
polarity to affect a magnetic needle for some time.
  We may here remark that the attractive force of electro-magnets
for each other, in what we call open circuit, is not nearly as great as
in a closed circuit.  For instance, the U magnet could not be lifted
by the straight cores placed upon    itspoles, even with  a  current from

spective of the position of the exciting helices, whether both were on
the magnet, both on the cores, or one on the magnet and one on a core.
   From the foregoing experiments it appears clear that the more near
the approach to a closed magnetic circuit, the stronger is the field of
force, and the longer is retained the magnetism of the mass or masses
of iron constituting the circuit. The same rule holds good with
regard to permanent magnets. In closed circuits the attractive force
is at its height, and diminishes in intensity as the magnetic field is
more extended. But the parallel goes beyond this, for the more open
the magnetic field, the more rapidly is the magnetic force itself dis
sipated.
   These principles have guided us in the construction of a dynamo
electric machine of whose magnetic circuits we here present a sketch,
and which we hope to describe more fully in a future paper.
   In the accompanying diagram six fixed electro-magnets are shown,
having alternate poles, opposite to which, and at a very short distance,
are placed three other electro-magnets so arranged with opposing poles
as to form three nearly closed circuits.     Coils of wire are made to
revolve so as to cross the intervals between these opposing poles, and
the electric currents induced in the moving coils are made to pass
round the electro-magnets.

   2. This record was obtained by means of the following agency. My
friend, Mr. W. H. Cole, M.A., audibly counted seconds, and named the
minutes as completed, from a large chronometer, before which he was
comfortably seated, say six feet from the equatoreal. Baboo Cally
Mohun Ghose, with paper and pencil, took up a position by my side;
he mentally followed Mr. Cole's counting, and noted down the instant
I  made a remark, together with the words                 I  uttered. In the absence
of remarks, the Baboo noted the number of each complete minute as
it was declared, a reckoning which was checked by inspection of the
chronometer and otherwise from time to time, so as to render the
adoption of a wrong minute practically impossible. Thus all that re
mained for me to do was to look intently through the telescope of the
equatoreal and declare exactly what               I  beheld.     We three individuals
were all enclosed within the canvas walling of an observatory tent

302                    On the Transit  of Venus.              [Nov. 20,
progress across the sun's disk   I had as satisfactory a view of it as
was possible. My son was with me. At 6.56 we noticed the sun
light on the snowy range. Ten minutes and twelve seconds after that
we saw the rim of the sun rising above the mountain which intervened
between us and the horizon. We kept an eye on Mussoorie and
Landour, and thought they had but two minutes' advance of us in
seeing the sun. Eighteen minutes and ten seconds after our first
glimpse of the sunlight, Venus began nibbling at the rim of the sun.
Between this and her entire entrance on to the disk was twenty-seven
minutes and ten seconds; that is, we saw her external contact at
 7° 14' 10", and her internal contact at 7° 41' 20". When she was
about half way on, we both noticed a fringe of white light illuminat
ing that rim of the planet which was yet on the dark sky. When she
went off, we noticed the same fringe of light, but for a much shorter
time, and when only about one-eighth of her had passed the sun's
disk. The internal contact for departure took place at 11° 30' 15",
and the external at 11° 57' 25", as near as it was possible to say, for
there was a sort of flickering, which rendered it difficult to fix on the
 precise moment of contact.
   “The spots on the sun were but insignificant, in magnitude about
 the same as yesterday, though in position very different.”

W.     “Preliminary Report to the Committee on Solar Physics
        on the evidence in favour of the Existence of certain Short
        Periods common to Solar and Terrestrial Phenomena.”
        By BALFOUR STEwART, F.R.S., Professor of Natural Philo
        sophy in Owens College, Manchester, and WILLIAM DoDG
        soN. Communicated to the Royal Society at the request of
        the Committee.        Received October 23, 1879.
    1.  In a previous report to this Committee (“Proc. Roy. Soc.,”
vol. xxix, page 106) we exhibited a method of detecting the
unknown inequalities of a series of observations, and we gave some
evidence that the temperature-range and the declination-range at Kew
Observatory are both subject to the same short period inequalities, the
particular periods investigated being those around 24 days.
    To confirm this evidence we have extended our researches, although
in a subject of such magnitude they must still be regarded as of a
preliminary nature. In our present paper we investigate after the
method described in our first report the following ranges:—
    I. Diurnal   Ranges of Temperature   of Air at

    III.  Sun-Spot Inequalities of the period of 24 days as far  as this may
be   obtained from existing records.
  . For the Toronto ranges we are indebted to the kindness of the
Council of the Meteorological Office, and of Mr. Kingston, Director
of the Toronto Observatory. We have extracted the Utrecht and
Prague ranges from the published records of these observatories,
while for the Kew declination-ranges, including disturbances, we have
to thank the Committee of the Kew Observatory.
    2. To begin with the Toronto and Utrecht temperature ranges,
these have been treated exactly in the way in which we treated the
Kew temperature-range, so that it will only be necessary to exhibit the
result of our treatment in tables which correspond with Table VI of
our previous report.

   4. It will be noticed that there is a very striking likeness between
the three vertical columns in Table III.                      This will be seen more
distinctly by reference to Plate 1, in which figures 2, 3, and 4
represent the numbers of these three columns; fig. 2 denoting that

 1879.]         Report    to the Committee on     Solar Physics.          307
for Kew, fig. (3) that for Utrecht, and fig. 4 that for Toronto.
 This means that the temperature-ranges at these three places when
treated in a precisely similar manner indicate the existence in each of
inequalities of the same periods. The results are not, however, pre
cisely the same for each, which may perhaps be accounted for by
certain local influences which have not been entirely obliterated, but
which might be overcome by a longer series of observations.
    The sums of the three vertical columns too are not very different
 from each other.        We have, Kew=98247, Utrecht=101284, and
 Toronto–84173, a result which might seem to indicate that the
magnitude     of these inequalities      is nearly the    same   at the three
stations.   All this is in favour of their cosmical origin.
    5. The next point is to obtain the average results for the three
observatories. To obtain this it will not answer to add the three
columns together horizontally, and then divide by 3.             For although
these  periods  may   have a cosmical     origin,  and be due to the sun, yet
the   corresponding    phases    may not be simultaneous at those places.
Indeed, this is rendered probable by the fact observed by Toynbee and
others that certain weather changes which are in a sense caused by
the sun appear to travel from west to east. Now, if we should find
that these inequalities take the same course it is not impossible to
imagine that they may be allied to, or even in a sense identical with
those other well-known changes of weather. We may be as it were
on the track of those changes which may perhaps be due to solar
inequalities.                                           -
    6. How then are we to decide whether the various phases of these
inequalities occur at Toronto before they occur at Kew P or occur at
Kew before they take place at Utrecht P in fine, how are we to ascer
tain that these appearances travel from west to east P
    This may be ascertained in the following manner. Any one of the
numbers in Table     III  is the sum of the 24 terms of an inequality which
have been added together without respect of sign. Thus the number
for 0.0 is for Kew, 3912; for Utrecht, 2586; for Toronto, 3428.             It
does not, however,      follow that if we add algebraically together the
three   inequalities   corresponding    to these three numbers, we shal
obtain an inequality the sum of whose terms shall be equal to the
sum of these three numbers. For the three inequalities, even if pre
cisely the same in type, may not have their corresponding phases
occurring together. The signs of the numbers we add together may
therefore sometimes be different, and we shall then have to subtract
the one from the other. Thus again if there be a want of simultaneity
of phase in two such inequalities, the algebraic addition together
of the two will give a result less than the sum (without reference to
signs) of the 48 terms, and this falling off will be greater the greater
the want of correspondence in phase.              Now let us regard Kew as

308                    Prof. B. Stewart and W. Dodgson.                     [Nov. 20,
our             We have in all 27 inequalities between –7.0 and
       base station.
+6.0, the sums of which represent the numbers of the vertical
column headed Kew in Table III. In like manner for Toronto we
have 27 similar inequalities. Let us now add together algebraically
the inequalities of Kew and the corresponding inequalities of Toronto,
under the supposition that the phases are simultaneous at the two
places.  We thus get a series of 27 inequalities representing the
united result of the two observatories. Treating these in the same
way in which single observatories are treated in Table III, we
get 27 sums, and now finally let us add these sums together. We
get in this particular instance, Kew.--Toronto=133657.          Let us
next, on the supposition that a phase at Toronto occurs 6 days earlier
than the corresponding one at Kew, rectify this by pushing each
Toronto inequality 6 divisions to the right before adding it to the
corresponding Kew inequality.       Obtaining as before 27 sums and
adding them together, we get as a result 141794.
   This then is greater than the result obtained by adding the                        in
equalities together as they stand, and would seem to indicate that by
means of thus pushing Toronto to the right we are bringing the phases
more nearly into accordance with one another.
   7. In the following table we have exhibited the results obtained by
this method of treatment.

  It  thus appears that we get the greatest sum, and consequently the
nearest approach to similarity of phase when we push Toronto for
ward, or to the right, 8 divisions—in other words similar phases take
place at Toronto about 8 days before they take place at Kew.
   Viewing Kew as our standard, we have in like manner compared
Utrecht and Kew together. And just as we might expect Toronto to
be before Kew, so we might expect Utrecht to be behind            will     it.   It

     It
      thus appears that we get the greatest sum, and consequently the
nearest approach to similarity of phase when we push Utrecht back
wards or to the left a little more than 1 division, in other words
similar phases take place in Utrecht about a day and a-half after they
take place in Kew.

therefore push Toronto 8 divisions to the right, and Utrecht 1

  11.    The results of Table                 VIII are              exhibited graphically in Plates 2
and 3.
   It will be seen that there is a striking likeness between the corre
sponding inequalities of the various observatories.      Of these Kew is
perhaps most like the mean, while Utrecht follows next in similarity;
Toronto is least like, but even here the similarity is very apparent.
   12. Before leaving this division of our subject we have one remark
to make.    We do not suppose that certain solar inequalities only affect
directly some particular region of the earth from which they are
propagated, say from west to east. It seems to us more probable that
any solar inequality affects directly     the various stations.     all
                                                                  But                                                    at

      ofthese has the period                  The temperature-range

 316                    Prof. B. Stewart and W. Dodgson.                                       [Nov. 20,
   It   will   be    noticed that the sums 96820                      and 937.39 are not far
different from those of the temperature inequalities given in Table III,
a result which would appear to indicate that for the purposes of this
inquiry it is better not to eliminate disturbances.
   16. In a paper puplished in the “Proceedings of the Royal Society”
(No. 192, 1879), by Balfour Stewart and Morisabro Hiraoka, certain
evidence is given that variations of magnetic declination, or what we
may call magnetic weather changes, occur later in point of time at
Trevandrum, in India, than at Kew, the difference being 9.7 days.
   We are thus led to ask whether in our present investigation the cor
responding phases may not be somewhat later at Prague than at Kew.
Taking Kew as our standard, and applying the test already fully
described in Article 6 of our present communication, we obtain the
following result:—
Table   XII.—Algebraic sum of Kew and Prague Magnetic Inequalities.
       Kew and Prague (Prague                  1 division to right)            . . . .     =170005

   It would     appear from this table that the phases of the various mag
 netic  inequalities       occur at Kew nearly one day before the advent of
 the corresponding phases at Prague.
   In combining together the results of the two observatories, let us
 therefore push the Prague inequalities one division to the left.
    17. When this is done, we obtain the following table:—
  Table   XIII.—In         which Kew and Prague are added together as now
                         described and the sums divided by 2.

318                 Prof. B. Stewart and W. Dodgson.               [Nov. 20,
   The results of Tables    XI  and  XIII are   exhibited in Plate 1, where
fig. 5 denotes the mean     curve of magnetic    periods, fig. 6 the curve of
Kew, and fig. 7 that of Prague.       It will be noticed that these three
curves are extremely like one another. It will also be noticed that the
meteorological periods A, D, E, F, are well reproduced in the magnetic
curves, while, however, the two peaks, B and C, appear to be squeezed
together into a table-land.      We think that this want of similarity of
these two peaks is probably due to certain local influences which we
have not been able to overcome, through the comparative paucity of
our observations. Leaving out of account this table-land, we may now
compare together the four magnetic inequalities A, D, E, F, with the
corresponding meteorological ones.
   This is done in Table XIV, which is precisely similar in construction
to Table VIII.
   The results of this table are graphically represented in Plates 2 and 3.
While there is a very striking likeness between the corresponding
magnetic inequalities, there is also a very considerable likeness between
the various corresponding magnetic and meteorological inequalities
representing periods A, D, F. There is not, however, a strong like
ness between those representing E.
    18. But here it is well to bear in mind that, while we should expect
our method to indicate the various natural periods, whether in sun
spots, meteorology, or magnetism, it does not necessarily follow that
the magnetic inequalities should be coincident in phase with the
meteorological ones.      For instance, it is not necessary that the 24-day
 magnetic inequality at Kew should coincide in phase with the 24-day
 meteorological inequality; for if it be true that in magnetism we have
 at once a 24-day inequality, simultaneously affecting all stations,
 influencing the earth as a magnet, in whatever way the influence is
 produced, and also something more allied to the meteorological ine
 qualities, travelling from west to east, having likewise a 24-day period,
 then it is quite conceivable that the superposition of these two mag
 netical causes should produce a period also of 24 days, but differing in
 phase from the corresponding meteorological period. It will be noticed
 that we do not presume to assert that the magnetical phenomena
 are as we have just stated, but only that they may be so, and hence
 that a coincidence in phase of the two curves, magnetical and
 meteorological, is not a necessary consequence of the existence in
 these two phenomena of a common inequality, having a period of 24
 days.
    19.  Owing to the present imperfect state of sun-spot recorsd, we
 have not been able to obtain trustworthy results for the 16 years for
 which we have discussed the other phenomena.              The researches of
 Dr. De La Rue and his      colleagues  have,  however,  given  us the means
 of exhibiting certain provisional results, extending throughout the 10

years from 1858 to 1867.              These we have treated precisely in the
method already indicated, that is to say, grouping them in periods of
24 days, and obtaining yearly results. The only difference in treat
ment is that we esteemed it superfluous to apply any equalisation to
the sun-spot records, as the yearly results were sufficiently marked
without this process.
   This has furnished us with the following table, analogous to Table                   I
(see next page):—

   The results of Table XVI are graphically represented in Plate 1,
fig. 8. It will be observed that there is a very striking likeness between
the solar inequalities and those indicated in meteorology and mag
netism; but, as we have said before, owing to the imperfection of
solar records, this can only be regarded as a provisional result.
   We have not attempted in the meantime to discuss the individual
solar inequalities or to represent them in the form of curves.
   21. Let us now endeavour to bring together the various results of
our present communication.
   (1.) The temperature-ranges at Kew, Utrecht, and Toronto exhibit
certain common periods (around 24 days).
   (2.) Of the curves embodying those periods that of Kew is most
like the mean, and that of Toronto least so.
   (3.) Similar phases appear to occur at Toronto 8 days before they
occur at Kew, and occur at Kew one day before they occur at Utrecht.
   (4.) Correcting for these differences of phase, the individual in

equalities at Kew, Utrecht, and Toronto are very like the mean of the
three and like each other.
    (5.) Of these the Kew inequalities         are most like the mean, and
the Toronto least so.
    (6.) The declination-ranges at Kew and Prague exhibit certain
common periods which we may regard as the same, or very nearly the
same, as the meteorological periods above indicated.
    (7.) Similar magnetic phases appear to occur at Kew about one
day before they occur at Prague.
    (8.) Correcting for this difference of phase, the individual inequali
ties at Kew and Prague are very like the mean of the two, and like
each other.
    (9.) There is  also a less  striking likeness between      the various  mag
metical and the corresponding meteorological inequalities.
    (10.) Provisional sun-spot records appear to show certain solar
inequalities very like the magnetic and meteorological inequalities in
point of period.
    22. In conclusion we would express our hope that steps will be
taken to ascertain what information exists in the world available for
these researches,    and also to bring such information together for the
purpose of a further and more complete discussion of the laws now
indicated.

    This investigation was undertaken in the hope that, by an examina
tion of the conditions of liquid matter up to the “critical” point,
sufficient knowledge might be gained to enable us to determine under
what particular conditions liquids are dynamically comparable, in order
that the microrheometrical method" (which the Royal Society has
done one of us the honour of publishing in the “Philosophical
Transactions”) might be applied to determine their molecular mass
and energy relations.       It seemed that as the laws relating to gases
and    liquids merge   at what was called by Baron Cagniard de la Tourt
 “l’état particulier,” and by Dr. Andrews; the “critical point,” an
examination of matter up to the limit of the liquid state would be

  ful directions   so kindly furnished us by Professor Stokes, and find that
  it shows the     phenomenon    in a marked manner, whether dissolved in
  alcohol or ether.     The compound is easily decomposed by heat under
  ordinary circumstances, and yet can be dissolved in gaseous menstrua,
  and raised to a temperature of 350° without suffering any decomposi
  tion, showing the same absorption spectrum at that elevated tempera
  ture as at 15°.
     We considered that it would be most interesting to                examine by
 this method a body such as sodium, which, besides being                an element,
 yields in the gaseous state sharp absorption lines. An                opportunity
 seemed to be afforded by the blue solution of sodium                   in liquefied
 ammonia, described by Gore,” but we found that, on raising the
 ammonia above its critical point, the sodium combined with some con
 stituent of the gas, forming a white solid, and yielding a permanent
 gas, probably hydrogen.                                                 -
     There seems, in some cases, to be a slight shifting of the absorption
 bands towards the red, as the temperature rises, but we have as yet
 been able to make no accurate measurements.
     When the solid is precipitated by suddenly reducing the pressure, it
 is crystalline, and may be brought down as a “snow ’’ in the gas, or on
 the glass as a “frost,” but it is always easily redissolved by the gas
 on increasing the pressure. These phenomena are seen to the best
 advantage by a solution of potassic iodide in absolute alcohol.
     We have, then, the phenomenon of a solid with no measurable
 gaseous pressure, dissolving in a gas, and not being affected by the
 passage   of its menstruum through the critical point to the liquid state,
 showing     it to be a true case of gaseous solution of a solid.

        By CHARLES TOMLINSON, F.R.S. Received October 6,
        1879.
     I propose    now to state the general conclusions at which               I have
arrived since     resuming   the study   of this  subject    two years ago.  #   The
remarks that will be made refer to solutions of the typical salt, sodic
sulphate, in the proportions of 6 of salt to 3 of water.
    In my first two papers on supersaturated saline solutions, a nucleus
is defined as a body that has a stronger adhesion for the salt, or for
the liquid of a solution, than subsists between            the salt and the liquid.

      1879.]            Mr. C. Tomlinson             on the     Action     of   Nuclei.                       327
      Many examples are given in which oils, fixed and volatile, alcohol,
      ether, &c., spreading on the surface of the solution, lead to the separa
*~,   tion of salt, and the solidification of the solution; while, if such liquids,
      instead of spreading, assume a lenticular form, they become inactive,
      and by shaking the flask with a circular motion, are dispersed through
      the solution in numerous globules, without any immediate nuclear
      action.
         There are several circumstances which favour the action of these
      liquid nuclei, such as (1) chemically clean flasks and solutions, so as to
      maintain (2) the surface-tension of the solution as high as possible, in
      order to spread the oils; (3) bright and clear weather, with strong
      evaporative force. Under such conditions the oils, &c., usually form
      films with nuclear action.
*       But it has been shown that in closed flasks, with special precautions
      against the entrance of particles from the air, the oils, &c., may be
      made to spread on the surface of these solutions without any nuclear
      effect.
         The negative results arrived at by M. Viollette, Mr. Liversidge, and
      other eminent observers, led them to conclude that oils, alcohol,
      ether, &c., as well as porous bodies, have no action whatever on these
      solutions, and that the only nucleus is a salt of the same kind as the
      one in solution, or isomeric therewith ; and that, when the oils, &c.,
      appear to act they really contain particles of such a salt; or when the
      flask is uncovered for the purpose of introducing the oil, &c., such a
      saline speck enters from the air, which is supposed to contain saline
      nuclei floating about in         to it.
         The objections made      my mode      experimenting,
                                                       of        well      my        as                 as   to
      conclusions, were fair enough, since,      my experiments always con

what is the peculiar function of                                   ozone        in rendering oils, &c., active,                             as
nuclei?
   It is evident, from the behaviour of ozone on volatile oils exposed to
its influence that its action is an oxidising one, diminishing their
cohesion, just as rust weakens the cohesive force of the particles in a
bar of iron.
     The effect which ozone produces quickly on a volatile oil is pro

 1879.]               Mr. C. Tomlinson       on the     Action of Nuclei.                            329
that solid bodies, boiled up with the solution, are inactive; and have                         I
found them to be so when put into the hot or warm solution, and left
till cold; and that oils and other liquids, boiled or heated with the
solution, become equally inactive.    Several observers, who have more
or less recently worked on the subject before us, have not attended to
this condition, and hence, obtaining negative results, have declared
that the oils, &c., have no nuclear action under any circumstances.
   If, however, a nucleus from without be introduced into the cold
solution, a nucleus that is capable of adhering to the salt and not to
the water of the solution, a molecule of the anhydrous salt is thereby
set free, and in the very act of separating, ten atoms of water enter
into combination, and thus determine the solidification of the whole
of the solution in the form of the normal salt.*
     If
      the nucleus fail to catch one of these saline molecules, as it were
in the nascent state, but disperses through the solution, its  effect is to
lessen the adhesion between the water and the     salt,  and a portion of
the seven-atom salt is liberated  (mostly at the bottom of the vessel,
where the solution is richer in salt) provided the temperature be not
too high: this effect is also produced by cold alone.
     If
      an essential oil, which acts as a nucleus in determining the
formation of the normal salt, be submitted to distillation, the distillate
reassumes its cohesive force, and when added to the solution, is no
longer active, seeing that whether in the lenticular form, or dispersed
in globules, it has a separate existence of its own, the lens and each
minute globule being bound up in their own surface tension, which
prevents them from coming into contact with the salt.          however,               If,
    drop     oilof
                 spread                 upon               the solution,
                                                                              it of
the                     out into   film a    the surface
the cohesion     so far weakened that adhesion between
                     is                                     and the salt
becomes possible, separation usually takes place, and large crystals                                    of
the normal salt mould themselves on the under surface of the film.
    If
     such       the true explanation,
                 be                            clear that any other force
                                                   it   is
which diminishes           or
                       destroys the cohesive force     the oil, must confer
                                                                   of
upon      the same nuclear
          it                  property.   Consequently,    freshly distilled
                                                                        a
essential oil, mineral naphtha, &c., which are inactive, become active
by the addition        little absolute alcohol, ether and similar liquids
                          of   a
in which   they are soluble.
  The fixed oils which tend          become rancid through age are also
                                        to

the bodies examined by them, and obtaining only negative results, and
always a certain result with a crystal of the salt, they have insisted
that this is the only nucleus. Others, again, have sought for an
explanation in some catalytic or other mysterious force; while a third
set of observers have declared it to be a matter of uncertainty or
hazard whether a foreign body acts as a nucleus or not. In reviewing
the subject and repeating my experiments in various ways,      see no                                         I

nuclei is simply mechanical, and is capable of being expressed by the
familiar word adhesion.

involving elliptic functions certain special methods which have been
employed for the evaluation of integrals of a similar kind involving
circular functions.

which are in fact Mr. Roberts's results (“Liouville,” t. xii, p. 456).
In the “Philosophical Magazine,” for December, 1860," Professor
Sylvester has given the values of two integrals which are equivalent
to (5) and (28). The method depends upon an expansion in a series
and is quite different to any employed in this paper. Professor
Sylvester notices particularly the fact that the values of the integrals
in (5) and (28) should be equal in magnitude.

IX.     “Walues of the Theta and Zeta Functions for certain Walues
        of the Argument.” By J. W. L. GLAISHER, M.A., F.R.S.,
        Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Received July 31,
        1879.
    § 1. In § 12 of the preceding paper “On Definite Integrals involv
ing Elliptic Functions,” it was necessary to determine the values of
e(#K), e(#K+ iK'), 6(#K'), 0(K+#K'), and 6*($K+#K'), which
were required in the evaluation of some of the integrals.                     This led me
to calculate a table of the values of the 6 and H functions when the
arguments were of the form K+ ni K', for the values 0, #, 1, #, of
m and n, and the results are contained in this paper. For the sake of
completeness the corresponding values of the Z function are also
given; and some remarks connected with the q-series to which the
formulae lead are added.
    A table of the values of the sn, cn, dn for the above-mentioned
arguments is given by Professor Cayley on page 74 of his “Elemen
tary Treatise on Elliptic Functions” (1876): this table" is so useful
that it seemed desirable to supplement it by a similar one for the 6,
H, and Z functions.
    § 2. The values found in § 13 are

  I  have considered this subject at length on account of a remark of
Professor Stokes, that sin (2n +3)6—sin (2n+1)6 cannot converge to
zero in the ordinary manner, on account of the perpetual fluctuation of
the signs of sin (2n+3)6 and sin (2n+1)0.        There can only    think                               I
be one  explanation  of this, namely, that the sine of an infinite angle
is zero. Following up then the theorem we find

       F.R.S., Professor of Organic Chemistry in Owens College,
       Manchester.    Received August 2, 1879.
                                                         (Abstract.)
   The isomeric monochlorides, obtained from the normal paraffins exist
ing in petroleum, yield by the abstraction of hydrochloric acid a
mixture of olefines, one portion of which readily combines with hydro
chloric acid in the cold, whilst the other unites with it only on
heating.*
  The chlorides formed in the cold boil with partial decomposition
and at a lower temperature than the others, which distil without
undergoing any change, and have the general formula
                                      CH3–CHCl–C,                      H2n+1.t
They are therefore derived from the olefines of the series
                                       CH2=CH-C, H,                         11.
Similar results have              been obtained                by     Le   Bel:
  The constitution      the olefines combining with the acid
                                 of                               the cold                                in
is  not yet known.      They are possibly not derived from normal
paraffins, but from isomerides, which cannot           separated from the              be
former  by distillation. On the other hand their formation can also
be explained without making this assumption.           This question can
only be decided by using                   an
                               absolutely pure paraffin.S
   For this purpose, normal hexane from mannite was selected, which
possibly might yield three isomeric monochlorides:
                     (1.) CH-CH2—CH3–CH2—CH2—CH2Cl
                     (2.) CH-CH2—CH2—CH2—CHCl–CH,
                     (3.) CH3–CH-CH3–CHCl–CH2—CH2

of common occurrence. The one is that of ordinary increase, as
exemplified by the growth of population, where an already large
nation tends to become larger than a small one under similar cir
cumstances, or when a capital employed in a business increases in
proportion to its size. The other category is that of surrounding
influences, or “milieux’’ as they are often called, such as a period of
plenty in which a larger field or a larger business yields a greater
excess over its mean yield than a smaller one.    Most of the causes
of those differences with which sociology are concerned, and which
are not purely vital phenomena, such as those already discussed, may
be classified under one or other of these two categories,   or under such
as are in principle almost the same.    In short, sociological phenomena,
like vital phenomena are, as a general rule, subject to the condition of
the geometric mean.
   The ordinary law of Frequency of Error, based on the arithmetic
mean, corresponds, no doubt, sufficiently well with the observed facts
of vital and social phenomena, to be very serviceable to statisticians,
but it is far from satisfying their wants, and it may lead to absurdity
when applied to wide deviations.     It asserts that deviations in excess
must be balanced by deviations of equal magnitude in deficiency

measurements will disagree among themselves, but on arranging them
in order of size they show a tendency to cluster round some medium
value. We are naturally inclined to infer that the true value of
the unknown, or typical member of the class, is not far from this
value.  How to define and determine the appropriate medium in
various classes of measurement becomes thus a natural object of
inquiry.   On examination we find that there is no strict and final
criterion applicable to all cases. We have to start with an empirical
assumption, more or less justifiable on general grounds, but not
capable of rigid proof.    In the ordinary Theory of Errors, which deals
primarily with discrepant observations, the assumption made is re
ducible to this:—that, on the whole, the best medium we can take is
the Arithmetic Mean of the discordant                 This is equivalent
                                                                     measures.
to the statement that errors (or differences from the truth) of equal
amount in excess or defect are equally likely to occur. In the class of
measures referred to by Mr. Galton, which are not of the nature of
instrumental observations, reason is given for thinking that, on the
whole, a better medium value is likely to be obtained by taking the
Geometric Mean of the discrepant measures.     This is equivalent to the
assumption that measures are equally likely which bear to the truth
ratios of equal amount in excess or defect, so to speak. For example,
that measures which are respectively (####)th and (####)th of the
truth are equally likely to occur. This paper seeks to develop some
consequences of this fundamental principle.
   The practical outcome is a method for the treatment of a series of
measures which naturally group themselves round their Geometric
Mean.    This method may be briefly presented as follows:
   Let the measures be
                                 *1, 4'2, "3           .     .   .        .   'n'
Take the (hyperbolic)            logarithm of each measure, thus forming a new
series, say
                       y1, y2   y;    .       .    .       yn; where yr=loge                  ar.
Form the Arithmetic Mean (A.M.)                             of   the a's,         so   that
                                              n(A.M.)=>z.
                                                      the y's: this will                be    the logarithm
                                              of of
Form the Arithmetic Mean                                                                                       of
the Geometric Mean (G.M.)                             the a's,   thatso
                                      n       log (G.M.)=>y.
If    them
             #    =:   (log (A.M.)—log (G.M.)), we have                                  in   h
                                                                                              a     “measure   of

     The series    of    y's may then             be   treated       as       a   series grouped round         its

cable to any series of measures of which the mean and the weight are
known, we must suppose the value of p to be given (either graphi
cally or by table) for all possible values of w. In other words, we
must suppose the number of entries to be indefinitely great and
indefinitely close together.  It is clear that the actual probability of
any individual measure becomes in such a series infinitesimal, though
the relative magnitudes of any pair of probabilities remain unaltered.
This is indicated in the formula of $2 by the constant B becoming
infinitesimal.   To avoid this inconvenience we are led to modify our
original problem, and ask, not “what is the probability of a measure
a P” but “what is the probability      of a measure lying between the
very close limits a and a +ów P”
  4. From the principle indicated above, viz., that on the whole there
are as many measures less than the mean as there are greater than
the mean, we deduce that the required probability is

the constant factor h--V7 results from the condition that the
sum of all the values of this function from a = 0 to a = do must be
unity.          And it will       be found that

    In young   animals portions of this gland are sufficiently thin to allow
 them to be viewed by transmitted light in their normal state.
    With care the gland of a narcotised animal can be stretched out and
 looked at without injury to the blood circulation.      The rapid capillary
 current continues for     many  hours  shooting   around and between the
 alveoli.   Stimulation of the sympathetic nerve in the neck, besides

   causing a secretion in the glands, produces the most striking effects on
  the blood circulation; the current all but ceases.
      The resting gland thus viewed shows alveoli, in which the
  boundaries of the cells are faintly marked out by light lines between
  the many granules that fill the cells. The granules stretch from
  lumen to basement membrane. No nuclei are to be seen in the
  alveoli, nothing but a mass of not very refractive granules with an
  indistinct network of light lines which mark the separate cells.
     The secreting gland similarly viewed strikes the eye at once as being
  much more transparent; with a low magnifying power, the lobules
  even when thick, are no longer the dense dark masses of the resting
  gland. With a Zeiss D or E objective, it is seen that this is caused by
  the disappearance of the granules at the outer part of the alveoli, the
 part near the basement membrane. The later the stage of secretory
 activity, the larger the non-granular clear zone. It is however only in
 the earlier secretory stages that the clear portion is in the form of
 a ring in section, later the clear zone dips down at fairly regular
 intervals towards the lumen. The granules thus acquire a star
like arrangement. This comes about in the following manner:—As
secretion goes on, the cells draw away from one another slightly at the
lumen, and at their sides contiguous to the lumen (perhaps because
they are there being used up): so that the lumen can be more or less
 distinctly seen with short prolongations running out between the
cells; at the same time the granules disappear more rapidly from the
interior than from the periphery of the cells, hence the granules become
arranged in a clump at the luminar margin, and stretch out from this
some little distance along the cell sides.
     The rather troublesome method given above is not necessary for
the observation of the living condition of the tissue; small pieces cut
out and mounted without the addition of fluid preserve for a short
time very closely their normal appearance. If to such a specimen
any of the ordinary indifferent fluids be added, the granules become
more highly refractive, and later a thorough alteration takes place in
the cells, the granules originally present to a large extent at any rate
disappear and others are formed.
    A very satisfactory and economical method of noting the changes
which take place in the gland during secretion, is to narcotise an
animal and then to snip out small bits from various parts of the gland
at different stages of sympathetic stimulation or pilocarpin injection.
The alveoli, at first granular throughout, become less and less so, until
hardly any granules are to be seen.        At this later stage very little
saliva can be obtained.
    The cells, during the process of losing their granules, become
much smaller; the reparation is not sufficient to cover the waste.
    I may remark that it does not necessarily happen that every hungry

rabbit has parotid alveoli throughout granular, the secretion is not
solely dependent on feeding, but in whatever stage the glands are at
the beginning of an experiment, they become less granular after
having been made to secrete.
    Ihave said that the changes can be seen either after sympathetic
stimulation or after injection of pilocarpin.   This is noteworthy, since
Heidenhain,”    dealing with alcohol-hardened       specimens,  failed to
observe  any of the changes   after pilocarpin injection, which he could
obtain by stimulation of the sympathetic nerve.
   The appearances in the gland described above are not observed in
alcohol-hardened specimens.
   It will be remembered that Heidenhain describes the secreting
gland as being, in alcohol specimens, more granular than the resting:
this  depends on the relative amounts of cell substances soluble and
insoluble in alcohol.
   Treated with osmic acid and subsequently with alcohol the gland
has a markedly different appearance in the resting and active state.
   In the resting state the alveolar cells viewed with a Zeiss F have
a close-meshed network throughout.      The nuclei are fairly apparent,
evenly stained, rather compressed, and peripherally placed. With
Zeiss D the cells appear densely granular.                          -
   In the active state the punctated look caused  by a network and in
terfibrillar substance of differing staining power is absent, the cells
stain fairly evenly throughout, thus the nuclei are with difficulty seen;
they are spherical, and are placed more in the middle of the cell.

  Nussbaum * found that the transition cells stained black with osmic
acid, whilst the alveolar cells were but lightly coloured.   His con
clusion from this that the transition cells formed the ferment was .
contested by met on the ground that if the gland were treated with
alcohol before treating with osmic acid, the transition cells did not.
stain black, and that it was highly improbable that the ferment had
been dissolved by alcohol.  Nussbaum, in a later paper: upholds his
opinion and rejects my argument on the ground that he can obtain a
substance from the gland which is insoluble in alcohol, and which yet
does stain black with osmic acid, this substance being the ferment.
   It is a matter easy to decide; a fresh gland is placed in absolute
alcohol for twenty-four hours; sections are made and placed in
osmic acid one per cent, for the time mentioned by Nussbaum,
viz., two hours, and examined. The whole has a yellowish-brown
tint, the transition cells are but a trifle more deeply stained than
the alveolar cells; they have to be looked for instead of striking
the eye in the manner they do when the gland is treated with osmic
acid first and alcohol afterwards.   A stay of twenty-fours in the acid
does not materially alter the appearances.       It     perhaps, hardly        is,
necessary       bring forward my original argument; for numerous
               to
later experiments have shown me that the prominence        the transition               of
cells and their   depth         of

with alcohol rather than    the prior treatment with osmic acid. The
                                     on
gland, placed   osmic acid one per cent, and that only, for two
                    in
hours, has the ducts darkest stained, the transition cells are
slightly deeper tint than the alveolar cells, mainly because the former
                    in
are evenly stained throughout, whereas the latter are not; both are
yellowish-brown.     One, two,                 or

 382           -      On the Structure    of Serous Glands.         [Nov. 27,
 show differences similar to those described above for the parotid under
 similar circumstances. In early digestive stages, however, the granules
 appear sharper and more refractive, the distinctness of the cell net
 work depends largely on the alcohol treatment.          .
    I can confirm the observations of Bermann" on the presence of a
 “tubular gland” in the sub-maxillary of the rabbit. The large lumen
and small cubical epithelium of the majority of the tubes do not
suggest that it has any important secretory function.
           The Infraorbital and Lachrymal Glands of the Rabbit.
   In  these   glands the two zones in the secretory condition are even
more conspicuous than in the parotid.         Even more readily too than in
parotid can lobules thin enough for observation be obtained.
   In different animals the alveoli may be granular throughout, or
may have a more or less distinct outer non-granular zone.                 But
whichever condition occurs the granules can always be diminished by
setting up a secretion with pilocarpin. A similar change,        I think, too,
occurs on stimulation of the     sympathetic.
   These glands are distinguished from the parotid and sub-maxillary
by preserving fairly their normal aspect after osmic acid and alcohol
treatment. The resting gland is not unlike, in chief features, the
resting parotid; the network is particularly obvious.
   When a clear zone is present in the fresh state it stains easily with
osmic acid, showing ordinarily no network; with a small non-granular
zone the granular zone appears as a network in the preserved specimen,
as the former increases the latter appears more granular and less as a
network.     In activity the nuclei become spherical, move towards the
middle of the cells, and become less conspicuous.
   Recalling what has been said of the parotid and sub-maxillary
glands, it will be seen that in these, as well as in the infraorbital and
lachrymal glands, the alveolar cells in the secreting condition stain
much more homogeneously with osmic acid than they do in the
resting condition.     In the two latter glands the homogeneous staining
corresponds in extent with the clear zone of the fresh specimen, in
the parotid this is to a slight extent only the case, in the sub
maxillary gland scarcely at all.        I  am inclined to think that by a
modified use of osmic acid, the normal appearances in all these glands
may be more nearly preserved than is commonly the case, though,
undoubtedly, a great part of the divergence mentioned above in their
behaviour in the secretory state, depends on a chemical difference in
the substances broken down and re-formed.
   The investigations, of which the foregoing is a brief account, were
carried on in the Physiological         Laboratory of the University of
Cambridge.

      The CEsophageal   Glands of the Frog.     (Rana temporaria.)
   In a frog three to four days after food the acini of the oesophageal
glands in the living state are granular throughout, and so thickly
granular that the outlines of the alveoli are but faintly indicated, the
outlines of the cells not at all seen, nor are there any indications of
nuclei.
  Shortly after food is given, the granules thin away at the peri
pheries  of the alveoli and so render the alveolar outlines more
obvious.   This thinning proceeds so rapidly that in a few hours there
is a well-marked clear zone in the outer part of each alveolus, the
part nearest the basement membrane.
   Later the clear zone becomes larger, the granular zone becoming
smaller, but as the clear zone enlarges it ceases to form in section a
ring, it dips down into the granular zone at intervals, or in other
words, the cells in using up their stored granules do not all use them
up at the same rate, some are more energetic than others, so that the
granular zone takes in section a somewhat star shape. In addition to
this, the star-form of the granular zone is aided by the granules
along the margins being less readily used up than those in the
interior of the cells.
   Nuclei are as little seen in the digesting as in the resting gland.
The glands having then as digestion goes on got rid of a large number
of their granules, proceed to form others as digestion ceases. The
clear spaces between the points of the star are filled up, and the clear
zone forms granules from within outwards, until the granules once
more extend to the basement membrane.
   An indication of the changes taking place in the alveoli of the
glands can be seen in the oesophagus itself with the unaided eye; in
a hungry frog the oesophagus is an opaque white, in a digesting frog
it is greyer and more transparent.
   Frogs in anill state of  health    do
                                      not show the full granular con
dition characteristicof  the hungry frog, the granules are much less
numerous, and often, indeed, do not extend        the basement mem
                                                  to
brane; with these, however,      as   with healthy frogs,       the granules
diminish during digestion.
  The granules we have hitherto spoken     of   may    be   called   “central”

                                 distinguish
        beneath the              basement membrane.     These “border” granules are
        smaller and              more highly refractive; they occur usually in small
        clumps.
           The points mentioned above as observable in the fresh tissue, can
        also in the main be observed in glands treated first with osmic acid
        and then with alcohol. There are one or two things to be noticed in
        sections of glands so treated. The border granules stain more deeply
        and readily than the central granules. The mucous cell. granules
        have disappeared, the cells present the usual characters of a mucous
        cell in hardened specimens.      In the resting gland the nuclei are
        generally hidden; in the digesting gland the nuclei are large, spherical,
        situated in the clear zone, with faint outlines; the nucleolus is deeply
        stained and prominent.      In the digesting there are fewer obvious
        mucous cells than in the  resting  gland.                   -
           Nussbaum" has made some observations on the glands treated with
        osmic acid; it will be noticed that we differ from him in almost every
        respect.          -
           Swiecickit found the glands after treatment with alcohol, to be,
.
        in ...the digesting state as a rule, larger, more granular, and better
        staining. The greater granulation here obviously only means that in
    -   the digesting state there is a greater amount of substance precipitable
        by alcohol in the granular condition. The cells when alive are less
        granular during digestion.
           Partsch,+ working also with hardened specimens, found the glands
        to increase in size as they secreted, but only for the first 5–10 hours.
           Whilst not prepared to deny that an increase of size may in the
        first stages,        place, we have failed to observe       and are inclined   it,

seen. A peripheral very finely granular almost homogeneous part.
   The necks of the glands are finely granular, with scattered small
dark granular patches. By treatment with 33 per cent. potash and
other re-agents, it can be seen that the dark granules are contained in
the chief-cells; the outer finely granular or clear portion of the glands
being the border-cells. At the outer border, the outlines of the border
cells can be well seen; at the junctions of the cells, however, the
outlines disappear. No nuclei are visible.      The small dark granular
patches in the necks of the glands are found to be also the chief-cells
which are here and there scattered amongst the border-cells.
   The pyloric glands in the fresh state are fairly transparent, finely
granular to homogeneous. The lumina are usually distinct, and often
stretch up between the cells; apart from this no cell outlines are visible.
No nuclei are to be seen.

glands; except that he mentions the nuclei of the border-cells as being
normally just visible.

coarsely granular.
  Yet Heidenhain,     Ebstein, Grützner, and others, who advocate the
identity of the chief-cells with the pyloric gland cells, do not seem to
have noticed the difference existing between the two cells in the
fresh state.  The difference                 is,

  deeper parts of the glands than those also taking a thin rim or star
 arrangement.
    3. The Lesser Curvature. The glands here have the character given
 above for pyloric glands.
    4. The Pylorus. The glands are simply shallow depressions of the
 mucous membrane, and are still more transparent than the glands of
 the smaller curvature.
    In hunger the opaque thickly granular region encroaches on the
 greater curvature.
    In digestion the granules diminish, beginning at the opaque part
 near the greater curvature, so that the opaque thickly granular region
 is more and more limited to the extremity of the fundus.
    As far as concerns the diminution of the coarse granules of the
 chief-cells during digestion, this is but a repetition of what we have
 already said of the dog, cat, and rat. The point of additional interest
 is this. Sections of alcohol-hardened fragments of the greater curva
 ture show that here, as well as in the fundus, there are a large number
 of chief-cells. Probably no one examining such sections of the greater
 curvature would consider them as other than typical fundus glands
 with chief-cells and border-cells. Yet the former cells in the fresh state
 do not contain the coarse granules characteristic of chief-cells.
    Deferring for a moment the consideration of this, we would mention
 some experiments we have made on the amount of ferment-content of
 the various parts of the rabbit's stomach.
    Equal-sized pieces of the mucous membrane of a rabbit were taken
 and put in absolute alcohol.       A. From the fundus. B. From the
greater curvature.     C. From the smaller curvature, including part of
 the pylorus.     These were kindly tested for ferment by Mr. Sheridan
 Lea, of Trinity College, both by the ordinary digestive method and by
 Grützner's colorimetric method.       The result was that A contained
more ferment than either B or C.; B and C contained a not very
different amount, B rather more than C.
    Now A contained border-cells and coarsely granular chief-cells; B
contained more border-cells than A, but chief-cells with scarcely any
coarse granules; C contained only pyloric cells, with possibly here
and there a solitary border-cell.
    Hence the part with the pre-eminently large number of border-cells
offered hardly appreciably more pepsin than the part containing few,
if any; the conclusion that the border-cells do not form pepsin appears
to us unavoidable.
   Moreover     a comparatively  very large amount of pepsin was con
tained in the     part of the mucous membrane with a densely granular
chief-cell.   This,  we think, is enough to connect the ferment with
these granules; in this opinion we are confirmed by the result of the
following experiment. Two rabbits of the same breed, and in all

388                        Baron Ettingshausen.                  [Nov. 27,
respects as much as possible alike, were taken; one was killed hungry,
i.e., twenty-four hours after feeding, the other in full digestion some
5–6 hours after a plenteous meal. The gastric mucous membrane
showed the usual difference to the unaided eye and to microscopical
examination; equal-sized pieces were removed from as near as possible
a corresponding position of the fundus of each animal.           They were
tested by Mr. Lea for ferment, the resting more granular piece was
found to possess a not inconsiderably greater amount of ferment than
the active less granular piece.      We may recall that Grützner found
the amount of ferment to diminish during digestion.
    There is one other fact which leads us to connect the chief-cell gra
nules with the ferment; in protracted hunger the chief-cell granules,
instead of increasing diminish, as we have mentioned above, occurs in
the newt; according to Grützner, in protracted hunger, the ferment
content of the gastric mucous membrane diminishes.
    To return to the consideration of the meaning of the finely gra
nular chief-cells of the greater curvature. These differ but little,
histologically,  from the pyloric gland cells.    Both form pepsin.    Such
close similarity in form and function justify us in considering them to
be fundamentally the same kind of cell.          How, then, do they stand
related to the  coarsely granular chief-cells? The distinguishing features
of the latter are their coarsely granular appearance and their large
ferment-content; in an extreme digestive stage these features become
much less conspicuous. We are led, then, to think that the coarsely
granular chief-cells are but a more highly developed form of the cells
found in the other parts of the stomach as the finely granular chief
cells and pyloric gland cells.                                              -
   The   greater   curvature of the rabbit    probably  corresponds  to the
intermediary portion of the stomachs of dog, cat, and rat.
    It will be noticed that in the main we advocate Heidenhain’s views,
objecting, however, to the statement that the chief-cells and the pyloric
gland cells are identical, since their normal appearance is so strikingly
different.
    The investigations, of which the foregoing is a brief account, were
carried on in the Physiological    Laboratory,   Cambridge.

tion generally, is the London Clay of the Isle of Sheppey, in which are
found great numbers of plant remains belonging to many different
kinds of fossil fruits and seeds. After an examination of the rich
collection in the British Museum,      I feel now sure that we possess, in
the fruits and seeds of Sheppey, the key to a more precise determina
tion of many of the genera and species of fossil plants which in other
localities are known only by their leaves.
    The literature of the Sheppey fruits is not very extensive; a detailed
account of all the works relating to it is published in Mr. Gardner's
“Introduction to our Monograph on the British Eocene Flora.”
Palaeontographical Society, 1879, p. 11.          The only work on this
subject with scientific determinations, and which need here be referred
to, was published in the year 1840 by James Scott Bowerbank, and is
entitled   “A   History of the Fossil Fruits and Seeds of the London
Clay.”     He enumerates twelve genera, which are divided by him into
nine families.     The genera are as follows: Nipadites, Hightea, Petro
philoides, Cupressinites, Cupanoides, Tricarpellites, Wetherellia, Cucu
mites, Faboidea, Leguminosites, Mimosites, Xulinosprionites. Of these
only one (Nipadites), belongs to the Monocotyledons and one (Cupres
sinites) to the Gymnospermae, while the rest are Dicotyledons.
    I am now able materially to advance the knowledge of this Flora.
Since my investigations in the course of the winter 1878–9, at the
British Museum,     I  have ascertained that the Fossil Flora of Sheppey
contains, including those above mentioned, at least 72 genera and
200 species, which may be distributed into 41 families.           Of these
genera one belongs to the Thallophyta, 7 to the Gymnospermae, 18 to
Monocotyledons, 43 to the Dicotyledons, and 3 are indeterminable.
    The existence of this Flora and generally of the Eocene Flora of
Great Britain required, we believe, at least, a sub-tropical climate. This
is indicated by many of the ferns and palms, and by the Musaceae,
Pandanae,    Cinchonaceae, Loganiaceae,   Sapotaceae, Ebenaceae, Büttneria
ceae, Sapindaceae,   &c.
    Some only of the fossil fruits and seeds of Sheppey can be placed
in living genera, but with regard to the rest, forming a considerable
part of these, it was impossible, notwithstanding a careful comparison.
I  therefore assume that some of the fruits and seeds belong to genera
 which no longer exist in the present Flora of the world.      In several of
these extinct genera, however,     I  recognise their affinity with living
genera, or at least determine the family to which they belong.       I have
expressed this in the name of the genus. But with many even that
was impossible, and these     I have placed in the meantime under the
provisional    name Carpolithes.      It is an important fact that the
number of such extinct forms is relatively much larger, than it is in
any of the already known Miocene Floras.            I have also discovered
fruits, but chiefly leaves belonging to many of the genera of the

390                       Baron Ettingshausen.                  [Nov. 27,
Sheppey Flora in the Fossil Floras of Bournemouth and Alum Bay in
the collections of the British Museum, and that of Mr. John Starkie
Gardner, indicating that in age these are not far removed. It is well
known that the Sheppey Flora preceded the other two. The genera
which,   I feel sure, are common to Sheppey and Bournemouth are:
Sphaeria,    Sequoia, Cyperites,    Smilax, Sabal, Iriartea, Aronium,
Quercus, Juglans, Liquidambar, Proteoides, Laurus, Nyssa, Cinchoni
dium, Apocynophyllum,         Sapotacites, Diospyros,     Magnolia, Acer,
Sapindus, Cupania, Eugenia, Eucalyptus, Metrosideros, Bauhinia.
   I  believe that even some species of these genera are the same
in both Floras. It is surely probable that the fruits and seeds of
Sheppey were related to the leaves found at Bournemouth and Alum
Bay; and it would be, therefore, undesirable always to propose separate
specific names for the related fossils found in these different localities.
   Among the plant-fossils of Bournemouth and Alum Bay               I  also
found many leaves which        I  could not class with existing genera.
There is probability that these partially correspond with the extinct
fruit- and seed-genera of Sheppey.
   Before  I  enumerate the genera and species of the Fossil Flora of
Sheppey,    I have to remark as follows:–
   Amongst the Sheppey fossils are now and then found fragments of.
the basis of the leaf of a palm, probably of Sabal major.       On such a
fragment    I found the apothecia of a Sphaeria.    Of the Gymnospermae
of Sheppey there were found fruits and seeds of the Sequoia Bower
bankii, also fragments of twigs.       The seeds of the Cupressineae and
Abietineae had lost their wing-like expansions, which shows that the
fruits and seeds of Sheppey were carried some distance in water, con
sequently their delicate membranous wings were injured and broken
off by rubbing.     There are therefore no perfect winged fruits and
seeds to be found.    In fact, even the firmer wings of the Acer-fruit
have been entirely lost, and it is impossible to determine the species
of the Acer-nucules, which remain.             -
   The appearance of the Salisburia seeds is interesting.        They are
very remarkable for their sharp, prominent edge.               The easily
determinable leaves of this    genus   have not as  yet  been found in the
Eocene Flora of Great Britain.
   The Agave is indicated by     a valve of fruit; Smilax, of which leaves
are not unfrequently found at Bournemouth, is indicated by a berry.
Of Musa, of which only leaves had as yet been found, there are
seeds.    Of Amomum, two kinds of fruit have          been  found. These
have hitherto been mistaken for smaller fruits of the       Nipadites.    Of
particular interest are the many species of palms. The fruits and
seeds of some, for instance, Sabal major, Trinax Bowerbankii, Elaeis
eocenica, Iriartea striata, Livistona eocenica, bave been found.     Of the
Sabal and Iriartea the leaves are found at Bournemouth.          The   Elaeis

eocenica, the most common palm of the Sheppey Flora, is nearly
allied to the E. melanococca, and the Livistona eocenica to the L.
chinensis.
  I  do not yet know whether the Aroidea seed, which I have placed in
Aronium, might be united with the Aroidea leaf of Bournemouth.
On the other hand, I think it is very likely that some of the kinds of
oak fruits correspond with some of the kinds of oak leaves, which are
to be met with at Bournemouth.     Two of the Bournemouth species are
also found in the Miocene   Flora, and one of these, Quercus Lonchitis,
also in other Eocene Floras.
  A  small nut shows all the characters of the Corylus, which is found
in the Miocene Flora. The absence of the Fagus is very remarkable,
as two kinds of leaves, which can only belong to this genus, have been
found in Bournemouth.        Fagus is frequently found in the Miocene
and  Post-Tertiary   formations,  and also in the Cretaceous formation,
and   Ibelieve, therefore, that it may still be found in Sheppey.
   The Liquidambar-fruit of Sheppey hay belong to the same species
as the inflorescence of Liquidambar, which              I
                                                 found amongst the fossils
of Bournemouth.       The  Laurus-berry,   which            I
                                                     have found amongst
the Sheppey fruits, is placed by me in Laurus Lalages, the leaves of
which have been not only found in Bournemouth, but also in the
Austrian Eocene (Sotzka, Haering), where they occur associated with
berries.
   The occurrence of a species of Nyssa, I think, may be also accepted
for the Bournemouth strata. Of the Proteaceae, besides Petrophiloides,
a seed belonging to the Proteae occurs, perhaps corresponding with
the leaf which I have seen among the fossils of Alum Bay. In Bourne
mouth and Alum Bay were found the seeds of some other Proteaceae
which are not in Sheppey, as they have delicate wings.   Some of the
cones referred by Bowerbank to Petrophiloides belong to Sequoia.
  The Gamopetalae are represented by many genera, of which almost all
appear also in the Miocene Flora. The fruit of Cinchonidium of Sheppey
and the leaves of a species of Cinchonidium from Bournemouth may
belong together.              I
                   accept the same for the Apocynophyllum fruit of
Sheppey and the corresponding leaf of Bournemouth.        This last
accords in all        its
                 characters with   Reussi, which also appears

   The theta-functions, although arising historically from the elliptic
functions, may be considered as in order of simplicity preceding these,
and connecting themselves directly with the exponential function
(e" or) exp, a : viz., they may be defined each of them as a sum of a
series of exponentials, singly infinite in the case of the single functions,
doubly infinite in the case of the double functions, and so on. The
number of the single functions is=4; and the quotients of these, or say
three of the functions, each divided by the fourth, are the elliptic func
tions, Sn, cm, dn: the number of the double functions is (4*=) 16; and
 the quotients of these, or say fifteen of the functions, each divided by the
sixteenth, are the hyper-elliptic functions of two arguments depending                                                       .

deduced the wave-lengths 4543.6, 4540.7.        The lines 45439, 4540-2
in the “normal solar spectrum” probably represent this pair.
   The ninth group      again    diffuse pair for which we deduced, by
                                   is               a

manganese line 4495, appears nearly coincident with the more re
frangible     them. Lines nearly corresponding
              of                                        these are   the           to                    in

  The tenth group    again   more sharply defined pair, for which,
                               is               a                                                                 by
measurements from calcium and iron lines, we found the wave-lengths
4423,4419-5.  The lines 2656:7, 26649     Kirchhoff's map    the solar of                         of
spectrum may represent this pair.
  The eleventh group      very diffuse pair, sometimes seen
                                    is   a                       con                                   as

tinuous band dividing                    as
                           the sodium evaporates, for which we found
the wave-lengths about 4393, 4390. There         line corresponding         is
                                                                             a                                    to
the former    the “normal solar spectrum,” and Kirchhoff's line 2709:6

   The twelfth group      diffuse but narrow band, which we have not
                                   is   a
seen divided.    The middle          has  wave-length about 4343, very
                                                   of  it         a

                                     a                  iron line, and       to   be   an
rather more   refrangible than    chromium line 4344'5.

   The thirteenth group is              a diffuse broad band nearly bisected by the
iron line 4325.
  The successive groups             become        fainter and more diffuse as they are
more refrangible, at the same time the distance between successive
groups diminishes.    Their positions are shown on the accompanying
diagram to a scale of wave-lengths.     It is worthy of note that every
alternate group is much more sharply defined than the others. More
over, it is only the diffuse groups (3) (5) (7) which show reversal
except the first group, in the orange, which, however, is more difficult
of reversal than the others. The whole series, exclusive of D, looks
very like repetitionsof the same set of vibrations in a harmonic pro
gression; the first  (visible) term consisting of the six vibrations
represented by the   orange pair (6160, 6154) and the four lines of
group (3); the next term of the five lines of the fourth and fifth groups,
one of the six vibrations being now too faint to be seen; the next
three terms, of each of which only four lines are visible, consisting of
the sixth and seventh, and eighth and ninth, and the tenth and
eleventh groups, and the last term of the two faint bands of the
                                               -
twelfth and thirteenth groups.
   Simple harmonic relations can be found to subsist between some of
the groups; for instance, the wave-lengths of the fifth, seventh, and
eleventh groups are very nearly as '5:                  I's      *,

    Between the first and second group Lecoq de Boisbaudran gives a
line which was not noticed by us in the arc.
    In the second group the two middle lines are very close, and Lecoq
de Boisbaudran gives only their mean wave-length.         Measuring the
distances of the middle from the extreme lines of the  group,  the wave
lengths of this quartet are 5355, 5338, 5334.5, 5319.      These are all
about of equal brightness, but we have not seen the third (5334.5)
reversed.
   The third group consists of the lines 5112,5098, 5095,5081.         Of
these the second is not given by Lecoq de Boisbaudran, and only the
first has been seen by us reversed.
    Three lines given by Lecoq de Boisbaudran between the third and
fourth groups are not seen in the arc, or at least are not nearly so
conspicuous as the groups here described.
    The fourth group consists of lines for which we find the wave
lengths about 4964, 4956,4950, 4942.     Of these the first and last only
are given by Lecoq de Boisbaudran as 4963 and 4936.
    The fifth group has lines of which we find the wave-lengths about
4870, 4863, 4856, 4850.
    The sixth group has lines of about the wave-lengths 4808, 4803,
4796, 4788.
    The seventh group is too faint and diffuse to be distinctly resolved.
The wave-length of the least refrangible edge is about 4759.
   None of these last three groups are seen by Lecoq de Boisbaudran,
and they are too diffuse for exact measurement; on the other hand, he
gives several other lines which are not noticed by us in the arc.
   As in the case of sodium the repetition of these quartets of lines at
decreasing intervals with decreasing brightness and sharpness as they
proceed from the less to the more refrangible, gives the impression of
a series of harmonics; but the wave-lengths do not seem to be in a
simple harmonic progression, though simple harmonic relations may
be found between some of the groups.

lines were many times observed, and we noticed that the reversals

momentarily only, 51.55, 5238,5256.     Besides these, many dark bands
were observed in the less   refrangible part of the spectrum, of which
three, with wave-lengths 5920, 6035, 6060, appear to be identical with
bright bands ascribed to strontia, and one, with wave-length 6597, is
identical with a bright line given by strontium chloride.
   Manganese, introduced as sulphate, gave with facility the violet
triplet, 4029, 4032, 4033 as dark lines on the continuous background.
The bright blue lines of manganese were not, however, reversed until
some   metallic magnesium was introduced.         This brought out the
reversal of the lines, wave-lengths 4753,4783, and 4823, the last being
the most easily reversed of the three.
   Lead introduced in the metallic state gave a reversal of the violet
line, wave-length 4058, which Cornu had previously seen reversed, but
this reversal was far better seen, becoming a wide black band, when
the lead was introduced as an alloy with zinc.         Probably the lead
vapour was not so rapidly oxidised when mixed with zinc, and a
thicker, if less dense, stratum interposed between the arc and the spec
troscope. When lead ferrocyanide was used, not only the line above
mentioned was reversed, but also much less strongly, a line near                        it,

wave-lengths 4810, 4721, were seen reversed. The very bright lines,
wave-lengths 4924, 4911, seen         the spark between zinc poles, were
                                            in

sium line, wave-length 4481, and the cadmium lines, wave-lengths
5377, 5336.
  When cadmium was put into the crucible the lines, wave-length
5085, 4799, and 4677, were reversed, not the line, wave-length 4415.
With   alarge dose    cadmium the red line, wave-length 6438, was

the intervals and    interpolating,   we deduced 4211:3 for the wave
length  of this silver line, which we could see, though           was fainter,

the appearance of these two lines, or bring out a reversal of either
of them. We failed to see any line of silver either bright or re
versed with wave-length about 4240, as mentioned by Cornu, whether
the silver were used pure or alloyed with zinc or with lead. With
the carbons arranged vertically as shown in our last communication
on this subject, p. 472 (vol. xxviii), and the light viewed through the
perforated carbon, silver gave a channelled spectrum as described by
Lockyer and Roberts. As this channelled spectrum was not seen with
silver in any other arrangement of our crucibles, we are led to attri
 bute it to a comparatively cool condition of the silver vapour ascending
the carbon tube, a condition of near approach to a state of liquefaction,
   Having observed that lines frequently came out with mixtures
which were not visible when the separate ingredients were used, we
tried a few amalgams. None of these showed any reversals of the
mercury lines.      But an amalgam of bismuth gave readily the
reversal of the bismuth line, wave-length 4722, and with more difficulty
                                                      -
that of the line, wave-length 4119.
   Antimony did not appear to give any lines, or none easily dis
tinguishable, in the arc.
   With copper we observed the reversal of two lines only, wave
length 5105, 5153.
   Iron introduced as metal, or as chloride, in the usual way, gave us
no reversal; with an iron rod used as positive pole instead of one
of the carbons, we succeeded in getting the reversal of one line, wave
length 4045, which expanded and showed a fine dark line in      middle; its
but by passing an iron wire into the arc through the positive carbon,
which was perforated           in

                                                   the iron lines.  The
three violet lines, wave-lengths 4045, 4063, 4071, were the first              to   be
reversed. They all expanded before showing reversal, and the order
of reversal was that      refrangibility. Besides these the lines, wave
                           of
lengths 4957, 4920 (the stronger and less refrangible       pair), 4404,

   Tin, palladium, and platinum gave no reversals.
   It is worthy of remark in regard to the difficulty of obtaining sub
stances chemically pure, that we found that carbon poles which had
been for some hours ignited in a current of chlorine and further in
tensely heated in the arc, while chlorine was passed through perfora
tions down their axes, still showed in the arc, of course without any
crucible being employed, a multitude of lines, amongst which the so
called carbon lines and those of calcium and iron were conspicuous.

 GENTLEMEN,
 IN the spring it is our duty to elect into the Royal Society our
 annual complement of new Fellows, and at our early summer meet
 ings we admit to our ranks the young and vigorous in the career of
 science. But in the autumn, or fall, as on the other side of the Atlantic
 it is so aptly termed, it is our custom to recount the names of

408                              Anniversary Meeting.                                 [Dec. 1,
those who have dropped from our list. Some of these have fallen in a
plenitude of years, and in maturity of mind: others in that early stage
of youth where insight and imagination, as yet scarcely differentiated,
have both lent their aid to the first flights of thought. Which of these
classes we can best afford to spare is hard to say; but whether it be
the one, or whether it be the other, it is certainly the case that the
number of those whom we have thus lost since our last anniversary has
been unusually great; it has in fact reached a total of twenty-nine on
the home, and two on the foreign, list. Many of them find a place
among the obituary notices which appear from time to time in our
Proceedings; but there are a few, of whom, from personal knowledge,
                                                           I
or from special interest in their works, am led to make additional,
although passing, mention here.
   In looking over the list we are reminded in a striking manner of a
fundamental difference between the Royal Society and the Academies of
the Continent, a difference which may perhaps be the best described by
the term comprehensiveness. For, beside the class of Fellows selected,
in accordance with our recent legislation, from the members of the
Privy Council, it has always been our custom to gather into our ranks
not only men of eminence in science proper, and in subjects which border
on it, but also men      of
                         distinction     other paths
                                                in      life, provided that
                                                                          of
they have followed those paths             on
                                     principles which are analogous     our                to
own, and which by        no
                        undue strain        the analogy
                                                     of may   themselves be
called scientific.
  In   illustration of this remark,    might point
                                           I           the present list

                                                to            those who have   to
honourably served        various departments
                        in                         the public service,
                                                               of         the              to

poses for the welfare        the people. And although the act
                             of                                       erasing        of

    In the category of men of cultivation and leisure, who have turned
their attention with good purpose and success to scientific pursuits, we
may fairly reckon our late Fellow John Waterhouse, of Halifax.
    Sir Thomas Larcom was one of a long series of distinguished men who
have been elected Fellows of the Royal Society from the Corps of the
Royal Engineers. Travelling beyond the strict limits of his profes
sional career, he endeavoured to give to his official work a wider range.
And it was due to suggestions emanating from him that the Irish
Survey was so extended as to make it the opportunity for collecting a
great variety of local information, history, language, and antiquities,
and that the map became the admiration of scientific travellers.
    Mr. Bennet Woodcroft's name will always be associated with the
foundation of that important department the Patent Office, with its
Library, and Museum, of which he was the first executive officer.
    Professor Kelland and Mr. Brooke were among our veterans in the
Society, and many of us will long recollect the lively interest in science
which the latter showed during his frequent attendance at our evening
meetings.
    In Mr. W. Froude, to whom one of the Royal Medals was awarded
in 1878, the Society, the public service of the country, and science in      *
general have sustained a loss which at one time would have been
irreparable, and which even now, when his work has become an
                                                                    -
 established science, is difficult to replace.                             f
     Of Professor   Clifford,  and the   gap   which his death has caused
 among our friends and the world of science at large,      I know not how
 to speak.    His mathematical papers are being collected by a careful
 and trusty hand, while his philosophical remains have been given to
 us by one who knew and loved him as he deserved.             To the same
 friend we owe the memoir of his life, written indeed so far as that life
 can ever be written, but reminding us also at every line that his life
 was one the full story of which will always seem but half told.
     If in Professor Clifford we have lost one of our youngest, in Sir
 J. G. Shaw-Lefevre we have lost one of the oldest of our mathematical
 Fellows.     Born before the present century, and Senior Wrangler at
 Cambridge before many of us were in existence, he seems to belong to
 a past age. But through a long and honourable course of unusually
 varied and responsible public life he always retained his interest in
 mathematics, and, himself no mean geometer of the old school, he had
 in his later years projected and actually begun a new edition of the
 works of Archimedes.        Of his labours in connexion with University
 College, and afterwards with the University of London, all who are
 interested in liberal education will retain an appreciative and grateful
 memory.
     Our last loss, that of Professor Clerk Maxwell, has been in some
 respects the greatest.     In  him the full maturity of a mind which had

foundation of a more thorough knowledge of Molecular Physics and
of Electrical Laws than has hitherto been attained. The clear insight,
the keen criticism, the just and liberal appreciation of the views of
others, evinced both elsewhere and especially in his Reports to the
Committee of Papers, will long be remembered; while the more
general side of his character, exemplified in the numerous scintilla
tions struck       off
                  with his pen, will                  be

from the increase of scientific communications, and the larger expense
now incurred for illustration, it is much to be desired that augmenta
tions to the Fund may be actually made.                                -
   As the period seems now to have arrived for improving the value of
the estate at Acton belonging to the Society, by applying the whole or
a part of it to building purposes, it may be well to say a few words
with regard to this property.
   The capacity to purchase and hold lands, the Statute of Mortmain
notwithstanding, was granted to the Society by charter soon after its
foundation, and subsequently, under George the First, a special
licence to purchase in mortmain to the yearly value of £1,000, and to
 receive lands, tenements, rents, or hereditaments by will or any deed
of  conveyance, was granted by Letters Patent.       In 1731, when the
Society had some money to invest, an estate of a good title near Fulham
was mentioned as a suitable investment by the President, Sir Hans
Sloane; and in June, 1732, a freehold farm, the estate of Mr. Pannet,
of Kensington, having a dwelling-house and out-houses, with about
forty-eight acres of arable land, was recommended for purchase by
Mr. West. In the following month the purchase of this estate at
Acton was settled, the purchase-money being £1,600, but Mr. Pannet
agreeing to lay out £30 on repairs. The total rent at that time was
3.65 per annum and a quit-rent of £1.4s. In 1772 and 1774 the house
and four acres of land were sold for £620.      Another plot was sold in
1792.    In 1858 the estate, which at first consisted of many separate
plots, was consolidated under an award of the Enclosure Commis
sioners, and within the last few years other portions have been sold to
the North and South-Western Junction Railway, and for the purpose of
erecting a church, parsonage, and schools. The sums received from these
various sales have been considerably in excess of the £1,600 originally
paid for the estate, so that the thirty-four and a half acres which,
until within the last few months, remained the property of the
 Society, and produced an annual rent of £170 per annum, had practi
cally cost the Society nothing.    During the present summer the rail
way company, being desirous of constructing a station upon the
 estate, purchased somewhat more than an acre of our land; but it
has been thought desirable to devote a portion of the purchase
 money to buying a strip of land to give access to a part of the
 estate, the only approach to which was by a level crossing over the
 railway, which the company wished to close. The lease of the
 whole property will shortly fall in, and, in re-letting              it,
                                                                provision

found desirable to lay out additional roads at the expense of the
Society. There appears, however, to be every probability that, by
selling and letting various plots on the estate, the eventual income of
the Society from this source may be materially increased.
    Besides the estate at Acton, the Society is possessed of a small grazing
farm at Mablethorpe, in Lincolnshire, and although this has been let
to a substantial tenant at a moderate rent, it seems not improbable
that our income so arising may, like that of many others, be affected
by the prevailing agricultural depression.        The amount, however, is
in this case comparatively small.
    Legacies.—Under this head I have the pleasure to mention two impor
tant contributions to the Society's funds. First, an unconditional be
quest of 1,000l. by the late Mr. Sydney Ellis, of Leicester; and secondly,
a legacy by the late Sir Walter Trevelyan, “the interest of which is
to be applied to the promotion of scientific research.”        The object of
this last bequest appears to be almost identical with that of the
Donation Fund; and the name of our benefactor may not improperly
be associated with those of Wollaston the founder, and of others who
have from time to time contributed to augment that fund.
    The Royal Society, as is well known, possesses a rather extensive
gallery of portraits, almost exclusively of Fellows of the Society, but
among them also a fine painting of Lord Chancellor Bacon.             Many of
these portraits, however, have, through the lapse of time, begun to show
signs of decay. Acting under the advice of Mr. F. W. Burton, F.S.A.,
Director of the National Gallery, the Council has entrusted the
pictures which seemed most to require attention to the care of Mr.
Dyer, of Orchard Street, who is now engaged upon them. Some of
the portraits require lining, and others cleaning, or partial restoration.
As will be seen from those which have been returned to their places,
the work appears to have been done in a satisfactory manner.              The
present appearance of the pictures has been much improved, and it is
hoped that these interesting portraits of those who have gone before
us may now be passed on in an unimpaired condition to future genera
 tions.
    Among other acquisitions to the Society's property,    I  would call the
 attention of the Society to the collection of no fewer than 973 portraits
 of Fellows of the Royal Society, formed by the late J. P. Gassiot, Esq.,
 F.R.S., and bought during the past year.            The collection consists
 mainly of engravings; many of which are of great artistic merit, and
 in excellent condition. It is to be hoped that the existing Fellows
 will aid in completing and continuing this interesting       series,  by con
 tributing engravings or     even  photographs of themselves or of other
 Fellows, as occasion may offer.
    Mention should also be made of a bequest by the late Mrs. Faraday
 of “a book containing the numerous diplomas and other documents of

1879.]                                   President's Address.                                          413
honour and compliment conferred on, or addressed       -  to her late hus
band, Michael Faraday.”
   (2.) Regulations and Procedure.—At the last anniversary your late
President explained the changes then in progress for the abolition of
entrance fees, and for reduction in the annual payments made to the
Society by the Fellows.                  I
                             have now only to add that the alterations
in the Statutes, necessary for carrying this out, have been completed.
   During the past year a small but perhaps not unimportant change
in the mode of dealing with the papers to be read at the weekly
meetings has been made.     This consists first, in deciding a week earlier
than heretofore, what papers should be advertised for reading; and
secondly, in reading each week as many as practicable of those in hand,
so as to leave as few as possible to stand over. The weekly journals
are now able to announce to the public the papers which will be read
at the Royal Society (as has in fact long been the case with other
Societies) during the next week. But the main object of this arrange
ment has been early publication; that is to say, publication both in                                    its
                    reading before the Society, and           more widely          in   its

scientific famine, and that occasions     might   occur when the Society
would meet with        papers before

catastrophe has never yet       actually   occurred.    But, more than this,

                                                      in            may have                he

                                         of

equally sure that all those who have been present at those their vivá
voce expositions will join with me in an expression of our sense of
the obligations which they have thus conferred upon us.
   Of the utility of printing copies of the abstracts of papers in time
for the meetings, and of circulating copies to the authors themselves,
I  myself entertain no doubts. But it must still be admitted that full
use of these facilities has hardly yet been made, and that the dis
cussions on the papers have not apparently been much promoted by
them.        I
          trust, however, that the authors of papers and others who
may attend our weekly meetings will endeavour to make every use of
facilities which are afforded at a not inappreciable cost to the Society.
   There is a possible alteration in our arrangements which has often
appeared to me to be worthy of consideration, and which from con
versations with some of our Fellows appears to meet with sufficient
support to justify my bringing it before this our anniversary.  refer                         I
to the hour at which our weekly meetings are held. Hitherto, in
accordance with the usage of Scientific Societies in London, we have
met in the evening.    But changes in the habits of society, and the
increasing distances from Burlington House at which many of our
Fellows reside, seem to render a large weekly attendance difficult.
On this account it appears to me desirable to inquire whether an
afternoon hour might not better suit the convenience of our members.
                       I
In that case, should suggest 5.0 P.M.; and as our meetings seldom
extend to two hours in duration, it would generally be practicable for
Fellows to reach home by about seven o'clock.
    Ishould, however, much regret if any such change should deprive
us of the pleasure and of the substantial benefits arising from the con
versations in our tea room. And, having this in view, would suggest            I
that on Thursday afternoons tea should be prepared an hour before
the meeting, so as to give opportunity for conversation to such of our
Fellows and their friends as might be disposed to avail themselves of                                 it.
   Under such an arrangement for our weekly meetings,               would                it
doubtless         be

                                if                                  the                       of

adopted before the end of the year, there would still remain nearly
half the Session of our Society after complying with the necessary
formalities.
  At  the risk of becoming tedious on matters of internal detail,           I
venture to mention another subject.       It has often been suggested
that our  weekly meetings   might   be rendered more interesting if the
communications were more often accompanied by experiments, or by
other modes of optical illustration. The Council has hitherto met
these requirements by supplying, from time to time, such appliances
as appeared necessary.   But that important element, the electric light,
and batteries on a large scale, have generally been avoided, on account
of the inconveniences attending them. It has, however, been thought
that authors would be much encouraged to illustrate their communi
cations experimentally if the main appliances were known to be always
ready to hand.
   Again, the mode of lighting our meeting-room by means of sun
lights has proved inconvenient to many of our Fellows, on account of
its heat and glare; and it is considered undesirable to adopt ordinary
gas-burners in its stead for fear of injury to the pictures.   We are,
however, no longer driven to this alternative, as we may now look to
the electric light as a possible mode of illumination.
   These considerations have led me to make an offer, as           I
                                                             now do, to
the Society, of a gas-engine of eight horse-power, which, in the opinion
of those best qualified to judge, will be amply sufficient both for ex
perimental illustration and for illumination.       And        I
                                                            have much
pleasure in adding that, on hearing of this offer, our Fellow,
Mr. Siemens, immediately expressed his wish to add a dynamo
machine, or rather a pair of such machines, of improved construc
tion (one for alternate, the other for direct currents), the principle
of which he had already contemplated bringing before the Society.
The other requisites, such as an optical lamp and a few instruments
of frequent use, will doubtless soon follow.     But, in proposing
thus to  promote   experimental  illustration of papers read before
the Society,          I
                think it right to add that I do not contemplate,
nor   do   I
           think it desirable, that the Society should in any sense
establish a laboratory; all that is here intended        is,
                                                      that the main
appliances for illustration should    found ready
                                         be         hand here, while

  If  these proposals  meet with the approbation        of the Society, the
experiment may shortly         tried; aud      have little doubt that, with

and “Proceedings,” and others may be expected to follow. These and
similar publications by other scientific societies must serve as the
main basis for forming a judgment of the value of the grants in
question, and especially of that which is technically known as the
“Government     Fund.”   But whatever be the final verdict on this

   “A   very elaborate investigation of the problem as deduced from
geodetic measurements has been made within the last few years by
our Fellow Captain (now Colonel) Clarke, R.E., in connexion with the
great Trigonometrical Survey of the United Kingdom, but including
results of the geodetic operations, so far as they bear on this problem,
undertaken by other nations and in other parts of the world.
   “The results as to the figure of the earth, deducible from pendulum
observations that had been then executed, were discussed by the pre
sent Astronomer Royal in an article published in the “Encyclopaedia
Metropolitana.       But thirty years have passed since the publication
of that  work,  during  which time very important contributions to our
knowledge of the variation of gravity over the earth have been made
by different   nations. Among them the elaborate series that was
carried on in connexion with the great Trigonometrical         Survey of
India occupies a prominent place. It appears, therefore, very de
sirable that the conclusions deducible from our present stock of
pendulum observations should be exhaustively discussed.”
   Major Herschel is on his way to England, to carry out the proposed
work.
   (5.) The Publications of the Society.—The Catalogue of Scientific
Papers.—The second volume of the supplementary decade, viz., 1863–
73, has been brought     to a close, and copies are now in the hands of
the Fellows and the      public.   It exceeds in bulk any of the earlier
volumes of the   work,  and extends to 1,310 pages. In this supplement,
343 additional scientific serials have been catalogued, making the
total of such serials now comprised in the whole no less than 1,938.
The donation list for this volume has been the same as that for
former volumes, with the addition of a few Societies and Institutions
sanctioned by the Treasury at the recommendation of the Council.
The Fellows have the right to purchase the supplement at the same
reduced price per volume as the original work.         The Council has
authorised the preparation of titles for another decade; and some
progress has already been made in the work.
   Apart from the Catalogue of Papers, the main strength of the
Library of the Royal Society consists in its collection of the publica
tions of scientific Academies, and Societies, and of scientific journals,
unrivalled anywhere in this country, except perhaps in the British
Museum.      It has always been held that the first duty of the Library
Committee is to maintain, and wherever possible to increase, our
efficiency in this respect.   As regards our general collection of books,
the Committee and Council are of opinion that it will be best to

restrict their purchases, as far as possible, to recognised         standard
works.
   The change of printers, mentioned last year in the address of my
predecessor, has as then hoped effected considerable economy; and I
should not allow the present occasion to pass without expressing the
sense of the officers of the zeal and attention shown by Messrs.
Harrison to the business of the Society. The change in question
occasioned the removal of our stock of “Philosophical Transactions”
and “Proceedings” from the warehouses of our late printer, and as
it would have been alike unnecessary and expensive to hire other
warehouses at our present printers or elsewhere, we have taken the
stock into our own custody. This has been the more easily effected,
owing to the transference of the stock of the Catalogue of Scientific
Papers to the Stationery Office.       The change has been made the
occasion of thoroughly re-arranging our stock of “Transactions” and
“Proceedings; ” a process which will always be necessary at intervals
of some years, in order to keep the stock in a satisfactory condition.
   An extra volume of the “Philosophical Transactions,” (vol. 168)
has been issued, in which the observations made by the naturalists
who accompanied the Transit of Venus Expeditions to Kerguelen's
Land and Rodriguez, and descriptions of their collections by persons
specially acquainted with the several subjects, are brought together.
The volume is divided into four sections, viz., the Botany and Zoology
of each of the two islands respectively.
   The Botanical collections from Kerguelen's Land, worked out by
Sir J. D. Hooker, Mr. Mitten, the Rev. J. M. Crombie, Dr. Dickie,
P. F. Reinsch, and the Rev. M. J. Berkeley, have added largely to our
knowledge of the Cryptogams, especially the Algae.        In particular the
American     affinity  of the Kerguelen  Flora, previously   established by
Sir. J. D.   Hooker,  in his examination of the flowering  plants, is proved
to be also very strongly manifested in the Cryptogams.
   Of the Zoological collections from Kerguelen's Land, those of the
Mollusca, Crustacea, Arachnida,         and Insecta, have yielded the
greatest number of novelties; the two former offering distinct evidence
of the affinity of this Fauna (as of its Flora) with that of South
America.      The Arachnids and Insects of the southern extremity of
America are unfortunately too little known at present to admit of a
comparison with the highly interesting new forms discovered by
Mr. Eaton, and described in this section.
   In estimating the affinities of the Flora and Fauna of Rodriguez,
the authors were under great difficulties owing to our imperfect know
ledge of the plants and animals of the other Mascarene Islands.          But
almost all their observations point strongly to the conclusion that the
present animals and plants are the remains of a once more extensive
Flora and Fauna which has been gradually broken up by geological

and climatic changes, and which more recently has been greatly                        in
terfered with by the agency of man. The greater portion of the
botanical section has been undertaken by Dr. Js. Bayley Balfour, who
himself collected the materials.   He estimates the total number of
plants  found at present in Rodriguez at 470 species, viz.:—297
Phaenogams and 173 Cryptogams; and he establishes the remarkable
fact that of the Phaenogams not less than 108 are to be regarded as
introduced into the island, and that 189 only are indigenous.  Great
interest attaches to remains of the extinct cave-fauna of Rodriguez;
and the collection made by Mr. Slater, supplied materials for three
papers by Mr. E. Newton, Mr. J. W. Clark, and Dr. Günther.     With
regard to Zoology, the marine collections were those to which least
interest was attached, as they consisted principally of common forms
spread over the whole of the tropical Indian Ocean. On the other
hand, our knowledge of the Terrestrial Invertebrates received
considerable additions, especially in the Myriopods and Arachnids,
Coleoptera and Turbellaria, described by Mr. A. G. Butler, Mr. C. O.
Waterhouse, and Mr. G. Gulliver.
   The Papers in General.—The papers presented to the Society, and
read at our evening meetings, have been more numerous than in any
previous year of our existence, and have during the last twelve months
reached a total of 118. Some of them appear to have excited unusual
interest among the Fellows and their friends; for, on more than one
occasion our meeting-room was filled to an almost unprecedented
degree.
   But, beside the interest attaching to their reading and discussion,
the papers themselves have offered some very striking features. It
would be as invidious to attempt, as it would be impossible to establish,
any general comparison of merit among so varied a collection of
memoirs; but        I
                  may still be permitted to take this opportunity of
expressing my own impressions of a few which fall, more or less,
within my own range of study.

 attained, and those in which the stratified discharge is displayed. Of the
 delicacy and beauty of the experiments it is not necessary here to speak,
for they have been already exhibited here, as well as to more than one
 audience on a large scale.   Through this advance on his part, a help
 ing hand will doubtless be held out to those who are occupied with
the subject of stratification; for in this matter, the two advancing
 powers desire neither a “neutral zone” nor a “scientific frontier”
to separate their field of action.
    Another communication, full of promise as well of performance,
 should also not pass unnoticed.     I allude to Professor Hughes' paper
 on his Induction Currents  Balance,   the application of which has already
branched out and borne fruit in more than one direction.             The ex
treme simplicity of the instruments, and their marvellous adaptation
to the purposes for which they were intended, reflect the highest
Credit on their inventor.
    Not unconnected with Mr. Crookes' researches, so far as they are
 directed towards the ultimate constitution of gases, are those of Pro
fessor Osborne Reynolds.       In his remarkable paper, “On Certain
Dimensional Properties of Matter in a Gaseous State,” Professor
 Osborne Reynolds has established the fact of what he calls Thermal
Transpiration, namely, that when two portions of the same gas are
separated by a porous plug, the two surfaces of which are of different
temperatures, the condition of equilibrium is no longer that the pres
sures of the gas on the two sides of the plug should be equal, but that
the pressure on the hotter side should exceed that on the colder side
by a certain quantity; and that if this is not the case, the gas will
transpire through the plug until this condition is satisfied.      Professor
Reynolds     connects this   principle   with Mr. Crookes' Radiometer
experiments; and the various considerations which he brings to bear
on the subject appear to have this idea throughout, that the dynamical
similarity of two gaseous systems, bounded by solid surfaces, geome
trically similar, depends on the ratio of the homologous lines of the
system to a certain quantity, having the dimensions of a line, and
which varies inversely as the density of the gas.         Although dimen
sional considerations have been shown      by  previous  writers to have an
important bearing on the Theory of Gases, still his experimental re
sults form an important contribution to our knowledge of the subject;
and in his theoretical investigation he has attacked with vigour, and
not without success, some elements of the problem avoided by his        pre
decessors in this field of research.
    Photography has of late years become so completely the handmaid
of Physical Science, and has so constantly responded to the calls of its
master, that its progress, however rapid and however effective, has come
to be taken almost as a matter of course. But the step which Captain
Abney appears now to have taken lies entirely out of the ordinary line

  I  now pass on to mention briefly a few other subjects which, out
side our immediate sphere of action, form substantial elements of the
scientific progress of the past year, and among these            I
                                                             should first
mention   Meteorology,  because the Council, to whom in this country the
subject is entrusted, is nominated by the Royal Society.
   The science of Meteorology has, during the last few years, attracted
an increasing amount of attention, more perhaps from its close relation
to the interests of all classes of the community, than from the definite
ness or novelty of the scientific results to which it has led.
   The second International Congress of Meteorology met at Rome in
April of the present year, on the invitation of the Italian Govern
ment; an interval of nearly five years having elapsed since the date of
the first Congress, which was held at Vienna in 1874. The main object
of these meetings has been to introduce greater uniformity of method
into the meteorological systems of Europe, without attempting, how
ever, to pledge the different Governments to any definite engagements
on the subject. With this view, a permanent International Com
mittee has been constituted, to furnish a point d'appui for common
action, and to facilitate, during the intervals between the Congresses,
a personal interchange          of opinions among the authorities directing the
different systems.
  A great number of valuable reports, on questions embracing nearly
the whole field of Meteorology, were received by the Roman Congress.
Among them, special mention may be made of the reports by M. Violle
on Solar Radiation; by M. Pernet, on the Determination of the Fixed
Points of Thermometers; and by Professor Everett, on Atmospheric
Electricity.               -
  A Conference        of           character, which was originated by
                           a semi-official
the Congress at Rome, was held at Hamburg in the beginning of
October, for the purpose of taking into consideration a proposal,
emanating from Lieutenant       Weyprecht and Count Wilczek, to
establish for one complete year a circle of meteorological observations
round the Arctic regions of the globe. The Conference was attended
by representatives of the Meteorological Institutes of Austria, France,
Germany, Russia, and the Scandinavian countries; and it was agreed
that an effort should be made to establish the proposed circumpolar
system of meteorological and physical observations in the year 1881.
Some part at all events of this plan will, in all probability, be carried
into effect, as the Canadian Government has intimated its readiness to
co-operate in   it,
                  and     Count Wilczek has offered himself

   The unfavourable weather which has characterised the present year,
has given an additional impulse to the study of English Meteorology;
and our own Meteorological Office has ventured to resume the issue of
Daily Forecasts of Weather, after they had been discontinued for nearly
thirteen years.  The attempt has been made under somewhat adverse
circumstances, as the uncertainty of the weather of 1879 has even
surpassed the proverbial fickleness of the British climate.       But the
experiment has been liberally supported by the Press, and has been
watched with great interest by the public generally.       Of its success
or failure it would as    yet  be premature    to speak,  but it deserves
recognition as a serious attempt to apply to one of the most uncertain
of the sciences the severe test of prediction.
   Transit of Venus (1874) Reductions.—The         calculations of every
kind relating to the five British Expeditions were some time ago con

longitudes and the discussion of the measurements of photographs.
The preparation of the Astronomical (as distinguished from the
Photographic) Observations and Results for Printing is complete for
the expeditions to the Hawaiian Islands, Rodriguez Island, and New
Zealand.    For the other two expeditions much remains to be done—
chiefly, however, mere copying.    The employment of the staff upon
the measurement, re-measurement, and discussion of the photographs,
was the most serious cause of the delay that has occurred in present
ing to the public the astronomical results. Those who are now
 engaged upon this subject entertain serious doubts as to whether
 any result of value, as regards the special object of the expeditions,
is to be expected from the photographs, owing to a want of sharp
ness in the images. Some of the photographs taken by the Russian
Astronomers" have been measured, but not very successfully.        The

of magnetic declination and horizontal force with Professor Wolf's
curve of sun-spot frequency, with the result that not only is there a
general correspondence in the two sets of phenomena, but the minor
irregularities of the sun-spot curve are reproduced in the curves of
diurnal magnetic range for both elements, and further that the well
marked annual inequality in the latter is itself variable, being greatest

   The spectroscopic determination of the motions of stars in the line
of sight by the displacement of lines in their spectra, has been recently
extended at Greenwich to stars of the third and fourth magnitude,
raising the number of stars available for the application of this
method to 200 or 300. Up to the present time, the motions of 63
stars have been thus determined at Greenwich.          Mr. Seabroke, at
Rugby, has also applied the method to 28 stars, and his results, though
presenting some discordances inter                       se,   generally support those obtained
 by   Mr. Huggins and               by

    The publication    of Lohrmann and Schmidt's Maps of the Moon
 forms an    important  contribution to Selenography.
    M. Flammarion has published a valuable Catalogue of Binary Stars,
 giving all available observations (to the number of 14,000) of these
 objects, with the elements of their orbits, so as to present a complete
 summary of their history.
    Among the more recent Institutions for the promotion of Science,
 mention should be made of the Observatories for the study of
 Astronomical Physics in France and Germany.
    The elder of these in point of date, namely that in France, although
 founded in 1876, has only quite recently been permanently established
 in the Chateau at Meudon. The Director has ever since the foundation
 been    principally occupied with solar photography, and he has esta
 blished the fact that photography is capable of revealing phenomena
 which must necessarily escape ordinary telescopic observation. In
 particular, he has succeeded in photographing the granulations pre
 viously seen on the solar disk by other astronomers; and by means of
 his magnificent pictures, one of which he has recently presented to
 the Society, he has established the existence of what he terms the
  Réseau photospherique; in other words, that the surface of the sun is
 divided into regions of calm and of activity.      His present researches
 will doubtless enrich our    knowledge  with many   new facts.
    The German Observatory has been placed at Potsdam.              In the
 selection of the locality, 320 feet above the sea, with a good horizon,
 and free from the smoke and vibration of the city, and in the
 furnishing of the Observatory, the German Government has done
 everything that could be wished. And it may confidently be hoped
 that in the hands of Professor Vogel and his colleagues much good
 work will be there done.
    The ramifications of Science are now so various in direction, so
comprehensive in grasp, and so immediate in their applications, that
they have of late years given rise to the establishment of special
 Institutes and Societies for the study and encouragement of their
respective subjects. Among these there may be mentioned the Insti
tution of Telegraph Engineers, the Iron and Steel Institute, and
others.
    At the meetings of these bodies it frequently happens that subjects
which may have, in their primary form of a scientific discovery, been
laid before the Royal Society, are brought up again and discussed
from a different point of view, e.g., in their relation to other subjects,
or in their application to the special purposes of life. For instance,
in the “Proceedings of the Institution of Telegraph Engineers” we
find the    following:--
    1. Wires which run parallel to each other for a long distance are
very much troubled by induction between wire and wire. The effect

on telegraphs is to diminish speed of working, and on telephones
to render speaking impossible.       Hughes has studied these effects in
his own    peculiar way,  and has shown how, when the number of wires
is limited and the working confined to one direction, they can be
entirely eliminated.
    2. Mr. Cowper has shown how, by producing the two rectangular
components of a plane curve at a distance, it is possible to reproduce
handwriting. His instrument works very effectively, but is still
perhaps in an early stage of its development
    3. The application of the Duplex system to long cables has been
practically and very efficiently carried out by Mr. Stearns on the
Atlantic Cable, and by Mr. Muirhead on the long cables of the Eastern
Telegraph Company in the Mediterranean          and Indian Ocean.
    4. The Electric Light is still on its trial for general street illumina
tion in Paris and London; but it has been recently very effectively
employed in surveying and sounding the Mediterranean by night, and
in the operation of laying and repairing cables by the steam-ship
“Dacia,” belonging to the Silvertown Company. By its aid ninety-six
soundings, made with Sir William Thomson's steel wire apparatus, in
water averaging 1,500 fathoms depth, were taken in seven days and
nights, bottom in every case being brought up.
    5. Several improvements in Telephones have been brought out,
notably Gower's, in Paris, and Edison's loud-sounding arrangement,
and the instruments       are gradually finding    their way into practical
*Se.
    6. Experiments are being made both       in England and in France in
the transmission of mechanical power         by electric currents; and we
may hope for valuable results from this     field of inquiry.
    The Iron and Steel Institute was          founded in 1869 under the
presidency of the Duke         of Devonshire.     The Society consists of
proprietors and managers       of iron and steel works, of metallurgical
chemists, geologists, and      engineers.   The number of its members
has grown gradually from        140 at its commencement to its present
limit, 1,031, of whom 116 are foreigners residing abroad, and com
prising the leading metallurgists of America as well as of the con
tinent of Europe.      The Association meets twice a year, once (during
the   spring) in  London,  and once (in the autumn) by invitation at one
of the   great  industrial centres in England or abroad. In 1873 it met
at Liège, in 1878 at Paris, and in 1880 it will meet at Düsseldorf.
Each meeting lasts from two to four days, which are spent partly in
reading and discussing papers, and partly in visiting works of
 interest.
    The results of the Association have been of considerable utility: (1)

  takings.
     Telegraph Conference.—When Telegraphy began to assume an inter
  national character, great inconvenience arose from want of uniformity
  in the apparatus used, and in the service regulations adopted by
  different European countries.
     Although the construction of the line (whether submarine, under
  ground, or suspended) and the details of construction of the telegraphic
  apparatus employed may fairly be left in the hands of each country or
 telegraphic administration, it was soon found to be necessary that a
 certain standard of efficiency should be insisted upon.       Agreement
  was moreover requisite in regard to the general character of the in
 struments to be used in international telegraphy; for instance, whether
 or not acoustic signals were to be admissible, whether an indelible
 record should be insisted upon, whether a type-printer, or an auto
 graphic instrument should be used, or a recording instrument repre
 senting the letters by dots and dashes, in which case a uniform code
 would be a matter of necessity. Beside these points there remained
 the subject of the tariff to be charged in each country for transit and
 for terminal messages, involving delicate questions, which could be
 settled only by mutual concessions and general arrangements.
    These considerations led the French Government, in 1866, to invite
 those European Governments who had already taken the administra
 tion of the telegraphs in their own hands, to meet at Paris, in order to
 agree if possible on certain resolutions, subject to ratification by the
 respective Governments.       England was not represented at this first
 Conference, because the telegraphs were not yet a Government
 Department, and it was not thought advisable to invite telegraph
 companies to take part in the proceedings.
    The result of the first deliberations went beyond the mere settlement
 of pressing questions, and it was decided to hold periodical Conferences
 at the different capitals of Europe, and to institute a central Inter
national “Bureau” (to be located at Berne) to see to the .proper
application of the resolutions of the Conferences, and to act as an
International Court of Appeal, regarding questions of difference in
telegraphic matters arising between the contracting countries.
    The second Conference took place at Vienna in 1869, in which
several countries, including Turkey, Persia, and British India, took
part for the first time.      On this occasion it was resolved that the
leading telegraph    companies should be admitted to the discussions,
but should not be allowed to vote; the power of voting being confined

to the Governments, and each country having one vote only, irrespec
tive of its size and importance.
   The third Conference was held at Rome in December, 1871, when
the British Government (Post Office) was for the first time repre
sented, and also the Indo-European and Cable Companies, which
latter are bound by the resolutions of the Conference only in matters
of international administration, and of tariff in cases where lines join
two countries belonging to the Union.
   The fourth Conference met at St. Petersburg in 1876, and the fifth
at London in 1879.    At the latter meeting difficult questions of tariff
arose, which protracted the sittings over nearly two months.          At
previous Conferences it had already been decided to treat each country
as a unit, its particular charge being the same, whether a message
had only to cross the frontier, or had to pass over long distances into
the interior. At the London Conference it was proposed by Germany
to adopt a uniform rate per international message for the whole of
Europe, analogous to the uniform postal rate for letters, while France
went further and urged the adoption of a universal rate per word.
Neither of these measures, however, was adopted, but a compromise
was effected: and after the 1st April, 1880, each word will be charged
at a specified rate for each country, five words being added to each
message to cover time spent in advising, commencing, and finishing                                                 it.
   The next Conference will meet at Berlin in 1884.

  The President then                   proceeded       to the presentation of the Medals:—
   The Copley Medal has been awarded to Rudolph Julius Emmanuel
Clausius, Foreign Member of the Royal Society, for his investigations
in the Mechanical Theory of Heat.
   The Mechanical Theory of Heat as at present understood and taught
has been so essentially a matter of growth, that it would be difficult to
assign to each investigator the precise part which he has taken in its
establishment.    It will, however, be admitted by all, that the re
searches of Clausius rank high among those which have mainly con
tributed to its development. These researches extend over a period
of thirty years, and embrace important applications of the theory not
only to the steam engine, but to the sciences of electricity and
magnetism.
   Even to enumerate those who have contributed to one branch of the
subject, viz., the Kinetic Theory of Gases, would be beyond my pre
sent purpose and powers; but as Clausius himself states, both Daniel
and John Bernoulli” wrote on the subject. And, even, to go back to
earlier times, Lucretiust threw out the idea ; while Gassendi, and our
own Boyle, appear to have entertained         Within our own recollection,
                                                                  it.

     A
     Royal Medal has been awarded to A. C. Ramsay, F.R.S.           Pro
fessor Ramsay has been for a period of nearly forty years connected with
the Geological Survey of Great Britain, and during by far the greater
part of that time either as Director or Director-General of the Survey.
During this long period in addition to his official labours in advancing
our knowledge of the geology of this country, he has published works
on the “ Geology of Arran,” “The Geology of North Wales,” “The
Old Glaciers of North Wales and Switzerland,” and “The Physical
Geology and Geography of Great Britain,” now in its fifth edition.
His papers in the “Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society,” and
elsewhere, are numerous and important, especially those on theoretical
questions in physical geology, such, for instance, as “The Glacial
Origin of Lake Basins,” “The Fresh-water Formation of the Older
Red Rocks,” and “The History of the Valley of the Rhine, and other
Valleys of Erosion.” There are, indeed, among living geologists few
who can claim to have done more to extend our knowledge in the im
portant fields of geology and physical geography.
  A Royal Medal has been awarded to W. H. Perkin, F.R.S. Mr.
William Perkin has been, during more than twenty years, one of
the most industrious and successful investigators of Organic Chemistry.
   Mr. Perkin is the originator of one of the most important branehes
of chemical industry, that of the manufacture of dyes from coal-tar
derivatives.
   Forty-three years ago the production of a violet-blue eolour by
the   addition of chloride of lime to oil obtained from coal-tar was
first noticed, and this having afterwards been ascertained to be due to
the existence of the organic base known as aniline, the production
of the colouration was for many years used as a very delicate test for
that substance.    The violet colour in question, which was soon after
wards also   produced   by other oxidising agents, appeared, however,
to be quite fugitive, and the possibility of fixing and obtaining in a
state of purity the aniline product which gave rise to       it,
                                                             appears not
to have occurred       chemists until Mr. Perkin
                      to                           successfully grappled
with the subject      1856, and produced the beautiful colouring matter
                     in
known      asaniline violet, or mauve, the production      which, on
                                                            of              a
large scale,    by
                 Mr. Perkin, laid the foundation    the coal-tar colour
                                                     of
industry.
     His more recent researches   on   anthracene derivatives, especially on
artificial alizarine, the colouring matter identical with that obtained
from madder, rank among the most important work, and some
                                                                           of of
them have greatly contributed          to
                                      the successful manufacture
alizarine  inthis eountry, whereby we have been rendered independent
of  the importation   of
                       madder.
   Among the very numerous researches        purely scientific interest

 1879.]                     Election of Fellows.                     431
which Mr. Perkin has published, a series on the hydrides of salicyl
and their derivatives, may be specially referred to; but among the
most prominent of his admirable investigations are those resulting
in the synthesis of coumarin, the odoriferous principle of the tonquin
bean and the sweet scented woodruff, and of its homologues.
   The artificial production of glycocol and of tartaric acid by Mr.
Perkin conjointly with Mr. Duppa, afford other admirable examples
of synthetical research, which excited very great interest among
chemists at the time of their publication.
   It is seldom that an investigator of organic chemistry has extended
his researches over so wide a range as is the case with Mr. Perkin,
and his work has always commanded the admiration of chemists for
its accuracy and completeness, and for the originality of its con
ception.
    The Statutes relating to the election of Council and Officers were
 then read, and Prof. François de Chaumont and Dr. Gladstone having
 been, with the consent of the Society, nominated Scrutators, the votes
 of the Fellows present were taken, and the following were declared
 duly elected as Council and Officers for the ensuing year —

   Magnetic Work.—No change has been made in the Magnetographs,
which have worked continuously during the year. The curves ob
tained have been, as a rule, devoid of interest, no disturbance of note
having been registered for some time.
   Owing to wear, the vertical force cylinder bearing has become loose

446                   Report of     the Kew Committee.
  Information on matters relating to terrestrial magnetism and various
data have been supplied to the Hydrographic Office, Dr. E. Van
Ryckevorsel, Dr. Atkinson, Dr. Thorpe, Mr. Elliott, Mr. Fleming, and
Mr. Gordon.                -
   To the last-named gentleman the Committee also lent illustrations
of the magnetographs and other magnetic instruments employed at
Kew for use in a work he has in preparation upon Electricity and
Magnetism.

  Meteorological Work.—The several self-recording instruments for
the continuous registration respectively of atmospheric pressure, tem
perature, humidity, wind (direction and velocity), and rain have been
maintained in regular operation under the care of Mr. T. W. Baker,
assisted by Mr. J. Hillier.
   The standard thermometer (No. 379) for eye observations of the
temperature of evaporation was accidentally broken in September
whilst re-covering the thermograph tube with new muslin. A spare
thermometer (No. 473) of the same construction was at once set up in
its place, so that no loss took place in the registrations.
   The standard eye observations made five times daily, for the control
of the automatic records, have been duly registered through the year,
together with the daily observations at 0h. 45 m. P.M. in connexion
 with the Washington synchronous system.
   An additional daily observation has been made since July 1st at
 6 h. 45 m. P.M., to be used in a second synchronous system organised
 by M. Mascart, Directeur du Bureau Central Météorologique, Paris.
    The tabulation of the meteorological traces has been regularly
 carried on by Mr. Hawkesworth, and copies of these, as well as of the
 eye observations, with notes of weather and cloud, have been trans
 mitted weekly to the Meteorological Office.

  Photo-heliograph.—The re-examination of the measurements of the
Kew sun-pictures, as noticed in the last report, was completed in
January, and the preliminary reductions of                    been steadily       carried

on throughout the year by   Mr. Whipple, assisted by Mr. McLaughlin,
who has been    temporarily engaged for this purpose.    It is expected
that the above reductions will be completed by the end of the present
year, or early in 1880.
  Mr. Marth is still engaged on the reduction to heliocentric elements
of the pictures from January, 1864, to April, 1870, inclusive.
  All these operations have been conducted under the direction and
at the expense of Mr. De La Rue.
   The eye observations of the sun, after the method of Hofrath
Schwabe, as described in the report for 1872, have been made on 151
days, in order to maintain for the present the continuity of the Kew
records of sun-spots. The sun's surface was observed to be free from
spots on 113 of those days.
   Transit Observations.—Seventy-eight observations have been made
of sun-transits for the purpose of obtaining correct local time at the
observatory. Eighty-six clock and chronometer comparisons have also
been made.     This work is performed by Mr. Constable.
   Eactra Observations.—The four solar-radiation thermometers and one
terrestrial-radiation were observed daily until the 3rd of August, when
all, with the exception of one black bulb thermometer, were completely
destroyed by the great hailstorm which occurred on that date.      Since
then only one, the remaining black bulb, and a new terrestrial radia
tion thermometer have been daily observed.
   The Campbell sunshine recorder, described in the Report for 1875,
continues in action, and the improved form of the instrument, giving
a separate record for every day of the duration of sunshine, has been
regularly worked throughout the year, and its curves tabulated.
   Two papers based upon these records have been read by the Super
intendent before the Meteorological Society, and published in their
Quarterly Journal. The first, “On the Relation between the Duration
of Sunshine, the amount of Solar Radiation, and the Temperature
indicated by the Black Bulb Thermometer,” printed in vol.           142,    v.,   p.
shows that these three  phenomena   are intimately connected with each
other, the curves resulting from the plotting down      the daily values
                                                               of
given by the three instruments rising and falling together almost all
through the year.

                                   vol.        v.,

30-3 inches, the variation being most rapid between 29:8 and 30.1
inches. Also that above 30.3 inches cloud increases with increasing
pressure, attaining the mean about 30.5 inches, and rising above it at
30-6 inches.
   Various experiments have been made with the sunshine-recorder
from time to time with the view of improving its efficiency, and new
instruments with certain modifications of the Kew pattern have been
submitted for approval by Messrs. Beck and Mr. Casella.
    Wind Component Integrator.—The numerous adjustments and elec
trical contacts, altogether 190 in number, of this instrument, render
it particularly subject to derangement in this country, the damp
atmosphere causing frequent failures in the electrical actions, and the
high winds constantly shaking the screws loose. The continual neces
sity for readjustment causing a greater demand upon the time of the
Observatory staff than the Committee feel themselves justified in
bestowing upon                it,

  The instrument, when tried       the Observatory      1872, was found
                                                            at                              in

   Pendulum. Observations.—The Committee have had their attention
directed        to   an   ambiguity             ina     paper      by   Messrs.   B.    Stewart and Loewy,

                        Report of  the Kew Committee.                  451
on the corrections to be applied to Pendulum Observations printed in
the “Proc. Roy. Soc.,” vol. xvii, p. 488.
   It is there stated, on p. 489, that the observations were made with a
reversible pendulum, and on p. 497, with Kater's invariable pendulum.
   After a careful investigation the Committee find that only one
pendulum was employed throughout the whole series of experiments,
and that pendulum was Kater's convertible pendulum, designated in
the Royal Society Catalogue of Scientific Apparatus as “the basis of
the present system of British Weights and Measures.”
    The original observations stated in the paper to be preserved at the
Kew Observatory cannot at present be found, and the authors are
unable to afford the Committee any information as to what has become
of them. *
    Verifications.—The    following magnetic instruments have    been veri
fied, and their constants have been     determined:—
         A   Dip-circle, by Barrow     and Co., for the Austro-Hungarian
            Government.
         A Dip-circle,   by J. Dover, for Dr. Guido Schenzl, Budapest.
         A  pair of  Dipping-needles   for Professor Smirnow, Kasan.
    There have also been       purchased   on commission and verified:—
         A Unifilar, Dip-circle, and Fox Circle, together with the
            apparatus for the determination of temperature and          in
            duction co-efficients of Magnets, for Professor Greene, Bureau
            of Navigation, Washington.
         A Unifilar for Professor Houzeau, Brussels Observatory.
         A Unifilar and Dip-circle for Professor Young, Princetown,
            United States.
         A Unifilar for Senhor Capello, Lisbon Observatory.
         A Bifilar for Captain Wille, Norwegian Navy.
         A  Dip-circle for Lieutenant van Hasselt, Utrecht.
          A pair  of Dipping-needles for Professor Ferrari, Rome.
          And a Tabulator for Don Cecilio Pujazon, San Fernando.
    There are at present undergoing verification a Dip-circle for
 Dr. Mielberg of Tiflis, and a Dip-circle for Mr. Casella.
    Although there has been a slight falling off in the total number of
 barometers verified as compared with last year, yet as regards ther
 mometers the result is highly satisfactory, the number of these
 instruments having considerably increased. This is due to the great
 demand for verified clinical thermometers.
    The branch still continues under the charge of Mr. T. W. Baker,
 who is assisted by Messrs. J. Foster, T. Gunter, and C. Taylor. The
 following are the numbers of instruments examined:—

square inch.
   8 Thermometers have been compared at the freezing point of
mercury.
  Duplicate copies of corrections have been supplied in 54 cases.
   12 Standard Thermometers have been calibrated and divided, a set
of three being specially constructed for the experiments on Air Ther
mometers now in progress under Dr. Thorpe at Leeds.
  2 Thermograph Tubes were examined for the Zi-Ka-Wei Obser

26 Barometers, 400 Thermometers, and 4 Rain Gauges.
   The comparison of Messrs. Hottinger's Aneroids being completed,
the Superintendent drew up an account of the instruments and their
performance, which he read before the Meteorological Society.
  The paper was published in the “Quarterly Journal,” vol.                                                          v.,

   Wawed Paper, &c., supplied.—Waxed paper has been supplied     the                               to
following Observatories:—

454                   Report  of the Kew Committee.
   Bombay, Mauritius, Montsouris, San Fernando, and four Observa
tories of the Meteorological Council.
   Anemograph sheets have also been sent to the Mauritius Observatory,
and blank forms for the entry of magnetic observations to the Horton
Observatory, the Bureau of Navigation, Washington, and the Owëns
College.
   Loan Exhibition.—With the exception of the Hodgkinson’s Actino
meter and the three instruments mentioned in last year's report, the
instruments specified in the Report for 1876 still remain in charge of
the Science and Art Department, South Kensington.
   Anemometer Testing.—The Committee have had before them the ques
tion of the desirability of erecting a suitable apparatus for the testing
of Anemometers and Air-meters; but in the opinion of Dr. Robinson
it will be better to postpone its erection for a time.
    Mauritius Observatory.—The Earl of Carnarvon, Secretary of State
for the Colonies, having requested the Committee to nominate a
suitable person to the appointment of First Assistant at the Royal
Alfred Observatory, Mauritius, they eventually selected Mr. Herbert
Irving Bell, Laureate of the Royal College of Mauritius in 1875, from
amongst a number of candidates.
    The Crown Agents having approved of their choice, Mr. Bell went
through a course of training in observatory work, both at the Kew
 Observatory and at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, before he
 sailed for Mauritius on October 6th.
    Workshop. – The   several pieces of Mechanical Apparatus, such as
 the Whitworth Lathe and Planing Machine, procured by Grants
 from either the Government Grant Funds or the Donation Fund for
 the use of the Kew Observatory, have been kept in thorough order,
 and many of them are in constant, and others in occasional, use at the
 Observatory, but the funds of the Committee do not at present allow
 of the employment of a mechanical assistant, although one is much
 needed.
    Library.—During the year the Library has received,    as presents, the
 publications of
       11 English Scientific Societies and Institutions,
       46 Foreign and Colonial Scientific Societies and Institutions.
    A large number of scientific works have also been presented to the
 Library by General Sir E. Sabine, and duplicate copies of works
 already in the Observatory have been presented to
                   Dr. Hinrichs.
                   Professor Karlinski.
                   The Observatory, Pekin.
                   Mr. Rundell.
                   The Society of Telegraph Engineers.

                       Report  of the Kew Committee.                  455
   The Committee have also received back from the Council of the
British Association, a number of works on Meteorology originally pre
sented to the Observatory, but transferred to the Library of the
British Association at Albemarle Street in 1871, when the control
of the Observatory was placed in the hands of the Royal Society.
   It is in contemplation to make a complete catalogue of all the
scientific works in the Library, which now number about 8,000.
   Ventilation Experiments.—The tubes, cowls, and appliances used by
the Sanitary Institute of Great Britain in their experiments on the
ventilating power of cowls of different form, still remain fitted up in
the experimental house, but no use has been made of them for some
months.     As, however, there is no immediate necessity for their re
moval, the Institute has not yet been called upon to dismount them.
   Observatory and Grounds.—The buildings and grounds have been
kept in repair, but owing to the great outlay caused in replacing the
windows     and skylights, which were broken        in the hailstorm of
August 3rd,    1879, Her Majesty's Commissioners    of Woods and Forests
have not    repainted   the Observatory this year, although it is greatly
needed both    internally  and externally.
   The Workshops have been painted externally,     and partially whitened
inside.
   Application was made to the Commissioners to repair the path
across the Park, which had become impassable in the long-continued
wet weather; as however they did not accede to the request of the
Committee, it has been found necessary to adopt temporary measures
for facilitating the approach to the Observatory.
   Staff—The Staff employed at Kew is as follows:–Mr. G. M.
Whipple, B.Sc., Superintendent;        T. W. Baker, First Assistant; J.
Foster, J. W. Hawkesworth,           H. McLaughlin, F. G. Figg, E. G.
Constable, T. Gunter, J. Hillier, C. Taylor, A. Dawson, H. Clements,
and J. Dawson.
   Mr. R. W. F. Harrison resigned his appointment in December, and
two Junior Assistants, C. Taylor and A. Dawson, were then engaged
in his stead.
   Visitors.—The Observatory        has been honoured by the presence,
amongst others,    of:—
        The President, Officers, and Members of the Council of the
           Meteorological Society.

                                            APPENDIX I.
Magnetic  Observations made at the Kew Observatory, Lat. 51°28' 6" N.,
   Long. 0" 1" 15*1 W., for the year October 1878 to September 1879.
   The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed
Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked K C 1, and
the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones.
  The Declination observations have also been made with the same
Magnetometer, Collimator Magnet N E being employed for the purpose.
  The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle No. 33, the needles
1 and 2 only being used; these are 3' inches in length.
  The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the
values of the Horizontal Force, which, being combined with the Dip
observations, furnish the Vertical and Total Forces.
   These are expressed in both English and metrical scales—the unit in
the first being one foot, one second of mean solar time, and one grain;
and in the other one millimetre, one second of time, and one milligramme,
the factor for reducing the English to metric values being 0.46108.
  By request, the corresponding values in C.G.S. measure are also given.
   The value of log              "K
                           employed in the reduction is 1:64365 at tem
perature 60° F.
                           u is 0.000194.
      The induction-coefficient
  The correction of the    magnetic  power for temperature t, to an
adopted standard temperature of 35° F is
             0.0001194(t.—35)+0.000,000,213(t.–35)”.
  The true distances between the centres of the deflecting and deflected
magnets, when the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection
bar marked 1-0 foot and 1.3 feet, are 1:000075 feet and 1:3000.97 feet
respectively.
   The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from the
mean of 12 or 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in
making 100 vibrations,” corrections being applied for the torsion-force
of the suspension-thread subsequently.
   No corrections have been made for rate of chronometer or arc of
vibration, these being always very small.
   The value of the constant P, employed in the formula of reduction
Tn.

              is -0.00179.

      In   each observation         of absolute Declination the instrumental read
ings have been referred to marks made upon the stone obelisk erected
about a quarter of a mile north of the Observatory as a meridian mark,
the orientation of which, with respect to the Magnetometer, was de
termined by the late Mr. Welsh, and has since been carefully verified.
      The observations have               all   been made and reduced
                                                                                     by    Mr.   F.   G.   Figg.

   In order to investigate this subject, devised and constructed the
following apparatus:—A and B are two thin glass basins, 81 millims.
internal diameter (=5,153 sq. millims. of mercury surface), and
6:0 centims. deep; each containing a layer of mercury about 1:0
centim. deep, covered by a layer, about 3 centims. deep, of the
aqueous solution to be examined. C is a thin bent glass tube, about
3 centims. diameter, filled with the liquid, and closed by means of a
bung at D.” E and F are stout glass tubes, about 2 millims. bore,
E having a platinum wire sealed into it at its lower end, and F being
filled with mercury; the ends of these tubes are usually placed in the
mercury previous to adding the liquid; and F is fixed so that the
solution cannot enter           and   it.

sight minutes was usually occupied in raising its temperature the
required number of degrees; the deflections at the various tempera
jures being noted. After an experiment had been made, the mercury
and solution of both vessels were mixed and cooled, and the mercury
iltered, before repeating the trial with the same liquid.
   Care was taken to select solutions which had the least amount of
chemical action upon the mercury; those of salts of the heavy and
less positive metals were therefore not employed.    No liquid was used

    To ascertain whether this order agreed with that of a series arr
 according to the different degrees of electromotive force of the v
 couples,  I simultaneously employed two apparatuses similar t
 already described (but with basins of 75 millims. internal diam
 charging one of them with one solution, and the other with a
 which was next to it in the above series, connecting them wi
 two wires respectively of the differential galvanometer, so that
 currents circulated in opposite directions through the coil of th
 strument, and ascertaining which gave the strongest curre
 160°F. By this means the following series was obtained, in
 the couple giving the strongest positive current is at the top, an
 giving the most powerful negative current at the bottom, as
 previous list. The horizontal line separates those liquids in whi
 hot metal was positive from those in which it was negative.
 relative positions of the solutions in the two series, although
 agree in the main, are not identical; for instance, nitrate of pota
 occupies the eighth place in the first series, and the second pl

the second series; phosphate of ammonium, sulphate of ammonium,
&c., are also changed in position.          Such changes were probably
affected by the  circumstance,   that whilst in the first series the elec
trodes were 81 millims. diameter (=5,153 sq. millims of surface), and
the current from a single apparatus circulated through a continuous
double length of wire in the coil of the galvanometer, in the second series
the electrodes were only 75 millims. diameter (=4,418 sq. millims.),
and the current from a single apparatus circulated through a single
half length of the coil. The temperatures at which the deflections
were noted were also different in the two series. The surface of one

  Remarks.—Many of the remarks which           have made in a I I
paper on the thermo-electric properties of liquids (Proc. Ro
vol. xxvii, pp. 535–538) respecting the cause of the current
to the results obtained in the present research; and       consid                         I
the causes of the currents and of their direction are similar in
Ca,SeS.
   On examining the results it will be observed that the effects
manifestly related to the chemical nature of the solutions; t
liquids in which hot mercury is positive include those of acid,
as those  of alkaline reaction; and similarly with the solutions                                       i
cold  mercury   is positive. To what extent chemical action occu
the experiments and operated as a cause of electric currents
be a difficult point to completely prove, because the amount 1
to produce such feeble currents would be so extremely sm.
result of a general examination of the phenomena, however, c
support the hypothesis that the currents were of chemical origi
  The evident cause of the currents was heat, and the dire
them was probably due to molecular changes in the liquid at
upon alteration of temperature.       In nearly       cases the magnall
the current increased with the amount                     of
                                                 difference     tempe                   of
the apparent,   but not  real, exceptions  were those       which              in                  a   1
or an advance towards it, occurred.

                      Influence of previously heating the Solution.
     Having observed,  even with solutions formed with water which
had been preboiled to expel dissolved air, that unless such liquids had
been further heated to 180° F (and cooled), after the salt, &c., had
dissolved, the currents obtained in successive experiments with such a
solution were not quite uniform in amount, but always decreased,                                           I
examined this circumstance.
     Twenty ounces of distilled water                  was boiled and cooled; the salt to
be employed was then dissolved       completely in     and the solution         it,
shaken with pure mercury. The mixture was then divided into two
equal portions, one    those portions raised
                            of                    temperature   180° to   a                    of         F.

composition; the liquid was then cooled.   These preheated and non
preheated portions were employed respectively   charge the two appa        to
ratuses already described. The two thermo-pairs were then simul

                                 as                 the solution was pre   of
heated with mercury, instead         being preheated alone. The non
                                                 of
preheated portion gave the strongest current; deflection          180°                    1°   at         F.

the lines and the thickness, density, and temperature of the vapours
could be determined.    We had such a determination in view during
our experiments on the reversal of the lines of metallic vapours heated
in iron tubes, and have since made a good many experiments expressly
for the purpose. We have not yet overcome all the difficulties attend
ing these experiments; nevertheless, some results, definite and in
teresting, have been reached, which we now communicate to the
 Society.
   The first experiments were made with wrought iron bottles, of the
form shown in the accompanying figure. To prevent the diffusion of
carbonic oxide from the fire we found     it essential to have the wide
 part, a, and part of the tube, b, coated with borax.     The bottle was
 then  packed in sand in two crucibles, one of them inverted, and heated
 in a small furnace fed with gas retort carbon. The bottle was previ
 ously treated with fused caustic potash at a red heat, and washed with
 acid. Any oxide remaining in the bottle was reduced by a current of
 hydrogen introduced by the side tube e, and forced to pass to the
 bottom by allowing it no exit except by a narrow tube passed through
 the opening c and reaching nearly to the bottom of the bottle, as

shown by the dotted lines. The hydrogen was then repl
nitrogen, the narrow tube removed, c closed by a glass plate
which the spectrum was viewed, and the side tube e connec
thick rubber tube with a glass tube for collecting the gas dr
by the metallic vapour, or with a manometer formed of an
burette dipping into a vessel of water. The sodium, weighe
carbonic acid gas, was introduced in little iron cups about
of gun caps through the oblique side tube d, and the ol
stantly closed with a rubber stopper, for the purpose of m
the gas expelled as the sodium evaporated. This orifice w
with a screw cap, for use when the pressure of the gas in                                           t
was to be varied,             -
   Attempts to measure the temperature of our furnace were
successful.  Observations of temperature depending on the
motive force of a thermo-electric junction of platinum and pa
which had been carefully calibrated in boiling mercury, boil
mium, and boiling zinc, failed at the temperature at which ou
ments were made from the fusion of the palladium.        This i.

pelled from the bottle,   it almost immediately began to be sucked back,
and that nearly, if not quite, as rapidly as it had been expelled, until
not only the whole gas expelled was drawn in again, but generally a
small quantity of nitrogen in addition.       In a few seconds, not only
had the sodium vapour ceased to have any sensible tension, but a
portion of the nitrogen (2 to 3 cub. centims.) had been absorbed.
There was no absorption of nitrogen before the sodium was put in,
and when the equilibrium had been attained, which was always in less
than a minute, there was no absorption afterwards.
   These phenomena seemed to indicate, (1), either that the tempera
ture of the sodium vapour was higher than that of the iron, or that
the emissive power of sodium vapour for light of the wave-length of
D was greater than that of iron at the temperature of the furnace;
 (2), that the width of the bright D line, or band, increased with the
depth of the stratum of sodium when the density was not increased,
inasmuch as the pressure to which the sodium vapour was subject was
always the same, and the only, or the principal, change during the
expansion of the sodium vapour in the bottle was in the thickness of
the layer of vapour; (3), that iron either has the power of forming a
compound with sodium, which is very stable at the temperature of the
furnace, or else it has a power of transmitting sodium vapour analo
gous to that which platinum has in regard to hydrogen.          This last
supposition seems to be negatived by the fact that we found that out
of 220 grn. of sodium put into the bottle in a series of experiments
on one occasion, 198 grim. was afterwards extracted when the bottle
was cold by washing it out with hydrochloric acid.        The effect was
not due to the nitrogen, since the sodium appeared to be taken up in
the same way when carbonic oxide was substituted for nitrogen.
   This behaviour of iron towards sodium explains a phenomenon
which had puzzled us when operating before with iron tubes, viz.,
that it required a very large quantity of sodium, many times the
normal amount, to fill one of the tubes with sodium vapour.        It also
seems to explain the fact observed by Mr. Lockyer (Proc. Roy. Soc.,
vol. xxii, p. 371), that sodium heated in a long iron tube gives the
D absorption line “no thicker than when seen under similar con
ditions in a test tube.”
   We    came, of course, to the conclusion that it was useless to pursue
the   investigation of the quantitative measure of sodium vapour by
experiments in iron vessels; and we had a stout platinum tube made,
 half an inch in diameter and 23 inches long, connected by a union
joint with an iron tube with fittings similar to those of the top of the
iron bottles before described; and also a bottle similar to the iron
 bottles, but entirely of platinum.     When used, the tube was packed
 with magnesia inside a wider porcelain tube, and the bottle was
 packed with lime in blacklead crucibles.

   For convenience in introducing the sodium,      a fine  platinum tube,
about 1 millim. in diameter, was filled with sodium by sucking up the
melted metal, and different lengths of this tube were cut off as required,
wrapped at once in thin platinum foil, and dropped into the heated
vessel.   Amalgams containing various percentages of sodium were
also employed.     In the case of amalgams containing 1 per cent. and
upwards the pieces were weighed; those containing less than 1 per
cent. were measured by a very fine pipette.    In all cases the amalgam
was introduced into the hot vessel wrapped in platinum foil.
   For varying the pressure within the vessels, and so by compression
or expansion varying the density and thickness of the stratum of
metallic vapour under observation, an ordinary compressing and
exhausting syringe, connected with a gauge, was used.            With the
bottle we could not venture to reduce the    pressure   below that of the
atmosphere, lest the softened platinum should collapse; but in the
case of the tube the pressure could be reduced to one-fourth of an
atmosphere. Into both vessels we have pumped nitrogen until the
pressure reached three atmospheres.
    Whenever it was desired to empty the vessel of sodium, in order to
begin a fresh series of experiments without the necessity of cooling the
vessel, the sodium (or sodium and mercury) vapours were blown out
by a current of hydrogen passed down to the bottom of the vessel in
the mode already described, and when the metallic vapours were suffi
ciently expelled, the hydrogen was replaced by nitrogen.           In this
way, though the last traces of sodium were never expelled, the D
absorption could be reduced to two narrow lines.
    On introducing a fragment of sodium into the hot vessel, when
free, or nearly so, from sodium to begin with, the bright yellow band
rapidly expanding and becoming fainter and more diffuse, and finally
dying away, was seen as in the iron bottles; but instead of the D
absorption remaining narrow as it had been before, it began to in
crease in witlth as the bright band died away, and soon attained
a maximum width, and remained steadily at that width—a width
several times that of the distance between the D lines, but much less
 than that of the bright band at its widest. A second piece of sodium
thrown in produced a repetition of the same phenomena, except that
the bright band was obscured by the absorption of the layer of
sodium vapour first introduced, and only seen when it expanded beyond
the absorption band. More pieces of sodium produced like effects; the
 absorption band gradually widening as more sodium was put in, until
 the channelled spectrum began to appear.
    The effects of compressing the vapour were very remarkable.          As
 the pressure increased the channelled spectrum speedily disappeared,
 then the diffuse edges of the D band contracted, the band itself
 likewise   contracting  until it  became    a  very   fine pair of   lines,

or if the amount of sodium present was not too much, D came
out bright.    On letting off the pressure, the phenomena recurred
in the reverse order, and the whole could be repeated severai
times. After compression as long as the pressure was sustained the D      .
absorption remained permanently narrowed, but did not continue
bright.   When there was only a very little sodium in the platinum
tube and the pressure diminished, the D band was seen to expand and
become diffuse, contracting again as the pressure was restored, but
not generally contracting to quite its former width or sharpness.
   We used sometimes amalgams of sodium in order to have a very
dense gas to retard diffusion, and for the purpose of getting various
quantities of sodium diffused through equal spaces.           With these
amalgams the general course of the phenomena was much the same as
 with the metal alone, except that we could not by compression to
three atmospheres make the D lines show out so bright as with
sodium alone, although     the absorption    was   reduced  to extremely
narrow dimensions.
   One set of experiments was made with a series of amalgams con
taining decreasing percentages, all less than 1 per cent., of sodium,
equal quantities of each were put into the hot tube in succession, the
vapour of each being blown out before the next was put in. The
thickness of the layers observed was thus very nearly constant, but the
density of the sodium vapour variable. It was calculated that the
 mercury vapour would, at the temperature of the tube, fill a height
 of about 20 centims.        The D absorption was very broad, with
wide diffuse   edges,  with an amalgam of # per cent, and did not
sensibly diminish in width until the percentage of sodium was re
duced to #.
   The results of the foregoing experiments may have been complicated
by the sodium vapour which diffused into the cool part of the vessel.
We have attempted to overcome this complication by passing down
into the bottle, when full, or nearly full, of sodium vapour, a platinum
tube closed at the top with a glass plate, and filled with nitrogen, and
observing the absorption through this tube.      The nitrogen in the tube
prevents for a short time the entry of the sodium vapour into the
tube, and so by passing the tube to different depths, the thickness of
the layer of sodium through which the observations were made could
be varied.    It was found in this way that a layer of sodium vapour,
about 4 centims. thick at the atmospheric pressure at the tem
perature of our furnace, gave the D absorption sharp and very narrow,
but as the sodium diffused into the tube the absorption extended until
it produced a broad band with diffuse edges. Without a long process
of washing, it is impossible to clear the tube of sodium, so that the
repetition of observations in this way is a very tedious business.    We
are looking for some transparent substance which will stand the high

why the bright band should appear while the sodium is evaporating,
when a depression of temperature should ensue.           The depression of
temperature    will, however, affect the hot bottom of the vessel, and so
it and the lowest layer of sodium vapour may be relatively cooler than
the layers above. Professor Stokes has suggested another cause which
may intensify the effect, depending on the fact that the radiation from
the sides of the vessel is partly reflective, partly emissive, while that
from the sodium is almost wholly emissive. The bottom of the vessel
will be somewhat diminished in brightness by the opening opposite

   In our former communication “On the Vapour Densities of Potas
sium and Sodium,” we pointed out the chief obstacles which lay in the
way of an exact determination of these constants. Having overcome
the chief manipulative difficulties in connexion with the method we
described, there still remained the problem for solution as to how far
the use of iron bottles in our experiments might affect the results.

  The new determinations of the molecular weights of potassium and
sodium are just about half the former values, and would seem to
support the inference that the atom of each of these metals resembles
mercury and cadmium in the gaseous state, as regards molecular
volume.   Such a remarkable result cannot be accepted without a very
thorough  investigation of the secondary reactions which may be in
duced at high temperatures. It is certain that in the platinum vessels
there is much less absorption of vapour than in the case of iron, and
that the action of the furnace gases is      but eliminated.                      all                                      The
following suggestions might   made     explain the results.
                                                  be                the to                                            In
first place, the metals   may  contain    large  amount       occluded  a                                of
hydrogen.    With reference     this assumption, we have examined
                                              to
the sodium used      our experiments and find,
                             in                    careful exhaustion                   on
and boiling      Sprengel vacuum, that one volume
                  in   a                                  sodium only                              of
contains one-third      its volume of   occluded  hydrogen,     of that                                               so
this will not account “for the double volume of the atom of the
metals.”   The alkali metals may form volatile compounds with
platinum, although, judging from analogy, such compounds are
not likely   to
             exist.   so, the vapour blown out
                                   If           the bottle ought                         of
to  contain platinum.    The use      platinum tubes      of
                                                          blow out the                        to
vapours prevented the test being applied.         The metals may
changed into oxides from occluded oxygen                                                                                     no be
                                               the platinum.      so,         in                                If
free metal ought    remain to the bottle after this rapid evaporation.

Heppel found it convenient for his special case to make the summations
twice for the same span, working forwards and backwards from every
point of support, but in the following the summations are all effected
working in the same direction, only one summation being necessary
for each span.
    3. Suppose OQ to be one span of a continuous beam which has
loads and supporting forces beyond 0 and Q. To find the bending
moment at a point P, it is sufficient to know what is the bending
moment at O, and the shearing force at a very short distance inside
 O.   If we suppose the bending moment to be called positive when it
tends to make the beam convex upwards, and the shearing force at a
section positive when it tends to elevate the part of the beam to the
right of the section, then M, the bending moment at a point P, is
equal to
                               Mo–Sox OP+m,
where Mo and So are the bending moment and shear at 0, and where
m is the sum of all such expressions as–an element of load at any
place P, between 0 and P, multiplied by P'P.
    Again, if M is the bending moment at a section, E the modulus of
elasticity, I  the moment of inertia of the section about its neutral
line, y the vertical displacement of a point in the neutral axis of the
beam from its horizontal position, a the horizontal distance of this
point from    some fixed point in the neutral axis as 0, then               for all
beams and girders used by engineers--
                                 d'u-   M.

The only restriction that we shall use is to suppose all points of sup
port in the same straight line. But as is well known, if this case
is solved, the unrestricted case may also be solved, and the case in
which there is a yielding in the supports.
    Let Mo Mi be the bending moments at the points of support O and
 Q.    Let So be the shearing force just inside O. When we know the
nature of the loading—
                   Mo                       P              M,

 we can find    m the moment at     P   due to the load between         O and P.
 Thus if w be the load per unit length at any place, and            if   we know
 how w alters, we can find the sum—

  It is very easy to write out the values of these summations in
certain simple cases, and the calculation in the most general cases
can always be made with a very fair approximation to accuracy, and
with not much risk of mistakes being made, by the graphic methods
described below.                                      -
The bending moment at any point               P is—

but at Q we have                         a   =ll,
and                                      M=M1,

   Substituting this value for M in the differential equation (1), and
integrating once, remembering that when v equals nought, d, f, and g
vanish, we see that if ao is the inclination (very small) of the beam
downwards from the horizontal at 0, and if a is the inclination of the
beam at any point P, then

As  a familiar example, we may consider a beam OQ, of wh
ends are fixed horizontally and at the same level, here
                                                   20=0,
and                                                21=0.
     We can prove that, when we know the angle of thebeam at
ofa span, and the bending moment at the other end, we have s
data for calculation, having the above summations m, &c. This

           Graphic Determination of the Summations of paragraph 3.
    5.  It has hitherto been usual    for engineers to  assume that the load
 and section are uniform in each        span, because,  as we have seen, the
 calculations in this case are       easy,  whereas those necessary when
 attempting the general solution are exceedingly complicated; in fact,
 an examination of Mr. Heppel's solution of a comparatively simple
 case is sufficient to deter engineers from such calculations.          But by
 the following graphic method the solution of the most general case
 only requires a very elementary mathematical knowledge, and may be
 completed in a few hours, or in a much shorter time if a Thomson’s
 integrating machine, or even a good planimeter be available.
    We employ a link polygon method for the calculation of m, and it
 may be expedient to draw the deflected beam by Mohr’s method. To
 employ, however, a link polygon method throughout the whole of the
 investigation would lead to much waste of time, however interesting it
 might be from a mathematical point of view; and as in many other
 engineering problems, for instance, the finding of centres of gravity
 and moments of inertia, so in this we see that the use of a little arith
 metic, and the actual measurement of lines gives quicker and more
 accurate integrations.
    Our students in Japan made the necessary summations for spans of
 300 and 200 feet respectively.     Their drawings were exhibited at the
 meeting, and one of them is shown on a reduced scale in fig. 6.           It is
 advisable to use some well-known scale for the measurement of the
 lines;   for example, a scale of centimetres. The distance AIB, fig. 6,
 represents the span of 200 feet to the scale—one centimetre stands for
 3' feet. The ordinate of the diagram AEEE, &c., shows the value
         at every point of the span, and in all cases, except where there
 of #.
is a sudden    change of inclination   of the beam over a    pier (see the end
 of § 3), any unit of measurement whatever may         be employed    for E.

   The value of d at any point P is shown by the ordinate PP' to the
curve AP'B', and BB' equals di, the curve AP'B' being obtained by
raising ata number of points, such as P, the ordinate PP", measured
to any  convenient scale, and representing the area AEEP.      It is
evident that n1 is the total area of the figure AP'B'B, the scale of
measurement being computed in the manner described below.

TT"; make T3 equal to B.E., T2 equal to the ordinate at E, and T1
equal to the ordinate at E. Join A with the points, 1, 2, 3, &c., and
produce if necessary. Now it is quite evident that any ordinate of the
figure AA1A2A3A1B"B                    represents                  to a known      scale;   thus, for

  10. As an example we may take the following, worked out by
Messrs. Terauchi and Saiki, two of our students:—
  Design a lattice-girder-bridge with two main girders, the girders
being of a constant depth; to carry a double line of railway, and to
consist of three spans, respectively 200, 300, and 200 feet long.
  Consulting Baker, they assumed the total weight of cross-beams,
permanent way, &c., to equal 0:55 ton per foot of the middle span,
and 0.5 ton per foot in the end spans: the weight of main girders to
be 1:35 and 0.7 ton per foot in the middle and end spans respectively,
and the rolling load 2 tons per foot.
  First Calculations.—Assume that the girders have everywhere the
same cross-section, then we have merely to employ the following
equation, $4, for any two consecutive spans:—
                     Moli +2M1(li +        l2)
                                                 +M.–'-'=0.
     1.   As   regards the Weight     of   the Bridge itself.
                         wi=1:2,            w2=1:9,             ws=1:2.
We find                         M1=M2=11711.5          ton feet,
                                          Mo=M3–0.
At   any point      in   the first span
                                   M=0.63:2–614425¢.
At any point        in   the second span
                                M=11711.5–0.954:2–285.c.
The curve OAA'A"A" (fig.   has been plotted
                                       5)        show this diagram to
ofbending moments for half the bridge, the other half being exactly
similar.       O   and   Q   are two supports, and     H   is   the middle   of   the bridge.
   2.     The Rolling Load covering the whole Bridge.
   We find that                  M1=M2=25173 ton feet,
                                        Mo=M3–0.

and the diagram for half the bridge is    OCC'C"C".
    4. The Rolling Load covering the ends Spans only.
    We find that           M1=Ms=14788 ton feet,
                                  Mo=M3=0.
At any point in the first span
                              M=1:6a 3–246.062.
 At any point in the    second span
                           M=14788–0954–285.
 and the diagram for half the bridge is shown in ODDD"D".
    5. OFF"F"F" is the diagram for half the bridge when only the
 first span is covered with the rolling load.
     6. OGG'G"G” is the diagram for half the bridge when only the
 first two spans are covered with the rolling load.
     As the depth is supposed to be constant, the moment of inertia of
 each section is now supposed to be nearly proportional to the greatest
 bending moment which is ever found at that section during any of the
 above distributions of load, and the ordinates of the diagram AEE,
 &c., show the values which have been assumed for the moment of
 inertia of each section, these values being either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  If the girders had not been of constant depth, so that the moment of
 inertia might have been changed by altering the height of the girder,
 as well as the areas of the booms, we should have proceeded in a
 slightly different way to get the diagram of I. As it was, our students

 1879.]      On Most General Problems in Continuous           Beams.      505
 found it advisable to use six thicknesses of plates in the booms at the
 middle of the centre span, and they therefore made        I there equal to 6.
    It is  unnecessary  to enter    fully into the details of the complete
 drawings exhibited.     On each curve was written the scale to which it
 was drawn.      Employing the methods previously described, a few
 hours will be sufficient for making all the necessary calculations.

   Just in the  same way the necessary summations may be made              for
the  most general cases, the moment of inertia and the load varying         in
any way whatever from point to point in a span.

     OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
   THE REv. DR. PEYTON BLAKISTON was the youngest son of Sir Mathew
Blakiston, Bart., of Sandybrooke Hall, Derbyshire.      He was born in
1801, and was educated first at Eton, afterwards at Trinity College,
Cambridge.     From thence he migrated to Emmanuel College, where
he was elected to one of the Dixie Fellowships.     Having taken holy
orders he became vicar of Lymington, and held that preferment for
several years.    His health, however, broke down, and symptoms of
pulmonary disease having manifested themselves, he resorted to Paris,
and placed himself under the care of the celebrated Louis, who told
him that he could not expect ever to be able to discharge the duties
of a public preacher.    With a decision that was characteristic of him,
he at once resolved to abandon the clerical profession and adopt that
of medicine. For this he had always manifested a predilection, having
whilst at Lymington established and devoted himself to the support of
a provident dispensary.
   He resigned his living, and with a wife and children returned to
Cambridge, and subsequently to Paris, and devoted himself with
great energy and determination to medical studies. As soon as he
obtained his diploma of M.B. at Cambridge, he established himself
at Birmingham, where he speedily acquired the confidence of the
public and great popularity with his professional brethren. As a
member of the Philosophical Institution of Birmingham, he delivered
lectures on chemistry and physical science, and did good service to
his profession by the application of his scientific knowledge to the
elucidation of the laws of sound and the use of the stethoscope, which
was then obtaining the general notice of the profession. In 1841
he took his degree of M.D. at Cambridge, and became physician to
the Birmingham General Hospital.         At Birmingham he published
a Treatise on the Influenza of     1837,  and a volume of “Practical
Observations on Certain Diseases of the Chest and on the Principles
of Auscultation.”     This volume he dedicated to his old master, Louis,
and his friends and former pupils, the late Dr. W. Allen Miller and
William Bowman.         This volume was a valuable contribution to
medical science and practice, and displayed not only a well trained
philosophical mind, but also an acute careful clinical observer. In
1843 Dr. Blakiston became         a Fellow of the Royal College of
Physicians, and in the same year was elected a Fellow of the Royal
   WOL. XXIX.                                                  b

Society.    In 1848 the state of his health compelled him to seek a
more genial climate than that of Birmingham, and he removed to
St. Leonards-on-Sea, where he enjoyed a large and lucrative practice
till 1871, when he retired from professional labours. During his
residence at St. Leonards, he published a volume entitled “Clinical
Observations on Diseases of the Heart and Thoracic Aorta,” and
which comprised the results of his experience in a practice of more
than thirty years. After retiring from practice, and while resid
ing in London, he published a volume of lectures on “Modern
Society in its Religious and Social Aspects,” and a little work en
titled “Clinical Reminiscences.”          Throughout his whole career
Dr. Blakiston manifested great independence of character, a high
sense of the duties and responsibilities of both professions of which he
was a member, and great activity and energy in advancing their best
interests. As a physician he showed much skill in the application of
his acquirements as a physicist to the diagnosis of disease and evidence
of carefully trained power of observation.          Never seeking to win
popular favour or applause for himself, he was remarkable for the
interest that he manifested and the pains he took to promote the
advancement of those young men of ability and promise with whom
he was brought into contact.          He possessed considerable general
culture and artistic tastes, and his writings are scholarly, clear, and
refined in style and imbued with an elevated tone.              With great
kindness of heart and   general  geniality  of manner,  in conversation he
displayed a keen sense of humour; and, with much wit, often a degree
of abruptness and sharpness of retort, sometimes a little too much for
sensitive people. During the last years of his residence in London,
the state of his health precluded his going much into society or taking
any active share in public matters, but he felt and manifested to the
last a vivid interest in all the religious, social, and scientific topics of
 the day. He died suddenly on the 17th December, 1878, at the age
 of 77.
    WILLIAM FROUDE was born in 1810, and was the son of the Venerable
 R. H. Froude, Archdeacon of Totnes.           He was educated at West
 minster and Oriel College, Oxford, where he obtained a First Class in
 the Mathematical Class List of 1832.       Froude adopted the profession
 of a civil engineer, and became a pupil of Mr. H. R. Palmer, and in
 1838 an assistant of Mr. Brunel, under whom he was engaged on the
 works of the Bristol and Exeter Railway, and on other work. For
 family reasons he retired from active professional work in 1846, and
 from that year until 1870 he occupied himself in various scientific
 investigations at his own expense.
    Among these may be especially noted the following:—The law which
  governs the “Discharge      of Elastic Fluids under Pressure through

                                         iii
   Short Tubes or Orifices,” on which a paper by Froude was read at the
  Institution of Civil Engineers, June 15th, 1847.           Herein attention
  was called to the misconception on which was based a then generally
  received theory of the flow of gases.         This received theory treated
  elastic fluids as though they were under virtually the same conditions
  as inelastic fluids.   Froude tested by the best means in his power the
  result of his more correct views by experiment on the flow of air into
  a more or less complete vacuum.
      Another subject of inquiry in which he put his views on paper
   (though he did not publish them) was the resistance experienced by a
  plane moving obliquely through a fluid.        Here, as in the previous case,
  Froude detected and expounded quantitatively the want of correctness
  of the existing theory, and suggested an improved and much more
  correct interpretation of the experimental data. The correct theory
  on the subject is scarcely yet determined, though it is in course of
  determination by that doctrine of stream lines by the appreciation of
  which Froude worked so usefully.
       The important bearing of the resistance experienced by an oblique
  plane upon the consideration of the flight of birds was a constant
  subject of thought to Froude.         He studied the attitudes adopted by
  birds, especially sea fowl, in soaring, and made many measurements
  and quantitative calculations on the subject, but never felt satisfied
  that there might not be cases not to be accounted for by his inter
  pretations.                                        -
      On his   voyage   out to the   Cape    in 1878–9,  and at the Cape he
  pursued his observations, and he wrote long letters on the subject to
  friends in England.       One of his last acts before he was laid up in his
  short final illness  was,  though suffering from feverish cold, to measure
  accurately two albatross obtained for the purpose.
      We will now give an outline of the investigations into the rolling
  and form of ships, by which Froude obtained a high position among
  men of science. At the request of his friend Mr. Brunel, his attention
  had been given to the problems connected with the rolling of ships
  during the construction of the “Great Eastern” ship, and in 1861
  he placed before the Institute of Naval Architects a paper embodying
...the elementary principles by which the rolling of ships is governed.
     In this paper he dealt especially with the leading phenomena of
  cumulative rolling, and in successive papers at the same Institution,
  and in Naval Science, he considered the modifying influence of the
 frictional and other resistances.         He also dealt with the cases of
 abnormal forms of ships.
     As a preliminary to the discussion of the subject of the rolling of
 ships, Froude had put into mechanical language the essential features
 of the trochoidal sea wave. He, from the first, verified the principle
 of the subject by experiments with variously formed models.
     -                                                                    The
                                                                 b 2

                                     iv.
consideration of the great advantages of introducing resist
check to rolling, led him to urge the adoption of bilge ke
enlarged scale. The advantage of such large bilge keels was
noticeable in the behaviour at sea of the Indian troop ships.
   Contemporaneously with his investigations on rolling, Fr.
been pursuing the subject of the resistance of ships, and b
ments in models tried first on a small scale and subsequel
models 6 feet and 12 feet long, had satisfied himself of the co
of a definite law which he propounded for the relation bet
resistance of a vessel and that of her model, and his law w
that the resistance varied as the cube of the linear dimension
proportional to the square root of the linear dimension.      Ac
had to be applied to allow for the increased ardency of surfac
on a short surface like a model as compared with that on
larger surface of a ship.
   Froude, convinced of the value of model experiments as a
of the resistance of ships, at the desire of Mr. E. J. Reed,
examined the experiments, and their results, made a propo
Admiralty to conduct a series of experiments on models
The proposal was accepted, and in the year 1870 the exp
establishment near Froude's house at Chelston Cross, Torq
constructed. The main features of this are a covered waterw
which models made of hard paraffin are drawn by steam
regulated speed and their resistance automatically recorded
are machines for shaping the models and appliances for te
effect of model screw propellers and for making other observa
   At this time, also, the loss of Her Majesty's ship “Captai
the appointment of the Committee on Designs of Ships of
which Froude was a member.
   As a work undertaken for this Committee, he tried a vari
periments with models of Her Majesty's ship “Devasta
exemplify the probable effects of bilge keels in the rolling of
 and shortly afterwards, at the request of the Admiralty, he d
by still water rolling experiments with several of Her Majes
 the resistance which the forms of their hulls offered to rollin
 might   be inferred their probable behaviour at sea.
    Proceeding a step further, Froude devised automatic
 apparatus for continuously registering the rolling movements
 at sea, both in relation to the vertical and in relation to a lir
 dicular to the mean wave surface on which the ship at eac.
 was placed.     From the record given by this instrument th
 the waves in which the ship had been resting could be ded
 accuracy.
    Following up these experiments on rolling, Froude
 experiments at sea in Her Majesty's ship “Greyhound,”

                                     V
 sequently went on the experimental cruizes of Her Majesty's ship
 “Devastation,” when valuable observations were made on her rolling
 and general behaviour at sea.
   His services as a member of the “Inflexible” Committee in 1877,
 were the latest practical application of his studies of the rolling
 question.
   Another outcome of the Committee on Designs was an important
 experiment on the resistance of a full sized ship which was conducted
 under Froude's superintendence.               -
   The  “Greyhound,”    a corvette, was towed at various speeds, and her
resistance measured     by  a  special dynamometer.      The result was
valuable as verifying the result of the experiments with models, and
it was also valuable as calling attention to the great difference be
tween the power delivered in a ship's engines, and the power usefully
 employed in propelling the ship.
   The causes of this difference, especially that of the detrimental
action of the screw propeller, when placed immediately behind the
ship, was a matter to which Froude paid great attention, and the
several ways in which the engine power is used or wasted, was the
subject of one of his later papers read before the Institute of Naval
Architects.
   At the establishment at Torquay there have been in progress a
series of experiments in the forms of ships from which valuable
general results have already been obtained, and for the Royal Navy all
the proportions and forms have been subjected to the investigation
given by Froude's experimental apparatus at Torquay.
   In 1875, as President of the Mechanical Section of the British
Association, Froude, in his address explained in an intelligible form
the bearing of the stream line theory on the question of the resistance
of ships. This address he afterwards delivered as a lecture at the
Royal Institution.
   It has been said above that propulsion was a subject carefully con
sidered by Froude.     In connexion therewith, he was requested by the
Admiralty to design a dynamometer, capable of testing the power
delivered by large marine engines. The novel and ingenious instru
ments he thought out to meet the extreme conditions of transferring
to a resisting lever the rotative force of 2,000 or 3,000 horse-power
was described by him at the meeting of the Institution of Mechanical
Engineers, at Bristol, in 1877.
   He also had occasion to investigate the elementary principles de
termining the proportion of screw propellers; and his paper on this
subject, read at the meeting of the Institute of Naval Architects in
1878, was the last of his published contributions to science.
   Froude's investigations had been recognised by his election, in 1870,
as a Fellow of the Royal Society, and by his receiving in 1876 the

                                    vi
Royal Medal from the Royal Society, and the honorary degree of LL.D.
from the University of Glasgow.        Although his health had suffered
from domestic sorrows, it might have been expected that more years
of work were in store for him, to be rewarded by new discoveries in
his favourite studies. Yet these hopes were destined to be summarily
disappointed.    He went, in the winter of 1878, on a pleasure cruize in
Her Majesty's ship “Boadicea,” and while at the Cape was attacked
by dysentery, and died, after a short illness, on May 4th, 1879.
Froude's character was one in which a rare degree of modesty and
disregard of self was combined with a singular charm of voice and
manner. This enabled him so to act in many difficult positions that
he secured for himself a prompt recognition of the great scientific
knowledge and powers of mind with which he was endowed. Those
who would desire to learn something of his character and work, as
depicted by himself, would do well to read the evidence given by him
before the Royal Commission on Scientific Research, on May 29th,
 1872.
   BARON JOHN BENJAMIN HEATH, Grand Officer        of the Order of the
Crown of    Italy, Knight   Commander of the Italian Order of Saints
Maurice and Lazarus, Knight Commander of the Russian Order of
 St. Anne, Consul-General for the Kingdom of Italy, was born at
Genoa on the 6th June, 1790; his father, Mr. John Heath, having
been many years established as an English merchant in that Re
public.    A few months after his return to England, in 1798, Mr.
 John Heath sent his son, then only eight years of age, to school
 at Harrow, under the care of Dr. Drury, then head master of that
 school, whose wife was sister to Mr. John Heath.       He passed about
 eight years at Harrow, where he was for some time fag to Lord Byron.
 On leaving Harrow he was sent to Hall Place School, near Foots
 Cray, in Kent, to learn arithmetic, English grammar, and other matters
 which at that time were much neglected at our great public schools.
He married, in 1811, Sophia, daughter of Robert Bland, M.D., of
 London, by whom he had a numerous family, of whom seven, i.e.,
 four sons and three daughters, survive him.
    In November, 1816, he was appointed Consul-General for the
 Kingdom of Sardinia, and in 1861 became Consul-General for the
 Kingdom of United Italy; so that at the time of his death, in January
last, he had held his Consular Commission rather more than sixty-two
years. After fifty years of Consular service he was created a Baron of
the Kingdom of Italy by King Victor Emmanuel II, -and the title was
made hereditary through the male branch.                     -
    Baron Heath continued the business of his     father, as a merchant
and foreign banker, in London, and was still at the head of the house
 of Heath and Co. at the time of his death. He was for fifty years a

                                   Vii
director of the Bank of England, and was Deputy Governor of the
Bank, with Mr. William Cotton as Treasurer, in 1844, when Sir
Robert Peel passed the new Bank Act; the two Governors of the
Bank materially assisted Sir Robert in preparing the details of that
most useful measure.
   Baron Heath     was for many years a member of the Court of
Assistants of the Grocers' Company, whereof he was Master in
1829, when he presented the Company with his unpublished book,
called “Some account of the Grocers' Company,” which is a history of
the Company from its institution more than five hundred years ago.
As a testimony of their appreciation of this work, the Court presented
him with a splendid piece of silver plate.
   Baron Heath was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1843;
he was an accomplished musician and a good linguist, and took
much interest in literary and archaeological pursuits, in following up
which, he became a member of several learned societies; he was also a
member of the Roxburghe Club, of the Philobiblon Society, and the
Dilettante Society; he possessed a well-selected library and a large
collection of autographs, in which he took great pleasure.
   Baron Heath died on Thursday, the 16th January last, after a few
days illness.
   PROFESSOR KELLAND was the son of the Rev. Philip Kelland, who at
the time of the birth of his son was rector of the parish of Dunster,
in Somersetshire. Afterwards it would appear that he removed to
Landcross, in Devonshire.     Though an Oxford man himself, his father
sent his son Philip to Queen's College, Cambridge, where he greatly
distinguished himself among his contemporaries, and in 1834 stood
at the head of the honour list as Senior Wrangler and Smith Prize
man. Among those whose names appear on the same list were the
Rev. Dr. John William Donaldson, the author of the New Cratylus,
and editor of “Pindar;” and Mr. Main, who became first assistant in
the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, and subsequently Director of the
Radcliffe Observatory, Oxford.        The latter subsequently married
Mr. Kelland's   sister, and between the two old college friends there
existed the closest   intimacy  until Mr. Main’s death. Mr. Kelland,
who had taken orders in the Church of England, became a tutor in
Queen's College, and continued such for the next three years. It was
in 1838 that he was appointed to the Chair of Mathematics in the
Edinburgh University, as successor to Professor Wallace.       For the
chair there were a number of candidates, including Mr. Gregory, the
author of “Gregory's Examples,” and Mr. Edward Sang, and a warm
controversy seems to have been carried on as to the respective merits
of the rival candidates. Against Mr. Kelland, Sir William Hamilton,
then the occupant of the Logic Chair, was in arms, and in June, 1838,

                                       viii
 the great metaphysician and philosopher wrote a pamphlet addressed
 to the Lord Provost and Town Council, in whose hands was the
 patronage of the chair, “on the election of a Professor of Mathe
 matics,” in which he spoke very strongly in favour of the qualifications
 of Mr. Gregory as against those of Mr. Kelland.        Once in the Senatus,
 however, Mr. Kelland's gentlemanly manner, not less than his eminent
 ability as a teacher, soon converted former opponents into friends.
 That he bore no malice—as indeed his nature was incapable of doing
so—to those who had opposed him is shown from the way in which
he speaks of Sir William Hamilton, in connexion with later fights,
both in the Senatus and between that body and the Town Council.
“I   can say” (he remarks), “who was witness and part-actor in all these
contests, that never did Sir William exhibit a shadow of self-seeking.
Not for his comfort or his gain he contended; and although my own
department was the object of some of his best known attacks,           I  can
say that never for one moment did        I  feel towards him other than the
warmest personal regard—nay, more, attachment.               He was indeed
one of    my   kindest, steadiest friends.”        On the retirement of Sir
William Hamilton as secretary of the Senatus, another controversy
arose. The Town Council proposed that the office should be merged in
that of a general secretary to the University; but the Senatus carried
the day, and appointed Mr. Kelland their secretary—a position he filled
in a highly satisfactory manner until 1867. Official duty as well as
inclination, therefore, led him to take an active part in the movement
then going on in favour of University reform, which resulted in the
appointment of the Commission of 1858, and the ultimate release of
the University from what the Professor described as the “somewhat
imaginary despotism of the Town Council.” When Professor James
D. Forbes, who occupied the Natural Philosophy Chair, was laid aside
from work through ill-health, Mr. Kelland came forward, and, with
the assistance of one of his students, discharged the duties of the
chair from 1852 until 1856.       As a teacher he was exceedingly popular
with his  students,  and that the Mathematical class did not fall off in
his hands   he proved with justifiable pride in the speech already referred
to, by an allusion to the fact that whereas in 1838 he enrolled 111
students, in the past year he enrolled 373.
   The year after he came to Edinburgh, Professor Kelland was elected
a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, in whose welfare he ever
took the greatest interest, and to whose publications he largely con
tributed.    He  became  in time   one  of the vice-presidents, and last year
he was chosen to succeed      Sir William Thomson in the presidential
chair, and opened the session in November last with the customary
inaugural address. The deceased Professor was also, for about ten
years from 1850, an active member of the Society of Arts, and he was
president of that Society also in the session 1853–4. An institution

                                     ix
in which Professor Kelland took much interest was the Life Asso
ciation of Scotland, of which he was one of the original founders.
 In connexion with the business of that institution he was induced
in 1858 to take a trip to America, and while there he improved
the occasion by making himself better acquainted with Transatlantic
science and the state of education in the primary and secondary schools
of the United States. A few of the results of his observations he gave
to his friends in the shape of a small volume entitled “Transatlantic
 Sketches,” which is written in a light conversational style. As stated
above, Professor Kelland was a clergyman of the Church of England, and
he occasionally officiated in St. James’ and other Episcopal Churches.
 Preaching, however, was, in the opinion of his friends, one of the few
accomplishments in which he did not excel.          Professor Kelland was
twice married—first to Miss     Pilkington,   of Dublin, and subsequently
to Miss   Boswell, the only  daughter  of the late Captain  Boswell, R.N.,
of Wardie. His widow, three sons, and two daughters survive him.
In politics he took little interest; and it is said that the only occasion
on which he was known to vote was at the first School Board election,
when he voted for the lady candidates.
    The class-room was undoubtedly Professor Kelland's proper sphere.
As a teacher he has been equalled by few and surpassed by none of
the many colleagues alongside of whom he has laboured.              In the
Royal Society he was always regarded as an authority on mathematical
and physical subjects. His notes, though not numerous, were much
valued, and his criticisms were listened to with respect. But he had
little ambition to shine as an explorer, whatever his capacity might be.
Fate had made him a teacher, and to that work he bent all his energies.
His function was less to make discoveries than to methodise, adapt,
and disseminate the discoveries of others.         This implied that he
should be a student as well as a     teacher,  and one chief cause of his
success in the latter capacity was his preseverance in the former.
None who witnessed it can have forgotten the enthusiasm and delight
with which he first assimilated and then reproduced in his class the
doctrine of Quaternions developed by Sir William Rowan Hamilton
upwards of twenty years ago. Then he was both student and teacher
at the same moment.         The members of his class were his fellow
students.    His morning demonstrations were instinct with the fresh
ness of the evening's discoveries, and his face beamed with delight
and his eye twinkled with triumph as his rapid fingers worked out the
beautiful results on the board. As a teacher his one fault was that he
rushed forward somewhat too rapidly for the majority of his hearers.
One reason of this was, that he assumed rather too high a standard of
attainment on the part of entrants to the University. Another reason
of it was that he had a large amount of work to do and little time in
which to do it. He therefore carried on the few rather than the

                                    X.
many.      But   those who had the needful   ability, and had the power of
work in them, followed him with the utmost interest, and generally
pronounced him, when in his prime at least, the best professor in the
Faculty of Arts. Personally he was much beloved by his students.
He was a man of genial temperament and kindliness of heart; and he
was ever ready to help deserving students, and to encourage those
whom difficulties might have deterred from presevering in their work.
When acting as substitute for Professor Forbes in the Chair of Natural
Philosophy,     discovered a power of popular lecturing of which
                 he
he did not seem to have been himself aware, and which was quite
new to his friends and even to his students. The lectures he fre
quently delivered before the Philosophical Institution were one result
of this discovery.   Of all the departments of physics with which
he dealt, Acoustics was the one in which he took the greatest delight,
probably    becausehis skill as a violinist went hand-in-hand with
his ability   as a mathematician. Perhaps the most successful of
his   lectures were those on the lives and labours of eminent
natural philosophers, as Kepler, Galileo, and Newton.         The literary
finish, the sparkle of wit, and the soundness of judgment by which
these lectures were characterised make it a cause of regret that his
efforts in literature were generally so strictly professional.     Of his
contributions to the Proceedings of the Royal Societies of London and
Edinburgh and to the Philosophical Society of Cambridge, twenty-six
papers are particularly specified in the catalogue of the first-mentioned
scientific body. He published works on “The Theory of Heat,” in
1837 and 1842; treatises on “Algebra,” in 1839 and 1860; and in
1873, an “Introduction to Quaternions,” conjointly with his colleague,
Professor Guthrie Tait. The introductory and valedictory addresses
which he occasionally delivered to his classes, sometimes dealt with
the question of University reform.   On this subject his views inclined
to Conservatism.    Two of these lectures were published—the one in
1854, entitled “The Scottish Universities      suited to the Scottish
People,” and the other in 1855, with the title, “How to improve the
Scottish Universities.”  Almost his latest work, and that which is
most worthy of his reputation as a mathematician, is the article on
“Algebra,” contributed to the ninth edition of the “Encyclopaedia
Britannica.       He was elected    a    Fellow of the Royal Society in
1838.
   Sir THOMAS LARCOM, who died at Heathfield, Fareham, Hants, on
June 15, was the last survivor of that remarkable band of officers of
the Royal Engineers, many of whom were Fellows of this Society,
whose names will never be forgotten in connexion with the Ordnance
Survey of Ireland. That Survey, the model in         its
                                                  grand comprehen

                                        xi
siveness of the Survey of Great Britain, is perhaps, considering the
period at which it was executed, the highest result of British practical
science of which this country can boast, and was the work of no
common men.        As they have been removed one by one from among
us, notices of Colby, Drummond, and Portlock have appeared in our
pages; Murphy was drowned in the Euphrates on Colonel Chesney's
Expedition; Robe, Sir William Reid, and Dawson passed away long
ago. Of these General Colby was the master and tutor.             Selected in
1824   by the  discerning  eye of the Duke of    Wellington   for the task of
executing the Survey of Ireland, and leaving it completed in 1846,
his success was what might have been expected from the well-proved
fertility of his inventive genius, his extraordinary force of character
and self-devotion, the high moral tone which was sure to propagate
itself amongst his staff.        If  others invented, enlarged, improved,
suggested, executed,—to Colby, the Commander-in-Chief, the main
credit of the Survey must always belong.
   The only officer of this band to whose career, as a whole, that of
Larcom bears any similarity, is the lamented Drummond; but Drum
mond's early death prevented the full development of talents which
would certainly have raised his already great fame to a still higher level
than it actually attained; Larcom was permitted for a period of more
than forty years to become identified with what may be called his
adopted country; and his memoirs would be to a very great extent a
history, for his period, of Ireland itself. Like Drummond, the work
which he accomplished on the Irish Survey pointed him out as the
proper person to organize and administer various branches of the Civil
Service; and like him, he was made Under-Secretary for Ireland,
with the marked approval of the public. It is of this varied service
that we must make a brief sketch.
   Sir Thomas Larcom resembled Generals Colby and Portlock in one
respect, rather than Drummond.          Like the two Generals, he was the
son of a  distinguished   sea officer;  and the sense of duty, the undaunted
energy, the practical sagacity which all three inherited, may very
clearly and very similarly be traced in their career.             His father,
Captain Joseph Larcom, R.N., who saw much active service, was best
known by the office he held for some years as Commissioner of Malta
Dockyard, on his way home from which post he died in 1817.                Sir
Thomas was born in 1801, joined the corps of Royal Engineers at
Chatham, with a high reputation from Woolwich, in 1821, and served
his first two years at Gibraltar. His early character, on its scientific
side, was formed under men of genius, General Mudge, R.A., the
successor of General Roy in the first operations of the English Survey,
and Sir Charles Pasley, the founder of the Engineering School at
Chatham.      Under these officers, while learning the rudiments of his
profession, he imbibed his      full share of that combined military and

                                       xii
 scientific zeal which grew out of the experiences of the Peninsular
 War, and was perhaps best represented before the eyes of later gene
 rations by Sir John Burgoyne, one of Larcom's truest friends.            In
 1824, Larcom commenced his labours in the Ordnance Survey of Eng
 land, but was selected by Major Colby for the Irish Survey in 1826.
 Here he found himself happily coupled with one who had been known
 to him from boyhood, the late General Portlock, in those arduous
 operations of the Trigonometrical Survey by which Ireland was con
 nected with the sister island in a network of triangulation.        In 1828
 he was entrusted     by  General   Colby  with the central  organization  at
 Dublin of the whole Survey. To him was assigned, under the imme
 diate command of his chief, the task of examining and comparing all
 the plans and documents as they were sent in from all portions of the
 Survey, of compiling them into county maps, engraving, and finally
 publishing them. To him fell the training and discipline of an army
 of draftsmen, computers, engravers, and printers, a large proportion
 of whom were men of his own corps. While in this position, he
 deserves the credit of adopting and of adapting every invention, such
 as that of electrotype, by which economy could be secured and produc
tion multiplied; and every Continental improvement, such as that of
 Contouring,    a novelty    at first warmly opposed, but gradually tri
 umphant.     In the course of a very few years the establishment at
Mountjoy, in Phoenix Park, was without an equal in the world, the
pride of Ireland, the admiration of scientific travellers.      It was after
wards transferred to      Southampton    under the able  superintendence   of
his brother officer, Sir Henry James.
    But Larcom was not only distinguished as a scientific man, he was
pre-eminently the literary man of the party; and his mental activity
was early displayed in promoting that enlargement of the original
idea of the Survey which General Colby was wise enough to encourage.
In the preface to the “Memoir of Templemore,” the General says:—
“Lieutenant Larcom conceived the idea that with such opportunities
a small additional      cost would enable him, without retarding the
execution of the maps, to draw together a work embracing every
description of local information relating to Ireland. He submitted this
idea to me, and    I obtained the sanction of the Irish Government for
carrying it into     effect.  To him    I  have entrusted the execution,
and this volume is the first public result.”         Colby himself, as his
biographer, General Portlock, admits, “was not an antiquarian;”
Larcom was.      He applied himself to the study of the Irish language,
in order to qualify himself for his self-imposed task; and under his
enthusiastic guidance competent persons searched every record, and
made every personal investigation necessary for the historical and
literary branch of the Survey.         A vast body of information, of the
highest value, was gradually collected;       much of  it already digested;

                                                      xiii
the ideal would shortly have been realized, but, from motives of
economy, the Government suspended operations, and the organic
whole, to Larcom's intense disappointment, was not to be the crown
ing glory of the Ordnance Survey. Its component parts, however,
were in time undertaken by various scientific bodies, some of which
took their rise from these very operations now suspended. Years
afterwards, the President of the Royal Irish Academy, the present
distinguished Bishop of Limerick, referred to Sir Thomas Larcom in
the following words:—“For my own part,                                 I
                                               do not hesitate to express
my belief that to the individual who planned and organized it [the
Survey, as to its literary, historical, and statistical branches] we are
indebted for some of the most important advances which have been
made within the last quarter of a century in the studies relating to
the history, the languages, and the antiquities of Ireland.   To Lieu
tenant, now Major-General Sir Thomas Larcom, belongs this honour.”
(“Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy,” VII, 437.) During the
eight concluding years of the Irish Survey, Larcom had the entire
executive charge of             it,
                         his chief's presence being required   London                              in
for the English  Survey.
      1846, when the Irish Survey was completed, Larcom was finally
     In
                                                                       as
adopted into the Civil Service       Ireland,     of

extension      the old method since adopted
               of                                       Great Britain and onin
the Continent.             In   1842       he   had been     a    Commissioner     inquire into
                                                                                             to
the state      of   the Royal Irish Society, and                  in1845, for purposes relating
to the new Queen's Colleges.
   For none of these Commissions or other work                                   of     the sort would           he
ever receive         any remuneration;                and        to   this resolution              he     adhered,

when, in subsequent years, he collected Returns of agricultural produce
for the Government, when he was made Chief Commissioner for inquiry
into the Irish Poor Law in 1848, and in the next year held the same
place in the Commission for the reform of the Dublin Corporation.
The importance of the Reports of the Boundary Commissions, over
which he presided, may be judged by the fact that the Unions and
electoral districts of Ireland were remodelled in accordance with the
suggestions contained in them. In 1850 he became Deputy Chairman
of the Board of Works; and in the year following, a member of the
Senate of the Queen's University.
   It will thus be seen that in the process which placed Ireland, during
a rapid course of scientific inquiry and judicious improvement, far
ahead of the larger island, Larcom was certainly one of the principal
agents; and, indeed, it would be difficult to mention any one name more
immediately concerned in producing that result. It was almost, then,
a matter of course, that when a vacancy occurred in the Irish Under
Secretaryship, he should be selected for that post in 1853; but it
distinguishes him from all others who have held                  it,
                                                       that the office was

had     often marred her prosperity; religious and political differences
       so
were restrained by the strong hand from disturbing the peace; and
the grievances which were inseparable from such       past history were                   a
mitigated         by

the House    of Commons from 1839 to        1857, when, on his retirement,
he was raised to the    Peerage  under the title of Wiscount Eversley.
    The second   son, John,  was born in 1797, and was educated at Eton
and Cambridge.        At the University his career was most honourable;
though of feeble health, which at that time never permitted him to
work for more than six hours a day, he was Senior Wrangler in 1818,
a year remarkable      for the number of men of ability who passed in
honours and who subsequently distinguished themselves; he was
elected Fellow of Trinity in the following year, and was called to the
Bar by the Inner Temple in 1824. For some years he practised as a
conveyancer with success; but after a time was gradually drawn away
into political employment. In 1832 he was employed by the Govern
ment of the day to arrange the divisions of counties for representa
tion under the Reform Act.           In the same year he was elected
member for Petersfield by a majority of one, but was unseated on a
scrutiny.    Shortly after he was appointed Under Secretary of State
for the Colonies, by the Secretary of State, Mr. Stanley, after
wards Earl of Derby.         In 1834 he undertook the work of Poor
Law Commissioner, under the Act passed in that session for the
amendment of the Poor Law. His work involved the entire organisa
tion of the new system, the arrangement of Poor Law Unions over
the whole country, and the building of workhouses, in the face of
vehement opposition from a large part of the Press and the public.
He held this post for seven years, till 1841, when the work began to
tell upon his health, he then exchanged this office for that of
Secretary of the Board of Trade, which he held till the year 1848,
when he was appointed Clerk of the Parliaments, an office which he
held till his final retirement in 1875, four years before his death. His
official duties connected with these offices formed, however, but a
small part of his work; he was employed by successive Governments
in a great number of Commissions and Inquiries involving great
labour. In 1834 he was one of the Commissioners entrusted by Lord
 Glenelg with the foundation of the Colony of South Australia; he
was also one of the Founders of the University of London, and in
 1842 succeeded the late Sir John Lubbock as Vice-Chancellor of the
 University, a post which he filled for twenty years till 1862. In 1842
he was a member of a Commission to inquire into the recent losses of
 Exchequer Bills; in 1843 he was appointed member of the Emigra
 tion Commission; in 1846 he was employed by the Government on
 a mission to Edinburgh, which resulted in founding the National
 Academy in that city; in the same year he was employed as
arbitrator to settle the questions in dispute between the Colonial Office
and the New Zealand Company. About the same time he contested the
 representation of the University of Cambridge in the Liberal interest,
 but without success. Shortly afterwards he was appointed a member

                                   xvii
 of the . Ecclesiastical Commission, and for many years was one of
 the Commissioners for managing the estates of the Bishops and
 Cathedral bodies. In 1848 he again went on a mission to Edinburgh,
 and reported upon the vexed questions of the Annuity Tax and the
 Fishery Board. In 1851 he was appointed member of a Commission
 to inquire into the appointments to the Civil Service of India, the
 other Commissioners being Lord Ashburton, Lord Macaulay, Mr.
 Melville, and Professor Jowett, and the result of their labours was
 the establishment of competitive examinations for the entry into
the Indian Civil Service.     In 1853 he was one of a Commission to
inquire into the Inns of Court; their recommendations, however,
involving an entire reconstitution of these bodies and the utilization
 of their great income for the purpose of legal education, have not as
 yet been carried out, although some stimulus was given to changes in
 this direction. In 1858 Sir John Lefevre was appointed member of an
 Executive Commission with Sir Edward Ryan, to carry out arrange
 ments for insuring competent appointments to the Civil Service in
 England; for some years this was confined to requiring pass examina
tions as the test of competency, but later the principle of competition
was introduced, of which he was always a warm supporter.              For
many years, in conjunction with Sir Edward Ryan, he elaborated the
system of competition and carried it out universally throughout the
 Civil Service. He was also a member of the Commission for restoring
the Standards, for the Digest of the Statutes, and for inquiry into the
Endowed Schools. It was on work of this kind that his qualities of
patient inquiry, quickness of insight, and powers of persuasion were
so conspicuous, and led to his services being so frequently called in aid
by the Government.       All this work on Commissions and Inquiries
was undertaken without claim for pay or reward; but in 1857, the
distinction of the Order of the Bath was conferred on him. His
numerous official duties did not prevent his devoting his spare
hours to literary and scientific work, and even to work of other
kind. He was one of the first Directors of the London and North
Western Railway; he was one of the Founders of the Athenaeum
Club and of the Political Economy Club. He was a Fellow of the
Royal Society (elected 1820) and a member of many other learned
societies.   In addition to his mathematical acquirements, which he
maintained to the latest period of life, he was able to devote much
time to literature. He had a great facility for learning languages, and,
besides that of Hebrew, mastered all the languages of Europe; he
commenced to study Russian after the age of 65, but even after this
found time to acquire a most extensive knowledge of its literature.
In 1875 he was compelled by a severe attack of illness to retire from
office, but he continued to devote himself without remission to his
literary studies; he died on the 20th of August, 1879, at the age of
   WOL. XXIX.                                                 C

 his  faculties, with undimmed memory and intellect, with unabated
interest in public affairs, and retaining to the last that ever-ready
fund of sympathy and that sweetness of character which so much
endeared him to his friends and relations.
    SIR THOMAS MACLEAR, the eldest son of the Rev. James Maclear,
of Newton Stewart, Tyrone, Ireland, was born on the 17th of March,
1794.    At the age of fifteen he was placed under the care of relatives
in England, and educated for the medical profession, studying at Guy's
and Bartholomew's Hospitals.       He had excellent prospects in London,
but, preferring a more quiet life, he obtained the appointment of House
Surgeon to the Bedford Infirmary, and at this place, in the society of
the late Admiral Smyth, he had opportunities of employing himself
occasionally in the practice of astronomy, a science for which he had
early shown a predilection.     In 1823 he moved to Biggleswade, and
here erected a small observatory, in which he spent most of the time
he could spare from the practice of his profession. In 1825 he married
Mary Pearse, daughter of one of his Bedford friends.
   In 1833, probably through the recommendation of Admiral Smyth
and Sir John Herschel, he was appointed Astronomer at the Cape of
Good Hope.       He reached his new sphere of labour in January, 1834.
Less than a fortnight later Sir John Herschel arrived at the Cape to
make the survey of the southern heavens, which occupied him four
years, and the two astronomers assisted each other during this period
with heart and hand. The transit instrument and the mural circle
were kept in constant use by Maclear and his single assistant, the result
being that in the clear skies of the Cape observations accumulated far
beyond the limited powers of reduction.
   In the early part of 1838 he commenced his great undertaking, the
verification of Lacaille's arc of the meridian, the field-work for which
was completed in 1847. It has formed the basis for the survey of the
colony, and has given to it a character and completeness which might
otherwise have been wanting.      The results of this important geodetic
operation were published in two quarto volumes in 1866, under the
editorship of Sir George Airy. In 1849 Maclear's means for extra
meridional observations were increased by the mounting of a 7-inch
Merz refractor, he having previously been limited to the use of a
Dollond achromatic of 46 inches focal length. Many valuable series of
observations of comets when beyond reach at the European observa
tories were thus obtained, and have been of the greatest assistance in
the accurate determination of their orbits. Between the years 1849–
1853 the whole of the stars  of the British Association Catalogue having
south declination were observed by Maclear with the meridian instru
ments.    The reduction of these observations, as of others, was much

                                      xix
delayed by the amount of time and attention given to work connected
with the verification of Lacaille's arc, so that it has happened that the
present astronomer is now engaged upon the formation of a catalogue
from them for the epoch 1850.
    In 1859, Maclear visited England for a few months. He returned
to the Cape in the following year, and after this time his attention
was mainly directed to the reduction of his previous observations.
He reduced the series made in the interval 1835–40, which, after
revision by his successor, Mr. E. J. Stone, has been formed into a
catalogue for 1840, containing 2,892 stars. He also partly reduced
the observations in the years 1856–60, a work completed by Mr. Stone,
and published as the “Cape Catalogue for 1860,” which contains
1,159 stars. Amongst his miscellaneous astronomical work was the
determination of the parallaxes of a and 8 Centauri, confirming for
the first of these stars the result of his predecessor, Henderson.
    Maclear continued closely occupied with his astronomical duties
until 1870, when he retired from the direction of the Cape Observa
 tory, still continuing to reside in the vicinity, and taking a very lively
 and active interest, as he had previously done, in every matter tending
 to promote the well-being of the colony, in which he was greatly
 esteemed and respected.      Latterly, his sight failed him, and for several
 years before his death he was quite blind.       He was much interested in
 the exploration of South Africa; and the last occasion on which he
 left his house was to attend a meeting in Cape Town, when Stanley
 visited the colony. He died at his residence, Grey Villa, Mowbray,
 Cape of Good Hope, on July 14, 1879.           He was elected a Fellow of
 the Royal Society in 1831, Member of the Academy of Sciences of
 Palermo in 1835, and a Correspondent of the Institute of France in
 1863.     For his verification and extension of Lacaille's arc, he received
  the Lalande Prize from the French Academy of Sciences in 1867, and
  a Royal Medal in    1869 from the   Royal Society. Maclear was knighted
 in  1860.
     In proof of the estimation in which Sir Thomas Maclear was held in
  the Cape Colony, it may be mentioned that the following resolution
  was agreed to in the House of Assembly on the 17th of July last:—
  “That this House desires to express its deep sense of the signal ser
  vices rendered by the late Sir Thomas Maclear, Knt., F.R.S., F.R.A.S.,
  to the general cause of Astronomical and Geographical Science while
  in charge of the Royal Observatory, Cape Town, and also to the
  material interests of the colony in the practical application of his
  researches; and, furthermore, its high appreciation of his devotion for
  a long period of years to the cause of South African exploration and
  civilization; and that this Resolution be recorded in the journals of
  the House.”

   MR. ANTHONY MERVYN REEVE STORY-MASKELYNE was born May 8th.
1791.   He was descended from the family of Story, who were settled
at  Know,   in the county of Cumberland, but being Jacobites were
obliged to leave that part of the country after the Rebellion of 1715.
Mr. Story-Maskelyne's grandfather settled at Oxford soon after 1715,
and died there in 1751.    He had a son, William Story, who was born
in 1734, and became rector of Hinton-Martell, county Dorset, on the
presentation of the Earl of Shaftesbury.       This gentleman was the
father of the  subject  of the   present memoir. Mr. Story-Maskelyne
lost his father  early in  life,  but his mother survived her husband
till 1827. The care and education of her son fell to her, and Mr.
Story-Maskelyne often spoke with pride and gratitude of her de
votion and judicious management.          When he went up to Oxford
and entered at Wadham College he found himself far behind the
scholarship of the place, but with a spirit for work and a passion for
knowledge with which his mother had inspired him, he would tell
with some humour of his first essay for a scholarship, when, on a
friend inquiring “how he had done,” the answer was that he had
made four false quantities in the first two lines of an ode of Horace.
But this remark was the spur to that undaunted effort which resulted
in the remarkable          success   of a “double-first.” When Mr. Story
Maskelyne took his              “double-first,” in 1810, aged just nineteen,
only three men before him had won that honour, Sir Robert Peel,
Mr. C. Bathurst, and the Rev. J. Keble; and when we remember his
imperfect preparation for Oxford and his final success, we can only be
astonished at the labour and the ability which were required and
expended to achieve          it.
                          The late Warden      Wadham, Dr. Symons,
                                                                of
was his  tutor,  and may well share the praise       such work. Mr.       of
Story-Maskelyne,   having selected the bar        his profession, wasas
called   in   1816,   and went        on     Circuit for five
                                           the   Western          six                         or
years.  He was     elected
                      a       Fellow a   the Royal  Society
                                                      of        1823.                    in
Tempting offers came      him afterwards. By his degree,
                                to                          had made                he

                                                                                                   of of
himself  aman
that day proposed      him to  bring him into Parliament for one
                                      to
those boroughs which, before the Reform                    Bill, were          at
                                                                                the command
of   their    “owners.”         This Mr. Story-Maskelyne                   declined, for the
acceptance     of
                the offer would have bound him           party—perhaps    to
                                                                          a
almost   to
          the  opinions    his patron,
                                of      and     was the characteristic
                                                           it                                      of
his mind then, and till the last,         the independent master

own opinions.    But       most probable that his marriage with Miss
                           it   is
Margaret Maskelyne, the only child       the Rev. Dr. Maskelyne, F.R.S.,
                                                 of
Astronomer   Royal,  gave the turn and character       his career which   to
continued     to
              the end.   Mr. Maskelyne's marriage took place        1819,                in
and the ancient patrimony        the Maskelynes
                                      of             Purton and Bassett
                                                                     at
Down came with his wife,       sole heiress,
                                     as        him,        to

                                     xxi
    But perhaps the withdrawal of Mr. Maskelyne from all public and
county business may have another explanation, at least supplementary
to that to which we have here ascribed it. His tastes were those of
an educated and well-read gentleman.         To him the treasures of the
great minds of Greece and Rome were as completely open as are
those of our own language to us, and we know that to within a very
few years of his death he still enjoyed the beauty and wisdom laid up
in their works, and found his rest and enjoyment there. Perhaps
with such tastes and such occupations, a want of sympathy from
others or a want of congeniality of taste in others, led him to sepa
rate himself from those useful and honourable men to whom this
country     owes   so much for their care   of our national and county
affairs.
     Mrs. Story-Maskelyne died in 1858, so that her husband has sur
 vived her twenty-one years. She inherited from her father much of
 his great ability, and was enabled to correct the press for the last
 publications he wrote.       But her kindly heart, and a charity that
 checked all expression, all feeling of an unkind thought, are the great
 charms by which she is best remembered now.
     SIR JAMES MATHEson, Baronet, was the second son of Captain
 Donald Matheson, of Shiness, in the county of Sutherland, and
 was born in 1796.        He was educated at the High School and
 University of Edinburgh, and after a few years' business training in
 London, he went out to the East, and engaged in mercantile pursuits.
 He     was one of the founders of the eminent house of Jardine,
 Matheson, and Co., in China.      In 1836, during a visit to this country,
 he published a volume on the China trade, which threw light on a
 subject not then much understood. In 1842, he finally retired from
 business with an ample fortune, and in the following year married
 Mary Jane, daughter of Mr. Michael H. Perceval, a member of the
 Legislative Council of Quebec.
     Having acquired the estate of Achany in his native county,
 Mr. Matheson in 1844 purchased from the Seaforth family the Island
 of Lewis, in the Hebrides, and made it for the most part his home.
  It was  his earnest desire to improve the condition of the large popu
 lation on this estate, and with large-hearted and liberal plans he
 entered upon his self-imposed task, employing the most able assistants
  whom he could find to carry out his projects.       Large outlays were
 made    in the construction of roads and bridges over the whole island,
  in  draining   and reclaiming waste land, in establishing steam com
  munication with the south, and in promoting education.           Scarcely
  had he begun these various works when, in common with Ireland, the
  west Highlands were visited by the potato disease, and many thousands
  of persons on his property were threatened with famine. His untiring

                                      xxii
efforts at that time, and the munificent provision which he made for
meeting the distress, can never be forgotten.         They were not un
observed by Her Majesty's Government, and in recognition of his
generous conduct he was created a baronet.
    Sir James entered Parliament in    1843, as member for Ashburton, and
in    1847  he  was returned     for the combined counties of Ross and
Cromarty, for which he continued to sit until 1868.          He was elected
a Fellow    of the Royal Society in 1846. He died at Mentone on the
31st December last, aged 82.        Lady Matheson survives him.
    JoHN MIERS was born in London on the 25th of August, 1789. He
entered his father's business as a jeweller, but evincing a decided
inclination for scientific research, devoted himself in his leisure hours
to the study of the physical sciences, and especially of chemistry and
mineralogy.      At this early period of his life he undertook a series of
experimental researches in the endeavour to demonstrate the com
pound nature of azote, which resulted in the publication of two papers
on this subject in Thomson’s “Annals of Philosophy,” in the year
1814; he also took a leading part in the foundation of the “Philoso
phical Society of London”—an institution with which many young
men who in after years distinguished           themselves in science were
connected. At this time he made the acquaintance of Michael
Faraday.
    In  1818 he married, and shortly after, at the invitation  of his friend.
Lord Cochrane (afterwards Earl         Dundonald),   proceeded   to Chili to
 assist in the erection of extensive machinery for the reduction and
manufacture of copper;        an enterprise in which both were interested.
 Landing at Buenos Ayres, he traversed the Pampas and the Cordil
 leras, and, during six years' residence in the country, devoted his
 leisure time to the study of its Flora and Fauna.         Although at this
 time unacquainted with the elements of botany, he gradually acquired
 a practical knowledge of the science by numerous dissections and
 observations upon the plants of Chili in the living state. He returned
 to England in 1825, and during a stay of a few months obtained per
 sonal introductions to Robert Brown and Dr. Lindley, who encouraged
 him in his studies. In 1826, shortly after his return to South America,
 was published his “Travels in Chili and La Plata,” in two volumes,
 a work which was for long regarded as a standard authority on the
 geography of the countries and customs of the people with which it
 dealt.    He twice again traversed the Pampas, and afterwards resided
 for seven years in Rio de Janeiro, where he had contracted to erect a
 Mint for the Brazilian Government, and where, although incessantly
  engaged in his professional duties, he added largely to his botanical
  and entomological collections.
     Mr. Miers returned to England finally in 1838, and from this period

                                                          xxiii
the commencement of his scientific career may be dated. He con
tributed numerous papers on the botany of South America to the
“Transactions” and “Journal” of the Linnean Society, the London
“Journal of Botany,” and the “Annals and Magazine of Natural
History.”     He also published several larger works, which although
 •onsisting in great part of reprints of his smaller memoirs, are enriched
  with many additional observations, and with numerous plates executed
from his original drawings, and many of them drawn by himself on
the stone. His “Illustrations of South American Botany” appeared
in 1850, and his “Contributions,” in three volumes, followed in 1867,
1869, and 1871; the third and concluding volume of the latter work
is occupied exclusively with his “Monograph of Menispermaceous
Plants,” and is the most valuable of his contributions to science. His
latest volume, a “Memoir on the Apocynaceae,” was published in 1878,
when         its
          author was      his 89th year.
                                       in
   Mr. Miers was elected F.L.S.        1839, and F.R.S.   in1843, and was               in
a  member      several foreign learned Societies.

the Brazilian Section       the International Exhibition
                                          of                 1862, and for                 of
his services the Emperor conferred upon him the Cross and Grand
 Cross    the Imperial Order
             of                    the Rose.         of
        As
        botanist, Mr. Miers was distinguished by the extreme careful
             a
ness and accuracy      his observations and descriptions, and the great
beauty and fidelity               of of
                        his drawings and analyses. He was        the last                            to
 anopponent      the theoryof    Evolution.    private life

        CHARLEs        MURCHISON            was born        in    Jamaica        in   1830.        Some time
afterwards, his father, who belonged         Scotch family, and was    to   a
nearly related   Sir Roderick
                            toMurchison,  left the West Indies, where
 he had been practising       physician, and returning

 but they obtained for him so much esteem amongst his fellow students
 as to lead to his election as one of the Presidents of the Royal
 Medical Society.       Before taking his degree he had obtained the
 Licentiateship of the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh, and had
 acted as House Surgeon for Mr. Syme.         After his graduation, at the
 age of twenty-one he became Physician to the British Embassy at
 Turin. In the following year he returned to Edinburgh and acted
for a while as resident Clinical Physician in the Infirmary. After
resigning this appointment he studied for a short time in Dublin and
Paris. He then entered the Honourable East India Company's service,
and soon after his arrival in Calcutta, was appointed Professor of
Chemistry in the Medical College.        During the Burmese War he was
attached to the Army Medical Staff, and in 1855 he returned to
London.      Very soon afterwards he was appointed Lecturer in Botany
at St. Mary's Hospital. He was subsequently connected with King's
College Hospital, the Middlesex, St. Thomas's Hospital, and in the
latter two schools held the appointment of Lecturer on Medicine.
    In addition to these appointments, he held for many years that of
Assistant Physician and afterwards of Physician to the London Fever
Hospital, an     office  which demanded much time       as  well as much
labour.
    The subjects to which Murchison devoted his attention as an
original observer were botany, pathology, and medicine.       Botany was
the   subject which he first took    up.   He  began to study  it while in
Aberdeen, and prosecuted it vigorously in Edinburgh under Professor
Balfour, in whose class     he obtained the medal for the best herbarium.
Three    years  afterwards he contributed his first original paper on
“Glandular Organs in Plants” to the Botanical Society of Edinburgh.
As his attention became directed to other subjects, his botanical
studies were more or less interrupted.      He continued them in Burmah
and again resumed them when he became Lecturer on Botany to
St. Mary's, at which time he contributed several original papers to
various journals, but they were almost entirely discontinued after he
ceased to lecture on botany, his powers then becoming more con
centrated on the subjects of pathology and medicine.
    His first original pathological observations were made during his
tenure of office as House Surgeon under Mr. Syme, and were embodied
in his thesis on “The Pathology of Morbid Growths,” for which he
obtained a gold medal at his graduation.
    From the time of his connexion with St. Mary’s Hospital, his in
terest in pathology remained undiminished up to the time of his death.
His contributions to the “Transactions of the Pathological Society.”
were very numerous, and his services to this subject were recognised
by his appointment, in 1877, as President of the Pathological Society.
 His most valuable contributions to medicine were his works on “The

                                    XXV
Continued Fevers of Great Britain,” and on     “The Functional Diseases
of the Liver.”                        -
   The opportunities for observation which his position as Physician
to the London Fever Hospital afforded, were used by him so diligently
that he was able in this work to lay down the distinctions between the
various continued fevers as regards their causes, symptoms, and patho
logical conditions with great clearness and accuracy; and thus he
contributed in no inconsiderable degree to the general acceptance of
the views now held regarding the etiology of typhoid fever, and which
have already been of such service in regard to its prevention.
   His work on “Disease of the Liver” was characterised, like all his
other writings, by such careful observation of facts and accuracy of
statement, as to render it a most useful aid in the diagnosis of the
diseases of which    it treated.
   As  a teacher  of clinical medicine, Murchison has left few equals in
this  country.   The system he followed was modified on that of his old
teacher, Dr. Hughes Bennett.        The essential part of the plan was
first to excite the attention of the students by skilfully putting ques
tions, and then to satisfy the desire for information which he had thus
awakened, instead of at once stating to them facts in which they took
no interest.    The extent of his knowledge and his methodical habit of
mind, combined with the admirable plan of teaching which he adopted,
left a deep impression on the students whom he taught, and his per
sonal influence will long be felt in his writings. He was elected a
 Fellow of the Royal Society in 1866.
    ARTHUR HAY, 9th Marquis of Tweeddale, President of the Zoological
Society of London, was born on the 9th November, 1824, the second
son of his father, the previous Marquis, who was a Field-Marshal, and
a well-known Peninsular veteran. In April, 1841, Lord Arthur Hay,
as he was then called, obtained a commission in the Grenadier Guards,
and, on obtaining the rank of Captain in 1842, proceeded to India as
Aide-de-camp to his father, who was at that time Commander-in
 Chief at Madras.     It was at this period of his life that Lord Arthur
 Hay made the acquaintance of the late Dr. Jerdon, the distinguished
 Indian naturalist, who was then Assistant-Surgeon at Fort St. George.
 The two saw much of each other, and worked together at various
 branches of matural history; and the friendship thus formed was
 renewed when Dr. Jerdon retired from the Service and returned to
 England in 1869. At the commencement of the Sutlej Campaign of
 1845–46 Lord Arthur Hay was appointed Aide-de-camp to Lord Har
 dinge, the Commander-in-Chief,     and was present on his Staff at the
 decisive battle of Sobraon. On the 9th March, 1846, the Treaty was con
 cluded by which the whole of the hill territory west of the Sutlej and

                                   xxvi
Cashmere was handed over to the British; and a few days afterwards
the second Treaty, by which the Kashmir portion was transferred to
the Maharajah Golab Singh, was executed. Shortly after this, Lord
Arthur Hay, with other officers, among whom were Lord Elphinstone,
Lord James Brown, Captain H. Bates, and Lieutenant A. Hardinge,
obtained leave to visit this part of the Himalayas; and, after being
received with marked courtesy by the Maharajah at his ancestral resi
dence of Jummoo, they crossed by the Banihal Pass into the valley of
Kashmir. After spending a month there, Lord Arthur Hay and Lord
Hardinge started for Ballastan, or Little Tibet, vià the Kishengunga
Valley and the Dessai Plains, and, after visiting Skardo, travelled on
to Leh, in Ladakh, and thence through Rupshu to cross the high
pass, the Parang La (19,000 feet), finally ending their tour at Simla.
The party met with a good deal of trouble and vexatious delay in
this latter part of the journey, which at that period was of a venture
some, if not of a dangerous nature.     Lord Arthur Hay was, through
out this journey, engaged in his favourite study, and made a large
collection of the birds of the country.
   During his stay in India, Lord Arthur Hay, although much inte
rested in natural history, and on terms of intimacy with Dr. Jerdon,
Mr. Blyth, Sir Walter Elliot, and other Indian naturalists, gave very
little of the results of his studies to the public. We can only find
published during this period the two articles in the “Madras Journal,”
which stand at the head of the subjoined list.
    During the next period of his life, Lord Arthur Hay, who assumed
the title of Wiscount Walden in 1862, on the death of his elder brother,
Lord Gifford, was too much     engaged with his military duties and other
matters to be able to do much scientific work.        In 1854 he accom
panied the army sent out to Turkey, and thence to the Crimea, and
took part in the campaign which resulted in the fall of Sebastopol.
In 1866 Lord Walden finally retired from active service, and com
menced anew a collection of birds and ornithological books in a house
which he built for himself at Chislehurst, and which was for the ten
following years his habitual residence. He became a frequent contri
butor to “The Ibis,” to the Zoological Society’s “Proceedings” and
“Transactions,” the “Annals of Natural History,” paying special
attention to the birds of India and the Eastern Archipelago.           In
1868, Lord Walden, upon the death of Sir George Clerk, was elected
President of the Zoological Society of London, of the Council of
which he was already a member, and retained this office, discharging
the duties with the greatest zeal and success, until his death. He was
elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1871.
    On the death of his father, at a very advanced age, in 1876, Lord
 Walden succeeded to the peerage and estates, and transferred his
 home and collections to the ancestral seat of Yester, in East Lothian,

                                   xxvii
where he subsequently passed the greater part of his time. During
the past two years Lord Tweeddale devoted special attention to the
investigation of the avifauna of the Philippine Archipelago.     Mr. A.
H. Everett,   a well-known collector, was specially engaged to visit the
different islands of this group, and make collections of their birds;
and the results were given to the public in a series of thirteen papers
published in the Zoological Society’s “Proceedings,” the last of which
was finished only a few days before the death of the author.
   Another important piece of ornithological work recently under
taken by Lord Tweeddale was the editing, with notes and additions,
of the part relating to the birds of “Blyth's Catalogue of the Mammals
and Birds of Burma,” which was left in a very unfinished state at the
author's decease.     Under Lord Tweeddale’s “able and conscientious
treatment,” to use the words of Mr. Grote, the catalogue became a
complete list of all the known Burman species, and a most useful
work to ornithologists.
   Lord Tweeddale died at his English residence, Walden Cottage,
Chislehurst, on the 29th December, 1878, after a very short illness.
His collections of birds and scientific books are bequeathed to his
nephew, Mr. Robert Wardlaw Ramsay, a well-known member of this
Union.
   JoHN WATERHOUSE was born at Halifax, Yorkshire, on the 3rd
August, 1806.
   Very early in life he evinced a decided preference for scientific
studies; his school training increased this preference and enabled him
to obtain a sufficient knowledge of mathematical science, which he
turned to good account in after years in various branches of physical
research.
   A certain weakness of constitution which prevented him in his
youth from great bodily exertion, only seemed to stimulate his mental
activity; and when in search of change of climate, with a view to
invigorated health, he undertook a voyage round the world, his
acquirements enabled him to keep a journal abounding in facts and
observations which, had his modesty not shrunk from appearing in
print, would have proved the record of a “Scientific Expedition.”
 During the voyage, his love of nature, and the wide range of his
scientific tastes acquired an increased stimulus; and when he returned
home his experience in observation, and his knowledge of natural
phenomena in different parts of the world, enabled him to enter with
renewed pleasure into the less active study of the physico-mathemati
cal sciences.                                         -
   He established an astronomical and meteorological observatory, and
in 1874 published a quarto volume on the “Meteorology of Halifax,”
which will continue to be a model for all such local observations.

                                    xxviii
Practical botany also engaged his attention, and his gardens
distinguished throughout the neighbourhood for the rich vari
their contents, especially in rare plants and exotics, of which
justly proud.
    His favourite studies were astronomy, geology, electricity, and
He took part in the early progress of photography, and in the dis
by the Rev. J. B. Reade, F.R.S., of the method of taking pc
first upon leather, and afterwards upon paper, instead of silver
or glass; and also with the chemical means of giving perman
such images.      He was an adept in working with the microscop
extremely fond of music, and a good player on the violoncello,
in practical applications few men could handle their tools bette
he, for in addition to his scientific acquirements he was a good m
cian, and many of his turnings in ivory were almost Chinese i
beauty and skilful execution.
    Those who knew him best can best appreciate the many-sid
tures of his genius, and will long remember the evenings spent :
 Head, where, although reticent in public, he would converse wi
 upon the most abstruse departments of mathematical or physi
 vestigation with an originality of illustration which showed
 was practically, as well as theoretically, acquainted both with th
 and principles of science. He interested himself actively in the
 of scientific knowledge, was an early supporter of the Halif
 chanics’ Institute, and delivered lectures to the local Litera
 Philosophical Society, of which he was one of the founders
 many years the President.      He also enriched the museum wit
 choice   objects of natural  history,  collected during his travel
 disposition was generous, and needy investigators were on man
 sions assisted by his bounty.    As a magistrate he was for man
 Chairman of the County Bench at Halifax, and a Deputy-Lie
 for the West Riding, whereby he proved himself a worthy des.
 of a family which for four hundred years had been intimatel
 ciated with the prosperity of the town and neighbourhood.
 years a stroke of paralysis, which compelled his retirement into
 life, only made him appreciate the more his beautiful garden
 a severe form of the malady prevented all mental occupatic
 finally terminated his life on the 13th February, 1879, in th
 year of his age.
     He was elected into the Royal Society in 1834, and was a
 of the Royal Astronomical, the Royal Microscopical, the Ge.
 and other Societies.
     ERNST   HENRICH   WEBER, the third      child of Michael Webe
 fessor of Positive Divinity at Wittenberg, was born on the
  June, 1795. He was a vigorous, cheerful boy, fond of active sp

                                     xxix
well as of study, and made rapid progress at the Fürstenschule at
Meissen, and in his sixteenth year left school to begin his studies at
the University of Wittenberg.         About this period he contracted a
friendship with the celebrated Chladni, who was a frequent guest at
his father's house, and this intimacy lasted as long as Chladni lived.
    Weber's studies at Wittenberg soon met with a serious interruption.
 The estates from which the University derived its revenue were laid
 waste in the campaign of 1813; then followed the siege of Witten
berg; and, at length, when in January, 1814, the town fell into the
 hands of the Prussians, the University itself was removed to Schmiede
berg for two years.        On this migration to Schmiedeberg, Weber
went to Leipzig, where he worked under the anatomist Rosenmüller,
 and through Chladni's introduction, was brought into scientific inter
 course with the physicist Gilbert.         He went rapidly through the
 various medical courses, and soon passed his examination in compara
tive anatomy. On the 6th of June 1815, he took the degree of M.D.
 at Schmiedeberg. Before he had completed his medical studies the fate
of the University of Wittenberg was decided with that of Saxony. On
its abolition, his father and five other Professors accepted a call to Halle;
 but Ernst Heinrich chose rather to go to Leipzig, which even then,
though only containing 25,000 inhabitants, ranked as one of the great
 cities of Germany.      Here he entered on medical practice as assistant
 to Professor   Clarus, without however giving up his favourite pursuits.
 He had    already,  in 1817, completed his “Anatomia Comparata Nervi
 Sympathici,” which he sent in as his inaugural dissertation.            The
explanatory plates to this work he himself engraved on copper. The
 publication of this book at once brought his name into prominence,
and he shortly afterwards received the offer of an Extraordinary Pro
fessorship    of Anatomy at Bonn; but a similar appointment being
 offered him at Leipzig, he chose the latter.
    In addition to the performance of the duties of the chair, he went
 on with his scientific investigations, amongst which was a research on
the organ of hearing of fishes—in the course of which he made several
 discoveries.    In 1821, on the death of Professor Rosenmüller, Weber
became Ordinary Professor of Human Anatomy at Leipzig.                 About
 this time he married the sister of his friend Schmiedt, and with her
 lived happily for upwards of fifty years. It was at this period that, in
 conjunction with his brother, Wilhelm Weber, he entered on the
 classical researches which led to the establishment of the celebrated
theory of waves. In company with his wife and his brother Wilhelm,
he made an excursion amongst the Alpine lakes in order to observe
 the motions of waves on a large scale. The observations made in this
journey led to his making a series of experiments in his father's house;
 and for four years Weber walked regularly every week to Halle and
back for the purpose of prosecuting this investigation. Among the most

                                      XXX.
remarkable experiments might be mentioned those on waves of water in
troughs, by means of which he found that the particles near the sur
face move in circular paths, while those deeper in the liquid describe
ellipses, the horizontal axes of which are longer than the vertical. By
another series of comparative observations on water and mercury,
the law was established that waves move with equal rapidity on the
surfaces of different mediums, while the rapidity increases in both
cases with the depth of the liquid.        These and a multitude of other
facts    have been of the utmost value in relation to the theory now
accepted    in explanation of the phenomena of light and sound.
    This   important   research was followed by other observations and
results published in various papers, as, for example, that entitled
“Ausdehnbarkeit und Elasticität der Haaré.” This latter led him to
the discovery of the so-called tension of organic substances. In the
paper “Ueber einige Einrichtungen der Wirbelsäule” (“On some
 Peculiarities in the Mechanism of the Vertebral Column”) he showed
how much the study of the structures of organs is aided by their being
observed during movements resembling those occurring in life, as well
 as when in a state of rest.
    In  1830 appeared   his edition of Hildebrandt's “Anatomie,” of which
 he wrote anew a considerable part.         In that work he examined care
 fully into the trustworthiness of the methods usually adopted in ana
 tomical investigation, especially the use of the microscope, at that time
 a very imperfect instrument.       As he carefully separated theories from
 established facts, he succeeded in arranging everything in its proper
 place, and showed the meaning of many experiments which his prede
 cessors had passed over    in silence.
    It was at the time of the appearance of the “Handbuch der Allge
 meinen Anatomie” that the political calm which had prevailed since
 the fall of Napoleon came to an end. About this time the Saxon
 Government took occasion to make considerable alterations in the con
 stitution of their Universities, but unluckily limited themselves to
 changes in the administration of the funds, overlooking the necessity
 for providing such means for the Professors as would admit of their
 giving themselves up entirely to their calling. The excitement caused
 by these changes in the old statutes was great, but happily only of
 short duration, for they were set aside by the events which led to a
 democratic constitution of the State. When the new constitution was
 established, and the Chambers again met in order to arrange the
 various details of the administration in accordance with the new prin
 ciples, the affairs of the University soon came under discussion.       The
 general feeling towards the institution was decidedly favourable, as was
 to be expected from the liberal tendency of the time, and most fortu
 nately for the University, it was represented in the Upper House by
 E. H. Weber. His views on University affairs were presented to the

                                            ...        xxxi

                                             a
more weight from the fact that, instead   pressing the urgent need   of                                            of
more space for his own department,          insisted specially he   measures                        on
of  more general usefulness, such                      as

                                                of
voted   tothe University 10,000 dollars,       addition     the sum origin
                                                                     in               to

                   Government.
   The city     Leipzig soon had reason for joining
                of                                          the approbation           in

in  conjunction with the medical faculty, introduced improvements into
the medical examinations.
  After the death              of   Kühn he undertook the regular discharge                                        of

  In  1850      he

                                                                                            of                     an
elaborate series     experiments, designed
                      of                                              to   study the wave movement
in   the arterial system, and explain the fact that the pulse-beat  felt                                      is

showed that the pulse-beat travels with     rapidity    about thirty-five
                                                                     a               of

results obtained by these experiments were published       the treatises                    in
“De Pulsu Arteriarum,” “De Utilitate Parietis Elastici Arteriarum,”
and, above all, that entitled “Die Anwendung der Wellenlehre auf
                      in
den Kreislauf des Blutes.”     These experiments gave      new direction                   a
to  the study    the subject
                     of          blood dynamics.

explained the difference between absorption       the veins and absorp     by

racemose glands end, and the relation between their alveoli and the
blood current.
   Weber also made       series of most careful observations on nerve
                                a
trunks, and published their results       series     treatises beginning
                                                             in  a              of
with that entitled “De Subtilitate    Tactus,”   and ending with “Die
Lehre vom Tastsinn und  Gemeingefühl     für Aerzte und Philosophen.”
He also published some interesting results          experiments       the   of                                on
mechanism     the ear,

on bringing together alcohol and resin suspended in water in capillary
spaces.    In 1851 appeared his book “Annotationes Anatomicae et
Physiologicae,” a work which contains accounts of his most valuable
investigations.
    Weber lived in intimate friendship with his two brothers—Wilhelm,
his fellow worker on the theory of waves, and a younger one, Edward,
who also settled in Leipzig.      He lived to the advanced age of 83, and
died on   January   the  26th, 1878, at Leipzig.
     E. H. Weber was    elected a foreign member of the     Royal Society in
1862.
     In BENNET WooDCROFT the Society loses a man who occupied          himself
 rather with the application of scientific principles to practical pur
 poses than with theoretical investigations.         He was born at Heaton
 Norris, Stockport, on the 29th of December, 1803, and in due time
 entered into partnership with his father, who carried on the business
 of a dyer and velvet finisher at Salford.        Previous to this he had ac
 quired a practical knowledge of the art of weaving, and had also
 studied chemistry under Dalton, of whom he became a favourite pupil.
 About 1843 he commenced business in Manchester as a consulting
 engineer, and shortly afterwards removed to London.          In April, 1847,
 he was   appointed   Professor of Machinery    at University  College, which
 post he held until July, 1851.      He was not a successful lecturer, for
 although his views were clear and decided, and he possessed the
 mechanical faculty in a high degree, he lacked the power of sustained
 exposition necessary to a successful lecturer.         Upon the passing of
 the Patent Law Amendment Act in 1852, Woodcroft was appointed
 by Lord Cranworth, then Lord Chancellor, to the post of Superin
 tendent of Specifications, a somewhat anomalous title which in no
 way indicated the responsible nature of the duties he was afterwards
 called upon to perform.       On the retirement of Mr. Edmunds, he be
 came, August 1st, 1864, Clerk of the Commissioners, which placed
 him in sole control of the department.          He retired from the public
 service March 31st, 1876, and his death occurred February 7, 1879, at
 his house in Redcliffe Gardens.
     In many   respects it would have    been difficult if not impossible to
 have found a better man to     place  at the head of the Patent Office than
 Mr. Woodcroft. Himself an inventor, he had an extensive acquaint
 ance with inventors; he knew their peculiar needs, and he possessed
 an intimate knowledge of the patent laws. His name will always be
 associated with the great work of printing and indexing the patent
  specifications—a series of records which present an unbroken view of
  the industrial progress of the nation for more than two hundred and
  fifty years. He displayed the keenest interest in all that related to
  inventions, and he spent much time in clearing up doubtful points in

                                       xxxiii
    the history of various arts, especially those of steam navigation
                                                                           and
    the manufacture of textile fabrics. The results are partly
                                                                  embodied in
    the “Sketch of the Origin and Progress of Steam Navigation” (1848),
    and “Brief Biographies of Inventors of Machines for the
                                                                 Manufacture
    of Textile Fabrics” (1863). Very little of the material collected during
    the later years of his life has, however, been given to the world. The
    peculiar bent of his mind showed itself also
                                                    in the formation of the
    Patent Office Museum, which was first opened to the public in June,
    1857.   The collection is small, but it embraces a number of machines
   and models of the highest historical interest, many of
                                                                which would
   have been destroyed or suffered to fall into decay but
                                                                     for Mr.
   Woodcroft. Forming part of the Museum, was a collection of por
   traits of inventors and authors of discoveries in connexion with the
   useful arts.    A considerable portion of his private fortune was
   expended in the purchase of portraits and objects
                                                           for the Museum,
  but partly in consequence of the want of a proper building, the
   Museum has not attained that importance which was hoped for by
                                                                           its
  founder.     The late Prince Consort took a warm interest in the
  scheme.
      Mr. Woodcroft's inventions       embraced subjects connected with
  weaving,    marine propulsion, and dyeing.      His “tappet” for looms,
  which was patented in 1838, is now in universal use in looms for
  weaving a certain class of goods. From
                                               an early period in his life he
  had paid great attention to the subject of marine propulsion,
                                                                      and in
  1832 he obtained a patent for his well-known increasing pitch
                                                                       screw
 propeller, which Lord Brougham, in the
                                              course of a judgment in the
  Committee of Privy Council, spoke of as “a very refined and
                                                                          in
 genious contrivance.”        In all the screws previously suggested the
 blade had a uniform pitch or incline, but Woodcroft's screw is
                                                                     formed
 by a blade so coiled round a shaft or cylinder that the angle of
 inclination of the worm with the axis continually decreases, and the
 pitch or distance between the coils continually increases throughout
 the whole length of the shaft upon which the spiral is formed. In
 consequence    of this elongation of pitch each successive part of the
 spiral begins to act before it is overtaken by the current given to the
water by the action of the preceding part, and consequently every
part meets with resistance from the water. In this way proportion
                                                               a
of propelling power is gained and loss from slip is avoided. He also
patented a “varying pitch” screw propeller, the object of which
was to enable the angle of the blades to be altered at pleasure,
                                                                    accord
ing to the varying circumstances of wind, currents, or tonnage. In
the course of his business as a dyer, he had been
                                                           struck with the
difficulty of printing calico with indigo, in consequence of the rapid
oxidation which takes place, and he made a series of experiments
                                                                          on

                                                                          of

tively in 1836 and 1846.   Although a considerable saving of indigo
was effected and much better work produced, the process was not a
commercial success.
