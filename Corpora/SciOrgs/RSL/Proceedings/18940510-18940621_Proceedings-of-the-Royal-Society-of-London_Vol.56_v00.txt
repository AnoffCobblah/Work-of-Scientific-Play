I. “The Composition of Atmospheres which Extinguish Flame.”
       By FRANK CLOWES, D.Sc., L0nd., Professor of Chemistry,
       University   College, Nottingham.       Communicated by Pro
       fessor ARMSTRONG,      F.R.S. Received March 14, 1894.
                          1. Introductory Remarks.
    A  study of the experiments which have been made to determine
the composition of atmospheres, which act extinctively upon <U+FB02>ame,
shows that in many cases the atmosphere under examination was in
contact with water. The solvent action of water on the carbon di~
oxide present seems in such cases likely to disturb the composition of
the mixture.      In other cases, only the perortion of oxygen in the
 extinctive atmosphere was noted, and the nature of the diluent gas or
gases was not taken into consideration.           Experiments were also
limited to the <U+FB02>ames of a few combustible substances, or where a
wider range of di<U+FB01>'erent <U+FB02>ames were tried, the results reported were
only of an approximate and relative nature.
    The experimental work, the results of which are summarized in
 this communication, was undertaken in order to supplement the
 de<U+FB01>ciencies referred to above, with the view of drawing further
 generalisations, and of furnishing support to those already drawn
 from previous experiments.
                       2.  Jlethod of Experimenting.
    The mixtures of air with the extinctive gas were made in a glass
  cylinder, which was closed by a ground glass plate.
     A measured quantity of water, equal in volume to the percentage
  of extinctive gas to be mixed with the air, was first poured into the
  glass cylinder.   The cylinder was then closed by the plate and in
  verted in a vessel of water. A light xylonite ball of known volume
  was then passed up, and the extinctive gas was introduced in su<U+FB02>icient
  quantity to <U+FB01>ll the cylinder.     The cylinder was then closed and its
  contents were mixed by the movement of the ball.
     In order to test the accuracy with which any desired mixture of
  gases could be prepared by this method, two mixtures of air with
  carbon dioxide were submitted to analysis. They furnished respec
  tively 9‘8 instead of 10 per cent, and 697 instead of 70 per cent. of
  carbon dioxide.
     The experimental <U+FB02>ames used were 0'75 in. in height and were
  gradually lowered into the cylinder, the top of which was <U+FB01>nally
  covered by the plate. The gases were burnt from a platinum jet
  1 mm.   in diameter.

1894.]             Atmospheres which extinguish Flame.                         3
    The gaseous mixture was considered to be in extinctive proportions
if the  <U+FB02>ame was extinguished during its downward passage, or imme
diately upon attaining its lowest position in the cylinder.                 The
mixture was considered to contain the minimum necessary quantity of
extinctive gas, when another mixture containing 1 per cent. less of
the extinctive gas allowed the <U+FB02>ame to continue burning in it for a
few seconds only.
    The limiting differences between the results of repeated trials
corresponded to 1 per cent. of the extinctive gas in the air.
    This minimum necessary percentage of extinctive gas is recorded
below in tabulated form.
    It was considered necessary to take the immediate extinction of the
<U+FB02>ame as the criterion of extinctive power, since the composition
of the atmosphere was rapidly affected by the combustion of the
<U+FB02>ame.
                      3. In<U+FB02>uence  of the  Size of the Flame.
    As a matter of convenience, the <U+FB02>ames were, in all cases, set to a
height of 0'75 inch. But a series of experiments was undertaken
 with the same <U+FB02>ame of varying size, in order to ascertain if the pro
portion of extinctive gas necessary to extinguish the <U+FB02>ame varied with
 the size of the <U+FB02>ame.
    The results of these experiments with <U+FB02>ames of hydrogen and
 alcohol, varying from 0'4: in. to 1'5 in. in height, show that the vary
 ing dimensions of the <U+FB02>ame, within the wide limits included in the
 trials, are without in<U+FB02>uence on the proportion of carbon dioxide in the
 air necessary to produce extinction.
                    4. Method of Preparation of Gases Used.
     The carbon dioxide employed for the experiments was prepared in
 the usual way by the action of diluted hydrochloric acid upon marble.
 It was washed with water, and was proved to be practically free
 from air.
     The nitrogen was prepared by heating an aqueous solution contain
 ing potassium nitrite, ammonium chloride,         and potassium dichromate.
 An analysis of     the resulting   gas proved that      it contained  99'7 per
 cent. of nitrogen.

    Characteristic differences were observed between the behaviour of
wick-fed <U+FB02>ames and that of gas-fed <U+FB02>ames when they were introduced
into an atmosphere which extinguished them. The wick-fed <U+FB02>ames
gradually diminished in size until they vanished. The gas-fed <U+FB02>ames,
on the other hand, gradually increased in size, becoming pale and
apparently lower in temperature, and then suddenly expired. The
extinction of the <U+FB02>ame is apparently due in both cases to the lower
ing of its temperature. This primary cause, however, seems to
operate directly in the case of the gas-fed <U+FB02>ame, whilst in the case of
the wick-fed <U+FB02>ame it operates by gradually reducing the amount of
combustible gas and vapour produced, and leads ultimately to the
<U+FB02>ame dying from lack of combustible material. The large expansion
of the gas-fed <U+FB02>ame is evidently due to an attempt to obtain the
necessary supply of oxygen in the diluted atmosphere by increasing
its own surface.
                         6.  Theoretical Considerations.
    The following deductions seem to be warranted             by the results
 arrived at in these experiments :—
    1.   That   the extinction   of a <U+FB02>ame is not determined only by the
          proportion  which   the inert gas bears to the oxygen of the atmo
          sphere into which it is introduced, but that the nature of. the
          inert gas present also in<U+FB02>uences the result.
    NJ . That carbon dioxide uniformly       exerts a more powerful extinc
          tive elfect upon <U+FB02>ame than nitrogen does.
    3. That there is a remarkable uniformity in the proportions of
           inert gas which must be mingled with air in order to just
           extinguish wick-fed <U+FB02>ames.
    4. That this uniformity does not apply to the <U+FB02>ames of coma
           bustible gases burnt from a jet.
    Ur. That the <U+FB02>ames        of gases burnt from a jet show no simple
           relation, as regards the proportion of oxygen present in the
           extinctive atmosphere, to the relative pmportions of oxygen
           required for their complete combustion.
     With regard to the superior extinctive power of carbon dioxide
 over that of nitrogen, it has been stated that the greater the density
 of an inert gas which is introduced into air, the less will be the
 quantity which suf<U+FB01>ces to arrest combustion. Waldie suggests that
  this is due to the cooling effect produced upon the <U+FB02>ame by the
  rapidity of di<U+FB01>usion of its heated products increasing as the sur
  rounding atmosphere increases in density. But it is probable that
  carbon dioxide also surpasses nitrogen in its extinctive effect upon
  <U+FB02>ame in virtue of its higher speci<U+FB01>c heat, and because of its slower
  movement owing to its high molecular weight and density.             When

 6     Composition   of Atmospheres which extinguish Flame. {May        10,
 the heavy gas is mingled with the air, it adds to the density of the
 mixture, and renders the atmosphere more sluggish in its movement
towards the <U+FB02>ame to supply the necessary oxygen.
    It had been anticipated that in the presence of the hydrogen
<U+FB02>ame, and possibly of other <U+FB02>ames, carbon dioxide would have
su<U+FB01>ered partial deoxidation, as it is well known to do in the presence
of burning magnesium vapour. No such action appeared to occur,
else the above relation between the extinctive powers of carbon
dioxide and nitrogen could not well exist.
    The cause of the comparative uniformity of the proportion of
extinctive gas required for wick-fed <U+FB02>ames has been already hinted
at.    The <U+FB02>ames are starved of combustible nutriment by the lowering
of the temperature of the <U+FB02>ame.        This cause seems to operate with
strikingly similar results upon the di<U+FB02>fereut solid and liquid com
bustibles.
    The cause of the want of conformity to theoretical considerations
in the case of the gaseous <U+FB02>ames fed from jets is not at once
apparent.
    It is of practical interest to note that the introduction of a mini
mum of 15 per cent. of carbon dioxide into air is necessary to cause
it to extinguish ordinary wick-fed <U+FB02>ames, the oxygen being reduced
by this admixture from the normal proportion of 21 per cent. to 18 per
cent.    For the extinction of a coal-gas <U+FB02>ame, however, the'addition of
33 per cent. of carbon dioxide is necessary, and the oxygen being
thus reduced to 14 per cent.        The hydrogen <U+FB02>ame has far greater
vitality, requiring the admixture of 58 per cent. of carbon dioxide
with air, and the consequent reduction of the oxygen to 8'8 per cent,
before it su<U+FB01>ers extinction.     This fact is of great importance, since it
shows that the hydrogen <U+FB02>ame in the composite miner’s safety lamp
 (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 52, p. 486) may be used as an auxiliary to
prevent the loss of <U+FB02>ame when the lamp is being carried through
mine-air containing large proportions of carbon dioxide.
    I  have to thank one of my senior students, Martin E. Feilmann,
13.80., for conducting much of the experimental work involved in this
research.
     [April  28th,   1894.—Recent experiments seem to prove that a
rabbit can breathe with impunity, for at least an hour, air containing
 25 per cent. of admixed carbon dioxide (J . R. Wilson, ‘American
 Journal of Pharmacy,’ 50, No. 12). If this is the case, the extinction
 of an ordinary <U+FB02>ame does not prove the surrounding atmosphere to
 be irrespirable.     The introduction of 15 per cent. of this gas ex
 tinguishes a <U+FB02>ame, whilst the air seems to be still respirable, even
 after it has been mingled with an additional 10 per cent. of carbon
 dioxide—F.     (3.]

      Prismatic Camera during the Total Eclipse of the 181111,
      April 16, 1893.” By J. NORMAN LOGKYER, C.B., F.R.S.
      Received February 22, 1894.
                               (Abstract)
   During    the total eclipse of 1871 observations were made by
Respighi   and  the author with a spectroscope deprived of its colli
mator, and a series of rings was seen corresponding to the different
rays emitted by the corona and prominences.     A similar instrument,
arranged for photography, was employed during several succeeding
eclipses, but the photographs were on so small a scale that none of
the results came up to the expectations raised by the observations of
1871.    As the Solar Physics Committee is now in possession of a
prismatic camera of 6 inches aperture, the prism having a rcfracting
angle of 45°, it was determined to employ it during the eclipse of
1893.    The instrument was placed at the disposal of the Eclipse
Committee by the Solar Physics Committee, and was entrusted to
Mr. Fowler, who took the photographs at the African station.
   It also seemed desirable that a series of similar photographs
should be taken at another point on the line of totality, even though
an equally ef<U+FB01>cient instrument were not available.     A spectroscope
with two 3-inch prisms of 60°, used in conjunction with a siderostat,
accordingly formed part of the equipment of the expedition to Brazil,
and was placed in charge of Mr. Shackleton.
   The present preliminary report is intended to indicate the kind of
results obtained, and some of the photographs are reproduced for the
information of those specially interested, as it will be some time
before the complete reductions are ready for publication.
   At the African station 30 plates were exposed, 15 during totality,
and the remainder in the <U+FB01>ve minutes before and after totality.       In
Brazil 17 plates were exposed during totality, and 7 out of totality.
   The most conspicuous lines, or rather portions of circles, seen in
the photographs taken during totality, are the H and K lines of
calcium, and in these rays the images of the various prominences are
very clearly outlined.
   The lines of hydrogen, extending far into the ultra violet, are also
very prominent, and numerous other lines are seen in addition.
   Isochromatic plates were used for some of the exposures, and on
some of these the ring formed by the characteristic line of the coronal
spectrum (14174 K) is clearly depicted, especially in the Brazilian
photographs. A comparison with the photographic records of the
corona shows that the prismatic camera has picked out the brightest

      munication.”      By WILLIAM MACNAB, F.I.C., F.C.S., and E.
      RISTORI, Ass. M. Inst. C.E., F.R.A.S.         Communicated by
      Professor RAMSAY, F.R.S.        Received February      28. 1894.
    During the last two years we have carried out a long series of ex
periments    with explosive compounds for the purpose of studying
chemical reactions at high temperatures and pressures, and of eluci
 dating certain thermal constants relating chie<U+FB02>y to the speci<U+FB01>c heat
of gases under such conditions.
    For these experiments we have principally used nitro-glycerin,
nitro-cellulose, and several combinations of these two bodies which
are used as smokeless gunpowders, for the reason that such modern
explosives offer the advantage of not only presenting comparatively
simple chemical reactions, owing to the absence of solid residue, but
also of enabling considerable variations to be made in their composition
so as to vary the proportions of the elements reacting.
    We also expected that the results which we obtained would make
 a small contribution to the knowledge of explosives          in general.
following up the lines indicated by the published work of Noble and
 Abel, Berthelot, Sarrau, Vieille, and others.
    In this preliminary communication we propose chie<U+FB02>y to indicate
 the results obtained in the measurement of the heat evolved by ex
 plosion, and of the quantity and composition of the gases produced by
 this metamorphosis.
    We have also made considerable progress towards the determina
 tion of the actual temperature of explosion, and we have succeeded in
 recording these high temperatures by photographic means, but, as
 this work is not yet completed, we shall not further refer to it in
 this paper, but we hope it will make the subject of another commu
 nication at an early date.
    These modern eprOsives, and especially the smokeless powders,
 have assumed of late such importance that it may be of general inte
 rest to give here a brief sketch of their development.
   _About thirty years ago experiments were made in Austria with the

object of using gun-cotton for the charges of ri<U+FB02>e ammunition, but no
success was obtained, and the matter dropped.
    Other explosives, consisting principally of nitro-lignin or nitro
 cellulose, not gelatinised,and mixed with nitrates or other substances,
were afterwards invented and adopted for sporting guns successfully,
and have been largely sold in the market under different well-known
names.       These explosives, however, were not found suitable for the
                                                  '
charges     of ri<U+FB02>es and guns.
    Further development in the science of artillery, and a better know
ledge of the action of explosives, encouraged further researches for
the production of new propelling agents for ri<U+FB02>es and guns, and
these researches have been so far successful that in a few years
several new powders have been produced, each one of which is far
superior to black gunpowder.
    The new explosives now in use contain nitro-cellulose as one of
their principal elements; some of them contain also nitro-glycerin
in more or less proportion; the nitro-cellulose, by solution in nitro
glycerin, acetone, or other suitable solvent, is gelatinised, and by
mechanical means the explosive compound is compressed and squirted
into cords, or rolled into sheets, and then cut into strips or grains
of suitable size for the different <U+FB01>rearms.
    The great secret of all these modern explosives seems to be that by
the above means they are made into a solid substance, thus avoiding
any porosity, and it appears probable that by doing so even the most
powerful explosive can be mastered, so that, burning regularly from
 the surface, the rate of combustion can be controlled so as to avoid
                                                         '
detonation.
    This constitutes the most striking feature of the modern smokeless
gunpowders, especially of those containing nitro-glycerin.        If cer
tain sized cubes, strips or cords of such powders are <U+FB01>red in a- certain
gun, and the length of this gun does not allow of suf<U+FB01>cient time
during the travel of the shot, for the explosive to be entirely con
sumed, the unburnt residue of the charge will be found to be of the
same shape, whether cubes, strips or cords, only reduced in size;
 thus proving the most perfect surface combustion of these explosives.
    It. is thus possible to determine accurately what quantity of explo
sive, and what surface of combustion for the same, will be required,
in order to obtain certain results in a certain gun, thus avoiding
 waste of powder.
    This property of modern smokeless powder was illustrated on the
occasion of a disastrous <U+FB01>re which occurred in May, 1890, at the
factory of Avigliana, Italy, where large quantities of the explosive
called ballistite were manufactured for the Government.          In one
 building twelve tons of this explosive were collected, and various
operations of manufacture wereperformed.         By accident some of it

took <U+FB01>re, and the whole quantity was burnt in a. few seconds.
Though this powder was made of such powerful explosives as
nitro-glycerin and nitro-cellulose, and though the amount was so
large that, had it been black powder, it would have caused destruc
tion for many miles around, still there was no explosion of any kind ;
none of the machinery was in any way damaged, and the wood was
barely charred.
   The explosives used in these experiments can be divided into three
classes   :—
    1. Those consisting of nitro-lignin or nitro-cellulose (not gelati
nised), mixed, or impregnated with a suitable nitrate, and mixed with
colouring matters and some other substances for the purpose of re
tarding the rate of combustion. We have taken as samples of this
class the EC and the SS powders now commonly used in sporting
guns (the EC consisting principally of nitro-cellulose mixed with
barium nitrate and a small proportion of camphor, the SS powder
consisting of nitro-lignin mixed with barium nitrate and nitro-ben
zene).
   2. Those consisting of puri<U+FB01>ed nitro-lignin or nitro-cellulose gela
tinised by a suitable process, and with or without the addition of
nitro-benzene or other suitable nitrates.
    As sample of this class we have taken the BN powder manufac
tured by the French Government, and also the Ri<U+FB02>eite and the
Troisdorf powder, which are now commonly used for small arms
ammunition.       (The BN consists mainly of gelatinised nitro-cellulose;
the Troisdorf also consists of gelatinised nitro-cellulose,         but is
coated with graphite.      Ri<U+FB02>eite is also made with gelatinised nitro
cellulose, with the addition, however, of a certain proportion of nitro
benzene).
    3. Those consisting of nitro-cellulose combined with nitro-glycerin,
 with  the addition of aniline, camphor, vaseline,   or other kindred sub~
 stances.    To this class belong cordite and ballistite.
    Cordite contains 58 per cent. of nitro-glycerin, 37 per cent. of
 gun-cotton, and 5 per cent. of vaseline.
    Ballistite of Italian manufacture contains equal parts of nitro
 cellulose and nitro-glycerin, with the addition of 1% per cent. of
 aniline.
    Ballistite of German manufacture contains a slightly higher per
 centage of nitro-cellulose, and is coated with graphite.
    Besides, for the purpose of these experiments, a series of samples
 of ballistite were specially made containing nitro-glycerin and
 nitro-cellulose in various proportions.
    The experiments were carried out in two closed vessels of diiferent
 dimensions and construction—a large one capable of standing high
 pressures, and a small one for calorimetric work.

      The large one consists of a steel cylinder of great thickness, closed at
   both ends by conical screw-plugs. One plug is provided with a crusher
   gauge of the well-known pattern by which the compression of a small
   cylinder of copper serves to measure the pressure developed.           The
   other plug  is provided  with   an  insulated  conical  core, by means   of
   which an electric current can be passed for the purpose of <U+FB01>ring the
  charge.     A small hole on the side of the cylinder, bushed with
  iridium.platinum, and closed by a coned screw-plug, serves to control
  the escape of the gases produced by the explosion.
      The capacity of the chamber was carefully measured, and was
  found to be 247'6 0.0.
     The small vessel is of the same pattern as used by Berthelot, and
  was made by Golaz, of Paris.        It has given great satisfaction, and is
  in excellent order, although it has been used for more than two
. hundred explosions.
     This bomb, which is made of mild steel and is cylindrical in shape,
  consists essentially of three parts—a. bowl, a conical lid which is
  accurately ground into the bowl, and a tightening cap which screws
  on to the bowl over the lid.
     There is a small hole in the lid provided with a delivery tube,
  which can be Opened and closed by means of a<U+FB01>nely-threaded conical
  plug. There is also an insulated platinum cone inserted from under
  neath in the lid, which admits of the charge in the bomb being <U+FB01>red
  by a platinum wire heated to redness by electricity.
     From the lid depend platinum supports which carry a. platinum
  capsule, in which the explosive is placed and suspended in the middle
  of the chamber.
     The capacity of this bomb is 488 0.0., and the total weight, includ
  ing a small stand, when ready for immersion in the calorimeter, is
  563328 grams.                                                       .
     The calorimeter is made of thin sheet brass, and a helicoidal
  stirrer of the same metal (Berthelot’s pattern), driven by a small
  electromotor during the experiment, serves to thoroughly mix the
  water.
     The calorimeter stood in the centre of an annular water-jacket
  covered with felt. The quantity of water used in the calorimeter
   each time was 2,500 grams, and the equivalent in water of the bomb,
  stirrer, and calorimeter, due allowance having been made for the
  different speci<U+FB01>c heats of the di<U+FB01>erent metals, is 6234 grams.
     The diiferent thermometers employed were specially made by
  Casella, capable of being read to 0005 of a degree'centigrade, and
  the weights of their stems, bulbs, and mercury were known.
     Various experiments were made in the large vessel, especially for
  the purpose of determining the pressure of the gases under different
  densities of charge.

    These trials were carried out in a <U+FB01>eld, the bomb being lowered
into a hole in the ground before <U+FB01>ring.
    Various dif<U+FB01>culties were encountered, and in one experiment con
siderable damage was done by the heated gases c<U+FB01>ecting their escape

at the moment of explosion, and “washing away part of the thread
of one of the screw plugs.
    With a density of loading of A = 0'1, i.e., with a. charge of 24'76
grams, the average of the pressures measured was 6'3 tons per square
inch; with density A = 0'2 the pressure rose to 15 tons, and with
A = 0'3 the pressure increased to 25 tons. These results are very         >
similar to those published by Sir A. Noble, F.R.S.
    With the small bomb were ascertained the amount of heat gene
rated by the explosion, the volume and composition of the permanent
gases resulting, and the quantity of aqueous vapour produced.
    As most of the explosives contained no mineral matter beyond a
tri<U+FB02>ing percentage of “ ash,” it has been possible to analyse them in
this way, the products of explosion when calculated from the analysis
and volume of permanent gas and aqueous vapour agreeing closely
 with the weight of matter in the bomb before <U+FB01>ring.
    A few of the explosives left a carbonaceous or mineral residue;
 but these will be specially noticed further on in connexion with the
 tables of the results.
     The heat evolved was measured by placing the bomb containing
 the charge of explosive in the calorimeter containing 2500 grams of
 water, and it was arranged that the temperature of the air, the water
 jacket, and the calorimeter closely approximated each other. The
 stirrer was set in motion, and the thermometer in the calorimeter
 was read with a kathetometer.        Observations of the temperature
 were made every minute for the <U+FB01>ve minutes preceding the <U+FB01>ring of
 the charge, and continued at intervals of a minute until the maximum
 was reached, and for <U+FB01>ve minutes longer.      The correction for loss of
  heat  due to  radiation of  heat during the experiments amounted in
  general to about 0'01 of a degree. The increase in temperature varied
  from about 1° to 2? C. according to the charge and explosive
 used.
     The gas generated    by the explosion was passed through weighed
 drying tubes connected with the valve on the lid of the vessel, and
 then collected and measured in a calibrated glass cylinder over
 mercury.     The reading of the barometer and thermometer was noted,
  and the volume reduced to 0° C. and 760 mm.
     The water was determined by immersing the bomb in a vessel
 containing boiling water.      A three-way. glass stop-cock intervened
 between the valve of the bomb and the drying tubes, and the other
 end of the drying apparatus was connected with a water vacuum
 pump.

      The other branch of the three-way tap was connected with a
   separate drying apparatus. When the water surrounding the bomb
   was boiling, by starting the vacuum pump the steam and water were
   drawn into the absorbing apparatus; after a good vacuum had been
   made in the bomb the three-way tap was turned so that dry air
  rushed in. then connexion was made with the drying apparatus, the
   bomb again exhausted, and so on, alternately, until (as experience
   showed) all the water had been removed from the bomb and collected
  in the drying tubes, which were then weighed. The weights of water
  thus obtained were calculated for comparison into volumes of H20
  gas at 0° C. and 760 mm.
     The analyses of gas were carried out in duplicate in Dittmar’s
  apparatus as improved by Lennox.
     In most of the experiments the bomb, previous to <U+FB01>ring, was ex
  hausted, and the amount of residual pressure, varying from 24 to
  40 mm., noted on closing it.             The amount of air corresponding to
  these pressures      left  in  the  bomb has the effect of increasing the heat
  generated by      a   small    quantity amounting to 5 to 7 calories. This
  quantity being within the limits of error of the calorimetric observa
'
  tion no correction was made for the same, but the quantity of
  residual air was taken into account when comparing the weights of
  the products found with the weight of the explosive used.               Thus in
  Tables   I  and     II  the   volumes of gas of the given composition and
  of aqueous vapour were obtained from the given weight of ex
  plosive increased by the weight of the air corresponding to the
  vacuum indicated.
     When <U+FB01>ring in an exhausted bomb it was found necessary to have
  the explosive surrounding the <U+FB01>ring wire in comparatively small
  pieces in order to ensure ignition of the whole charge.
     Table   I gives the principal results obtained with the several
  gunpowders above mentioned, Tables                II  and III   give the results

  tary composition of several explosives compared with the products of

     With the exception of the results given in Table IV, all the others

 last three <U+FB01>gures being suppressed in order to simplify the results.
     In the case of EC and SS a certain amount of mineral residue
 was left, but this was not determined.
     Troisdorf leaves a slight, and Ri<U+FB02>eite and EN a considerable,
 carbonaceous residue, part of it adhering so tenacioust to the bomb
  that an exact determination was not made.
     In the other experiments recorded in Tables and                     I      II  the degree of
 accuracy       of  the      results    may be gauged by           the    fact that  the average
 weight of the products of explosion, calculated from the results found,
 amounts to 99'? per cent. of the weight of the explosive <U+FB01>red, the
extreme limits being 1005 and 989 per cent.
     In Table       II   the comparison of the pairs of results from explosives
 made with lower and more highly nitrated nitro-cellulose shows that
the use of the highly nitrated cellulose increases the quantity of
heat developed, and diminishes the volume of gas. The composition

 being an increase in carbonic acid and decrease in carbonic oxide
 and hydrogen.
     The similarity in the volumes of gas produced and the composition
 of the permanent gases in the case of experiments F and G is worthy
 of note when the great difference in the original component ingre
 dients of the explosives is borne in mind.
     Table   III  shows clearly the increase of heat due to increased per
 centage of nitro-glycerin, as well as the di<U+FB01>erence of heat evolved
 from explosives containing nitro-cellulose of di<U+FB01>erent degrees of
 nitration.
     The diminution in quantity of heat (about 200 calories) which the
replacement of 5 per cent. of nitro-c'ellulose by vaseline makes is also
very striking.

   These are some of the principal features noticeable in a. preliminary
survey of these experiments.     We are continuing our investigations
on the lines indicated in the paper, and are especially endeavouring
to measure the actual temperature of explosion under varying con
ditions, and it is hoped that the results obtained will throw some
light on the chemical and physical properties of many gases at high
temperatures and under considerable pressures, and, at the same
time, be useful in the practical application of explosives.

                                   (Abstract)
   On August      1893, at 6.41 P.M., an earthquake of intensity nearly
                    4!,
equal to    6 (according to the Rossi-Forel scale) was felt over the
whole of Leicestershire and Rutland and in parts of all the adjoining
counties. The disturbed area was 58 miles long, 46 miles broad, and
contained an area of about 2066 square miles.        The direction of the
longer axis  (about  W. 40°  N.  and E. 40°  S.) and the relative position
of the isoseismal lines  show   that the  originating fault,    the earth
                                                                      if
quake were due to fault-slipping, must run in about the direction indi
cated, passing between Woodhouse Eaves and Mark<U+FB01>eld, and heading
                                                                           0   2

 towards the north-east. The anticlinal fault of Charnwood Forest,
 so far as known, satis<U+FB01>es these conditions, and it is highly probable
 that the earthquake was caused by a slip of this fault.
    The beginning of the sound preceded that of the shock in all parts of
 the disturbed area; the end of the sound followed that of the shock in
 the central district and in the neighbourhood of the minor axis, but
 preceded it near the end of the major axis.        Thus the sound ap
 parently outraced the shock in the direction of the major axis, but
 not in that of the minor axis. These time-relations of the sound and
 shock can be readily explained if the area over which the fault-slip
took place were several miles in length, for the sound in all prob
 ability is due to small and rapid vibrations proceeding chie<U+FB02>y from
the margins of that area.
    The intensity was greatest at and near Woodhouse Eaves, and it is
probable that the fault-slip began in the neighbourhood of this
place, gradually diminishing in amount in either direction, rather
rapidly towards the north-west, and much more slowly towards the
south-east ; the rate at which the slipping advanced being greater than
the velocity of the earth-wave. The total length of the fault-slip may
have been as much as 12 miles or even more, and there can be little
doubt that it was continued for some distance under the Triassic
 rocks on which Leicester is built.
 V.   “The Total Solar Eclipse of        16th April, 1893.    Report on
       Results obtained with the Slit Spectroscopes.”          By E. H.
       HILLS, Capt. RE.        Communicated by the          Joint Solar
       Eclipse Committee. Received March 7, 1894.
    The parties 'in Brazil and Africa were both supplied with these
instruments, two being sent to each station.       The instruments were
arranged to take one photograph only during the eclipse with an
exposure as long as possible.     It was considered that the amount of
light available would not allow of more than one successful exposure
 being made.     Of the four resulting photographs, one of those taken
in Brazil was unfortunately not <U+FB01>nished before the sun reappeared,
whilst the other shows a faint corona spectrum with a strong sky
spectrum on both sides, and a considerable amount of general fog
over the plate.
    I have been able to detect nothing of interest in this photograph,
for the Fraunhofer lines overlap the corona spectrum to such a
degree that it is impossible to distinguish any bright lines with
certainty.
    The instrument employed in Africa consisted of two spectroscopes,
on one equatorial mounting.      The <U+FB01>rst spectroscope had two prisms,

1894.]           The Total Solar Eclipse   of 16th April, 1893.          21
each 1'75 in: height and      25 in. in base, with refracting angles of 62°,
and the second spectroscope         had one prism'2‘6 in. both in height
and base.
  Condensing lenses, 3'5 in. aperture and 17'5 in. focus, and of 3 in.
aperture and 1405 in. focus, were used with the two instruments re
spectively.
  Both spectroscopes were <U+FB01>xed on stout mahogany base-boards, and
were completely adjusted before leaving England.
  To attach them to the mounting, a mahogany tube, about 6 in.
square and 2 ft. long, was bolted to the top of the declination axis,
and the base-boards of the spectroscopes were screwed on either side
of it.
   A small telescope of      212-
                              in. aperture was attached on the other_side
of the tube to act as a <U+FB01>nder and for purposes of adjustment.         The
mounting was one that was made for the eclipse of 1886. It con_
sisted of    tripod stand composed of pieces of angle iron with the
             a
polar  and  declination  axes, and circles of the Corbett equatorial.    It
was found to be easy to set up and rigid.
    On arrival at Fundium, a site was selected, and         concrete base
                                                            a
was formed. On this the instrument was set up, and no trouble was
experienced in getting       it into adjustment.    The slits of the two
spectroscopes   were   placed  parallel to each  other and tangential to  a
circle of declination,  and  were adjusted so that they cut across oppo
site limbs of the sun, that of the two-prism spectroscope being
across the upper or western limb, and that of the one-prism spectro
scope across the eastern limb.       For several days before the eclipse,
trial plates were taken, in order to obtain reference spectra, and for
getting the focus as perfect as possible, as well as for the sake of
practising the development of the plates.
   The plates used were Cadett’s most rapid make, and various de
velopers were tried, but no special peculiarities of behaviour were
noticed pyrogallic acid was used for the eclipse plates. Before leaving
         ;
England the plates were backed with a solution of asphalt in benzole,
for the purpose of destroying the halation or re<U+FB02>ection from the back
surface of the glass.
   At the eclipse the shutters of the two cameras were opened about
ten seconds after the commencement of totality, and closed about ten
seconds before the end, giving a total exposure of three minutes
<U+FB01>fty seconds. During the progress of the eclipse          I  observed the
corona and the upper or western limb of the sun through the small
telescope with a magnifying power of 410. The corona in this region
showed very faint radial markings and several rosy-pink prominences
were seen. The largest of these was one at the W. N. W. limb, which
is the one of which a strong spectrum was obtained with the two
 prism spectroscope.     The plates were developed the same evening on
                                                                  \

 board the “Alecto.”       The resulting photograph in the case of the
 two-prism speetroscope shows a prominence spectrum on both sides
of the dark body of the moon, and outside these a corona spectrum
with a faint solar (dark line) spectrum on its extreme edge. The
 H, K and some other lines extend over the dark moon and on both
sides beyond the limits of the corona spectrum.         That of the one
prism spectroscope shows the same general character, but there is a
prominence spectrum on one side only. Both these photographs were
over-exposed, better results would have been obtained if two or even
three exposures had been made in the same time.
                      Measurement   of the Photographs.
    The following is the method of measurement adopted.          A very
accurate   micrometer by Hilger, reading to 0001 mm., was employed
throughout.
    The large number of bright lines in the prominence spectrum
rendered the use of the reference spectra unnecessary.
    The hydrogen series, together with the lines at wave-lengths 4215'3,
4471'2, and the b group gave a suf<U+FB01>cient number of <U+FB01>xed points through
which to draw an interpolation curve. The micrometer readings of
these lines having been taken with the greatest possible accuracy, an
interpolation curve was constructed on a large scale, two curves being
drawn for each photograph as a check on each other. The micro
meter readings of the remaining prominence lines were then deter
mined and their wave-lengths taken from the curves.
    The micrometer readings of the corona lines were next taken. It
was impossible to get both sides of the photograph in the <U+FB01>eld of the
microscope at the same time, so each side was taken separately, thus
getting four series of scale-readings representing possible coronal
lines.
    The wave-lengths corresponding to these scale-readings were then
determined from the interpolation curves, and lists were made—<U+FB01>rst,
of lines common to both photographs; second, of lines occurring on
both sides of one photograph ; third, of lines which had been ob
served in previous eclipses.
    New measurements of the photographs were again made, with the
 same care as the <U+FB01>rst, and all lines in the lists were struck out which
 were not plainly visible in this second scrutiny.
    It is possible that this <U+FB01>nal list may contain some wave-lengths of
 lines due to accidental marks; this must be rare, however, as any
mark so treated must have been parallel to the lines.
    A comparison of the measurements of the two photographs will
 give a good idea of the limits of accuracy of these results.

                          The Prominence     Spectrum.
    This list gives the wave-lengths of all the lines in one prominence
from each photograph. The second prominence on the two-prism
spectroscope plate is of a similar character to the one given, but
contains fewer lines.
    The intensities of the lines are given approximately by the numbers
from 1 to 6.
    The most interesting feature of this spectrum is the extended
hydrogen series.      There seems no reason to doubt that the lines at
wave-lengths      3692'5,   3687, 3682, 3678, 3675, 3672, 36695, and
3667 are members      of  it.
    M. Deslandres has obtained a photograph showing <U+FB01>ve hydrogen
lines beyond the one at wave-length 3699 ; this photograph carries the
series three lines further.         The line at 3680 is the iron line, whose
wave-length    is given   by    Cornu  as 36803, and by Hartley as 36795.
The new      notation  for    the  hydrogen series has been used as con
 venient. H13 is F, Hry the line near G, and so on, consecutively.
                               The Corona Spectrum.
    This is the <U+FB01>nal adopted list, as described above. It is almost
 impossible to estimate the intensity of these feeble lines by eye, so
 no attempt has been made to do so ; but in the column headed
 “intensity” is placed the number of occurrences of the line in the
 two photographs, the maximum number being four, viz., on each
 side of both photographs.
    Opposite each line in the table is placed the corresponding line that
 has been noted in previous eclipses.        For a complete list of the ob
 served corona spectrum,        see Dr.  Schuster’s report on the eclipse of
 1886 (‘ Phil. Trans,’ vol. 180 A, p. 335).
    It will be observed that the 1474: K, or so-called corona line, is
 placed in the prominence and not in the corona spectrum.                 This
 line is shown very faintly on the extreme limit of one photograph, in
 which it certainly appears to belong to the prominence.            It is true
 that it extends into the corona, but at the same time it also extends
 in the opposite direction, over the dark body of the moon. Its appear
 ance is somewhat similar to that of the strong hydrogen lines, whose
  apparent extension into the corona spectrum is probably due to atmo
                                              -
  spheric haze.
     This region of the spectrum      has  never been specially photographedv
  with the slit spectroscope during an eclipse, and        I   think a serious.
  attack on it should most certainly be made at the <U+FB01>rst opportunity, by
                                                                                ‘

  to this region of the spectrum.

        Fellow of King’s College, Cambridge, Superintendent of

                                             (Abstract)
    If a. system of bodily forces whose values per unit mass are derived
 from the potential

  1894.]      Forces derivable from a Potential     of the Second Degree.    27
  whose density p is uniform, the statical resultant reduces to a couple
  whose components about the axes of w, y, z are respectively
  4wabc (bz—cz) pS/15,        4wabc (cg—a”) pT/l5,    and Maxim (oz—b”) pU/15.
      These    components vanish in the case of a sphere, but in an
  ordinary ellipsoid equilibrium will not exist unless S, T, U all
                                  ‘
  vanish.
      The problem solved in the present memoir, viz., that of an isotropic
  elastic solid ellipsoid under the action of bodily forces derived from a
  potential
                                 % (Pw2+ (2112+ Rzz).
  is thus, for    an ordinary ellipsoid, the most general case of equilibrium
  under forces derived from a potential of the second degree. The above
  potential covers forces arising from mutual gravitation or from rota
  tion about a principal axis in an ellipsoid of any shape.
      The method of solution reverses the usual order of procedure, the
  stresses being <U+FB01>rst determined and then the strains and displace
  ments. The solution obtained satis<U+FB01>es without limitation or assump
  tion of any kind all the elastic solid equations.           Unless the ratios
  a : b : c are assigned de<U+FB01>nite numerical values, the constant coef<U+FB01>
  cients in the expressions for the stresses and strains are of course
  somewhat cumbrous; but for any speci<U+FB01>ed case, whether of gravita
  tion or rotation, or both combined, the solution becomes easily
  manageable.        It enables the variation in the effects of gravitation and
  rotation with the change I
                                  of shape of the ellipsoid to be completely
                     ‘
  traced.
      The comprehensiveness of the problem solved forbids more than a
  brief consideration of the general solution with illustrations of its
  application to a few of the more interesting special forms of ellipsoid.
  The results obtained for the very oblate and very oblong forms seem
  to show that in many cases of bodily forces the assumptions usually
  made in the treatment of thin plates and long rods would not be
  justi<U+FB01>ed.
      By comparison with the author’s previous researches, a close
  similarity is shown to exist between the phenomena in rotating <U+FB01>at
'
  ellipsoids and thin elliptic discs on the one hand, and rotating
  elongated ellipsoids and long elliptic cylinders on the other.
      Various results con<U+FB01>rmatory of the accuracy of the present solution
  are obtained by the application of the general formulae for the mean
   strains in elastic solids.       It is also shown that some of the results
   may   be   arrived  at by the use of approximate but simple methods.

    Since there appears        to be no de<U+FB01>nite information as to the elec
trical properties of pure elemental            substances which are not metals,
an attempt has been made to provide the necessary data in the case
of sulphur.        This element was chosen as being capable of easy puri
<U+FB01>cation, and because it can exist in a variety of forms, from the
comparison of the electrical behaviour of which some information
was expected to be obtained. The experimental work was begun in
1886, and some preliminary              results were published by one of the
authors and Mr. J. A. Pollock in the ‘ Philosophical Magazine’ for
1890.       These results referred to the construction of galvanometers
for high resistance measurements, the reliability of the Clark cell as
a source of small constant currents, and a method of using the gal
vanometer in resistance             measurements in such a way that no
                                                                                    '

This method consists in observing the galvanometer indication of         a
current passing through the substance of high resistance under a
known voltage, and subsequently causing the galvanometer to give
the same de<U+FB02>ection, by supplying it with a known fraction of the
voltage of 2. Clark cell, and allowing this to act on the galvanometer
when the latter is in series with a wire megohm standard. The dis
cussion of this method, depending as it does on the behaviour of
Clark cells from which currents are being taken, shows that it is
reliable; but it is not intended here to go over the preliminary
ground covered by the papers referred to. A considerable portion of
the investigation of which the paper is an account, and which
extends from 1889 to the present time (October, 1893), was made
conjointly with Mr. Pollock.
    The <U+FB01>rst part of the paper deals with the puri<U+FB01>cation of sulphur
as obtained from several sources, with the result that, in the end,
the following method was exclusively adopted.               This method is
based on the use of sulphur recovered by the Chance process, which
comes into commerce as pure to at least one part in ten thousand,
and results from burning hydrogen sulphide from alkali waste with
insuf<U+FB01>cient air for complete combustion.          The commercial product is
melted, and <U+FB01>ltered through glass wool and platinum gauze.‘ It is
then twice distilled, in such a manner as to be free from exposure to
dust: and sometimes it was subsequently freed from gas, by heating
in a vacuum to near the boiling point. The purity of the resulting
 sulphur is tested by the following criteria. It must be free from
 smell. It must leave no residue on evaporation from a platinum
 dish. When cooled suddenly from a high temperature, it must
remain of a clear yellow colour: when perfectly crystalline it must
be absolutely soluble in carbon bisulphide.          The absence of arsenic
 and selenium from the sulphur employed, was proved to about one
part in a million by burning the sulphur to trioxide and applying the
 appropriate tests.    The reaction by sulphur dioxide test for selen
ium, when properly carried out, is more delicate than the Marsh’s
 test for arsenic, even when the smell of the hydrogen is adopted as a
 criterion.    If a perceptible mirror of arsenic is to be accepted as a
 criterion, the arsenic test is still less delicate.
    A number of experiments are described, tending to show that
 neither arsenic nor selenium can possibly exist to any appreciable
 extent in alkali waste produced in the Leblanc process, so that the
 Chance sulphur is probably more free from these impurities than the
 limit we can reach by analysis. All other known impurities are got
 rid of by distillation and exhaustion 'in vacuo.
     Section 3 of the paper deals with a discussion of various methods
 of measuring high resistances, and gives the detail of the method
 adopted by us for rapidly effecting alternate measurements               of

   resistance and capacity. The method of producing <U+FB01>lms of pure
   sulphur between aluminium electrodes is also explained. It is neces
   sary to perform the melting, &c., in a gold vessel.
      Section 4 of the paper deals with the method of constructing gal
   vanometers of high sensitiveness and resistance.      In order to observe
   as small currents as possible, advantage was taken of every circum
   stance, both of observation and construction, likely to lead to
   enhanced sensitiveness.       For instance, instead of observing the
   steady de<U+FB02>ection, we habitually observed the throw of the needle on
   reversal of the current through the galvanometer. The steady de
   <U+FB02>ection was only observed as a check.
      The highest degree of sensitiveness we ever found it necessary to
   use, was such that the throw on reversal was 1 micrometer division
  for a current of 1'5Xl3-la amp‘eres, with a period of vibration of
  about 25 seconds.      1 micrometer division is divisible into <U+FB01>ve parts,
  so that the sensitiveness for least observable throw on reversal is
  3X10‘“ ampéres. This sensitiveness, however, cannot be taken ad
  vantage of, except with very elaborate contact keys, and under rare
  conditions of magnetic steadiness.      We adopted the Kelvin type of
  instrument.     We consider that the problem of sensitive galvano
  meter building has not hitherto been approached            in the proper
  manner. Almost any <U+FB01>rst-rate instrument will give enormous sensi
 tiveness on occasion: but this sensitiveness      is,  in general, accom
 panied by instability, and is useless in practice, on account of zero
 changes.      The really important matter  is   to ensure the presence of
 high sensitiveness with ease and certainty, not after hours of adjust
 ing, but immediately on the necessity arising; in this we have been
 perfectly successful.     Success in this matter depends entirely on a
 large number of details, for a discussion of which the paper must be
 consulted. Exact drawings are also provided, both of the instrument
 asa    whole, and of the more important subsidiary parts. The follow
 ing notes must suf<U+FB01>ce here.
   1.   It essential that the coils shall be adjustable to the magnetic
        is
 system after the latter is   mounted.
   2.   Astaticism of suf<U+FB01>cient perfection can only be secured by the
 simultaneous magnetisation of all the members of the magnetic
 system when they occupy their <U+FB01>nal relative positions.        This necessi
tates special appliances.
     3. If 'copper wireis    used for the coils, no other metal must be
included in     the circuit or connections of the instrument, otherwise
thermo-electric e<U+FB01>ects cannot be avoided.
  4.    The instrument has four tiers of coils and magnets, whereby
improved electromagnetic conditions are obtained.
  5.    The most important part of the instrument         is    that which
belongs to the adjusting of the magnetic control.            This must be

exceedingly stiff and well made, supported quite independently of
the astatic system, and capable of the <U+FB01>nest adjustment.
   6. Stability of zero depends chie<U+FB02>y on the uniformity of the con
trolling <U+FB01>eld all over the suspended system; this is, perhaps, best
obtained by using very large and symmetrically disposed magnets
above and below the suspended system.
   7. When this is attended to, there is no advantage          in using a
“ tail” magnet.
   8. The chief remaining dif<U+FB01>culty is found to be due to continual
small changes taking place in the direction of the earth’s horizontal
<U+FB01>eld. -This is best overcome by attending to the astaticism of the
magnets, and using a fairly strong uniform controlling <U+FB01>eld opposed
to that of the earth.
   9. It is essential that the instrument be entirely surrounded by
massive iron screens.
   10. A novel method of illumination has been worked out, ensuring
uniformity of brightness of the scale images, without any appre
ciable heating of the galvanometer. The transparent divisions of an
opaque scale are caused to give rise to interference fringes, which
are then observed in a telescope with a micrometer scale in the eye
piece.     Readings of the position of the magnetic system to one
second of arc can be easily and certainly made.                   -
   11. The most important improvements we have made relate to the
insulation of the instrument, the minute adjustment of the con
trolling <U+FB01>eld, the recognition of the necessary conditions for high
sensitiveness combined with stability, and the method of optical
magni<U+FB01>cation.      The instrument can now be used at the sensitiveness
mentioned    with  all the ease and certainty which is generally attained
with a millionfold less sensitiveness.
   12. Further improvements can be made by using some material of
greater strength than glass for the mirror, and by improved magnetic
screening.     Our screens were of cast iron, and weighed about 300
pounds   ; the  screening was not nearly su<U+FB01>iciently perfect.
   Section  5  contains an account of a large number of experiments
extending over three years on the phenomena of conduction in
sulphur—0f which the following are the chief results.
   Crystalline sulphur, whether monoclinic or “ aged” monoclinic——
(which we have ventured to distinguish as a distinct variety, since it
preserves the melting point, but is divested of the crystallographic
properties of fresh monoclinic sulphur) has a speci<U+FB01>c resistance of
1028 C.G.S. units as a minimum.       By exposure to the air of a room
the sulphur condenses moisture, which reduces its apparent speci<U+FB01>c
resistance, but not nearly so much as in the parallel case of glass.
The total residual charge is either absent, or less than four parts in
ten thousand of the original charge, when a <U+FB01>lm of sulphur about a
                                                               n 2

  quarter of a millimeter thick is charged for ten minutes with about
 300 volts.    By very careful drying we have succeeded in reducing
 the residual charge with a <U+FB01>lm of mica 0'2 mm. thick to about 1 per
 cent. of the original charge under similar circumstances.
    In view of the want of homogeneity in the crystalline sulphur
 <U+FB01>lm this freedom from residual effect is noteworthy, and is perhaps
                                                             '
 to be explained by the entire absence of conductivity.
    Crystalline sulphur has an electric strength which is more than
 enough to support 33,000 volts per centimeter—how much more we
 do not know.     At 75° C the speci<U+FB01>c resistance with 285 volts per
 quarter millimeter falls to about 6'8X10” C.G.S.           The speci<U+FB01>c
 inductive capacity increases slightly as the temperature rises.      As
 the temperature of the sulphur rises the conductivity increases
 slightly up to the melting point, when there is an enormous increase.
    When a. <U+FB01>lm containing about 5 per cent. of insoluble sulphur pro~
 duced by cooling rapidly from a temperature above             170° C is
 examined, it is found to have     a  sensible conductivity which is not
 due to surface action, for it is not altered by fusing quartz rods into
the exposed part of the surface, nor by blowing air saturated with
 water vapour against the surface. The conductivity depends on the
 exact composition of the mixture of soluble and insoluble sulphur,
but maybe taken at from 1025 to 10""5 C.G.S. units for a <U+FB01>lm contain-.
ing from three to six per cent. of amorphous unstable sulphur at
ordinary temperatures.      This conductivity is always greater when
the voltage of about 300 volts on a. <U+FB01>lm a quarter of a millimeter
thick is <U+FB01>rst applied, or reversed.       It is established that the in-.
creased conductivity occurs after the sulphur has rested—whether
the voltage is applied for the <U+FB01>rst time, or whether it has been
applied before in either direction.       When the voltage is reversed
this e<U+FB01>ect is more strongly marked, and the conductivity only settles
to a steady value after a considerable time.      The conduction, either
when the current is steady, or when it commences or is reversed,
does not obey Ohm’s law either for small voltages (say eight volts)
or large ones (say 300) when the <U+FB01>lm is 025 mm. thick.              The
deviation is, however, greater at high voltages, and greater when
the “commencing”        or “reversing” e<U+FB02>ects are taking place than
 when the conduction is steady.        The deviation is always in the
direction of making the conduction at high electromotive intensities
greater than at low. The speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacity of a mixture of
soluble and insoluble sulphur is markedly higher than that of purely
crystalline sulphur. We have some evidence that the changes occur
ring during the <U+FB01>rst few days after the <U+FB01>lm is made lead to an
increase of speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacity.       The temperature coef<U+FB01>cient
of the speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacity is positive, and of the order 2 x 10“
per degree between    20° and 70°}

    The residual charge is larger than when the sulphur is purely
soluble, and with about 400 volts per millimeter is about 187 per
cent. of the initial charge after 10 minutes’ charge; the condenser
being discharged for a fraction of a second and left for 10 minutes.
At lower electromotive intensities it is rather greater in comparison
with the initial charge, su<U+FB01>iciently so to be distinctly noticeable.
    On heating the sulphur the conduction increases from about 50° C,
in fact whenever the process of annealing takes place. When the
annealing change (destruction of amorphous sulphur, and formation
of soluble sulphur) is taking place rapidly the conduction is consider
able. Many attempts made for the purpose of deciding whether the
increase of conductivity depends on the mere proportion of insoluble
sulphur present, or whether it depends on the rate at which the
conversion process is taking place, yielded no absolutely certain
results, but the evidence, such as it is, points to the latter as being
probably the most important—but we do not consider that it can
explain the conductivity at low temperatures.          This conductivity is
essentially  discontinuous, and  in this resembles  the  conduction through
moisture <U+FB01>lms condensed on glass, ebonite,      and   sulphur itself.
    Several of the above-mentioned peculiarities of sulphur conduction
were observed by Quincke in the case of insulating liquids, and were
ascribed, in part at all events, to the action of dust motes in the
liquids.    There is no doubt, however, that in the case of sulphur
these   effects are inherent to the process of conduction, for they were
as strongly marked in what we consider to have been our purest <U+FB01>lm
 (as tested by the colour) as in the least pure one. There is some evi
 dence that mixtures of insoluble and soluble sulphur show a maxi
 mum conductivity when the sulphur contact is between 5 and 3 per
cent. All the phenomena of conduction are also noticed—the speci<U+FB01>c
resistance being about the same—when we examine <U+FB01>lms containing
‘88 per cent. of insoluble sulphur, produced by applying enormous
 pressures in a testing machine to the insoluble sulphur formed on
suddenly cooling sulphur from a high temperature. The sulphur,
 which was originally plastic, was exhausted with carbon bisulphide,
 and the residue treated with sulphur chloride to obtain stability.       A
 pressure equal to the weight of 100,000, pounds on an area of say
 .25 square inches, causes about 12 per cent. of the insoluble sulphur
 to become soluble, whether it has been treated with sulphur chloride
 or not. Check experiments on soluble sulphur showed that the very
 pure benzene used to moisten the sulphur for the purpose of com
 pression produces no subsequent change in the conductivity.            The
 pressures were applied for from <U+FB01>ve to 10 minutes.
    No change in the conductivity of mixed <U+FB01>lms was produced by
 stressing in alternate directions with a frequency of, say, <U+FB01>ve per
 second, and a voltage of from 100 to 200 volts per quarter millimeter.

     A very large quantity of exact numerical data referring to these
 points is contained in the paper.
     Part  II of the paper is interposed as the facts disclosed bear on
  the general argument. This part of the paper bears on several corre
 lated questions.
     Section 1 deals with the contact force in air between purely soluble
 sulphur and mixtures of insoluble and soluble sulphur containing
 about 10 per cent. of the former.
    The result of some rather interesting work on this point by the
 electrometer needle method, shows that when soluble and mixed
 sulphur is in contact (produced by melting the parts together), there
 is a contact force of the order of from one to two volts between them.
 The positive charge is on the insoluble sulphur.      These experiments
 were made by using a double sulphur needle over metallic semicircles,
and also by using the ordinary metallic electrometer needle over
sulphur quadrants.       The latter gives the best results. The phe
nomena are very complicated, and require to be carefully sifted ; for
an account of the very considerable dif<U+FB01>culties the paper must be
consulted.                                           a
    Section 2 deals with the question as to whether light has any
effect on the conductivity of sulphur. Monckman (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’
vol. 46, 1890) considers that he has discovered such an effect.         A
very large number of experiments, however, on mixed and crystal
line sulphur cells, failed to indicate to us any such peculiarity, and
we consider that Monckman           must have been mistaken in this
matter.
    Section 3 deals with the qualitative phenomena of. conduction in.
sulphur cells containing from 5 per cent. to 20 per cent. of insoluble
sulphur.      The general results agree with those already described,
although the methods of preparing and quenching the viscous
sulphur were di<U+FB01>erent.      The electrodes were also of platinum wire
instead of aluminium plates. The temperature resistance changes
are treated rather fully in this section, and bring into prominence
the enormous in<U+FB02>uence of the annealing process.
    Section 4 deals with a determination of the speci<U+FB01>c inductive
capacity of sulphur by the method of weighing, and contains an
account of the different sources of error to which we discovered the
method was subject.        Several ways of obtaining the required
potential diiference were investigated, with the result that the most
satisfactory is by the use of an alternator giving a frequency of about
sixty, and an induction coil used as a transformer.       This avoids the
dif<U+FB01>culty which occurs when the sulphur plates get charged in virtue
of their conductivity, and is noticed whenever (I) a continuously
directed P.D., or (2) an unequal alternating one (as by a coil with
hammer or mercury break) is used.

    Part  I is then continued.      § 6 deals with an investigation of the
 speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacity     of various   kinds of sulphur by the method
 of weighing, advantage being taken of the laborious investigation
 of the method dealt with in Part II. Various other matters came to
 light, and we furnish a drawing of suitable apparatus and describe
 the necessary course of procedure to make the method accurate and
 satisfactory; in particular the proper way of preparing plates of
 crystalline and friable substances.       The results for the speci<U+FB01>c induc
 tive capacities are as follows, at a temperature of 14° C.

    An experiment on purely amorphous sulphur is not yet ready for
 publication; but the above results will go a long way to clear up the
 great differences in the hitherto published values of this constant
 for sulphur. They also serve as a check on our observations on thin
 <U+FB01>lms, and show that our measurements of <U+FB01>lm thickness—a grave
 di<U+FB02>iculty—were moderately successful.                                    _
    A number of experiments bearing on a theory of conduction which
 we venture to suggest are also included in this part of the paper.
    This is followed by an account of the theory to which our experi
 ments led us, and which is brie<U+FB02>y as follows.           Sulphur in either of
 the extreme conditions does not conduct; we can only examine the
 purely soluble state, for the other is not su<U+FB01>iciently stable for a
 satisfactory investigation; however, we may say that changing the
 content of amorphous unstable sulphur from 3 per cent. to 88 per
cent., produces little or no change in the conductivity.         Taking this
and other facts into consideration, we believe that what we have
called mixtures of the two kinds of suiphur are really compounds,
 and that the conduction is electrolytic.
    We have framed what we believe to be a novel theory of electro
lysis, which explains all the facts which we have observed, and which
has the peculiarity of introducing the idea of an electrolytic con
vection current, in connection with which the resulting changes of
speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacity allow of all the phenomena of conduction
observed taking place, though the charges may never really reach
the electrodes.      It will be seen that the effects of fatigue-reversal
and the phenomena of discontinuous conduction are well accounted
for by this theory.      The only objections we have to it are that it is
based on a molecular- theory of matter, which we are persuaded requires
to be remodelled, if it is to afford any real explanation of things as they
are.   A theory of residual e<U+FB01>ect based on the theory .of conduction is

also proposed.    This differs from Maxwell's theory in that the latter
merely postulates changes of speci<U+FB01>c resistance and speci<U+FB01>c induc
tive capacity from point to point of the dielectric, while our theory is
distinctly chemical.       We consider that our results on mixed <U+FB01>lms are
best explained by the theory we propose, though the dif<U+FB01>culty of dis
proving Maxwell's theory is almost equal to the dif<U+FB01>culty of establish
ing it, and we do not wish to imply that some sort of explanation on
this theory may not be constructed to <U+FB01>t in with our observations.
This is a point, however, on which we are still engaged.                   The matter
may, perhaps,    be   best  summed      up'   in   the   statement   that the evidence
we have against       Maxwell’s     theory      is   nearly   worthless;  but that we
do not consider this theory necessary if our theory of conduction be
accepted.

                                      (Abstract)
    The equations of motion of viscous <U+FB02>uid (obtained by grafting on
 certain terms to the abstract equations of the Eulerian form so as to
 adapt these equations to the case of <U+FB02>uids subject to stresses depend
 ing in some hypothetical manner on the rates of distortion, which
 equations Navier* seems to have <U+FB01>rst introduced in 1822, and which
 were much studied by Cauchyf and Poissoni) were <U+FB01>nally shown
 by St. Venant§ and Sir Gabriel Stokes,“ in 1845, to involve no other
 assumption than that the stresses, other than that of pressure uniform
 in all directions, are linear functions of the rates of distortion with a
  co-e<U+FB01>icient depending on the physical state of the <U+FB02>uid.
     By obtaining a singular solution of these equations as applied to
  the case of pendulums in steady periodic motion Sir G. Stokes<U+FB02>l was
  able to compare the theoretical results with the numerous experi
  ments that had been recorded, with the result that the theoretical
  calculations agreed so closely with the experimental determinations
  as seemingly to prove the truth of the assumption involved. This was
  also the result of comparing the <U+FB02>ow of water through uniform tubes
  with the <U+FB02>ow calculated from a singular solution of the equations so
  long as the tubes were small and the velocities slow.                   On the other

hand, these results, both theoretical and practical, were directly at
variance with common experience as to the' resistance encountered by
iarger bodies moving with higher velocities through water, or by
water moving with greater velocities through larger tubes. This dis
crepancy Sir G. Stokes considered as probably resulting from eddies
which rendered the actual motion other than that to which the sin
gular solution referred and not as disproving the assumption.
   In 1850, after Joule’s discovery of the Mechanical Equivalent of
Heat, Stokes showed, by transforming the equations of motion——with
arbitrary stresses—so as to obtain the equation of (“ Vis-viva ”)
energy, that this equation contained a de<U+FB01>nite function, which repre
sented the difference between the work done on the <U+FB02>uid by the
stresses and the rate of increase of the energy per unit of volume,
which function, he concluded, must, according to Joule, represent the
Vis-viva converted into heat.
   This conclusion was obtained from the equations irrespective of any
particular relation between the stresses and the rates of distortion.
 Sir G. StOkes, however, translated the function into an expression in
terms of the rates of distortion, which expression has since been
named by Lord Rayleigh the Dissipation Function.
   In 1883 the author succeeded in proving, by means of experiments
with colour bands—the results of which were communicated to the
Society*—that when water is caused by pressure to <U+FB02>ow through a
uniform smooth pipe, the motion of the water is direct, i.e., parallel to
the sides of the pipe, or sinuous, i.e., crossing and recrossing the pipe,
according as Um, the mean velocity of the water, as measured by
dividing Q, the discharge by A, the area of the section of the pipe, is
below or above a certain value given by KIu/Dp, where D is the
diameter of the pipe, p the density of the water, and K a numerical
constant, the value of which according to the author’s experiments
and, as he was able to show, to all the experiments by Poiseuille and

by the velocity of the <U+FB02>uid and the product of the molecular dimen
sions multiplied by the molecular velocities which determine the
value of  ,ufor the <U+FB02>uid, also that the equations of motion for viscous
<U+FB02>uid contained evidence of this relation.
   These experimental results completely removed the discrepancy
previously noticed, showing that, whatever may be the cause, in those
cases in which the experimental results do not accord with those
obtained by the singular solution of the equations, the actual motions
of the water are different.       But in this there is only   a partial
explanation, for there remains the mechanical or physical signi<U+FB01>cance
of the existence of the criterion to be explained.
   In the present paper the author applies the dynamical theory to
the motion of incompressible viscous <U+FB02>uids to show—
   (a.) That the adoption of the conclusion arrived at by Sir Gabriel
Stokes, that the dissipation function represents the rate at which
heat is  produced, adds a de<U+FB01>nition to the meaning of u, 'v, w—the
components      of mean     or <U+FB02>uid velocity—which     was previously
wanting;
  (1).) That  as the result of this de<U+FB01>nition the equations are true, and
are only true, as applied to <U+FB02>uid in which the mean-motions of the
matter, excluding the heat motions, are steady     ;
   (0.) That the evidence of the possible existence of such steady
mean-motions, while at the same time the conversion of the energy of
these mean-motions into heat       is going on, proves the existence of
some discriminative cause by which the periods in space and time of
the mean-motion are prevented from approximating in magnitude to
the corresponding periods of the heat motions; and also proves the
existence of some general action by which the energy of mean-motion
is  continually transformed into the energy of heat-motion without
passing through any intermediate stage;
  (d.) That as applied to <U+FB02>uid in unsteady mean-motion (excluding

 1894.]       Theory  of Incompressible Viscous Fluids,    &0.           43
 the heat-motions), however steady the mean integral <U+FB02>ow may be,.
 the equations are approximately true in a degree which increases
 with the ratios of the magnitudes of the periods, in time and space, of'
 the mean-motion to the magnitude of the corresponding periods of
 the heat-motions ;
    (9.) That if the discriminative cause and the action of transformation
 are the result of general properties of matter, and not of properties
which a<U+FB01>ect only the ultimate motions, there must exist evidence of
similar actions as between mean-mean-motion, in directions of mean
<U+FB02>ow, and the periodic mean-motions taken relative to the mean-mean
motion but excluding heat-motions. And that such evidence must
be of a general and important kind, such as the unexplained laws of
the resistance of <U+FB02>uid motions, the law of the universal dissipation of
energy and the second law of thermodynamics ;
   (     That the generality of the e<U+FB01>'ects of the properties on which
the action of transformation depends is proved‘by the evidence that
resistance, other than proportional to the velocity, is caused by the
relative (eddying) mean~motion.
   (g.) That the existence of the discriminative cause is directly proved
by the existence of the criterion, the dependence of which on circum
stances which limit the magnitudes of the periods of relative-mean
motion, as compared with the heat motion, also proves the generality
of the e<U+FB01>ects of the properties on which it depends.
   (h.) That the proof of the generality of the e<U+FB01>ects of the proper-.
ties on which the discriminative cause and the action of transforma
tion depend, shows that—if in the equations of motion the mean-mean
motion is distinguished from the relative-mean-motion in the same
way as the mean-motion is distinguished from the heat-motions—
(1) the equations must centain expressions for the transformation of
the energy of mean-mean-motion to energy of relative-mean-motion ;
and (2) that the equation, when integrated over a complete system,
must show that the possibility of relative-mean-motion depends on
the ratio of the possible magnitudes of the periods of relative-mean
motion, as compared with the corresponding magnitude of the periods
of the heat-motions.
   (i.) That when the equations are transformed so as to distinguish
between the mean-mean-motions of in<U+FB01>nite periods and the relative
mean-motion of <U+FB01>nite periods, there result two distinct systems of
equations, one system for mean-mean-motion, as affected by relative
mean-motions and heat-motion, the other system for relative-mean
motion as affected by mean-mean-motion and heat-motions.
   (     That the equation of energy of mean-mean-motion, as ob-
tained from the <U+FB01>rst system, shows that the rate of increase of energy
is diminished by conversion into heat, and by transformation of
energy of mean-mean-motion in consequence of the relative-means

motion, which transformation is expressed by a function identical in
form with that which expresses the conversion into heat; and that
the equation of energy of relative-mean-motion, obtained from the
second system, shows that this energy is increased only by transform
ation of energy from mean-mean-motion expressed by the same
function, and diminished only by the conversion of energy of relative
mean-motion into heat.
           That the di<U+FB01>erence of the two rates (1) transformation of
energy of mean-mean-motion into energy of relative-mean-motion as
expressed by the transformation        function, (2) the conversion of
energy of relative-mean-motion into heat, as expressed by the func
tion expressing dissipation of the energy of relative-mean-motion,
affords a discriminating equation as to the conditions under which
relative-mean-motion can be maintained.
    (1.) That this discriminating equation is independent of the energy
of relative-mean-motion, and expresses a relation between variations
of mean-mean-motion of the <U+FB01>rst order, the space periods of relative
mean-motion‘ and ,u/p such that any circumstances which determine
the maximum periods of the relative-mean-motion determine the
conditions of mean-meau-motion under which relative mean-motion
 will be maintained—determine the criterion :
    (m.) That as applied to water in steady mean <U+FB02>ow between parallel
 plane surfaces, the boundary conditions and the equation of con
 tinuity impose limits to the maximum space periods of relative
 mean-motion such that the discriminating equation a<U+FB01>ords de<U+FB01>nite

 is less than a certain number, which depends on the shape of the
section of the boundaries and is constant as long as there is geo
 metrical similarity.    While for greater values of this function, in so
 far as the discriminating equation shows, the energy of sinuous
 motion may increase until it reaches to a de<U+FB01>nite limit, and rules the
 resistance.
     (11.) That besides thus a<U+FB01>ording a mechanical explanation of the
 existence of the criterion K, the discriminating equation shows the
 purely geometrical circumstances on which the value of K depends,
 and although these circumstances must satisfy geometrical conditions
 required for steady mean-motion other than those imposed by the
 conservations of mean energy and momentum, the theory admits of

  odd; the series being continued until one of the factorials in the
  denominator becomes negative; and n being supposed greater than

      A similar series gives the values of u,,,,(1r/2) when m is odd, and

     When n—r is even, the values of u,,,,(1r/2) when m is odd, and of

      The value of am is in all cases equal to um, and the value of cm, is
  equal to cm. This result gives several algebraic identities, using
  general values 0f umr-          Since “a; = P(n,r,,u), we have by this result

     Thus     the line integral    of a Laplace’s function referred to the <U+FB01>rst
  pole along      a small circle described about the second pole at angular
  distance 8 from it is the value of the function at the second pole
  multiplied by 21rP,,(v) .sin 5, where v is cos 8.
      Equations can also be obtained connecting 11mm, and u,,+1m,, where
  the n’s are different.        The most useful result is

  and a similar equation obtained by interchanging u and 1). From this
  equation a table of the functions for different values of n can be cal
  culated, and is given from n = O to n = 4. Since 'vm'o = 00,", == 0, the
  number of the functions for any given value of n is (n+ 1)2+n’.
      Two physical applications of the results are given. The <U+FB01>rst is an
  application of the result of a line integral of a Laplace’s function re
  ferred to one pole along a small circle described about another.                  The
  result is employed to establish that the law assumed by Boltzmann and
  Maxwell for the number of particles which have a given velocity in

an irregular system of moving molecules (or a “disturbed gas”) is
unaltered in form by collisions between the molecules.     In the second
application the functions are used to <U+FB01>nd the mutual potential energy of
two layers of gravitating matter on two spheres, the density at any
point on each sphere being expressed in terms of spherical harmonics,

two ellipsoids not diifering much from spheres          also worked outis

  This paper gives the results of a continuation of the investigation
which formed the subject of a paper communicated to the Royal
Society in 1892, and published in the ‘Philosophical Transactions,’
    VOL. LVI-                                                                         E

50        illeasurement   of the Jlagnetic Properties of Iron.     [May 24,
vol. 184,    A, pp. 531—542. The results now given have been to a
large  extent    obtained by the same method, namely, from the curves
giving the relation of the current <U+FB02>owing in the circuit to the time
measured from the application or the reversal of the impressed
          on the circuit.    In this case, however, the personal element
has been eliminated from the curves by the application of the
autographic recorder referred to as under construction in the
previous paper.        This apparatus, which is a modi<U+FB01>cation of the
“ Thomson
               siphon-recorder," has been found to work satisfactorily, and
has considerably increased the ease and the accuracy with which the
curves can be produced.           A description of the apparatus and
specimens of the curves drawn by it are included in the paper.
There is also included in this paper a description of the apparatus
and method of experiment in the application of a wattmeter to the
determination of the energy dissipated by transformers under
E.M.F.’s of different frequency of alternation. The accuracy of the
measurements so made were checked by comparison with the results
of measurements made by Joubert’s instantaneous contact method.
The apparatus and method of experiment adopted for the application
of this method were to some extent di<U+FB01>erent from those commonly
employed, and they are therefore described.
   The results of some further experiments on the large electromagnet
used in the previous experiments, and described in the paper above
referred to, are given, but a large part of the results quoted in this paper
refer to closed circuit transformers of the types manufactured by the
Westinghouse and the General Electric Companies.                The experi
ments have been chie<U+FB02>y directed to the following points :—
    1. A Comparison     of the Total Energy required to produce Di<U+FB02>'erent
Magnetic Inductions, and the Corresponding Dissipation of Energy.—
In connection with this, the e<U+FB01>ect of air gap in the magnetic circuit
 has been investigated somewhat more fully.           It is shown that, by
 introducing a moderate air gap, the energy dissipated for a given
 induction through the coils may be reduced one-third.
    2. The Law of Variation of Hysteresis with Variation of Induction.—
 The experiments indicate that, although for any special case the
energy dissipated can be approximately expressed by an equation of
the form E = AB“, that both A and a. are di<U+FB01>erent for di<U+FB01>erent kinds
 of iron.     It seems probable, also, from the results obtained, that a is
 not absolutely constant for any one iron, but that it increases with
 increase of B.
    3. The    Efect of Increased Frequency of Cyclic Variation      of llIag
 netism on the Dissipation of Energy.-—In this investigation        a trans
 former, the iron case of which was made up of very thin sheets, was
 used. The thickness of the sheets was about 16-100ths of a millimetre,
 and the sheets were insulated from each other by means of thin

watts. The range of frequency (including the autographic recorder,
                                  J
the wattmeter and the oubert’s instantaneous contact method experi
ments) was about from 3 per minute to 8,000 per minute. The results
indicated that, throughout this range, there is no variation in the
dissipation of energy per cycle when the inductions are equal.
   Data deduced from these experiments as to the magnetic qualities
of the iron used in the different transformers are given in the paper.

   Three years ago Dr. Ransome communicated to the Society the
results of some experiments, carried out in concert with Professor
Dreschfeld, of Owens College, “On certain conditions that modify
the virulence of the bacillus of tubercle.”
   The tendency of these researches was to prove “ that fresh air and
light, and a dry and sandy sub-soil, have a distinct in<U+FB02>uence in
arresting the virulence of the tubercle-bacillus; that darkness some
what interferes with this disinfectant action; but that mere exposure                          _
to light, in otherwise bad sanitary conditions, does not destroy the
virus.”                                                                              —

      We have now carried the enquiry a little further, and,
  amongst other objects, have endeavoured to determine how short a
  period of exposure to air and light would suf<U+FB01>ce to destroy the
  poisonous action of the microbe. We selected guinea-pigs as the
  most susceptible animals to test this question.
      In the <U+FB01>rst instance pure cultivations of the bacillus were pre
  pared, and were found to be active by frequent inoculations.
   Small portions of this material were :spread in a thin layer,
  upon pieces of sterilized paper.               They were arranged in circles
  of   about   2 mm.   in  diameter, so   as  to    give every opportunity for the
   action of the elements.         They were then exposed in a glass-room,
   with free access to air and light, i.e.,','close to open windows, for
  diminishing periods of time, viz., 14, 10, 6, 4, and 2 days respec
  tively.      Contemporaneous daily records were kept of temperature,
  maximum and minimum, and of the amount of sunshine taken
  through the glass roof, by means of one of Negretti and Zambra’s
  sunshine recorders.                                                         '
       The following table (Table II) gives the results of the meteorol
  ogical observations, but as will be seen presently, only those for the
  <U+FB01>rst few days are of importance.
      No result from the other papers; the control exPeriments showing
  that the bacilli used after this date had lost their virulence. Even
  the results of Experiments 97 and 98 are doubtful on that account,
  but Experiment 85 was made with a very virulent specimen, as was
‘
  proved by the inoculation of two other guinea-pigs, with paper in
  fected with the same quantity of the same cultivation, and kept the
  same length of time, but not exposed to sunlight.               In both these cases
  advanced tuberculosis was produced in 44’ days.
      It may be noted that only one of these experiments can be en
  tirely relied upon, and that in this case, after 4 days’ exposure to
  air and 1214- hours of sunshine, there was no result from the inocu
  lation.
      These observations, though not in any way conclusive,_ are in
  accord with those of Professor Koch)“ and they encouraged us to
  believe that even short exposures of the tubercle-bacillus, even in
  sputum, to air and light, might render it innocuous.
      In the next series of observations, it was determined to allow
      * Koch, ‘ Verhandlungen des Internationalen Medicinischen Congresses ’ (Berlin,
  4th to 9th August, 1890), vol. 1, p. 35. Koch says that for some years it has
  become known      that light could kill bacteria.    He alludes, no doubt, to the ex
  periments of Downes and Blunt, Arloing, Roux, and others.            Marshall Ward's
  experiments with the Bacillus Anihrac’is are still more recent.       Koch had been
  able to con<U+FB01>rm this with regard to the tubercle-bacillus,        of which cultivations
  exposed to sunlight might be killed in a space of time varying from a few
  minutes to some hours.       When exposed to diffuse daylight in aroom they were
  killed in from <U+FB01>ve to seven days.

   The results of these experiments are somewhat anomalous.          Tho
sputum was in rather thick masses and thus dried slowly, and would
with dif<U+FB01>culty be a<U+FB01>ected by the natural agents to which they were
exposed.    This fact would probably account for the continued viru

eight days exposure   to a current  of air in darkness,    hardly likely   is
to be due to this exposure; we can, therefore, draw no decided con
clusion from this series of experiments.
   In the fourth series of observations, the sputum was spread upon
paper, and was thus more rapidly dried at the ordinary tempera
tures, about 24 hours sui<U+FB01>cing. It was then in most cases scraped
and thus partly converted into “tuberculous dust” before being
exposed to the same conditions as before.       In this way    might be         it
 expected to be more readily affected by the elements.
   An attempt was made to measure the amount of air as well as
light, an anemometer and a sunshine-recorder being placed near
the sputum exposed at the open window.
   Only a rough guess could thus be made as to the quantity of air
passing over the sputum, however, for the papers had to be loosely
 covered with thin gauze to prevent the “dust” from being carried
away by the wind, and the anemometer recorded currents in both
directions.

 of those exposed in the draught-closet, only three days were allowed
 to pass before they were removed from the in<U+FB02>uence of the air
 current. On the other hand, all the specimens exposed to both air and
 light, whether for two, three, or seven days, were found to have en
 tirely lost their power for evil.
    The specimen exposed for two days only, had, however, been kept
 for four weeks before being exposed to these in<U+FB02>uences, and it
  had thus lost a portion of its virulence.

    It has    long been known that the disease is most common in the
dirty, ill-drained, ill-ventilated dwellings of the poor, and, even in
records intended to prove the contagionsness of phthisis, there are
few, if any, of transmission of the disease in clean, well-lighted,
well-ventilated houses or hospitals, even those for consumption.
Long before Koch’s discoveries, and before the disinfection of sputum
was practised as it is now, the conveyance                  of the disease, under
these conditions, was recognised by many to be one of the rarest
events.
    If the results that we have obtained with sputum are con<U+FB01>rmed
by others, as we trust they will be, they will afford some explanation
of   these facts.
    So far as they extend at present, they show (1) that <U+FB01>nely divided
tuberculous matter, such'as pure cultures of the bacillus, or “ tuber
culous dust," in daylight, and in free currents of air, is rapidly de
prived of virulence, (2) that even in the dark, although the action is
retarded, fresh air has still some disinfecting in<U+FB02>uence, and (3) that in
the absence of air, or in con<U+FB01>ned air, the bacillus retains its power
for long periods of time?“F
 VI. “ On some Voltaic Combinations with a Fused Electrolyte
          and a Gaseous Depolariser.” By J. W. SWAN, M.A. Com
          municated by Loan RAYLEIGH, Sec. R.S. Received Feb
          ruary 28,     1894.
     It is well known that fused salts behave in many respects like
 electrolytes in solution, and that voltaic combinations analogous to
 well-known voltaic cells may be formed with fused electrolytes.
     The experiments of Brown'f have recently illustrated this subject
 in relation to the Daniell type of cell. For various reasons it
 appeared to the writer desirable to ascertain the behaviour of a cell
 with fused electrolyte and a gaseous depolariser, and corresponding
 in this last particular to the Up ward cell.
      The following is chie<U+FB02>y a record of some of the experiments made
 in connection with this research.
      A cell of this kind may be looked at from a theoretical point of
 view as follows :—A rod of metal, M (<U+FB01>g. 1), is immersed in a fused
 chloride of the same metal, MCI, and a chemically inactive conductor,
  C, is also immersed in the fused salt; when M and C are connected
 with an electrostatic volt-meter, the metallic chloride is immediately

polarised by    the  opposing couple,   formed   by   the  cathion   of the
electrolyte M and the pole C. To prevent this polarisation, chlorine
has to be supplied at this pole.         Complete depolarisation should
occur if  the pole  C consisted of a solid rod of chlorine.     This    im
                                                                       is
possible, but gaseous chlorine, used as a depolariser, can be made to
effect more or less complete depolarisation, and should, theoretically,
yield as the result of its heat of combination with lead an E.M.F. of
1'7942 volts.    In experiments made with a view to realise as nearly
as possible the ideal condition for preventing polarisation the cathode
was always molten lead.       It was found that hard gas-retort carbon
had very little action upon molten alkaline chlorides and on chloride
of lead, at the temperature required for their fusion. Carbon was,
therefore, employed as the anode or conducting pole in most of the
combinations.
   The electrolyte used was either the molten chlorides of sodium and
potassium mixed, or chloride of lead.      As there       continuous form

<U+FB01>nd a suitable way of applying the chlorine. The following are
details of some of the most suggestive of them.
   Exp. 1.—A cell was constructed as shown in <U+FB01>g. 2. The arrange

covering the bottom to some depth, over the lead is a layer of NaCl
and KCl previously fused, into which is immersed the lower and
closed end of a carbon tube, which forms the + pole.       The mouth of
the carbon tube is closed by a <U+FB01>re-clay lid luted on, and through
 which pass two small clay tubes for the inlet and outlet of chlorine.
The whole was heated in a small gas furnace. A binding screw on
the iron vessel, which served as a connection with the lead, was used
as the negative terminal, and another screw <U+FB01>xed on a copper ring
surrounding the carbon tube, served as the positive pole connection.
The <U+FB01>rst trial was made without chlorine.       Short circuited through
1,000 ohms the cell developed an E.M.F. of 0'3 volt.       A momentary
current of more than one ampere was observed when the cell was
short circuited through a low resistance ammeter.          Chlorine was
then passed through the tubes inside the carbon pole, but no depolar
ising e<U+FB01>'ect was observed, even when the chlorine had a slightly
higher pressure than the atmosphere, yet the gas passed through the
exposed sides of the carbon tube and through the cement at the top.
This experiment was repeated several times with carbon tubes of the
smallest possible thickness, and always with the same result. It is
evident, therefore, that an absorption of chlorine similar to that which
takes place in the Upward cell does not occur when a molten electro
lyte of the kind employed in this experiment is used.

 proportions of NaGl,KCl.     A porous pot was introduced in order to
separate the products of electrolysis set free at the electrodes.    The
chlorine gas was supplied through a clay tube, which passed dOWn

as the containing vessel for the fused lead and the electrolyte, it also
served as a means of electrical connection with the lead.     In relation
to the depolarisation eifect of the chlorine, which it was the principal
object of the experiment to observe, the interfering action of the iron
was found by cgmparison with porcelain to be practically m'l ; this no
doubt is a consequence of its becoming coated by local action with a
<U+FB01>lm of lead. The whole arrangement was heated in a reverberatory
furnace. When the electrolyte was perfectly fused, the element was
short circuited through a volt-meter of 1000 ohms resistance.         An
E.M.F. of 0'3 volt was observed, the outside current being from the
carbon to the lead.     This was the             after polarisation.    A
current of chlorine was then passed through the earthenware tube;
while the current of gas was slow there was no eifect, but when the
speed of the issuing gas was increased until the gas passed in bubbles
along the side of the carbon, alternately surrounding it with chlorine
and electrolyte, the E.M.F. rose to 1'25 volt. The action of the cell
was then similar to a completely depolarised cell. When short
circuited through a low resistance ammeter, it produced a steady
current of 1'0 ampere for three-quarters of an hour. The potential
difference between the poles was of course very small, while this
current was passing, the exterior resistance being very small com

pared with the interior.   When, however, the circuit was opened, it
almost instantly rose to 1'25 volt.
    So far the experiments showed that, as chlorine is nearly or per
fectly insoluble in fused chloride of lead, or in fused chlorides of
sodium and potassium, it is necessary in this case that the surface of the
carbon pole on which the cathion is deposited be alternately exposed to
the action of the gas and electrolyte.   Many experiments con<U+FB01>rmed
this conclusion.    The exposed surface of the carbon tube in this
experiment amounted to only 10 or 12 sq. cm.
   Exp. 3.—-As in the arrangement last described, the use of a porous
pot and a clay tube was found to be objectionable, through the action
of the electrolyte upon them, an arrangement was devised by which
the use of the porous pot and tube were avoided.         The details are
seen in <U+FB01>g. 4.   The carbon tube serves as an electrode, and also for
conveying the chlorine to the electrolyte. To render it impervious
to the gas, it was surrounded by a close-<U+FB01>tting porcelain tube.      This
tube was closed at the top by a parai<U+FB01>ncd cork, through which a
glass tube in connection with the chlorine supply was passed.         The
                                   /
remainder of the apparatus was the same as in Experiment 2, but

without the porous pot.   This arrangement gave the following
results. The E.M.F. when short-circuited through a voltmeter
(300 ohms) gave 1'41 volt, the chlorine entering rapidly. When
short-circuited through 1 ohm, it gave a constant current of 0'6
ampere with RD. of 0'9 volt. The rather large interior resistance
               1!.
of 1'3 ohm is due not to the electrolyte, but to the greater length of
the carbon tube, and bad contacts produced by the corrosive action
of the chlorine. No good results were obtained until the chlorine gas
bubbled out of the carbon tube, thus realising the conditions before
mentioned, as necessary for the production of any large electrical
effects.
   Exp. 4.—With view to obtain larger effects, another form of cell was
                     a
tried, as shown in <U+FB01>g. 5. The carbon pole    consisted of a thin rod of
                                             C
electric light carbon, mm. diameter and 15 cm. long. It was passed

tube bent at right angles was passed through the same cork, to serve
for the delivery of the chlorine. The end of the carbon rod was a
little short (about     mm.) of the end of the porcelain tube.

The conductor from the lead was an iron wire, protected from the
action of the electrolyte by a surrounding porcelain tube. The electro
lyte was chloride of lead. The whole was arranged as shown in <U+FB01>g.       5.
When the chlorine issued from the porcelain tube, the necessary con
ditions for depolarisation were in  a   large degree realised, the contact
between the electrolyte    and the carbon  being at times almost broken,

 round the carbon, these conditions following in rapid alternation.
 The highest E.M.F.'observed was 1'25 volt. The largest current given
 was 0'9 ampere with a P.D. of 0'25 volt.    The current was <U+FB02>uctuat
 ing, owing to the varying conditions at the carbon pole.
   Exp. 5.—The following <U+FB01>gure shows a construction almost identical
 with the last, di<U+FB01>ering only in a few practical details, occasioned by
this cell being made larger than the last. The porcelain tube pre
viously used was replaced by an inverted porcelain crucible, having
two holes drilled in the bottom; the larger hole a<U+FB02>’orded a passage
for the conductor from the carbon pole : through the Smaller one
there passed a porcelain pipe for the chlorine supply.      The carbon
pole was composed of a disc of gas retort carbon, pierced with holes,
as shown in the <U+FB01>gure.    In the middle of the disc was screwed a tube
of carbon, which passed up through the larger hole in the bottom of
the crucible and was secured in this position by nuts of retort carbon.
The bottom of the carbon tube was <U+FB01>lled with fused lead, into which
dipped a thick copper wire that formed the positive pole connexion.

 The connexions between the carbon and porcelain were luted with a.
mixture of borax and <U+FB01>re-clay fused at a bright red heat.     The other
vessel consisted of a short  cylindrical plumbago crucible. The fused
lead was, as usual, on the bottom, connexion being made with         by           it
means of  a  heavy open iron ring, with its free end turned up and bent
over the rim of the crucible.       The internal resistance was small,
owing  to the  improved   contact  of the leading wire with the carbon

pole. The electrolyte was fused PbCIQ.                The whole was heated in a
gas furnace.        When the electrolyte was fused, the chlorine was passed
rapidly through, so that it issued from under the porcelain crucible.
The               was then between 0'94: and 096 volt., and never rose
higher    than    0'98 volt.     The lower E.M.F. was evidently due to the
fact that part of      the   surface of the carbon pole was not subject to the
action of the chlorine, but remained polarised by deposition of lead.
The behaviour was much like that of a constant cell with an E.M.F.
of between 0941 and 0'96 volt. The method of observation was to
alter the exterior resistance and then read the current and P_D., then
break the circuit and read the E.M.F.

    From these observations it will be seen that the internal resistance
was calculated, col. 3, in order to <U+FB01>nd whether polarisation is greatest
when a small or large current is taken from the cell. From the
results it is apparent that the internal resistance, and at the same
time the polarisation, decrease when the current increases. This kind
of cell, therefore, diifers from those in which aqueous electrolytes are
used, inasmuch as the polarisation decreases with increased electrical
output.       The observations of RD. and E.M.F. were taken almost
simultaneously, and the variation of resistance as the gas bubbles
passed out was thus avoided.              As the internal resistance was very
 small the whole time, and remained almost constant during a varia
 tion of the current from 1'26 to 2‘5 ampéres, it may be said to be a
 constant battery, with an                    lower than the theoretical value.
 The reason of this lower E.M.F. is probably due to some part of the
 large carbon plate being covered with reduced lead, thus forming an
 opposing couple of Smaller capacity and lower resistance than the
 primary elements, its e<U+FB01>ect being to reduce the main current. The
 E.M.F. of this opposing couple is of necessity the same as that of the
 main current, but, owing to its lower internal resistance, its P.D. is
 less; if it were not so, the cell would yield no appreciable current.
 This reasoning explains why the results obtained with small cells
 were better than those obtained with large ones.

VII.   “ Measurements of the Absolute Speci<U+FB01>c Resistance of Pure
      Electrolytic Copper.”        By J. W. SWAN and J. RHODIN.
       Communicated by Lord RAYLEIGH, Sec. RS.                 Received
       February 28, 1894.
   At the beginning of    1893 it was resolved to make some very careful
measurements     of the speci<U+FB01>c resistance of pure electrolytic copper,
drawn into wire without previous fusion. Researches made during
the latter end of 1892 had shown that the speci<U+FB01>c resistance of
electrolytic copper varies considerably.       The resistance of about
 thirty wires of the same length and diameter, made from specimens
 of electrolytic copper, prepared in di<U+FB01>erent ways in the laboratory,
 showed differences of resistance amounting to a maximum of 1'41 per
 cent, both when in a hard and when in a soft or annealed state, and
measured at the same temperature.
    These preliminary measurements were made by means of a Wheat
 stone’s bridge, constructed for comparing the unknown resistances of
 short well-conducting wires with the resistance of a standardised
 platinoid wire, according to Thomson’s method.        The accuracy ob
 tainable by this method was 0'25 per cent.       The best specimens of
 wire were subjected to a further and still more accurate examination.
    The measurements of the speci<U+FB01>c resistance and temperature co
 e<U+FB01>cient of one of these wires, and of some wire made from the same
 copper, after undergoing a second electrolytic re<U+FB01>ning, form the
 subject of this paper.    It was resolved to make measurements giving
 an ultimate accuracy of 0'1 per cent. As they were intended to be
 absolute, the <U+FB01>rst problem was the determination of the exact
 dimensions of the wires to be measured.        The measurement of the
 length was made by means of direct comparison with a standard
 metre rule; that of the diameter was determined by the speci<U+FB01>c
 gravity method, which consists in <U+FB01>nding the absolute weight of a
 known length of wire and its density or unit volume weight as
 determined from its speci<U+FB01>c gravity, and then calculating its average
 diameter.

     In the determination   of the speci<U+FB01>c gravity, both the hydrostatic
  balance method and the picnometer method were used. The latter
_ method was found to give more accurate results. A point of great
  importance was the estimation of the temperature of the specimens
  during measurement.      To obtain as great accuracy as possible in the
  temperature readings, an apparatus similar to a calorimeter was
  employed for enclosing the coil of wire whilst it was measured.       A
  standard thermometer divided in tenths of degrees centigrade was
  used, placed in the vessel containing the sample of wire. It was read
  at a distance by means of a telescope.
     The arrangement is represented by <U+FB01>g. 1. It consists of three

weight, W, was used. The coil to be measured was enclosed in com
partment 3. This compartment was closed at the top by a hollow lid
of tinned iron, pierced with holes to allow for the passage of the
stirring rods, &c. This lid effectually protected the paraf<U+FB01>n oil from
surface cooling. The two holes,         and
                                          h     made to allow the wires

to prevent contact with the metal of the lid. The thermometer, T,

the e<U+FB01>fectiveuess of the  arrangement,  it may be mentioned  that a small
Bunsen burner when burning at its full power, and placed under

hours, notwithstanding the temperature of the laboratory was only
15° C.
   Another important detail was an arrangement for securing the
wires whilst they were measured.     Fig. represents this. It consists
                                                2
of a piece of ebonite tube cm. diameter, with a deep double screw
                                 5
thread cut on the outside.  It was pierced all over with large holes
                                 '
1  cm. diameter, to allow the paraf<U+FB01>n oil to freely circulate in the
inside, where the thermometer was inserted. A short rod of ebonite
(p) was put through and. across the cylinder at the bottom. The
wire to be measured was bent round this cross rod, so that equal

  1894.]        Speci<U+FB01>c Resistance      of Pure Electrolytic Copper.       67
 lengths were hanging dbwn. The double bent wire was then wound
 up in    the double screw thread, and secured at the top by means of
string; the in<U+FB02>uence of self-induction was thus avoided. Each wire
had four terminals, the main current terminals, and the shunt ter
minals, which were soldered to pieces of stout copper, the distance
between which determined the length of the wire under examination.
These reels saved the wires from being hardened or otherwise in
jured. The length of the wire was taken both before and after the
electrical measurement.            In some earlier experiments when mica
strips     were   used  for  coiling the wire upon, great di<U+FB01>erences were
observed. When the ebonite reels were employed hardly any di<U+FB01>er
ence could be observed.
     The electrical measurements were made by the fall of potential
method, re<U+FB01>ned as much as is possible.             A D’Arsonval galvanometer
was employed as an indicator of potential difference. The “dead
        ”
beat       property of this instrument is an advantage which in this
class of measurement           cannot be over-rated. Finding in the <U+FB01>rst
experiments with the D’Arsonval galvanometer, that its sensitive
ness was not suf<U+FB01>cient for our purpose, the upper suspension was
lengthened very considerably.             The coil was made to hang on the
upper      wire, the  wire  below   the  coil being left slack. By this means
the required degree of sensitiveness was obtained. The galvanometer
readings were made by means of a telescope and scale, a plane mirror
being attached to the galvanometer coil. To gain the advantage of
using very small de<U+FB02>ections, the scale and galvanometer were widely
separated, the distance between them was 8 m. “The largest de<U+FB02>ec
tions used were 600 divisions of the scale (each division = 1/30 in.),
corresponding to (at that distance from the mirror) an angle of
1° 49', which falls within the limits for :—
     (1.)        tan  2 angle  =    2 tan angle iO'OOl x2 tan angle.
     The readings of the       de<U+FB02>ections were found to be proportional to
the RD. by         direct   and carefully made measurements,        they were
always read in two directions, and the sum taken as the de<U+FB02>ection ;
the accuracy was thus doubled, and possible error by displacement of
the zero point avoided.
     The limit of sensitiveness of the galvanometer was :—
     1 scale division de<U+FB02>ection = 366616666 ampere (approximately), or
 = 000000003101 ampere (accurately).

     The resistance of the suspended coil was 10 ohms. The time re
quired for the coil to come to rest was about two seconds.               The
accompanying diagram shows the arrangement for making the
measurements. They were made by direct comparison between a
standard ohm and the various coils to be measured, and in such a
manner that error due to the resistance of the leads was eliminated.

The following is   a description of the details :——B  was a single lead and
lead peroxide element, of a comparatively large capacity          30 ampere
hours).    It was found necessary to have the capacity           of the  cell
tolerably large to avoid the necessity of making too large corrections
for the fall of potential in the cell itself between diHerent observa
tions. By means of a mercury contact key, K, the battery could be
short-circuited through a nickel wire resistance r (of about 6 ohms),
the standard ohm R and the resistance to be measured X.            All these
resistances were in series.    (The current in the main circuit was only
0'2 or 0‘25 ampere, and did not produce any sensible heating of the
various resistances.)    By means of the current reverser, C (a mercury
switch),  the  current  direction   could be easily changed.     The galva
nometer, G, was connected with another mercury switch, C,, by means
of which it could be put in shunt to the standard ohm and X alter
nately in rapid succession.     In the galvanometer circuit the resist
ance box, RB, was inserted in order to render it possible to make the
de<U+FB02>ections nearly equal when X di<U+FB01>crcd considerably from R.

   The method of making a determination was as follows z—lst, C,
was placed in the position which made the galvanometer circuit a
shunt of the standard ohm. RB was adjusted so as to make the de
<U+FB02>ection of a convenient amount by placing in a resistance R, (R,
having been determined by means of preliminary experiments). Then
K was pressed down        and a de<U+FB02>ection of the galvanometer “ a, ” ob
served.      The current was then reversed, and a de<U+FB02>ection “ b ”
observed.      (a-l-b) was then placed in the observation table under the
heading GR. The key opened.            The temperature of R observed and
noted (TR). 2nd, C1 was then placed in the position which made the
galvanometer circuit a shunt to X. RB adjusted to make the
de<U+FB02>ections of a suitable size by putting in a total resistance of RX
(determined by previous experiment).          Then K was pressed down,
and the de<U+FB02>ection a, observed, the current was then reversed, and a
de<U+FB02>ection b1 observed. (a1+b1) was then put'down in the table under
the heading GX. The temperature of X observed and noted (TX).

   A   set of measurements like these were made in. 20 seconds, thanks
to the dead-beat quality of the galvanometer, and the easy manipula
tion of the mercury switches. It is evident that, if the galoanometer
de<U+FB02>ections were exactly pmportional to the current, and if the resistance
of the galoanometer circuit was su<U+FB01>lciently high to be neglected, and also
if the potential di<U+FB01>erence of the accumulator did not alter between
observations 1 and 2, the resistance X can be put
       .

   The proportionality of the galvanometer           de<U+FB02>ections   with the
limited range employed was, as previously           stated,  experimentally
proved.      The conductivity of the galvanometer as a shunt was
negligible, as is evident from the fact that it was more than 2000
ohms resistance (when a minimum), and then diminished the total
resistance of the main circuit about 1/8000 ohm (it was shunted
 round ;} ohm), the resistance of the main circuit amounting to 8
ohms. The fall of potential of the accumulator was very seldom
appreciable during one set of measurements.         This will be seen from
 the identity between observations 1 and 3 and 2 and 4 respectively in
 the tables.     When appreciable a correction was applied. When all
 the arrangements were completed, a determination of the speci<U+FB01>c
 resistance of the best specimen of copper (marked “A”) was
 made.

tank from ordinary sulphate of copper solution prepared from pure
crystallised sulphate of copper, pure sulphuric acid, and distilled
water. The anode was a large plate of ordinary commercial electro
lytic copper, and the cathode was a large polished plate of rolled
copper. Before placing the cathode in the bath it was silvered by
rubbing it over with a solution of cyanide of silver in potassium
cyanide. This coating of silver was converted into iodide of silver
by means of a solution of iodine in potassium iodide. As is well
known, this treatment renders the stripping of the deposit from the
cathode an easy matter. On this cathode copper was deposited to a
thickness of 2'5 mm., and then the deposit was stripped 011'. Several
deposits were made and tested roughly, as stated in the beginning of
this paper. The best of them was one marked “ A.”
   Preparation of the Wire—A strip was cut from the‘deposited sheet
of copper, <U+FB01>led round, and then drawn through sapphire dies to a
diameter of approximately 002 in.
   These determinations were made by means of the hydrostatic
balance principle.        A re-determination of the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the
copper       I in the above table was made by means of a picnometer.

    As is seen from the above numbers, the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of copper
 when it is pure varies very little with hardness and other conditions,
 the variations when at a maximum only amounting to 00004 of the
 whole. The mean of the above results may, therefore, be taken as
the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of this copper at 15° C. The mean is
                          89511 = the speci<U+FB01>c gravity.
    This value is not the      one required for the calculation of the dimen
 sion of wires ;     what  is required is the density or absolute weight of
an ideal cubic centimetre of the metal at 15° C. The weight of
 1 0.0. of water at 15° C. is, according to Kohlrausch,           ‘Praktische
 Physik,’

    The speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the copper divided by this <U+FB01>gure gives the
 density :—

placed in the circuit.  A large number of observations were made at

are the headings of the columns :—Tx = temperature of the unknown
resistance; GrX = de<U+FB02>ection (proportional to the current) with the
unknown resistance ; G3 = de<U+FB02>ection when standard ohm in circuit;
TR = temperature of standard ohm; Gx = de<U+FB02>ection of unknown
resistance (supposing GR to be always 1240); Gx (6th column) is
de<U+FB02>ection with unknown resistance (X) in circuit corrected, so as to
compare with G3 at 1240 and T1, at 15° C. ; the <U+FB01>gures in this column
multiplied by a constant give the resistance of the wire.

to ascertain which values could be used for calculating the temperature
coef<U+FB01>cient (A,), the above observations were plotted in the usual way,
the co-ordinates being a: = temperature and y = speci<U+FB01>c resistance
in C.G.S. units.
   As previously stated, the values in column 6 of Table        II have to be
multiplied by     1'6906  to  give   the speci<U+FB01>c  resistance in C.G.S. units;
to save labour the multiplication was done graphically (Graphic
Table No. l).
   The resistances in column 6 of Table         I  reduced to C.G.S. units by
means of the graphical Table 1 are tabulated in another table
(Table    III).
   The graphic Table No. 2 is a reproduction of Table III, and gives
the results of the above measurements.
   As the values formed so very nearly a straight line, two only are
selected :—
                                                                             .

                         1937     ,,      ,,      512° C.
   These gave the following equations :—
                         1707   = w(l+16y)
                         1937   = w(1+5l'2y), from which

   .7: is the speci<U+FB01>c resistance of the A deposit (hard drawn) at 0° (1.,
and y is the temperature coef<U+FB01>cient.          By means of these values an
extrapolation    was  made   from   0° to 16° C. in the graphic Table No.

    Applying this value of a: to the amount of speci<U+FB01>c resistance at
168° C., the following is obtained as the speci<U+FB01>c resistance of this
special sample of annealed rocking tank A deposit :—

 Speci<U+FB01>c Resistance of Soft Annealed Copper Wire made from De
   posited Sheet Copper named B, the Deposit being obtained from. a
    Solution of Rocking Tank A Copper Dissolved in Pure Diluted
    Sulphuric Acid, using an Anode of the Tank                Copper.
    Origin of     the    Coppen—A solution of sulphate of copper was pre
pared by using a piece of rocking tank A copper, as the anode in a

80          Specific Resistance of Pure Electrolytic Copper.                  [May 24,
mixture of pure sulphuric acid and distilled water, the cathode being
another strip of copper enclosed in a new and clean cell of porous
earthenware.        The current was continued until the solution had the
desired strength. From this solution a sheet of copper was deposited
on a polished copper plate, as described in the <U+FB01>rst part of this paper,
the rocking tank A copper still being the anode.                       The deposit was
then cut into narrow strips and drawn through sapphire dies to the
requisite diameter.          It was   <U+FB01>nally annealed        by heating    in a current
of CO;     gas.
   Speci<U+FB01>c     Gravity of Ike Copper B.—It was ascertained by weighing
equal lengths of this wire and sample A (both drawn through the
same die), that their speci<U+FB01>c gravities did not di<U+FB01>er to any appreciable
amount, the density 8959 at 15° C. was therefore taken for this
sample B.
   Diameter of the Wire—300 cm. of the wire weighed 5'5845 grams;

    To ascertain the speci<U+FB01>c resistance in C.G.S. units, the constant by
 which to multiply 986 (last column, Table V) was calculated in the
 same manner as in Equation N0. 7, and by substituting 0025717 for 1'
 instead of 0025755, the constant 16856 is obtained. We thus have
 the speci<U+FB01>c resistance of the pure copper :—
                  015.99‘;_ = 986x    1'6856    =   1662 C.G.S. units.
    Measurements at higher temperatures for ascertaining the tempera
 ture coe<U+FB02>icient were made, but the data were unfortunately lost. The
 result, however, was
                                      A; = 0004115.

    §1. That air       can be electri<U+FB01>ed either positively              or negatively
 is obvious    from     the  fact that    an   isolated     spherule   of  pure water,
electri<U+FB01>ed either positively or negatively, can be wholly evaporated
 in air?“      Thirty-four years ago it was pointed out by one of
   * This demonstrates an af<U+FB01>rmative answer to the question, Can a molecule of a
gas be charged with electricity? (J.   J. Thomson,

and Magnetism,’ § 36, p. 53)    and  shows  that  the   experiments referred to as point
ing to the opposite conclusion are to be explained otherwise.

   Since this was Written, we <U+FB01>nd, in the Electrical Review       of May 18, on page 571,
in a lecture by Elihu Thomson, the following :—“ It is known that as we leave the

us“ as probable that in ordinary natural atmospheric conditions, the
air for    some considerable height above the earth’s surface is electri
<U+FB01>ed,T and that the incessant variations of electrostatic force which he
had observed, minute after minute, during calms and light winds, and
often under a cloudless sky, were due to motions of large quantities
of positively or negatively electri<U+FB01>ed air in the immediate ne‘igh
bourhood of the place of observation.
     § 2. It was proved}; by observations in the Old College of Glasgow
University that the air was in general negatively electri<U+FB01>ed, not only
indoors, within the old lecture room§ of Natural Philosophy, but
also in the out-of-doors space of the College Court, open to the
sky though closed around with high buildings, and between it and
the top of the College Tower.                  The Old College was in a somewhat
low situation, surrounded by a densely crowded part of a great city.
In the new University buildings, crowning a hill on the western
boundary of Glasgow, similar phenomena, though with less general
with respect to the ground.        .   .  .   .  It is not clearly proven that a pure gas,
rare<U+FB01>ed or not, can receive and convey a charge.         If we imagine a charged dr0p of
 water suspended in air and evaporating, it follows that, unless the charge be carried
off in the vapour, the potential of the drop would rise steadily as its surface dimin
ished, and would become in<U+FB01>nite as the drop disappeared, unless the charge were
dissipated   before the complete drying up of the drop by dispersion of the drop itself,
or conveyance of electricity by its vapour. The charge would certainly require to
pass somewhere, and might leave the air and vapour charged.”
   It is quite clear that “must " ought to be substituted for “ might ” in this last
line. Thus the vagueness and doubts expressed in the <U+FB01>rst part of the quoted
statement are annulled by the last three sentences of it.
   "' “ Even in fair
                      weather the intensity of the electric force in the air near the
earth’s   surface  is perpetually    <U+FB02>uctuating.    The speaker had often observed it,
especially   during calms or very light breezes from the east, varying from 40
Daniell’s elements per foot to three or four times that amount during a few minutes,
and returning again as rapidly to the lower amount.               More frequently he had
observed variations from about 30 to about 40, and back again, recurring in uncer
tain periods of perhaps about two minutes.          These gradual variations cannot but
be produced by electri<U+FB01>ed masses of air or cloud, <U+FB02>oating by the locality of observa
tion.”—Lord Kelvin’s ‘ Electrostatics and Magnetism,’ art. xvi, § 282.
   1' The out-of-doors    air potential, as tested by a portable electrometer in an open
place, or even by a water-dropping       nozzle outside, two or three feet from the walls
of the lecture room, was generally on these occasions positive, and the earth’s
surface itself therefore, of course, negative—the common fair weather condition—
        I
which am forced to conclude is due to a paramount in<U+FB02>uence of positive elec
tricity in higher regions of the air, notwithstanding the negative electricity of the
air in the lower stratum near the earth’s surface.          On the two or three occasions
when the in-docr atmospheric electricity was found positive, and, therefore, the
surface of the <U+FB02>oor, walls and ceiling negative, the potential outside was certainly
positive, and the earth’s surface out-of-doors negative, as usual in <U+FB01>ne weather.”—

 prevalence of negative electricity in the air, have been observed,
 both indoors, in the large Bute Hall, and in many other smaller
 rooms, and out-of-doors, in the court, which is somewhat similar to
  the courts of the Old College, but much larger. It is possible that
 the negative electricity found thirty years ago in the air of the Old
  College, may have been due to its situation, surrounded by houses
 with their <U+FB01>res, and smoking factory chimneys. In the New College
 much of the prevalence of negative electricity in air within doors
 has, however, been found to be due to electri<U+FB01>cation by the burning
 lampa used with the quadrant electrometer; and more recent obser
vations, with electri<U+FB01>cation by <U+FB02>ame absolutely excluded, throw doubt
on the old conclusion, that both in town and country negative
electri<U+FB01>cation is the prevailing condition of natural atmospheric air
in the lower regions of the atmosphere.
     §3. The electric ventilation found in the Old College, and de
scribed in §299 of “Electrostatics             and Magnetism," according to
which air drawn through a chink, less than § in. wide, of a slightly
open window or door, into a large room, showed the electri<U+FB01>cation
which it had on the other side of the chink, whether that was the
natural electri<U+FB01>cation of the open air, or positive or negative electri
<U+FB01>cation produced by aid of a spirit lamp and electric machine in an
adjoining room, has been tried again in the new College with quite
corresponding results. It has also been extended to the drawing in
of electri<U+FB01>ed air through a tube to the enclosure represented in <U+FB01>g. 1
of the present paper; with the result that the water-dropping test
indicated in the sketch, amply suf<U+FB01>ced to show the electri<U+FB01>cation,
and verify that it was always the same as that of the air outside.
When the tube was <U+FB01>lled with loosely packed cotton-wool the electri~
<U+FB01>cation of the entering air was so nearly annulled as to be insensible
to the test.
     §4. The object proposed for the experiments described in the
present communication was to <U+FB01>nd if a small unchanged portion of
air could be electri<U+FB01>ed su<U+FB01>iciently to show its electri<U+FB01>cation by
ordinary tests, and could keep its electri<U+FB01>cation for any considerable
time; and to test whether or not dust in the air is essential to what
ever of electri<U+FB01>cation might be observed in such circumstances, or is
much concerned in it.

gram, Fig.. 1. AA is a large sheet-iron vat inverted on a large
wooden tray BB, lined with lead.              By <U+FB01>lling the tray with water the

one for the water-dropper C, and one for the charging wire D.
Both the water-dropper, and the charging wire, ending with a pin
point as sharp as possible, are insulated by solid paraf<U+FB01>n, which is
surrounded by a metal tube, as shown in half size in Fig. 2. To
start with they were supported by pieces of vulcanite embedded in
paraf<U+FB01>n. But it was found that after the lapse of some days,
(possibly on account of ozone generated by the incessant brush dis
charges), the insulation had utterly failed in both of them. The
vulcanite pieces were then taken out, and solid para<U+FB02>in, with the
metal guard-tube round it to screen it from electrically in<U+FB02>uencing
the water-dropper, was substituted.       This has proved quite satis
factory:  the water-dropper,  with  the  <U+FB02>ow  of water stopped, holds a
positive or a negative charge for hours.
                                                    “ Electrostatics and
   § 6. A quadrant electrometer E (described in
Magnetism,”       346—353) was set up on the top of the vat near the
water-dropper, as shown in Fig. 1. It was used with lamp and semi
transparent scale to indicate the difference of potential between the
water-dropper and the vat. The sensibility of the electrometer was
21 scale divisions (half-millimetres) per volt, and as the scale was
90 centimetres long, difference of potentials up to 43 volts positive or
negative, could be read by adjusting the metallic zero to the middle
of the scale. A frictional plate-electric machine was used, and by
means of it, in connection with the pin-point, the air inside the vat
could be electri<U+FB01>ed either positively or negatively.
   § 7. The vat was <U+FB01>xed in position in the Apparatus Room of the
Natural Philosophy Department of the University of Glasgow on
the 13th of December, 1893, and for more than three months the air
inside was left undisturbed except by discharges from the pin-point
through the electrifying wire, and by the spray from the water
dropper. Thus the air was becoming more and more freed of dust
day by day.    Yet at the end of the four months we found that the
air was as easily electri<U+FB01>ed, either positively or negatively, as it was
at the beginning; and that if we electrify it strongly by turning the
machine for half-an-hour, it retains a considerable portion of this
electri<U+FB01>cation for several hours.
   § 8. Observations were taken almost daily since the 13th Decem
ber; but the following, taken on the 8th of February, the 12th of
March, and the 23rd of April, will serve as specimens, the results
being shown in each case by a curve.          At all these dates the air
must have been very free from dust.       Both during the charging and
during the observations the case of the electrometer and one pair of
quadrants are kept metallically connected to the vat.         During the
charging the water-dropper and the other pair of quadrants were also
kept in connection with the vat.       Immediately after the charging
was stopped the charging~wire was connected metallically to the out

make sure that     was charging negatively; and a similar test when

and the reading 70 seconds after the machine stapped turning is the

tive electri<U+FB01>cation; though the quantity received from the machine
was probably less in the ease of the negative electri<U+FB01>cation, because
the negative conductor was less well insulated than the positive.
  §  10. On the 21st of March, two U-tubes were put in below the
edge of the vat, one on either side, so that     might be possible to                     it
blow dusty, or smoky, or dustless air into the vat. To one tube was
<U+FB01>tted a blowpipe bellows, and by placing       on the top of a box in                it
which brown paper and rosin were burning, the vat was <U+FB01>lled with
smoky air.    Again, several layers of cottOn-wool were placed on the
month of the bellows, so as to get dustless air into the vat. The
bellows were worked for several hours on four successive days, and
we found no appreciable di<U+FB01>erence (1) in the ease with which the
air could be electri<U+FB01>ed by discharges from the wire connected to
the electric machine, and (2) in the length of time the air retains its
electri<U+FB01>cation.

      But it was found that, as had been observed four years ago with
' the same apparatus,‘ with the water-dropper insulated and connected
  to the electrometer, and no electri<U+FB01>cation of any kind to begin with,
  a negative electri<U+FB01>cation amounting to four, <U+FB01>ve. or six volts gradu
  ally supcrvened if the water-dropper was kept running for 60 or 70
  minutes, through air which was dusty, or natural, to begin with.              It
  was also found, as in the observations of four years ago, that
  no electri<U+FB01>cation of this kind was produced by the dropping of the
  water through air puri<U+FB01>ed of dust.
      The circular bend of the tube of the water-dropper shown in the
  drawing was made for the purpose of acting as a trap to prevent the
  natural dusty air of the locality from entering the vat when the
  water-dropper ran empty.
      § 11. The equilibrium of electri<U+FB01>ed air within a space enclosed by a
  <U+FB01>xed bounding surface of conducting material presents an interesting
  illustration of elementary hydrostatic principles.           The condition to
  be ful<U+FB01>lled is simply that the surfaces of equal electric “volume
            ”
  density      are surfaces of equal potential, if we assume that the
  material density of the air at given temperature and pressure is not
  altered by electri<U+FB01>cation. This assumption we temporarily make from
  want of knowledge; but it is quite possible that experiment may prove
  that it is not accurately true; and it is to be hoped that experimental
  investigation will be made for answering this very interesting question.
      § 12. For stable equilibrium it is further            necessary    that the
  electric density, if not uniform throughout, diminishes from the
  bounding surface inwards.          Hence, if there is a portion of non
  electri<U+FB01>ed air in the enclosure it must be wholly surrounded by
  electri<U+FB01>ed air.
      § 13. We may form some idea of the absolute value of the electric
  density, and of the electrostatic force in di<U+FB01>'erent parts of the enclosure,
  in the electri<U+FB01>cations found in our experiments, by considering instead
  of our vat a spherical enclosure of diameter intermediate between the
  diameter and depth of the vat which we used. Consider, for example,
  a spherical space enclosed in metal of 100 cm. diameter, and let the
  nozzle of the water-dropper be so placed that the stream breaks into
  drops at the centre of the space. The potential shown by the electro
  meter connected with it,'being the di<U+FB02>’erence between the potentials
  of the air at the boundary and at the centre, will be the difference of
  the potentials at the centre due respectively to the total quantity of
  electricity distributed through the air and the equal and opposite
  quantity on the inner boundary of the enclosing metal; and we there
  fore have the formula :—

1894.]                  On the Electri<U+FB01>cation    of Air.                    93v
where    V   denotes the potential indicated by the water-dropper, a the
radius of the spherical hollow, and        p the electric density of the air at
distance 'r from the centre.         Supposing now, for example, ,0 to be
constant from the surface to the centre (which may be nearly the case
after long electri<U+FB01>cation as performed in our experiments), we <U+FB01>nd
V = §1rpa2; whence p = 3V/21ra2.
    To particularise further, suppose the potential to have been
38 volts or 0127 electrostatic c.g.s. (which is less than the greatest
found in our experiments) and take a = 50 cm.: we <U+FB01>nd p = 24.10“.
The electrostatic force at distance r from the centre, being —§-1rp'r, is
therefore equal to 10-41'.         Hence a, small body electri<U+FB01>ed with a
quantity of electricity equal to that possessed by a cubic centimetre
of the air, and placed midway          ('r  = 25) between the surface and
centre of the enclosure experiences a force equal to 2'4.10-°.25, or
6.10—5, or approximately 6.10“ grammes weight.            This is  4'8 per cent.
of the force of gravity on cubic centimetre of air of density 1/800.
                                a
  §    14. Hence we see that, on the supposition of electric density
uniform throughout the spherical enclosure, each cubic centimetre of
air experiences an electrostatic force towards the boundary in simple
proportion to distance from the centre, and amounting at the bound
ary to nearly 10 per cent. of the force of gravity upon it; and electric
forces of not very dissimilar magnitudes must have acted on the air
electri<U+FB01>ed as it actually was in the non~spherical enclosure used in
  our experiments. If natural air or cloud, close to the ground or in
 the lower regions of the earth’s atmosphere,         is   ever, as in all pro-
 bability   itoften  is, electri<U+FB01>ed to  as great
                                               a   degree of electric density
 as we have found     it  within  our  experimental vat, the natural electro
 static force in the atmosphere, due as it is, no doubt, to positive elec.
 tricity in very high regions, must exercise an important pondero
motive force quite comparable in magnitude with that due to
 difference of temperatures in different positions.
    Itis   interesting to remark that negatively electri<U+FB01>ed air over
 negatively electri<U+FB01>ed ground, and with non-electri<U+FB01>ed air above it,
 in an absolute calm, would be in unstable equilibrium; and the nega
 tively electri<U+FB01>ed air would therefore rise, probably in large masses,
 through the non-electri<U+FB01>ed air up to the higher regions, where the
 positive electri<U+FB01>cation   is   supposed to reside.     Even with no stronger
 electri<U+FB01>cation than that which we have had within our experimental
 vat, the moving forces would be suf<U+FB01>cient to produce instability com
 parable with that of air warmed by the ground and rising through
colder air above.
  §   15.    During              the electri<U+FB01>cation of air, or of air
                      a thunderstorm

stronger than that found in our experiments. This we see by con.

deusit y, reckoned according to the total electricity in any small volume
(electricity of air and of spherules of water, if there are any in it),
would produce a di<U+FB01>erence of potential of 38 million volts between
its surface and centre.          In a thunderstorm, <U+FB02>ashes of lightning show
us di<U+FB01>erences of potentials of millions of volts, but not perhaps of
many times 38 million volts, between places of the atmosphere distant
from one another by half a kilometre.
II. “On       the Effect of Magnetisation           upon the Dimensions of
        Iron Rings in Directions perpendicular to the Maguetisa
       tion, and upon the Volume of the Rings.”                     By SHELFORD
        BIDWELL, M.A., LL.B., F.R.S.              Received March 2, 1894.
    A recent communication“ to the Society contained an account of
some experiments relating to the effects of magnetisation upon the
dimensions of two iron rings, one of which was annealed and the
other hardened.         The rings had the form of short cylinders about
6 cm. in diameter, 3 cm. in height, and 0'41 cm. in thickness. The
experiments in question were concerned with the circumferential
variations which took place along the lines of magnetisation; those
to be here described deal with the concomitant variations in the
height of the cylinders (width of the rings) transversely to the mag
netisation. On the assumption that variations similar to the latter
occur at the same time in the thickness of the metal, it is possible to
deduce the changes in the volume of the ring which attend magnet
 isation.
    Fig. 1, from a photograph, shows how the rings were prepared for
 the experiments. Four brass rods were hard-soldered t0 the iron,
two of them being in a line with a diameter, while the other two were
attached to the edges, opposite to one another, and parallel to the axis
of the ring. The ring was inserted in a wooden case, also shown,
through holes in which the four brass rods projected. Insulated
 wire for carrying the magnetising current was wound over the wooden
jacket.
    For the new experiments the ring            was placed in a horizontal posi
 tion, one of the edge rods resting upon a brass socket on the adjust
 able base of the instrument, and the other, which had a chisel-shaped
 end, actuating the lever.'l'        To counterbalance the weight of the ring
 a horizontal arm, carrying           a sliding weight, was <U+FB01>xed to the lower
\rod.

7 ten-millionths, a result which agrees very well with that obtained
by myself for the same small magnetising force.
   As was shown in my last paper, the eifects along the lines of mag
netisation are very di<U+FB02>‘erent in the two rings.     The annealed ring
(Ring I) begins to contract circumferentially with the smallest
forces, and continues to contract with the large ones ; while the
hardened ring expands with small forces and contracts with large
ones.   These effects are indicated in the <U+FB01>gure by the dotted curves.
   By combining the results of the old and of the new experiments we
can ascertain the nature of the changes produced by magnetisation
in the volumes of the rings.

     The behaviour of this latter ring may be regarded as probably
 similar to that of the great majority of rods and rings, the annealed
 ring used‘in these experiments being the only specimen of iron that
 has yet been found to contract along the lines of magnetisation with
 the smallest forces that produced any effect at all.
     Experiments upon the volume changes produced by magnetisation
 have been previously made by Joule, Barrett, and Knott.
     J0ule* concluded that the volume of an iron bar was altogether
  una<U+FB01>ected by magnetisation, even though the magnetising current
  which he employed “was quite equal to saturate the iron.”                          It was

  that value, an inspection of the curve for unannealed iron in <U+FB01>g. 3

  change of volume.            There is, in fact, none at all with a force of
  about 90 units.

 tained a negative result, perhaps for the same reason.
    Knott’s* experiments were made with hollow iron tubes, 415'7 cm.
in length, 384 cm. in external diameter, and of different bores,
                                             “ Each tube was closed below, and
ranging from 0'7 cm. to 3'19 cm.
into the upper end a nut screwed tightly, through a perforation in
which issued a <U+FB01>ne capillary glass tube. The nut was adjusted under
water, so that the whole of the interior space of the metal tube was
<U+FB01>lled with liquid, and also part of the glass tube. When the tube
was set vertically in the heart of the magnetising coil, the changes of
volume were measured by the motions of the liquid meniscus in the
capillary tube.” “A few experiments were made on the external
change of volume of a few of the tubes, which were enclosed in a
thin-walled brass tube. The brass tube yielded because of its thin
ness, so that the results were not certain. But there was no doubt
that with the specimens of iron tried there were large changes of
volume.”
    The changes observed by Knott in the interior volume appear in
the case of a, tube of large bore to have been of the same nature as
those in my unannealed ring; while with a tube of smaller bore they
rather resembled the changes exhibited by the annealed ring. His
published investigations are, however, only of a preliminary character,
and it is not at present possible to make a satisfactory comparison
between his results and my own.                But he was undoubtedly the <U+FB01>rst
to show that magnetisation is generally attended by considerable
changes of volume.

connexion consisted of eleven circuits all connected to one machine.
    The pressure in the alternating circuit was rather greater than
 1000 volts, and about half this pressure was indicated by an electro
 static voltmeter between M, and earth throughout the experiments.

consisting of a pencil of graphite mixed with clay or cement and
 connected to the water-pipes and to the main M1, was then tried.
    This produced no effect on the de<U+FB02>ections without a battery, but
slightly increased the de<U+FB02>ection with a battery and with all mains
 connected.
    When tried 011 the trunk main alone with the lamps removed,

increased from about 23 to 360.

produced when the circuit was completed through the resistance of
103,360 ohms in place of the mains and earth ; this gives an indica—
tion of the sensibility of the arrangement.
   The explanation of the results obtained appears to be that when
the cables are charged with positive electricity the polarisation
produced is suf<U+FB01>cient during the time of one alternation to con
siderably increase the resistance of the slight'leakage to earth by

IV.   “The Effect of Mechanical Stress and of Magnetisation on
      the Physical Properties of Alloys of Iron and Nickel and of
      Manganese Steel.”    By HERBERT TOMLINSON, B.A.. F.R.S.
      Received May            7,   1894.
                                           (Abstract)
    The author has examined the principal physical properties of three
alloys of nickel with iron and of the non-magnetic manganese steel
of Mr. Had<U+FB01>eld, together with the effects of mechanical stress and
magnetisation on these properties. The three nickel-iron alloys con
tain 22, 25, and 30 per cent. of nickel, and are designated Specimens
D, E, and  F    respectively; they are in the form of thin wires, and
similar specimens have been previously tested by Dr. John Hopkinson
for the effect of change of temperature on their magnetic pro
perties<U+FB01>“   Specimen     practically loses its magnetic susceptibility at
                          F

temperature of the room.      Specimens D and       are magnetic in the

hard-drawn condition, but become non-magnetic when heated above
600° 0.    They do not, however, like Specimen F, regain their mag
netic susceptibility when cooled to the ordinary temperature of the
room, but can be made to do so, either by the process of wire-drawing,
or by cooling them a few degrees below 0° C. Tables and‘II contain   I
the values of the principal physical constants of the three nickel-iron
alloys, of Had<U+FB01>eld’s non-magnetic manganese steel, and of nickel and
iron.    The former of these two tables relates to the substances in the
hard-drawn condition in which they were received by the author,
and the latter to the same substances after annealing, so that by a
comparison of the two tables, the effects of the permanent strain
resulting from wire-drawing may be seen. These effects are in some
instances of the same nature for the nickel-iron alloys as for nickel
 and iron.    Thus the density of all the specimens       diminished by
                                                                     is

wire-drawing, the simple rigidity is also diminished, and the internal
molecular friction, as inferred from the logarithmic decrement of arc
of torsionally Oscillating wires, is considerably increased. On the
contrary, whilst the speci<U+FB01>c resistance of iron, nickel, and man
ganese steel is increased by wire-drawing, that of the iron-nickel alloys
is largely diminished. Again, whilst wire-drawing largely decreases
the magnetic permeability of iron, nickel, and iron alloyed with
30 per cent. of nickel, it makes the alloys containing 22 and 25 per
cent. of nickel to considerably appreciate in permeability, and, in
fact, in a great measure transforms them from the almost non-magnetic
to the magnetic condition. Dr. John Hopkinson has shown that a
similar result can be obtained by cooling the alloys several degrees
below 0°C. The magnetic properties of manganese steel cannot,
however, be restored by the process of wire~drawing.

eifects of stress or strain on these properties, all the nickel-iron alloys
here examined have considerably less longitudinal and torsional
elasticity than the pure metals nickel and iron; they also have con
siderably less internal friction.       This last is very conspicuously
the case with the alloys containing 25 per cent. nickel, which in
the annealed non-magnetic condition has an internal molecular
friction less than one-fourth of that of iron or nickel. For mag
netising forces extending from 0'8 to 2 C.G.S. units, the alloy con
taining 30 per cent. of nickel is possessed of much greater magnetic
permeability than iron, but for large forces the iron is superior.     The
other two nickel-iron alloys are, when in the annealed condition,
almost as non-magnetic as Had<U+FB01>eld’s manganese steel.
   The temporary effects of longitudinal mechanical traction and
magnetic stress on some of the physical properties are exhibited in
Table III. It will be noticed that longitudinal traction produces on
both the speci<U+FB01>c resistance and the thermo-electric height of the
alloys of nickel with iron, an effect which is intermediate to that pro
duced on the pure metals nickel and iron.         The magnetising forces
employed ranged for the most part between 40 and 80 C.G.S. units,
and the results obtained refer only to the elastic effects of the force,
which effects are approximately proportional to the force itself. These
elastic e<U+FB01>ects are much greater in proportion to the change of mag
netic induction than are the residual effects.       The change of both
speci<U+FB01>c  resistance and thermo-electric  height produced  by a C.G.S. unit
of magnetic stress, is in all cases enormously greater than that pro
duced by a C.G.S. unit of mechanical stress.
   The effects of mechanical stress on the magnetic permeability of
all the different iron-nickel alloys are fully exhibited in this paper.
Speaking roughly, they lie between the corresponding effects for the
pure metals iron and nickel.

 V. “ Propagation      of Magnetisation of Iron as affected         by the
       Electric Currents in the Iron.”        By J. HOPKINSON,      F.R.S.,
       and E. \VILSON.      Received May 17, 1894.
                                 (Abstract)
    Consider a solid, cylindrical electromagnet, it is well known that,
in reversing    the magnetising current, the induction does not instantly
reverse, but a certain time elapses before it again attains its full
value, that it reverses at a later time at the centre of the core than
near its surface, and that the delay in reversal near the centre is due
to the electric currents induced in the iron. The object of the pre
sent paper is to investigate these effects.
    The magnet experimented upon had a diameter of 4 inches, and
formed a closed magnetic circuit.        Through a part of its length the
cylinder of 4 inches diameter was formed of an iron core surrounded
by two concentric, closely <U+FB01>tting tubes.          Exploring coils of <U+FB01>ne
copper wire were bedded in the iron between the surfaces of the tubes.
The currents induced in these exploring coils were observed when the
current in the main coil of the magnet was reversed.         These currents
in some cases last for over half a minute.
    Inferences can be drawn from these results as to the behaviour of
other diameters than 4 inches.        Comparing two cylinders of di<U+FB02>ferent
diameters,     similar events occur, but at times proportional to the
squares of the diameters of the cylinders.        From this consideration
and the experiments, a judgment is formed as to the effects of local
currents in the cores of transformers and of the armatures of dynamo
machines.
VI.    “ On
              Rapid Variations of Atmospheric Temperature, espe
       cially during Fii/m, and the Methods of observing them.”
       By   J.  Y. BUCHANAN, F.R.S.       Received May      29, 1894.
    The variation of the temperature of the air in the course of a day
is a matter of familiar observation. It depends in the <U+FB01>rst instance
on the relative positions of the locality and the sun. The temperature
is generally highest a short time after the sun has attained its greatest
 altidude above the horizon, and it is lowest some time after it has
attained its greatest depression below the horizon. Observations
made at regular intervals over the twenty-four hours show a more
or less regular rise of temperature during the early part of the day
and a similar fall of temperature during the latter part of the day
and the evening. When the interval between the observations is

1894.]        On Rapid Variations    of Atmospheric Temperature.      109
diminished the regularity of the march of temperature is found to
diminish also, but the great variability of the temperature of the
air is  best shown by the curve drawn by a recording thermometer of
su<U+FB01>icient sensibility combined with a clock movement of suitable
velocity.     Such an instrument draws a sinuous line which is generally
smooth during the night and serrated during the day. The shape and
the crowdedness of the teeth on the serrated daylight portion of the line
have a close connection with, and are to a certain extent an indication
of, the character of the existing weather.        In general the indented
character of the daylight curve. is an indication of the disturbing in
<U+FB02>uence of the sun on the equilibrium of the atmosphere which continues
just as long as he is above the horizon; after sunset the atmosphere
quickly reverts to a state of greater stability. It is obvious, there
fore, that the indented character of the daylight curve indicates not
 only changes of temperature in the air but also motions and changes
of motion in it. These motions are generally vertical and too subtle
and local to be observed with an anemometer.            In the course of
frequent observations in the open air and under varying circum
stances,    I  have many times had Occasion to remark these rapid
oscillations of temperature and at the same time to deplore the
dif<U+FB01>culty of accurately measuring them. It is principally with the
view of directing attention to this instrumental di<U+FB02>iculty that the
 following observations are put together. At the same time, though few
 in number, they have to do with a very remarkable species of weather,
 known by its Alpine name of Fohn. It has been most observed
 in the valleys stretching in a northerly direction from the main sum
 mit line of the chain of the Alps and takes the form of an abnor
 mally warm wind blowing from the mountains towards the plain.
 It has largely occupied the attention of continental meteorologists,
 and more particularly it has been the subject of exhaustive investi
 gations by Hann, who has shown by very strong evidence that its
 high temperature must be due to its compression in descending from
 a great altitude.      In the descriptions of the Ftihn, attention is
  almost exclusively directed to the high average temperature of the
  air, and no mention is made of their extraordinary variations,
  although every observer must have noticed them.       They are so great
  as to be recognised at once by the sensations and at the same time so
  rapid as to elude almost every other method of estimation or measure
 ment. It has also,     I believe, not been before remarked that the true
  Fiihn occurs in our own country and with its characteristics quite as
  well marked as in Switzerland. It is sometimes supposed that a. great
  absolute height of mountain chain is required for its production; but
  this is not so. A relative height of 1,000 to 1,200 metres is quite
  suf<U+FB01>cient for its production; and this is equally available on the west
  coast of Scotland and on the northern slopes of the Alps.

 110       Mr.   J. Y. Buchanan.        On  Rapid l'ariationa of      [May 31,
   The observations        were made in the summer of 1893, which was
abnormally      warm   all  over the north of Europe.      In the beginning of
 July   I observed the Fohn at Fort William, and in the latter part of
 August in the upper Engadin, and more particularly in the valley
occupied by the Morteratsch glacier. Besides the observation of the
varying temperature of the air itself, the investigation of the tem
perature gradient set up between the melting ice surface of the
glacier and the hot winds blowing over it presented considerable
interest. The curious fact was observed that while the hot wind was
blowing over the glacier and melting the surface in abundance, the
temperature of the air, as close to the ice as a thermometer could be
applied without touching the ice, was never lower than 55° C.
   In the beginning of July at Fort William the weather was very
warm, and in the midst of the very warm air still hotter blasts made
themselves felt from time to time.             The sensation was much the
same as is produced when, on the deck of a steamer, the air passing
the funnel strikes the face.        These hot blasts lasted only for one or
two seconds, and repeated themselves every minute or two. Their
elfect on a thermometer, freely exposed in the shade, was to keep the
 mercury in a constant state of motion, the temperature rising often
more than 1° C. in a minute, and falling again as much. The thermo
meters in the screens were also a good deal a<U+FB01>ected, though not nearly
to the same extent as the freely exposed ones.          The recording instru
ments, the clock motion of which was not suf<U+FB01>ciently quick to draw
the record out into an indented line, showed a broad band which
measured the amplitude of the excursions of the instrument, though
by no means the amplitude of the oscillations of the temperature of
the air. This phenomenon was particularly observed on the 8th July,
1893, when     I  was employed the greater part of the day in making
evaporation experiments. It was very warm, as the following obser
vations of the thermometers in the large observatory screens will
show :—

   It was during the heat of the day, from 10 A.M. to 2 P.M., that the
hot pu<U+FB01>‘s made themselves most felt; but           I  found it impossible to
measure their temperatures, owing to the thermal inertia of the
thermometers.       The puffs lasted not longer than one or two seconds,

1894.]      Atmospheric Temperature, especially during Fiihn.                   111
and their temperature, to judge by the sensation, was rather higher
than that of the body.               The thermometers had only begun to rise
when the heating ceased, and they fell back again.                       From the
<U+FB01>gures in the above table, it will be seen that the temperature
of the air at noon reached 249° 0., a very high <U+FB01>gure for a station in
nearly 57° north latitude. Along with the great rise of temperature
there is a fall of absolute as well as of relative humidity, indicating
that the air has come from a greater altitude. Attempts to measure
the actual temperatures of the hot puffs gave no satisfactory result.
I  am much obliged to Mr. Omond and the staif of the Fort William
Observatory for          their    courteous     assistance   while   making   these
observations.                      ,
    Later in    the year,    in the middle of August, I visited the upper
Engadin, and stayed          for some weeks at Pontresina. Here, as else
where the weather was very warm, and                      I  was much struck by
observing     the   same   blasts    of hot air as I  had  experienced in Scotland.
The general characteristics of the weather were the same, and the
temperature of the air in the valley rose nearly as high as it had
done at Fort William.
    On the 18th August          I  went for an excursion on the Morteratsch
glacier   with    a  guide.    On      my remarking the hot puffs of air, which
 were much more striking on the ice than on the land, he said it was
the Fdhn, of which he considered them a characteristic. The sun and
 the hot wind were causing an enormous amount of surface melting of
 the ice, and having a thermometer with me, I took the temperature
 of the air by whirling at a height of about 1 m. from the ice, and
 found it 12'O-° C. ; the wet bulb was 5‘O°, so that the vapour tension
 was 2'3 mm., the relative humidity 22, and the dew point —8'6° C.
 The great dryness of the air will be remarked.                   I then swung the
 thermometer in a conical path as close to the ice as possible, and the
 temperature of the air was 100° C. Being astonished to <U+FB01>nd so high
 a. temperature .so near the ice,         I put the bulb of the thermometer into
 a crack   in  the   ice, so as  to   be below   the level of the surface of the
 ice, and its temperature only Went down to 7'5)" C.
     All the temperatures were taken with a mercurial thermometer,
 which was whirled at the end of a string so that its velocity was
 about 6 111. per second.             It was not protected in any way, so that
 the temperatures observed with it are not free from a certain
 error due to radiation and re<U+FB02>ection, although it was always shaded
 from the direct sun.             These errors are not usually great with a
 whirled instrument, and most of my observations have to do with
 di<U+FB01>erences of temperatures observed with the same instrument and
  under similar circumstances. On the glacier the thermometer, when
  whirled, was not apparently a<U+FB01>ected by radiation or re<U+FB02>ection from
  the ice, and only very slightly by that from the sun. On land                     I

  112       Mr. J. Y. Buchanan.      On Rapid Variations   of   [May 31,
 remarked that the greatest disturbing e<U+FB01>ect is produced by sunlight
 re<U+FB02>ected from grass.      If the thermometer was whirled in the shade
 of a north wall with a grass <U+FB01>eld or hill-side close by, the thermo
 meter would be immediately affected to the extent of one to two
 degrees, according as the sun shone on the grass or was obscured by
 a cloud.    The e<U+FB02>ect was immediate the moment the sun came out;
 sunlight re<U+FB02>ected from rocks and light-coloured surfaces did not
 produce the same effect.
     On the 19th August I returned to the glacier. At 11 A.M. in the
 valley below the glacier I found the temperature of the air 22° C.,
 and the wet bulb 12°‘5, whence the vapour tension is 5'0 mm., and
 the'relative humidity 26. In determining the temperature of the
 air by whirling the thermometer I found variations of as much as 2°.
 The hot puffs of air made themselves felt most markedly, and
 showed that the real variations of the temperature of the air were
 much greater than the thermometer showed.             At 1 P.M., on the
 hill-side, to the west of the tongue of the glacier, and at a height
of about 2,100 m. above the sea, four good observations of the
temperature were made, giving 17°‘5, 18°‘0, 19°55, and 19°‘0; they
are all equally trustworthy,       and represent the average tempera
tures of the    air during   the  minute, or minute and a half, that the
thermometer was whirled.         The mean of these values, 18°'5 is taken
as the temperature of the air.       For determining the temperature of
the wet bulb the bulb of the thermometer was wrapped round with
one thickness of Swedish <U+FB01>ltering paper thoroughly moistened, and
the thermometer was whirled as before and until the temperature
ceased to fall, it then stood at 9°‘5.    Still higher up the hill at an
altitude of 2,250 m., the temperature of the air at 2 an. was
 18°‘5 0.     Having returned to the same spot where the observations
were    made  at 1 m1. the following air temperatures were observed :—
between 2.40 and 2.46 P.M., 17°"5, 18°‘0, 17°'5, 17°‘0, 17°‘3, 17°‘1;
mean, 17°'4; and between 2.50 and 2.54 P.M. 16°‘5, 16°‘5, 16°‘7, and
 16°‘5; mean, 160'55.     The mean of the two sets is 17°06. Again it
must be repeated that each of these individual observations is a.
faithful indication of the average temperature of the air in which
the thermometer was whirled, and in so far as its sensibility enabled
it to assume the same temperature as the air. From this spot I
descended to the glacier and went up it until I got to a position
 which, judging by the eye, was at the same height as the station just
left on the mountain side, and about one kilometre distant from it in
a straight line.    The weather was rapidly getting colder, the sky
being covered with the characteristic Fohn cloud. The wind was
fresh down the glacier, which made the exposure of the thermo
meter easy and good.       The hot Fohn puffs were also very striking.
The thermometer was <U+FB01>rst swung exposed to sun and wind, showing

1894.]     Atmospheric    Temperature, especially during Ftihn.        113
temperatures varying from 10°'5 to 11°‘2, the mean being 10°‘8 C.
Swung in my own shadow, but exposed to the wind, the temperature
was 9°‘8. The wet bulb was 4°'7, showing a relative humidity of 37.
The thermometer was now exposed, both wet and dry, in a horizontal
position with the bulb at a distance of about 2 cm. from the ice, on
the top of one of the super<U+FB01>cial ridges of the glacier, and fully
exposed to the wind, though shaded from the sun.             The observed
temperatures were: dry, 6°‘6 O. ; wet, 3°‘7 ; relative humidity, 58°‘5.
The exposure of the thermometer was as good as could be desired,
and, with the fresh breeze blowing, it was thoroughly ventilated.         I
was again much struck with the highness of the temperature of the
air almoet in actual contact with the ice. The observations at 1 m.
and 2 cm. from the ice were repeated, giving substantially the same
results—at 1 m., dry bulb 10°'2, wet 5°‘l; at 2 cm., dry bulb 6°‘8,
and wet 3°'2. The hot Fohn putts were more striking on the ice
than 0n the land, owing to the greater di<U+FB01>erence between their tem
perature and that of the surrounding air.           At 4 RM. I left the ice
and returned to the station of 1 o’clock on the hill-side, and took the
temperature at 4.35 P.M.—dry bulb 16°'O, wet 8°'0, relative humidity
24°“5.    At the station in the valley below the glacier the temperature
was at 5.45 P.M., dry bulb 16°“4, wet 11°“8, and relative humidity
56.     These observations, besides showing the remarkable conditions
of the air over the glacier, indicate the <U+FB01>neness and warmth of the
weather which prevailed.
    On the 21st August another series of observations was made
 at the stations on the land and on the ice.           The breeze on the
ice was not so steady    or so strong as  on the 19th, and  about 5 o’clock
 in the afternoon there was a heavy squall of rain and thunder.
 The same hot Fohn puifs made themselves felt as before, without
there being any means of measuring their temperature.                 Their
duration     at their  maximum      temperature    was   never  more   than
a. few seconds, during which      but little  e<U+FB01>ect  was  produced on the
thermometer.      It occurred to me that the only way of gaining a
knowledge of the temperature of these putts of air would be by com
paring the rapidity with which the thermometer moved when exposed
to a known di<U+FB01>erence of temperature, with that observed in the puffs.
 A number of observations was made with this view, by warming the
thermometer and noting its rate of cooling in air of known tempera~
ture. The reverse procedure was also followed on the ice. The
 thermometer was cooled by being laid close to, but not touching, the
 ice, it was then quickly raised to a height of 1 metre, and its rate of
 change of temperature observed. In this way it was found that for an
 initial di<U+FB01>erence of 4" the thermometer required 10 seconds to rise 1°,
 for a di<U+FB01>erence of 3° 12 seconds, and for a difference of 2°‘5 16 seconds.
 These ratios were observed in the open air, and under the circum
    VOL- LTI.                                                       I

      For comparison with the temperatures                      on the ice on the 19th, the
  mean of the observations on the land station at 2.45 and 4.35 P.M. is
  taken, and on the ice the mean of the observations at 3.20 and 3.55
,PJI.      The altitudes of the two stations were as nearly as possible
  identical, and they were not more than 1 kilometre distant from each

 1894.]    Atmospheric     Temperature, especially during Fohn.            115
 other. Considering the temperatures at a height of 1 In. there is
 a difference of 6°‘5 between the land and the ice.         The di<U+FB01>erence of
vapour tension, 0'2 mm., is insigni<U+FB01>cant, and shows that substantially
the air is the same. The dew point in both cases is several degrees
below 0°, so that, on coming in contact with the ice, there would be
evaporation from it. The evaporating power of the air may be repre
sented by the difference between the tension of saturation and the
actual vapour tension. It is very great on land, being 1075 mm. at
16°‘53 C., and it would rapidly evaporate water having that tempera
ture. On coming in contact, however, with ice the air actually in
contact, which alone comes under consideration, is <U+FB01>rst cooled to 0° 0.,
which reduces its saturation tension to 4'6 mm., and the diiference is
only 1'4 mm. We see, however, that this has been su<U+FB01>icient to increase
the absolute humidity of the air in close proximity to the ice. At
1 m. above the ice the air had an average temperature of 10° 0.; at
2 cm. from the ice its temperature was as high as 6°‘65 C., and the
air in actual contact with the ice must have been at 0° C. Many
observations have been made of the temperature of the air at di<U+FB01>erent
heights above glaciers, and, as might be expected, considerable dif
                                        I
ferences have been observed; but am not aware that any observations
have been made on the air almost but not quite in contact with the
ice, as are those which have been made at 2 cm. from the ice.             The
bulb was perfectly shaded from the sun but freely exposed to the
wind, it was also fully exposed to any cold radiations from the ice
 There is, therefore, no doubt that 6"‘65 was the temperature of the
 air passing the bulb. of the thermometer. The vertical distribution
 of temperature shown by these <U+FB01>gures is remarkable.                     From
 a height of 1 m. to within 2 cm. of the ice there is a gradient of
 3°‘41 per metre, in the remaining      2 cm. there is a gradient at the rate
of 33° per metre; and, from various observations and considerations,
it is probable that the moderate gradient is continued to within a
millimetre of the ice, when it becomes precipitous. It is to be noted
that the absolute humidity, as shown by the vapour tension of the air,
has increased from 3'4 mm., at 1 m., to 4'1 mm., at 2 cm. ; showing
that ice is being evaporated and transferred from the glacier to the
atmosphere.      The wind was blowing freshly down the glacier, and
its velocity was measured by noting the time which pieces of paper
allowed to drift took to reach the ice, and then pacing the distance.
The mean velocity was found to be from 8 to 10 kiloms. per hour.
    The observations made on the 2lst and on the 22nd con<U+FB01>rmed
those of the 19th.     The same variability of the air temperature at the
land stations was noticed.       Between 12.55 and 1.6 P.M. the following
temperatures     were  observed    by whirling :—16°'2, 16°'2, l6°'0, 15°‘5,
16°‘O, 15°‘5, 15°‘O, 14°'2, 13°'8, 141°'O,13°'5, 13°‘5. These are all good ob
servations, and represent real variations of the temperature, or rather
                                                                   I 2

116          Mr.  J. Y.      Buchanan.          On Rapid Variations      of   [May  31.
they indicate real variations of greater amount.                   Taking the mean of
the last <U+FB01>ve observations, we have the temperature of the air 14°'O.
The wet bulb was found at 1.15 RM. to be 7°‘5, giving a difference of
6°‘5.     On the glacier the air felt closer than on the previous occa
sion. The temperature at 1 m. was 11°‘5, and at 2 cm. from the ice
7°‘3.     The difference 4°‘2 is less than on the previous occasion. The
wind was much less strong, and yet the temperature close to the ice
is higher.        The wet bulb, under the same circumstances, showed
450. Five minutes later the dry bulb was observed at 1 m. 10°‘2 and
9°‘4:, mean 9°‘85.           Another observation of the dry bulb at 2 cm. from
the ice gave 6°‘6.              The interval between the bulb and the ice was
now reduced to the smallest possible distance, about 2 mm. The
wind fell very light, and the thermometer remained at 8°'(), when the
wind returned it fell to 5°‘8. The axis of the thermometer bulb
would be about 5 mm. from the ice, and still the air is nearly 6°
warmer than the ice. Another observation on the same conditions gave
5°‘5.     The wet bulb was now exposed, but it had to be kept about
5 mm. off the ice; it showed 3°‘2.                   At 2.43 P.M. a great volume of
warm air came down, and the wet bulb ran up to 4°“5 in three or
four seconds.          With the return of the breeze the wet bulb went back
to    3°‘O.     The    Fiihn pu<U+FB02>'s were now very troublesome.               At 2.52 PM.
the wet bulb at 1 m. was 7"‘0; the dry bulb showed—at 2.54 P.M.,
 11°‘0; at 2.55 P.M., 13°'5; and at 2.57 P.M., 14°'5. In one pu<U+FB01> the
thermometer was observed to rise one degree in eight seconds, which
 would make the true temperature of the air at the moment about 6°"0
higher, or 19°‘5.
    At 3.30 P.M. -I returned to the land stations, and again found the
 same variable temperatures. Between 3.35 and 3.415 P.M. the tem
 perature varied between 16°‘O and 13"‘5. The following averages
 were taken :—
            3.45 P.M., dry, 14°‘3       ; wet,   8°‘O ; relative humidity, 35°.
            4.0     ,,      ,,    141°‘0;    ,,  80'5;      ,,        ,,     42°-5_
    Taking the <U+FB01>rst of these and the observations at 1 o'clock, we have

 the air at cm. 2        is   7°‘3 warmer than the ice.
    On the 22nd August, the observations on the ice were repeated
 with very much the same results. The temperature of the air

   The result of the few observations here quoted is to show that the
air, which over land has a temperature of 15° to 20° or higher, in pass
ing over a glacier is cooled to a comparatively slight degree.
Although the air appears to be thoroughly mixed by its own motion,
very sharp gradients of temperature are produced and maintained.
The great and abnormal temperature of the air of the valley is kept
up by the heat liberated by the compression accompanying the
descent of local streams or striee of air from high levels.                          These keep
up   an  extra     supply    of   heat    over  and    above    what     is  supplied by the
direct radiation of the sun.                 The result is that the melting of the
glacier in Fohn weather greatly exceeds that of even the hottest
day of ordinary weather.

    Excepting in            the <U+FB01>rst interval the rate of fall of temperature
between        Pontresina         and the station on the mountain is less than 1°
per hundred metres.                   At the summit the mean temperature of the
 dry bulb was 10°‘75, and of the wet bulb 6°45, whence we have the
 vapour tension 4'5 mm. and the relative humidity 47. The weather
 was of the same kind as in the valley, abnormally warm, and the air
very dry.

    The thermometer which was used in these observations was not
  very sensitive, and when it was broken I could only replace it by one
  which was considerably less so. They were, therefore, of no use for
  determining rapidly varying temperatures. The method indicated

1894.]      Atmospheric Temperature, especially during Fohn.              119
above, whereby the temperature of the air is inferred from the velocity
with which the thermometervv rises or falls when immersed in it,
either at rest or moving with a known speed, is in itself quite satis
factory.     The dif<U+FB01>culty in applying it is to ascertain the rate of
motion of the air, because, other conditions being the same, the
thermometer changes its temperature in proportion to the velocity of
the air passing it. When the air has a horizontal motion it is called
wind, and there are many instruments for its measurement; but
there is probably nearly as much vertical as horizontal motion in
the atmosphere, but it is seldom observed and not easily measured.
In fact, a very good way of detecting these movements in air which,
to the senses, appears to be motionless, is to observe the rate of
cooling or heating of a thermometer in it. A thermometer similar to
the one used in these investigations was carefully tested as to its rate
of cooling, in connexion with a series of observations made in the
winter.
    Its rate of cooling was repeatedly determined in a room of constant
temperature, and in the open air, when it was, to all appearance,
motionless. Sometimes the rate of cooling in the open air was very
nearly the same as in the room, but at other.times it was much
greater.     It was never less. In four experiments, taking the same
excess of temperature above the air, namely, 5°“5 C., the temperature
of the thermometer fell by half that amount, 2°‘75 C., in the room in
 125 secs., and in the open air, which was apparently still, in 100, 70,
and in 55 secs. The volume of the bulb of this thermometer, which
 was cylindrical, was 0'92 0.0.; it was rather sluggish.

    Applying Leslie’s rule for <U+FB01>nding the “range of the thermometer
from the time it takes to cool to half the extent of the di<U+FB02>erence
 between its initial temperature and that of the air, we multiply it by
 101/70.    Leslie* de<U+FB01>nes the “range ” of a thermometer or other
body cooling to be the reciprocal of the fraction of the whole initial
 difference of temperature between the thermometer and the air, by
 which it cools in the <U+FB01>rst interval of time; or it is the time in which
 the thermometer would fall to the temperature of the medium,          inif,
 each successive interval of time, its temperature had fallen by the
 same amount as in the <U+FB01>rst interval of time.      The “ ranges ” of our
 thermometer cooling in the above conditions are found to be 180, 143,
 100, and 80 secs. respectively.

   If in our experiments we ascribe the whole difference in the rate of
cooling in the room and in the Open air to motion of the air, and
apply Leslie’s formula, we <U+FB01>nd that the air must have been passing
the thermometer at the rate of 0'5, 1'6, and 25 m. per second respec
tively.    On each occasion there was no perceptible horizontal motion
of the air, and the di<U+FB01>erences in the rates of cooling observed may, in
the absence of a better explanation, be held to indicate the presence
of ascending or descending currents of probably very local character.
   In the winter of this year I revisited the Engadin, and stayed for
a fortnight at St. Moritz.        As the room which      I occupied faced due
north the window of it was convenient for making observations of
the    temperature      of the air.      From the 24th February to the
 3rd March I made every morning a. series of observations of the
 temperature of the air, beginning when there was just light
enough to read the thermometer, and continuing till between 8 and
9 o’clock in the morning.            At <U+FB01>rst I took the temperature every
minute, but <U+FB01>nding the oscillations of temperature very great,               I
reduced the intervals to twenty seconds, and sometimes to <U+FB01>fteen
 seconds.    The thermometer used was the one whose “ ranges” in the
 still air of a room and outside have been given above. As before
 remarked, it is a sluggish instrument, yet the variations which it
indicated in these short intervals of time were much greater than
I  could have anticipated. To print the observations in emtenso would
occupy too much space, but the striking features can be easily sum
marised.      They are given in Table III.            Excepting on the 26th
February, when it was snowing all the morning, the observations
embrace the interval of an hour or an hour and a half after sunrise.
The time was devoted entirely to this object, and observations were
made at as close dates as possible.            Working alone, an interval of
twenty seconds is quite convenient; shorter intervals cause hurry. The
time immediately following sunrise is when one would expect the tem
perature of the air to rise continuously, if not regularly; but we see
that so far from rising continuously and regularly the thermometer

 rises, falls, and remains stationary quite irregularly.                 On some         days,
 as on the 28th February, these irregularities are comparatively                          few;
on others, as on the 1st and 2nd             of March, they        are numerous.           The
 largest rise or fall in twenty seconds is O°'5 C.                Froin experiments in
calm air outside and in still air in a. room                    we <U+FB01>nd that for this
thermometer to rise or fall 0°‘5 C. in twenty seconds the temperature
of the air around it must be from 2°'25 C. to 41°65 C. hotter or
colder than the thermometer. Taking even the lowest of these
values, we see how great the possible error is in measuring the
actual temperature of the air at any moment with a thermometer, and
the error is the greater the more sluggish the instrument is.                                In
Table IV the detailed observations are given for a few minutes on
the 26th February, when the temperature was changing very
rapidly.        In the third and fourth columns the rise or fall of the

   The <U+FB01>gures in this table are taken from the curves drawn by the
instrument on a drum revolving once in forty-eight minutes. The
instrument was allowed to take the temperature of the room, then
exposed in the shade in the open air when a fresh breeze was blowing
and allowed to remain there until    had taken the temperature of the it
air.  It was then transferred to the room, and allowed to rise until                                                                                    it
attained its temperature.

124       Mr.  J. Y. Buchanan.        0n Rapid Variations of     [May 31,
   In this way two sets of curves were obtained, consisting of three
curves in still air and three in a fresh breeze.        The results are not
very   concordant,  for, although the scale   of time is very open—1 min.
occupying 5 mm.—the temperature scale was very close, 1° occupy
ing only 1 mm.      The object, however, of the table is to show what
can be expected from an instrument of the kind in the measurement
of changes of temperature. The results obtained in the open air
would necessarily vary somewhat, because, although a fresh breeze
was blowing all the time, a fresh breeze varies in velocity.
   In order to obtain the best results from a. thermometer it should
be exposed to uniform ventilation.          This can only be e<U+FB01>ected by
arti<U+FB01>cial means, and they necessarily tend to efface sharp variations
of temperature. The arrangement adopted by Professor Assmann in
his psychrometer for ventilating and exposing his thermometers
ought to be suitable for this purpose. The current of air produced
must be uniform, and the behaviour of the thermometer as regards
rate of change of temperatures in the current produced must be
accurately determined.
   In Assmann’s arrangement the thermometer is enclosed in a metal
tube, consequently the diameter of the bulb, on which the sensitive
ness depends, can be made smaller and its length greater than would
be safe with an unprotected instrument.          A mercurial thermometer,
therefore, ventilated on Assmann’s system, ought to be ef<U+FB01>cient for
the measurement of temperatures changing with considerable
rapidity.
                                                    I
   Departing from the mercurial thermometer have found the simple
 air thermometer very good for indicating and measuring quick varia
tions of temperature. It has the advantage of lightness and cheap
ness.    The form which     I use is a glass bulb, of about 3 cm. diameter
on a straight stem of about 10 cm. length. This can be attached to
a U-tube of greater or less diameter, according as the diiferences of
 temperature to be observed are great or small. The U-tube has some
 coloured water as indicator, and the indications of the instrument
 are compared with those of a thermometer.              As the instrument
is only put together when it is wanted, the variations of barometric
 pressure do not a<U+FB01>ect it.     It has the great advantage that it can be
 connected with a tambour, and thus be made to record. The sensitive
ness of the glass air thermometer is about the same as that of a very
 <U+FB01>ne mercurial thermometer made for me by Messrs. Hicks. The air
 thermometer, however, would be very much more sensitive if the ball
 were made of thin metal instead of glass.
    There is a limit to the sensitiveness of all thermometers depending
                                     I
 on the dilatation of a <U+FB02>uid, and do not think that any such thermo
meter can be constructed which would give directly the true tem
 perature of the air in the pu<U+FB01>s of Ftihn wind which we have been

1894.]    Atmospheric    Temperature, especially during Fiihn.         125
discussing; by taking account of the rapidity of their movement
they can be constructed to give the temperature inferentially.         The
only probable method of observing directly such rapid changes of.
temperature is by electric or thermoelectric methods.          A thermo
electric junction is made of metals which conduct the heat rapidly,
and as their mass can be made very small and their speci<U+FB01>c heat is
low they can be made to follow the temperature of the medium in
which they are immersed more closely than any other form of ther
mometric apparatus. The galvanometer necessary for measuring the
currents produced is the inconvenient part of the apparatus, but am  I
informed by those familiar with such apparatus that a suitable instru
ment for use in the <U+FB01>eld could be constructed without difficulty.
    Thermometers as Calorimeters.—If we know not only the rate of
cooling of a thermometer, if we have the <U+FB01>gure which, in Leslie’s
language, is called the “range,” and if in addition we know the
thermal mass of the bulb which is generally expressed by its “water
value,” the thermometer becomes an ef<U+FB01>cient calorimeter. It is a
familiar observation that the thermometer and the senses frequently
 disagree about the warmth or coldness of the weather.             This is
because they measure different things.       The thermometer measures
the temperature of the air, the senses measure the heating or cooling
power of the atmosphere, or the rate at which the body is called upon
to receive or supply heat.    The body is a calorimeter and not a mere
thermometer. But with a knowledge of the constants above men
tioned, the thermometer becomes also a calorimeter.
    In connection with the melting of ice by the hot wind in the
 Engadin, and the corresponding abstraction of heat from the air,         I
 made a number of experiments by whirling thermometers at various
 speeds in air of de<U+FB01>nite temperature, having previously warmed the
 thermometer to a higher temperature.
    In order to give calorimetric expression to the result, and to express
 the heat exchange which had taken place, it was necessary to know
 the water value or thermal mass of the thermometer bulb. In similar
 experiments made by Leslie, he used a tin sphere 41 in. in diameter
 <U+FB01>lled with water, of which it contained more than half a litre, and
 there was no dif<U+FB01>culty in <U+FB01>nding the 1thermal mass, as that of the
 thermometer was an insigni<U+FB01>cant fraction of it. With a mercurial
 thermometer, however, of ordinary type the glass envelope of the
 bulb is as important from a calorimetric point of view as the mercury
 contained in it; and it is impossible to know the proportions in
 which the two substances are present, except by weighing them in
 process either of construction or of destruction.   The former of these
 processes was excluded, and     I hesitated to adopt the latter before
 some more use had been got out of the thermometer.           Meantime    I
 endeavoured to estimate the probable thermal mass of the bulb by

126        Mr. J. Y. Buchanan.        On Rapid Variations of      [May 31,
carefully   measuring it, and assuming a probable         thickness of the
glass.    In dealing with problems of this sort it is necessary to
express the speci<U+FB01>c heat    in terms of the volume, and for this purpose
the ordinary   numbers    which   express the capacity for heat of unit
weight have to be multiplied by the density, which expresses the
weight of 1 c.c. of the substance.       The density of mercury is 13596,
and that of ordinary glass is 2'45; their speci<U+FB01>c beats per unit weight
are 0033 and 0‘19 respectively;          whence the capacity for heat of
l  c.c. of mercury is 0'449,  and  of  glass 0466.   If their speci<U+FB01>c heats
are taken as identical and equal to 0'457, the error made will not be
more than 2 per cent., in the extreme case where the bulb is all glass
or all mercury.
   Hence it appeared that there was no necessity for knowing the
thickness of the glass of the bulb or the weight of mercury in it.
For calorimetric purposes, a knowledge of the volume of the bulb
suf<U+FB01>ces, and it is immaterial in what proportion the two substances
are present. The <U+FB01>gures on which this calculation are based are for
ordinary soda or potash glass, which was no doubt used in the con
struction of the German thermometers which         I was using.
   Using the value 0457 for the speci<U+FB01>c heat per unit volume of the
bulb, and whirling the thermometer at the uniform rate of 6 m. per
 second, twelve observations were made of the thickness of the <U+FB01>lm of
air heated to the full amount, corresponding to the fall of tempera
ture of the thermometer. The difference between the initial tem
perature of the thermometer and that of the air varied from 18° C. to
2° C., and the resulting computed thicknesses of the <U+FB01>lm of air heated
varied from 0'209 to 0267 mm. ; the mean value was 0'237 mm.
   The measurement of the volume of the bulb requires some atten
tion. The most convenient form of the bulb is the cylindrical, and
it is also the most common. But the bulbs are very rarely truly
cylindrical, they are often considerably tapered.       It is not suf<U+FB01>cient
to measure the diameter of the bulb with callipers, it is necessary to
measure the circumference at various parts of the bulb. One simple way
is to envelop the bulb with a wrapper of tissue paper, like a cigarette,
to blacken the edge of the paper which is laid inside.                When
the paper is neatly and smoothly laid on, pressure with the <U+FB01>nger
along the line of the inner edge of the paper produces a sharp impres
sion of the edge on the overlapping paper.         On unrolling the paper
the exact envelope   of the  bulb lies  between the blackened edge of the
paper and the impression which it has made on the paper underlying
it. The length of the bulb is very easily measured, and when the
paper envelope has been, to begin with, given the proper length, it
measures the outer surface of the bulb, less the surface of the end.
This is asumed to be hemispherical, and is added accordingly.          The
upper end of the bulb, where the stem joins on, is neglected, as in

       1894.]      Atmospheric Temperature, especially during Fohn.                          127
      thermometers of German pattern, it takes little part in the exchange
      of heat with       the outside.         Another method of obtaining the exact
      circumference of the bulb, which is a little easier and perhaps more
      exact, is to wind <U+FB01>ne thread round it, each turn touching its neigh
      bour closely until, say, ten turns have been taken.                        The thread is
      then unwound and measured.                  The tenth part of the length is the
      circumference of the bulb. By measuring the axial space occupied
                                                                   ”
      by the ten turns, the correction for “ pitch can be ascertained, but
     if anything but very coarse thread is used it is negligible. The
     active super<U+FB01>cial area of the bulb is given by adding to the hemi
     spherical end surface the product of the mean circumference into
     the total length of the cylindrical part of the bulb. In like manner,
     the volume of the bulb is obtained by adding to the hemispherical
     volume of the end the product of the mean circular area into the
     length of the cylindrical part of the bulb. The volume, multiplied by
     0'457, gives the thermally equivalent volume or weight of water.
         Air thermometers of the simple kind described above, are very
     easily made so as to give calorimetrical results. It is only necessary
     to weigh and measure the piece of glass tube before blowing the
     bulb. The shortening of the straight part of the tube after blowing
     gives the length of it which has been expanded into a ball, and from
    the known length and weight of the original piece of tube, the weight
    of the bulb is found. By carefully gauging the volume of the ball its
    volume can be obtained, and from that the thickness of the glass.
    When the speci<U+FB01>c heat of the glass is known, the water value of the
    bulb is given ; if the air contained is taken into account, the value is
    increased by from 1 to 2 per cent. The surface of the ball divided by

VII. “The        Root of Lyginodendron Old/tamium, Will.” By W.

         Ph.D., F.L.S., F.G.S. Received March 14, 1894.
    During     a  re-investigation       of the structure of Lyginodendronf
the results of which we hope to lay before the Royal Society on a
future occasion, an important fact has come to light, which we desire
to place on record without delay.
    A carbouiferous fossil, with the structure perfectly preserved, has
been described in previous memoirs, under the name of Kalomylon
Hookem', Wilhf        We have now established the fact that Kaloxylon
was not an independent plant, but was the root of Lyginodend/ron
 Oldham'ium.
    Specimens, presenting in every respect the typical Kalowylon struc
ture, have been found in actual continuity with the stem of Dygino
dendron, arising from it as lateral appendages.                Their structure and
mode of origin prove that they were adventitious roots.                          These
organs branched freely, and we have roots and rootlets of all sizes,
and at all stages of development.
    This discovery enables us to give a complete account of the vege
tative organs of Lyginoclendmn, as we are now fully acquainted with
the structure, not only of the stem and foliage, but also of the adven
titious roots.

                                        (Abstract)
      The Newtonian constant of gravitation G, i.e., the force in. dynes
  between 2 grams of matter 1 cm. apart, has been determined with a
  very accurately constructed piece of apparatus, designed on the lines
   which   I  laid down in my paper on the Cavendish experiment (‘ Roy.
  Soc. Proc.’, vol. 46, p. 293). The important dimensions are approxi
  mately—

     Di<U+FB01>erence of level between right and left sides                .  6 in.
     The lead balls were hung by phosphor bronze wires from pillars in
  the  lid of the apparatus, and the gold balls by quartz <U+FB01>bres from the
  ends of the “beam mirror.”              The beam mirror was supported by a
  quartz    <U+FB01>bre,   17 in.    from   a  torsion   head.       An elaborate system of
  screens protected    the    apparatus    from   temperature variations.
           “                      ”
     An      optical compass          of extreme precision was employed in
  measuring the horizontal distances between the <U+FB01>bres and between
  the wires, which alone among the geometrical magnitudes need be
  known with a very high degree of precision.
     The scale was 9 ft. long, divided into 50ths of an inch. It was
, placed at a distance equal to 14,000 divisions.               It could be read with
  certainty to 1/10 division.          The de<U+FB02>ections varied according to the
  circumstances of each experiment from 351 to 577 divisions, and the
  squares of the periods from 35,431 to 58,519 secs.2

 II.   “On the Recurrent Images following Visual Impressions.”
        By SHELFORD BIDWELL, M.A., LL.B., F.R.S. Received                           .
        March   27, 1894.
    The earliest recorded observation which              I have been able to <U+FB01>nd
 ofa certain curious phenomenon            associated    with optical after-images
 is that of Professor C. A. Young, who published a note on the subject
in the year 1872, and proposed that the phenomena should be called
“recurrent vision.”*       He noticed that when a powerful Leyden jar
discharge took place in a darkened room, any conspicuous object was
seen twice at least, with an interval of a little less than a quarter of a
second; often it was seen a third time and sometimes even a fourth.
 He thought that the phenomenon suggested the idea of a re<U+FB02>ection
of the nervous impulse at the nerve extremities, as if the intense
impression upon the retina, after being the <U+FB01>rst time propagated to
the brain, was re<U+FB02>ected back to the retina and thence again to the
 brain, thus renewing the sensation of vision.
    Afew months later an account of two experiments on the same
subject was published by Mr. A. S. Davis?                  In the <U+FB01>rst, a piece of
charcoal, one end of which was red-hot, was waved about so asto
describe an ellipse or circle a few inches in diameter. A blue image
of the burning end was seen following the charcoal ata short distance
behind it, the space between the charcoal and its image being ab
solutely dark.      The interval of time after which the sensation of
blue light succeeded the primary sensation was estimated to be about
a. <U+FB01>fth of a second.    The other experiment was made with a piece of
apparatus resembling a photographic instantaneous shutter.                     The
shutter was interposed between the observer’s eye and the sky and
was covered with pieces of coloured glass, through which momentary
<U+FB02>ashes of light were allowed to pass.            It was found that each <U+FB02>ash
was, after a short interval, generally succeeded by a recurrent image,
the colour of which was quite different from that of the glass.                The
results of Mr. Davis’s observations are summarised below.
   Mr. Davis remarks that except as regards the red glass, the re
current colour does not differ much from the complementary colour,

and he concludes that when any one of the three kinds of Young
Helmholtz nerve <U+FB01>bres is excited, an excitation is induced in the
nerve <U+FB01>bres of the other kinds, the process being analogous to the in
duction of electric currents.
                   I
    In 1885 called attention to a very simple and effective method of
exhibiting a recurrent image.* If an ordinary vacuum tube, illu
minated by an induction coil discharge, is made to rotate slowly
upon a horizontal axis <U+FB01>xed at right angles to the middle of the tube,
the tube is seen to be followed at a distance of a few degrees by a
ghost-like image of itself, the ghost exactly imitating the original in
form, but having a uniform steel-grey colour. In the same paper the
following observation is noted :—“ The vacuum tube being at rest in
a feebly lighted room,                      I  concentrated my gaze upon a certain small
portion of it while the discharge was passing. The current was then
interrupted and the luminous image was almost instantly replaced by
a corresponding image which appeared to be intensely black upon a.
less dark back-ground.                                                         I
                                                After a period which estimated at from a
quarter to half a second the black image again became luminous;
this luminous impression lasted but for a small fraction of a second
and the series of phenomena terminated with its disappearance
.     .    .  .     .     It was also found desirable to make the preliminary
illumination as short as possible, a single <U+FB02>ash being generally
suf<U+FB01>cient to produce the phenomena.” The following comment was
added :—“ The series of phenomena seem to be due to an affection of
the optic nerve which is of an oscillatory character. Abnormal dark
ness follows as areaction after the luminosity, and again after ab
normal darkness there is a rebound into feebler luminosity.”
    The subject has recently attracted much attention in connection
with the experiments of                                Aug. Charpentier.             The account of
                             M.                       in                    “ Retinal

 observer's eye is <U+FB01>xed upon its centre, there appears upon the white
 sector, near to its leading edge, a well-de<U+FB01>ned dark band, which is
 separated from the black ground of the disk by a similar white band.
  The angular extension of the dark band increases with the speed of
 rotation, so that it always takes the same time to pass over a <U+FB01>xed
 point on the retina; it begins about one-sixty-<U+FB01>fth or one-seventieth
 of a second after the <U+FB01>rst passage of the white, and lasts sensibly the
 same time.       He goes on :—“ The dark band is in fact only a kind of
 reaction of the retina after the luminous excitation, a reaction'which
 can be demonstrated in a totally different manner.                     I have found
 that if an instantaneous luminous excitation is produced in complete
 darkness the sensation appears to be reduplicated; shortly after its
 <U+FB01>rst generation it seems to disappear and then manifest itself again.
 This is the case, for example, when a single discharge from a
 Ruhmkorlf coil is passed through a Crookes or Geissler vacuum tube,
 or simply, but less obviously, through the air           .....        There is, then,
 in this last experiment, as in the <U+FB01>rst, a negative reaction of the retina
 under the in<U+FB02>uence of excitation         .....        It would be dif<U+FB01>cult, and in
 any case premature, to indicate the cause of this phenomenon, but it
 may fairly be characterised as the result of a retinal oscillation set up
 under the in<U+FB02>uence of the beginning of the luminous excitation.”                    I
 think it clearly appears from the above extract that M. Charpentier
 was unacquainted with the earlier observations of myself and others.
    In consequence of the importance which seemed to be attached by
 physiologists to the phenomena of visual reaction, as evidenced by
 Professor Burdon Sanderson’s recent Presidential Address to the
 British Association)“       I was induced to undertake the further experi
 mental investigation, of which an account is given in the present
 paper. This deals partly with the colours of recurrent images under
different conditions, and partly with the reaction attending the early
stages of a luminous impression as noticed by Charpentier.
    In the observation of the recurrent images set up by the action of
                                 I
light of different colours began, like Mr. Davis, by using coloured
glasses.
   A metal disk, about        8 cm. in diameter, was arranged so as to rotate
slowly   and   steadily    about   its centre in front of the condenser of a
projection lantern.         Near the edge of the disk was a circular aperture
about 0'5 cm. in diameter, the image of which was focnssed upon a
distant screen.      A plate of coloured glass was placed before the pro
jecting   lens,  and    thus was obtained a small, coloured disk of light,
which described a circular path upon the screen.                  The coloured disk
was, in most cases, seen to be followed at an interval of a few degrees
by a ghost of the same size and shape, but of feebler luminosity, and
of a hue which varied more or less with the colour of the glass

for the experiment than an arc lamp, the intensity of the light being
easily varied. S is an adjustable slit, M a projection lens, P a bi
sulphide of carbon prism, D a metal plate, in the middle of which is
a. circular aperture 2 mm. in diameter.            A spectrum, 6 or 7 cm. in
length,   can be projected upon    D,  a small    selected portion of it passing
through    the  aperture and  falling upon       the  mirror  Q, which is 8 cm.
in diameter. To the back of the mirror is attached a horizontal arm,
which is not quite perpendicular to the mirror, its inclination being
capable of adjustment.     The arm is rotated by clock-work, and turns
once in 1% secs.
   It was at <U+FB01>rst attempted to study the phenomenon by direct eye

                              believe that, after suf<U+FB01>cient practice, this
would be found the best possible method of observation; but it is
exceedingly dif<U+FB01>cult to keep the eye absolutely steady, and untrained
observers never succeeded in seeing the looked-for phenomena at
all.‘ Since it seemed desirable that my own observations should be
con<U+FB01>rmed by others,                                      I
                          abandoned the telescope and the ground glass,
and by means of the lens N focussed the re<U+FB02>ected image of the
aperture upon a white screen, R. The diameter of the projected
disk of coloured light was about 1'5 cm., and that of the approxi
mately circular path which it described, 30 cm. To aid in steadying
the eye, a spot of luminous paint, upon which the gaze might be
directed, was applied at the centre of the circle.     With this arrange
ment, almost any one can see the ghosts without the smallest
di<U+FB02>iculty.
   When the mirror turns once in            secs., the ghost or recurrent          111;
image appears about 50° behind the coloured disk, the corresponding
time interval being one-<U+FB01>fth of a second.          Exact measurement is,
however, not easy, and          probable that the interval   it not quite

the same   with light derived  from  different portions  of the spectrum.
The ghost appears to be circular in form, its diameter being generally
rather less than that of the original.     The colours of the recurrent
images, as speci<U+FB01>ed below, have all been observed by several persons,
and, except as to those at the extreme limits of visibility, all the
observations were in agreement.

    For the    screen with the aperture at D, <U+FB01>g. 1, another was substi-i
tuted, having a horizontal slit 7 cm. long and 2 mm. wide, the image
of which was projected upon the screen R after re<U+FB02>ection from the
rotating mirror.        Thus a small spectrum was produced, which re
volved parallel to itself, in a circle about 1 metre in diameter.’*          The
eyes   were   directed   upon <U+FB01>xed spot near one end of the horizontal
                               a
diameter of the circle. The spectrum was followed by a ghost of the
form rather roughly indicated in fig. 2. It extended from the orange
of the spectrum to the beginning of the violet, terminating somewhat
abruptly at the orange end, and fading away gradually at the other.
The image was distorted, as shown in the <U+FB01>gure, approaching nearest
to the spectrum at about the middle of the green, a little on the more
refrangible side of the most luminous portion.             The distance sepa
rating the spectrum from the image increased more rapidly towards
the red end of the spectrum than towards the violet end, and the
image was widened out considerably at the violet end; but neither
the moving spectrum itself nor its recurrent image was so sharply
de<U+FB01>ned as appears in the diagram.
   It was remarkable that the whole of the recurrent image of the
spectrum was of a violet hue, being brightest where the distance
Irom the spectrum was least. No trace whatever of yellow or
greenish-yellow could be detected at the more refrangible end, nor
of blue or bluish-green at the other.
   The apparent absence of any colour except violet in the recurrent
image of the complete spectrum is capable of two possible explana
tions. The greenish-yellow seen at one end, and the blue and bluish
green seen at the other, when the spectrum colours are tested sepa
rately, may be due merely to an e<U+FB02>'ect of contrast, the true colour of
the image being in both cases a weak violet.                 Or, on the other
hand, these colours may really be present at the ends of the image
of the whole spectrum, being, however, of too weak an intensity
to be distinguishable when in proximity to the more luminous por
tions of the spectrum itself and of its image.
    Two experiments were made in the hope of settling this question.
                                  Experiment   3.
    The slit at D was removed, and in its place was put a zinc plate
having two small apertures close together. A second lantern and
prism were set up, and two spectra were projected upon the zinc
plate.    By the help of screens, things were so arranged that a violet
   * Helmholtz observed the after-images of a spectrum seen for an instant, but
failed to notice the dark interval which preceded their appearance (‘ Phys. Opt.,’
p. 376).

ray from one spectrum passed through one of the apertures, while a
violet ray from the other spectrum passed through the other.
These were re<U+FB02>ected from the mirror (which was not rotated), and
formed two violet disks side by side upon the screen.   By adjusting

these disks was made as bright as possible, and the other very
feeble. By the side of the bright violet disk the feeble one often
seemed to be of a greenish-yellow hue, though, when seen alone, it
was distinctly violet.
                                  Experiment   4:.
   In a similar manner a feeble violet and brighter greenish-yellow
were placed side by side, but, however much the intensity of the
former was diminished,       could never be made_to assume a blue

   While, therefore, the result of Experiment        consistent with the
                                                     3   is

                                                4
it; but there so great a difference in the circumstances of the two
               is
kinds of observation, the one involving a. deliberate comparison of the
colours of two stationary luminous disks, and the other an estimate
formed while a disk and its recurrent image were in rapid motion,
that the opposing evidence cannot be regarded as conclusive.
Another experiment was therefore devised.
                               Experiment      5.
  The original screen with one small aperture was placed at D, and
two spectra were projected upon it in such    manner that a green
                                                     a
ray from one spectrum, and a red ray from the other, passed through
the aperture, forming red and green images which were exactly
superposed upon the screen R. The colour of the single image thus
formed could, by suitable regulation of the limelights, be made
greenish-yellow, yellow, or orange-yellow, these colours being, of
course, not simple ones, but compounds of red and green.           Now, red
by  itself  gives no  recurrent image' whatever (this was    veri<U+FB01>ed before
proceeding further by shutting off the green ray), while green by
itself gives a violet recurrent image.        The question to be decided
was whether the green, when accompanied by the inert red, would
give a violet recurrent image as     if   were alone, or whether the com
                                          it
pound      colour  formed    by  the   combination    greenish-yellow, for
example—would be attended by a blue or bluish-green recurrent
image, just as if the compound were a simple spectrum colour.
   The latter was found to be the case. The same hue of greenish
yellow, whether a simple spectrum colour or a compound of red and
green, was always attended by a blue ghost. When the red ray of
the compound was shut off by        a screen, the ghost instantly became
violet: when the screen was removed            itat once resumed its blue
colour.

140                  Mr. S. Bidwell.       On the Recurrent            [June     7,
    This experiment, though not conclusive, is clearly in favour of the
probability that the blue and bluish-green recurrent colours apparently
observed when the yellow and orange portions of the spectrum are
tested separately are due merely to an e<U+FB01>ect of mental judgment, and
not to any cause of a physiological nature.
    There are, therefore, four independent facts which are consistent
with the conclusion that luminous recurrent images are due to a
reaction of the violet nerve <U+FB01>bres only.
    (a.)  With white light the recurrent colour is violet.
    (1).) In the recurrent image of the complete spectrum no colour
            but violet can be detected.
     (0.) A pure red light, however intense, gives no recurrent image.
            It is generally supposed by the supporters of the Young
            Helmholtz theory that red light has no action upon the
            violet nerve-<U+FB01>bres.
    (d.)  The   apparently blue colour of the ghost of simple spectrum
            yellow is just as well produced by a compound yellow con
            sisting of green and red, the latter of which is inert when
            tested separately.
    The path of the revolving spot of light is generally marked by a
phosphorescent track, which, when the rate of revolution is not less
than one turn in 1% secs, often forms a complete circle.                The bril
liancy of this luminous trail seems to vary with di<U+FB01>erent observers,
in some cases apparently being so intense that the recurrent image
cannot be distinguished from it at all. The trail is due to the usually
feeble continuation of the after-image, of which the bright initial
stage constitutes the recurrent image.
    A spot of red light, although it is never followed by a ghost, is
always considerably elongated during its revolution, and its colour
ceases to be uniform, the rear portion assuming a light bluish-pink
tinge. However small the spot of light is made, and however high
the speed of revolution, no complete separation of the spot into red
and pink portions has ever been effected.
    In the experiment next to be described the Charpentier effect and
the recurrent image are made to exhibit themselves simultaneously,
                                   Experiment      6.
    Two blackened zinc disks, 15 cm. in diameter, from each of which
two opposite quadrants were cut out,* were mounted in contact with
each other on a horizontal axis, driven by clockwork and making one

                                    out

from   0° to 90°.   The apparatus was set up opposite a box containing
a 32-candle power incandescent lamp, with a variable resistance in

covered with a sheet of ground glass.
   The sectors being in the <U+FB01>rst place opened as widely as possible,
I  <U+FB01>xed my eye upon the centre of the double disk, and at once saw
 Charpentier’s dark band upon the illuminated background.
    The sectors were then gradually closed up, until the posterior edge
of the dark band approximately coincided with that of the sector.*
 When this was accomplished it was found that the arc of the open
sector was equal to about       <U+FB02> part of the whole circumference. The
dark reaction, therefore, ceased in (31-2 of 1% secs. =)      <U+FB02>

<U+FB01>rst impact   of  the light upon the  eye.
   For more readily demonstrating the succeeding phenomena, it was i
found convenient to again open the sectors a little, so that they
covered an angle of about 10° or 12°.       Resuming the observation, it
was seen that the posterior edge of the open sector was bordered by
a luminous fringe due to persistence.       A little beyond the termina
tion of the fringe there appeared an intensely black radial band,
estimated to cover a space of from 3° to 4°, and easily visible even
upon the black ground of the metal disk, though it is shown far
more conspicuously upon a translucent disk made of stout writing
paper, with a sector cut out. Lastly, after another interval of',
perhaps, 35° or 40°, came the luminous recurrent image<U+FB01> which,
with the yellowish light of the incandescent lamp, appeared to be of
a blue colour. By varying the angular aperture of the sector, it
was ascertained that the recurrent image appeared at a <U+FB01>xed interval
after the light was cut 01?, and not after its <U+FB01>rst impact.
   This method of observation revealed one other point of interest,
which seems hitherto to have escaped notice, though it is evident
enough with a Charpentier disk, when once attention has been
directed to it. The average illumination of the bright band inter
vening between the dark band and the leading edge of the sector is
much more intense than that of the other portion of the sector.
Moreover, it is not uniform, but increases, gradually at <U+FB01>rst, and
very rapidly at last, from the leading edge up to the dark band.
In fact when the light used is not strong, the luminous margin of the
bright band is a far more conspicuous object than the dark band
itself: it appears to glow almost like a white-hot wire.
   Charpentier states that, under favourable conditions, he has been
  i" This was not a very easy operation, because the luminous sector was slightly
widened by persistence, especially near the circumference.
     This, of course, cannot be seen upon a translucent paper disk being over
    'f-
powered by the transmitted light.

  band of greatly diminished intensity, though he adds that the obser
  vation is a very dif<U+FB01>cult one.‘         What is probably the same effect in a
  different form can, however, be shown quite easily in the following
  manner.
                                    Empemiment    7.
     In  a blackened zinc disk         15 cm.  in diameter, there were out two
 opposite radial slits, about 0'5 mm. in width. The disk was rotated
 at the rate of one turn per second in front of a sheet of ground glass,
 behind which was an incandescent lamp. The glass was covered
  with opaque paper, in which a circular opening was made of slightly
 less diameter than the disk.             The disk was placed opposite this
 opening, and no light reached the eye except such as passed through
 the two slits.     When the disk was observed from a distance of about
 1% metres,    the  eye being <U+FB01>xed upon its centre, each slit appeared to
 give four (or possibly <U+FB01>ve) luminous images, arranged like the ribs
 of a partly opened fan. The images were distinctly separated by
 dark intervals near the circumference, but overlapped one another
 towards the centre.        The leading image was naturally the brightest,
 each   consecutive    image being considerably weaker than its precursor.
 All had the same tone of colour, namely that of the yellowish-light
 given by the electric lamp. The usual blue recurrent image could
 also be seen following the images of the radial slits, at an angle of
 about 80°.
    It appears, then, that when the retina is exposed to the action of
 light for a limited time, the complete order of visual phenomena is
 as follows :—
     (1) Immediately upon the impact of the light there is experienced
          a sensation of luminosity, the intensity of which increases for
          about one-sixtieth of a second : more rapidly towards the end
          of that period than at <U+FB01>rst.
    (2)   Then   ensues a sudden reaction, lasting also for about one-sixtietli
          of a second, in virtue of which the retina becomes partially
          insensible to renewed or continued luminous impressions.
           These _two effects may be repeated in a diminished degree, as
          often as three or four times.
    (3) The stage of <U+FB02>uctuation is succeeded by a sensation of steady
          luminosity, the intensity of which is, however, considerably
          below the mean of that experienced during the <U+FB01>rst one-sixtieth
          of a second.
   *  I have noticed that the intensity of the dark band always appears to <U+FB02>uctuate
very rapidly, perhaps twenty or thirty times in a second. The rate of <U+FB02>uctuation
is quite regular, and independent of the rate of rotation.

          ceeded by a brief interval of darkness.

          followed by another interval of ordinary darkness.

representation of the above-described chain of sensations.                                   No
account has been taken of the comparatively feeble after-image, to
which the phosphorescent trail before referred to is due, and which
may last for two seconds or more.                                                            .

that any one, who is quite unaccustomed to observations of the kind,
will be entirely successful in a <U+FB01>rst attempt at repeating the ex

    Since the above was written, there has been brought to my notice
an important paper by Dr. Carl Hess, “ On the After-images follow
ing luminous Impressions of short Duration.“ In his principal
experiments momentary illumination was produced by means of an
instantaneous shutter, giving an exposure of 1/100 or 1/20(.) second.

 144        Recurrent Images following        V 'sual Impressions.     [June    7,
Observations were made of the effects following excitation by white
light, by coloured light derived from different portions of the spec
trum, and by the whole spectrum at once. In all his experiments.
Dr. Hess noticed the occurrence of what he speaks of as a negative
after-image of very short duration (corresponding to what                I   have
called an interval of darkness) which followed almost immediately
upon the termination of the illumination, and preceded what is
“ commonly known as the positive after-image.” He states that this
negative after-image which, according to his measurements,                 lasted
for about one-third or one-half second, was overlooked by Helmholtz,
Aubert, Fich and others.          Hering, however, had reasons for suspect
ing   its existence,  and    it was  to test this point that the eXperiments
in which Hering himself co-operated, were undertaken.
   The negative after-images are stated not to have been represented
in all cases by mere darkness. Under favourable conditions, the
                       ”
“dark after-image         succeeding a momentary excitation by coloured
light,   was  tinted  with   a colour complementary to the original one;
and when the stimulus was generated by the complete spectrum, all
the complementary colours were seen for a short time after its disap
pearance.      No such complementary tints have ever revealed them
selves in my own experiments, the space between                    the primary
luminous     image   and  its  ghost always appearing     as  simply dark.
   The colours assigned by Dr. Hess to the           “                           ”
                                                        positive after-images
also differ from those observed by myself. In most cases he describes
the positive after-image as either having a feeble colour of the same
hue as that of the light employed for the stimulus, or as being
colourless.
                                I
    Dr. Hess considers, as do, that the brightest portion of the posi
tive after-image of the spectrum corresponds with the green, and
remarks that the brightness decreases gradually towards the more
 refrangible end of the spectrum, and much more quickly towards
the less refrangible end.
    Such discrepancies as seem to exist between Dr. Hess’s results and
my own may perhaps be accounted for by the very different methods
of observation which we employed. A stationary stimulus would, no
doubt, be better adapted than a moving one for developing the feeble
tints of the dark negative after-images, as well as those exhibited by
the bright positive after-images during by far the greater part of
their continuance, which, according to Dr. Hess’s estimate, is as long
as from four to eight seconds.             On the other hand, the method
 adopted by myself       discloses  the   important   fact, of which Dr. Hess
 makes no mention whatever, that the positive images are immensely
brighter for a very brief initial period—not more than one-tenth of a
 second—than during their subsequent existence.                While this phase
 of transient brilliancy altogether failed to attract Dr. Hess’s notice,

    1.   Conjectures as to the Age of Niagaxra. Fella—Prior to the writing
of    the present paper, most of the conjectures as to the age of the
 Falls have been based simply upon the supposed uniform rate of
recession. Thus, in 1790, Andrew Ellicott assigned 55,000 years as
 the age of the Falls.      In 1841, Sir Charles Lyell allowed 35,000 years;
 in 1886, Professor R. S. Woodward, after three surveys had been
 made, calculated the age as 12,000 years; and later, Mr. G. K. Gilbert,
 supposing the recession to progress at the maximum axial retreat
 alone, reduced the age of the Falls 6,000 years.         This latter was not
 intended as an estimate, as he fully recognised that such a time must
 have been greatly lengthened by many changing conditions. The rate
                                                                              ‘
 adopted by the <U+FB01>rst two writers was only conjectural, as no surveys
 had then been made. Three surveys had been completed before the
 writings of the latter two writers, and I have had the bene<U+FB01>t of a
 fourth. Woodward’s calculation was upon the mean mathematical
 enlargement of the Horseshoe gulf at the end of the chasm, which
  rate was less than the geological rate of retreat.            The author’s
  method differs from the others in that it takes into consideration the
 rate of recession throughout the changing episodes of the river,
  which have been entirely discovered by Gilbert or himself. His com~
  putations make the age surprisingly near to the conjecture of Lyell.

  details as bear upon the subject, some of which do not appear else
  where.
     3. Geology of the District—Besides         what may be found in other
  works, there are several measured sections and descriptions showing
 the amount of work the river had to do. Several <U+FB01>gures illustrate
 the varying conditions.

   146              Dr.  J. W. Spencer.     Niagara Falls           [June 7,
     4. Ancient Topography.-—-The Niagara is amodern river.        It crosses
  a broad ancient valley nearly 100 ft. deep, in the vicinity of the Falls.
  This depression has largely escaped the attention of even geologists,
  and entirely in its bearing upon the history of the Falls.       The pecu
  liar extension of the chasm    at the Whirlpool, and the buried valley of
   St. David’s, have been considered by many as part of a preglacial
  Niagara river. This is now found to be a branch of a buried valley
  outside the Niagara when, and hundreds of feet shallower, with
   ancient sloping V-shaped walls, whilst those of the gorge are vertical.
   It is only an incident that the modern river touched this drift-<U+FB01>lled
  valley, but it has given rise to the elongation of the chasm at the
   Whirlpool.   The drainage of the tableland in ancient times was across
  the direction of the Niagara river, and was strongly marked by bold
  limestone ridges, which have only been penetrated by the Falls in
  modern times.      Even the Erie basin emptied by a route several miles
  west of the Niagara.
      5. Basement of the River.-—In order to explain the work done by
  the river, this feature is described, part of the banks of the original
  course, before sinking into the chasm, being on hard rocks, and part
  on local deposits of drift. Even the deserted river banks carved out
  of such accumulations are still well preserved.
     6. Discharge of the Niagara Riven—This is only important in order
  to learn what is the discharge of the Erie basin alone; for during a
  considerable portion of the life of the Niagara only the Erie waters
  fell over the falls. The drainage of the Erie basin is 3/11 of that
‘
  of the four great upper lakes.
     7. Modern Recession of the FaZZs.—From four surveys, extending
  over a period of forty-eight years, the mean modern rate of recession
  of the Falls is found to be 4'175 ft. a year. Its rate is variable with
  secular episodes of rapid medial recession, followed by its cessation along
  the axis, but with increased lateral retreat. This cycle appears to
  take about <U+FB01>fty years. But the detailed <U+FB01>gures are given with a map.
  This rate is, however, excessive, on account of the geological con
  ditions favouring the rapid modern recession, but the rate taken for
  the mean recession under the conditions of the modern descent of
  the river with the present discharge is 3‘75 ft. a year.
     8. Sketch of the Lake History and the Nativity of Niagara River.—
  At one time a great proportion of the lake region was covered by a
  single sheet, or the Warren Water. Upon its dismemberment —in part,
  at least, by the rise of the land—one large lake was formed occupying
  the basins of Huron, Michigan, and Superior; and another a portion
  of the Erie extending into the Ontario basin.       The waters in these
  two basins were subsequently lowered, so that they fell to their rocky
  eastern rims, and the three upper lakes discharged by way of Lake
  Nipissing and the Ottawa river, and the Niagara had its birth,

 1894.]           as a Chronometer     of Geological Time.         .     147
draining   only the Erie basin. Then the Niagara river descended
200 ft.   In course of time the waters subsided 220 ft. more, but
eventually they were raised again 80 ft. at the mouth of the Niagara,
thus reducing the descent of the river, from the head of the rapids
above the falls to the foot of the last rapids in its course to the lake,
to 320 ft. During the loweststage, Ontario lake receded twelve miles
from the end of Niagara gorge, where the falls had been located at
                                                                         ‘
their nativity.
   9. Laws of Erosion—Theoretically         the erosion varies as the height
of the falls and the volume of the water, but some of the work is
converted into heat.      The recession is largely due to the work being
expended in the undermining of the hard capping rocks, by the
removal of the underlying shales.         The rate of the modern recession
has been determined under the changing conditions of erosion, so
that the theoretical variations of other portions of the river’s work
includes their modi<U+FB01>cation.
   10 and 11. Episodes of the River and the amount of Recession in each.
Duration of each Episode—First episode: Water falling 200 ft., in
volume 3/11 of modern discharge; gorge, 11,000 ft. long; duration,
17,200 years.      Second episode: river descending 420 ft., in three
cascades; <U+FB01>rst stage, only the discharge of the Erie waters; length of
chasm, 3,000 ft. ; duration, 6,000 years ; second stage, drainage of all
the upper lake; length of chasm, 7,000 ft. ; duration, 44,000 years.
Third episode: same volume and descent as in last, but the three
falls united into one fall; length of chasm, 4,000 feet; duration,
800 years.     Fourth episode : volume of water as at present, the level
of lower lake as to-da-y; <U+FB01>rst stage, a. local rapid making the descent
of 365 ft. ; work particularly hard; length of gorge, 5,500 ft.; dura
tion about 1,500 years; the second stage as at present; work easy;
length of canon, 6,000 feet; descent of water, 320 ft.; rate'of reces
sion here taken as the full measured amount of 4175 ft. a year;
duration, 1,500 years.      Thus the age of the falls is computed to be
31,000 years,   with   another  1,000 years as the age of the river before
the nativity of the Falls. The turning of the Huron waters into the
Niagara was about 8,000 years ago. A di<U+FB02>icult question was the
amount of work done in each episode.           This was in part determined
by  the  position  of  the remaining    terraces  corresponding to di<U+FB01>erent
stages  of  the river,  and  by the  changing    effects of erosion.
   12. Relations between the     Terrestrial  0r  Epeirogenic Movements and
the Falls.—The deserted beaches in the lake region have been deformed
by unequal terrestrial elevation, and this movement has caused the
changing conditions of the river in a large part, such as the turning
of the Huron waters from the Ottawa valley to the Erie basin. This
deformation affecting the Niagara district, since the commencement
of the river epoch, amounts to 2'5 ft. per mile; east of Lake Huron,

4 ft. per mile; and at the outlet of Lake Ontario, 5 ft. per mile ; all in a
north-eastward direction.      Taking the amount of movement in each
district as representing also the proportional measure of time, then
calculations can be made upon several of the beaches, and in terms of
the age of Niagara their antiquity can be inferred.           The importance
of the computations in this paper is that they support the correctness
of the calculated age of the Falls.      In the application of these results
it appears that the rate of terrestrial uplift in the Niagara district is
about 1'25 ft. a century ; 2 ft. east of Lake Huron, and 2'5 ft. at the
outlet of Lake Ontario.       Here was found the <U+FB01>rst long looked-for
indication of the rate of uplift.                                         -
    13. The Relation of Niagara Falls to Geological Time—From the
study of the deserted beaches, it appears that the commencement of
the lake epoch was as long before the birth of Niagara Falls as the
Falls are old, so that the beginning of the lake age was probably
64,000 years ago, or perhaps even 80,000 years.             Against this con
jecture we have as yet no proof. On the other hand, some suppose
the lakes to have been held in by glacial dams, continuing for long
episodes at the same level, and by the withdrawal of the glaciers
 the waters were lowered in addition to the terrestrial deformation.
With this assumption, the retreating ice continued until the end of
the Iroquois episode, or from our computations until 14,000 years
ago.    But here we need much more investigation. The present paper
is merely a contribution in a <U+FB01>eld of work in America, in which only
a few workers have so far contributed the detailed labours upon which
this study is built.
    14. The End of the Fella—From the rate of terrestrial elevation
and the rate of recession of the Falls, it appears that if the move
ments continue as they have been progressing, then before the Falls
shall have retreated to Lake Eric, the Niagara outlet will have been
deserted, and the waters of the upper lakes will discharge by way of
 Chicago into the Mississippi drainage, a change analogous to the
 turning of the Huron waters into the Erie valley from the Ottawa
 Outlet. This change might be expected 7,000—8,000 years hence.

    In a paper on “The Effects and Chemical Changes of Sugar
 injected into a Vein ”*  I   showed that when grape sugar is injected

into    the  jugular vein of a dog it causes an augmentation in the
quantity     of  lactic acid in the circulation, the quantity of the acid
steadily increasing until it reaches its maximum in about three hours
after the injection. It then gradually, hour by hour, decreases, until
in about six hours it returns to the normal amount.              The question as
to the base with which the lactic acid combines to form a lactate is,
however, still unsettled.
    The results of Walter’s* experiments, in conjunction with the
often-noticed fact that ammonia is increased in the urine of diabetes,
led me to imagine that the lactic acid combined with ammonia, until
I  found that the breaking up of sugar in the organism has no in<U+FB02>u
ence whatsoever on the amount of ammonia in the blood, and conse
quently it cannot be the base.
    It then appeared to me probable that the lactic acid had combined
with the bases of carbonates in the blood, having driven out the
carbonic acid from its compound.
    In order to try and settle this point, I estimated the quantity of
carbonic acid in the blood under different conditions.
    The series of experiments I am now about to record were performed
in the Physiological Institute at Leipzig, and I wish to express my
gratitude to Professor 0. Ludwig for the kind assistance he gave me
in the matter.
    The experiments, which were made on dogs, were conducted in the
same manner as in my previous researches, above alluded to, except
that blood was withdrawn only three times from each dog. In order
to obtain a normal standard, the <U+FB01>rst specimen of blood was taken
before the sugar was injected, the second was withdrawn in an hour,
and the third in from three to <U+FB01>ve hours after the intra-venous
injection of the sugar.
    In order that the composition of the blood might be altered as little
as possible by the. bleeding, only 30 0.0. of blood was collected each
time.
    In all cases the blood was collected under mercury from the carotid
artery.     The gases were pumped from the blood by means of a
Ludwig mercurial pump, and analysed by Bunsen’s method.
    The quantities of gases found were calculated at 0° C. and 760 mm.
of mercury, and are expressed in volumes per cent.

   The only nerve symptoms after the sugar injection were manifested
in vomiting and muscular tremors.     These were not accompanied by
coma or any other symptom.
   The quantity of carbonic acid found in the standard specimen of
blood was 37380 per cent., whereas, in that taken an hour after the
sugar injection it was only 27'006 per cent., that is to say, a diminu
tion of 10374: per cent. in the amount of carbonic acid followed upon
the intra-venous injection of the sugar, while the blood withdrawn
<U+FB01>ve hours later contained 34'357 per cent. of carbonic acid, this being
only 3'023 per cent. less than that in the standard blood.          The
carbonic acid, thus tending to return to the normal amount, showed
that the in<U+FB02>uence of the sugar-on the carbonic acid in the blood is
merely temporary.
   The quantity of oxygen in the standard blood was found to be
22280 per cent. An hour after the sugar injection it had fallen to
17'071 per cent, thus giving a diminution of 5'209 per cent.     Five
hours later it was still further decreased, being only 14886 per cent.
Consequently, in this respect the e<U+FB01>ect of the sugar on the oxygen is
di<U+FB01>erent from that upon the carbonic acid.

    The nerve symptoms following the injection of the sugar were
greater in this case. The vomiting and tremors of the limbs were
followed      by well-marked epileptic <U+FB01>ts, which, an hour later, were
succeeded by a semi-cematose condition.                       Although the animal could
still be roused, it remained in a sleepy condition up to the third
bleeding, when it was killed.
    The percentage of carbonic acid fell in the <U+FB01>rst hour after the
sugar injection, while the animal was in a drowsy condition, from
38'541 to 28042. This gives a diminution of carbonic acid of 10'499
per cent.      Four and a half hours after the injection the carbonic acid
had risen to 28'926 per cent.                    That is to say, it was 9'615 per cent.
less than the quantity found in the standard blood.
    The oxygen which originally stood at 19902 per cent. fell, in the
<U+FB01>rst hour, to 7'220 per cent.; therefore it was 12'682 per cent. less
than the normal amount. In four and a. half hours after the sugar
injection it increased to 13'968 per cent, which is only 5934 per cent.
less than the original quantity found.
    Thus it appears in this case there was a greater diminution in both
the carbonic acid and oxygen of the blood during the <U+FB01>rst hour than
in the former experiment; a result corresponding with the far greater
nerve disturbances, and no doubt due, as stated in my former paper,
to a larger percentage of sugar to bodily weight having been injected
into the circulation.          It was found in this case that the carbonic acid
was, four and a half hours after the injection of the sugar, while the
 animal was in a semi-comatose state, almost as low as during the <U+FB01>rst
 hour.      The oxygen had by this time, on the other hand, markedly
 increased in quantity.
    These results having been obtained, it was decided to withdraw the
 third portion of blood somewhat earlier after the sugar injection than
 in the foregoing cases.

siness in this case passed 01f before the third bleeding.
   In the standard specimen of blood the carbonic acid was 42260 per
cent., and an hour after the intra-venous injection of the sugar it
fell to 33075 per cent., being a decrease of 9'185 per cent. The
third portion of blood taken in three hours, that is to say after the
drowsiness had passed off, was found to contain 38000 per cent. of
carbonic acid, a decrease from the normal of 4'260 per cent.
   The specimen of oxygen from the normal blood was lost.                                   The
quantity found an hour after was 10217 per cent., and three hours

 there were no epileptic seizures.                Sleepiness, however, came on later,
 and was marked at the time of the third bleeding.
    In the <U+FB01>rst specimen of blood the quantity of carbonic acid was
 39'520 per cent., and it diminished during the <U+FB01>rst hour after the
 sugar injection to ,32'140 per cent., being a decrease of 7'380 per
 cent.     Three hours after the injection of the sugar, the carbonic
 acid fell still further, it being then only 27'725 per cent., that is to
 say 14'795 per cent. less than the original amount.                            ‘
    The oxygen, which at the beginning was 160% per cent., de
 creased during the <U+FB01>rst hour to 15'561 per cent., being a loss of
 0464 per cent.          By the third hour it again rose to 17767 per cent.,
 that being 17412 per cent. more than was found in the normal blood.
    As in Experiment 2, this dog had become semi-comatose by the
 third bleeding, the carbonic acid being then even less than what it
 was during the <U+FB01>rst hour.

    Having now brie<U+FB02>y given the results met with in each separate
experiment,     I will now consider the results as a whole.
    In the <U+FB01>rst place, we see there was a decrease in the quantity of
carbonic acid in all the different specimens of blood during the <U+FB01>rst
hour after the sugar was injected, the diminutions being 10374,
10499, 9185, and 7'380 per cent.
    In the second place, the blood, taken <U+FB01>ve hours after the sugar was
injected, showed a decrease of 3'023 and 9'615 per cent. (in Experi
ments 1 and 2) '; while after three hours there was a decrease of
4'260 per cent. (in Experiment 3). In all the three cases it had
therefore shown, during the later hours, a more or less marked
tendency to return to the normal amount.                    In Experiment 4 the
blood at the third hour contained 14795 per cent. less carbonic acid
than the normal blood, and 4415 per cent. less than what it con
tained at the <U+FB01>rst hour. This discrepancy may be due to the fact
that a greater percentage of sugar was injected, and the dog was in
consequence rendered more comatose.                  This view seems the more
likely, as in Experiment 2, when the dog was semi-comatose, the
carbonic acid was markedly diminished at the <U+FB01>fth hour.*
    These united results support the view that the lactic acid derived
from the splitting up of the sugar in the animal body drives off
the carbonic acid from the sodium salts and replaces it.                   This view
is still further supported by the fact that the quantity of carbonic
acid in the blood withdrawn at the different periods after the sugar
injection, varied in the same manner as the quantity of lactic acid
had been found to do.               In both cases during the <U+FB01>rst hour after
the sugar injection, one <U+FB01>nds larger quantities than during the later
hours.
    Whether the percentage decrease in the amount of the carbonic
acid hinders its elimination by the lungs or not will depend upon
how much power the combined lactic acid has of hindering the blood
from taking up the carbonic acid from the tissues and the tension of
the existing gas.
    This point would         be ascertained by estimating the quantity of
carbonic acid expired after the sugar injection.                 The experiments    I
have already publishedf on this point show that there is no decrease
in the amount of carbonic acid expired from an animal immediately
after sugar has been injected into its circulation.                In fact there was
an actual increase of carbonic acid in all but one case}: during the
<U+FB01>rst hour.

   There was a marked decrease of carbonic acid during the later
hours in those cases which su<U+FB02>ered from coma.
   It would thus seem that in those cases when there are no nervous
symptoms caused by the intra-venous injection' of sugar, while the
quantity of lactic acid is at its highest and the quantity of carbonic
acid in the blood is at its lowest, more carbonic acid is expired than
before the injection of the sugar.
   An explanation to this fact, if it really exists, is at the present
moment impossible. In order to settle this point it would be neces
sary in the same animal to make all the analyses at the same time;
which would be impossible without an exceptionally large dog, as
the quantity of blood needed would cause of itself changes in the
metabolism.
   In the next place the changes met with in the quantity of oxygen
in the blood are still more surprising, as there is no known reason
Why haemoglobin should not take up the usual amount of oxygen as
it does in health after the intra-venous injection of sugar.
   In all of the experiments the quantity of oxygen is seen to have
been markedly diminished during the <U+FB01>rst hour after the sugar in
jection.
   In three of them it fell 0'464, 3'209, and 12682 per cent. below the
normal standard during the <U+FB01>rst hour. This result can be partially
explained by the in<U+FB02>uence of the endosmotic <U+FB02>ow of the juices of the
tissues into the circulating blood, which is known to occur when the
quantity of sugar in the blood is increased. For in a series of similar
experiments Brasol’l“ found that during the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>ve minutes after
the injection of sugar the proteids of the serum were reduced to even
below one half of their previous amount, while one or two hours
after the injection the proteids had, as a rule, returned to the normal
amount.
    During the third and <U+FB01>fth hours after the sugar injection it will be
 noticed that the quantity of oxygen in the arterial blood was 14'886,
 13'968, 14'569, and 17'767 per cent. ; that is to say the quantity that
is usually found in venous blood.
    The diminution in the quantity of oxygen, even from three to <U+FB01>ve
 hours after the sugar injection, cannot therefore be explained on a
 dilution theory.

                                      (Abstract)
   The phenomenon of dimorphism is now known to be presented by
many different species of Foraminifera.
   The individuals of a species fall into two groups. In one the
central chamber (the Megasphere of Munier-Chalmas and Schlum
berger) is of considerable size, while in the other it is small (Micro
sphe're).  These two forms of a species may be distinguished as the
Megalosjoheric and Microspheric forms.
   They have been shown to di<U+FB02>'er, not only in the size of the central
chamber, but, in some instances (Miliolidae), in the plan on which
the chambers are arranged, in the size attained by the full-grown
shell, and also in the frequency of their occurrence, the megalospherie
form being much the more abundant.
   It has been suggested that the different conditions under which
 Orbulina universa is found represent the megalospheric and micro_
spheric forms, but the reasons urged in favour of this view appear
inconclusive.
                              Polystomella crispa
   With the hope of throwing light on the life history of the
Foraminifera, a large number of specimens of this species have been
examined.
   Like so many others, it is dimorphic.     Though the two forms are
indistinguishable   when  the shell is complete, on examining decalci<U+FB01>ed
and stained specimens they may be at once referred to one form or
the other. The central chamber of the megalospheric form is gener
ally about 80 in diameter, while that of the microspheric form is
              ,u.
about 10 ,u.   Associated with the di<U+FB02>’erence in the size of the central
chambers    there   a marked di<U+FB01>'erence in the nuclei of the two forms.

The relative frequency of the megalospheric form to the microspheric
in 1812 examples,      as 34 to
                         is            1.
   In the Microsphe'ric form numbers of small nuclei are present,
scattered through the protoplasm, but not extending into the terminal
chambers.      Those in the inner chamber are smaller than those
situated further on. The nuclei contain nucleoli of different sizes
lying in an apparently homogeneous internucleolar substance.       It
shown that the nuclei increase in number by simple division, and
                                                                           it is
appears probable that they are so derived from a. single nucleus.

156                Mr.  J. J. Lister.   Contributions to        [June  7,
After maintaining their rounded form for a certain time, the nuclei
give 05 portions of their substance into the surrounding protoplasm.
This process appears to begin in the innermost chambers, but it ex
tends to the nuclei in the outermost chambers, and ultimately the
whole of the nuclear material is distributed through the protoplasm
in the form, in preserved specimens, of irregularly branched and
deeply staining strands. Of the further history of the microspheric
form I have no clear evidence.
   The lllegalosphe'ricform during the vegetative period of its life has
a single large nucleus, which grows in size with the growth of the
protoplasm, and passes on from chamber to chamber, moving to
wards the centre of the protoplasm contained in the series of
chambers, though lagging some distance short of it. It consists of
a nuclear reticulum, nucleoli which occupy the nodes of the reticu
lum, and of a substance occupying the meshes.        The nucleoli appear
to increase in number and diminish in size with the advance of the
organism.     There is reason to believe that as the nucleus moves on
through the chambers portions of its substance are given oif into the
protoplasm.     It appears that this may occur either by the separation
of considerable portions, sometimes containing several nucleoli, which
lie strewn along the track of the nucleus, or by the dispersal of
minute fragments into the surrounding protoplasm, causing in
stained specimens a <U+FB02>ush in the neighbourhood of the nucleus.         In
some specimens the nucleus has lost its rounded form, and sends
irregular processes into the protoplasm. Its staining properties are
at the same time diminished. It appears probable that these nuclei
are such as have given off a large part of their substances as above
described, and are now in process of dissolution.
   In the reproductive phase no large nucleus is present, but hosts of
minute nuclei (1—2 In in diameter) are found scattered through the
protoplasm. At the same time broad channels of communication
have become opened up, setting the inner chambers in direct com
munication with the outer.
   At <U+FB01>rst the small nuclei are most abundant in the terminal cham
bers, but ultimately they become uniformly distributed through the
protoplasm. They then divide by karyokinesis, the protoplasm being
aggregated about them in spherical masses, 3'5u in diameter, each of
which contains a dividing nucleus.
   At a later stage each nucleus, presumably the daughter-nuclei of
this division, becomes the centre of a <U+FB01>agellated spore.   These spores
are all of approximately equal size, in other words, they are isospo'res.
   In one instance spores of a different character were observed
escaping. These were anisospores.        They consisted of macroapores,
globular bodies having a diameter of ll—lOu, and with indica
tions of a <U+FB02>agellum, and microspm'es of a globular or oval shape, from

6—1 p in diameter and provided with two <U+FB02>agella, one longer than the
other, rising close together from the body of the spore. I am unable to
say whether the parent of these spores was megalospheric or micro
spheric, but as the isospores are produced by the individuals of the
former type it is possible that the anisospores belong to those of the
latter.
                        Orbitolites complanata,  Lamk.
    In the Microsphem'c form, the centre of the disc is occupied
by small chambers.        Numbers of rounded nuclei are distributed
through the protoplasm, often in pairs, and in some cases they may
be seen to be united by a constricted band, as though in process of
simple division.     Larger solitary nuclei with a well marked reticulum
are also present.
    In the later stages of growth large brood chambers are formed at
the periphery of the disc, which Brady found to be crowded with
young (“primitive discs ”) of the megalospheric form. Examination
of specimens preserved in spirit in which the young are present in the
brood chambers, shows that the inner part of the shell is empty, its
contents being represented only by the young. A large nucleus is
                 “                         ”
present in the     primordial chambers of the young discs.
    The centre of the Megalosphem'c form is occupied by the “ primitive
disc.”    This consists of a large “primordial chamber ” (the megalo
sphere), which is usually pyriform, and measures about 100” in
                                               “ circumambient
length, surrounded by the very large                           chamber.”
The small chambers of the remainder of the disc are arranged about
the primitive disc in rings.
    The nucleus which, as has been said, occupies the primordial
chamber in the young form, maintains that position during a large
part of the growth of the shell. Ultimately it appears to break up
into irregular fragments, which become dispersed through the adjoin
ing chambers.
    The specimens of this form from Celebes have all attained a larger
 size than those from Tonga and Fiji. In three cases (out of 114) the
protoplasm has left the central region of the disc, and is massed in
 brood chambers at the periphery in the form of megalospheric young,
 exactly resembling in shape and size those borne by the microspheric
 form.   It is thus established that both the megalospheric and micro
 spheric forms of Orbitolz'tes under certain circumstances, produce
young of the megalospheric type.
    An examination of specimens of Rotalia beccan'i Linn.), Truncat
 ulina lobatula, Walker and Jacob, Calcari'na hispida, Brady, and Cyclo
 clypeus has furnished evidence of the relation of nuclear characters
 to the two forms of a species analogous to that obtained in
 Polystomella.

                          S umma'ry and Conclusions.
   The following statements relating to the life-history of the For
aminifera appear to be justi<U+FB01>ed :—
    1. The species are in a great number of cases dimorphic.           The
dimorphism has been stated to exist in twenty-three genera, belong
ing to four out of the ten families into which Brady divided the
group.
   2. The two forms differ from one another—
       (a) In  the size of the central chamber.    Their difference in this
           respect   is in many cases very marked but may be slight
            ( Tmmcatulz'na).
       (b) In the  shape and mode of growth of the chambers succeeding
           the megalosphere and microsphere.
      (c) In the character of their nuclei. In this paper it is shown
           that in several species the microspheric form has many com
           paratively small nuclei, while the megalospheric form has a
           single large nucleus.
   3. The megalospheric form of a species is much more numerous
than the microspheric.
   4. The megalospheric form has been seen to arise in some cases (at
least seven genera) as a young individual already invested by a shell,
produced in the terminal or peripheral chambers of the parent.
While in some cases (Orbitolites) the parent of such megalospheric
young was microspheric, in others (Peneroplz's, O'rbitolites) it was
megalospheric.
   5. Foraminifera, in certain conditions, give rise to active swarm
cells.
   These have been previously recorded in Gromz'a and Cymbalopora.
In Polystomella the protoplasm of a megalospheric form was found
broken up into swarm cells of uniform size (isospores), and similar
bodies in a <U+FB02>agellated condition have been seen escaping.
   The production of anisospores has been recorded in Miliola
 (Schneider), and it occurs also in Polystomella as stated above.
   The question has arisen: are the two forms of the Foraminifera
distinct from their origin,      or is one a modi<U+FB01>cation of the other?
The following reasons may be urged for rejecting the latter
hypothesis :—
   Among the Miliolidae the plan of growth is often entirely di<U+FB02>erent
in the two forms. The hypothesis of modi<U+FB01>cation would in this case
require a remodelling of the whole shell.
   If such modi<U+FB01>cation were to occur, various stages in the replace
ment of the megalosphere by small chambers should be found.              So
        I
far as am aware such stages have not been found.

      While the megalospheric form is not found in process of transition
  into the microspheric, it is found, either with the protoplasm broken
  up into swarm cells (Polystomella), or containing megalospheric
  young in the peripheral chambers, while the central chambers are
'
  empty (Orbitolites). In both cases the megalosphere remained un
  absorbed at the centre of the shell.
      The microspheric form is found in the young condition.
      The nuclear characters of the two forms are, at any rate, in the
  species which    I  have examined, quite distinct.
      It appears then that it may safely be concluded that the microspheric
  and megalospheric forms are distinct from their origin.
      What then is their relationship P
      When two forms of a species are met with in animals or plants
  they generally either represent different sexes, or they are members of
                                                                      ‘
  a recurring cycle of generations.
      The hypothesis that the two forms of the Foraminifera represent
  the two sexes appears to be disproved by the fact that in 'Orbitol'ites
  complanata, both megalospheric and microspheric forms are found
   with the young of the megalospheric form (primitive discs) in their
   brood chambers. Other genera furnish analogous, though less com
   plete evidence.      Hence it is .impossible to regard either form as
   male.
      We turn then to the other hypothesis that the two forms are
   members of a recurring cycle of generations.              On this view it is
   necessary to suppose, from the evidence afforded by Orbitolites com
  planata, in which both microspheric and megalospheric forms have
   been found with the young of the megalospheric form in their
   brood chambers, that the megalospheric form may, at any rate in
   some genera, be repeated for one or more generations, before the
   microspheric form recurs.         No evidence of such a repetition has,
   however, been furnished by the examination of Polystomella.
      The view that the life-history of the Foraminifera comprises more'
   than one generation is in harmony with the fact that the nuclear
   history of the two forms in Polystomella, so far as it has been ob
   served, presents resemblances to that which Brandt has recently
   described in Thalassicola among the Radielaria.          In this group, as is
   well  known,  the   individuals  of a  species fall into  two sets, those pro
   ducing isospores and those producing anisospores, which are regarded
   as an asexual generation alternating with a sexual.
      The simultaneous division of nuclei by karyokinesis immediately
   before the formation of the reproductive elements which was ob
   served in the megalospheric form of Polystomella is a phenomenon of
    very general occurrence. A similar division has been show to occur

in  several genera of the Mycetozoa immediately before the formation
of the spores, and it appears probable that the phenomenon is akin
to the division of the micro-nucleus which precedes conjugation in
the Iiifusoria, and to the division of nuclei which occurs in               the

l. “ The Molecular Surface-energy of the Esters, showing its
        Variation with Chemical Constitution.”               By Professor W.
        RAMSAY,    Ph.D., F.R.S., and Miss EMILY ASTON, B.Sc.
        Received“ April 26, 1894.
   The investigation of the thermal relations of a series of esters by
Professor "Young" has made it possible to determine their molecular
surface-energies between ordinary temperature and their critical
points; for the two important constants required for the. calculation
of these properties, the densities of the liquids and of their vapours
in the saturated state (their orthobaric volumes) have been carefully
determined by him. Professor Young has had the kindness to place
his specimens at our disposal; their purity is suf<U+FB01>ciently guaranteed
by the proofs a<U+FB01>orded in his paper. Before using them they were
tested for acidity, to ensure that no hydrolysis had occurred during
accidental exposure ; but in no case was the reaction acid.
    The chief question to which an answer was sought was: Do these
bodies con<U+FB01>rm the general law of which experimental proof was fur
nished by one of the authors in conjunction with Dr. Shields, which
 may be thus stated—
    At approximately equal internals of temperature below their critical
 temperatures all normal liquids possess equal molecular surface-energy .7
    The analogy of this law with that of Boyle is very striking; the
 latter may be expressed in almost identical terms—

    At  equal intervals of temperature above absolute zero all normal  gases
 possess equal molecular  volume-energy.
                                     ”
    By “molecular volume-energy is understood the product of pres
 sure into molecular volume, that is, into the volume occupied by the
 molecular weight of the gas taken in grams ; while molecular surface
 energy signi<U+FB01>es the product of surface-tension and molecular-surface,
 that is, the surface on which equal numbers of molecules are supposed
 to be uniformly distributed, equal to the two-thirds power of the
 molecular volume of the liquid.
    The apparatus employed for low temperatures was that <U+FB01>gured in the
 ‘
   Transactions of the Chemical Society,’ vol. 63, p. 1094. A double set
 of observations was made, each set with a dilferent capillary tube.
 One of the tubes was accidentally broken during the experiments,
and was replaced by one of approximately the same radius. The radii,
as described in a previous paper, were measured by means of a micro
scope with micrometer eye-piece ; tube A had a radius of 001843 mm. ;
tube B of 001708 mm. ; and tube 0 of 001046 mm.            These measure
ments were con<U+FB01>rmed by determining the ascent of pure benzene in
the tubes at known temperatures, and this is, on the whole, the easiest
and most accurate method of determining their diameters.
    For higher temperatures, the apparatus, described in the ‘ Philo
sophical Transactions,’ 1893, A, p. 662, was employed. In order to
apply a correction for the capillary rise in the barometer-tube in
which the capillary tube D was con<U+FB01>ned, a determination was made
with each ester at some temperature (usually the boiling point of
alcohol under atmospheric pressure) at which capillary rise had been
determined in a wide tube with tube A, B, or C, where correction was
unnecessary, the ascent being taken, as customary, in inverse propor
tion to the radii of the tubes.    As the variation of capillary rise with
temperature is approximately a linear one, a suf<U+FB01>ciently accurate
correction may be obtained by assuming a rectilinear relation. Thus,
for example, if at 78° the rise in the wide tube was 30 mm., and in
the narrow tube 27 mm., it was necessary to add 3 mm. to the rise in
the narrow tube at that temperature. At the critical temperature
the correction is, of course, zero, since at that temperature there is no
capillary ascent in any tube.         It was held that this di<U+FB01>erence
decreased in the barometer tube proportionately with rise of tempera
ture, so that, for example, if the critical temperature were 278°, at
the temperature 178° the correction applied amounted to 1'5 mm.
    We regarded it as unnecessary to increase labour by taking ob
servations at each 10° rise of temperature, since a few points on the
curve serve to show whether the rectilinear relation holds. The plan
of experiment was as follows :—The pressure tube containing the
capillary tube was heated in the vapour of chlorobenzene, boiling
under atmospheric pressure about 132°, the exact temperature
                                                                  it 2

naturally depending        on the barometric pressure of the day.      As none
of the esters boiled much above 100° at atmospheric pressure, it was
possible by lowering pressure to cause them to boil at 132°, especially
as in <U+FB01>lling the tube a trace of air was purposely left in the liquid.
It is not necessary that this air should be visible as a bubble, but it is
suf<U+FB01>cient if the liquid is not thoroughly boiled in vacuo.              It may
appear strange that such a course was followed, but repeated expe
rience has shown that if a liquid is wholly deprived of dissolved gas
by boiling it in vacuo, it is impossible to cause it to boil, even at
atmospheric pressure, although heated to 100“ above its normal
boiling point.
    Having determined the capillary rise at 132°, the pressure in the
jacket was lowered, so as to cause the chlorobenzene to boil at 78° or
80°, care being taken not to allow the gas present in the upper part of
the tube to condense wholly.              The rise was again noted.   The tube
 was then jacketed with quinoline vapour at about 185°, as well as at
higher temperatures, and readings were again taken.               Some six or
seven points on the curve were thus determined, a suf<U+FB01>cient number
 to characterise it.
     It will conduce to clearness to give the essential data at this stage,
 reserving details of experiment to the Appendix, where they are
 tabulated. For completeness’ sake, the results previously published
 in the ‘ Philosophical Transactions ’ for methyl formate and for ethyl
 acetate are here included.
     As the molecular surface-energy of a liquid, provided it does not
 dissociate with rise of temperature, may be calculated by means of the

   It  is evident at the <U+FB01>rst glance that it is the acid radical which
determines the value of k, for it increases progressively with the pro
gressive increase of its molecular weight.                        Young has noticed a
similar relation to hold with the ratios of absolute temperatures at
corresponding pressures to absolute critical temperatures, but in other
relations which he has investigated, there does not appear to be any
                                                                                     '
analogous regularity.
   As regards the values of d, they appear to <U+FB02>uctuate as the series
is ascended in the order of complexity of acid radical, but too great
dependence must not be placed on the values given.                          A very small
change in It would make a considerable difference in the value to be
assigned to d.
   An attempt has been made to ascertain whether molecular volumes
admit of more regular comparison at temperatures at which mole
cular surface-energies are equal.              This appears, however, not to be
the case. Thus, at the value 390 ergs, the group of four isomerides
gives the following numbers :—
                  4       Ester.                              Molecular volume.

                   Propyl  acetate   ...... . ........              12716
    The agreement       is no better      than at their boiling             points under
normal pressure.
    An   attempt has also been made to <U+FB01>nd whether the boiling points
at corresponding      pressures bear a constant ratio to the temperatures
of equal molecular surface-energy. Taking that ratio of pressure to
critical pressure given in the <U+FB01>fth line of the table on p. 1245 of the
paper in the ‘Transactions,’ and dividing the corresponding tem

    These numbers may be roughly arranged into four groups : methyl
formate, the isomerides of the formula C,HSOQ, those of the formula
O‘HBOZ, and those of the formula 0611100,.                They suf<U+FB01>ce to show that
the molecular surface-energies are not comparable for non-isomeric
bodies at corresponding pressures.
    It must, therefore, be concluded that, although a certain rough
analogy exists between the corresponding temperatures and pressures
of the esters and their molecular surface-energy, yet the causes
which determine deviation from the deductions from the equations
of condition for <U+FB02>uids, are still more operative in causing deviations
when surface forces are under consideration.
    These experiments add eight more compounds to the list of six
given in the Phil. Trans.,’ 1893,A, p. 662, showing that within wide
                ‘
limits of temperature the molecular surface-energy of non-associating
compounds is a linear function of the temperature-;                  and as the law
has been found to hold between more restricted limits of temperature
for other thirty (‘ Trans. Chem. Soc.’, Vol. 63, p. 1191), it may be
taken as placed on a <U+FB01>rm basis.
    A certain number of substances, among which are to be found the
alcohols and the acids, show deviation from this law. Reserving to
another occasion the grounds for inferring that this deviation points to
molecular complexity, it is advisable to inquire here whether it is legi
timate to assume for compounds which follow the law that their mole
cular weight in the state of liquid is the same as that of their gases.
    Strictly speaking, the conclusion does not follow.                  The similar
form of the surface-energy equation to that expressing volume-energy
is a mere analogy; there is no physical connexion as yet manifest
between the two<U+FB01>"         There is no positive evidence to show that the
molecules of such liquids as follow the law do not associate in twos,
0r threes, on assuming the liquid state.              But one thing is certain, if
they do, all associate to an equal extent, and the degree of associa
tion is not altered by rise of temperature.
   * This conclusion  must  be modi<U+FB01>ed       in view of the recent memoir  by van der
Waals (see p. 181).

1894.]     The Molecular Surface-energy      of the Esters, <§-c.       167
    These two assertions are probably not true; it is unlikely that
mere liquefaction should produce in all cases equal association; and
it is unlikely that a rise of temperature should not cause the dissocia
tion of an associated body.      Change from the gaseous to the liquid
state may be regarded as essentially equivalent to increase of pres
sure, since each produces approach between the molecules, diminish
ing intermolecular distance, and bringing so-called chemical forces
into play. Now it is well known that equal rise of pressure does not
always produce equal increment of association; hence it is unlikely
that association to an equal extent should be caused by the reduction
of the volumes of compounds until they are approximately equal.
    This kind of proof is not unknown to chemists; it is employed,
tacitly perhaps, in the fundamental statement that the molecular
formula; of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, &c., are H2, 02, and N 2. On
this basis rests the usually accepted molecular formulae of all com
pounds, and they are accepted because they are the simplest expres
sions which admit of equations of chemical interchange being
written.     It is true that subsequently to the adoption of such a
 standard its justice was con<U+FB01>rmed by Kundt and Warburg’s deter
mination of the ratio between the speci<U+FB01>c heats of mercury gas at
constant pressure and at constant volume, thereby rendering it ex
 tremely probable that the molecular formula of mercury is Hg,, and
 consequently that of hydrogen H2; and by the discovery by Victor
Meyer that the molecular formula of iodine at high temperatures cor
responds with 11. But such con<U+FB01>rmations merely supported the
generally received assumption (for assumption it was then) that the
molecular formqu of most gases are directly comparable with that of
hydrogen as H2.
    Even at this present date the doctrine of the uniform expansion of
gases at high temperatures rests on a similar basis.         It has been
shOWn by Victor Meyer that at the highest temperature attainable in
a gas-furnace—some 1700°~hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen 'main“
tain the same ratio of expansion towards each other. One of two
conclusions follows :—either that the expansion of all three gases is
uniform with increase of temperature, or that all three gases dis
sociate equally with equal rise of temperature.      Needless to say that
the  <U+FB01>rst alternative is universally adopted.
   We have thought it well to state in full the reasons for adopting
the assumption that the molecular weights of such liquids as the
esters are not changed on their assuming the liquid state.        It is now
evident that such a statement is an assumption, a hypothesis ; but it
is one for which there is a great deal of probability, probability of
the same kind as that which led to the adoption of the usually
received molecular formulae for gases.

II.    “ The Complexity and the Dissociation                            of the Molecules 0f
        Liquids.” By Professor W. RAMSAY,                               Ph.D., F.R.S.   Re
        ceived April   26, 1894.
   Since the publication of a research on the molecular complexity of
liquids by Ramsay and Shields (‘ Trans. Chem. Soc.,’ vol. 63, p. 1191)
two questions have arisen :—First: What other evidence is there as
to the existence of complex molecules in certain liquids P
   Second: How can the amount of dissociation of associating liquids
be inferred from measurements of their surface-energy?
   The <U+FB01>rst of these questions has been treated of by Professor
Philippe Guye, in the ‘Archives des Sciences Physiques et Naturelles
de Genéve,’ 31 ; and as that periodical is not easily accessible    to
English readers, a short account of his article is given here.
       I. Evidence in favour of         the    Molecular Complexity           of Certain
                                            Liquids.
  a.  Guye has shown (‘ Annales,’ vol. 31, [6], p. 206) that the quotient
obtained by dividing the absolute critical temperature of a liquid by
the critical pressure measured in atmospheres          is equal to the
molecular refraction of the liquid multiplied by a factor which is
approximately equal to 1'8.     His reason for this statement is as
follows :—Equations such as that of van der Waals, which express
approximately the constants for gases and liquids in terms of temper
ature, pressure, and volume, assume as one of their data the “co
 volume” (1)) of the substance; i.e., a number proportional to the
actual volume of the molecules, supposing them to he spherical. The
dielectric constant of a body                10,
                                  according to Clausius, depends on
the ratio u of the real volume to the apparent volume occupied by
the molecules, in such a manner that
                             u    = (k—1)/(k+2).
Maxwell has shown that according to the electro- magnetic theory of
light, the dielectric constant    should be equal to the square of
                                        It

multiplied by a constant, be equal to the molecular refraction.
   While the majority of substances examined by Guye appear to
consist of simple molecular groups at their critical points, water,
methyl alcohol, and acetic acid yield numbers which point to associa
tion, inasmuch as the constant    instead of having its usual value 1‘8,

found by multiplying their theoretical densities by a number approxi
mately equal to 3‘85 (Young and Thomas, Trans. Chem. Soc.,’ 1893,
                                                                        ‘

methyl alcohol, for example, were represented by the simple formula
CH4O. Here, again, the evidence points to complex moleculesat the
                                                                 '

1894.]             Dissociation  of the Molecules of Liquids.               173
     c.  Oailletet and Matthias have suggested a simple plan for <U+FB01>nding
'the true volume of a substance        at its critical point. It consists in
mapping the densities in the state of liquid and of gas against
temperature (as seen, for example, in the diagram given by Ramsay
and Young in their memoir on alcohol in the ‘ Philosophical Transac
tions,’ 1886, Part I, plate 7), and bisecting the lines of equal pressure,
 which cross the diagram horizontally.         Such lines are lines of equal
 pressure at constant temperature. On joining the points where the
 lines are bisected, a straight line is obtained in the case of most
 liquids, which, when continued vertically, cuts the curve at the
critical density. But to this rule Young and Thomas <U+FB01>nd that water,
 and methyl, ethyl, and propyl alcohols are exceptions, for they give
 curved lines. These substances are not associated in the state of
 gas, although in the liquid state they display association.            Acetic
 acid,   however,   which displays association both     in the state of  liquid
 and of gas, gives a line which is, if not quite, at least very nearly
 straight.
      It may therefore be concluded that while a curqu line implies
 association in the state of liquid, a straight line implies either no
association or association in both conditions.
      d. The heat required to vaporise a dissociating liquid is employed
 in two ways when the gas, as is always the case, has a simpler
 molecular formula than the liquid.           A portion of the heat is em
 ployed    in  ‘vaporisation alone; while   a portion is absorbed in effecting
 the decomposition of complex molecular groups.                  The heat of
  vaporisation alone diminishes as temperature rises, till at the critical
 point it is zero ; but the heat required to dissociate molecular groups
  may increase, if that term is of importance, and may cause the
  total heat to increase.       The researches of ~Ramsay and Young on
 ethyl alcohol and on acetic acid have shown that there exist maxima
  in the heats of vaporisation of these substances.           Thus at 0°, the
  heat of vaporisation of ethyl alcohol is 2209 cal.; at 10°, 2212;
 .at 20°, 2206; and at 30°, 2201.            The numbers then decrease as
  usual. With acetic acid at 80°, the value is 91'6 cal. ; at 100°, 92'3;
  at 110°, 928; at 120°, 927; at 130°, 92'4, and so on. It may be
  stated, then, that when the numbers representing heats of vaporisa
  'tion of a compound increase to a maximum, and then diminish, the
  compound contains complex molecules in the liquid state. It does
  not follow that all substances which possess complex liquid molecules
  must exhibit such a maximum, for this peculiarity evidently depends
  on the relative importance of the heats of dissociation and of vapori
  sation.
      e. The curves representing the vapour pressures of non-dissociating
  liquids do not cut one another at any point in their course.         Liquids
  which associate give vapour-pressure curves which cut some of those

  liquids.    The fact, then, that the vapour-pressure curve of a liquid
  cuts those of undeniably simple substances, such as benzene, carbon
  tetrachloride, &c., may be taken as a proof that that liquid contains
  complex molecules.

     Other relations besides those mentioned by Guye, of Whose
 memoir the preceding pages give an abstract, also point towards
the molecular complexity of the alcohols and acids.              Among them
may be mentioned the ratios of the volumes of saturated vapour at
some chosen pressure to that at the critical pressure, as shown in
p. 1257 of Young’s memoir (loc. cit); the greater values of the ex
pression (dp/dt)T for the alcohols and for water compared with those
of other substances (see Ramsay and Young, ‘ Proc. Phys. Soc.,’ VII,
p. 303); this really means the greater heat of vaporisation for unit
increase of volume, for (dp/dt)T is equivalent to L/(Sl—Sz).                 This

fact indeed is pointed out in the <U+FB01>rst part of the series of papers
(ibid., 291). Again the ratios of total to external work produced on
evaporation (ibid., 293) show that the total work is a higher multiple
of the external work or work employed in expansion against pressure,
in the case of the alcohols, acetic acid, and water, than in the case of'
other compounds.
   Enough has been said to show that a great mass of evidence exists
in favour of molecular complexes in certain liquids. It remains now
to consider the methods by which the degree of complexity can be
ascertained.
[1. Methods of Deduciug         the Molecular Complexity of Liquids from
           Measurements        of their Molecular Surface-energy.
   Itwas shown by Ramsay and Shields (‘ Phil. Trans,’ 1893, A, 662)
that the relation of molecular surface-energy of many liquids to
temperature may be expressed by the equation
                               r1   (Mv<U+FB01> =           717(7—61),
where q is surface-tension, measured in dynes, (Mv)§ the molecular
surface measured in square centimetres, h is an approximate constant
for most liquids varying little from 2'12, and 1' is the temperature
numbered downwards from the critical point ; d is a nearly constant
number of degrees, usually 5°, which must be subtracted from '1'.
   For liquids which associate, such as the alcohols and fatty acids,
the value of k is not constant, but increases with rise of temperature.
   The problem is, knowing the average value of k for non-associating
liquids, to deduce the average molecular weights of associating liquids.
at any given temperature.

 for non-associating liquids; or, if we insert a term at, to represent a
 factor with which the gaseous or normal molecular weight of a liquid.
 should be multiplied in order that the normal value of                                It   should result

                   on this
 referred to for the alcohols, the acids, and water were calculated.
    The numbers obtained were, however, as will be shown, much in
 excess of the truth.
   An attempt was made to approximate to the true value of x, by
calculating     by means of equation (4) approximately, and using the
                   it
results obtained to correct equation (3), by inserting the neglected
 second term.    This was found to be impossible, and to lead to absurd
results; hence        was inferred that the variation of x with tem

paid to the second term of equation (3). At the same time it was
noticed in mapping a: that its alteration with temperature was
approximately linear; and this fact greatly simpli<U+FB01>ed the problem.
   Mr. J. Rose-Innes, who has taken much interest in this work, and
has on several occasions given valuable assistance, was kind enough
to endeavour to <U+FB01>nd an expression which would satisfy these condi<
tions.

  It may be remarked that at temperatures within 20 or 30 degrees
of the critical point the former no longer accurately expresses the
results. This is not peculiar to associating compounds, as has already
been shown in the ‘Phil. Trans.,’ loc. cit., p. 657.     Should it be
desired to secure more accurate correspondence between the found
data near the critical temperatures and those calculated, the last term
may be modi<U+FB01>ed. The equation then becomes

     It is, of course, easy to include the “ 7t” term, when       :0 follows, as
 before.
     There can,   I think, be no doubt that this method gives a correct
 value to the factor of association, within certain limits. These limits
 are conditioned by the fact that the number chosen for k, viz., 2121,
 is not absolutely constant, but varies with the nature of the com
 pound. The extreme variation found for the fourteen substances
 which have been most carefully investigated is between 2'020 for ethyl
 formate, and 2248 for methyl isobutyrate.            On the assumption that
 this is the extreme divergence, there may be an error of 5 per cent. in
 a negative or positive direction caused by assuming the mean value
2121.
    But there is another assumption involved in such calculations. It
is that a mixture of two liquids possesses such a molecular surface
energy that the mean molecular weight of the mixture, calculated
from the proportion in which they are present in the mixture, shall
be deducible from the molecular surface-energy.              It is conceivable
that the surface of such a mixture should not exhibit the same dis
tribution of molecules as the interior, and evidence is required to
show that the assumption that it does is correct. This evidence is
given in another communication, and it appears therefore that the
assumption is justi<U+FB01>ed.

    With these premises, therefore, proceed to give the molecular
association of methyl and ethyl alcohols, water, and acetic acid.

   Since the foregoing pages were written, Professor van der Waals
has published a long memoir on the “Thermodynamic                Theory of
Capillarity   on  the Assumption of Continuous Change of Density”
(‘Zeitschrift fiir physikalische Chemie,’ vol. 13, pp. 657—725). On
the main part of his work           I have no criticism to offer; but on
p. 714:, he states some objections to the method previously employed
by Ramsay and Shields in calculating the factor of association at.
These remarks are fully justi<U+FB01>ed, as will have been seen from the
preceding pages of this paper; but in the formula which he suggests
to replace it, he makes an assumption which, at <U+FB01>rst sight, is no less
untenable than our assumption that the factor of association, as, does
not vary with temperature.         In placing the factor of association as
equal to unity at temperatures near the critical temperature, he
obtains the formula
                           a  _ Mii'lI'Y—(M         ’
                                       a (Mv)‘
and, inasmuch as this assumption is apparently very nearly true for
methyl and ethyl alcohols and for acetic acid, the numbers he gives
are nearly identical with those in the last table of this paper.       But
they differ in the case of water, and a', according to him, is equal to
1'9, instead of to 1707.
   The formula given by him on p. 716 to calculate ry yields remark
ably good results.      In fact, if r/ be calculated for ether at —89'8°, a
result is obtained identical with that found.       This result was unfore
seen by van der Waals, for the value for q, 30'65, was not given by
us at that low temperature in our previous paper.
   Professor van der Waals, however, makes two criticisms which
appear to me to be hardly justi<U+FB01>ed.         The <U+FB01>rst refers to a correction
applied by us in order to allow for the capillarity in the wider, yet
still narrow, tube in which the capillary tube stood.       He thinks that
this correction would be affected by the curvature of the meniscus
not being the same at high as at low temperatures.           The remark is
certainly true; but as the alteration in height due to altered curva
ture of meniscus would be well within the range of experimental
error, it is negligible.      The second criticism deals, with the capil
larity near the critical point, and van der Waals states that the
 simple formula, applicable to narrow tubes, no longer holds when
 the capillary rise is only a few times greater than the radius of the
 tube.    This objection would be justi<U+FB01>ed were it not that the
 capillary heights are nearly a linear function of the temperature;
 and with non-dissociating liquids, which he is here considering,

 it is quite unnecessary     to take measurements  at temperatures very
 close   to  the  critical temperature, because, if that temperature is
 known, there can be only one curve joining the points experiment
 ally found at somewhat lower temperatures and the critical tempera
 ture. The form of the curve is such that no doubt can exist as to its
 course.    Indeed, with chlorobenzene, measurements were not carried
out at all in the immediate neighbourhood of the critical point, but
 only at much lower temperatures, and yet there could be no question
 as to the course of the curve, when it was mapped.       But these are
 minor points; and it is very gratifying to <U+FB01>nd that the material
 provided by Dr. Shields and myself a<U+FB01>ords such a remarkable con
 <U+FB01>rmation of the justice of Professor van der Waals’ views.—18th May,

 III. “The       Molecular Surface—Energy       of Mixtures of non
       associating Liquids.”        By Professor WILLIAM RAMSAY,
       Ph.D., F.R.S., and Miss EMILY ASTON, B.Sc. Received
       April 26, 1894.
    It has been shown in the previous paper that it is possible to cal
culate the degree of association of an associating liquid such as
 alcohol, on the assumption that molecules of less complexity remain
 uniformly distributed along with molecules of greater complexity
 throughout the liquid, and that no one kind of molecule tends to
congregate on the surface to the exclusion of the other.     It is neces
 sary, however, to justify this assumption; and for this reason experi
 ments have been made on mixtures of liquids the molecules of which
 do not unite to form complex groups; such are most of the liquids
 investigated by Ramsay and Shields (‘Trana Chem. Soc.,’ vol. 63,
 p. 1099, et seq.).
    The experiments of which an account is here given, show that
while the height to which a mixture of two liquids ascends in a capil
lary tube is not the mean of the heights to which each singly would
ascend at the same temperature, while the surface-tensions and the
surface-energies are not necessarily the mean of those possessed by
the liquids unmixed with each other, regard being paid to their rela
tive proportion in the mixture, yet the coe<U+FB01>icient of decrease of mole
cular surface-energy, and consequently the calculated molecular
weights, are true means of those of the two liquids.
    The substances used in these experiments were chosen in pairs, and
as it was necessary in closing the tubes to evaporate some of the con
tained liquid in order to ensure the expulsion of air, mixtures of such
liquids were taken as possess approximately equal boiling points, so

reason the following liquids were chosen :—
         Toluene.   .   ..........        llO°'6 at 761'? mm. pressure.
         Piperidine      .........        105—106°'2 at 769 mm. pressure.
    *    Benzene        ..........        Constant, about 80°.

         Ethylene dibromide          .    Within   O'5°, about 131°.
         Carbon disulphide        . . .   Constant, about 462°.
         Chloroform          ........     Constant, about 62°.
   The amount of toluene distilled was 750 0.0. The thermometer did
not vary during the distillation by the <U+FB01>ftieth part of a degree.   The
amount of piperidine was much less, about 75 0.0. The alteration of
boiling point appears to be due, in part at least, to its eager absorp
tion of carbon dioxide. The benzene was part of a large stock which
had'been repeatedly frozen and thawed. It was free from thiophene,
and had an absolutely constant boiling point. The carbon tetra
chloride boiled constantly while 400 0.0. passed over. The chloroben
zene was part of a stock used for securing constant temperatures,
and had been repeatedly fractionated; it boiled with absolute con
stancy while 750 cc. passed over.    The ethylene dibromide was not
quite so pure; the rise of 05°, however, was spread over 200 0.0.;
while the purity of the carbon disulphide and the chloroform was
guaranteed by the constancy of boiling point while large quantities
distilled.
   The molecular surface-energies of the pure substances were <U+FB01>rst

   These results call for no special remark, except that, contrary to
the experiments of Ramsay and Shields, carbon disulphide appears
to associate somewhat at low temperatures. Further experiments will
be made on this matter at still lower temperatures. The result given
here may be taken as reliable, for it was carefully repeated several
times, special precautions being taken to ensure the absolute purity of
the bisulphidc, and using a di<U+FB01>ercnt capillary tube.
   The densities were taken from the following sources :—

   In <U+FB01>lling the tube with this mixture              0'113 gram was lost out of a
total of  41 grams,  or a little over 2 per cent. It may be assumed that,
owing to these liquids having so nearly the same boiling point, no
material alteration of their ratio is due to this cause.              The density of
the mixture was assumed to be the mean of those of the constituents,
taken in the proportion in which they were present. As will be after
wards shown, no appreciable error is involved in this assumption.

     The mean value of         K, calculated over the whole range of               tempera

     The mean value of k, calculated over the whole range of tempera
ture, is 2087 ; the mean value found is 2067. Here again the found
values of surface~tension and of surface-energy agree very closely with
those calculated.
    It is possible, without assuming a molecular weight, to calculate
the mean molecular weights of such mixtures by means of the equa

In   doing this, the mean value of k for each mixture has been taken,
and the value of M has been calculated between extreme limits of
temperature. For the <U+FB01>rst mixture the mean molecular weight found
is 90'61 ; that calculated for a mixture of <U+FB01>ve molecules of toluene to
one of piperidine is 9083 ; for the second mixture the mean molecular
weight found is 8612, and the calculated value for a mixture of <U+FB01>ve
molecules of piperidine to one of toluene is 8617.                      This, of course,
constitutes only an arithmetical check on the other results, but if a
mean value for It had been chosen, e.g., 2121, the results would have
been practically the same.
    It is obvious that in this case the liquids are without in<U+FB02>uence on
each other.

   Similar experiments were made with the above mixture ; the
densities of the mixture were determined experimentally, and a com
parison is given at each temperature of the numbers found, with the
mean density of the mixture, calculated from the found densities of
the components.    The loss of weight on sealing showed that 4'5 per
cent. of the mixture had evaporated; but here, too, the boiling points
of benzene and of carbon tetrachloride are so near that it is probable
that no important change in composition occurred.

   The calculated values of h are the means of the heights of benzene
and carbon tetrachloride at the respective temperatures.            It is to
be noticed that the observed heights are widely different.              But,
owing to the different densities of the two liquids, the calculated
values of *7, the surface-tensions, are nearly the means of those of each
taken singly; and the agreement of the found and calculated molecu
lar surface-energy, q(Mv)', is also a close one. The value of k
exaggerates the error of experiment, yet, on the whole, the agree
ment is satisfactory.        It would also appear that the operation of
mixing   does  not  affect the  density of either liquid appreciably.

1894.]      Molecular Surface-energy of Matures of Liquids.            191
    We see, from these experiments, that a mixture of two liquids
may either behave as a mean, or the liquids may in<U+FB02>uence each
other.      With the <U+FB01>rst two pairs, toluene and piperidine, and
benzene and carbon tetrachloride, the liquids belong to very different
chemical types.       With the second pair, the heights and densities
differ very greatly from each other, and although the values of
q and of 7(Mv)’ approach more nearly, there is still a marked differ
ence.      Yet the values of p, the density, q, the surface-tension,
and r/(ny, the molecular surface-energy of the mixtures, are iden
tical with those calculated, within limits of experimental error.
Perhaps this statement should, in strictness, not apply to the den~
sities, yet there is no great divergence from the mean.
    It is therefore legitimate to state that in certain cases the molecular
surface energy of a mixture is the mean of those of its constituents
determined at the same temperature.
    The third pair of liquids, chlorobenzene and ethylene dibromide,
give results belonging to a different category. Here the calculated
density is greater than that found.           This implies expansion on
mixing.      The values of 'y are also greater, and together with these
the values of 7(Mv)5.        But the rate of alteration of q(Mv)l with
temperature is practically normal, and the mean molecular weight
can therefore be calculated with fair approach to accuracy. The
fourth pair of liquids give still more abnormal results, owing probably
to the fact that one of them has some power of association.
    It would be premature to discuss these results without much more
 extended experimental evidence.         Experiments have already been
made with mixtures of alcohol and other liquids, and an investigation
of mixtures of acetic acid is still in progress. The problem is a
complex one; we have to deal with the extent to which the associa
 tion of an associated liquid is altered by dilution; and it will form
the subject of a further communication.        We have, however, thought
it advisable to bring forward some results in this paper to avoid the
possible generalisation from the behaviour of the <U+FB01>rst two pairs of
liquids that the molecular surface-energy of all liquids is the mean of‘
those which they possess when unmixed.
    One question remains to be considered ; it is this : Is it justi<U+FB01>able
to assume that the molecular surface-energy of a mixture of the
associated and dissociated molecules of a substance Whose molecular
complexity alters with temperature is the mean of each taken singly?
For, on that assumption, the mean molecular weights of associating
liquids have been calculated. In our opinion it is; but, as direct ex
perimental evidence is not as yet attainable, it may be well to bear in
mind that, although a fair working hypothesis, it cannot be taken as
a proved fact.

       Spectrum of      Metallic    Manganese,       of Alloys  of Manganese,
       and of Compounds containing that Element.”                    By W. N.
       HARTLEY, F.R.S. Received April 25, 1894.
                                     ( Abstract.)
    The spectrum of manganese has been the subject of much investi
gation; the spark spectrum was examined by Huggins, Thalén, and
Lecoq de Boisbaudran; the arc spectrum was studied by Angstrom,
Thalén, Cornu, Lockyer, also Liveing and Dewar; the <U+FB02>ame spectra
obtained from compounds of manganese were investigated by Simmler,
Von Lichtenfels, Lecoq de Boisbaudran, and Lockyer, while Marshall
Watts has given us accurate measurements of the wave-lengths of
lines and bands observed in the spark and oxyhydrogen <U+FB02>ame-spectra
of spiegel-eisen, manganese dioxide, and other compounds of this
metal.
    When investigating       the spectrum of the Bessemer <U+FB02>ame,        I found it
necessary    to compare the spectrum of elementary manganese under
 different conditions with that of its oxide when heated in the              oxy
hydrogen <U+FB02>ame.          Comparative experiments were made also               with
 various alloys,    as   spiegel-eisen,    silico-spiegel, ferromanganese,    tool
 steel, and malleable nickel which contains manganese; also                  with
compounds containing similar quantities of metal.
    Metallic manganese was prepared by the electrolysis of manganese
chloride, from which all other metals had been carefully separated.
 One preparation of pure manganese oxide was precipitated from a
 solution of potassium permanganate by the action of alcohol and a
 small quantity of sulphurous acid. Other specimens were precipitated
 from solutions of potassium permanganate by the addition of hydrogen
peroxide. By this treatment pure manganic oxide containing only
 traces of potash was obtained.          From one preparation even the potas.
 sium was removed.
    Photographs of the spectra of metallic manganese and of manganic
 oxide were taken and compared.             They were also compared with the
spectra   of  the alloys  of   manganese.        The periods of exposure varied
 from a mere <U+FB02>ash      in the   case  of  spiegel-eisen  when being poured into
a Bessemer converter, to 30 minutes             and even  as much as 80 minutes
 with manganic oxide.
    The leading features of the spectra of manganese and manganese
.Qxide are the same, but they differ in detail, as may be observed by
comparing the wave-lengths of the lines and bands in their respective
 spectra.

   It will    be readily understood that the bands can be measured with
far less accuracy than lines, and that they are subject to some degree
of variation in width, according to variation in the time of exposure
and the temperature.
   A striking group of lines, the most persistent in the whole of these
spectra, is situated in the violet.            The following measurements were
made     :—
                    4.0365         4,0349    Angstriim, also Cornu.

                    4029‘5         4029'41   Angstriim.
    Another line is just visible about 4031'8, but it is so close to 40320
that it could be discerned only when the extreme points of three very
strong lines were examined, and the plate was in perfect focus for
that region. The whole group of lines appears as two bands very
closely adjacent, or in the manganese oxide spectrum as one band
 with the centre appearing as if reversed, the less refrangible edge of
 the band being very strong and sharp, the more refrangible being
 degraded and diEuse. These lines remain after the bands in the
 yellow and green have disappeared from the photographs, but the
 result may be quite otherwise with eye observations, owing to the
 greater visibility of the yellow over the violet rays.
    Photographs of the spectra obtained with a dispersion of four

   Up  to  the  present time the precise nature of the spectrum, the
cause of its production, its sudden disappearance when decarburization
of the metal takes place, and the connexion between the decarburiza
tion of the metal and the extinction of the spectrum, have not been
satisfactorily explained. According to Roscoe, Liclegg, Kupelwieser,
and Spear Parker, the spectrum is characterised by bands of carbon
or of carbon monoxide, which disappear when all carbon is burnt out
of the metal.                                   .
   On the other hand, according to the investigations of Simmler<U+FB01>“
Brunner, Von Lichteni'els, and Wedding, the spectrum is not due to
carbon (Roscoe) or to carbon monoxide (Lielegg and Kupelwieser),
but to manganese and other elements in the pig-iron.
   The very careful examination of these spectra by Watts and his
comparison of them with that of the Bessemer <U+FB02>ame led to the con
clusion that it was not the spectrum of carbon in any form nor of
manganese, but that of manganic oxide.       Lielegg established the fact
that carbon monoxide yields a continuous spectrum, and that this gas
causes the continuous bright spectrum of the Bessemer <U+FB02>ame; but
he also attributed certain lines or bands to the high temperature of the
carbon monoxide. All observers are agreed as to the appearance after
a certain interval of the lines of the alkali metals which were origin
ally discovered by Roscoe to be present during the <U+FB01>rst period of the
“ blow.” Watts observed the C line of
                                         hydrogen during wet weather.
   This research was undertaken in 1882, and an instrument was
devised for the purpose of photographing the spectra of various
<U+FB02>ames emitted during metallurgical operations.        The work was left
in abeyance until certain practical dif<U+FB01>culties encountered in study
ing <U+FB02>ame spectra at high temperatures in the laboratory had been
overcome.     The original mounting of the instrument was too light,
but that which has recently been used with success is described.
   Owing to the courtesy of Mr. F. W. Webb, the engineer of the
Locomotive Department of the London and North .Western Railway,
and of Mr. E. P. Martin, the manager of the Dowlais Ironworks,
observations have been made at Crewe and at Dowlais during the past
year.   About ninety spectra were photographed, about <U+FB01>fty of which

taken at Crewe and Dowlais have been measured, and their wave

obtained are given. The description of each band and line measured
 is given, with its wave-length, its origin, and other references.            Photo

 were identi<U+FB01>ed with lines in the solar spectrum, with lines in Kayser
and Runge’s map of the arc spectrum of iron, and on spectra from

                        The Constitution   of the Bessemer Spectrum.
    The spectrum is a complex one which exhibits differences in con
stitution during di<U+FB01>erent periods of the “blow,” and even during
 di<U+FB01>erent intervals in the same period. As originally observed by
 Watts, the spectrum di<U+FB01>ers in different works, the difference being
due to temperature and to the composition of the metal bl'own.

     The cause of the Non-appearance        of Lines at the Commencement  and
                            Termination of the “Blow.”
     Some controversy followed         upon the publication of the papers by
Roscoe     and Lielegg.      Tunner stated that in Sweden the Bessemer
process was not facilitated by the use of the spectroscope.             Brunner
pointed out that the spectroscopic phenomena were not dependent on
the combustion of carbon, but were characteristic of the various
impurities in the metal. Wedding and Silliman discussed the origin
of the spectrum seen at di<U+FB01>erent periods of the “blow,” and failed to
account fully at that time for the non-appearance of lines at its com
mencement and termination.               Their views did not harmonise. Many
facts were discovered which were not understood, appeared contra-r
dictory, and required veri<U+FB01>cation.               These have all been carefully
examined and accounted for.
     Support is given to Wedding’s view, based on the analyses of
Brunner, that the non-appearance of the lines of manganese at the
commencement and termination of the blow is owing to the quantity
of metal volatilised at those periods being insuf<U+FB01>cient for the produc
tion of a spectrum.          At the commencement the temperature is too
low, being very      little  above    that of the molten metal; and, as free
 oxygen escapes along with carbon dioxide, the gaseous mixture con-7
tains too small a proportion of carbon monoxide. The alkalies which
 come from the ganister lining of the converter are present as silicates,
and in very small proportion; many silicates, such as, for instance,
 felspar, do not exhibit spectra of the alkalies they contain until
 heated in the oxyhydrogen <U+FB02>ame, but at this temperature the metals
 potassium, lithium, and rubidium have been detected with the
 greatest ease in such silicates. Similarly, the alkali metals do not
 show themselves in the Bessemer <U+FB02>ame until a layer of slag has been
 formed, and the temperature has risen su<U+FB02>iciently high for these
 basic constituents to be vaporised. At the temperature of the
  “ boil,” or second period, both metallic
                                                   manganese and iron are freely
  vaporised    in  a   current     of   carbon    monoxide,  which, in a highly
 heated    state, rushes   out   of the   bath  of molten metal. The evidence
  of this is the large number of bands of manganese and lines of iron
  in the spectrum.
      When the metal blown contains but little manganese, as, for
  instance, haematite pig, this is all converted into silicate during the
   <U+FB01>rst period.     The manganese spectrum in the <U+FB02>ame does not arise
   from that substance being contained in the bath of metal, it must be
   vaporised from the slag.         That this is so has been proved by photo
   graphs   of the spectrum     from   samples of slag obtained from the Crewe
   works.     There  is very   little  di<U+FB01>erence between these and the photo
   graphs of the <U+FB02>ame-spectrum taken at Crewe, during the “boil,” the

~diiference being chie<U+FB02>y in the iron line_ being stronger in the slag
spectrum.    This explains the fact observed by Brunner, namely,
that when a converter is being heated with coke after it has been
used, but not re-lined, the spectrum of the Bessemer <U+FB02>ame makes its
appearance ; manifestly it comes from the adhering slag.
   The luminosity of the <U+FB02>ame during the “ boil ” is due, not merely to
the combustion of highly heated carbonic oxide, but also to the pre
sence of the vapours of iron and manganese in the gas.
   The disappearance of the manganese spectrum at the end of the
“ <U+FB01>ning stage,” or third period, is primarily due to a reduction in the
quantity of heated carbon monoxide escaping from the converter,
which arises from the diminished quantity of carbon in the metal.
When the last traces of carbon are gone, so that air may escape
through the metal, the blast instantly oxidises any manganese, either
in the metal or in the atmosphere of the converter, and, furthermore,
oxidises some of the iron.      The temperature must then fall with
great rapidity.
   The entire spectroscopic phenomena of the “blow ” are undoubtedly
determined by the chemical composition of the molten iron, and of
the gases and metallic vapours within the converter, the temperature
of the metal and that of the issuing gases.
                 The Temperature  of the Bessemer Flame.
   The probable temperature of the Bessemer <U+FB02>ame at the <U+FB01>nish is
that produced by the combustion in cold air of carbonic oxide heated
to about 1580° C., that is to say, to the temperature which, according
to Le Chatelier (‘ Comptes Rendus,’ vol. 114, p. 670), is that of the
bath of molten metal from which the gas has proceeded.        The bath
of metal acts simultaneously as a means of heating the blast, producing
the gas, and as a furnace, on the regenerative principle, which heats
the gas prior to its combustion.      The heating e<U+FB01>ect is therefore
cumulative.     The temperature, as is well known, can easily rise too
rapidly, and the metal has then to be cooled by throwing cold pig
iron, or even old ingot moulds, into it.
   If we may judge by the lines and bands belonging to iron and
manganese which have been measured in photographed spectra of the
 Bessemer <U+FB02>ame, the temperature must nearly approach that of the
oxyhydrogen <U+FB02>ame, and may easily attain the melting point of plat
inum, namely, 1775° C. (Violle)..
   Marshal] Watts observed (‘ Phil. Mag,’ 1870) that the sodium
lines 5681 and 5687 may be employed as an index of temperature,
since they are present in the spectrum of any <U+FB02>ame containing sodium
which is hot enough to melt platinum, but do not appear at lower
 temperatures.    The Bessemer <U+FB02>ame does not show this double line,
 but only the D lines.

198                  Flame Spectra at         [Iz'gh   Temperatures.        [June [4,
    We cannot, however, conclude from this that the <U+FB02>ame is not
hot enough to produce these lines, for though the temperature may
be high enough the quantity of material present is not suf<U+FB01>cient to
cause their appearance.            Moreover, there are two intensely brilliant
bands of manganese closely adjacent, one of which certainly overlies
these lines.       Lastly, they are not to be seen in the photographed
spectrum obtained from slag heated in the oxyhydrogen <U+FB02>ame, which
melts platinum easily and slowly volatilises iridium wire.
    From thermo-chemical data the heat evolved during the “ blow "
has been calculated, but the speci<U+FB01>c heats of cast iron, slag, carbon
monoxide, and nitrogen are unknown at temperatures between
1200° C. and 2000" C.             If we allow for 50 per cent. of the heat
developed at high temperatures being lost by radiation or absorbed,
then the estimated temperature of the metal in the converter is more
than 1900" C.
    Le Chatelier (‘ Comptes Rendus,’ vol. 114:, p. 670) found the steel
in the ladle of a Robert converter to be at 1640° C. Reasons are
adduced for believing that it must certainly have been hotter than
this at the highest temperature of the “ blow.”
                    The Technical Aspect of this Investigation.
    The spectrum obtained from Bessemer-slag by the oxyhydrogen
<U+FB02>ame is composed of precisely the most characteristic features of the
<U+FB02>ame spectrum, as seen issuing from the converter at Crewe.                      Hence
at this temperature iron and manganese are freely volatilised, as
they are in the oxyhydrogen <U+FB02>ame.                      As a matter of course the
continuous spectrum of carbon monoxide, the bands and lines of that
 compound and of elementary carbon are absent from the slag
spectrum. The <U+FB02>ame spectrum at Dowlais di<U+FB01>ers from this, and
 resembles the spectrum of metallic manganese or more closely that
                                                       I
 of form-manganese. For reasons given, conclude that the spectrum
 at Orewe results from materials in the slag; but that at Dowlais from
 constituents vaporised from the bath of metal.
     The complete termination of the “ <U+FB01>ning stage " is clearly indicated,
 but there is no indication by the <U+FB02>ame of the composition of the
 metal within the converter at any previous stage. As the progress of
 the “ blow” is governed by the composition of the metal and its tem
 perature in the converter, and as these cannot be controlled with
                                           “ blow,” it follows that

                                 (Abstract.)
     The object of this investigation was to obtain a method for deter
mining thermal conductivities of metals, which would not require
 either elaborate preparations or large quantities of the substances to
 be tested, and by means of which a test could be made in a few
hours.
    The method about to be described was suggested by Lord Kelvin
thirty years ago, and is the experimental realisation of the theoretical
conditions implied in the fundamental formula
                               Q=kA3_,—”°t,
where the symbols have their usual meaning.
    The apparatus was made so as to be suitable to test the metals in
the form of wires of circular section.
    The diameters found most convenient were [from 2 to 4 mm., the
lengths from 4 to 8 cm.
    One end of a given length of the wire is kept at a constant known
temperature.     The rise of temperature of the other end of the wire
is noted every minute, and, if proper precautions be taken to prevent
loss by radiation from the sides, the data are obtained for calculating
the thermal conductivity.
    The wire to be tested is soldered at one end into the bottom of a
cOpper box, 16 cm. long, 6 cm. wide, and 7 cm. deep.        The bottom of
the box is made of copper 3 mm. thick, the sides of thin sheet copper.
    In the box, immediately above the hole into which the Wire is
soldered, there is a large block of copper, in which a hole has been
made suf<U+FB01>ciently large to admit a small thermometer.
    The box is <U+FB01>lled with water and supported at its middle by being
<U+FB01>tted into an asbestos-lined wooden screen, 24x24 cm. The water
is heated by a Bunsen burner placed on the other side of the screen

cated directly to the wire from the lamp. In the bottom of the box
above the lamp a number of thick copper pins is <U+FB01>xed, so as to catch
and distribute the heat.    3 mm. length of the other end of the wire
is soldered into a solid copper ball, diameter 5'5 cm.        In the ball a
hole 3 cm. deep is made, so as to admit the bulb and part of the stem
of a small and very sensitive thermometer. This thermometer is
graduated from 5° C. to 20° C., and can be easily read to within one
fortieth of one degree.   The bulb is surrounded by water.
   To prevent radiation from the surface of the wire, a tube of circular
section, diameter 1 cm., made of several layers of thin paper, sur—
rounds the wire all along its length. The air inside this tube soon
takes up the temperature of the part of the wire with which it is in
contact, and so practically eliminates radiation.
   A rough calculation gives for the maximum value of the loss due
to radiation, 55 per cent. when the surface of the wire is exposed to
the air, the length being 4 cm.       Unless the paper tube is e<U+FB01>ective,
the error due to radiation ought to be greater, the greater the length.
Exhaustive trials, however, proved that different lengths gave prac
tically the same value for the conductivity.
   The other possible errors, besides radiation, to be tested for are : —
   (1) The thermometer in the hot water may not indicate the tem
           perature of the end of the wire.
    (2) The solder may cause some error.
    (3) The thermometer in the ball may not indicate the average
           temperature.
    (4)  There  may be a lag in the thermometer.
    (5) The temperature of the ball may not be the same throughout,
           and the thermometer may not indicate the temperature '
                                                                          of
            the wire where it enters the ball.
    All these errors are practically tested by using di<U+FB01>erent lengths or
 diameters of the wire, and the results obtained in the present investi
 gation indicate that the errors have been eliminated.
    To test whether the thermometer in the hot water indicated the
temperature at the end of the wire, a thermo-electric junction, made
 of very thin platinoid and copper wires, was soldered to the wire just
 where it entered the box.    The other junction was tied to a thermo
 meter and immersed in water, which was heated till there was no
 de<U+FB02>ection in the sensitive mirror galvanometer which was used. The
temperature indicated by the thermometer was then found to be the
 same as that of the thermometer in the hot water.
   An approximate calculation for the other end of the wire shows
that the temperature of that end is somewhat lower than that of the
ball, the greatest difference being 1'5 per cent.     This difference was

     1894.]     Thermal Conductivity of illatals, with Applications.        201
     always allowed for by applying an approximate formula to each

     di<U+FB01>erent length.
        In order to make a complete test of a metal it is only necessary to
    take a wire of 5 or 6 cm. length and solder it <U+FB01>rmly, the one end into
     the bottom of the heating box, the other into the calorimeter ball.
     The water in the heating box is kept boiling briskly, and readings
    are taken every half minute from the thermometer in the ball.
     These readings are then put upon a curve as ordinates, with the
     time in minutes as abscissse. From this curve the rise of temperature
     per unit time can then be accurately read OE, and, the thermal
    capacity of the ball being already determined, the <U+FB02>ow of heat per
    unit time is obtained.                                _
        In order to eliminate radiation from the surface of the calorimeter
    ball, the latter is, at the beginning of the experiment, cooled to about
    6° or 7° C. below the temperature of the air, or rather of the water
    jacket which surrounds the ball.
        Let an be the quantity of heat that passes from the surface of the
    ball, when the latter is 9° above or below the temperature of the
    water-jacket ; Q1 the quantity of heat that <U+FB02>ows into the ball at the
    temperature 0° above that of the water-jacket; Q2 the quantity that
    <U+FB02>ows in when the ball is 6° below that of the jacket ; T the tempera
    ture of the hot end of the wire.
        Then if x is the mean conductivity,

                                  %(Q1+Q2) =          nor—a:
7     If, therefore, the rise in temperature per half minute at        6° above
    that of   the water-jacket    be taken from the curve and   added to the
    rise for 0° below the temperature of the jacket, the quantity %(Q1+Q2)
    is obtained, and is the <U+FB02>ow of heat when the temperatures of the ends
    of the wire are T° and       25°
                                 0., the radiation from the ball being thus
     eliminated.   If ten or <U+FB01>fteen of these values be taken from the curve
    and the mean found, a very accurate result         obtained. It
                                                              is        thus
                                                                       is
    immaterial whether the surface of the ball changes between each test,
    as long as it remains constant during the test.
        The metal which was chie<U+FB02>y used for the exhaustive tests of the
    method was copper wire, of diameter 0'21 cm., density 8'85, volume
    speci<U+FB01>c (electrical) resistance at about 13° C. 18341 in absolute units.
        The number obtained for the absolute value of the thermal conduc
    tivity was 0‘88838 C.G.S. units, which was the mean of the values for
    di<U+FB02>'erent lengths of from       to 41cm., the greatest variation being

   The greatest value obtained for copper was 0'9594 C.G.S. units,
which was for wire obtained from Messrs. Glover and Sons. The
speci<U+FB01>c (electrical) resistance was found to be 1730.
   It must be noted that these values are the means of the conduc
tivities corresponding to the temperatures at the ends of the wire.
When compared with the values obtained by other experimenters, the
results of the latter must be taken for the mean of 97° C. and _10° C.,
that is 53° C.
   For this temperature Angstrom gives 0'9208.
   Several qualities of copper were tested, as well as pure gold, silver,
and platinum, kindly lent for the investigation by Messrs. Johnson,
Matthey, and Co.

   While, however, these numbers agree very closely, other wires were
tested   in which the numbers varied considerably.
   It is intended to go on with tests of alloys, such as platinoid and
German silver; also, by using liquids other than water, to obtain
values of the variation of conductivity with temperature.

       Sir A. NOBLE, K.O.B., F.R.S., M.I.C.E., &c. Received June
       13, 1894.
    The researches on which I, in conjunction with Sir F. Abel, have
 been engaged for very many years, have had their scope so altered
 and extended by the rapid advances which have been made in the
 science of explosives, that we have been unable to lay before the
 Society the results of the many hundreds of experiments under
 varied conditions which      I  have carried out.       We are desirous also
 of clearing up    some   di<U+FB01>iculties   which    have     presented themselves
 with certain modern explosives when dealing with high densities
 and pressures, but the necessary investigations have occupied so

 much time that am induced to lay a few of our results before the
 Society, trusting, however, that before long we may be able to submit     '
 a more complete memoir.
    A portion of our researches includes investigations into the trans
 formation and ballistic properties of powders varying greatly in
 composition, but of which potassium nitrate is the chief constituent.
                             I
 In this preliminary note propose to refer to powders of this descrip
 tion chie<U+FB02>y for purposes of comparison, and shall devote my
 attention principally to gun-cotton and to those modern explosives
 of which gun-cotton forms a principal ingredient.
     In determining the transformation experienced during explosion,
 the same arrangements for <U+FB01>ring the explosive and collecting the
  gases were followed as are described in our earlier researches<U+FB01>“ and
  the gases themselves were, after being sealed, analysed either under
  the personal superintendence of Sir F. Abel, er of Professor Dewar,

   and to Professor        Dewar’s advice and assistance              I  am indebted,      I
   can   hardly  say to what extent.
       The heat developed by explosion, and the quantity of permanent
   gases generated were also determined as described in our researches,
    but the amount of water formed plays so important a part in the
   transformation that special means were adopted in order to obtain
   this product with exactness.
       The arrangement employed was as follows :—
       After explosion the gases formed were allowed to escape through
   two U-tubes <U+FB01>lled with pumice stone and concentrated sulphuric
   acid; when the gases had all escaped the explosion cylinder was
   opened, and the water deposited at the bottom'of the cylinder was
   collected in a sponge, placed in a closed glass vessel and weighed.
   The cylinder was then nearly closed and heated, and a measured
   quantity of air was, by means of an aspirator, drawn slowly through
   the U-tubes till the cylinder was perfectly                          This was easily
   ascertained by observing when moisture was no longer deposited
   on a cooled glass tube through which the air passed.
      The U-tubes were then carefully weighed, the amount of moisture
   absorbed determined, and added to the quantity of water directly
   collected. The aqueous vapour in the air employed for drying was,
   for each experiment, determined and deducted from the gross
   amount.
      Numerous experiments were made to ascertain the relation of the
   tension of the various explosives employed, to the gravimetric
   density of the charge when <U+FB01>red in a close vessel, but                   I  do not pro
   pose   here to   pursue   this   part  of  our   enquiry,   both    because     the sub
   ject is too large   to be    treated    of  in a  preliminary note and because
   approximate values have already been published" for several of the
   explosives with which we have experimented.
      With certain explosives, the possibility or probability of detona
   tion was very carefully investigated.              In some cases the explosive
  was merely placed        in   the   explosion vessel in close proximity to a
   charge of mercuric fulminate by which it was <U+FB01>red, but                    I found that
  the most satisfactory method of experiment was to place the charge
  to be experimented with in a small shell packed as tightly as possible,
'
  the shell then being placed in a large explosion vessel and <U+FB01>red by
  means of mercuric fulminate.              The tension in the small shell at the
  moment of fracture and the tension in the large explosion vessel were
  in each experiment, carefully measured.
      It may be desirable here to explain that               I  do not consider the
  presence    of  a  high pressure     with   any explosive as necessarily denot
  ing detonation. With both cordite and gun-cotton                   I  have developed
  enormous pressures,         close upon 100 tons per square inch (about
     * Noble, ‘Internal Ballistics,’ 1892, p. 33;  ‘
                                                     Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol'. 52, p. 128.

 15,000 atmospheres), but the former explosive       I have not succeeded
in detonating, while gun-cotton can be detonated with the utmost
ease.    It is obvious that if we suppose a small charge <U+FB01>red in a
vessel impervious to heat, the rapidity or slowness of combustion will
make no di<U+FB01>erence in the developed pressure, and that pressure will
be the highest of which the explosive is capable, regard being of
course had to the density of the charge.        I say a small charge, be
cause, if a large charge were in question and explosion took place
with extreme rapidity, the nascent gases may give rise to such
whirlwinds of pressure, if     I may use the term, that any means we
may have of registering the tension will show pressures very much
higher than would be registered were the gases, at the same temper
ature, in a state of quiescence.     I  have had innumerable proofs of
this action, but it is evident that in a very small charge the nascent
gases will have much less energy than in the case of a large charge
occupying a considerable space.
    The great increase in the magnitude of the charges <U+FB01>red from
modern guns has rendered the question of erosion one of great im
portance.     Few, who have not had actual experience, have any idea
how rapidly with very large charges the surface of the bore is re
moved. Great attention has therefore been paid to this point, both
in regard to the erosive power of diiierent explosives and in regard
to the capacity of different materials (chie<U+FB02>y different natures of
steel) to resist the erosive action.
    The method    I  adopted for this purpose consisted in allowing large
charges to escape through a small vent. The amount of the metal
 removed by the passage of the products of explosion, which amount
 was determined by calibration, was taken as a measure of the erosive
 power of the explosive.
    Experiments have also been made to determine the rate at which
 the products of explosion part with their heat to the surrounding
 envelope, the products of explosion being altogether con<U+FB01>ned.           I
 shall only brie<U+FB02>y allude to these experiments, as, although highly
 interesting, they have not been carried far enough to entitle me to
 speak with con<U+FB01>dence as to <U+FB01>nal conclusions.
    Turning now to ballistic results. The energies which the new ex
 plosives are capable of developing, and the high pressures at which
 the resulting gases are discharged from the muzzle of the gun, render
 length of bore of increased importance.       With the object of ascer
 taining with more precision the advantages to be gained by length,
 the <U+FB01>rm to which     I belong has experimented with a 6-inch gun of
 100 calibres   in  length.   In the particular experiments to which     I
 refer, the velocity and energy generated has not only been measured
 at the muzzle, but the velocity and the pressure producing this
 velocity have been obtained for every point of the bore, consequently

the loss of velocity and energy due to any particular shortening of
the bore can be at once deduced.
   These results have been obtained by measuring the velocities every
round at sixteen points in the bore and at the muzzle. These data
enable a velocity curve to be laid down, while from this curve the
corresponding pressure curve can be calculated.            The maximum
chamber pressure obtained by these means is corroborated by simul
taneous observations taken with crusher gauges, and the internal
 ballistics of various explosives have thus been completely de.
termined.
   Commencing with gun-cotton, with which a very large number of
analyses were made, with the view of determining whether there was
any material difference in the decomposition dependent upon the
pressure under which it was exploded, two descriptions were em
ployed : one in the form of bank or strand, and the other in the form
of compressed pellets. Both natures were approximately of the same
composition, of Waltham Abbey manufacture, containing in a dried
sample about 4‘4 per cent. of soluble cotton and 956 per cent. of
insoluble. As used, it contained about 2'25 per cent. of moisture.
   The following were the results of the analyses of the permanent
gases.      They are placed in <U+FB01>ve series, viz. :—
   First. Analyses showing the decomposition of the strand or hank
 gun-cotton.     Second. Analyses showing the decomposition of pellet
gun-cotton.
   In both these      series the analyses are arranged in the order of the
ascending pressures under which the decomposition took place.
   Third and fourth. Examples of the decomposition of strand and
pellet gun-cotton when exploded by means of mercuric fnlminate;
and, <U+FB01>fth, a series showing the decomposition experienced by pellet
gun-cotton saturated with from 25 to 30 per cent. of water, and deto
nated by means of a primer of dry gun-cotton and mercuric fulminate.
   I  leave these results for discussion in the memoir which Sir F. Abel
and    I  hope before long to submit, and will only remark that, in
Tables    I  and II, the same peculiarity we have before remarked upon
in reference to gunpowder, is again exhibited;        I mean the marked
manner in which the carbonic anhydride increases with the pressure.
It will be noted that in Table I the volumes of carbonic anhydride
and carbonic oxide are nearly exactly reversed; again, considering
that the composition of the pellet and strand gun-cotton is practically
the same, the distinct di<U+FB01>erence between the proportions of these pro
ducts in the two series is su<U+FB02>iciently remarkable.      It not improbably
is connected with the rapidity of combustion of the two samples.
Another striking peculiarity is the manner in which the C02 is in
creased (as exhibited in Table V) when saturated pellet cotton is
detonated.

   Such are the average analyses of the permanent gases generated
by the decomposition of gun-cotton under the various conditions                               I
have described, and it will be evident from these analyses that the
volumes of the permanent gases may be expected to differ to some
very appreciable extent, depending both upon the density under
which it is exploded, and also upon the mode of explosion.                            I have
found it most convenient to explode the charges, the permanent gases
from which were to be measured, under a pressure of about 10 tons
per square inch (1,524 atmospheres), and, under these circumstances,
the average of several very accordant determinations gave, at 0° C.
and 760 mm. of mercury, 689 0.0. per gram of strand gun-cotton and
725 0.0. per gram of pellet gun-cotton.
   "' The pressures given are those due to the gravimetric          density of the charge.

    At the temperature of explosion the whole of        the water formed is
in the  gaseous state.    It is therefore necessary, in order to obtain the
total gaseous volume, to add to the above volumes of permanent gases
the equivalent volume of aqueous vapour at the temperature and
pressure stated.     Now the quantity of water formed by the explosion
of 1296 grams of gun-cotton was found to be 16‘985 grams; hence
 1 gram of gun-cotton generated 0'1311        gram of water, equivalent to
1626 0.0. of aqueous vapour, and the total volume of gaseous matter
at the temperature and pressure stated is for strand gun-cotton
8522 0.0. per gram, for pellet 8876 0.0.
    The heat measured reached, with strand gun-cotton, 1068 gram
units water <U+FB02>uid, or 988 gram-units water gaseous, while with
pellet gun-cotton these <U+FB01>gures were 1037 or 957 gram-units respec
              ‘                                                             ‘

    Pellet gim-cotton made at Stowmarket generated 738 0.0. of
permanent gas and 994 units of heat per gram, while dinitro-cellulose
containing 128 per cent. of nitrogen generated 748 0.0. of gas and
977 units of heat, the water in both cases being <U+FB02>uid.
    Gun-cotton, both pellet and strand,     I  have detonated by means of
mercuric fulminate with ease and certainty.         The e<U+FB01>ect of employing
this means of ignition in a close vessel is very striking, and the
indications of intense heat are much more' apparent than when the
charge is <U+FB01>red in the ordinary way. This effect is probably partly
due to an actual higher temperature, caused by the greater rapidity
of combustion. 1 allude elsewhere to the extreme rapidity with
which the gases part with their heat, but this higher heat is, think,I
clearly indicated by the surfaces of the internal crusher gauges
becoming covered with innumerable small cracks and by thin laminae
occasionally <U+FB02>aking o<U+FB02>' exposed surfaces; but perhaps the most
striking proof of the violence of this detonation is shown by its action
on a cast-iron shell <U+FB01>red as       I have described; where no detonation
takes place the shell is broken into fragments of various sizes, such
as are familiar to all acquainted with the bursting of shell; but when
detonation, with gun-cotton, for example, takes place, the whole
shell is reduced to very minute fragments, and, what is more remark
able, two-thirds of the total weight are generally in the form of
small peas and of the <U+FB01>nest dust.
  - The ease with which gun-cotton can be detonated renders it unsuit
able for use as a propulsive agent unless this property be in some way
neutralised.      I have, therefore, made but few experiments in this
direction, and shall not further allude to them in this note, as more
suitable explosives, explosives also of which gun-cotton is a principal
component, have been elaborated, and these not only possess to the
full the high ballistic properties of gun-cotton, but are more or less
free from the tendency to detonate, which, however useful it may be
                                                                 r   2

in other directions, is   a fatal objection to the employment of gun
cotton  for  propelling purposes.
    Turning now to cordite; cordite consists, as is well known, of
nitro-glycerine and gun-cotton as its main ingredients.           As now
made it contains 37 per cent. of gun-cotton (trinitro-cellnlose with a
small proportion of soluble gun-cotton), 58 per cent. of nitro-glycerine,
and 5 per cent. of a hydrocarbon known as vaselin. On account of
the importance of this explosive, I have made numerous experiments,
both with large and small charges, to determine the relation of the
tension to the density of the charge. Up to densities of 055 the
relation may be considered to be very approximately determined;
above that density, although many determinations have been made,
 these determinations have shown such wide variations           that they
cannot, until certain discrepancies are explained, he assumed as at all
accurate.
    The average results of some of the analyses of the permanent gases
 are given below :—
    The <U+FB01>rst four analyses were made from experiments with the
 earlier samples of cordite when tannin formed an ingredient of
 cordite.    They are not, therefore, strictly comparable with the later
 analyses.    There appears also to be a di<U+FB01>erence in the transformation,
 slight but decided, which the same cordite experiences, dependent
 upon the diameter of the cord, and this difference is shown at once in
  the analyses, in the volume of permanent gases, in the heat developed,
 and,  I think, in the amount of aqueous vapour formed.
     The following are some of the analyses :—-

    In the whole of these analyses the water formed by the explosion
 smelt strongly of ammonia.
    The quantity of permanent gases measured, under the same con
 ditions as in the case of gun-cotton, was found to be—
   For the earlier cordite, 655 vols.
   For the present service cordite, 0255 in. in diameterh692 vols.,
 and for that 0048 in. in diameter, 698 vols. .In the two latter
 samples the aqueous vapour was determined, and was found to

amount    to 20257 grams for the O'255-in.     cordite, and to 20126 grams
for the    0‘048—in. cordite;    or, stating the result per gram, these
<U+FB01>gures    are respectively equivalent to 0'1563          gram, or 194 c.c.
aqueous   vapour, and to 01553 gram, or 192'5 c.c. per gram of cordite.
   Hence the total gaseous products generated by the explosion of
cordite amount per gram to 886 c.c. for the O'255-in. cordite, and to
8905 c.c. for the O'O48-in. cordite, the volumes being, of course, taken
at 0° C. and 760 mm. atmospheric pressure.
   The heat generated was found to be :—For the earlier cordite,
1214 gram-units water <U+FB02>uid; for the service O'255-in. cordite, 1284
gram—units water <U+FB02>uid or 1189 units water gaseous; for the service
O'O48-in. cordite, 1272 units water <U+FB02>uid or 1178 units water gaseous.‘
   From my very numerous experiments on erosion           I  have arrived at
the conclusion that the principal factors determining its amount are :
(1) the actual temperature of the products of combustion, (2) the
motion of these products. But little erosive e<U+FB01>ect is produced, even
by the most erosive powders, in close vessels, or in those portions of
the chambers of guns where the motion of the gas is feeble or m'l;
but the case is widely different where there is rapid motion of the
gases at high densities.    It is not ditlicnlt absolutely to retain without
leakage the products of explosions at very high pressures, but if there
be any appreciable escape before the gases are cooled they instantly
cut a way for themselves with astonishing rapidity, totally destroying
the surfaces over or through which they pass. Among all the ex
plosives with which     I  have experimented      I have found that where
the heat developed is low the erosive effect is also low.
   With ordinary powders, the most erosive with which               I am ac
 quainted   is that which, on  account   of other properties, is used for the
battering charges of heavy guns :       I refer to brown prismatic powder.
The erosive effect of cordite, if considered in relation to the energy
generated by the two explosives, is very slightly greater than that of
brown prismatic, but. very much higher effects can, if it be so desired,
be obtained with cordite, and, if the highest energy be demanded, the
erosion will be proportionally greater.      There is, however, one curious
and satisfactory peculiarity connected 'with erosion by cordite.
 Erosion produced by ordinary gunpowder has the most singular eifect
 on the metal of the gun, eating out large holes and forming long
rough grooves, resembling a ploughed <U+FB01>eld in miniature, and these
grooves have, moreover, the unpleasant habit of being very apt to
 develop into cracks; but with cordite, so far as my experience goes,
 the erosion is of a. very different character. The eddy holes and long
 grooves are absent, and the erosion appears to consist in a simple
 washing away of the surface of the steel barrel.
    Cordite does not detonate; at least, although      I have made far more
 experiments on detonation with this explosive than with any other,

I  have never succeeded in detonating it. With an explosive like
cordite, capable of developing enormous pressures, it is, of course,
easy, if the cordite be <U+FB01>nely comminuted, to develop very high
tensions, but, as I have already explained, a high pressure does not
necessarily imply detonation.
   The rapidity with which cordite gases lose their temperature, and
consequently their pressure, by communication of their heat to their
surrounding envelope is very striking.           Exploding a charge of about
 1% lbs. of cordite  in  a close vessel   at a tension  of a little over 6 tons
on the square inch, or say 1000 atmospheres,            I  have found that the
pressure of 6 tons per square inch was again reached in 0'07 see.
after explosion, of 5 tons in 0171 sec., of 4 tons in 0731 sec., of
3 tons in 1'764 secs., of 2 tons in 3'523 secs., and of 1 ton in 708 secs.
The loss of pressure after 1 ten per square inch was reached was, of
course, slow, but the <U+FB01>gures I have given were closely approximated
to in two subsequent experiments. With ordinary gunpowder the
reduction of pressure was very much slower, as was to be expected,
on account of the charge being much larger; on account, also, of the
temperature of explosion being much lower.
   These experiments are now being continued with larger charges
and higher pressures.
   It only remains to give particulars as to ballistics, that is as to the
velocities and energies realisable by cordite in the bore of a gun, but
these will be most conveniently given with similar details regarding
other explosives with which I have experimented.
   The ballistite   I   have used has, like the cordite, been changed in
composition since the commencement               of my experiments.          The
sample    I  used  for   my   earlier  experiments was nearly exactly com
posed of 50 per cent. of dinitro-cellulose (collodion cotton) and 50
per cent. of nitro-glycerine.        The cubes were coated with graphite,
and the nitro-cellulose was wholly soluble in ether alcohol.
   The second sample was nominally composed of 60 per cent. of
nitro-cellulose and 40 per cent. of nitro-glycerine.              The proximate
                                                                                 '

   The earlier sample gave the following permanent gases under pres

   One gram of this ballistite           gives rise to 610 c.c. of permanent
                                                                                     ‘
gases, and to 0'1588 gram of aqueous vapour corresponding to 197 c.c.
at 0° C and 760 mm.
   Hence the total volume of gas is 807 0.0., and the heat generated
by  the explosion is 1,365 gram-units (water <U+FB02>uid), 1,269 gram-units
(water gaseous).
   Although I have not made nearly so many experiments on detona
tion with ballistite as with cordite, those              I  have made with the
earlier samples (50 per cent. gun-cotton and 50 per cent. nitro
glycerine) neither detonated, nor did they show any tendency to
detonate, but the case is different with respect to a sample of ballis
titeconsisting of 60 per cent. gun-cotton and 40 per cent. nitro
glycerine.    This sample, O'2-in. cubes, detonated with great violence
on two occasions, but      I am unable, without further experience, to say
whether this result was due to the change in the composition of the
ballistite or to defective manufacture.
   The erosive action of ballistite is, as might perhaps be anticipated
from the higher heat developed, greater than with cordite, but the
remarks made with respect to the action of cordite apply also to
ballistite.
   The French B.N. powder consists of nitro-cellulose partially
gelatinised and mixed with tannin, with barium and potassium
nitrates.                                                                          .

   These permanent gases occupied at the usual temperature and pres

addition 206 c.c., so that the total gaseous volume was 822 c.c.
   The heat generated was 1,003 gram-units (water <U+FB02>uid) or 902
gram-units (water gaseous) ; the ballistics obtained with this powder
are given along with those furnished by other explosives.
   For purposes of comparison         I   have introduced among the ballistic
results those obtained with amide prismatic powder, and with R.L.G.

need not here be repeated.

of comparing the velocities and     energies developed by the new explo
sives is by   the aid of diagrams.
    Accordingly, in Fig. l, I show the velocities of seven di<U+FB01>erent
explosives from the commencement           of motion to the muzzle of the
gun; the position of the points at which the velocity is determined
are shown, and on the lowest and highest curves the observed
velocities are marked where it is possible to do so without confusing
the diagram. Lines are drawn to indicate the velocities that are
obtained with the lengths of 40, 50, 75, and 100 calibres.
    Fig. 2 shows the pressures by which the velocities of Fig. l
were obtained.       The areas of these curves represent the energies
realised, and the lines intersecting the curves indicate the pressures
at which the gases are discharged from the muzzle for lengths of
40, 50, 75, and 100 calibres respectively.             The chamber pressures
indicated by crusher gauges are also shown in Fig. 2, and it will
be observed that the two modes of determining the maximum pres
sure are in general in close accordance.
    It will further be observed that with the slow-burning powders
the chronoscopic maximum pressures are somewhat, though not
greatly higher, than are those indicated by the crusher gauges.
This observation is not new<U+FB01>‘ It was noted in the long series of
experiments with black powders carried on by the Committee of
Explosives.
    The result is widely di<U+FB01>erent where an explosive powder or a
quickly-burning powder, such as R.L.G., giving rise to wave-pressure
is employed; the crusher gauge in such cases+ gives considerably
and frequently very greatly higher pressures, and this peculiarity is
illustrated in the curve from R.L.G-. in Fig. 2.
    It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to point out that the results given
in Fig. 1 have to be considered in relation to the facts disclosed in
Fig. 2.      Thus it will be noted that the velocities and energies
realised by 22 lb. of 0‘35-in. cordite and 20 lb. of 0'3-in. cordite are
practically the same, but reference to Fig. 2 shows that with the
O'3-in. cordite this velocity and energy has been obtained at the cost
of nearly 30 per cent. higher maximum pressure.
    A similar remark may be made in regard to the French B.N.
powder if compared with the ballistite.           Its velocity and energy are
obtained at a high cost of maximum pressure, and it is interesting
to note how the velocity curve of B.N., which for the <U+FB01>rst four
feet of motion shows a velocity higher than that of any other ex
 plosive, successively crosses other curves, and gives at the muzzle a
 velocity of 500 f.s. under that of cordite.

Figs. 1 and 2 are summarised in the annexed table, which shows for
each nature of explosive the advantage in velocity and energy to be
gained by correspondingly lengthening the gun.
    Fig. 3 is an interesting illustration of a point to which     I have
elsewhere adverted. Cordite and ballistite leave no deposit in the
bore.    Round 1 with R.L.G. was <U+FB01>red with a clean bore. The differ
ence in velocity between round 1 with a clean bore and rounds 2 and
3 with powder deposit in the chase is very clearly marked, and it
will be noted that in this instance the effect of the foul bore is only
distinctly shown when the length exceeds 4.0 calibres.
    From 40 calibres onwards the loss of velocity due to a bore
encrusted with deposit is very distinctly shown.

    No de<U+FB01>nite measurements, as far as     I  am aware, have been made
of the change in colour produced by contrast, except in a small work
of my own in which results were given in terms of colour mixtures,
 and earlier by a brief reference in a work by Rood, in which the
change produced was endeavoured to be matched by means of
 rotating disks.              ‘
    The method of registering any colour in terms of some de<U+FB01>nite
 wave-length of light, together with white light (see ‘Proceedings
 Royal Society,’ vol. 49) renders the registration of any colour
 readily e<U+FB02>c‘ected, and by applying it to the contrast colours, very fair
 results have been obtained, which cannot be very far from the truth.
 It is usually stated that the contrast colour produced on a white
 surface by an adjacent colour is the complementary colour, of course
 largely diluted with white light.    I should like to point out that in
 the <U+FB01>rst place we have to know what a complementary colour is,
 and in the second what the added white light may be. As a matter
 of fact the kind of white light employed has to be de<U+FB01>ned before it can
 be stated what the complementary to any colour may be. If, for instance,
 we wish to de<U+FB01>ne what the complementary of orange may bc, we must
 know what is the nature of the white light before we can give the com
 plementary. Suppose we take the white of daylight, or of the electric
 light, we know that to make a white of this character we must add a
 certain quantity of blue of a certain wave length to the orange. When
 it is produced under these circumstances, the blue is the comple
 mentary to the orange. Suppose, however, we wish to know the
 complementary to the orange, in what is called the White light of the
 amyl acetate lamp, or of a candle, we are at once met by a di<U+FB02>iculty.

The colour of the light of these two sources, can, as far as the eye can
distinguish, be very closely matched—if not exactly—by an orange
ray in the spectrum. Evidently then in such a case there can be no
complementary to this ray. We know as a matter of observation
that these lights do contain a certain quantity of rays of the higher
refrangibility, but so small proportionally to that found in daylight
that it is negligible.   Again, we may take a light, such as the oxy
hydrogen light, and may match its whiteness by placing in the
electric light spectrum three slits, one in the red, another in the
green, and another in the blue, mixing the three rays, and altering
the apertures of the slits as required.     The complementary of the red
for the oxyhydrogen       white  light will  be obtained by shutting off
the red ray, leaving the mixture of the green and blue rays.             Keep
ing the slits in the same position in the spectrum, a match may next
be made with the white light of the electric (are) light. The comple
mentary of the red may again be found as before, when it will be
found that the mixture of green and blue forming it will be bluer
than in the case of the oxyhydrogen light.
    From the above it will be seen that no complementary colours can
be de<U+FB01>nitely stated unless the quality of the white light be known.
 Sunlight and daylight being always yellower, at sea level, the lower
 the altitude of the sun, it follows that any attempt to <U+FB01>x accurately
 the wave-length of the complementary for daylight to any ray of the
spectrum must be exceedingly dif<U+FB01>cult.           Wave-lengths of comple
mentaries are given, however, in various text-books, but without any
 statement as to the quality of the white light to which they refer. It
follows that if we do know the complementary colour, then the white
light which has to be added to it in order to match the contrast colour
must- refer to the same white to which the complementary is referred.
    In the experiments which were undertaken as to the true colour
 produced by contrast the light employed was that which                I  have
 always used in colour experiments, viz., that emitted by the crater
 on the positive pole of the electric light—a light which is unchange
able, and which can be relied upon as always being of the same
 quality, the relative luminosities of the different parts of its spectrum
being <U+FB01>xed. Two complete sets of apparatus for producing colour

 the spectrum and forming a patch on the cube, and the white being

  cube, one    illuminated   by pure    white light and  the other by the
  spectrum colour.       These were separated from one another by an
  interval illuminated by a mixture of the spectral colour and white
  light, and on each side of the shadows the same diluted colour was to
  be found.     The appearance of the side of the cube was as below.

  the surface was 0'5 of an amyl acetate lamp at 1 foot, the intensity of
  the other colours can be obtained from the luminosity curve in the
  ‘
    Phil. Traus.,’ “ Colour Photometry,” Part III, 1892.
    _
      The patch of colour from instrument No.         I was thrown on the
  face of a cube (N 0. II) 1 foot away from the <U+FB01>rst cube, and was used
  to match the contrast colour produced on A, <U+FB01>g 1. The beam of white
  light also fell on the same face of the cube, and the intensities of each
  could be altered at will, that of the colour by opening or closing the slit
  through which the colour came, and that of the white light by rotat
  ing sectors.     By this means any dilution of colour could be secured.
  It may be mentioned that the e<U+FB02>'ect of using a strip of the face of the
  cube equal in width to the width of A was tried, but no advantage
  was found by so doing. The method of procedure was as follows:
      Wit-h instrument No.   II  the colour to be used and the white beam
  were thrown on the face of the cube No. II. The luminosities of
  the two were made as nearly equal as possible. With instrument N o.       I
  a. colour, which it was judged was nearly the dominant colour of the
  contrast colour on A, was thrown on the face of the cube N 0.             I
  and white light added.       When it was found that a match was per
  fected by slight changes in the colour and in the intensity of the
  added white, the scale No. of the 0010111' was read, from which the
  wave-length would be determined, and the relative luminosities of
  the white and the colour measured directly. The aperture of the slit

  used in making the match being known the dilution of the colour
  would be determined readily.
     It was found that a slight change in the contrast took place after
  repeatedly shifting the eyes from the one cube to the other.      For in
  stance, the contrast caused by green appeared to lose a little of its
  red hue, degenerating into a brown-yellow.      To avoid this, an arti<U+FB01>ce
  was employed, which appears to be completely successful.        An ordi
  nary box stereoscope, with the lenses removed, was mounted on a
  stand, and in such a position that when the left eye only saw cube
  No. II, the right eye saw but No. I cube.     Thus, the right eye never
  saw the contrast colour, whilst the left never saw the match.           In
  this way, by alternately changing the direction of the eyes to the two
  cubes, a match could be readily made.        When the match was con
  sidered satisfactory, the eyes were directed to a moderately weak
  white light, and, after a short interval of time, turned to the two
  cubes, when, if the contrast colour on the one cube and the mixed
  colours on the other appeared to match accurately, the necessary
  readings were taken.

     Subsequently it was found more convenient to move the rod
  placed in the paths of the two beams of the instrument No.          II,  so
  that only one shadow appeared, as in <U+FB01>g. 2. In <U+FB01>g. 2 the stripe of
  white light, A, is shown. It is obvious that the stripe of colour
  could be equally well isolated. There is no difference in the contrast
  colours created in the white by this plan, so that only one table of
  results need be given.
     It will be seen from the table that different and representative
  parts of the spectrum were used, being the red, yellow, green, blue,
  and violet, and that in every case the contrast colours provoked
  in the white could be matched by a single colour of de<U+FB01>nite wave
  length when diluted by white light. If the contrast colour caused
  by the green were its complementary diluted by white light, it
  should be by a purple, which requires a mixture of red and blue,
  whereas it is an orange.    The fact as to whether the contrast colour

 as matched could ever make white when mixed                with the colour which
 caused   it was very readily proved.         The two colours were thrown on
 the same cube, and the proportions           of the colours altered. In some
few cases there was a very close approximation to the formation of a
white which matched the electric light, but in the majority no match
could be made.
    Another set of experiments further exempli<U+FB01>ed this. In instru
ment No. 11 three colours were chosen—one in the red, another in
the green, and the third in the violet. The same three colours were
found in instrument No. I, and three adjustable ones placed in them.
With these three slits a match was made with the white of the
electric light in the <U+FB01>rst instance—a contrast between white and the
red was then formed on the cube, illuminated by No. 11 instrument.
The red was then shut 011 from instrument No.1, and the mixed
violet and green lights were diluted with white light, but in no state
of dilution did the white stripe as coloured by contrast appear of the
same tint as the complementary colour of the red as obtained from
the diluted mixture. The same negative results were obtained by
making the contrast with the green. With the violet a much nearer
approach was made.
    This experiment was varied by matching the light from an
Argand gas burner, and by forming the contrasts by means of the
same quality of light. The same negative results were again obtained.
    The di<U+FB01>erence, if any, was next observed between a contrast made
by a saturated colour and that given by the diluted colour.

   In order       to get a stripe of white inclosed between two saturated
stripes   of   colour     a Vernon Harcourt screen was employed instead
of a rod.       The principle of this may not be known generally, so a
brief description of it may be necessary.                    It consists of a rectan
gular metallic sheet of about two inches wide, in which two broad
slits are cut and separated from each other by the width of the slits.
This sheet, if placed in the path of the beam allows two stripes of
colour and of white to pass.                By carefully adjusting the position of
this screen a stripe of white may be enclosed between two stripes
of colour. The results are given in Table II.

 1894.]      Measurement    of Colour produced  by Contrast.        227
    There are such small differences in the wave-lengths of the con
 trasts produced by the diluted and saturated colours that it may be
presumed they are due to error of observation, although each table
is derived from the mean of several observations extending over a
period of three years.     It may be interesting to state that in every
case the extremes in the one series embraced the mean value tabulated
in the other series, and that in no case did the mean di<U+FB01>er from any
single observation more than X 2'5.
                                                                        '
    There is, however, a very simple means of noting the accord-
ance between the contrasts caused by the diluted and saturated
colours.    With one instrument the contrast caused by the saturated
colour was shown on one surface, and with the other that by the
same colour, but diluted, on another surface, so that the two could be
directly compared.    To the eye the only difference between the two
was in the amount of dilution of the colour produced by contrast;
otherwise they appeared absolutely identical.
    An endeavour was made to ascertain at the same time what dark
interval between the white and the colours would prevent the con
trast being appreciable. To do this a cube with a whitened surface
was placed as shown on the top of another white surface with a black
interval between the two (<U+FB01>g.
                                  FIG. 3.
    The colour patch was thrown so as to fall only on the cube 0,
whilst  the white beam illuminated the white surface a as well. When
the white beam was also thrown on another cube a foot away it was
practicable to form an idea of the colour of “a.”       The effect was
curious and interesting.     When the black band I) was just 3} inch in
depth, whilst the white stripe A appeared strongly coloured, a,
appeared very nearly white, and if by an arti<U+FB01>ce saturated colour
surrounded A it was pure white. If black intervals were placed on
each side of A the colour in A did not disappear, but appeared to be
more diluted, probably owing to contrast in the white caused by
black, but the colour still remained. If, however, a black interval
was on one side of A (that is by placing the shadow against the edge

A), when the colour was saturated white appeared perfectly white,
whilst if dilute just a shade of contrast colour was visible.
   By placing a diluted coloured space in contact with a pure white
space which was in its turn in contact with a saturated colour,
it became possible with several colours to make the diluted colour
appear white in contrast to the contrast colour itself. With red
this became impracticable, and for a reason which will be apparent
in a paper which I propose shortly to communicate.
   In this paper it is not intended to include the changes made in
undiluted colours by contrast with white or other undiluted colours,
or between colour mixtures.          It may, however, be said that except
for the red and the violet there is a tendency for the two colours to
become more widely separated in the spectrum.          Thus with red and
yellow   the   red  remains  of  the  same hue, butvappears slightly more
saturated, whilst the yellow appears greener.       This would necessarily
follow from the contrast colours produced on a white stripe by satu
rated colours.
   The reasoning given to explain contrast colours on the Young
 theory, or on that of Hering seems insuf<U+FB01>cient, and very hypothetical.
I  would-however, (all attention to a curious phenomenon which
 General Festing and myself described incidentally in “ Colour Photo
metry, Part III.”         When getting the <U+FB01>nal extraction of colour
from   a  red   ray by a  direct  comparison with very faint white it was
found that when apparently both appeared of the same grey 11110,
if the white light were increased in intensity, the colour of the red
immediately appeared, and it was only after making a comparison
for colour with the stronger white that the red colour truly ap
peared to be colourless.      In this then evidently the part of the retina
on which the red colour was received was stimulated by the white
adjacent to it and to such an extent that the supposed extinguished
colour reappeared.       Presumably then whilst the retina is excited bv
diluted colour, the part on which the pure white may fall may also
 be excited by it, and not necessarily by the exact complementary
colour, since the eye is more sensitive to some colours than to others.
Whatever view may be taken of this hypothesis, must not, however,
be allowred to detract from the results of the experiments, which are
facts—recorded and observed with all possible care—and after due
precautions were taken to avoid error.

III.  “ On some Phenomena in Vacuum-tubes.”
                                                            By Sir DAVID
      SALOMONS,     Bart, M.A., V.-P., Inst. Elec. Engrs. Commu
      nicated by Prof. D. E. HUGHES, F.R.S. Received April 30,
      1894.
   This paper is a contribution upon the    phenomenon      known as striae,
or bands, in vacuum tubes.
   As far  as I  can learn from the sources     of information available to
me, no one has yet discovered how to produce a predetermined number
of bright and dark bands in a tube having an open or free path.
   After  a prolonged investigation   I have   succeeded  in producing this
result.
   This <U+FB01>rst step having been attained, it is evident that a. number of
experiments are available for con<U+FB01>rming the theories at present held
in regard to the subject, or possibly for modifying existing views, or
even to form some additional theory, it necessary.
   I do not think that it would be judicious, at the present stage of
my experiments, which are by no means complete, to enter upon
any theoretical considerations, although some conclusions might
suggest themselves which, however, until the work has been greatly
extended, would possibly lead to error.
   It would appear that the main efforts of those experimenting with
vacuum-tubes have been in the direction of securing very high ex
 haustions and using currents‘of very high electromotive force.           In
 many cases also currents having a high frequency have been em
ployed.
   When     I began these investigations, about twenty years ago, the
chief dif<U+FB01>culty was to know at what point to commence.           After due
consideration    I decided upon the following course :—
   A very large number of vacuum-tubes were “ lit up,” and all tubes
which showed a somewhat similar phenomenon were carefully ex
amined, and their characteristics noted.          It is probable that the
 number of tubes so examined considerably exceeded a thousand,
 perhaps several thousands.
    At last it became quite clear that, to produce a de<U+FB01>nite pheno
 menon, the tube must be given some de<U+FB01>nite characteristic; and
 having settled this point I was enabled to start upon a systematic in
 vestigation.
    There is no object to be gained by detailing the reasons which led
 me to work in the manner      I                        I
                                 did, and, therefore, will be content to
 give the results.
    When    I use the word vacuum-tube       I  employ it in the ordinary
 sense.   In  all the experiments to be described the tubes contain ex

 23                     Sir David Salomons, Bart.                 [June  21,
 hausted air, and the current employed is an alternate current.         The
 experiments here mentioned must, therefore, be regarded as a <U+FB01>rst
 instalment.     They will have to be repeated, with an intermittent
 direct current and with tubes containing various gases, and probably
 also tubes containing various vapours, and all these at various ex
 haustions and temperatures. ,
     I have already made a large number of experiments employing
 tubes containing di<U+FB01>erent gases and with direct, as well as alternate
 current.    I  may, therefore, mention that the phenomena about to be
 described, when using the alternate current, appear to he the same
 with the direct current, except that the phenomena peculiar to direct
currents, in the form of the bands, make themselves apparent.           But,
 until these experiments have been completed,      I will not refer to them
any further in this paper.       I <U+FB01>nd it necessary to work in the con
 trary manner to that which is usually adopted.
    1. The alternations are made so slow that blinks are produced in
the tube under observation, which correspond to the reversals; and
then the alternations are increased in speed until the tubes appear
continuously lightened.       This is my starting point.        I  have the
means of raising the frequency when desired.           The apparatus for
producing the alternate current, in the <U+FB01>rst instance, is a Pyke and
Harris alternator driven by an electromotor, hence as the frequency
increases so does the electromotive force; I am therefore obliged,
when describing the experiments, to employ the expression “ electric
          ”
energy      or “ current ” in order to avoid confusion.
    2. Since   I use currents of such low frequency the electromotive
 force also is very low; and the quantity of current traversing any
tube is small.
    3. The tubes are not very highly exhausted,        they are only ex
hausted to approximately 0'5 mm. of mercury, according to the usual
mode of comparative measurement.           But I <U+FB01>nd that, whether the
tubes are highly exhausted or not, provided the current passes, all
the phenomena are the same. At a very early stage of the investi
gation I observed that the ordinary methods of working, i.e., with
currents of high electromotive force, masked the effects              I was
seeking.
    In giving the subject   a logical sequence so that each step may be
noted,   I have  no doubt that I shall describe several eifects which are
already known.       But to omit these, which I am unable to single out,
would be to lose    the thread of the history.
    In a scienti<U+FB01>c paper it is usual to prove some de<U+FB01>nite point or to
show some special new phenomenon.            It is therefore desirable to
point out the object aimed at in this communication.
    The object    I originally had in view was simply to discover a
method by which vacuum-tubes could be made to give a prede

  1894.]            On some Phenomena in Vacuum-tubes.                 231
  termined number of bright and dark bands, as it appeared to me this
  would be the <U+FB01>rst step in examining the laws which govern their pro
  duction.            I
             In this succeeded at a very early stage. But, in order to
 make the proofs more convincing, other experiments were entered
 upon which brought to light a number of new points of considerable
 interest; and many of these experiments appeared to throw con
 siderable light as to the origin of the bands.
     The object of this paper, therefore, is, <U+FB01>rst, to show the methods
  by which a de<U+FB01>nite number of bright and dark bands can be pro
  duced in a vacuum-tube; and, secondly, to describe a number of
 interesting phenomena which have a bearing on the production of the
 bands in general.
     The <U+FB01>rst step is to describe the apparatus employed in making the
 experiments.      A small direct-current motor is coupled directly to the
 smallest sized Pyke and Harris laboratory alternator. The alternate
 current produced can be made to vary its EMF. according to the
 speed given to the motor and also by varying the exciting current.
 The           of the alternate current can be made variable from O to
 100 volts, and the maximum current which the machine is intended
 to give is 3 ampéres.        The pressure of this current is raised by
 means of a Pyke and Harris oil transformer or with a Salomops and
 Pyke combination transformer.        Sometimes one form of transformer
 is used and sometimes the other.          It is usual to give the exact
 electromotive forces of the current employed, as well as its periodi
 city, but in the following experiments it is not necessary that this
 should be known accurately, from the very nature of the experiments,
 because, as already mentioned, the experiments were started with ex
 ceedingly slow alternations and a very low E.M.F., which were
 gradually raised, the phenomena being watched throughout as they
 varied.
    It is essential that the speed of the motor should be under complete
command, and that the speed should be made variable during any
experiment. To attain this end         I employ a Kelvin rheostat and a
 Wirt   rheostat.
    All the tubes employed, so far as their exterior form is considered,
may be regarded as practically of one type; long tubes of varying
lengths and large diameters, many of them containing small devices
which consist of little glass disks, glass rods, and other arrangements
for modifying the nature of the electric discharge, and, for want of a
better name,      I term them “ de<U+FB02>ectors.”      Although, perhaps, the
word “moderator” is more applicable, it has another meaning, and
its employment here might give rise to confusion.
    In many of the experiments to be described the bands appear to
be repelled from some part or parts in the tube towards the elec
trodes.    I feel some di<U+FB02>iculty in selecting language suitable for de

232                     Sir David Salomons, Bart.                [June   21,
scribing this e<U+FB01>ect, for although to the eye repulsion is evident, it
may not, from a scienti<U+FB01>c point of view, be correct in fact.             The
appearance may be explained in a variety of ways, but in order to
simplify description of the experiments I treat the appearance as a
repulsion.    However, it must not in consequence be inferred that re
pulsion really does take place.
    The experiments are here given in their logical order, although in
point of fact they were not originally made in this sequence.          In all
investigations    it occurs almost invariably  that an experiment   is  made
which suggests the previous steps that are necessary to obtain a
logical order, and indeed some of these steps are frequently unob
tainable. Therefore, it is very probable that what I believe at pre
sent to be the sequence may yet have missing links.
    Some of the conclusions which may be drawn from the following
experiments are :—
    That bands may be produced with greater facility in small tubes
than in large, and that they become more accentuated probably on
account of the inequality of the diameter of such tubes.
    That for the production of bands, the glass of the tube itself ap
pears to play a part, since the bands are dit<U+FB01>cult to produce unless
they reach to the glass of the tube.
    That an exceedingly minute current produces bands which to the
 eye, in most instances, disappear when the current is somewhat in
 creased, and on further increasing the current they become visible
 again.    I believe that in all previous investigations it has been stated
 that the bands cannot be produced until a considerable current is
 passed. Irefer to investigations by Messrs. Warren de la Rue, Gassiot,
 and others. My experiments prove the contrary. The probable reason
 why these statements were made is due to the fact that with the ap
 paratus employed at that time such small currents could not be
 easily produced.      When the minute current is increased, and the
 bands seem to disappear,      I  think this is only an optical illusion;
 the bands are there, but too faint to be seen, perhaps in conse
 quence of the dark bands being             so narrow that     they escape
 observation.
     That, when an electric discharge takes place in a large tube in
 which is placed a partition pierced with a hole, “a forcing e<U+FB02>iect ”
 frequently appears to be produced. Any bright bands being pro
 duced at the hole in the partition may give the appearance of being
 pushed through to the side of the tube which has the greater length.
  This phenomenon is mentioned because it is apt to mask many
 elfects, unless the current is suitably adjusted.
     That it is not impossible, after the <U+FB01>rst trace of light becomes
  visible in a tube when passing a very minute current; that the dark
  bands subsequent to this stage are illusory, and that they are really

the bright bands ; and what appear to be the bright bands consist of
overlaps which produce double the brightness of the so-called dark
bands. In reality, therefore, the bright bands indicate the position
of the dark bands.        (See <U+FB01>g. A.)

    That by   devices bands can be produced        in  a large tube occupying
only a small portion of the cross sectional area, at any rate so far as
the eye can discern.
    That, when employing Professor Crookes’ tubes for illustrating
 experiments on radiant matter, if' suitable conditions are observed,
 striaa are formed in these tubes.
    That, in tubes having exceedingly small electrodes, and apparently
not capable of producing striae, these can be shown to exist if very
minute currents are employed.
    That the tube, when made to act as a condenser, permits more
current to pass.
     That from the above considerations it is not unlikely that a view,
which has been held, in regard to the probable origin of the bands,
that they consist of a series of discharges through the tube, is true;
that the nature of such discharge can be varied by suitable devices
placed within the tubes, and that the examination of the nature of
the discharge can be best made with very minute currents, that is to
say, currents so small that, if made any less, the tube would no longer
 show any sign of light.

 number of the experiment.           This accounts for the absence of <U+FB01>g. 10.
 The experiments were made with the tubes supported horizontally
 (with the exception of tube <U+FB01>g. 12). This position was chosen for
the sake of convenience, the results being the same for all positions.

                                 Experiment   1.
  A  plain tube of large diameter with aluminium brush electrodes at
the ends   is employed.    (See <U+FB01>g. 1.)    On passing an electric dis
charge, with very slow alternations, at <U+FB01>rst the tube appears dark,
and the speed of the alternator then being slightly increased, the
light just becomes visible within the tube, and there is seen a few
bright bands with dark spaces intePVening. These bands are convex,
the convexity being towards the centre of the tube in all cases.  The
bands do not extend to the centre of the tube, consequently the con
vex sides of the bands at each end of the tube face one another, and
do not meet in the centre of the tube.     The motor is then stopped,
and the falling light in the tube is carefully watched. It can then
be noticed that the moment before the current dies out, and the
 bands disappear, one or two more appear nearer to the centre.     On
the other  hand, if the current is increased the bands are driven to
wards the electrodes until they disappear altogether.     The tube is
then simply lighted throughout.
   The experiment is now repeated when a current is adjusted to pro
duce the bands, and the centre of the tube is placed to earth by
resting the hand upon it or in any other convenient manner, when it

 will   be observed    that the bands approach towards the centre, but
 still do not <U+FB01>ll the tube ; sometimes one or two new bands appear.       It
 is di<U+FB01>icult at present to   say why   this should be  the case, for, apart
 from other views which may be taken, the following two conditions
 might exist :—
    1. If the apparent repulsion of the bands is due to the electri<U+FB01>ca
 tion of the glass of the tube, then an effect is produced somewhat
 similar to that in the gold leaf electroscope, and by placing the hand
 upon the tube, a discharge being produced, the bands will approach
 in the same way as in the case of the leaves of an ,electroscope when
 discharged, but the glass being a bad conductor, the discharge is
 partial only.
    2. The view might be taken that when the hand is placed on the
 tube a condenser is formed, and the surface of the glass within the
 tube becomes more highly electri<U+FB01>ed, and the approach of the bands
 is due to this cause.    If this explanation is true, the ocular effect of

    Adjust the current in any vacuum tube until the discharge is just
 visible.   Now carefully reduce the current until the tube is dark, i.e.,
 when there is no visible discharge. If the hand is now placed on the
 tube the latter will light up bright-1y.     If the adjustment is made
 with su<U+FB01>icient care, the very fact of placing the hand within an inch
 or so of the tube will cause it to light up as if by magic. The re
 pulsion effect may also be true, although it appears to me evident
 that more current <U+FB02>owing into the tube, when the outside is
 earthed, is in no way caused by any discharge from the interior of
 the tube.                                                   -

    A similar tube was employed, but it contained in the centre of its
length a very slight glass rod, attached to the side, supporting a
short thick glass rod lying along the axis of the tube (see <U+FB01>g. 2, where
dimensions are given, as in the case of other <U+FB01>gs).         The object of
this experiment is to see whether the repulsive e<U+FB01>ect would be in
creased; or, if not increased, whether the phenomenon could be made
more clear. The latter proved to be the case. In passing the current
in the same manner as in the previous experiment, bands were formed
throughout the length of the tube, one appearing at the centre of the
little rod and one at each end or near the ends of the rod. On in

the bands are farther driven back until at last the tube appears <U+FB01>lled
with light without any trace of striaa. From these two experiments
I conclude that, in a large number of cases, the phenomenon of bands
is masked in consequence of too much current being employed.
Similar tubes, with glass discs at the end of the rod were used, and
with same effect, see <U+FB01>g. 2A. Some of the experiments which follow
clearly explain how this masking effect    produced.

Several tubes are used in this experiment, and in many instances by
lowering the current the time arrives when the two bright bands, on

these bands leave the edges of the disks to some distance from them,

  structed in this manner. the bright bands are repeated along them,
  the distance corresponding with the distance between the bright
 bands formed at each side of any disk. On increasing the current,
  very considerably in consequence of the bands on the glass disks
  receding from the latter, a confusion is set up throughout the tube,
  i.e., the hands all mix together, especially as they become somewhat
  wider at the same time as they recede from the glass disks, till <U+FB01>nally
  the whole tube appears generally lit without any bands being seen.
  Some tubes will melt before obtaining this effect.
      I, therefore, conclude that the absence of bands is generally due to
 this cause, i.e., the bands are really there, but in consequence of too
 much current they have become expanded and overlap one another
 so often as to render their existence invisible.      Some very instruc
 tive experiments for the examination of this e<U+FB01>ect will shortly be
 described.
     Tubes with three and four disks on the rods were also used, and
 these produced similar e<U+FB01>ects.      (See <U+FB01>gs. 3A and 3B.)
                                Ezperimnt    4.
     This experiment and     some of those which follow are made      with a
 view of determining the possibility of producing a given number of
 bands in a vacuum tube. The possibility of doing this might already
 be inferred from the experiments described.         If it is generally true
 that any two bands produced at one end of a tube are repeated
throughout the tube at the same distance apart as the <U+FB01>rst pair
formed, and if it is true that any impediment within the tube will
 produce a pair of bands, then the problem is solved; and       I think the
following tubes show that such is the case.
     The tube shown in <U+FB01>g. 41 has its ends contracted and re-expanded
into bulbs, in which the electrodes are placed.         At one end, where
the contraction exists, a short tube is melted on, which carries a little
hollow sphere of glass with three holes so situated that, if a. line be
drawn from the centre of any hole to the centre of the glass sphere,
an angle of approximately 45° is made with the axis of the tube.
There is melted on the top of the glass sphere a short rod projecting into
the free part of the tube, the axis of the rod coinciding with the axis
of the tube.       When the current is passed there should be formed a
bright band at the base of the rod close to where the current issues
from the three holes in the sphere, and another one at the free end of
the rod. Then throughout the tube there should be produced bright
bands equidistantly placed, such distance being equal, or approxi
mately equal, to the length of the little rod ; and, on passing the
current, this proves to be the case. When the amount of current;
passed is exceedingly small, distinct, narrow, bright bands become

visible, with absolutely dark, wide spaces between them.    On increas
ing the current, the bright bands expand, the dark spaces growing
narrower till at last the bright bands touch one another and then
overlap. Then the paradox occurs that the dark bands appear bright
and the bright bands appear dark; i.e., the bright bands overlap
where the dark spaces should be, and therefore appear doubly as
bright as the remaining portion of the bright bands, which now
appear dark by contrast.
   From experiments conducted on other tubes        I think it is quite
clear that this is the usual condition of things, and that it is exceed
ingly rare that the true black bands are really seen. But in this
experiment there is one point of interest which must not be over
looked. It is, that whether the current be small or large, the rule
set up by the little red at the end of the tube cannot be upset.     The

number of bands in the tube will not advance nor recede, nor alter
their number in any way; neither can they be made to disappear by
increasing the current as in other cases. The only thing that happens
is that the bright bands grow wider as the current is increased till
the paradox referred to is apparent.
   This same experiment is made on a number of tubes built in a
similar fashion, but having di<U+FB01>erent dimensions. The result, how
ever, is always the same.   The overlapping of the bright bands may
occur again and again, so that the dark spaces are <U+FB01>rst bright, then
dark, then again bright, and so on, until the tube is destroyed by‘the
excess of current passed.

result follows. The object of this experiment was to see whether the
glass disk would set up its own hands independently of those due to
the rod, but the rodappears to gain the mastery.    Probably the two
bands formed by the glass disk are driven (or repelled) into one by
the rod.
                              Experiment   6.
  I   next tried the eEect of contractions to see whether the same
result would not be produced as if the de<U+FB02>ector rod were employed.
Several forms of tubes are used : in some cases a little glass sphere,
as described in the previous experiment, without the rod attached to
it ; in other cases the tube was contracted for a de<U+FB01>nite length and then
expanded ; in other cases disks of glass and of mica were inserted with
holes in the centre, as shown in <U+FB01>gs. 6, 6A, and 6B.      The same results
are produced as with the rod; the distance of the bright bands apart
being equal, in the <U+FB01>rst tube, to the distance between the holes in the
glass sphere and its electrode; in the second tube, to the length of
the contracted tube; and in the ,third tube, to the distance between
the holes in the disk and its nearest electrode.
    When a tube, containing a glass or mica screen with a hole in
                                                                       it,

 employed, one of the three effects may be produced :—
       Broad bands throughout the tube, as already mentioned.
  2. 1.
       Very narrow bands, their distance apart being equal to the
 distance between the two bright bands formed on both sides of the
 screen in the tube.
   3.  N0 bands in the tube, or only a confusion of bands, and no
 distinct bands on either side of the disk. Unless this circumstance
 were pointed out,  it    might prove misleading to anyone trying the
 experiment.   I   tried a large number of tubes built up in this manner,
 in order to discover the cause of the different phenomena.
    It would appear that broad bands are produced when the distance
 between the disk and its nearest electrode     is   suitably adjusted. If
 the screen is placed far away from the electrode, bands are produced
 on each side of the disk, and they are reproduced throughout the
 tube. If the screen     is  placed nearer to its electrode, the two disks
 appear to   be driven into one, and broad bands are produced.       If the
 screen   isplaced htill nearer to the electrode, then what should be the
 two bands on either side of the disk are driven through the hole, and
 appear as a hemisphere of light on the side of the tube which          the

 longest. In this case bands may or may not be produced, and,               if
 present, they are irregular.
    These three e<U+FB01>ects can be produced by varying the current in many
 instances, and very probably in all cases; but, as a rule, the tubes
  break down before all the effects can be shown.
     Again, plain tubes are employed with electrodes of varying lengths.

 The length of the electrode acted in the same way as did the de<U+FB02>ector
 rod  in Experiment 4:.     It is, therefore, clear that in arranging
 Experiment 4 it was necessary to have the length of the rod some
 multiple of the distance between the holes in the glass sphere and its
 electrode;  also that the length of the glass rod should be some
 de<U+FB01>nite multiple of the distance between the contraction of the tube
at the farther end and its electrode; also that the length of the
electrodes should be short compared with any of these distances;
otherwise a confusion of bands would be set up.
    The experiment with the disk of glass placed at the end of the
 de<U+FB02>ector rod showed that any e<U+FB01>ect which could be produced by this
disk alone was overpowered by the effects produced by the rod.
This would appear evident, since the two bands which would be
formed by the disk would practically be driven (or repelled) into one
by the action of the rod; the independent action of the electrodes
in the case of Experiment 4! being absent may be due to the same
reason.
    I had considerable dif<U+FB01>culty in getting over these points, for, at
<U+FB01>rst,'confused results were presented in some tubes and not in others,
and it was only after investigating the matter, as here mentioned,
that   I was able to construct tubes without di<U+FB02>iculty to give de<U+FB01>nite
results when these various details were attended to.

has two electrodes  at each end. Another tube has very small elec~
trodes, while others have various sizes of electrodes.    In all these

   It ought to be mentioned that in some cases the effects can only be
observed by passing a considerable quantity of current through the
tube and then turning off the alternator, so that     runs slower and

                 stops.  The light in the tubes gradually diminishes
until they are dark. Many effects can only be observed at the moment
of extinction. Some tubes, in which it appears impossible to show
the bands, give the phenomenon most distinctly at the instant
referred to.

  Tubes are employed as shown in <U+FB01>g. 11. They consist of plain
tubes, the ends of which are expanded into bulbs that contain the

electrodes.   Glass balls are blown on the contracted portions, so that
these  glass balls become the electrodes for the tube proper wholly
and solely by induction, there being no connexion between the glass
tube proper and the electrodes, except through the glass of these
balls. Again the e<U+FB01>ects produced are the same as       if  the current
were passed without the inductive process, i.e., the bands are pro
duced in  a similar manner.

                               Imperiment 12.
   It has  already been said that the glass itself appears to assist in
the formation    of the bands. This may be due to the electri<U+FB01>cation
of the glass or to some other circumstance. In any case the bands
have a tendency to stick to the glass with some pertinacity.           The
most convincing way to show this is by means of a tube lit up by
 induction in a manner similar to the type of tube employed in the
experiment last described. A tube is employed with inductor elec
trodes consisting of glass balls, but the main tube consists of one
contracted near the glass balls and then expanded, in the centre of
its length, into a large sphere (see <U+FB01>g. 12). When such a tube is lit
up the results must be looked for in the large glass sphere.        It will
be noticed that bands are formed at the entrances           to the sphere,
somewhat parabolic in shape, 11.6., the centres of the bands appear
driven towards the centre of the sphere, while the edges of the bands
seem to stick to the glass and to be retarded.          On increasing the
current the bands expand somewhat, and become slightly more
numerous, and eventually a few of the most forward ones suddenly
leave the glass sides and agree with the equatorial plane.          (Figs.
12A and 1213 give a rough idea of the two stages.)
                              Experiment 13.
   To further illustrate the action of the glass in the formation of
bands, a long tube is employed    with a number of bulbs blown along
the length of the tube at short distances apart. (See <U+FB01>g. 13.)          On
passing the current, bands are formed along the whole length of the
tube, excepting at those places where the spheres are blown.            At
these places the bright bands disappear.       If the current is consider
ably increased, the bright bands enter a certain distance into the
spheres. These are not independent bands, but those driven out of
the straight portions of the tube (the bands having become expanded),
which is very easily observed when adjusting the current and watching
the tube.
                             Experiment   14:.
   Professor Fleming suggested that, in order to make some of the
experiments more convincing, the open tube and tube with a disk
should be combined.
   I  therefore employed a tube shown in <U+FB01>g. 14 for this purpose.
The tube is a plain tube, and at one end, 4.0 mm. from the electrode, a
glass disk is hinged from the side of the tube.      This disk may lie <U+FB02>at
on the tube or stand vertical (as shown in the diagram) at pleasure,
by tilting the tube or by turning it upon its axis. This tube must be
placed horizontally in order to raise or lower the disk.

      of Phase between E.M.F. and Current in any Alternating
      Current System.”      By Major P. CARDEW, RE. Communi
      cated by Lord KELVIN, P.R.S.        Received June 21, 1894.
   If the periodic time of an alternating E.M.F  be T, and if, owing to
the presence of capacity or self-induction, or both in the circuit, the
current passes through the value 0 at times differing from the times
of passage of the E.M.F. through the same value by t, the electrical
power will be VXCX cos (27rt/T), where V indicates the effective
volts and C the e<U+FB01>ective current.
   If a momentary contact be made at intervals exactly synchronising
with the period of the alternating E.M.F. to complete the circuit of
a suitable and suitably connected galvanometer, and if the time of

  occurrence of this contact can be adjusted to any instant of the
  period T, the instant of passage of the alternating             or current
  through 0 from positive to negative, or vice versa'l, can be accurately
  determined.
     The contact need not be absolutely momentary if the needle of the
  galvanometer have inertia suf<U+FB01>cient, nor need it occur in each
  period, provided that the recurring period be an exact multiple of
  the alternating period.
     On the principles enunciated above, the following simple appa
  ratus has 'been devised for the exact measurement            of the angle
 21rt/ T :—
     A cylinder of boxwood or ebonite is     caused to rotate synchron
 ously with the alternating current generator, making one revolution
 to a complete period, either by direct connexion of its axle with that
 of the machine through suitable multiplying gear, in a manner
 similar to that used for the ordinary velocimeter, or by driving it by
 a synchronising motor.
     In the surface of the cylinder is embedded one metal wire or strip
 parallel with the axle, and connected to the axle or to a contact ring.
    Two insulated springs press against the surface of the cylinder;
 one of these, called the Volt brush V, is attached to a dial face
 accurately marked with degrees, centred at the axis of revolution,
 and capable of rotation round this axis, and. provided with clamping
 and slow motion screws; the other brush, called the current brush
 C, is attached to an index moving over the face of the dial, and also
 provided with clamping and slow motion screws.             For very exact
 measurement the index may carry a vernier.
    The brushes are so arranged that they make simultaneous contact
 with the wire on the cylinder when the index is exactly at the
 zero of the dial, and the cylinder is rotated. This is tested by means
 of a battery and galvanometer, and the brushes are provided with
 suitable means of adjustment.      If the wire is of appreciable width,
 the adjustment of the brushes should be such as to give maximum
 de<U+FB02>ection on the galvanometer.
    The connexions are as follows :—One terminal of the alternator is
 connectedto the axle or contact ring of the cylinder by means of an
 ordinary rubbing contact ; Brush V is connected to a sensitive dead
beat galvauometer, which can be shunted at will, and coils of
su<U+FB01>icient impedance to enable the shunted galvanometer to withstand
the full E.M.F., and to the other terminal of the alternator; Brush C
is connected through a resistance which can be out out of circuit to
a low resistance galvanometer, and thence to a point on the main
connected with the axle of the cylinder at a short distance from this
connexion, so that a short piece of main is a shunt to this galva
nometer and contact.

252         Major Cardew and Major Bagnold.         On the    [June  21,
   The modus operandi is <U+FB01>rst to adjust the dial and Brush V until
Galvanometer V remains at zero, then adjust the index and Brush C
until Galvanometer C remains at zero. The angle indicated is then
exactly 21rt/T, measuring the difference of phase between E.M.F. and
current.
   It will be seen that as this is a null method, the self-induction of
the galvanometer circuits does not a<U+FB02>'ect the results.

      CARDEW, R.E., and Major BAGNOLD, R.E.            Communicated
      by LORD KELVIN, P.R.S. Received June 21, 1894.
   On the 8th January, 1894, an accident occurred at Bournemouth of
an unusual nature.     An omnibus was in the act of drawing up in the
roadway    outside the  Imperial Hotel, when the horses suddenly fell
down, and one of them died in a few minutes.
   All the men who assisted in extricating the horses felt tingling sen
sations in their limbs suggestive of electrical shock, and the con
nexion from the mains of the Bournemouth Electric Light Company
to the hotel was known to pass underneath the spot at which the
accidentoccurred.
   This Company use the high pressure alternating system at 2,000
volts pressure, and in the case of this hotel the transformers were
installed upon the premises.
   On investigation, a defect in the insulation of one of the high pres
sure service lines was discovered, from which sparking had evidently
taken place to the enclosing lé-in. wrought iron pipe.
   This pipe was 32 ft. long, laid at a depth of about 18 in., and ter
minated at a brick junction box under the roadway, and a brick and
cement area wall at the hotel.     The ends were thus fairly insulated,
 while the rest of the pipe was in contact with the earth.
   The accident took place during the progress of a thaw, after a
very severe frost.
   Upon consideration of the case, Major Cardew reported to the
Board of Trade that in his opinion the accident was caused by
leakage from the short length of charged pipe, a<U+FB01>ecting the poten
tial of the surface of the ground to such an extent that between
the fore and hind feet of the horse a suf<U+FB01>cient di<U+FB01>f'erence of poten
tial was established to give rise to the current which proved fatal.
    At the same time, as the fact of such a result following from a
 simple contact with ordinary road material was a new experience of

the possible dangers attending the commercial supply of electrical
energy, it was thought desirable to repeat the conditions as nearly
as possible, and measure the results obtained.
    As such an experiment could not, for obvious reasons,      be satis
factorily carried out in London, it was arranged that it should be
tried at Chatham, where the necessary apparatus was available.
    A <U+FB01>rst experiment was made on the 26th January, 1894. In this a
length of 33 ft. 3 in. of 2-in. iron pipe was buried to a depth of
18 in. within the salient of one of the demi-bastions at St. Mary’s
                                                                   '
Barracks, Chatham.
    A piece of well insulated 37-straud No. 16 cable was inserted in
this pipe so that the ends of the conductors made good contact
with the inside of the pipe at its centre point.
    Over the centre of pipe two 56-lb. weights were placed on the
 surface of the ground, and at a distance of It ft. laterally another
 pair of 56-lb. weights were similarly placed.
    A 16-kilowatt alternator was connected by means of an under
 ground cable laid in stoneware pipes to the piece of cable in the
 2-in. pipe.
    The other pole of the alternator was connected to a lé-in. service
 pipe in connexion with the barrack water mains. One end of this
 service pipe was in connexion with a hydraulic ram set in the ground
 at a distance of 140 ft. from the piece of buried pipe.
    An SOD-volt. Thomson static voltmeter was connected across the
 terminals of the alternator, and a pair of leads, well insulated,
 were attached by means of screws to the two pairs of weights situ
 ated over the buried pipe.     These leads were run back together to
 the experiment room, and were connected alternately to a -14(l-volt
 static voltmeter and a Cardew voltmeter.
    The voltage of the alternator was varied by means of the exciting
 current which was taken from accumulators.
    The readings on both voltmeters are given in Table I.
    As the earth resistance was rather low, the alternator could not be
 run up above 400 volts without overheating the armature.
    Fig. 1 is a diagram of the arrangement.
    The results show a potential difference between points 41 ft. apart
 on the surface of over 20 per cent. of the whole P.D. used to charge
 the pipe when measured statically, and even when a current of nearly
  1/10 ampere was drawn from the ground through a Cardew volt
  meter the P.D. was more than 10 per cent. of the whole.
     The propiuquity of the scarp walls, however, appeared likely to
  have, to some extent, in<U+FB02>uenced the direction of the lines of <U+FB02>ow of
  current, and it was determined to repeat it, changing the position of
  the pipe and extending the tests to a greater distance from the pipe.
  The second experiment was carried out on the 16th March, 1894.

   while between weights C and      D the P.D., even with 610 volt charging
   pressure, was too small for exact measurement.

  made    consistent with the evident approach of the curve to its
  asymptote at D. In this case, therefore, the effect of the leakage
  extended to a distance of about 141 ft. from the pipe, and the fall of
  potential on the surface appears to have been most rapid ata distance
 from the line immediately above the pipe equal to twice the depth at
 which it was buried.
     A third experiment was carried out on the 22nd May, 1894, with
 the same arrangements as in the second experiment. The objects for
 which this was undertaken were chie<U+FB02>y to obtain a record of the
variation of P.D. on the surface with the charging current, which
had not been previously recorded, to obtain results from charging
with continuous, as well as alternating, current, and to extend the
investigation as regards the latter.
     Unfortunately, the continuous current generator could not be used,
owing to a mechanical defect, which could not be removed in the
limited time available. Still, the results obtained with alternating
current are, it is considered, of some value, especially as the condition
of the ground was different from that which existed at the time of
    VOL. LYI.                                                        s

the charging pressure was connected to these points and observations
taken, when the exciting current for the <U+FB01>eld magnets of the dynamo
and the charging current to the pipe were practically the same as in
a previous set of experiments, for which the charging volts were
known.      Both sets of experiments are shown in the table. The dis
turbance of the worms was again very distinct, and they appeared,
on reaching the surface, to set their bodies parallel to the pipe, or
along an equipotential line.
   The experiments, as a whole, show conclusively that, under very
different conditions of weather and amount of moisture in the soil, it
is possible to produce a fall of potential amounting to 25 per cent. of
the whole pressure in the supply between points on the surface of the
ground 4! ft. apart, a distance which most horses stand over, and,
further, that, although the connexion of such points by a conducting
 body naturally reduces this potential difference, yet, when this con
ductor has about the resistance of a horse (say 400 ohms), su<U+FB01>lcient
current will pass to give a severe shock.
   It is hoped that, when opportunity serves, these experiments may
be extended to the case of pipes buried togreater depths, and to
observe whether any difference is produced by the use of a steady, in
place of an alternating pressure.

      Hannay by means of his Microrheometer.” By ROBERT
      E. BARNETT, A.R.C.S. Communicated by Professor T. F.
       THORPE, F.R.S.       Received May 6, 1894.

‘Philosophical Transactions

                                    for 1879, Vol.  170, p. 275, Mr. J. B.
Hannay     describes  an apparatus with which he made measurements
of the rate of <U+FB02>ow of water, and of some aqueous saline solutions
through a capillary tube, and he deduces from the observations cer
tain relations between the chemical nature of the salt dissolved, and
its effect on the rate of <U+FB02>ow of water.
   Inasmuch as Mr. Hannay furnishes us with details of the dimen
sions of his apparatus,      I have, at Professor Thorpe’s suggestion,
transformed his relative numbers into absolute measure of viscosity
in order to compare his results with those of other workers. The
data given are as follows :—
                 Diameter of capillary tube =      00938 mm.
                 Length           ,,          =  21 mm.
                 Capacity of glass bulb       =    4'0530 c.c.
    The time of <U+FB02>ow was measured by a stop-watch, and each number
 recorded was the mean of ten observations.
                                                                 s 2

         THOMPSON,      F.R.S.    Received June 12, 1894.
     In the   course of experiments made       with the view of realising as a
 practical standard of light,     the  method   of using one square millimetre
 or other de<U+FB01>nite area of the crater of the positive carbon of an
 electric arc,* the author has found that the e<U+FB01>ective luminosity is.
 not as theory would predict,‘|' either constant or uniform.               By the
 use of a double Rumford photometer, giving alternating <U+FB01>elds, as in
 9. Vernon Harcourt photometer, his attention was called to a. bright
 spot at or near the middle of the crater. The use of rotating sectors
 accidentally revealed that a periodic phenomenon accompanied the
 appearance of this bright spot, and although it is more marked with
 a short humming arc, the author believes that it is always present.
     An image of the crater was thrown on a screen by a photographic
 lens; and a disc having 60 arms and 60 openings of 3°, and
 rotating at from 100 to 400 revolutions per minute, was placed near
the screen.        Curious stroboscopic images were observed, indicating a
 continually varying periodicity seldom higher than 450 per second,
 most frequently about 100, dif<U+FB01>cult to distinguish below 50 per
 second, and becoming with a long are a mere <U+FB02>icker.                The period
 seemed to correspond with the musical hum of the arc, which gener
 ally breaks into a hiss at a note a little beyond 4150 per second. The
 hum is audible in a telephone in the circuit, or in shunt to it. The
 current was taken from the mains of the Kensington and Knights
 bridge Electric Light Company, often late at night, after all the
 dynamos had been shut down.               The carbons were, of course, not
 cored;    six  kinds were used.
     A rotating disc was arranged near the lens, to allow the beam to
pass for about 1/lOOOth of a second, and to be cut off for about
 1/100th of a second.        It was then found that a bright patch, occupy
ing about one quarter of the crater, appeared to be rapidly revolving.
Examination of the shape of this patch showed that it consisted of
the bright spot already mentioned, and of a curved appendage which
swept round, sometimes changing the direction of its rotation.                This
appendage seemed to be approximately equivalent to a quadrant
sheared concentrically through 90°.           Distinct variations in the lumi
nosity of the crater are probably due to the fact that this is only an
approximation.

1894.]       Electric Strength of Mixtures of  ZVitrogen, (5-0.    263
   The a priori theory of the constant temperature of the crater is so
attractive, that the author is inclined to attribute this phenomenon,
not to any actual change of the luminosity of the crater, or to any
wandering of the luminous area, as is seen with a long, unsteady arc,
but to the refraction of the light by heated vapour. All experiments,
such as enclosing the arc in a small chamber of transparent mica, or
the use of magnets, or an air blast, have failed to produce any
e<U+FB01>ect.    A distortion of the image of the crater while the patch re
volves, has been looked for, but nothing distinguishable from changes
of luminosity has .been seen.
   An unexpected dif<U+FB01>culty is thus introduced in the use of the are as
a standard of light, and one which may interfere with its use under
some circumstances as a steady and continuous source of light.     The
author is further examining this phenomenon, with the view of
ascertaining its nature, and of <U+FB01>nding practical conditions under
which it is absent or negligible.
VIII.    “ The Electric Strength of Mixtures of Nitrogen and
       Hydrogen.”      By Miss P. G. FAWGETT. Communicated by
       Professor J. J. THOMSON, F.R.S.       Received June 21, 1894.
    The    experiments described in this paper were undertaken at
 Professor Thomson’s suggestion, and have been carried out with the
 advantage of his advice and help.
    The immediate object of the experiments was to determine the
 electromotive force required to produce a spark between two <U+FB02>at
parallel metal plates in a mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen in di<U+FB01>er
 ent proportions and at different pressures.
    The hydrogen used was obtained by electrolysis of water, as it was
 found that that obtained in the ordinary way from zinc and hydro
 chloric acid was liable to contain impurities which seriously a<U+FB02>ected
its electric strength.
    The two gases were collected over water in a graduated cylindrical
 gas-holder, and were allowed to stand for some hours to give them
 time to mix before being put into the apparatus. The mixture was
 passed through sulphuric acid, and also through cotton wool to
 remove dust.
    The electromotive force was supplied by a battery of storage cells,
 each of about 2 volts, and was measured simply by counting the
 number of cells.      The strength of the cells was measured by a
 quadrant electrometer.      I
    At very low pressures it was found that, unless special precautions
  were taken to prevent the discharge passing anywhere except between

264       Miss P. G. Fawcett.         The   Electric Strength of   [June 21,
the opposed faces of the plates, it would take a longer path, and pass
between the connecting wires on the backs of the plates.     When the
distance was O'O/L7 in., the discharge began to pass between the backs
of the plates when the pressure was reduced to about 2 mm.
   In the later experiments this was prevented by using plates em
bedded in ebonite discs, only leaving exposed the faces between which
the spark was intended to pass, and by making the connexions with
indiarubber covered wires.       Even then, after the plates had been
used for some time, the indiarubber showed signs of giving way, and
a discharge occasionally passed partly between the wires and partly
between    the plates.
   The plates were kept at the right distance apart by placing between
them small <U+FB02>at pieces of ebonite of the same thickness (O'OAN in.).
In the earlier experiments, the plates were in an ordinary bell-jar
standing on a <U+FB02>at surface, the rim being greased with a mixture of
 bee’s-wax and vaseline.    Thinking it possible that there might be
some vapour given o<U+FB01> by the grease, I arranged the apparatus so that
it could be made air-tight without grease. For this purpose used a   I
rather narrow bell-jar, closed at the bottom by an indiarubber stop
per, through which passed three glass tubes for conveying the con
necting wires, and for communicating with the air-pump and the gas
holder.    The jar, with its stopper, was placed in a vessel containing
mercury, so that the junction of the glass and indiarubber was im
>mersed,  the tubes being bent so that their ends came above the
mercury.     The arrangement is shown in the accompanying <U+FB01>gure;

and the spark was not able to pass except between the opposed sur
faces of the plates.

in the same <U+FB01>gures represent the means of the results of several
series of observations with the earlier arrangement of the apparatus,
in which grease was present, and no precautions were taken to
prevent the discharge passing otherwise than between the plates.

These curves are not traced for pressures lower than about 2 mm.
The two curves are nearly identical in the case of pure nitrogen;
in the other cases, with one exception, that of N:H=2:1, the
discharge seems to pass more easily when grease is present.
   It will be noticed that at fairly high pressures the E.M.F. required
to produce a spark diminishes nearly uniformly as the pressure
diminishes, but that there exists for each mixture a critical pressure
at which the E.M.F. is a minimum, and that as the pressure dimin
ishes from the critical value the E.M.F. continually increases. When
the pressure is slightly less than the critical pressure the E.M.F.
increases with remarkable rapidity as the pressure diminishes. In
fact, as the pressure falls by about % mm. the E.M.F. may increase
by several hundred volts.
   The critical pressure diminishes as the proportion of nitrogen to

hydrogen is increased. With spark length 0047 in. it varies from
about 11 mm. in pure hydrogen to about 5 mm. in pure nitrogen.
   At high pressures the          required to produce a discharge at a
given pressure diminishes continually as the proportion of hydrogen
to nitrogen is increased.   At low pressures the relation between the
composition  of the mixture  and the E.M.F. required to produce a spark
at a given pressure is less simple. It is represented by the curves
in <U+FB01>g. 8, where the ordinates give the E.M.F. in volts, and the ratio
in which the ordinate divides the line NH is equal to the ratio of the
volumes of nitrogen and hydrogen in the mixture.

    The asymmetrical probability curve is the second approximation—
the symmetrical probability curve being the <U+FB01>rst approximation—t0
the law of frequency which governs the set of values assumed by a
function of. numerous independently <U+FB02>uctuating small quantities.

where yAa: is the number of errors occurring between a: and art-Aw,
r-z/2 is the mean square of errors, and           is the mean cube of errors——
errors measured from the centre of gravity.               This form is obtained
by completing       the   analysis    which    Todhunter, after Poisson, has
indicated (‘ History of Probabilities,’ Art. 1002) ; and independently
by obtaining a general form for the asymmetric probability curve,
and deducing therefrom the Poissonian formula in the case when the
asymmetry is slight—the only case to which that formula is applic
                                            i
able.
    Among the peculiarities of' the asymmetric probability curve are
the want of coincidence between the arithmetic mean and the position
of the greatest ordinate, and the descent of the curve at one ex
tremity below the abscissa—the ordinate appearing to denote negative
probability.
    An important case of the general curve is afforded by the Binomial,
 for which each of the independent elements admits of only two values.
 The approximate form of the Binomial, obtained directly by Laplace
                 ‘
 (Todhunter,       History,’ Art. 993), is deducible from the general
 theory. The general, or multinomial, probability curve can always be
 represented by a binomial.

   The object of the earlier parts of this paper is to obtain relations
connecting what Halphen* calls the canonical invariants of the curve,
without the intervention of what are called by him the fundamental
invariants.    In any geometrical investigation it is the canonical in
variants which present themselves, and the relations between the con
secutive canonical invariants, and the values of their differential
coe<U+FB02>icients must, if the method of investigation is to be used, be
expressed, in terms of canonical invariants only, without the inter
vention of the other series of invariants which Halphen treats as
fundamental.
   In the paper, the notation of Halphen’s paper cited above is gener
ally followed, but the mode of initial investigation, as in a previous
paper on covariants of plane curvesd' is made to depend upon a
homographic transfermation with in<U+FB01>nitesimal arguments.

    The general result is that there may be as many forms of solution
as there are variables (the differential equations being of the <U+FB01>rst
order, to which they may always be reduced).               Each form is derived
from the one before by the process .of <U+FB01>nding the envelope, and each
contains fewer arbitrary constants by one than the form from which
it is directly derived.
    The general theory is given in § 2 for the case when the differential
coe<U+FB01>icients are given explicitly in terms of the variables.               In § 3 it
is extended to the case when they are given implicitly, and in § 4 it
is shown how the singular solutions are to be formed from the differen
tial equations themselves. In              5—9 the theory is connected with
that of consecutive solutions belonging to the complete primitive.
 §§ 10—13 are taken up with geometrical interpretations relating to
plane curves, and also to curves' in space of n+1 dimensions, n+1
being the number of variables. In §§ 14—16 the case is discussed in
which a system of singular solutions is included in a former system or
in the complete primitive.
    The rest of the paper contains the application of the theory to
 certain examples. The <U+FB01>rst example                17—21) is the case of the
 “ lines in two                          of   twisted   curve, and in particular
                 osculating planes”         a
of a twisted cubic. The particular example is given by Mayer and
 Serret. The second            22—26) is that of the congruency of common
 tangents to two quadric surfaces, and generally                   27—38) of the
 bitangents to any surface. The third              39—49)is     that  of the essen
 tially different kind of congruency which consists of the in<U+FB02>exional
 tangents to a. surface. It seems natural to call these two kinds of
 congruency bitangential and in<U+FB02>ewional respectively.              The fourth ex
 ample        50—52)    is that  of a  system   of  conics   touching   six planes.
 The <U+FB01>fth        53—60)     is that  of  a doubly  in<U+FB01>nite    system   of parabolas
 in one plane, the differential equation being a case of an extension of

           The Spectrum Changes in 18 Lyrte.                Preliminary Note.”

     The spectrum of this well known variable star was <U+FB01>rst investi
 gated photographically by Professor Pickering, at Harvard College
 Observatory, and a preliminary account of the results was published
 in 1891.ale   Dark and bright lines were found to be associated in the
 spectrum, and further, the bright lines were found to change their
 positions with respect to the corresponding dark ones according to
 the interval of time which had elapsed since the preceding minimum.

    It may be remarked that the period of the light-changes of the
star is about twelve days twenty-two hours, and there are two
approximately equal maxima of mag. 3‘4, a principal minimum of
mag. 4'5, and a secondary minimum of 3'9, the period of variation
stated being that which elapses between two successive principal
minima.
    Professor Pickering found that during the <U+FB01>rst half of the
period—that is, between principal and secondary minima—the bright
lines were on the less refrangible sides of the corresponding dark
ones, while during the second half they were displaced to the more
refrangible sides.         He further remarked that “ the actual changes in
the spectra, when studied in detail, are much more complicated than
has been stated above, and show a variety of intermediate phases
and changes in the dark as well as in the bright lines.”
                                                  I
    At Professor Pickering’s request, took up the work at Kensing
ton in July, 1891, the instrument employed being the 6-inch Henry
object glass and prism of 7%: which                 I have described in a previous
communication.ale          Several photographs were taken with this instru
 ment, but it was not until the new 6-inch prism of 45°1- was employed
in the research that any considerable advance was made. With the
 higher dispersion of this instrument the spectrum is depicted in
greater detail, and more minute changes can therefore be deter
mined.
    Since my work was commenced, accounts of the photographic
spectrum of ,6 Lyrse have been published by Belopolskyj Father
 Sidgreaves,§ and Vogel," and various suggestions have been made by
 them and others as to the conditions which bring about the varia
 bility.
    On this account, although the reductions of the sixty-four photo
 graphs which     I  have obtained are not yet completed,            I have thought
 it desirable to give a brief resume of the facts already acquired.
     For the complete study of the problem more photographs will be
 required, and a considerable amount of time will be required for the
 discussion of them. The present cemmunication, therefore, is limited
 to a preliminary consideration of the variation in the spectrum as
 photographed at Kensington, and              I  have consequently in it omitted
 reference to the results obtained by other workers.                     In a subse
 quent paper, however, a complete history of the subject will be
 given.

   roughly one for each day of the period—are given in Plate 1. These
   have been enlarged about three times from the original negatives.*
       As it is a matter of great dif<U+FB01>culty to mount a series of such photo
   graphs showing the exact coincidences of the lines, in comparing the
   different spectra in the plates some allowance must be made for the
   slight differences in scale. Further, it is right to add that probably
   some of the fainter lines shown in the photographs are arti<U+FB01>cially
   produced by the process of enlargement, but the real lines will be
   readily identi<U+FB01>ed by their appearance in more than one spectrum; the
   lines of particular interest are indicated in Plate 2 (p. 283).
      The light curve which forms part of Plate 1 is constructed after
  Argelander’s drawingd' and the dotted lines drawn from the spectra
  to the period scale indicate the relation of each photograph to the
  light curve.
      I  proceed      to state, step by step, the results of the preliminary
  examination of the photographs, and to indicate the spectral pheno
  mena on which they are based.
      1. The spectrum is constant at the same interval from principal
  minimum.
      Apart from the slight di<U+FB02>erences which seem to be accounted for
  by differences in the atmospheric conditions and consequently in the
  quality of the negatives, the spectrum appears to be the same at the
  same interval from minimum.                 The photographs reproduced in
  Plate 1 have been selected as being specially suitable for reproduc
  tion, but at most of the phases duplicates which are practically iden
  tical have been obtained.
      2. The kinds of variation shown on the photographs are as follows :—
         (a.) Periodical changes in the relative intensities of the lines.
         (1).) Periodical doublings of some of the dark lines.
         (0.) Periodical changes in the positions of the bright lines with
               respect to the dark ones.
      3. There are two bodies involved giving dark line spectra.
      On reference to Plate 1 it will be seen that at, and just before and
  after the second maximum, some of the dark lines are doubled. This
  indicates two sources of light giving dark line spectra and moving
  relatively to each other in the direction of the line of sight.                  When
  the relative movement in the line of sight is zero, none of the lines
  are doubled.         The latter condition occurs about the time of the two
_ minima.
      4. The mawimum relative velocity of the two dark line components in
  the line of sight is about 156 miles per second.
     * This plate is not given in the “ Proceedings," as it is very dif<U+FB01>cult to reproduce
  it on so small a scale.

  1894.]               The Spectrum          Changes    in  18 Lyme.              281
    The greatest separation of the dark lines occurs about the time of
 second    maximum, and the relative velocity, as determined by
 measurements of three of the doubles in the photograph of August
 24, 1893, is that stated above.              The individual measurements are as
 follows :—
                             Hq = 155 miles per second.
                            H5 =      154.           ,,
                        i4025 =       158            ,,
    5. One of the dark line components bears a strong resemblance to Rigel
 and the other to Bellatrt'x.
    The spectra of the two components can readily be separated, for
 the reason that only lines common to both will be doubled.                    Among
 these are the lines of hydrogen.              Lines special to either component
 are always single, and they retain the same relative positions with
 respect to one group of hydrogen lines throughout the period.
    In Plate 2 photographs are given to facilitate an analysis of the
 compound dark line spectrum. At the bottom of the diagram is a
reproduction of a photograph taken near the time of second maximum
 (August 24, 1893), and the spectra of Rigel and Bellatrix are in
cluded in the same plate. The compound character of the dark line
 spectrum of B Lyraa at this time is shown by the fact that one group
of lines corresponds very closely with those which appear in the
 spectrum of Rigel, and when these are subtracted from the whole
 spectrum, a spectrum closely resembling that of Bellatrix remains;
the. latter spectrum being displaced in this photograph to
                                                                             the more
refrangible     side,    as  shown      by   the  short    lines  drawn   beneath the
spectrum.      The     resemblance        of  the  two    components    to  Rigel and
Bellatrix respectively, the spectra of which                   I have described in a
previous paper,* is further shown by the following tabular com

B respectively (p. 282).
   It  is not intended to suggest that the spectra of the two dark line
components are quite identical with those of Rigel and Bellatrix.
These are simply the best known stars which they most closely re
semble, and the similarity is pointed out as an indication that we
have not to deal with bodies of an unfamiliar type. Throughout the
         I
paper shall refer to the two components as R and B respectively.
   The conditions at <U+FB01>rst maximum, as shown in Plate 1, are not so
simple as those at second maximum, though there is evidence to
show that at this point of the light curve the component B is reced
ing with respect to R. As will be seen on reference to the photo
graph of March 13, 18941, the hydrogen lines are broadened, and the

  the spectrum of ,8 Lyraa greatly resembles that of Bellatrix, the com
  ponent B in this case lying between us and component B. As the
  eclipse is not total, however, the lines special to R appear with
  reduced intensities; the lines joining the spectrum of [8 Lyraa to that
  of Bellatrix indicate the principal lines of component B. At the
  secondary minimum, on the other hand, component R lies in front of
  component B, and the spectrum consequently bears a greater resem
  blance to that of Rigel.     This is shown by the lines joining those of
  [3 Lyraa to the spectrum of Rigel in Plate 2.
     The diiference is especially noticeable in the case of the lines near
  x4471, 4481, 4388, and in the group of four lines a little less refran
  gible than 114;. It will be seen that near principal minimum 4471 is
  stronger than 4481, as in Bellatrix, while about secondary minimum
  4481 is stronger than 4471.
     If the eclipses were total, the variations of the spectrum might be
  expected to be still more striking.

  their positions with respect to the dark ones.

     The photographs show conspicuous bright lines about wave-lengths
  4862(Hs),     4715, 4471, 4388,        4340(Hy),    4101 (H5), 4025,     and
  3887(Hg).      Other fainter ones also appear in some of the best photo
  graphs. The line at 4471 (Lorenzoni’s          f)  is the well-known line
  which appears in the spectrum of the solar chromosphere, and those
  at 4025 and 4715 are amongst the brightest lines photographed with
  the prismatic camera during the total eclipse of the sun on April 16,
   1893.
     The displacements of the bright lines described by Pickering are
  con<U+FB01>rmed in the main by the Kensington photographs.              In the <U+FB01>rst
  seven photographs in Plate 1 taken between principal and secondary
  minimum, the bright lines lie on the less refrangible sides of the dark
  ones, at secondary minimum           the broad bright lines are almost
  bisected by dark ones ; while from secondary minimum to prin
. cipal minimum the bright lines are more refrangible than the dark
  ones. The investigation of the movements of the bright lines must,
  however, be now carried on in the light of the knowledge gained
  with regard to the existence of two sets of dark lines.
     If we consider the displacements of the bright lines with reference
  to the dark lines of component R, we <U+FB01>nd that they are always in the
  same direction as those of component B with respect to R.            Thus in
  the <U+FB01>rst half of the period, the bright lines, as well as the dark lines
  of component B, are less refrangible than those of component R, while
  during the second half they are more refrangible.          The bright lines,
  however, do not keep a constant position with respect to those of
  component B, although displaced in the same direction.

  If  the brightness of the lines in reality remains constant, they will
appear relatively brightest at the two minima, owing to the reduction
of continuous spectrum which is associated with the increased bright
ness of the star at maximum, and for the same reason they should
appear brighter at principal than at secondary minimum.       Estimates
of the brightness of the lines in relation to the continuous spectrum
have been made independently by four of my assistants, and, although
estimates of this kind are liable to error, the general agreement is
su<U+FB02>icient to indicate that when all allowance is made for the varying
continuous spectrum, there is a maximum of brightness of the bright
lines about half a day after secondary minimum.          The apparent
increase of brightness near principal minimum seems to be due
solely to the reduced intensity of the continuous spectrum.
  I have to express my obligations to Messrs. Fowler, Baxandall,
Shackleton, Butler, Wardale, Crabtree, and North, who, at different
times, have assisted in taking the photographs.

       Orion.” By J. NORMAN LOCKYER, C.B., F.R.S. Received
       June   13, 1894.
                                     (Abstract)
   The paper consists of a description and discussion of photographs
of the spectrum of the Orion Nebula, taken with the 30-inch re<U+FB02>ector
at Westgate-on-Sea in February, 1890, of which a preliminary
account was communicated to the Royal Society at the time. Fifty
four lines are tabulated as belonging to the spectrum of the nebula,
nine of them being due to hydrogen.     Tables are given showing :—
  1. The wave-lengths, intensities, and probable origins of the lines
       photographed in the spectrum of the nebula.
  2. A comparison of the lines in the spectrum of the nebula with
       lines in the spectra of (a) P. Cygni, (b) bright line stars
        and planetary nebulae, and (0) stars in Groups II, III,
        and IV, of the classi<U+FB01>cation according to the meteoritic
       hypothesis.
   The complete discussion has led to the following general con
clusions:—
   l. The spectrum of the nebula of Orion is a compound one con
sisting of hydrogen lines, low temperature metallic lines and <U+FB01>utings,
and high temperature lines.      The mean temperature, however, is
relatively low.*

   2. The spectrum is diiferent    in di<U+FB01>erent parts of   the nebula.

planetary nebulae and bright line stars.

      Chemistry in the Owens College. Communicated by Pro
      fessor H. DIXON, F.R.S. Received April 7, 1894.
                                 (Abstract)
   The measurements recorded in the paper were made in the hope of
obtaining some information as to the molecular condition of salts in
dilute solution.
   In order to obtain exact quantitative results it is necessary to
measure the extinction coef<U+FB01>cients of the solutions.        For this purpose
a new spectrophotometer was devised, by means of which it was
possible to work with very dilute solutions.       In this instrument, by
the advice of Professor A. Schuster, F.R.S., a Lummer and Brodhun
photometric prism was used, and the photometric measurements were
made by means of Abney’s rotating sector.
   The absorption spectra of solutions of cupric sulphate, chloride
bromide and nitrate, containing generally 0003 to O'OOQ gr. mol.
per litre, were measured and found to be, within the limits of experi
mental error, identical. The solutions of cupric acetate absorb, for
the same amount of copper, much more light than those of the other
salts used.   The di<U+FB01>erence tends to disappear as the solutions become
more dilute, and it is increased by the addition of acetic acid. These
facts point to the conclusion that the difference is due to the incom
plete electrolytic dissociation of the salt, and to the undissociated
part having an absorption spectrum di<U+FB01>ering‘ from that of the dis
sociated part.                                          ,
   Dilute solutions of the  potassium    and  ammonium salts of a-dinitr<U+FB01>

tion spectrum. The mean of the numbers obtained for these two
salts was regarded as the absorption spectrum of the ion CQH3(NOZ)20.
The solution of dinitrophenol in hydrochloric acid (containing the
undissociated molecule CaHa(N02)20H) absorbs very little light; it is
almost colourless.    The extinction coef<U+FB01>cients of dinitrophenol, and
of its coloured ion, being thus known, it was possible to calculate
from measurement of the extinction coe<U+FB02>icients of a series of solutions
of dinitrophenol in pure water, its degree of dissociation in these
solutions.    The numbers thus obtained were in very satisfactory
agreement with the numbers calculated from the electrical conducti
vity of the solutions.
   As an example of the hydrolytic decomposition of a salt in aqueous
solution, to the study of which the spectro-photometric method can
be advantageously applied, ferric chloride was taken.
   By <U+FB01>ltering dilute solutions of ferric chloride through a porous cell
all the colloid ferric hydroxide formed can be removed; and analyses
of the solutions before and after <U+FB01>ltration showed that the hydroxide
formed in solutions containing less than 0005 gram molecule of
FeCla per litre contains no chlorine. The decomposition which occurs
in these solutions may thus be most simply expressed by the equation
FeCla+ 3H201Fe(OH)S+ 31101.
   The photometric determinations of the quantity of ferric hydroxide
formed in these solutions agreed fairly well with the results of the
<U+FB01>ltration experiments, though, owing to the dif<U+FB01>culty in obtaining
the solutions of ferric chloride perfectly clear, they were not so
satisfactory as could be desired.
   The quantities of ferric hydroxide formed Were not in agreement
with the law of Guldberg and Wage, but agreed much better with
the modi<U+FB01>ed form of the law due to Arrhenius, in which the electro
lytic dissociation of the different substances is taken into account.
   It was observed that solutions of ferric hydroxide obtained by
dissolving ferric chloride in a very large quantity of water, had a
di<U+FB01>'erent absorption spectrum from that of solutions of ferric hydroxide
obtained by dialysis. It is suggested that an explanation of this fact
may be found in the differences in the complexity of the molecular
aggregates existing in the different solutions.
   Finally, solutions of ferric chloride, to which small quantities of
hydrochloric acid had been added, possess such comparatively small
power of absorbing light that they cannot be regarded as containing
any colloid hydroxide of iron.

         the Gomphodontia."        By H. G. SEELEY, F.R.S. Received
         June   21, 1894.
                                   (Abstract)
      The Gomphodontia is a group of Anomodont reptiles characterised
   by theriodont dentition, in which the molar teeth are. expanded trans
   versely, more or less tuberculate, and have the crowns worn down
   with use, as in ungulate and other mammals. The orbit of the eye
   is distinct from the zygomatic vacuity, which is conditioned as in the
   Cynodontia, there being a long narrow parietal crest dividing. the
   temporal vacuities. There are two well-de<U+FB01>ned occipital condyles
   united at the base, in a way that is closely paralleled in some
   mammals. The occipital plate is triangular, as in mammals, with no
   perforation except the foramen magnum. A deep superior notch
   de<U+FB01>nes the occipital plate from the lateral external squamosal bar.
   The malar bone, which forms the larger part of the zygoma, behind
   the orbit, has a slight descending process which varies in develop
   ment. The hard palate terminates transversely in the middle length
   of the molar teeth.     There is a descending transverse palatine arch
   situate behind the orbits. The incisor teeth are small and pointed;
   the canine teeth may be inconspicuous, but are usually large, com
   pressed, and serrated; the premolars are small, circular, and usually
-  tuberculate; the molars are usually single-rooted, in close-set series
   which diverge as they extend backward, with crowns which vary in
   form, but are commonly wider than long, and usually have the
   external and internal cusps more prominent than the other tubercles
   on the crown.
      The group is based chie<U+FB02>y upon the genera Gomphognathus, known
   from skulls, a vertebra, and fragments of limb bones; Tr'irachodon,
  known from skulls only; and hlicrogomphodon, in which the canine
   teeth are no larger than the incisors. The last genus appears to
   make known the more important parts of the skeleton.
      These specimens, collected by the author at Lady Frere, by Dr.
  Kannemeyer, near Burghersdorp, and by Mr. Alfred Brown, near
  Aliwal North, are all from the Upper Karroo rocks, on or about the
  horizon of the Coal Beds.
      Of Gomphognathus there is a complete skull, with the lower jaw
  attached, about 9 ins. long, a second skull which displays the palate,
  and a separate lower jaw in connexion with part of the back of the
  skull.    These specimens show four incisor teeth in each premaxillary
  bone, with sharp lateral serrated borders.       The mandibular canine
  is covered when the jaws are closed.         The maxillary canine is a

   1894.]     Organisation,  and Classi<U+FB01>cation  of Fossil Reptilia.    28
  powerful tooth: its extremity is worn obliquely.        There appear to
  be six premolar teeth, all contained in a length of half an inch.    The
  maxillary teeth are packed in close succession, as in Rodents. There
  are nine molar teeth.     In the middle, where they are largest, four
  occupy the length of 1 in. The contour of the crowns of these
  molars is convex from front to back, as in many mammals; and in
  this genus they are all behind the hard palate. The external cusp is
  prominent, and a ridge descends inward and backward from it upon
  the large <U+FB02>attened ledge of the crown, which is worn almost level, as
 though there were a rodent-like horizontal movement of the lower
 Jaw.
    A lumbar vertebra, found in deve10ping the back of a skull, may
 possibly belong to this genus.
    With the skulls a right humerus was found, which is 5% ins. long.
 It shows the reptilian transverse elongation of the proximal articula
 tion, combined with characters which are paralleled in the marsupial
 mammals and Carnivora.
     The genus Microgomphodon is known in the <U+FB01>rst place from a skull
 2% ins. long, shaped much as in Galesam-ns, but distinguished      by the
 comparatively large size of the front pair of mandibular incisors,
 and the strong, conical, pointed character of the incisor teeth. The
 canine teeth are not diiferentiated from the incisors.       The molars
 show in lateral aspect small blunt cones ; but on their palatal aspect
 have <U+FB02>attened crowns with many small cusps.          All the teeth have
 short roots.    There are three incisors on each side in both the man
 dible and skull, one canine, and <U+FB01>ve molars.
    There is ground for associating with this genus an imperfect
 skeleton, which, in addition to indicating ten early dorsal ribs, and
 fourteen lower dorsal vertebrae and ribs in advance of the acet
 abulum of the femur, shows the left humerus, portions of right and
 left scapular, portions of the coracoid, clavicle, interclavicle, the
 pelvic bones, all the bones of the hind limb, distal ends of ulna and
 radius, carpus, metacarpus, and <U+FB01>ve digits. With these a fragment
 of a skull is associated, which has the maxillary and mandibular
 teeth in contact, showing the animal to be Gomphodont; while so
 much as is preserved closely resembles the skull of illiorogomphodon,
 and apparently the canine was not larger than the premolar. This
 skeleton demonstrates a close general resemblance of plan between
the Gomphodontia and Cynodontia.           The lower dorsal ribs have a
transverse lozenge-shaped      enlargement, which, however, is less de
veloped than in Gynognathns.        The pelvis is exposed on the ventral
side.    As in most, if not all, South African Therosuchia, it shows no
indication of median division between the pubic bones, while the
ischia retain their individuality.

  the  ilium is thin, but imperfectly exposed ; and   the ischia are shaped
 as   in Pliosaurus, but the pubis does not closely    resemble that of any
 reptile.     The femur has the inferior internal trochanteric ridge only
  slightly developed.    There is no neck de<U+FB01>ning the head of the bone
 from the shaft.      The <U+FB01>bula is slender; no indication of a patella is
 preserved.      Below the stout tibia, the proximal row of the tarsus
  appears to consist of two bones, an inner astragalus with hemis
 pherical proximal surface, and a narrow elongated              bone which
  appears to be the calcaneum.      There were three or four bones in the
  distal row of the tarsus, but only one is preserved.      The digits are
  nearly parallel with each other, and the foot has a compact character
 like that of _Dicynodon.
      The scapulae have the pro-scapula developed on the same plan as in
  Cynognathus, and the anterior margin of the bone re<U+FB02>ected upward,
'so as to form the spine of the scapula, terminating in the acromion.
 The two ends of the humerus are twisted at an angle of 45 degrees,
 and the bone is expanded as in many Saurischian reptiles.              The
 carpus shows three bones in the proximal row, a large reniform
 carpal below the ulna, regarded as the pisiform bone; a compara
 tively small middle carpal is identi<U+FB01>ed as the cuneiform bone.         The
 third bone corresponds with the scapho-lunar of Them'oelesmus; it is
 beneath the radius.     There is no indication of any pre-pollex. There
 are four bones in the distal row of the carpus.      There are <U+FB01>ve digits.
     In the pelvis and the limb bones this Anomodont type approxi
 mates to the Saurischia and Mammalia, just as the Ornithischia
 approximate to birds in the same parts of the skeleton.
     Tri'rachodon is founded on four individuals which have the skull
 about 4! ins. long. Like the other Gomphodont genera, this type has
 the dentary bone developed so as to occupy the length of the
 mandible, but the lower jaw is composite, the internal bones <U+FB01>lling
 the space which in mammals is occupied by the meckelian cartilage.
 The post-frontal and pre-frontal bones are well developed.             The
 species differ in the character of the teeth, especially in number and
 form of the pre-molars.
     In one species from Aliwal North, the molar teeth are transversely
 wide, ornamented with three transverse ridges, which terminate in a
 slight cusp, both 011 the external and internal margins. There are
 not more than nine molars. The crown of the <U+FB01>rst pre-molar in one
 specimen is elongated from front to back, and shows a small coronet
of rounded marginal cusps.       In a species from Lady Frere the molar
teeth are     narrower, and  the  pre-molar teeth more numerous, small,
and circular in the broken sections.
    Although these Skulls are mammalian in aspect, and in some
respects      make new transitions towards mammals, in technical
characters they retain a suf<U+FB01>cient number of reptilian structures to

   skeleton, it may   be af<U+FB01>rmed that these fossils demonstrate a closer
   af<U+FB01>nity between     reptiles and mammals than had previously been
   evident.

                                   (Abstract)
     The Cynodontia is a division of the Theriodontia in which there
  are long and large temporal vacuities     in the skull, formed chie<U+FB02>y by
  the squamosal and malar bones; in which there is no descending
  pedicle to the squamosal bone; in which the occipital condyle is
  crescentic and‘imperfectly divided into two lateral parts; and in
  which the hinder molar teeth, larger than the incisor teeth, develop
 anterior and posterior cusps, are compressed from side to side, and
 overlap, with shearlike action, the teeth of the mandible. The prin
 cipal new genera included in this group are Oynognathus, which is
 known from several skulls, and one fairly complete skeleton; and
 the genus Tribolodon, which does not differ in a striking way from
 the small Cynodonts previously known, referred to the genera
 Galesaurus, Nythosaurus, and Thm'nawodon.
     The skeleton of Gynognathus’cmteronotus was found at Lady Frere,
 near Queenstown.       A single tooth of this genus had already been ob
 tained by Mr. Alfred Brown at Aliwal North.           The skull is between
 15 and 16 in. long, 8 in. high at the orbits, and higher at the occiput,
 where it was about 9 in. wide.          The lateral aspect is remarkably
 Mammalian, owing to the great development of the dentary bone,
which forms a new type of lower jaw, and has a greatly develop’ed
coronoid process, and the form of the zygoma.            On the palate, the
palatine    and  transverse   bones  form  a  descending   arch between the
rami of the mandible, as in Crocodiles, Sphenodon and Lizards.            The
composite structure of the lower jaw is seen on its inner side.           The
pre-frontal and post-frontal bones remain distinct.         There is a. small
quadrate bone embedded in the large squamosal bone.              The latter
resembles that of Mammals, both in its, extension along the zygoma,
and its expansion as a squamous plate on the side of the brain case.
    There are four incisors in each pre-maxillary; their margins are
serrated. There appear to be but three mandibular incisors on each
side, so that the type resembles Oynochampsa, but there is no evidence
                                                                 U 2

292     Prof. H. G. Seeley.      Researches  on the Structure,   [June 21,
of close af<U+FB01>nity with that genus.      The canine teeth are large, worn on
the anterior border, and serrated on the hinder margin.        Remnants of
canine teeth are indicated which haVe been replaced by those which
persist. There are nine molar teeth, of which the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>ve are smaller
than the posterior teeth. Those teeth are more than half as wide again,
from front to back, as the anterior teeth.      The hinder teeth have the
principal cusp directed backward, with one subordinate pointed cusp
on the front margin, and two subordinate cusps on the hinder margin.
The crownsof the teeth stand high above the alveolar margin in this
species.    They are intermediate in form of crown between. Cam's and
Zeuglodon.
   The nares are terminal, divided, lateral, and arch forward in front
of the alveolar margin. The orbit of the. eye is 8 in. behind the
extremity of the snout, nearly circular, and separated from the tem—
poral vacuity by the post-frontal bone.       The post-frontal bones con
verge backward along the parietal crest.        The malar bone develops a
slight descending process on its inferior margin. There is no inter
orbital septum ossi<U+FB01>ed.       The type species of Gynognathus shows, on
the one side preserved, a small post-orbital foramen, comparable to
that of Procolophor, and the author considers that the enlargement of
this foramen makes an essential difference in plan between the skulls
of Teleosaurs and Theriodonts, and regards the Mammalian zygoma
as resulting from the obliteration of the post-orbital vacuity which
de<U+FB01>nes the superior and inferior temporal arcades in Saurischia and.
other Reptilia.
   In general structure of palate Oynognathus resembles Lyeosaurus.
There is no transverse boundary to the hard palate, but the palato
nares are lanceolate. The author <U+FB01>nds that the downward develop
ment of the bones of the palate at the posterior borders of the nares,
while thoroughly reptilian, approximates to the condition in Mam
mals.
   The form of the lower jaw approximates to that of the older
Mammals and lower Mammalian types, leading to the conclusion
that the Mammalian lower jaw consists essentially of the dentary
bone.     The dentary bone is compared to that of Microcomdon in
form, and development of the angle of the jaw.
   The shoulder girdle consists of a large scapula, small coracoid, and
compressed pre-coracoid.       The scapula demonstrates the origin of a
spine  like  that of the  scapula   in Mammals, by outward development
of the   anterior  border  of the scapula in Reptiles.    This spine is de
<U+FB01>ned by a pre-scapula development anteriorly.         The spine may have
been originally a separate ossi<U+FB01>cation, such as in Pareiasaurus has
been named epi-clavicle.        It terminates in an acromion which is re
<U+FB02>ected forward.
   The humerus is imperfectly preserved, but has the distal con

dyles well developed; and the proximal crest has a form which is
seen in Marsupials, but the articular head is transverse.
    The vertebral column measures 37 ins. from the body of the
atlas to the last lumbar vertebra; and its total length is 45 ins., but
the extremity of the tail is lost. There appear to be only six cervicals
de<U+FB01>ned by the form and direction of the transverse processes for the
tubercles of the ribs. The head of the rib is attached to the inter
central suture, and in the <U+FB01>rst vertebra reaches the intercentrum.
There are 29 presacral vetebrae, of which 18 may be counted as dorsal
and 5 as lumbar.        The most distinctive feature of the vertebral
column is the interlocking of the ribs in the lower dorsal and lumbar
region, where the ribs become transversely expanded, and anchylosed
to the side of the centrum. The neural arch in the lumbar region also
interlocks, by an arrangement resembling the zygosphene and
zygantrum of Serpents. N0 dorsal rib is completely preserved.
    The sacrum is small; and the sacral ribs are smaller than the
lumbar ribs. They are four in number. The middle two vertebra) are
anchylosed. The caudal vertebrae are short, only four are preserved.
They indicate a considerable movement. There is no evidence of
dermal armour. The characters of the vertebral column described by
Professor Cope, in Dimetrodon and allied genera, closely resemble
 Cynognathus.
    The pelvis consists of three bones; the ilium forms an expanded
plate more resembling Megalosaums than Dicy-nodon.           There is a
large longitudinal obturator foramen, between the pubis and the
ischium.     The anterior transverse border of the pubis is cartilagi
nous, and there is no evidence of pre-pubic bones.       The ischium is
larger than the pubis. The author compares the anomodont pelvis
with that of Plesiosauria, although Pliosaurus, in the form of the
ilium, more closely approaches Dicynodon than Cynogna<U+FB02>ms.
    The femur is imperfectly preserved. It was characterised,    as in all
Theriodonts known to the author, by the development of an immense
inferior plate or ridge at the proximal end, which distinguishes it
from allied animals. In this specimen the ridge is broken away.
The head of the bone is greatly expanded transversely ; and the distal
end is not preserved.
    Under the name Oynognathus Berryi the author describes imperfect
evidence of a smaller skull of C'ynognathus, which is distinguished
from O'. cratemotus with some doubt; but if distinct it is de<U+FB01>ned by
the relatively large size of the middle mandibular incisor, the apparent
presence of ten molars, in all of which the crowns overlap each other,
and the roots are barely shown at the alveolar border. In the small
species the cutting margin and the cusps of the posterior teeth are
better de<U+FB01>ned.
    If the species are identical the teeth have probably yet to be re

   placed by a successional series, but no known specimen of any genus
   shows such replacement.
      The skull of Uynognathus platyceps was obtained by Dr. Kannemeyr
   at Wonderboom.        It is a small species distinct from Gynognathus
   crateronotus.   The skull has lost the extremity of the snout.    It is
   remarkable for its depression.      The teeth, however, are similar to
   those of the larger species; they have <U+FB01>ve denticles.    The composite
   structure of the lower jaw is well shown, and the dentary bone be
   hind the angle of the jaw retreats so as to expose the elements which
   form the articulation.
      The occipital plate of a large Theriodont skull from Lady Frere is
   described, which shows a circular foramen magnum, and the perfectly
   preserved occipital condyles which are not quite so completely
  separated as in Mammals, having only a median groove between them
  on the ventral surface.
      Another fragment of a skull preserved in the Albany Museum has
  only the pre-orbital portion preserved, and is remarkable for the
  small size of its incisor teeth, widely separated from each other, and
  for having two canine teeth parallel to each other. On both sides the
  crowns are imperfectly preserved.      The molar teeth are on the type
  of Oynognathus, with a principal cusp <U+FB02>anked back and front by a
  small cusp, with a smaller accessory posterior cusp in the four
  hindermost teeth.      As in all species of the genus the mandibular
  symphysis is long, oblique, and completely obliterated.      There is a
, large pit with sharp margin, in the median line in front of the orbits,
  which may be a generic difference from Cynognathus, since it occurs in
  the area in which other specimens show indications of a thin supra
  nasal ossi<U+FB01>cation <U+FB02>anked by a pair of small hemispherical concavities.
  It is indicated as O. leptorhinus.
     Tribolodon Frerensis is the name given to a dentary bone with few
  three-pronged teeth widely separated from each other standing high
  above the jaw.    With this jaw is associated a femur which shows the
  transverse development of the great trochanter as strongly developed
  at the proximal end of the bone as in Ichthyosau'rus, so that the
  trochanter minor of Mammals only represents that of Theriodonts in
  miniature, the trochanter being more developed than in Saurischia or
  any other reptiles. With it is associated a right tibia which is some
  what curved and nearly as long as the femur.
     These Cynodont remains have given no certain evidence of the ex
  tremities of the limbs; but with this exception .they make known the
  entire skeleton for the <U+FB01>rst time in an African Theriodont, furnishing
  data for comparison with Mammals and Reptiles in every part of the
  skeleton preserved.

   The author obtained parts of two skeletons from the summit of the
Karroo rocks, which form the Nieuwveldt range. They resemble
Theriodonts in their general marsupial characters.         The fragments of
skulls are not in the same slabs with the other bones.
   Theromus leptonotns shows the fore-limb and some vertebrae.          The
humerus is determined to be Theriodont by the transverse extension
of the proximal articulation.            The bone is' lf‘6 inches long,
resembling in form that of the Phalangers.             The cut-episondylar
foramen is more      vertical    than  in  the  marsupials; and, as among
marsupials, the radial crest if prolonged distally would be continuous
with the bridge over that foramen. The vertebrae are each % inch
long; they show a transverse suture between the neural arch and the
centrum.
   The anterior part of the skull, very imperfectly preserved, indi
cates three incisor teeth with the root of a relatively large maxil
lary canine, but the region of the molar teeth is lost. There is also
a posterior fragment of a skull, which makes known the bones of
the palate and the base of the brain case seen from above.           Enough
is shown to indicate Theriodont characters, but the animal appears to
diverge from the Theriodonts towards the Dicynodont type. If the
base of the skull belongs to the same individual as the snout, it indi
cates a head nearly 41% inches long.
   The second specimen shows 14: dorsal vertebrm, which occupy a
length of 51- inches; each slightly exceeds 116 inch in length, so that
this animal named Herpetocheirus brachycnemns, is similar in size to
the fossil previously described.
   The centrum is deeply biconcave.            There is no indication of a
capitular  articulation    for  the  ribs.   The  ribs are slender, and the
longest are 2% inches     in  length. There is no trace of the transverse
expansion seen in Oynognathus, although the ribs preserved indicate
20 dorsal vertebrae.     The humerus is IT‘E inches long, and is exposed
on the superior aspect.      It is distinguished from the type already de
scribed by wanting      the   tuberosity on its inner distal border, which
has a convexly rounded contour.            The radius is stronger than the
ulna, but there is no indication of an olecranon process exposed. The
ulna is no stouter than a rib. These bones are an inch long. The
carpus shows one large bone below the radius; there is a smaller

bone on its outer side, which corresponds to the distal end of the
ulna, but there is no trace of a third bone preserved, and there is only
one central bone preserved.       There are three phalanges in a digit.
The femur is 17% inches long; its articular head appears to be small
and hemispherical. There is a large internal trochanter extending
down the shaft, which corresponds with the similarly placed ridge
in the femur of Megalosaurs and other Saurischia.
    The slender character of the ribs, which are di<U+FB01>ereut from those in
known Theriodonts, suggests the possibility that these remains belong
to a group distinct from both the Cynodontia and Gomphodontia.
    A small badly preserved fragment of a skull found near to this
fossil is described, but there appears to be no suf<U+FB01>cient evidence for
associating it with the other remains.

          Received June 20, 1894.
                                 (Abstract. )
    Concerning the segmental mesodermal products the following sub
 division is adhered to :—
    The term myotome is to be restricted to the whole rest of the
protovertebra after the skeletogenous cells have been given off for the
 production of the shlerotomes.
     The sum total of the sklerotomes makes up the skeletogenous
 layer.
     The ending tome to indicate the primary, or earlier, less di<U+FB01>eren
 tiated ; the ending mere to signify the <U+FB01>nal condition or product.
     Consequently, the protovertebrae divide into—I, Myotomes, each
 of which produces (1) one myomere or segment of the general mass
  of trunk-muscles, (2) cutis; II, Sklerotomes' which produce sklero
 meres or skeletal trunk segments.
     Each protovertebra produces a dorsal and a ventral sklerotome;
  strictly speaking, one sklerotome which consists of a separate dorsal
  and ventral half,
     The protovertebral segments are not transverse “plates,” but are
  curved into S-shape, the top end curving tail- and inwards, the middle
  and ventral thirds bulging headwards, the amount of curvature being
  (in 7 mm. embryos of Acanthias) so great that a transverse plane
  will cut through the dorsal and ventral third of one, and through the
  middle portion of the next following segment.
     This S-shaped curving and consequent overlapping of the proto

standing of the formation of the vertebral column, because it explains
(1) the so-called new segmentation of the axial column, (2) the
almost universal occurrence of more than one dorsal and one ventral
pair of arcualia (namely, arches and intercalary pieces) in each of the
later vertebral segments or skleromeres.
   The explanation is as follows :—
   1. The dorsal half of sklerotome 2 grows downwards and comes to
lie behind the ventral half of sklerotome 1.
   2. The ventral half of sklerotome 2 grows upwards and comes to
lie in front of and below the dorsal half of sklerotome 3.
   3. The formation of a physiological unit is effected by the combin
ation or fusion of the unequally numbered sklerotomic halves, in such
way that the dorsal half lies behind and above the ventral half.
   The new skleromere      I (= dorsal sklerotome 2+ ventral sklerotome
1)  stands  now  in the  following   relation to the myomeres; the dorsal
end of the skleromere I coincides with myomere I; the septum
betWeen this myomere and the next previous one passes between
dorsal sklerotome 2 and ventral sklerotome ] ; this means to say
right across the new skleromere I. This skleromere lies within the
in<U+FB02>uence or range of action of two successive myomeres.           Taken as a
whole, the skleromere is “interprotovertebral,”           more correctly bi
protovertebral, because it is composed of two successive sklerotomes,
namely, the ventral half of one and the dorsal half of a second.
                           “                   ” or “                  ”
                                                                           is
    Consequently, the        resegmentation              neugliederung
brought about in a manner fundamentally di<U+FB01>ferent to that hitherto
supposed to have taken place.           If A and B mean two successive
sklerotomes, a and 12 their dorsal, a and [3 their respective ventral
halves, then the new skleromere is composed of b+a and not of
                                                                         2
                                 B dorsal      ventral

                                     2           2
   The formation of a skleromere by the combination of alternating
dorsal and ventral halves of sklerotomes explains also the presence of
eight (four pairs) cartilaginous pieces, namely, basalia (so-called
dorsal and ventral arches) and interbasalia (so-called intercalary
pieces) for each complete segment.
   The dorsal and ventral halves of the sklerotomes are pyramidal in
shape, with their apices pointing respectively downwards and up
wards.     Each ventral pyramid extends with its apex above the
chorda, and founds there (separated from the ventral mass by the
subsequent rapid growth of the chorda and its sheath) a cluster of
cells which remains henceforth behind (tailwards from) the basal
mass of the dorsal pyramid.           The latter founds, with its down
growing apex,   a  colony  of  cells below the chorda, and in front of the
basal ventral mass. Thus are produced the basalia and interbasalia,

each colony or cluster of cells developing into a separate piece of car
tilage.  The basidorsal does not fuse with its interdorsal, because
both are the offspring of two different sklerotomes, nor can the basi
dorsal fuse with its own offspring, namely, with the inter-ventral,
because both became, and remain, separated by the chords. and its

of the membrane reuuiens, but not by cartilage-forming cells.

into the chordal sheath    had already been hinted at by Kcelliker more
than thirty years ago ; it has recently been proved by Klaatsch, and
has been corroborated by us.        Chorda-centra are possessed by all
Elasmobranchs, potentially by Dipnoi and Holocephali.
   II. Arch-centre, 'i.e., centra formed by the skeletogenous mass
which remains entirely on the outside of the chordal sheath, which
latter takes no share in their formation: osseous Ganoids and
Teleostei.
   Chorda-centra and arch-centre, represent two different modes of
development, each starting from an acentrous ' condition.      This can
be expressed   as follows :—

explains how and why the number of                           necessarily
agree either with that of the arcualia or with that of the trunk
segments, e.g., Hexanchus and tail of most other Elasmobranchs.
  These leading differences and their modi<U+FB01>cations have been traced
in Petromyzon, Acipenser, Amia, Lepidosteus, Protopterus, Chimaera,
and in numerous Elasmobranchs.
  In Amie calva, of which the adult and a young specimen of 57 mm.
were examined, the postcentrum, i.e., the posterior, archless disk of a
complete tail-vertebra, was found to be formed by the interdorsalia
and interventralia of the same sklerotome, while the precentmm, Le.

 tome.     Thus skleromere 50 is composed of a postcentrum = inter
 dorsal 50 + interventral 50, and of a precentrum = basidorsal 50 +
 basiventral 49. The intermuscular septum runs obliquely across the
 precentrum, or, in other words, the precentra are bi~prot0vertebral or
 bi-myomeric, but not the postcentra. The precentra of the tail of
 Amia are homologous with the “pleurocentra” in the tail of the
 Jurassic Eurycormns, while Amia’s postcentra are the same as the
 “                ”
   hypocentra of Eurycormus.
    In Ilepidostens~ osseus, of which adult specimens and larvaa of various
 stages were examined, the combination of parts into one vertebral
 complex is superior to that of Amia, because each vertebra belongs,
 with its entire anterior half (interdorsal 50 + basiventral 50), to
 myomere 50, and with its posterior half (basidorsal 51 + interventral
 51), to myomere 51. In other words, the vertebral mass is equally
 divided between two successive myomeres, or the myomeres have an
 equal share of the skleromeres.         The vertebrae are now truly bi
 protovertebral or bi-myomeric, each vertebra being composed of
 a + b.

      Professor LANKESTER, F.R.S. Received May 30, 1894.
                                  (Abstract)
   I have had the opportunity of making a renewed examination of
the structure of Heliopora, partly through the kindness of Professor
Ray Lankester, who gave _me a very well preserved fragment of a
colony brought by Dr. S. J. Hickson from Talisse, Celebes.              I have
also used some specimens which        I collected and preserved   in  spirit in
Diego Garcia, and, in studying the dried corallum,          I  have had the
advantage of a large collection, originally the pr0perty of the late
Mr. George Brook, which Mrs. Brook has very kindly handed over
to me.
   All the specimens in my possession are referable to the only recent
species known, Heliopom cwrulea, but one of them belongs to the
variety tuberosa, Dana.

munication between the polyps and their connecting canals on one
side of the colony and those on the other side of the colony.
   The polyps have been fully described by Moseley.             They are
scattered irregularly over the surface, and the only important feature
presented by them, in which they differ from other Alcyonaria, is the
complete introversion of the tentacles during retraction. Surrounding
each polyp, and occupying all the surface of the colony, are very
numerous tubes, ending blindly below, and closed above by the sheet
of super<U+FB01>cial ectoderm which covers the exterior surface; these are
the caenenchymal caeca. They occupy cavities in the corallum known
as coenenchymal tubes, and are set at right angles to the surface of
the colony. The coenenchymal coeca communicate with one another,
and with the polyps, by means of a network of canals, which lies close
beneath the surface; these are the super<U+FB01>cial endode'r'mic canals.
   At the growing edges of the colony the super<U+FB01>cial network is not
well developed, the coenenchymal coeca are closely contiguous, and
open into one another at their outer ends, either directly or by means
of short, irregular, transverse passages which cross over the partitions
separating adjacent ccenenchymal tubes.
   The coenenchymal cceca, super<U+FB01>cial canals, and polyps are lined
internally with endoderm.      Outside this is a thin layer of mesogloea,
and outside of this an irregular layer of large, dark-staining,
granular, fusiform cells, which are calcigenous, and may be called
calicoblasts.
   The calicoblasts were described by Moseley as mesodermic, but
they occupy the position of ectoderm, and they are, in fact, derived
directly from the super<U+FB01>cial sheet of ectoderm.      Their origin is seen
in sections made perpendicularly to the surface of the colony at its
growing point.       Here the ectoderm cells are generally elongate and
pyriform, their broader outer ends resting on a distinct external
limiting membrane, their inner ends tapering and produced into long
processes, which may often be traced into connexion with deeper
seated fusiform cells, of more granular character.      The deeper seated
 cells are imbedded in a thick, homogeneous, gelatinous substance
 which lies immediately below the ectoderm, and is the newly formed
 mesogloea, thicker here than elsewhere       in the colony. Study of
 numerous     sections  shows that  the deeper seated fusiform cells are
derivatives of the elongate ectoderm cells, and that some of them are
 used up in the formation of the mesogloea—they appear to dissolve
 and to be wholly converted into a structureless gelatinous mass—
 whilst others increase in size, develop many refracting granules in
 their interior, and become calcigenous calicoblasts. In many places
 the calicoblasts may be traced into direct connexion with the
 ectoderm. The coenenchyma-l cceca of Heliopora do not appear to be
 degenerate siphonozooids, as was suggested by Moseley, but rather to

  be specialised parts of a system of inosculating        endodermic canals,
  such as are characteristic of colonial Alcyonaria.
      The  corallum of Heliopora     exhibits two sets of apertures, besides
  those due to the inroads of boring parasites, these are the calicles and
  the caenemhymal fenestne.       The calicle cavities are occupied by the
  polyps, the coenenchymal tubes, whose mouths are the fenestraa, are
  occupied by the    coeca, which do not in the fresh condition open to the
  surface, the fenestrw being closed above by the ectoderm.
      The corallum consists of an imaginary vertical plane, occupied by
  vertically disposed coenenchymal tubes, and right and left faces on
  which the tubes open after bending sharply from the vertical to take
'
  a short horizontal course.    The vertical tubes are in section polygonal,
  and some of them attain the surface at the growing edge.               Those
  which are de<U+FB02>ected horizontally become thickened by the formation
  of secondary calcareous deposits inside the primitively polygonal
  tubes.    The calicles are formed by the arrest in growth of groups of
  coenenchymal tubes as they approach the surface.           The cavity of a
  calicle never extends into the central vertical tubes.
      The walls of each coenenchymal tube are primarily formed of
  twelve delicate calcareous        laminae, secreted    by the calicoblasts
   covering   the coenenchymal   coeca, and   have this peculiarity, that each
  of the laminae      takes   a share   in  the formation of the walls of
  adjacent tubes.     As seen in section, three laminae are united at each
  angle of the generally hexagonal tube to form a Y-shaped <U+FB01>gure.
   Each arm of the     Y  meets, and is united by sutures with the arms of
   adjacent Y’s, and so a sort of honeycomb structure is produced,
  which, if the symmetry of growth were perfectly regular, would
   consist of a series of regular hexagons.       The symmetry is disturbed
   by the multiplication     of the tubes, which do not branch dichoto
   mously, as in the allied Heliolites, but increase by the addition and
   intercalation of new tubes amongst those previously existing.           The
   hexagonal primary constituents       of the corallum of Heliopora show
   very slight traces of blue colour, but as they become thickened by
   secondary ring-shaped deposits, the latter develop blue pigment, and
   give the characteristic colour to the colony.
      The growth of the colony is not e<U+FB01>ected, as Moseley described, by
   the upgrowth of an axial polyp from which lateral buds are given off,
   but by the rapid growth and multiplication of coenenchymal tubes.
      The fact that the calicles and coenenchymal tubes of Heliopora have
   not each their distinct and proper wall, but that their walls are
   common to them and to adjacent tubes, is a. characteristic feature of
   Heliopora and its allies.      I  therefore propose for them the name
    Camothecalia, in contradistiuction to those forms in which, as in
   Tubt'pom, each corallite is separate and distinct; the latter group
   may be called the Autotlzecalia.

     The genus Heliopora is not the only Alcyonarian with a distinct
 ectodermic skeleton.     I brought back with me from Diego Garcia
 two small Alcyonariaus of the genus Xenia. One of the species is
 referable to Xenia umbellata, Savigny, var. cae'rulea.      The other  I
 am describing elsewhere as a new species, under the name Xenia
 ga'rciaz.   These forms both possess a discontinuous skeleton, formed
 of the minute corpuscle-like spicules characteristic of the Xeniidae.
 In X. nmbellata, the spicules in the exsert moieties of the polyps are
 wholly ectodermic, and none are found in the mesogloea.          In the
 stem the external ectoderm is <U+FB01>lled with spicules, and the so-called
coenenchyme proves to be nothing more than the fused ectoderm of
the basal moieties of the polyps, which is traversed by strands of
mesogloea binding the polyps together, and by endodermic canals
which place the polyp cavities in communication with one another.
The mesogloea of the basal moieties of the polyps, as well as the
connecting strands of mesogloaa, are quite free from spicules, which
are, however, abundant in the mass of fused ectoderm occupying the
spaces between the polyps.
    In Xenia garciw the spicules are, as in X. umbellata, ectodermic in
the exsert moieties of the polyps, and in the ectoderm covering the
stem.      The basal moieties of the polyps are provided with a much
thicker mesogloea, which is, however, free from spicules, except
where the mesoglaaal laminae of adjacent polyps become fused, in
which case intrusive ectoderm cells and spicules are found in the
fused thickened areas.      Elsewhere the basal portions of the polyps
are separated, as in X. umbellata, by ectoderm containing spicules,
the mass of which is much less abundant than in X. umbellata.
There is also in X. garcioe a special system of super<U+FB01>cial endodermic
canals, which lies immediately below the surface in the upper part of
the stem.                                                ,
    I have  further been able to examine some specimens of Heteroxenia
elizabethw, collected by the late Dr. Gulliver,  at Zanzibar, and given
by him to the Linacre Department at Oxford.         1 am able to con<U+FB01>rm
Kelliker’s account of this genus, which exhibits a well-marked
dimorphism, the colony consisting of fertile autozeoids surrounded by
more numerous sterile siphonozooids. The spicules of Heterowenia
elizabethw resemble those of Xenia umbellatu      and garciw, in being
minute and entirely ectOdermic in the exsert moieties of the polyps.
The stem, however, differs considerably from that of X. nmbellata,
and is more specialised than that of X. garcioe. Instead of the

  mesoglceal  laminae of the basal moieties of the polyps being distinct
  or only partially fused together, they are absolutely and indis
 tinguis'hably fused, and the mesogloea is enormously thickened,
 forming a ccenenchymal mass resembling that of Alcyonium. [The
 mesogloea immediately surrounding             the polyp cavities is devoid
 of cells, but elsewhere it contains numerous intrusive cells, among
 which spicules are developed.         The intrusive cells are derivatives of
 the ectoderm, and in suitable preparations numerous strands of cells
 are seen to pass inwards from the ectoderm, between the rami<U+FB01>cations
 of the super<U+FB01>cial set of endodermic canals, which is rather more
 marked in this species than in X. garciw.              It seems probable that
 the greater part of the ccenenchymal            mesogloea is formed at the
 expense of the intrusive ectoderm cells, very few of which develop
 spicules.
    These three species are interesting, <U+FB01>rstly, as indicating the steps
 by which forms with a wholly mesogloeal spicular skeleton, such as
 Alcyonium, may have been derived from forms with an ectodermic
 skeleton; and, secondly, as suggesting the mode in which the ecto
 dermic skeleton of Heliopora may have been developed.                     In the
 Xeniidaa,   as in the Helioporidue, the bulk of the ccenenchymal
 mesogloea and the whole of the calcigenous elements are derived
 from the ectoderm.       In the one case the mesoglceal elements pre
 ponderate greatly     over  the calcigenous, in 'the other the preponde
rance of the calcigenous elements has led to the formation of a dense
 calcareous skeleton, the mesogloeal elements being reduced to a very
subordinate position.                       >

    The paths which degenerate after ablation of one lateral lobe of
the cerebellum, and after extirpation of its middle lobe, are discussed
in this paper.
    The former operation, viz., removal of one lateral lobe of the cere
bellum, results in degeneration of all the peduncles on the side of the
lesion, and in the superior peduncle of the opposite side; but no
<U+FB01>bres degenerate in the middle or interior peduncle of the opposite
side.    The degenerated <U+FB01>bres in the superior peduncle on the side

   304           Experimental    Lesions  of  the Cerebellum.     [J uue 21,
  of the lesion decussate in the posterior quadrigeminal region, and
  pass to the opposite red nucleus and optic thalamus.       None could be
  traced beyond this point. Those in the opposite superior peduncle
  represent <U+FB01>bres which degenerate in the cerebellum, passing from
  the seat of lesion across to the intact half of the organ, and leaving it
  by this peduncle. These degenerated <U+FB01>bres occupy a special position
  in the peduncle, a part of it which is comparatively free from
  degenerated <U+FB01>bres on the side of the lesion, and a part occupied by
  degenerated <U+FB01>bres on both sides, when the cerebellum is divided into
  two lateral halves by a mesial incision.      These facts are held to con
  trovert Marchi’s statement,      that none of the peduncles contain
  commissural <U+FB01>bres.
     The degenerated <U+FB01>bres in the middle peduncle, on the side of the
 lesion, pass chie<U+FB02>y to the grey matter of the Opposite side of the pons.
  Some degenerated <U+FB01>bres from this source pass between the pyramidal
 bundles, but there is no evidence to support Marchi’s observation,
 that degenerated <U+FB01>bres also pass from this peduncle in the <U+FB01>llet and
 posterior longitudinal bundle to the corpora quadrigemina and peri
 phery of the antero-lateral region of the spinal cord, and that some
 pass to the corpus striatum by way of.the pyramidal tract.
    Of the <U+FB01>bres which degenerate in the inferior peduncle, the
 majority occupy the lateral region of the medulla, becoming more and
 more scattered as they pass down. These can no.10nger be said to form
 a tract below the level of the superior pyramidal decussation; but a
 few scattered degenerated <U+FB01>bres occupy the antero-lateral region of
 the cervical cord, beyond which none can be traced.           Degenerated
 <U+FB01>bres pass to both inferior olives from this peduncle; but no well
 marked tract to the opposite inferior olive, as described by Ferrier
 and Turner, was found.       In accordance with these observers, how
 ever, no corroboration    of Marchi’s  results was found, in so far as he
 states that degenerated <U+FB01>bres pass from this peduncle to the ascending
 root of the <U+FB01>fth, the roots of the cranial nerves through the posterior
 longitudinal bundles, and the spinal nerves by the descending antero
lateral tract.
    In con<U+FB01>rmation of Marchi, and contrary to the observations of
Ferrier and Turner, degenerated <U+FB01>bres were found in all the
peduncles of the cerebellum, after extirpation of its middle lobe.
Those in the superior peduncle occupy all parts of it, as seen on
transverse section, they decussate in the region of the posterior
corpora quadrigemina, and terminate in the opposite red nucleus,
beyond which point no degenerated <U+FB01>bres could be traced.
    The degenerated <U+FB01>bres in the middle peduncle behave much as do
those which result from ablation of one lateral lobe of the cerebellum,
and the same may be said with regard to the degenerated <U+FB01>bres in
the inferior peduncle.      No evidence was found to support Marchi’s

1894.]      On some of    the Decztssating   Tracts of the Brain, &0.        305
statement that degenerated <U+FB01>bres from this source pass to the cranial
nerve roots through the posterior longitudinal bundles, and to the
antero-lateral columns of the cord by way of the <U+FB01>llet.
   With regard to the well-marked antero-lateral tract, which Marchi
describes as degenerating throughout the whole length of the spinal
cord, it is held, in conjunction with Ferrier and Turner, that no such
tract degenerates after lesions limited to the cerebellum. And in sup'
port of this negative view being probably the correct one, is adduced
the fact that Ferrier and Turner found 'a similar tract after injury to
Deiter’s nucleus, as did Mott also, after injury to the posterior
column nuclei.

the Royal Society, February, 1894, entitled           aContribution to the
Study of the Descending Degenerations in the Brain and Spinal
Cord.”     It based upon a study of the changes found in the brains
               is
and spinal cords of the animals (cats) used for that research.
   1. It found that hemisections of the mesencephalon through the
          is
superior quadrigeminal region           isfollowed by degeneration of
Meyne’rt’s  commissure  and Forel’s clecussation, situated in front of the
third ventricle  and  behind the  optic chiasma.
   The degenerate <U+FB01>bres which go to form the decimation            Forel are
                                                                   of
large medullated <U+FB01>bres which ascend from the seat of injury in the
tegmental region, proceed forwards and anteriorly, and then curve
round in front of the third ventricle, between the latter and Mey
nert’s commissure.      They then pass backwards, between the optic
tract and the internal capsule (pes peduneuli), and appear to end in
the lateral thalamic region. This description agrees with that given
by Darkschewitch       and Pribytkow, who, however, state that the
<U+FB01>bres terminate in the lenticular nucleus; by the Marchi method,
on the other hand, the Author has traced the <U+FB01>bres past this nucleus,
and across the internal capsule into the thalamus.
   The <U+FB01>bres appear to be part of the <U+FB01>bres constituting the “ foun
tain (ventral) decussation of Forel.”

   Meynert’s Uommissure.-—This    commissure is also invariably found
degenerate, but the author    has  been unable to determine its exact
mode of origin and termination.     It would appear that the commis
sure had a wide <U+FB01>eld of origin, numerous <U+FB01>bres either passing
through or arching round the pes pedurwuli on its dorsal aspect to
form it. The <U+FB01>bres pass to the opposite side behind the chiasma,
and then descend slightly, and appear to diminish in number; they
do not appear to enter the corpus Luysi'i; a few of the <U+FB01>bres may
penetrate with the optic tract into the thalamic region, and inter
mingle with the super<U+FB01>cial <U+FB01>bres of the superior <U+FB01>llet (compare
                                                                  “ Die
Darkschewitoh and Pribytkow, and more recently Bechterew in
Leitungsbahnen ”).
   2. Posterior C'ommissure.—The degenerate <U+FB01>bres which cross in the
commissure or in the roof of the Aqueduct of Sylvius, and which
result from a complete unilateral lesion of the quadrigeminal area,
have not a long course, but terminate, for the most part, in the
opposite   corpora quadrigemina, dorsal and lateral aspects of the
Sylvian grey matter, or posterior portion of the tegmentum.
   Degenerate <U+FB01>bres have never been traced into the posterior longi
tudinal bundles, as has been asserted by some authors. A special
group of large super<U+FB01>cial degenerate <U+FB01>bres in the anterior portion of
the roof of the aqueduct have been traced from the internal capsule
across the thalamus into the stalk of the superior corpus quadri
geminum and then across the commissure. These <U+FB01>bres alone are
found degenerate in the commissure when the anterior one-third of
the cat’s hemisphere is removed.
   3. In cases where the motor region is completely removed in the
cat, degenerate <U+FB01>bres are found which leave the pyramidal system in
the pes pedunculi, crusta, pons, and medulla. The <U+FB01>bres which leave
the pes pedunculi and crusta pass backwards to the quadrigeminal
region of the same side, those which leave the pyramid in the medulla
decussate across the raphe to the opposite side, and. lose themselves
in the tegmentum; they have not been traced directly ending in the
motor nuclei of the cranial nerves.    Muratoft has described a group
of these <U+FB01>bres in the medulla, and supposes that they are the cortical
motor <U+FB01>bres of the VIIth; the author, on the other hand, has not
found the <U+FB01>bres limited alone to this region. The decussation of the
pyramid is thus not con<U+FB01>ned to the upper cervical region, but is
gradually taking place during the descent of the pyramid through
the bulbar segments.

 “Further Experiments on the Action of Light on Bacillus
       anthracis, and on the Bacteria of the Thames.”                         By H.
       MARSHALL WARD, D.Sc., F.R.S., F.L.S., F.R.H.S., Professor
       of Botany, Cooper’s Hill.
    In   a previous Report         to the Committee,      I  have shown that the
 action   of  light  on  bacteria is not only very       de<U+FB01>nite,    and much more
 pronounced than had hitherto been supposed, but that it has an im
 portance in its bearing on the question of the destruction of these
 organisms in the water of rivers, ponds, &c., vastly greater than had
 ever been suspected.
    In this Report     I  offer some of the results of long continuous in
 vestigations into the details of this bactericidal action of light—both
solar and electric—and into the bacterial <U+FB02>ora of the River Thames,
as studied at a point where it <U+FB02>ows below Cooper’s Hill.
   The reader may be referred to the previous Reports" for details as
to the methods of investigation employed, and as to the chief results
obtained by exposing the spores of Bacillus anthracis to the direct
action of undecomposed solar light; he will also <U+FB01>nd further details
in two papers presented to the Royal Society in 1892 and 1893?
regarding this matter, and regarding preliminary investigations into
the action of solar light which has been passed through various
absorbent media.
   Special attention may be directed to pp. 23—34 of the ‘Pro
ceedings,’ vol. 53, and the following experimental results may in the
<U+FB01>rst place be taken as supplementing those there published.

   Before proceeding to the results obtained by exposure behind
coloured screens,   I select the following series of further experiments,
which con<U+FB01>rm some of my previous statements, referred to above
(Table A).
   It is worth remark that these exposures were made in February, at
a time when the temperature was low, and the sunlight, though
bright, of an intensity far below that obtainable in the summer.        The
methods of preparing the agar plates and <U+FB01>lms of dried spores,
have already been described, that is to say, in experiments num
bered D (1), E (1),       J (1), C and D, a plate of sterile agar was
exposed,   in  each  case behind  a stencil plate, and, after exposure, was
laid <U+FB02>at on a <U+FB01>lm of dried unexposed spores of B. anthracis, whereas
in the cases marked otherwise it was the <U+FB01>lm of spores which was
thus exposed, and a sterile plate of unexposed agar then placed on
the <U+FB01>lm. Incubation then decided whether the light had produced
any effect, the results being given in the table.
   These results fully con<U+FB01>rm those obtained previously, and show
that the action of the light is direct on the spores, and not on the
food material-in this case agar—in which the spores are suspended.
That the slow development in the cases marked H (1) and           I (1) was
due to de<U+FB01>cient aeration—possibly in part also to the <U+FB01>tful sunshine
to which the plates were exposed—is borne out by the following
experiments.      Three stout glass tubes were selected, sterilised, and
charged each with about 5 0.0. of bouillon, in which was distributed
a small loop-full of the spores of B. anthracis.       Each tube was about
Gin. long, and, after charging, was plugged with sterilised cotton
wool, the plug being pushed 2 in. into the tube.        Each tube was then
drawn out to a point, exhausted of air, and the end sealed in a <U+FB02>ame.
 The vacuum tubes were kept thus sealed until the following day,
when two of them were broken at the tips, in a <U+FB02>ame, to let in air;
 the other remained sealed.
    The sealed tube, and one of the now unsealed tubes, were then
 exposed all day to a bright sun, while the third (unsealed) tube was
 wrapped in tin-foil and black paper, and placed side by side with the
 others, thus protected from the light. After six or seven hours’ expo
 sure, the tip of the still sealed tube was also broken, and all three
 placed in the incubator at 22° C.
    In forty-eight hours the covered tube and the exposed sealed tube
 were equally and copiously turbid, with a vigorous growth of the
 bacillus ; the exposed unsealed tube showed the faintest traces only of
 this turbidity.
    The inference is obvious.     Exposure to sunlight in vacuo results in
 no perceptible retardation or destruction of the bacillus, whereas if

exposed in contact with air nearly all the spores are killed in the
time given. As will be shown later, the thickness of the glass of
which the tubes were composed is no doubt an important factor,'and
probably all the spores in the exposed unsealed tube would have been
killed had the glass been thinner, as they certainly could have been
by a longer exposure.*
                                       §  II.
    The following series of experiments were carried out during Feb
ruary and March of this year (1893) to obtain some information as
to the time of exposure necessary to kill the spores of Bacillus
                 I
anthracis, for found it desirable to make myself as well acquainted
as possible with the power of the solar rays in this respect, in order
to utilise the experience in succeeding work. As the table shows,              I
also tried comparisons between            the action of direct and that of
re<U+FB02>ected sunlight.       As the experiments proceeded, it turned out that
several di<U+FB02>iculties have to be met in attempting to compare the action
on two or more different plates exposed side by side.
    It seems impossible to ensure absolute similarity between any two
plates, for the following reasons :—
    1. The di<U+FB01>iculty of distributing the spores in equal quantities, and
at equal distances apart in the agar.          The best results were obtained
by pouring     the  agar  on  all  the  plates  from one large tube, in which
the infected melted agar      is  thoroughly shaken ; but even then it was
impossible to be sure that the agar <U+FB01>lm in each plate was of equal
thickness.      Of course practice and experience enable one to pour
 approximately the same quantity of the agar into each plate, but this
 does not entirely overcome the di<U+FB01>iculty.
     2. Even very careful selection from a large number of the Petri’s
 dishes does not secure that each dish used shall have a perfectly
 plane glass face (to be exposed), of equal thickness, and identical in
 its properties towards the light.        Here, again, therefore, one had to
 be satis<U+FB01>ed with as close approximations as possible.
     It was owing to these dif<U+FB01>culties that          I hit upon the device of
                                                             “ windows ” cut in
 employing one plate with several square or circular
 its covering, at equal distances            apart.    After exposing all the
 “windows ” for, say, half an hour, one was then covered; after a
 further exposure of half an hour, a second one was covered, and so
 forth (or, conversely, the windows uncovered in succession), as in
 the cases marked Ia to Id, and 5a to 5d, &c., on Table B.
     But another di<U+FB02>iculty now made itself evident, namely, that as the
  intensity of the solar light may vary considerably from time to time
  not only owing to altitude, but also to di<U+FB01>erences in the atmosphere,

                     Report on   the   Bacteriology of Water.                    323
 and to clouds passing, &c., 850., it seemed utterly hopeless to expect
 the accurately comparative results required.
    Taking all these drawbacks into consideration, the Table B never
 theless shows some signi<U+FB01>cant and instructive facts.
    The experiment denoted Ia, for instance, shows that, even in March,
 the solar action can be detected clearly after so short an exposure as
 half an hour to an hour, while exposures of 1% to 2 hours resulted in
 sharp, clear <U+FB01>gures.
    After a large number of these comparative trials, however,      con      I
 cluded (1) that while it seems impossible to overcome all the dif<U+FB01>
 culties, and to express the nature of the exposure in words, the
 general impression gathered was that on certain bright, sunny days
in the spring—days when the sky is blue and cloudless, and the air
peculiarly clear, the bactericidal power of the direct or re<U+FB02>ected solar
rays is very great—much greater than has been supposed.          A very
slight amount of haze makes a vast difference in the times of expo
sure (e.g., Cases A (I), and B (1), where a much better result was
obtained in two hours in the one case than with three hours in the
other) ; (2) that very long exposures are necessary if the sky is over
cast with clouds, even though the light is otherwise bright.    In other
words, the direct rays of the sun are needed for the purpose of rapid
action; (3) with solar light, direct from the sun, very little if any
difference can be detected between exposures where the rays fall
directly on the plate, and where they are once re<U+FB02>ected from a thin
plane glass mirror silvered at the back.*
   Summed up in the shortest terms, the conditions of exposure are
practically the same as those required in ordinary photography, the
chief diiIerence being that the duration of the exposures amounts
roughly to hours or half hours in the cases under consideration,
instead of minutes or seconds, as in quick plate photography.        All
this, of course, points to the blue end of the spectrum as the effective
one, a conclusion which is abundantly justi<U+FB01>ed, and, in fact, fully
proved in the sequel, and by my experiments with the spectrum since
published-1'
                                         §   III.
  In  the following sets of exposures (Table C),              I
                                                       employed quartz,
instead of glass, as a covering to the Petri’s plates, so that, except in
the cases 12A, 12B, and 120, the light traversed no glass before
reaching the spore-laden <U+FB01>lm.
   The results show little additional information, excepting that in the
cases 12D and 12E it was interesting to <U+FB01>nd that the action was
approximately as pronounced after one hour of exposure as after
               * This remark refers particularly to this kind of exposure.

two and a half hours, and distinctly more so in both cases than where
glass was employed in addition.
                                    §  IV.
    The following series of experiments (Table D) were made in con
 tinuation of the foregoing, and the description of glass screen em
 ployed (3rd column) refers to the table on pp. 328—329.
    The chief feature of novelty is that      I  here used the same plate
for different screens, as follows.      A thick, opaque cardboard screen
 was prepared as large as the plates, and this screen perforated with
four or <U+FB01>ve circular or square windows. Over each hole a piece of
 the coloured or other glass to be employed was then cemented, and the
 whole held in contact with the plate to be exposed, by elastic bands.
    The advantage of this prooeeding was that        I could check the pre
 ceding  results, to  see if any erroneous conclusion had resulted from
my using different plates.
                                     §v.
    In order to investigate  more in detail the action of the decomposed
 sunlight on the spores,   I made a series of glass screens of the nature
of water cells, or reservoirs, as follows.     A number of circular, <U+FB02>at,
indiarubber packing rings, about a quarter of an inch thick and three
inches internal diameter were obtained, and a small piece cut out of
each ; then a thin, plain piece of glass was cemented to each side of
the now incomplete ring, thus forming a reservoir with two large
parallel glass ends, the sides being formed of indiarubber.         I found
that by carefully cementing the glass with gold size, it held very
well, at least for two or three experiments, and could easily be re
cemented    if necessary.
    These glass cells were <U+FB01>lled with the coloured transparent solu
tions to be referred to (see Table E), and then placed over the
exposed letter on the prepared plate as described in my previous
paper (‘ Proc. Roy. Soc.,’ vol. 52, p. 393), being held in position by clips

or elastic bands, and the whole then so <U+FB01>xed that the sunlight had to
traverse the coloured or other <U+FB02>uid before reaching the agar <U+FB01>lm in
which the spores were embedded.     It will, of course, be noticed that
the light here traverses three plates of glass as well as the solution
of the screen before impinging on the spores in the <U+FB01>lm, a fact of                  _
importance.
  I  have summed up the characters and chief properties of the solu
tions employed in the following Table E, andneed not, therefore,
describe them in detail here.   In all cases, excepting Nos. 3 and 5,
the medium employed for solution was water; in these exceptional
cases, where carbon bisulphide and alcohol were used, it was neces
 @@
sary to have screens devoid of cement.    These were met with in the
forni of certain small glass <U+FB02>asks, shaped like brandy <U+FB02>asks or scent
<U+FB02>asks, with along neck and <U+FB02>at sides ; they are used on the Continent
for scaling up cultures of bacteria.
                                      FIG.   2
   The chief objection to their use is that the <U+FB02>at sides are apt to be
slightly uneven in thickness on the internal face ; by carefully select
ing from a large number, however,            I
                                      was able to secure several very
good  screens of this description?” The  liquid    of course, bottled in
                                                       is,
the usual way, and the neck secured with    a good cork.
                                      §   VI.
   The following Table    summarises the results of a number of expo
                            F
sures behind these screens of coloured and other absorbent media,
with particulars as to the dates of exposure, number of hours, insola
tion, and incubation, and other factors worth extracting from the
notes.
  It will   be observed that I    here con<U+FB01>ned my experiments entirely to
the spores of Bacillus anthracis.     Idid this because        it
                                                            became more
and more evident that until       had obtained all the information possi
                                 I'
ble about some one species—the factor most constant in this long
series of slight variables—it would be di<U+FB02>icult to value the import
ance of speci<U+FB01>c di<U+FB01>erences later.     Experience has thoroughly              con
<U+FB01>rmed the justice of this conclusion.
 *   In later experiments
                        I   have had the side ground out <U+FB02>at, and glass or quartz
plates cemented on.

     If we now look at the results tabulated above, it is seen that the
solar action is evident, though feeble, through dilute fuchsin, aesculin
and quinine, and picric acid; while no trace of action occurred
through potassium chromate, chlorophyll, eosin, and strong fuchsin.
     On the other hand, the action was sharply de<U+FB01>ned where am
moniacal cupric oxide or water alone was employed, and also where
alum dissolved in water was used.            In other words, the action is
most pronounced when         the  rays transmitted    are those of the blue
violet end of the spectrum, bearing out the results already obtained
more generally.
     During the progress of the experiments above tabulated, a number
of other points of interest were observed.           With carbon bisulphide
and iodine     it frequently happened    that  no letter was obtained on the
plates (Expts. J, 3, 1110;, 7, 9a), but occasionally the light action was
recorded by the appearance of the letter (Expts. S, 11117, B2). The
fact is, the solution did transmit a scarcely perceptible amount of
violet rays, and since       I  could. not discover any de<U+FB01>nite relation
between      the  times of  exposure and the results, one of two possibili
ties suggested itself—either differences in the thickness of the glass
 of the plates, or differences in the degree of clearness of the atmo
 sphere may account for the discrepancies.             Probably both causes
 were effective, for, of course, they both aifect these violet rays con
 siderably.
      Another phenomenon repeatedly noticed, both in these experiments
 and in others, was that if the exposure to a very bright sun is con
 tinued too long, and especially if the plate is not very accurately at
 right angles to the direction of the rays, the light may clear the
 plates entirely, or nearly so.      This seems to be due to the re<U+FB02>ections
 of the light from the glass surfaces inside the Petri’s dishes ; if the
 light is very intense, or the exposure long, these re<U+FB02>ected rays are
 suf<U+FB01>ciently powerful to produce elfects similar to those of the direct
 light.
      This  seems to me to    explain another phenomenon very commonly
 met with.       In many cases of long exposure to clear hot sunshine, the
  <U+FB01>rst evidence of the successful light action is not a sharp-well-de<U+FB01>ned
  letter, but a blurred clear patch, which slowly sharpens up as incuba
  tion goes on.
      It is evident that in such cases the action of the light has extended
 beyond the boundaries of the stencil letter, into parts of the <U+FB01>lm
  really not exposed to the direct incident rays.        I explain this as due
  to the re<U+FB02>ection of some of the rays from the glass surfaces in the
  interior of the plate.
       These re<U+FB02>ected rays are not sumciently intense to complete the
   bactericidal action, they only inhibit the organism more or less, or at
   least leave many spores still alive; consequently, while these out

                 Report on the Bacteriology    of Water.              335
lying   spores germinate more slowly than those further away from
the illuminated area—the stencil letter—they do at last germinate
out, and so the previously blurred letter becomes sharp and clear in
outline.
    The phenomenon very much resembles the development of the
indistinct “ghosts” of letters in cases where the exposure is too
short, or the light not suf<U+FB01>ciently intense, or wanting in active rays.
 Such faint letters gradually become obliterated as incubation pro
ceeds, because the spores, still alive but only retarded in develop
ment, gradually germinate out to an extent so little differing from
the rest that the eye fails to detect any diiference.
    The retarded development of a few colonies, at a late period of in
cubation, on the hitherto clear area of the exposed letter, is due to
similar causes, but produced in a slightly di<U+FB01>erent way. It is ex
tremely di<U+FB02>icult (probably impossible) to thoroughly distribute the
 spores in the <U+FB01>lm so that some do not shelter others from the light;
 consequently, when a clump of spores exists on the exposed area
 some of the inner spores may so far escape the bactericidal action as
 to be able to germinate out later, and   I have had many experiences of
 these cases.     In fact, the chief point about a good <U+FB01>lm—lie“ one
 which develops a sharp letter after ordinary exposure—is that the
 spores shall be neither too few nor too many, and thoroughly and
 evenly separated and distributed; and, lastly, that the agar or other
 medium shall not be too thick, and thus render possible the ordering
 of long rows of spores one behind another (i.e., in rows parallel to the
 ray of incident light) which thus shelter one another from the light’s
 action.
    These points, and some others, come out still more clearly in the
 next series of experiments.
                                   § VII.
    The following series of experiments were made behind superposed
 screens, and  it must be borne in mind that the light had to traverse
 not only a double thickness of solution, but also <U+FB01>ve thicknesses of
 glass, before reaching the spores.
    On the whole these results may be regarded as simply con<U+FB01>rming
 the previous ones, but    I was (and still am) considerably puzzled by
 the behaviour of the iodine and carbon bisulphide screens. In several
 cases the plates seem to be destroyed by the light passing through
 this medium, and for some time I was doubtful Whether there might
 not be a cumulative e<U+FB01>ect due to the action of the infra-red rays.     It
 seemed extremely probable that these rays—the “ dark
                                                            ” heat

 do help to promote the bactericidal action, and      I  thought perhaps
 because they accelerate the chemical changes on which the action
 depends.

     However, on comparing the action of a thick crystal of rock-salt
 with that of water and alum, I was unable to detect any such marked
 difference as would seem to follow if that conclusion were correct.
 As will be seen more clearly later, when                    I  come to discuss the results
 obtained with the spectrum, the infra-red rays are themselves utterly
 without perceptible e<U+FB02>iect.*
                                             § VIII.
     The following series of experiments,                       designed to estimate the
 degree      of light action on water bacteria, was carried out, under my
 direction and supervision, by Miss Hayward, of University College,
 London, and          I owe it to her to state that their successful carrying
out would have been impossible—0n account of the numerous plates to
 be counted, in short periods, and involving very large numbers—but
for her untiring industry and devotion to the work.
                                              Series  I.
    About 150 c.c. of Thames water, collected at 10 A.M. on August 12,
were distributed equally in three Erlenmeyer <U+FB02>asks, properly steri
 lised, and the <U+FB02>asks labelled A, B, and C ; and at 11 A.M. a l-drop plate
 was made from each <U+FB02>ask.                   These plates, examined and counted on
August 141       at   11  A.M., gave respectively 1560, 1700, and 1080 colonies
per c.c.—i.e., an average of 1446 colonies per c.c. developing in two
days.       On keeping the plates another day, two of them gave 3705
and 1656 respectively, while the third was uncountable and lique<U+FB01>ed,
the mean being 2680.
    We, therefore, assume that the water contained at the outset about
2700 bacteria per c.c., capable of developing in three days.
    The <U+FB02>asks were then placed as follows :—A was suspended by the
neck so that it could be exposed to what sunshine there was, and at
the same time be illuminated from below by the light re<U+FB02>ected from
a plane silvered mirror.
    B and C merely stood by the side of the stand supporting A, 0
being covered with tin-foil and black paper, while B was exposed to
the light from above and at the sides.
    After standing thus from 12 noon to 4.30 ML, the weather being
very cloudy with only occasional bursts of sunshine, fresh samples
were taken from each <U+FB02>ask by means of sterilised pipettes, and new
plates made to see if any changes had occurred of note.
    Taking <U+FB01>rst the plate from A, after two days’ incubation, we found
1599 colonies per c.c.; and after a further twenty-four hours, 2760
per c.c., of which 12 per cent; 'were liquefying forms.                        The number
of living bacteria capable of developing in two to three days, there

fore, was approximately the same as at the outset, and the     dull light
seems to have prevented the usual rapid multiplication.
   The plate from B, made after exposure, gave us 680 colonies per c.c.
after two days’ and 2550 colonies per c.c. after three days’ incubation,
and showed evident signs of liquefaction.      Here, therefore, it would
seem that the light ha-d exercised an inhibitory action as to numbers.
   The plate from G gave 2268 colonies per c.c. after three days’ in
cubation, but it was liquefying still more rapidly.
   So far, therefore, with the dull light of a cloudy day, it did not
seem as if an exposure of four and a half hours gave results of mu ch
signi<U+FB01>cance as to the numbers of bacteria ; but it did seem as if the
plates from the exposed <U+FB02>asks showed less liquefaction.
   Meanwhile, the three <U+FB02>asks stood at a temperature of about 16° C.
overnight in the laboratory, and were exposed next day from
 11.30 A.M. to 4.30 P.M.—-again a dull day, and practically no sunshine
at all.
 ~ Before
            exposure, however, we took samples as before, and after
two days’ incubation found that A had about 13,650 per c.c., B had
15,980 per c.c., and C was so badly lique<U+FB01>ed that we could place no
reliance on the numbers (1584) counted.
   These numbers are not very satisfactory taken by themselves, but
they showed us that the matter was worth further investigation along

                                  §  IX.
   On August 14th, three <U+FB02>asks were prepared and exposed as before;
A' with mirror beneath, B' with no mirror, and C' wrapped up.
Fairly bright sunshine prevailed during the exposure—from 11.15 to
4.30—8.11 occasional   cloud obscuring the sun.
   Two samples showed that A' started with 1755 per 0.0. and 1404,
the mean being 1578 per c.c.        After <U+FB01>ve hours’ exposure, over the
mirror, plates were again taken. Three plates yielded 1326, 780, and
858 per 0.0., the mean being 988 per 0.0., which looks as if a perceptible
reduction had occurred.
   Two plates from B' at the start gave 680 and 2176, the mean being
1423 per 0.0.    After its <U+FB01>ve hours’ exposure, without a mirror, three
samples yielded 918, 476, and 476 per 0.0., the mean being 623 per cc,
and again suggesting effect of bactericidal rays.
   Plates from C' at the beginning gave 1156 as the number to start
with, and after the <U+FB01>ve hours side by side with the other <U+FB02>asks, but
protected from the sunshine by foil and paper, samples gave 3240,
2052, and one uncountable.       The mean, = 2646 per 0.0., suggesting a
perceptible increase.
   Here, again, it was evident that liquefaction took place much more
rapidly on the plates from the unexposed flask than on those from the
<U+FB02>asks exposed to light.
   The chief dif<U+FB01>culty with these mixed plates is always that caused
by the liquefying forms, one of which was especially troublesome,
often coming on so rapidly that a plate which looked “safe” at a
given time would be ruined three or four hours later.
   The foregoing results are summarised in the following Table I.
   Without attempting to lay too much stress on the actual numbers
in this series, it is pretty evident that if we take the totals or the
means of the numbers of bacteria obtained from the water by taking
three samples from each <U+FB02>ask at each period of examination, we get
at least some information as to the rate of action of the light on the
total organisms.
   Put thus, the facts run as follows :—Of the nine samples taken at
the start, four were not counted, as they lique<U+FB01>ed too rapidly.        The
average of the other <U+FB01>ve gave 14.34: per 0.0.
   Flask A', after <U+FB01>ve.hours.’ exposure over a mirror, gave 988 per c.c.
as the mean of three samples.
   Flask B', after <U+FB01>ve hours’ exposure without a mirror, gave 623 per
0.0. as the mean of three plates.
   Flask 0', not exposed, but otherwise treated similarly, gave 2646
as the mean of two plates.
   It seems impossible to doubt, therefore, that the exposure to light
reduced the numbers by nearly one-half. But this proportion becomes

                   Report on the Bacteriology        of Water.                  341
much greater if we note that during the period an enormous multipli
cation would normally occur.
                                       §X.
   On August 15th two Erlenmeyer <U+FB02>asks were charged as before
with Thames water, and labelled A and C. A was exposed over
 mirrors, and C wrapped up.       We introduced the di<U+FB01>erence here of
having an additional mirror behind the <U+FB02>ask, as well as that below.
    The day was bright, with plenty of sunshine all the time, and A
 was exposed for       5,1,
                          hours—from 10.30 a.m. to         4!p.m.—and then
 samples taken from both.
   Meanwhile, the average of seven samples taken at the commence
ment gave 16454, as the number per           c.c. in the Thames water at
                                                 1
starting.
   Unfortunately, the temperature rose during the next twenty-four
hours sul<U+FB01>ciently to soften the gelatine of the plates taken after the
<U+FB01>rst  5%  hours, so we could not count these.
   On August I<U+FB01>th—another bright, clear day—the <U+FB02>ask               was again
                                                                    A
exposed    for six hours,  and     (wrapped up)
                                   C                 beside      it,
                                                                  both <U+FB02>asks
having stood all night (nearly 12 hours), at 18°          C in a cupboard in
the laboratory.
   After- this second exposure the plates gave—for A about GOOO'per
0.0., and for  C  over 174,000 per c.c.; showing that the exposure to the
light had kept down the numbers in A, in spite of the interval of
twelve hours in warm, dark cupboard, when, of course, the bacteria
                   a
not killed 0E by the <U+FB01>rst day’s exposure multiplied rapidly.
   Here, again,    I was struck by the diminution of the liquefaction
on the plates from the <U+FB02>ask A;            did not look like merely fewer
                                           it
liquefying    forms,  but  as    those
                                  if    that   were present really lique<U+FB01>ed
less rapidly and less efficiently than those from the <U+FB02>ask not exposed~
to light.

(being <U+FB01>ve hours), but only about one and a half to two hours at
most was good sunlight, the day being showery with snatches of blue
sky at intervals.
  Four samples taken at the beginning of the experiment gave 800,
1408, 748, and 1462 per c.c. as the numbers after two days’ incubation.

    After another day’s incubation         one plate was lique<U+FB01>ed;       the others
 gave 832, 1920, and 816.        Total of three plates = 3568 ; average ='
 1189 colonies per     c.c., and   this may be taken as the highest number
 obtainable, the counting having been done and checked very carefully
 and thoroughly with a good lens.
    After the <U+FB01>ve hours’ exposure, new plates were made—two from
 each of the <U+FB02>asks—and, in order to obviate as far as possible our
 previous difficulties with the liquefying forms, we diluted each 1 c.c.
 of the sample water with 9 c.c. of sterile distilled water, carefully
 prepared in advance.
    It is unnecessary to give details as to sterilisation, &c., but the
 following are the essential points of the plan followed:                  For each
 sample    to be taken  two  pipettes    and   two  test-tubes  are needed.     One
 of the test-tubes of each pair is graduated to hold 9 c.c. of the sterile
 water; into the other 1 c.c. of the water to be tested is dropped with
 one pipette, and the 9 c.c. of sterile water are then poured on to this,
 thus ensuring thorough and rapid mixture.                 The second pipette is
 then used    to obtain  the one  or   more   drops   taken to make the gelatine
 P late.
    By this method we found that two plates from                 F 3 (the exposed
 <U+FB02>ask)    gave   2880 and    1280   per    c.c.  on  the  4th  day.    Total of two
 plates,  4160;   mean,   2080  per  c.c.,  suggesting    that  the  light  was not
 strong enough     to prevent   the  bacteria    from   multiplying.     On  stand
 ing two days longer these plates gave 3840 and 1600; total, 5440;
 mean, 2720 colonies per c.c., showing that there were a good many
 slowly developing germs present, and we were struck with the paucity
 of liquefying forms.
    Two plates from F 4 (the unexposed <U+FB02>ask), made and examined at
 corresponding times, and in the same way, gave 660 and 2310 per c.c.
 on the fourth day.       Total, 2970;;mean, 1485 colonies per c.c. ; and
 on the <U+FB01>fth day (we could not go further)                 660 and 3630; total,
'4290; mean, 2145 colonies per c.c.
    So far, therefore, the numbers in the two <U+FB02>asks did not appear to
 be appreciably affected by the little sunlight that reached the water.
     The two <U+FB02>asks were now placed in an ice-safe over night, for expo
 sure next day.      They remained on ice about 14 hours.
    Next morning, August 23, these <U+FB02>asks were again put out at 9 A.M.,
 and remained till about 4 P.M. (over seven hours); but it rained
 steadily all the time except the last hour, when the sun shone.
    Two plates, made of diluted samples as before, from each <U+FB02>ask,
 were made at noon on this day, with the following results: After two
 days‘ incubation the plates from <U+FB02>ask F 3 (exposed) showed 39,600
 and 37,620 per c.c. Total of two plates, 77,220; mean, 38,610. After
 a further day’s incubation the plates gave 47,190 and 41 250 ; total,
 88,770; mean, 44,385 per c.c.

                 Report on the Bacteriology          of Water.               345
   The two plates from <U+FB02>ask F 4! (not exposed), examined at the same
time, gave 10,800 and 7,200 per c.c. in two days.          Total, 18,000;
mean, 9000 per c.c.; and, in three days, they showed 13,200 and an
uncountable number, owing to liquefaction.
   These results were decidedly mystifying at <U+FB01>rst, for they showed
apparently a stimulating effect of exposure to the light; but on going
further into the matter it seems more probable that what really
happens is, that (1) the sunlight was not powerful enough in blue
                                                                                   '
violet rays to produce any appreciable inhibition in the time; and (2)
the <U+FB02>ask F 4!,covered in tin foil, &c., did not become warmed so rapidly
as the other, and consequently still showed the retarding action of
the icing to which it had been subjected.
   That this explanation  is   right is borne out by the behaviour of the
plates taken at  4  P.M.—t'.e., after four hours’ further exposure of the
<U+FB02>asks—for the covered <U+FB02>ask, although kenormously increased in
 bacteria, was still behind the exposed one.
   After two days’ incubation, the two plates from          F (exposed) at
                                                                 3

two days’ incubation, and were not counted further.
   Considering the enormous expenditure of time and trouble involved
in making and counting these plates, we were somewhat discouraged
by these negative results, which are summarised in the accompany
ing Table J   (p. 346, &c.).

   On August 2~tth two <U+FB02>asks .of Thames water labelled          and  F   5   F6
were exposed exactly as the last, but the weather was <U+FB01>ne and we
had much bright sun and blue sky, with rapidly moving white
clouds.

         We estimated the actual exposure to daylight i as 18 hours, and about
        8  hours’ good sun altogether.
           In orderto extend our numbers whence we drew the average of
        bacteria present at the commencement, twelve samples were taken
        for plates to begin with, and we diluted to in 10 as before.        l
           After three days’ incubation we found four of the plates too far
        lique<U+FB01>ed to count, but the numbers would probably not be incon

           The eight plates gave a total of 10,890 0010nies, and an average of
        1361 colonies per c.c. in the water at the commencement of the experi

       posed to the light, and numbers too high                            to count in that covered
       with foil and paper; moreover, the latter plates were so badly lique
       fying that their marked contrast to the former could not escape
       observation.
           It was clear that exposure to sunlight affects the liquefying powers
       of the forms in the Thames water, and this apart either from the
        difference in numbers on the plates or because it eliminates these
        forms more rapidly.
                                                       §   xv.
           On August 29 two <U+FB02>asks were prepared as before.                                          F 11 was
        exposed      to sun with mirrors, &c., and F 12 put by its side covered

            The <U+FB01>rst exposure was from 9.30 AM. to 12.30 Ann—three hours’
        good sunshine, though with occasional clouds.
            The water to start with was estimated to contain about 1200 germs
        per   0.0.
            After three hours’         exposure     F     11 gave, as the         result of two plates,

99 and 132;      total: 231; mean = 115 per c.c. After the same
time F 12 (unexposed) gave 1600 and 1920; total, 3520; mean, 1760.
   The <U+FB02>asks were meanwhile put back and exposed yet another
4%; hours to the afternoon sunshine—11.0., from 12.30 to 5 P.M.—of
which about 3% hours counted as bright sunshine.
   Two plates from F 11 made at 5.30 gave 248 and 279; total, 527;
mean, 268 colonies as the number per 0.0. ; while two plates made at
the same time from the unexposed <U+FB02>ask (F 12) were so badly lique
<U+FB01>ed that, although we estimated 3300 per 0.0. from one of them, we
regard the numbers as really higher.
   These <U+FB02>asks stood in the laboratory over-night at a temperature of
18° C., and were then exposed next day from 11.30 A.M. to 4.30 P.M.,
about one and a half or two hours of the <U+FB01>ve being sunny. Then, at
5 P.M., fresh plates were prepared.
   Two plates from the exposed <U+FB02>ask gave 640 and 3200 per 0.0. re
spectively; total, 3840; mean, 1920 per 0.0.     The numbers are not
very good, as there is such a great difference between the two plates.
   Two plates from the unexposed <U+FB02>ask gave 12,800 and 16,000 per
0.0.; total, 28,800; mean, 14,400 per 0.0., again bearing out the con
clusion that the sun has powerful action on the exposed water.
                                §   XVI.
   To my mind one of the most important discoveries elicited from these
plate cultures of Thames water was the obvious reduction of liquefac
tion on the plates made from water exposed to light, and so struck was
I with the differences between these plates and those made with the
water not exposed that I made an independent investigation into the
matter by selecting a set of the most pronounced liquefying forms
from the water and examining their behaviour when exposed to lightr
side by side with that of non-exposed samples.
    I started with the commonest and most pronounced liquefyingv
                                           I

Colony [3 in my notes, and write it shortly      [3.   I had noticed the
following facts concerning it    during our experiments on the action of
light on the Thames water as collected—it should be borne in mind
thatI    had already studied its characters and knew the form pretty
well.
   In the <U+FB01>rst place the plates as awhole lique<U+FB01>ed very much more slowly
and less completely than those made from unexposed water. Secondly,
although it   seemed at times as    if  this was because the form B   had
been eliminated from the water, I     suspected that
                                                  a   certain other form,

                      Report on   the   Bacteriology of Water.              355
     On September      3 a   small loopful of a gelatine culture of the bacillus
)3   was carefully shaken in about 50 c.c. of sterile water, and distributed
equally in two Erlenmeyer <U+FB02>asks labelled [3 (1) and B
   Flask B (1) was wrapped in foil and black paper; <U+FB02>         was ex
posed over mirror from 9.30 A.M. to 5 P.M., and about <U+FB01>ve hours of
these seven and a half were good strong sunshine.    Thermometers in
control <U+FB02>asks went up to 34—35° C. as the highest temperature regis
tered in the afternoon.
   At 9.30 a plate was prepared from each <U+FB02>ask, and gave something
like 3,000,000 per c.c. as the average numbers to start with.
   After exposure, two plates were prepared from each. Of the two
plates from the exposed <U+FB02>ask, one plate—a l-drop plate of a 1/10th
dilution—yielded no colonies at all; the other gave 21,941 per c.c.,
pointing to a profound light-action.
   Of the two plates from the darkened <U+FB02>ask, one gave 5,400,000,
and the other 5,000,000 as the nearest estimate per c.c.
   The two <U+FB02>asks meanwhile stood over-night in the laboratory at
18° C. for about fourteen hours, and at 7 A.M. next day (September 4)
I made two plates from the exposed <U+FB02>ask and then again put them out
as before.
     These two plates      gave 42,000 and 59,220 respectively;          total,
101,220    ;   mean, 50,610 bacteria per c.c., a prefectly natural rise in the
 numbers having occurred during the night.
                                                              I
   N 0 plates were taken from the other <U+FB02>ask, as had no particular
need for the numbers—known         to be very high—and wished to
reserve the counting for other plates.
   After exposure to the bright sunshine of September 4, from 8 to
4.30, say eight houl‘s’ sunshine on the exposed <U+FB02>ask, two new plates
were made from each <U+FB02>ask.
   The two plates from exposed <U+FB02>ask gave 3050 and 4200; total,
7250; mean, 3625 bacteria per c.c., again showing a marked reduc
tion in the sunlight, and the plates were singularly free of liquefying
centres, but showed many colonies of the kind             I
                                                    had previously sus
pected as being the representatives of          ,8.
   Of the two plates from the unexposed <U+FB02>ask, although made from
one drop each of a 1/20th dilution, the numbers were again so large
and the liquefaction so rapid that no reliance can be placed on them,
except that they prove that no essential diminution was to be traced
to the action of the water or temperature in the absence of light, but
only the natural fall in numbers always found when water stands for
some time. The numbers actually calculated Were 660,000 and
3,300,000; total, 3,960,000; mean, 1,980,000 per c.c.
   The <U+FB02>asks stood in the laboratory at 18° C. through the night, and
I repeated the exposure on September       putting the uncovered <U+FB02>ask
                                                 5,

                    <U+FB02>ask  1] (2) was exposed    over and in front of plane mirrors.
                       A plate from each <U+FB02>ask at the beginning gave respectively 1,470,144
                    and 1,699,360     total, 3,169,504; mean, 1,584,752, as the number of

                       The <U+FB02>asks were out from 10 A.M. to 4.30 P.M., the day being beauti
                    fully bright with a hot sun and blue sky. The temperature in the
                    covered <U+FB02>ask rose to 33° C. in the afternoon, that in the exposed

           one to about                   34:0   0., as shown by controls with thermometers in the
           water.
             Two    samples of the water of the unexposed      <U+FB02>ask, taken at
           4.30 P,M. on September 5, gave 1,575,860 and 1,285,388 as the num
           bers per c.c.; total, 2,861,248; mean, 1,430,624 per c.c., suggesting
         that the sojourn in distilled water at that temperature, even in the
         dark, causes the death of large numbers of this bacillus.
             Of two samples taken at 4.30 from the <U+FB02>ask 17 (2), which had been
         exposed for six and a half hours, neither plate gave any sign of life
         after ten days‘ incubation, whence we mayr assume that neither
         sample contained a living germ.
             These two <U+FB02>asks were put in a cool cupboard over-night—temper
         ature = 15° C.—and again put out on the 6th September from 9.30
         to 4.30, so that the exposed <U+FB02>ask—97 (2)—received another good six
         hours of bright sun, for the day was brilliantly <U+FB01>ne again.
             After the exposure, a plate was made from each <U+FB02>ask. That from
          :7 (2), the one exposed    to the sun, gave no signs of life though incu
       .
         bated    for ten days ; the  other showed 560,000 per c.c.
             It seems probable, therefore, that in the case of Bacillus 07 the im
         mersion in sterile water at 33—34!o 0., even in the dark, is more or less
         fatal, for we see the bacteria are reduced from over a million and a
         half per c.c. to nearly half a million per c.c. At the same time it
         seems pretty clear that when exposed to light at the same time the
         mortality of the bacilli is much greater.      The inference appears fair,
          but there is naturally some dissatisfaction to be felt with these
         negative results.                                                \

                                               §  XVIII.
        On August 20, two Erlenmeyer <U+FB02>asks, labelled F1 and F2, were
    charged to a depth of about an inch with sterile-distilled water with
    which a loopful of spores of B. anthracis had been thoroughly shaken
    up.    Flask F, was exposed with a mirror below and one behind; F2
    was wrapped in foil and black paper.
        The exposure was from 11.30 A.M. to 5 P.M., but it was a windy
    and cloudy day, with a good deal of rain.                   Just before exposure, two
    plates were made to determine the number of spores introduced per
    c.c. in the <U+FB02>ask F1.               One plate gave 1,950,000,               and the other
    2,445,000 ; total, 4,395,000; mean, 2,197,500 per c.c.
        Two plates from F2 gave respectively 2,052,000 and 2,280,000;
    total, 4,332,000; mean, 2,166,000.
        Or, if we take the average of the four plates, we get total =
    8,727,000; average of the four = 2,181,750; and it will be noticed
    how well the four plates agreed.
        At 5.30 P.M. two plates were made from the covered <U+FB02>ask, and gave
    per c.c. 1,700,000 and 340,000 respectively.                     It was noted, however,
    that the second plate had been badly levelled, and the colonies were
    heaped up to one side, and could not be properly estimated.                         Taking
    the numbers as they stand, we get total = 2,040,000; mean =
    1,020,000      per c.c., indicating some reduction, but still enormously
    high numbers present.
        Two plates from the exposed <U+FB02>ask F2, after the <U+FB01>ve and a half
    hours’ insolation, gave 595,000 and 1,295,000 ; total, 1,890,000; mean,

   This seemed to show that the exposure to what was, after all,   only
diifused light, had very little e<U+FB01>ect in <U+FB01>ve and a half hours.
   Both <U+FB02>asks were taken in at 5.30, and put on ice for the night at
6 P.M.. and  remained on ice till 11 A.M. on the 21st, i.e., seventeen
hours in dark and on ice. They were then put out again from
11.15 A.M. to 4 P.M., the weather being much brighter, though plenty
of white cumulus clouds kept sweeping over the sun.
   Before putting out, two plates were made from each <U+FB02>ask at
11.30 A.M. on the 21st.    Those from F1 (unexposed) gave 1,149,000
and 646,000;     total, 1,795,000;   mean, 897,500 ; numbers very
similar to those of the previous day, and indicating that no essen
tial changes had occurred on the ice——possibly a few had succumbed
to the rapid cooling.
   The two plates from the exposed <U+FB02>ask F, gave 42,000 and
 1,200,000—the last number being too high, as there were numerous
invading forms on the plate rendering it dif<U+FB01>cult to count. Taking
the <U+FB01>gures as they stand we have, total, 1,242,000; mean, 621,000,
which is a reduction on last night’s <U+FB01>gures.
   After exposure on the 21st, two plates were again made from
each <U+FB02>ask, with the following results.
   Of the two plates from the exposed <U+FB02>ask F1, one gave 122,500,
and the other 50,750 as the maximum numbers per 0.0. Total,
173,250; mean, 86,625 per c.c.
   While the unexposed <U+FB02>ask gave 1,920,000 and 640. The last low
number was obviously due to some blunder; but, even if we take it
to reduce the average, we get total, 1,920,640; mean, 960,320 per c.c.
   After exposure, the <U+FB02>asks were again put on ice at 9 P.M., and
remained there till 12 noon next day, ‘i.6., August 22; they had
been at 16° C. in the interval from 4.30 RM. to 9 RM.
   On the 22nd a plate was taken from each <U+FB02>ask at 2.30 to 3 P.M.,
and the F1 gave no anthrax colonies at all, though nursed for nearly
a week.   The other <U+FB02>ask gave 990 colonies, which comes to 297,000
per c.c.
   On the 23rd, after another seven and a half hours’l exposure,
plates were again made, one from each, and gave the following num
bers—the exposed <U+FB02>ask 2 colonies, which = 720 per c.c., and shows
that all spores were not yet killed, and the unexposed one 20 colo
nies, which = 6800 per c.c.
   Unfortunately we were compelled to abandon these <U+FB02>asks now;
the mere labour of counting within the necessary periods the numer
ous plates we were making made it imperative that this series should
be discontinued.    I am now particularly sorry this was so, because
it would have been interesting to <U+FB01>nd       if,
                                             and when, the light abso
lutely cleared the water of spores.   However, we could not foresee
what the tabular a—ésumé brings out so clearly. (Table 0.)

                   Report on the Bacteriology of lVater.             361
    A point of great importance arises here—not for the <U+FB01>rst time,
 but very vividly.      That is the gradual, and much slower, but,
 nevertheless,    determined reduction of the spores, even in the dark
 <U+FB02>ask.    I   am convinced that the principal factor in this is the
 changes    in  temperature undergone by the water, which was warmed
 up to 30° 0., or thereabouts, during the day, and cooled to 4° 0r
 5° 0., or even lower, during its stay on ice.
                                  § XIX.
    The following experiment (Table P) gives an excellent example of
 how much can be done by the clear sun of a hot summer day in
                                                         '
 clearing the water of living spores of anthrax.
    A quantity of anthrax spores were carefully rubbed up in about
 50 0.0. of sterile-distilled water, on August 16, and the infected
 water distributed into two Erlenmeyer <U+FB02>asks, marked Am and Bx.
    Are was exposed to the sun, with a mirror below and behind, from
 10 A.M. to 4 P.M., and the sun during the whole period was brilliant.
Bx was placed beside Aw, but carefully shut in an opaque wooden
box.
    A sample plate was taken from each <U+FB02>ask before exposure, and,
after twenty-<U+FB01>ve and a half hours’ incubation at 22—25° 0., gave the
following numbers. Plate from Ax = 23,000 colonies = 897,000
per -c.c., the plate beginning to liquefy. Plate from Bx, after the
same incubation, was already in an advanced stage of liquefaction,
but we satis<U+FB01>ed ourselves of at least 5000 visible colonies = 170,000
per 0.0. Total of the two, 1,067,000; mean, 533,500, as the minimum
                              '
number per 0.0.
    At 4.15 to 4.30 P.M., after six hours’ bright insolation of the ex
posed plate, two sample plates were taken from each <U+FB02>ask.
    Those from Aw (exposed) gave 117 and 40 colonies respectively
as the maximum numbers we could discover after 72% hours’ incuba
tion, beyond which we could not carry the process.         The counting
was done twice every day, and every colony actually marked. These
numbers give us 4563 and 1360 per 0.0. as the maximum; total =
5923; mean = 2961 per 0.0.                                      -
   On the two plates from But (not exposed) we found at least 5900
and 6600 respectively, after repeated countings of all the squares.
Moreover, these numbers were obtained in forty-eight and a half
hours, the liquefaction being so pronounced later that we could not
count further.       We thus get a minimum of 200,600 and 228,400 per

        energetic than has been commonly supposed, and the results also
        suggest that some spores die off very quickly, even in the dark, when
        put into sterile water-—a fact long known.
            On August 18, we started a similar experiment to the last, using
        Thames water, freshly collected, instead of sterilised distilled water ;
        but this had to be abandoned owing to the di<U+FB01>iculties with the
        rapidly-developing liquefying forms at the temperatures necessary
        for growing the anthrax. There was nothing in the results to con
        tradict previous experience, but the details are of little value.

         of colonies B—from gelatine stab-culture—from                               9 A.M. to 44 P.M.

         wrapped in foil and black paper,                 and  placed by       the  side    of the   above.
            At 4 P.M. a plate was made from each tube, and incubated at
         15° C. ; a stab-culture from each was also made and kept at 15° C.,

                 and   quite visible to the unaided eye, the larger ones opening out
                 and   swarming vigorously as liquefaction began.     A greenish shim
                 mer  showed where the colonies were very dense. In sixty-four hours
                 the  colonies were running together, and liquefying rapidly, and in
                 eighty-six hours the whole gelatine was liquid and watery.
                   The plate from the insolated tube, treated in exactly the same
                 way, showed' no trace of colonies in forty hours, and only one or two
                minute colonies, invisible to the unaided eye, could be detected under
                the microscope in sixty-four hours.        Even after seven days the
                morula-like, 'dense, granular colonies only showed traces of opening
                out and the <U+FB01>rst beginnings of liquefaction.
                   Of the stab-cultures, that from the covered tube showed the
                beginnings of growth in forty hours, and had formed thistle-head                             a
                funnel of liquefaction in sixty-four hours, which rapidly extended
                in eighty-eight hours.
                   That from the insolated tube, on the contrary, showed no trace
                of growth in forty hours, or even in sixty-four hours to eighty-eight
                hours.
                   Of course      may be objected that the difference here was entirely
                                      it
                due  to  the stab-infection having carried in so few living germs in
                the latter case; but to this     must be replied, that the plates show

clearly that the individual colonies are weakened by the light-action,
and the results with the original tubes (given below) may also be
consulted.
   Turning now to the original broth cultures, placed at 20—22° C.
In eighteen hours the darkened tube was distinctly turbid, whereas
that exposed to the sun was perfectly clear; and the same was the
case at the end of forty hours.        In sixty-four hours both tubes
were turbid, but the exposed one far less so than the other. Later
on   it   was impossible to distinguish between    them.
     It
      seems to me impossible to avoid the conclusion that the light
action so weakens the metabolism of the insolated cells that they
grow and divide more slowly, and dissolve the gelatine-more feebly,
and possibly this weakening eifect is transmitted to the cells to
which they give rise by division.   As time passes, however, the cells
gradually recover their vigour in the dark, and where plenty of food
material is accessible.
   That this latter statement is true the following experiment
proves :—On October 18         I
                              took the two broth-tubes of Colony              [-3,
referred to above, both of which had been in the dark, side by
side, since October 6.      Broth-tubes were exactly similar at the
beginning, as we have seen, but one of them had' been exposed, on
October     for seven hours to the sunlight.
             6,
   On making stab-cultures from these tubes, no difference could be
detected between their behaviour, both began to liquefy the gelatine
in forty-eight hours in the typical, thistle-head funnel form.
   This seems to show clearly, also, that the broth has not been in
jured as a medium for culture by its exposure to light.
   In order to meet the objection that the above results were due
to the using of broth-cultures,       I     repeated      them as follows' on
October 10 :—                                   I
   Two tubes of sterile water, infected from the turbid broth-culture
kept in the dark since October          6, were suspended, as already de
scribed—one exposed      over a  mirror  to  the bright direct sunlight from
10 AJI. to    P.M., the other wrapped up, and placed beside it. At
               2
2 RM. plates and stab-cultures were made from each tube.
   The results were the same as before.             The plates from the unex
posed  tubes  showed   numerous    liquefying     colonies  in forty-eight hours,
and were completely lique<U+FB01>ed on the third day; the plates from the
insolated tube showed only very few colonies, and these not till the
third day, and they were denser, more granular,'and without any
signs of liquefaction for several days.           To take a concrete case: a
plate made with drop  1       (1
                               /30 c.c.)  from    the dark tube showed about
5000 colonies in forty-eight hours, and these were already beginning
to run; the whole of the gelatine was lique<U+FB01>ed in another twenty
four hours; the corresponding plate made with              1    drop (1/24 c.c.)

from the insolated tube showed three colonies only on the third day,
and these were very small, more densely granular, and irregular in
outline than the normal colonies, and showed no traces of liquo
faction even on the fourth day. On the <U+FB01>fth day the liquefaction
was beginning, but even after fourteen days one of the three colo
                                                             '
nies was only just breaking up.
   The stab-cultures gave similar results.     Those from the darkened
tube showed a distinct thistle-head funnel of liquefaction in three
days, whereas the feeblest signs that infection had really occurred
were all I could get in the same time from the insolated cultures.
   Here, again, however, the two sets of tubes gradually become
alike, evidently because the at <U+FB01>rst enfeebled cells gradually re~
gain their vigour, and once more rapidly peptonise the medium.
   The experiments with water were repeated on October 12, all the
arrangements being as before.
   The exposed tube was out from 9 A.M. to 3 P.M. in brilliant sun
shine the whole time practically.
   After three hours’ exposure, a plate was. made. That from the
dark tube showed colonies, visible only under the microscope, in
nineteen hours, and in two days the whole of the gelatine was
liquid like water.
   The plate from the lighted tube showed no signs until the third
day ; on the fourth day six colonies had made their appearance, but
these only began to soften the gelatine around some days later, and
even on the twelfth day two of the six colonies were still circular
depressions, though the other four had lique<U+FB01>ed the gelatine some
distance round.
   After six hours’ exposure, further plates were made from the above
tub'es on October 12.
   As before, colonies were visible with the lens on the plate made
from the dark tube in sixteen hours, and before the end of the second
day the whole of the gelatine was lique<U+FB01>ed like water.
   On the plate from the light tube <U+FB01>ve slowly-developing colonies
had appeared by the fourth day, one of which showed feeble signs of
liquefaction next day. But even after twelve days only three of
these colonies were- vigorously liquefying the gelatine, the other two
being still compact and circular, though one of them lay in a slight
depression.                           .
   Stab-cultures were also made at the end of the six hours’ exposure
on October 12, with the results as before.    In the case of the culture
from the dark tube, the funnel of liquefaction had reached the walls
of the tube, and lique<U+FB01>ed one-eighth of an inch of gelatine in four
days, whereas that from the lighted tube, in the same period and
side by side, had not even begun to liquefy the gelatine, though the
infection had taken.

                    Report on the Bacteriology   of Water.                  369
  I  also, at the end of the experiment on October 12, cautiously
emptied each of the water tubes, and drained it until only a drop
remained, and then <U+FB01>lled up with sterile broth. After sixteen hours
the dark tube was distinctly turbid, whereas no trace of turbidity
appeared in the insolated one till after forty-eight hours. Both were
                                                              ‘
equally turbid on the fourth day.
  Of course     I
                recognise that this last result, and that obtained with
the stab-cultures, is attributable to the numbers of still living germs
added to the gelatine and broth respectively, and the experiments
only go to prove once more, but in a very decisive manner, what
mortality the sun had occasioned in the exposed tubewfor we must
remember, each tube contained practically the same enormous num
bers at the start.
                                   §   xxr.
   On October 6 a loopful of a markedly liquefying form, marked
in my   notes as colony 0, was placed in each of two tubes of broth, and
placed in the sun from 9 A.M. to 41 RM. One tube was exposed over a
mirror, the other side by side, but wrapped in foil and black paper.
The sun shone brightly from 9 to 1, and then was obscured by clouds.
   At 4! RM. :1. plate and a stab-culture from each tube were made, and
the tubes put at 20° to 22° C. in the dark incubator.        The plate and
stab-cultures were put at 15° C. in the dark.
   Taking the broth tubes <U+FB01>rst. Both were already turbid in eighteen
hours, more densely so after forty hours, so that no di<U+FB01>erence between
them could be detected.
   Of the stab-cultures, that from the dark tube had taken in forty
hours, while the one from the lighted tube showed no signs.
   In sixty-four hours the non-illuminated culture had developed a
thistle-head liquefaction funnel, whereas no trace was visible in the
other. In eighty-eight hours the liquefaction had proceeded rapidly
in the former tube; only one feeble colony was visible in the tube
from the insolated broth. In the course of a week or so IO further
di<U+FB01>erence could be made out.
   With regard to the plates.      That from the insolated tube showed
no trace until sixty-four hours had passed, when two or three colonies
% to  *1- mm. diameter were seen.        In eighty-six hours these were
somewhat like young anthrax colonies, each with       a  slight depression.
On the sixth day liquefaction of the gelatine         was  slowly evincing
itself.
   The plate from the dark tube showed evident colonies,       %  to    and
                                                                       %,
even  1  mm. in diameter, in forty hours; and in sixty-four hours they
averaged    2to    mm. in diameter, and were liquefying rapidly.

same time, however,       and whiter in colour. In eighty-eight hours the
whole of the gelatine was completely lique<U+FB01>ed.
                                   § XXII.
      On October 30 about 200 0.0. of sterilised Thames water were
strongly infected with the bacillus called B. arborescens by Frank
land, taken from a vigorous culture.
     The infected liquid was divided equally into two Erlenmeyer
<U+FB02>asks, one of which was at once wrapped in tin-foil and black paper.
The other was supported above a plane mirror, and placed so as to
obtain the maximum amount of direct sunshine available from 10 AJI.
to 5 P.M. that day; from 10 to 1 the sunshine was hot and bright,
and a control <U+FB02>ask showed that the water rose to nearly 20° C., but
the afternoon was dull and cloudy, and the temperature fell to 12° C.
The temperature in the covered <U+FB02>ask, placed side by side with the
exposed one, rose and fell so nearly exactly with that of the latter, I
that no stress can be laid on the difference.
      Before commencing the experiment at 10 A.M., sample plates were
made of the infected water; and at 5 RM. two plates were made from
 each <U+FB02>ask—exposed and unexposed.
      The plates from the freshly infected material showed the usual
 rapidly growing, loose, thread-like colonies in forty-eight hours, and
 in three days the gelatine was entirely lique<U+FB01>ed to a watery <U+FB02>uid.
      The plates from the <U+FB02>ask, wrapped in foil and paper, and sheltered
 from the direct rays of the sun, behav'ed similarly, the colonies being
 a tri<U+FB02>e more compact in shape, but equally rapid in liquefying the
 gelatine completely.
      But the plates from the exposed <U+FB02>ask differed from the <U+FB01>rst
 onwards from those not insolated. Thus no colonies were visible in
 forty-eight hours, a period during which the plates from the un
  exposed <U+FB02>asks exhibited numerous typical colonies; the colonies
  appeared here twenty-four hours later, clearly showing the effects of
  inhibition due to the light.
       Secondly, when the colonies did make their appearance they were
  more compact, and instead of shooting out in all directions and
  covering the plate with a meshwork of <U+FB01>ne branches, rapidly lique
   fying the gelatine, as in the case of the uueXposed specimens, the
   mode of growth was so affected that on the fourth day they had
   developed into beautifully circular yellowish colonies, zoned, and
   radially striated, and only just softening the gelatine. It was not,
   indeed, till the sixth day that liquefaction set in generally.
       I explain the differences as follows. The light retards the growth
   of the living bacilli, owing to some action on their protoplasm which
    induces interference with the metabolic processes on which growth

                 Report on  the Bacteriology of Water.                371
depends   ; this causes the cell-chains to be so modi<U+FB01>ed in length,
direction,  and  rapidity of development, that the colony formed from
the insulated germ is weaker and more condensed, or compact, than
normally.     Thus result the differences in the naked eye characters of
the colonies, which may go so far that the total aspect on the gelatine
plate is altered.
   Some clue to the action may perhaps be got eventually by following
up the fact that one consequence of the light action is to weaken the
enzyme action of the bacterium—for the enfeebled liquefying power
is an expression of enfeebled enzyme power—either by so altering the
protoplasmic machinery that less enzyme is secreted, or by so acting
on the enzyme that its power of converting the medium is altered.
The lessened enzyme power of course implies less power to obtain its
food from the medium, and so the progeny developed from the germ
started with are also feebler than the normal one.
   In the cases quoted, however, the colony gradually becomes more
normal as regards its enzyme power, especially in the dark, because
the successively developed new cells become stronger and stronger as
they are fed by the nutrient gelatine, and at last the differences are
equalised.                                            ‘
   The only source of error in the above conclusion that    I could think
of, was the possibility that the rapid running of the colonies into
thin <U+FB01>laments in the <U+FB01>rst case is facilitated by the quicker liquefac
tion of the gelatine, and that this liquefaction is, in turn, more rapid,
because there are so many more colonies per drop in the unexposed
<U+FB02>asks, because the majority of the bacilli in the exposed <U+FB02>asks are
killed.
   I accordingly   made plates in which   I diluted the samples from the
unexposed     <U+FB02>asks <U+FB01>ve, ten, and even     twenty times as much as the
samples from the exposed <U+FB02>asks, and so brought the numbers of
colonies on each plate approximately equal.         Of course it may he
replied here that the diiferences of dilution may bring about diffe
rences in development; but experience shows that increased dilution
tends to inhibition of colonies, and so   I                     I
                                            think the fact that still get
the differences in the colonies already described, strengthens rather
than weakens the evidence that the alteration in the character of the
colonies from exposed <U+FB02>asks is really due to the action of the light.
   On November 7, which turned out a beautifully <U+FB01>ne day, with
clear blue sky and bright sun, tubes of sterile distilled water were
infected with cultures of a yellow bacillus marked *, a large white
 one marked (->, and a violet bacillus, common in the Thames. In each
 case, two similar tubes were prepared, exactly alike, one of which was
 exposed over a mirror, from 10.30 A.M. to 3.30 P.M.; while the other
was wrapped in foil and black paper, and placed by the side of the ex
posed one. The temperature recorded in control tubes was lO—I2° C.

on the 13th—t'.e., after six days—three colonies were seen.      These
remained white until December 1, when one of them began to show
the violet line.    On December 6 this was more pronounced.
   The experiment, therefore, showed negative results only, and       I
regard it as probable that the mere immersion in water injures the
bacillus. On the other hand, it is possible   I did not use suf<U+FB01>cient
material in making the plates.
   Thus the plates of exposed tube = 1/28th c.c. of 7/28 dilution, and
that of dark one = l/27th c.c. of 1/27 dilution, thus giving only
2187 per c.c. even in the unexposed tube, making it probable that the
last suggestion is the right one.
   Now, as regards the yellow bacillus, Colony *. Of the two plates
made from the insolated tube, one was contaminated, and yielded no
results, except that plenty of colonies appeared; the other failed
utterly. The plate from the dark tube showed innumerable typical
colonies, and was completely lique<U+FB01>ed on the fourth day.
   The experiments consequently must be regarded as negative.
   The plates of Colony Q behaved as follows. That from the dark
tube gave a typical series of colonies—about 500 = 500 X 28 X 28 =
392,000 per c.c., softening the gelatine in two days.
   That from the lighted tube gave far fewer—about 100 X 25 X 5 =
12,500 per c.c.—colonies, and these smaller, showing evident retard
ation; otherwise no results.
   On N Ovember 12 the above experiment was repeated with Colony *,
Colony    71.,
            and the rosy-red bacillus   5, exactly as before.  The day
was cold and bright, though some haze appeared after      1   PM. Ex
posure 10.30 to 3.30 as before, and thermometers = 10—12° C.
   The plates of Colony-i" behaved as follows. That from the dark
tube was lique<U+FB01>ed by numerous colonies, which appeared on the
second day.    On the fourth day all the gelatine was lique<U+FB01>ed.
   The plates (two) made from the insolated tube only showed slight
retardation, and lique<U+FB01>ed also on the fourth day, though more slowly.
   No difference between illuminated and dark tubes could be made
out in the case of Colony     <U+FB02>,
                               except slight retardation on the plates
from the former.
   The results with Colony     8were still more indecisive, and
                                                              I   could
not draw any conclusions as to distinct light action.
   It appears probable that cOnsiderable differences will be found
 between the various forms in this respect.

                                § XXIII.
   In the following tables  I give the determinations of the numbers
of all bacteria found in three series of analyses of samples of Thames
water in August, October, and December, 1893.            As will be seen,
they con<U+FB01>rm    the results of other  observers,  in so far that they show
that the number per c.c. is considerably greater in winter than in
summer.
   There is nothing special to note as regards the methods employed,
which were those ordinarily in use, beyond the fact that we counted
every colony on each plate, instead of estimating the averages from a
few squares.                                                        -
   The greatest care was taken to have the gelatine made up exactly
alike in every case; further information as to details is supplied by
the tables.

  Quantitative Analysis of Thames Water in August, 1893 (Table Q).
   If we analyse these August numbers, we get as the average of
14 two-days’ plates, 1157; of 241 three-days’ plates, we have 1530; of
15 four-days’ plates, we have 2208; of 8 <U+FB01>ve-days’ plates, we get
3575; and of 8 six-days’ plates, we have 3037, as the approximate
averages.    Of course these numbers can only be regarded as approxi
mations, but    I  think they are of use as indicating what might be
looked for if the necessary large series of observations could be made
over several years ; and they certainly serve to put us on our guard
against placing too much con<U+FB01>dence in the gelatine method unless a
great number of observations are made, extending over a long period.
Of course the great dif<U+FB01>culty to be contended against is that of
keeping the plates long enough; if only one badly liquefying form is
present, it ruins the plates before the slowly developing ones germi
nate out.
   Quantitative Analysis of Thames Water in October, 1893 (Table R).
   The following table gives the details of the analysis for October,
and again    I have recorded all the points.       The chief feature or
interest is the much longer time during which the plates could be
cultivated, in spite of the prevalence of liquefying forms, where care
was taken to dilute suf<U+FB01>ciently.

384          Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
           Quantitative Analyst's of Thames Water   in December.
   On December 27, 1893, a cloudy and misty cold morning following
on a series of bright sunny cold days, a sample of Thames water was
taken at 11 A.M., and immediately conveyed to the laboratory, and
plates made as follows.        The water on collection was at nearly
8° C.
    Twenty-two plates in all were made, of which twelve were in
cubated at 8—12° C., the temperature of the laboratory, and ten at
l8—20° O. in the incubator.        There were a good many changes of
temperature from day to day       in  the case of the former, though but
slight and slow alterations in the latter case.
    The following tables give the results of the plate cultures, every
colony visible with the hand lens being counted each day as before ;
and this time the low temperature cultures were continued for
240 hours (ten days), in order to see how far the numbers would
eventually approximate to those of the higher temperature plates.
    An innovation was made in the case of the plates marked Rle,
8.8., Tsz.      Here I used 1 drop of the Thames water between each
pair of plates.      The drop was allowed to fall as usual into the tube
of gelatine, then a second tube of sterile gelatine emptied into the
infected tube; then the contents were distributed rapidly into two
plates, the countings of which must be taken together as is done in
the table.    It is noteworthy how much higher the <U+FB01>nal numbers are
in these plates as compared with others, no doubt chie<U+FB02>y owing to
the more complete separation of the bacteria from which the colonies
 arise, and to their having more space to develops in.

                   Report on the Bacteriology   of Water.                391
   In  the following plates  I have plotted the curves obtained from the
means    of the foregoing illustrative series of analyses.     They bring
out very clearly the differences in numbers referred to, and I am
strongly of opinion that much valuable information would result
from a systematic series of monthly analyses of the Thames water
conducted along these lines.
   I by no means pretend that the numbers themselves are of abso~
lute value, any more than are those obtained by the ordinary
methods of counting averages ; but      I do think that the selected cases
suggest possible lines of departure for the systematic bacteriological
analysis of such a river as the Thames, if a suf<U+FB01>cient number of other
data were taken in at the same time.        These data should include at
least the following : (I) the temperature of the river, (2) the amount
of sunshine,        the organic analysis of the water, (4) the rainfall.
   I am perfectly alive to the incompleteness of the above analyses in
these respects, and they are only intended to show what I think
should be done by a competent sta<U+FB01> of assistants, if any attempt is
made at a thorough investigation of the bacteriology of the Thames!
and the same applies to any other water.
   The particular object of the above analyses was to test the view
that the actual number of bacteria present in winter is less than that
in summer, and they strongly con<U+FB01>rm that; and if we remember that
this was so in 1893 in spite of (1) the river being lower in August,
and therefore more concentrated as a food liquid, (2) the temperature
being higher, and therefore more favourable to bacterial growth, it
seems at least highly probable that the diminution in the bacteria is
largely due to the increased insolation.
   Nor is this all (though I defer the fuller consideration of this
point) that my analyses suggest.      I <U+FB01>nd very distinct evidence that
the bacteria in the summer water are many of them enfeebled forms,
suggesting a distinct inhibition or weakening of their powers of
growth.      In some cases it is certain that forms obtained in August,
and which afterwards turned out to be identical with forms found in.
the winter, at <U+FB01>rst grew so feebly that their characters on the plates
led one to put them down as distinct species or varieties.
   I  have given some experimental evidence bearing on this, and
going to prove that it is due to the action of light on these forms.
The matter is a very complex one, and I must refrain from further
discussion of it until all the forms isolated during the year are worked
out; but it is worth while, I think, to draw the attention of investi
gators to the matter.       In one or two cases, at least, there is no
question    that  exposure to light does so affect the germination and
growth of the bacteria, that the resulting colonies depart widely
from the normal in many of their characters.
   I have in hand a large number of experimental results obtained

392          Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
from the detailed investigation of a single species and the measure
ment of the growth of a- single <U+FB01>lament (watched continuously under
the microscope) under different conditions of exposure; they have
been incidentally referred to in my lecture at the Royal Institution,
in May, 1894, and I shall hope to bring them before the Royal Society
shortly.    They prove still more conclusively at least the main point,
that exposure to sunlight does materially affect the rate and manner
of growth, &c., of a bacterium rodlet or <U+FB01>lament, as well as the
germinal power of the spores.
   As regards further details on the action of light on the spores and
bacilli, I may refer the Committee to my memoir, now in the hands
of the Royal Society, an abstract of which appeared in the ‘ Pro
ceedings,’  V01. 54, p. 472.

 “ The Behaviour of the Typhoid Bacillus and of the Bacillus
       Coll Commum's in Potable Water.” By PERCY F RANKLAND,
       Ph.D., 13.80. (Loud), F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry in
       Mason College, Birmingham, assisted by             J. R. APPLE-YARD,
       F.C.S.
   It   has already been pointed out in the previous Reports that the
 only  two  zymotic diseases which have been conclusively proved to be
 communicable, and frequently communicated by drinking water, are
 Asiatic cholera and typhoid fever. The behaviour in water of the
 particular micro-organisms which are almost universally credited
with the power of exciting these speci<U+FB01>c maladies is obviously, there
fore, one of the most interesting and important questions in the
whole domain of the hygiene of water supply.
   Inasmuch as Asiatic cholera is, fortunately, only an occasional
visitor of these islands, or, indeed, of the continent of Europe, the
investigation of this question with regard to this disease is certainly
of less immediate consequence than_is its investigation with regard
to typhoid fever, which we have always with us, and which claims
such a large number of victims annually from amongst our popula
tion.                                   .
   In the present Report      I  have, therefore, endeavoured on the one
hand to summarise brie<U+FB02>y what has already been done by others
towards the elucidation of this subject 'of the behaviour of the
typhoid bacillus in water, whilst on the other hand          I have recorded
those experiments which        I  have myself conducted with a view to
extending the knowledge of this matter in general, and in respect
to the conditions of water-supply pertaining to this country in par
ticular.
   Our information concerning the behaviour of the typhoid bacillus
in water is of essentially two different kinds; <U+FB01>rstly, this bacillus
has on a number of occasions been discovered with more or less
certainty in waters which were actually being used for domestic pur
poses, and to which it had therefore gained access unintentionally
and in the natural course of events ; secondly, the bacillus has been
purposely introduced into various waters in which its subsequent fate
has then been traced by experimental observation. It will be con
venient to consider these two

396             Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
           1. Discovery   of the Typhoid Bacillus in Natural Waters.
   Inasmuch as the communicability of typhoid fever by drinking
water has been long recognised as a cardinal principle of modern
hygiene, it was only natural that the discovery of the speci<U+FB01>c
micro-organism of this disease by Eberth should have been soon
followed by strenuous efforts to discover the Eberth-bacillns in
potable water; it was not until about six years afterwards, however,
that successful attempts in this direction were announced.
   The <U+FB01>rst investigator who claimed to have discovered Eberth
Gaffky’s bacillus in water was Moers (“ Die Brunnen der Stadt Miihl
heim a. Rhein vom bakteriologischem Standpunkte ans betrachtet,"
  Ergiinzungsh. zum Centralblatt f. allgem. Gesundheitsp<U+FB01>ege,’ vol. ii,
‘
1886, p. 144), who isolated the bacillus from a contaminated well
supplying drinking water to a number of people amongst whom
many cases of typhoid fever had occurred.
   This discovery was soon followed by a similar announcement from
Michael (“ Typhusbacillen im Trinkwasser,” ‘ Fortschritte d. Medicin,’
 vol. iv, 1886, p. 353), in Dresden, who claimed to have isolated the
bacillus from a well-water which was suspected of being the source of
 an outbreak of typhoid which declared itself at the end of the year
1885.
    Dreyfus-Brisac    and Widal (“ Epidémie de Famille de Fievrc
typhoide,” ‘Gaz. hebdom.,’ 1886, N o. 45) again detected the bacilli in
the polluted water of a well at Ménilmontant, where typhoid fever
had been prevalent for some months.
    The typhoid bacillus has repeatedly been found in the water of the
river Seine, thus Chantemesse and Widal (‘Graz. hebdom. de Méd. et
de Chirurg.,’1887, pp. 146—150; ‘ Oentralbl. f. Bakteriol.,’ vol. i, 1887,
p. 682) discovered the bacillus no less than three times in this water
during an outbreak of typhoid in Paris. Thoinot (‘La Semaine
Médicale,’ 1887, No. 14, p. 135; ‘Centralbl. f. Bakteriol.,’ vol.      ii,
                                                                     1887,
p. 39) also isolated typhoid bacilli from the Seine at Ivry, at a dis
 tance of but little more than twenty yards from the point where the
 water      abstracted for the occasional supply of Paris with drinking
           is
 water. Again, Loir (“Recherche du Bacille typhique dans les Eaux
 d’Alimentation de la Ville de Paris,” ‘Annales de l’Institut Pasteur,’
 vol. i, p. $88) detected the typhoid bacillus in Seine water which was
  actually being distributed to a portion of Paris during the summer
  of 1887, owing to the scarcity of the Vanne water, which yields the
  supply under ordinary circumstances. Vincent (“Présence du Bacille
  typhique dans l’Eau de Seine pendant 1e Mois de Juillet, 1890,"
   Annales de l’lnstitut Pasteur,’ vol. iv, p. 772) again found the
‘
  typhoid bacillus in the Seine water which was being similarly sup
  plied to Paris during the summer of 1890.

       Beumer (“ Zur Aetiologie d. Typhus abdominalis,” ‘Deutsche
    medicinische Wochenschrift,’ 1887, No. 28) was able to detect the
    typhoid bacillus in a well-water used for drinking purposes in a
    country place near Greifswald, where an outbreak of typhoid had
    occurred.                  V
       A similar discovery of the bacillus was made by Brouardel and
    Chantemesse (“Enquéte sur les Causes de l’Epidémie de Fievre
    typhoide qui a régné a Clermont-Ferrand,”            ‘Annales d’Hygiene
    publique  et de Médecine   légale,’ vol. xvii, 1887,   pp. 385—403 ; also
    ‘Revue d’Hygiene,’ vol.   ix,  p. 368) in the course of an investiga
    tion of an epidemic of typhoid which prevailed at Clermont-Ferrand,
    and in which neighbouring places using the same water supply were
    also involved.
       Finkelnburg (“Ueber einen Befund von Typhusbacillen im Brun
    nenwasser,” ‘ Centralbl. f. Bakteriol.,’ vol. ix, p. 301) states that he
    isolated the typhoid bacillus from a well which had in all probability
    been contaminated with typhoid dej ecta.

    a Belgian village during an epidemic of typhoid fever.

‘
   Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,’ 1888 ; ‘ Centralbl. f. Bakteriol.’
vol. iv, 1888, p. 467) states that out of 2000 samples of water which
he had examined bacteriologically, there were only <U+FB01>ve in which he
was able to detect typhoid bacilli.
    From the above it will be seen that many investigators, since the
year 1886, claim to have discovered the typhoid bacillus in potable
waters, but, in the majority of cases, these discoveries, especially the
earlier ones, must be accepted with considerable reserve, as, until
recently, it was customary to rely for the identi<U+FB01>cation of the typhoid
bacillus on altogether insuf<U+FB01>cient data, as it only gradually became
understood that there are several other forms presenting the closest
points of resemblance in their morphological characters, both micro
and macroscopic, to the typhoid bacillus, with which they are not
 unfrequently associated, and, moreover, some of these simulatory
 forms are of very frequent occurrence in natural waters. Indeed, even
 at the present day, the identi<U+FB01>cation of particular forms or “ species ”
 of bacteria is in a transitional and highly unsatisfactory state, as it is
 daily becoming clearer that the characters, both morphological and
 physiological, of one and the same micro-organism are often liable to
 the profoundest modi<U+FB01>cations through changes of environment and
 other causes, whilst there are almost daily being discovered in nature
new forms which differ only from already well-known forms or
           ” in what
 “species              appear to be the most minute, tri<U+FB02>ing, and insig
ni<U+FB01>cant particulars.
    Under these circumstances, it is practically certain that some of
the bacilli discovered in water, and believed to have been typhoid
bacilli, must, in reality, have been only forms closely simulating the
more striking characters of the typhoid bacillus.     On the other hand,
 it is equally certain that a great many waters which have been sub
 mitted to examination for typhoid bacilli may have contained them
 without their being discovered, for, as will be pointed out later, the
  ordinary method pursued in the bacteriological examination of water,
 in which a few drOps, or at most a cubic centimetre or two, of the
 water is submitted to plate cultivation, can only, under the most
 exceptional circumstances, lead to the detection of typhoid bacilli.
    Thus, whilst there is considerable evidence that the typhoid bacilli
 have been found on a number of occasions in waters which had been
 convicted of distributing typhoid amongst        their consumers, the
 failure to discover these'bacilli in other waters equally guilty need
 excite no surprise when the very imperfect methods of examination
 which areicommonly employed 'for their discovery are taken into
 consideration.
    In connection with the above discoveries of typhoid bacilli in pot
 able water, I will only at this stage further remark that, in by far
the majority of cases, the waters accused of containing these bacilli

                 Report on the Bacteriology    of Water.              399
were well waters, and, as is well known, it is just this kind of water
which has most frequently been conclusively convicted of distribut
ing typhoid fever.
    The above discoveries of the typhoid bacillus in natural waters
have, in almost all cases, been made not by means of the ordinary
method of plate cultivation, which a<U+FB01>ords little or no chance of a few
typhoid bacilli being discovered amongst a host of common water
bacteria, the colonies of which generally grow with great rapidity
and not unfrequently cause rapid liquefaction of the gelatine, but by
special methods of treatment which have been devised to oppose the
proliferation of the water bacteria whilst not materially interfering
 with the growth and multiplication of the typhoid bacilli, the latter
thus acquiring a large numerical preponderance,           if not entirely
excluding   the other forms  present  in the water.
    Unfortunately, these conditions which foster the growth of the
typhoid bacillus to the exclusion of the ordinary water bacteria are
equally propitious to other microbes which are invariably associated
with the typhoid bacillus, and which, in fact, resemble it so closely,
 especially in morphological characters, that they may easily be mis
 taken for the typhoid bacillus, and it is this circumstance which
causes so much doubt to attach more especially to the earlier of those
alleged discoveries of the typhoid bacillus in potable water which are
recorded above.
    The particular micro-organism, which is especially liable to cause
confusion in this respect, is the so-called Bacillus coli communis. This
organism was described by Escherich, and is found regularly in the
 human intestinal tract and faces, as well as in the excreta of other
animals. It is regarded as identical with the Bacillus neapolitanus
(Emmerich),     and the “ Fseces bacillus ” described by Weisser,
whilst by recent experiments        I   have shown that it is closely
allied to, if not identical With, the Bacillus ethacetosuccim'cus
previously described by me. In all cases, therefore, in which water
is supposed to have been infected with the dejecta of typhoid
patients, the B. coli communis may be expected also to be present.
In order, therefore, to ascertain de<U+FB01>nitely whether the typhoid
bacillus is present in any given water, care must be taken that the
B. coli communt's is not mistaken for the former, and to guard against
this it would be a desideratum to have some method which would,
whilst revealing the presence of the typhoid bacillus, effectually
eliminate or separate out its almost constant attendant, the B. colt'
communis.     Unfortunately, this is a consummation which has not yet
been realised in fact, for not only is the vitality of the B. cell com
munis in water, as will be shown below, superior to that exhibited by
the typhoid bacillus, but in all attempts which have so far been made
to suppress the vitality of other organisms, and yet permit of the

 development    of the latter, the B. coli communis has shown itself to be
 possessed   of greater powers of reSistance than the typhoid bacillus
 itself. Hence, although the addition of various chemical substances
 in suitable proportions may effectually destroy or retard the growth
 of other organisms, yet the B. coli communis survives and remains
 present along with the typhoid bacillus ; indeed, in many cases it has
 been shown that such additions have actually destroyed the typhoid
 bacillus, and left the B. coli communis alone master of the <U+FB01>eld.    It is
 true that, growing in arti<U+FB01>cial cultures side by side, there are certain
 di<U+FB01>erences observable between these two organisms, for the B. coli
 communis grows more luxuriantly in the various culture-media em
 ployed than does the typhoid bacillus, or to use the expressive
 language of a French observer, the B. coli commnnis grows as though
it were well, and the typhoid bacillus as though it were ill; but yet
 on the gelatine plates of each there are nearly always colonies which
are indistinguishable from those of the other, whilst even in the
potato-cultures, which used to be regarded as the crucial test for the
typhoid bacillus, the B. coli communis may and does exhibit, under
certain conditions, growths which resemble in every respect those
produced by the typhoid bacillus. In two media, however, as has
 been pointed out by Dunbar (“Ueber den Typhusbacillus und den
Bacillus Coli Communis,” ‘ Zeitsch f. Hygiene,’ 1892, 491), a
marked difference is found in the behaviour of these two organisms.
 Thus, when inoculated into sterile milk, the typhoid bacillus renders
the liquid slightly acid, but never causes its coagulation; the B. coli
 commanis, on the other hand, at the temperature of the body coagu
lates the milk in from 24—48 hours, rendering it at the same time
 strongly acid. Again, when grown in sterile <U+FB02>uid meat extract or
broth, the B. coli commanis at 370 C. produces, in the course of from
3—12 hours, a quantity of gas (consisting of hydrogen and carbonic
 anhydride), whilst n0 formation of gas has, under the same conditions,
ever been observed in the case of the typhoid bacillus.
    This latter mode of distinguishing between the B. coli communis
and the typhoid bacillus     I  have reduced to the following extremely
simple and handy form suitable for their rapid di<U+FB02>erentiation :——The
organism under investigation is inoculated into a test-tube containing
ordinary gelatine peptone in a melted state, the latter is shaken to
distribute the bacilli throughout the liquid, which is then allowed to
solidify and maintained at the ordinary temperature (IS—20° 0.).
The tube, if it contains the B. coli communis, will invariably, after
12—48 hours, exhibit numerous conspicuous gas bubbles distributed
through the solid medium, whilst no such bubbles make their
appearance in similar tubes containing the typhoid bacillus.         The
test possibly depends upon the meat extract containing suf<U+FB01>cient
dextrose (derived from the postmortem transformation of the glycogen

                 Report on the Bacteriology      of Water.                     401
in the blood) for   a visible fermentation by the B. 0011: comments to
take place.   The bubbles of gas are certainly independent of any
ingredients  present in either the gelatine or in the peptone, for                I
have found them to form also in agar-agar-peptone, and also in meat
extract gelatine to which no peptone had been added?“‘          The great
convenience of the test depends upon its involving only the use of a,
medium which must invariably be at hand at all times in every
bacteriological laboratory, and also on its dispensing with the use of
an incubating temperature, whilst it has the further advantage over
Dunbar’s original broth-bubble test that the bubbles of gas being
<U+FB01>xed in the solid gelatine, the tubes can be examined at leisure even
days or weeks after inoculation, whilst with the broth-bubble test, if
the tubes are not examined at the right time, the fermentation may
have ceased; besides, in the broth, of course, the bubbles are not
nearly so conspicuous.     Extensive use has been made of this method
during the present investigation, and for rapidly and certainly dis
tinguishing between the typhoid bacillus and the B. coli oommum's                  I
have found it unequalled; on the other hand, it must be borne in
mind that it does not serve to distinguish between the B. colt communis
and many other fermenting organisms.
   A further but less certain distinction which should also be em
ployed for dilferentiating between the typhoid bacillus and the
B. 00111communis is the so-called indol-reaction.    This test is best ap
plied in the following   manner,  as recommended by Kitasato :—
   To 10 c.c. of the culture in ordinary alkaline peptone-broth of the
organism under examination, and which has been growing for
twenty-four hours in the incubator, add 1 0.0. of a solution of potas
sium or sodium nitrite (containing 0'02 gram in 100 c.c.) and then a
few drops of concentrated sulphuric acid.      If indol is present, a rose to
deep-red coloration    produced, depending on the interaction of nitrous
                      'is
acid with indol to form nitrosoindol nitrate which           of red colour.
                                                                is
 On applying this test to the B. colt' oommunis an indol-reaction should
be obtained, whilst the typhoid bacillus gives invariably a negative
result.   In practice have found
                     I                itadvisable not         to
                                                           apply the indol
 test until the broth-culture has been forty-eight hours in the in
cubator.
   Although the B. coli communis        generally supposed to give the
                                       is
indol-reaction, this character would appear not to be so constant as
is commonly imagined. In my own experiments have known one and

the same culture-series of the B. 00111 communis not to give the indol
reaction at one time, and yet subsequently to become possessed of
 this power, although       have not been able to determine the cause

that it might possibly be due to the growth of the bacillus having
become enfeebled,     I
                      tried growing it under unfavourable conditions,
viz., in phenol-broth, in which        I
                                    left the bacillus for months with
out transplanting, but even by this severe treatment          Ifound no
diminution in the indol-producing power.        The absence of indol
production by the B. coli communis has also been noticed by Dunbar,
who in his exhaustive memoir (loo. cit.) compares the behaviour of a.
culture of the typhoid bacillus with a culture of the B. coli communis,
and found that neither bacilli gave the indol-reaction.   It is obvious,
therefore, that indol production is not a necessary attribute of the
B. coli communis, and that too much reliance must not be placed on
it as a means of distinguishing between the typhoid bacillus and the
B.   coli cammum's.

    Where Found.—-—ln the blood, urine, fteces, as well as in the organs
of typhoid patients. Found by numerous investigators in water.
   Microscopic Appearance—A short, plump bacillus about three times
as long as broad, with rounded ends.     It occurs in the tissues usually
singly, but in arti<U+FB01>cial cultures it grows frequently into long threads.
It is very motile and is provided with numerous cilia, which are
attached to both the sides and ends of the bacillus.        To stain the
cilia add 22 drops of caustic soda to 16 c.c. of the mordant (Loe<U+FB02>ler).
It is not stained by Gram’s method, and stains less readily with
aqueous aniline solutions than most bacteria.      Giinther recommends
heating the cover-glass, after the dye has been poured on            for a
                                                                      it,

    Cultures: Gelatine Plates.—The colonies on the surface form large
spreading greyish-white iridescent expansions with jagged and ir
regular edge. Under a. low power they exhibit         brownish shimmer
                                                        a

with regular edge, and are covered with delicate irregular lines. N         o
liquefaction takes place.

    Potatoes—Produces an almost invisible greyish-white growth after
 forty-eight hours, but on touching the moist-looking surface with the
 needle a tough resistant pellicle is found.    On some potatoes, how
 ever, its growth is more apparent, so that the above is not the only
 appearance to which it may give rise.
    Blood Serum—Produces a milk-white expansion restricted to the
path of the needle.
   Broth—Renders it turbid.
   Milh.—Grows abundantly, rendering it slightly acid. N0 coagula
tion takes place.
   Remarks.-——lt grows best at about 37° C. Kitasato states that it
produces no indol reaction. It produces sulphuretted hydrogen in
iron-gelatine, the needle-track after from <U+FB01>ve to six days becoming
intensely black in colour. In iron-agar, at from 33° to 34° 0., this
black colour appears at the end of 24 hours (Fromme).       It produces
sulphuretted hydrogen in broth with or without peptone; compara
tive tests made with the B. coli communis revealed no di<U+FB01>erence either
in the degree of the reaction (as shown by the lead-paper test) or in
the rapidity with which it took place in the case of the two organisms.
The typhoid bacillus never produces gas in any arti<U+FB01>cial media. It
is destroyed when heated for ten minutes at 60° C.
   Injection into the aural vein of rabbits causes death in 24—28
hours (Fraenkel and Simmonds), guinea-pigs into which the cultures
are introduced by the mouth, as described for cholera, are also killed
(Seitz). Opinion is, however, still divided as to whether death is
due to mere intoxication by the bacterial products present in the
cultures, or to actual multiplication of the bacillus within the animal.

often in water by numerous investigators, and frequently mistaken
for the typhoid bacillus.
   Microscopic Appearance—The typical form is a. short bacillus 0'4       ,u.
broad and   2   to3 u long;    it  is, however, very variable, oval indi
viduals and forms resembling cocci being also _found.             It exists
chie<U+FB02>y as a double bacillus arranged in groups. It      is slightly motile,

12   cilia (Luksch).    Nicolle and Morax mention that the coli bacillus
has invariably fewer cilia than the typhoid, that whereas the former
rarely possesses more than six, the latter usually exhibits ten to
twelve, whilst the       cilia of the former are also far more fragile
(‘Annales de l’Institut Pasteur,’ vol. 12, 1893, p. 561). It does not
form spores.
    Cultures : Gelatine Plates.——Forzns round, and very often         oval,
smooth-rimmed granular colonies in the depth, which later become
yellowish-brown in colour. On the surface it forms <U+FB02>at, irregular,
pale white expansions, which under a low power exhibit a furrowed
appearance due to the unequal thickness of the colony in its different
parts. The colony also presents a distinctly wavy lineal structure
parallel to_ the periphery. No liquefaction ensues.
    Gelatine Tubes—Grows somwhat abundantly in the depth, pro
ducing small white pin-head colonies, whilst on the surface it forms
an expansion resembling the growth on gelatine plates.
    Agar-agar.—Grows abundantly on the surface, producing a dirty

    Blood Swarm—Forms a milk-white expansion.
    Potatoes.—Produces a slimy yellow expansion on some potatoes, on
others grey-white, whilst in some cases it resembles the typhoid
bacillus in being hardly visible.
    Broth—Renders it turbid.
    Milk—Renders it acid, and at 37° C. coagulates it in from twenty_
four to forty-eight hours.
    Remarks.——Both      cultures of twenty-four hours’ ago generally
exhibit considerable evolution of gas; ordinary gelatine or agar stab
eultures also generally exhibit bubbles of gas in the solid medium.
Such bubbles can invariably be obtained by inoculating into ordinary
melted gelatine, which is afterwards allowed to solidify (Percy
Frankland).       The addition of dextrose to the gelatiue is quite un
necessary      for this purpose.    Exhibits indol reaction after twenty
four to forty-eight hours’ culture in peptone broth.

 2.  Behaviour of Typhoid Bacill'l experimentally   introduced into Potable
                                     Water.
    The second kind of information concerning the behaviour of the
 typhoid bacillus in water has, as already mentioned, been gained by

                  Report  on the Bacteriology    of Water.             405
 direct experiment, 'i.e., by purposely introducing the bacillus into
water, and in this manner the conditions which are favourable and
unfavourable to the vitality in water of the typhoid bacillus can, of
course,     be much more readily      ascertained than by the study of
 such chance cases as those already enumerated above, in which the
 bacilli had, in the natural course of events, gained access to water.
    I have below expressed in a tabular'form the principal results of
the numerous investigators who have already availed themselves of
this method of experimenting on the behaviour of the typhoid bacillus
in   water.
    From this table it will be seen that diiferent observers ascribe very
 di<U+FB01>erent degrees of vitality to the typhoid bacillus in water, nor is
 this to be wondered at when it is remembered that the typhoid
 bacilli introduced into the waters may have been possessed of very
 di<U+FB01>erent degrees of initial vitality according to their age and previous
 history; whilst, secondly, the waters experimented with were, of
 course, not the same ; thirdly, the amount of food-material introduced
 into the water along with the bacilli must have been subject to the
very greatest variations, and again the temperatures and other condi
 tions under which the infected waters were preserved were equally
variable.
    Thus, taking the experiments made with distilled water, in which,
therefore, there is the most chance of the water having been of
 uniform quality, Braem found the introduced typhoid bacilli still
 alive after 188 days, whilst the longest duration of vitality in this
 medium observed by Hochstetter was <U+FB01>ve days, Meade Bolton,
 Slater, Straus and Dubarry, and Wolffhiigel and Riedel giving
 periods intermediate between these two wide extremes.          These dis
 crepancies in the case of distilled water are doubtless to be accounted
for partly by the di<U+FB02>'erence in initial vitality possessed by the different
typhoid bacilli employed and partly by the difference in the amount
 of culture-material imported into the distilled water along with the
bacilli themselves, whilst the actual numbers in which the bacilli
were introduced may also greatly in<U+FB02>uence the degree of longevity
observed.
    This wide divergence in the results obtained by previous observers
would alone call for a reinvestigation of this subject with a view to
ascertaining the longevity of the typhoid bacillus in de<U+FB01>nite types of
British potable water, and taking more into consideration the exact
chemical composition of the waters experimented with.
    There is, however, another point arising out of the results arrived
at by previous investigators which still more urgently demands re
investigation with a view to its con<U+FB01>rmation, quali<U+FB01>cation, or direct
contradiction, and this is the relatively far greater longevity of the
typhoid bacillus in sterilised than in unsterilised potable water,

which has been af<U+FB01>rmed more especially by Kraus and subsequently
by Karlinski.            This point is obviously of the very highest import
ance from a. practical hygienic point of view, as it is with unsterile
potable water that we are in practice alone concerned,                                    and the
duration of vitality ascribed to the typhoid bacillus in such water by
both these observers is of very limited extent—not more than seven
days.
    The experiments of Kraus are so striking, and have attracted so
much attention, that I will give them in more detail in the following
table :—

     These results indicate, therefore, that, on introducing                         the typhoid
bacilli     into the potable waters in question, which were almost
naturally sterile, the typhoid bacilli promptly disappeared as soon as
the water bacteria had undergone extensive multiplication,                                   which
had taken place in each of the three experiments by the seventh day
after the importation of the typhoid bacilli.
    These interesting experiments cannot, however, by the light of our
present knowledge, he accepted without criticism, for there cannot
be the slightest doubt that, when only the ordinary method of plate
cultivation is employed in such investigations on unsterilised water,
the typhoid bacilli will be generally overlooked unless they are
present in large numbers.                  Again, the attempts which have been
made, both by Kraus and other experimenters, to count the typhoid
colonies on plates containing such mixtures of colonies, and the
numerical estimates given of the typhoid bacilli in such unsterilised
waters, must be wholly illusory, for the number of typhoid colonies
which develope what may be called a typical appearance (i.e., one
which enables them to be readily recognised with reasonable cer
tainty) depends on a variety of diiferent circumstances, amongst
which may be mentioned the age of the plate, the extent to which

                    Report on the Bacteriology      of Water.           407
 the colonies    are crowded together on the plate, very probably, also,
 the nature of the other colonies on the plate, and certainly the degree
 of vitality possessed by the typhoid bacilli themselves.      Thus, if the
 numerical estimate of the typhoid colonies on a plate is made by
 counting as such the characteristic surface expansion colonies only,
 the result must be entirely fallacious, as nothing is, in my experi
 ence, commoner than to <U+FB01>nd only a vanishing proportion of the total
 number of typhoid colonies, even on a pure plate, giving rise to these

    In looking for typhoid bacilli in such arti<U+FB01>cially-infected unsterile
 waters it is, in fact, necessary to employ special methods for their detec
 tion similar to those which, as already pointed out, had to be devised
 for the examination of natural waters for the typhoid bacillus, and it is
 only when such special methods have been employed with a negative
 result that the conclusion can be legitimately drawn that the typhoid
 bacillus is not present in the living state in the particular volume of
 water operated on.
    In the present investigation, the uniform practice has been made
 of examining all unsterile waters by means of Parietti’s method of
 phenol broth-culture (see description below) in order to ascertain
 the presence or absence of the typhoid bacillus or of the B. 00111 com
 mums.
 Method of Detecting the Typhoid Bacillus and Bacillus Goli Communis
                               in Unstem'le Waters.
    It will not be necessary to describe the various methods which
 have been devised for discovering the presence of typhoid bacilli in
 water, but it will be suf<U+FB01>cient to point out that these are nearly all
 based upon the fact that the typhoid bacillus is, in comparison with
 most bacteria, but little affected by small doses of either phenol or
 dilute acids, so that, by adding suitable quantities either of phenol
 alone or of phenol in conjunction with acid to the culture-media, the
growth and multiplication of the typhoid bacillus is not materially
interfered with, whilst the proliferation of most, if not of all, the
water-bacteria is suppressed.
    Of these various methods, the one which I selected for the purposes
of this investigation was that devised by Parietti (“ Metodo di ricerca
del Bacillo del tifo nelle aque potabili,” ‘Rivista d’ Igiene e Sanita
pubblica,’ 1890).        This method, which consists in adding phenol
along with hydrochloric acid in certain proportions to neutral broth
is carried out as follows :—
    A series of test-tubes containing 10 c.c. of neutral broth, each
receive from 3 to 9 drops of a solution having the following composi
tion :—

               Phenol..  .......                         5grams.

               Distilledwater................          100   ,,
   (In practice, I generally employ some tubes to which 3 drops
(= 0‘25 0.0.) and others to which 5 drops (= 0'4 c.c.) of this solu
tion have been added.)
   To the tubes thus treated, from 1 drop to several cubic centimetres
of the water under investigation are added, and, after thoroughly
mixing the contents, the tubes are placed in the incubator at 37° C.
As soon as the tubes become turbid (which in the initial presence of
many typhoid bacilli will occur already in twenty-four hours, but if
only few are present, may be postponed for forty-eight, seventy-two,
or even more hours) they are submitted to ordinary plate cultivation
in three dilutions, the second and third dilutions only being actually
poured on to plates or into Petri dishes, whilst the <U+FB01>rst dilution
gelatine-tube should be preserved to see if gas-bubbles develops in it.
   The gelatine-plates thus prepared are frequently found to yield
nothing but typhoid colonies, whilst in some cases the latter are
mixed with the colonies of water-bacteria, and in some cases, again,
there are only colonies of water-bacteria on the plates. In no case
must it be concluded from the mere appearance of the colonies that
typhoid is present, but the colonies must always be submitted to the
further tests of
   1.  Microscopic examination.
   2.  Inoculation on to potatoes, and comparison of growth with that
         of simultaneous cultures of the typhoid bacillus on the same
         potatoes.
   3.  Inoculation into broth, and examination of the broth-culture
         after forty-eight hours' growth in the incubator at 37° C. for
         indol, which, if it is the typhoid bacillus, should be absent.
   4!. Inoculation into milk, which should not subsequently become
         coagulated on keeping for one week in the incubator.
   5.  Inoculation into a tube containing melted gelatiue-peptone; on
         distributing the bacilli in this and then congealing the gelatine,
         no gas-bubbles    should be formed on keeping at 18—20° C.,
         whilst  in the case  of the B. coli communis bubbles will make
         their appearance   in from twelve to forty~eight hours.
   The B. 0011: communis, as already pointed out, is even less sensitive
to phenol and acids than the typhoid bacillus.          In the case of those
unsterile waters infected with the B. coli communis, the above method
was similarly employed for its detection.
   The above outline will show that a systematic investigation of the
behaviour of the typhoid bacillus in unsterilised waters is attended
with considerable di<U+FB01>iculties, and involves an enormous amount of

close to the intake of the Grand Junction Waterworks, near Hamp
ton, on May 4, 1893; this spot was selected as being in that region
of the river from which the supply for London is abstracted.
   This water was submitted to chemical analysis with the following

 pare the respective behaviour of the two organisms in these three
 different states of the Thames water.
    The infection of the several waters was made on 11.5.1893, as
 follows :—
    I. Typhoid—Forty needle-loops were removed from the surface of
 an agar-culture of the typhoid bacillus which had been grown at
 18—20° C. for fourteen days, great care being taken to carry as little
 as possible of the culture-material along with the growth.                       This
 growth was introduced into 50 c.c. of steam-sterilised Thames water
 and violently shaken for <U+FB01>fteen minutes in a sterile bottle to
 thoroughly disintegrate the masses.              This water-dilution was then
 employed for the infection of the larger quantities of water as indi
 cated below.
    II.  B. coli.—~The water-dilution of the B. cell communis was made
 in exactly the       same way as that of the typhoid bacillus described
 above, excepting that only twenty-<U+FB01>ve needle-loops                   of the growth
 were taken, as owing to its greater thickness it was detachable in
 larger masses from the surface of the agar.                 The culture employed
 was of just the same age (fourteen days), and had been grown at the
same temperature (ls—20° C.) as the typhoid bacillus.
    With the water-dilutions thus prepared the following infections
were made :—
                   Typhoid bacillus.                  B. coll communis.

       2000 c.c. received     8 c.c. of          1000 c.c. received 3 c.c.     of
           the water dilution.                        the water dilution.
                         Porcelain-<U+FB01>ltered Thames Water.
        750 c.c. received 3 c.c. of               750 c.c. received 2 c.c. of
           the water dilution.                        the water dilution.

 respectively, and in this manner the individual <U+FB02>asks are readily

    In order to ascertain whether the infection of the water had com
municated any large amount of organic matter to the water, some of
the infected waters were submitted to a partial chemical analysis.
 This is a matter which has, unfortunately, been almost entirely
neglected in previous observations on the vitality of pathogenic
bacteria in potable ‘waters, and it is obvious that if such investiga
tions are to have anything but a negative value, the waters, after
infection, must not differ materially in their chemical composition
from that which they possess in their natural state.
   These chemical analyses yielded the following results :—

   The sample of Thames water which between the date of collection
(4.5.1893)     and the date of <U+FB01>rst examination (11.5.1893) had remained
in bottles almost completely <U+FB01>lled up to the stopper, and at a tempera
ture of about 10—12° 0. exhibited in the <U+FB01>rst instance an unusually
small number of bacteria (Only 290 in 1 c.c.). There can be little
doubt that the original number present must have been greater than
 this, and have become diminished during this period of residence in
the stoppered bottles, for on introduction into the <U+FB02>asks plugged with
cotton-wool they underwent enormous multiplication.               In the <U+FB02>ask
 kept   at   19° C.  the  multiplication   was  doubtless  most rapid, but had
 already    fallen  again    to 45,000   per c.c. on  the second  examination,
 whilst in the <U+FB02>ask kept at 6° C. multiplication and subsequent decline
 were probably both less rapid, so that on the occasion of the second
 examination the number present was still 563,000 per c.c., which
 underwent continuous diminution during the remainder of the time
that this <U+FB02>ask was kept under observation.
    These phenomena of initial multiplication followed by decline have
 been already frequently called attention to, both in the former
 Reports and by other observers, so that there is no necessity to dwell
 further upon it here beyond pointing out that it shows that the
 water-bacteria in this sample of water employed were in an active
 and <U+FB02>ourishing state under the conditions maintained during the
 experiment.
 Emamination       by  Plate-Cultivation of the Unsterilised Thames Water
           infected  with  Typhoid and B. colt comm-unis respectively.
    Having in the previous pages traced the numerical changes which
 took place in the bacterial contents of the control uninfected un

 sterilised Thames water, will now proceed to describe what occurred
 in the case of the same unsterilised Thames water which was infected
 with typhoid and coli respectively (in the manner indicated on

 p. 410).
    The <U+FB02>asks      containing these infected unsterilised Thames waters
 were kept at a winter (6—-8° C.) and a summer (19° C.) temperature
 respectively, and were examined from time to time by gelatine plate
 cultivation, and the results of these periodical examinations are
 recorded in the following table :

                   Report on   the Bacteriology   of l/Vater.           417
    From the above table it will be seen that the unsterilised Thames
 water, which contained remarkably few bacteria (only 290 per c.c.) at
 the time, was infected with a very large number of typhoid bacilli
 (about 78,000 per c.c.). The total number of bacteria in the water
 kept at the winter temperature of 6—8° 0. underwent enormous
 multiplication followed by decline, as in the case of the uninfected
 unsterilised water. In the water kept at the summer temperature of
 19° C., 0n the other hand, the numbers found exhibited almost con
 tinuous decline, and also closely resembled those found in the unin
 fected unsterilised water preserved under similar conditions.           In
 both cases, however, there must have been a great multiplication of
 the water-bacteria, for whilst the gelatine plates prepared from these
 waters during the <U+FB01>rst week after infection admitted of the ready
 recognition of typhoid colonies, in the subsequent examinations this
 was altogether impossible, so that the large number of colonies
 present on these later plate cultivations must have been derived from
 the extensive multiplication of the comparatively few water-bacteria
 present in this unsterilised water at the outset of the experiments.
    I must, however, again emphasize what       I  have stated before, that
 whilst the recognition of typhoid colonies on such plates containing
the colonies of numerous water-bacteria is often dif<U+FB01>cult and attended
with much uncertainty, any estimation of the number of typhoid
colonies on such plates, as has been attempted by some observers, is
altogether illusory and calculated to lead to the most erroneous con
clusions. For whilst the surface colonies of the typhoid bacillus are
even liable to be confounded with the surface colonies of some other
bacteria, in the appearance of the depth colonies (and, of course, in
ordinary gelatine plates the majority of the colonies are beneath the
surface) there is nothing to distinguish them from an immense
number of other forms common in water. Thus, whilst in the above
series of examinations     I  have no hesitation in saying that on the
plates prepared on the 11th, 16th, and 17th May, typhoid colonies
were present,   I rely for the determination of their presence or absence
after those dates entirely on the results of the examinations by phenol
broth-culture which will be given below. Again, even in the case of
those plates which obviously contained typhoid colonies,      I do not con
sider that any estimate of their number could be justi<U+FB01>ably made, as
such an estimate could only include the surface colonies which had
developed the characteristic expansions.
   Thus the examination by plate-culture of these unsterilised waters
does not enable us to ascertain whether the typhoid bacilli under
went any numerical increase in these waters, but from the fact that
no such increase was observed in the case of the typhoid bacilli
similarly introduced into steamsterilised Thames water (see p. 451),
and in which, therefore, the conditions for their multiplication were

far more favourable, there can be no reasonable doubt that they did
not undergo any increase but only decline; this supposition       is,more
over, corroborated by the results of the examinations by phenol
broth-culture, to which I  shall presently refer.
I    will now turn to the similar examinations made by gelatine plate
culture of the same unsterilised Thames water infected with the
B. coli oommunis, the results of which are recorded in the table on
p. 418.
   The results recorded in the above table for the B. coli communis are
almost precisely parallel to those recorded in the previous table for
the typhoid bacillus. There    is again, in the case of the water kept at
the winter temperature of 6—8° C., the enormous multiplication in
the total number of bacteria present, followed by rapid and almost
continuous subsequent decline.      In the case of the water kept at the
summer temperature of 19° C., a slight increase was observed on the
occasion of the second examination (but, as pointed out in the case of
the typhoid table, a great increase followed by rapid decline may have
taken place in the interval between the <U+FB01>rst and second examina
tions), after which there was a great decline followed by some re
crudescence at the end.     In the case of the waters kept both at the
winter and the summer temperatures respectively, however,               it   is
obvious that extensive multiplication of the water-bacteria must have
taken place, owing to the very large increase in the number of
colonies causing liquefaction of the gelatine which was observed.
   For the same reasons as stated in the case of the typhoid bacillus
(see p. 417),   is impossible to form any estimate of the numbers in
               it
which the coli bacilli were present after the day (11.5.1893) of their
introduction, nor as to the length of time over which they persisted in
the living state in these waters.       From the corresponding experi
ments, however, made with the steam-sterilised Thames water,            it   is
quite possible that the B. coli communis, unlike the typhoid bacillus,
may have undergone some multiplication in the water. _ It         is to the
examinations by the     method   of  phenol broth-culture   that  we must
again have recourse in order to ascertain how long the coli bacilli
remained alive in these unsterilised waters.
   There  is  a point which   is  brought out very strikingly in these
tables, and to which I  would draw attention at this stage, and that is
that the total number of bacteria present in these unsterilised waters
at the end of the period over which these experiments extended, was,
both in the case of the uninfected waters (see table, p. 413) as well as in
that of the typhoid (see table, p. 415), and in that of the coli (see table,
p. 418), greater in the water maintained at the summer than at the
winter temperature respectively. The probable explanation of this
phenomenon would appear to be that at the lower temperature
 (6—8° 0.) many of the bacteria present may be unable to form spores,

and    thus perish by the long residence in the water, whilst at the
higher temperature (19° 0.), although the fully developed bacteria
are more rapidly destroyed, a larger proportion of them give rise to
spores and thus lead to a larger permanent bacterial population in
the water.
Examination       of the Unstem'lised Thames Waters, Infected and Unim
                        fected by Phenol Broth-culture.
   I   must now call attention to the results of the phenol broth
 cultivations made both with the unsterilised Thames water, as well
 as with that infected with the typhoid bacillus and the B. coli
commum's respectively.
   The following experiment will show how under favourable condi
tions, the phenol broth test serves to distinguish a water containing
typhoid bacilli from another in which they are absent; thus
                    Phenol Broth Experimmtts  (12.5.1893).
   (1)   1 c.c.  uninfected unsterilised Thames water added to 10 c.c.
            broth + 5 drops phenol solution.
   (2)   1 c.c. uninfected unsterilised Thames water added to 10 c.c.
            broth + 3 drops phenol solution.
         0'5 c.c. uninfected unsterilised Thames water added to 10 c.c.
            broth + 5 drops phenol solution.
   (4)   0‘5 c.c. uninfected unsterilised Thames water added to 10 c.c.
          ‘ broth + 3 drops phenol solution.
   (5)   1 c.c. unsterilised Thames water infected with typhoid     added
            to 10 c.c. broth + 5 drops phenol solution.
   (6)   1 c.c. unsterilised Thames water infected with typhoid added
            to 10 c.c. broth + 3 drops phenol solution.
   (7)   0'5 c.c. unsterilised Thames water infected with typhoid added
            to 10 c.c. broth + 5 drops phenol solution.
   (8)   0'5 c.c. unsterilised Thames water infected with typhoid added
            to 10 c.c. broth + 3 drops phenol solution.
   These eight tubes, all in duplicate, were placed in an incubator at
38° 0., and on the following day, whilst all the uninfected tubes, 1, 2,
3, and 4, were clear, all the infected tubes, 5, 6, 7, and 8, were turbid,
thus showing that whilst the addition of the phenol solution had
prevented the proliferation of the ordinary water-bacteria in the
uninfected Thames water, the extensive multiplication of the typhoid
bacilli in the infected Thames water had taken place in spite of the
presence of the same proportions of phenol. In the same way, on
the following day, similar quantities of the unsterilised Thames
water infected with the B. colt comments were introduced into broth

                                    Report on the Bacteriology                    of Water.                  425
tubes, to which the same proportions, as above, of phenol solution
were added, and all these tubes similarly became turbid on being
kept at 38° C. for twenty-four hours.
  Thus at the outset of this series of experiments, the uninfected
Thames water was sharply distinguishable by means of the phenol
broth test from the same Thames water after infection with either
the typhoid bacillus or the B. 00111communis.
  The uninfected and infected unsterilised Thames waters were
again compared by the method of phenol broth cultivation on
29.5.1893.

    The results recorded in the above table indicated that on 29.5.1893,
whilst there    were still no bacteria in the uninfected unsterilised
 Thames water to interfere with the phenol broth test, this test pointed
 to the presence of living typhoid bacilli in the typhoid-infected Thames
 waters, which had been kept both at 6° C. and at 19° 0. (<U+FB02>asks            R                                 l

              1
typhoid bacilli were now less numerous or in a less active condition
 in the <U+FB02>ask       (19° C.) than in the <U+FB02>ask

became turbid, and then only after forty-eight hours, whilst the tube
in which only 0'5 0.0. of water was employed did not become turbid
at all.
    It  must not, however, be supposed that the diagnosis of typhoid
bacilli in these waters was allowed to rest on such slender evidence as
the mere clouding of these phenol broth-cultures, but the latter were
submitted to gelatine plate cultivation to see if the characteristic
typhoid colonies made their appearance, and these colonies were
further con<U+FB01>rmed by inoculation (a) on to potatoes for exhibition of
the characteristic growth, (b) into gelatine tubes to see if bubbles of
gas would make their appearance, (0) into broth for the indol test,
and generally also (d) into milk to see whether coagulation of the
casein would take place.         Thus in the case of the above phenol broth
cult-ures commenced on 29.5.1893, the <U+FB01>nal con<U+FB01>rmation of typhoid
was not obtained until 12.6.1893, or a fortnight later.
   The phenol broth test was again applied to the waters on 5.6.1893,
with/the following results (p. 427).

             Colonies hearing some resemblance to typhoid yielded growths
          on potatoes, which were also not unlike typhoid, but on inocula
          tion into gelatine tubes a green <U+FB02>uorescence was obtained, con~
          clusively proving that it was another organism and not typhoid
          or cell.

twenty-<U+FB01>ve days previously, still contained living typhoid bacilli, both in

that kept at 6° 0., the number and vital activity of the typhoid                         bacilli
being apparently greater in the latter than in the former.

on the same date also             still contained these bacilli in a living state, both
in   that portion of the water kept at 19° C. as well as                in  that maintained at
6°   0.
    3. The un<U+FB01>ltered uninfected Thames water which had been maintained
under exactly similar conditions, contained no bacteria which after careful
ewamination could              be mistaken        either for the typhoid bacillus or the B.

           The small colonies on the plate which alone exhibited any
        resemblance      to typhoid were examined as in No. 85 above, and

    From these examinations it appears that on 14.6.1893,—
    1. The typhoid bacillus was no longer demonstrable in the unsterilised
Thames water, which had been infected with it thirty-four days pre
viously.     It had disappeared both in that portion of the water which had
been preserved at a winter, as well as in that kept at a summer, tempera
ture.
    2. The B. coli communis, on the other hand, was easily demonstrable
in similar    water which had been preserved under precisely the same con
ditions.
    These infected unsterilised Thames waters were again submitted
to examination on 21.6.1893, with the following results :—

still became turbid when inoculated with both uninfected and in

were added remained clear after inoculation with both waters.
   The plate cultivations made from the above broth-tubes, which
became turbid, yielded the following results :—

                   fluorescent of these colonies, and bearing therefore a faint
                   resemblance to typhoid, were transferred to potatoes, on which
                   they gave rise to light brown, sharply demarcated growths,

            The plates exhibited an apparently pure cultivation of a
         liquefying organism, the      colonies having a strong resemblance
         to those of B. Zz'qm'dus (see 2nd Report, p. 186). Some of the
         colonies which had not yet caused liquefaction were trans
         ferred to potatoes, on which they gave rise to thick, whitish,
         waxy growths, quite unlike those of typhoid.

         to potatoes, on which the small dot and <U+FB02>uorescent expansion
         colonies gave rise to light brown sharply marked growths, and
         the liquefying colonies to shining slimy colourless growths;
         none of these were, therefore, similar to those of typhoid.

            The plates appeared to be pure cultivations;               the depth
          colonies were small dots, often oval in shape, and the surface
         colonies resembled very small

          in which the colonies were few and far between there were
         none of the typical expansion colonies resembling typhoid.
          On transference to potatoes, shining slimy growths, having
         the appearance of drops of water, were obtained.
   This <U+FB01>nal       examination of these unsterilised typhoid-infected
Thames waters therefore again con<U+FB01>rmed the previous results, which
may be thus summarised :—
   (1.) The unsterilised         uninfected Thames water, collected at
            Hampton        on   5.5.1893,       contained throughout the
            entire course of the series of experiments no bacteria
            resembling either the typhoid bacillus or the B. coli
             comma/his.
   (2.) The unsterilised Thames water infected with typhoid
             on 11.5.1893, was still found to contain living typhoid
             bacilli on 5.6.1893, or twenty-<U+FB01>ve days after infection,
             whilst on 14.6.1893, thirty-four days after infection,
             they were no longer demonstrable.
    (3.)   These    remarks apply equally to the waters preserved at
              a. winter and a summer              temperature respectively,

  434               Profs. Percy        F rankland and Marshall Ward.
                 although there is some evidence that on the last day
                of their detection the typhoid bacilli were present,
                either in larger numbers or in a more active state in
                the water maintained at the winter than in that at
                the summer temperature.
      (4.)   The      same unsterilised Thames water infected with the
                B. coli Communis on the same day, and. kept under pre
                cisely similarzconditions of temperature, 800., was still
                found to contain living coli bacilli forty days after
                their introduction.                 These bacilli doubtless persisted
               in the living state, even for a much longer period oi
               time than this, no later examinations being made;
                and on the occasion of their last detection they did
               not appear to have lost any of their original vitality,
               as they still promptly reacted with the phenol broth
               test.

     In the       recent     cholera epidemic at Hamburg, it is now almost
 universally recognised that the most important agent in distributing
 the zymotic poison was the highly polluted and un<U+FB01>ltered water of
the River Elbe.               This water, moreover, during the epidemic was
found to be unusually rich in salt, in fact at times it was distinctly
 brackish in character. Thus a sample of Hamburg water sent to me
by Mr. Ernest Hart in October, 1892, and which                                       I    submitted to
 analysis,     had    the following composition                 :—

    The high percentage of salt is due to the waste liquors which are
discharged from the Stassfurth salt works and other factories into
the Elbe and its tributaries.                   Now it has been more recently shown

    These results show that the presence of an unusually high propor
 tion of salts may not improbably have played an important part in
 the distribution of cholera by means of the water of the Elbe in the
 recent Hamburg epidemic, and possibly also by means of the
Thames water in some of the former London epidemics, as at that
time the metropolitan supply was in part derived from the tidal
portion of the river.

   Three portions of pure sodium chloride, weighing respectively 0'5,
5'0, and   15'0 grams, were sterilised in the air-oven at 150° C. for
several hours, and then placed in three sterile 500 c.c. measuring
<U+FB02>asks.    To each of these was added suf<U+FB01>cient of the typhoid-infected
unsterilised Thames water (p. 410) to dissolve the salt, and the
solution was in each case further diluted to the 500 c.c. mark with
the same infected unsterilised Thames water.            These saline waters
were then distributed in smaller <U+FB02>asks plugged with cotton-wool, and
two of the latter of each particular strength were placed in the
refrigerator at 6—8° C., and two in the incubator at 19° C. Thus there
were

   These saline waters, like the others, were prepared on 11.5.1893,
and were examined by gelatine plate cultivation at frequent intervals
subsequently.       The results obtained must obviously be compared
with those from the typhoid-infected unsterilised Thames water, to
which no salt was added, and which have already been recorded in
the Table on pp. 415 and 416, but which are again given, so as to

   From the above table it will be seen that the addition of common
salt to the typhoid-infected unsterilised Thames water occasioned an
enormous increase in the number of water-bacteria, the effect being
most pronounced in the case of the water to which 3 per cent.
addition had been made, whilst the water which had received an
addition of only 0'1 per cent. of sodium chloride gave results which
did not diifer materially from those yielded by the water to which no
salt had been added.
   The addition of salt was by no means conducive to the welfare of
all the different kinds of water-bacteria present, but, on the contrary,
from the appearance of the plate cultivations, it was evident that
some forms were favoured at the expense of others; thus, on the
plates prepared from the 3 per cent. salt water, there was a con
spicuous absence of liquefying colonies, these plates having, in fact,
almost the appearance of pure cultivations.       This entirely bears out
what   I  found a number of years ago (“On the Multiplication of
                     ‘
Micro-organisms,” Proc. Roy. Soc.,’ 1886), that in a water containing
only a very limited number of species there is generally far more
extensive multiplication than in the case of one containing many
diiferent species.                                  .
   The  manner   in which   the salt Operated is most  apparent from that
<U+FB02>ask of the water to which an addition of 3 per cent. had been made,
and which was preserved in the refrigerator (6—8° 0.), as in this
case the multiplication took place most slowly.         Thus, whilst the
water at the outset contained 78,000 bacteria per c.c., of which nearly
all were typhoid bacilli, after six days there were only 300 bacteria
per c.c., so that there must have been an enormous destruction in the
interval, but the bacteria left subsequently underwent enormous
multiplication, although more slowly than in the case of the corre
sponding <U+FB02>ask kept in the incubator 19° C.).
   In all cases it will be seen that the multiplication was followed by
decline, but this decline was greatly retarded in those waters which
had received the large additions of salt.
   We must now consider the effect of these additions of salt on the
typhoid bacilli in the waters, as indicated by the results of phenol
broth-culture.
   These saline waters were <U+FB01>rst submitted to phenol broth-culture on

   Thus, the only saline water which gave a positive reaction with the
phenol broth test was the one in which an addition of only 0'1 per
cent. of salt had been made, and, even in this case,        was only the                                     it
<U+FB02>ask which had been kept at the winter temperature 'of 6—8° C. in
the refrigerator, whilst the corresponding <U+FB02>ask preserved at the
summer temperature of 19° C. gave a negative result. Plate cultiva
tions were made of the turbid broth-tube No. 11, and these yielded
the characteristic typhoid colonies, which were further con<U+FB01>rmed by
potato growth, and negative results with the indol and gas-bubble tests.
On referring to the results' of phenol broth-culture (pp. 424—434)
obtained with the corresponding waters to which no salt had been
added,     will be seen that they present a great contrast to these, as
                it
both the incubator and refrigerator <U+FB02>asks of the typhoid-infected
unsterilised Thames water gave a positive reaction, and were found
                                               '

days after infection, the nnsterilised Thames water still contained living
typhoid bacilli, as did also the same water to which 0'1 per cent. common
salt had been added, and which had been preserved at (5—8” G. ; 0n the

only received 0'1 per cent. salt, but which had been kept at 19° C., the
typhoid bacilli were no longer demonstrable.
   These saline waters were again examined by phenol broth-culture

           The colonies presented some resemblance to typhoid, so they
        were    further examined by potato growth, indol, gas-bubble,
        and milk tests, in all of which the resemblance was maintained.
        Microscopically, the bacilli appeared smaller than typhoid, but
        the difference was not su<U+FB02>icient to place the matter beyond
        doubt.     They were <U+FB01>nally proved not to be typhoid by keeping
        the gelatine tube cultures for some time, when both the surface
        and depth growths were found to be distinctly yellow in colour.
        I have repeatedly encountered this same organism, which
        might be mistaken for typhoid in its earlier appearance in
        plate cultures, but it must clearly be understood that the
        resemblance is only a super<U+FB01>cial one, and it was only sub
        mitted to so many tests because in these examinations anything
        bearing the slightest resemblance to typhoid was remanded
        for further enquiries.

     Thus, again, on this occasion, 21.6.1893, it was found impossible to
demonstrate the presence of typhoid bacilli in any of these saline waters.

             The potato-growths obtained from the colonies bore some
          resemblance   to typhoid, although the surface was rather too
          shining.   On inoculating into gelatine tubes,   was found that it
          very slow liquefaction took place. This was, therefore, the same
          organism which had been several times before met with in this
          <U+FB02>ask.    Under the microscope the bacilli also present some re

             The plates exhibited small, milk-drop colonies, with slight

          potatoes they yielded light yellow, shining growths, unlike
          those of typhoid.

        oculated from these yielded, in course of time, brown surface
        growths quite unlike typhoid.
   The results of these experiments with the unsterilised Thames
water, to which 0‘1, 1, and 3 per cent. of common salt respectively
had been added, are instructive in more ways than one.      Thus :—
   (1.) They show that the addition of the salt stimulated the
          growth and multiplication of some of the water
          bacteria to an enormous extent, the effect being
          the most marked with the largest proportion of salt
          (3 per cent.), whilst the water to which only 0-1 per
          cent. of salt was added, behaved almost exactly like
          the untreated Thames water.
   (2.) This multiplication was, as usual, followed by decline,
          but the saline waters remained, even after six weeks,
          more densely, and with the larger proportion of salt
          much more densely, populated than the Thames water
          to which no salt was added.
   (3.) As  regards the effect of the salt addition on the typhoid
          bacilli present in the'water, the experiments show
          that they were most prejudicially in<U+FB02>uenced.            Thus
          whilst on the eighteenth day after infection the
          typhoid bacilli were easily demonstrable in the ordi
          nary unsterilised Thames water to which no salt had
          been added, and also in that which had received 01
          per cent. of salt and which had been kept at 6—8° 0.,
          they were not discoverable in any of the waters to
          which 1 and 3 per cent. salt had been added, nor in
          that which had received only 0-1 per cent. salt, but
          which had been kept at the summer temperature of
          19° C.
   (4.) In the     case of the 3 per cent. salt addition,      I am of
          opinion that the rapid disappearance of the typhoid
          bacilli is largely due to the direct action of the salt,
          whilst in the case of the smaller proportions it may
          also be due to the great multiplication of some of the
          common water-bacteria.
   Further experiments on the behaviour of typhoid bacilli in Thames
water, to which salt had been added, were subsequently made (see
pp. 530, ct seg.), they proved entirely con<U+FB01>rmatory of the results just
recorded above, both as to the stimulation of the multiplication of the

  sterilised Thames water containing typhoid bacilli.
  Behaviour    of the   Typhoid Bacillus and of   the  B. coli communis in
        Steam-sterilised  Thames   Water (First Series of Ewperiments).
     It will  now be interesting to consider the behaviour of these bacilli
  in the precisely parallel series of experimentsmade with the same
  sample of Thames water which had been previously sterilised by
  steam.     These experiments are of importance more especially because
  they enable us to ascertain whether the water contains the necessary
  food materials for these particular bacteria, as, owing to the absence
  of other forms, it is now possible to determine how the actual numbers
  of these bacteria are affected by residence in the water.
     The infection and distribution of these steam-sterilised waters has

  already been described on pp. 410 and 411, so that can pass at once to
 their subsequent examination, made both by gelatine plate and phenol
  broth-culture, at di<U+FB01>erent intervals of time.
     In the table (p. 452) the fate of the typhoid bacilli introduced into
 the steam-sterilised Thames water on 11.5.1893, is followed over a.
 period of seventy-six days, and it will be seen that during this time
 their numbers underwent an almost continuous decline. Thus, whilst
 at the outset they were present to the number of, in round numbers,
 70,000 per cub. cm., at the end of this period their presence was
 only just demonstrable by gelatine plate cultivation at all, and not
 more than from 6—12 were discoverable in            l cub. cm.   The most
 important feature in this chronicle of their deportment is the circum
 stance that they exhibited no multiplication or increase in numbers
 during their residence in the water, clearly showing, therefore, that
 the latter did not afford the nutriment and other conditions necessary
 for the proliferation of the typhoid bacilli. In fact, the decline from
 the commencement         is an unbroken one, with the exception of the
 solitary observation of an increase from 27,000 on 22.5.1893, to 42,000
on 29.5.1893, in the case of the water maintained at a winter tem
perature.      Whatever may have been the cause of this increase, it is
not suf<U+FB01>ciently great to be comparable with that extensive reproduc
tion which takes place in the case of these bacteria which are the
natural inhabitants of water. Moreover, that the water was not
suited to the well-being of the typhoid bacilli was further testi<U+FB01>ed to
by the fact that the colonies on the gelatine plates became smaller,
feebler, and more degenerate as time went on, until on the occasion
of the last few examinations, they were, with dif<U+FB01>culty, recognisable
as typhoid colonies, and exhibited a. marked disinclination to form
the characteristic growths expanding over the surface of the gelatine.

   As regards the    e<U+FB02>fect of the higher or lower temperature at which
the waters were maintained,      it appeared throughout the greater part
of the time that the typhoid bacilli in the <U+FB02>ask, kept at the summer
temperature (19° 0.), su<U+FB02>'ered more rapid degeneration than those in
the water, which was preserved at the winter temperature of 6° 0.,
although quite at the last this relationship was reversed.
   It is interesting to contrast, with the above results, the behaviour
of the B. coli communis placed under precisely similar conditions in
the same water and over the same period of time. The results of
this comparative investigation are recorded in the following table :——

   From the above table it will be seen that the B. coli communis
presents    a great contrast to the typhoid bacillus in respect of its
behaviour in this steam-sterilised Thames water. Thus, at the com
mencement of the experiment, both bacilli were present in about the
same numbers, the typhoid-infected        water containing 74,000, and
the coli-infected water, 69,000 bacilli per 1 c.c. respectively, but
whilst the subsequent numbers found in the typhoid-infected waters
were invariably less than this initial number in the case of the coli
infected waters, the initial number was subsequently very greatly
exceeded, the observed multiplication      being greatest in the water
kept   at a  summer  temperature.  This   multiplication was afterwards
followed by a corresponding decline, but even at the end of the
seventy-<U+FB01>ve     days over which the observations were extended, the
number of the coli bacilli greatly exceeded that of the typhoid bacilli.
It is. moreover, worthy of remark that the coli-infected water kept at
19° 0., in which the most extensive multiplication       took place, ulti
mately contained a smaller number of coli bacilli than the water
maintained at 6° 0., in which the multiplication had been less con
siderable.
   The above results, obtained by the gelatine plate cultivation of the
typhoid and coli-infected steam-sterilised Thames waters, were re
peatedly con<U+FB01>rmed and supplemented by the method of phenol
broth-culture, thus :—

      These examinations by phenol broth-culture show, therefore, that,
 on 5.6.1893, the typhoid-infected steam-sterilised Thames water
 reacted already in twenty-four hours with the test, irrespectiver of
 whether 3 drops or 5 drops of phenol solution were added to the
 10 c.c. of broth; whilst, by referring back to p. 427, it will be seen
 that the typhoid-infected unsterilised Thames water only reacted in
 twenty-four hours, even with the 3 drops of phenol solution, in the case
 of the water which had. been kept at the winter temperature, whilst
 the summer temperature water only reacted after forty-eight hours.
 From these comparative tests it can be inferred, therefore, that, on
 the date in question, the typhoid bacilli were in a less vigorous con
 dition in the unsterilised than in the sterilised water.
      Of the plate cultivations made from the turbid broth tubes Nos.
 61, 57, and 59, those from N0. 61 yielded typical typhoid colonies
 which were con<U+FB01>rmed by growth on potatoes and by negative results
 with the indol and gas-bubble tests ; the plates from Nos. 57 and 59,

on the other hand, yielded the typical colonies of the B. coli com
munis, and these were further con<U+FB01>rmed by growth in potatoes, and
by positive results with the indol and gas-bubble tests.
   The above phenol broth-culture tests were all made with 0'5 and
1'0 c.c. of the water, but on the same day (5.6.1893) some further
experiments were made to incidentally determine whether much
smaller volumes       single drop) of water would react, and, if so,

   The interest attaching to the phenol broth examinations consists in
the circumstance that the actual number of typhoid and coli bacilli
present in the volumes of water used can be calculated from the
results of the plate cultivations made on the same day (see pp. 452 and
454). Thus,       will be seen from the tables on pp. 456 and 457, that
                              it
there was, in nearly all cases, practically no diiierence in the time
which elapsed before the phenol broth tubes became turbid, irrespec
tively of whether 0'5 c.c., c.c., or only drop of the same water was

in those waters infected with this bacillus.

   From the above      will be seen that even on 25.7.1893, when the
                            it
plate  cultivations  (see p. 452) were only yielding        about twelve
colonies per c.c.,  and  these colonies of  very   feeble and degenerate             a
character, the phenol broth-cultures of          c.c. of the water still                     1
became turbid in forty-eight hours, and thus revealed the presence of
living typhoid bacilli with the greatest facility.
   On the other hand, when the number of typhoid bacilli in the
water  is small,    may very easily happen that a phenol broth tube
                      it
now and again may fail to go turbid (as in the case of Broth tubes
443 and 444, see table above), and         very necessary, therefore, to       it   is
exercise great caution, and not to draw conclusions from           single                                            a

   The above results were most unexpected, for they show that,
although as many as 75,000 typhoid bacilli per 1 0.0. were introduced
into this water, they were entirely destroyed in <U+FB01>ve days at 19° C.,
and had undergone a very large reduction in number at 6—8° C.,
whilst in twelve days they were no longer discoverable in this water
kept at the low temperature.      On 2.6.1893 sterile broth was added
to the <U+FB02>asks, which were then placed in the incubator at 38° C., but
even this treatment did not lead to any revivi<U+FB01>cation of the typhoid
bacilli, which could neither be detected by plate cultivation nor
phenol broth-culture.
   The same rapid destruction of the B. coli communis was observed
in this water, as will be seen from the following table :—

    Thus, in the case of the B. coli communis again, there was the same
 disappearance    in <U+FB01>ve days of the bacilli in the water kept at 19° 0.,
 the great diminution in numbers in the same time in the water kept
 at 6——8° 0., followed by complete disappearance of the bacilli in this
 water also by the twelfth day.     Similar attempts made by the addi
 tion of sterile broth to resuscitate the bacilli in these waters also
                                                          ‘
 proved unavailing.
    These results, showing that the typhoid and coli bacilli were more
 rapidiy destroyed in the porcelain-<U+FB01>ltered than in the unsterilised,
 and far more rapidly than in the steam-sterilised, Thames water,
 were so surprising that it was necessary to banish every suspicion
 of some accidental disturbing cause having arisen in these experi
 ments.                       _
    The most obvious suggestion was that the <U+FB01>lter itself might have
 introduced some antiseptic substance into the water.          This was,
 however, highly improbable, as the <U+FB01>lter in question had only been
 previously used for the similar sterilisation of Thames. and Loch
 Katrine waters.       In order to abolish this objection, however, the
 porcelain cylinder was thoroughly scrubbed externally with a tooth
brush, and then upwards of 30 litres of distilled water passed
 through it. The <U+FB01>lter was then steam sterilised and employed for
the <U+FB01>ltration of some more of the same Thames water, which was
infected with typhoid and coli as below. Thus—
    (a.) Typhoid Bacillus—~20 needle-loops were taken from an agar
cultivation of the typhoid bacillus of nine days ago and introduced
into 50 c.c. of steam-sterilised water; after thoroughly shaking,
3 c.c. of this water-attenuation were added to 750 c.c. of the por
celain~<U+FB01>ltered Thames water.
    (12.) Bacillus coli communis.—The infection was made in exactly the
same way in every detail, the agar culture being also of the same
age.
    The waters thus infected with typhoid and coli respectively were
subdivided into smaller <U+FB02>asks, some of which were placed as usual in
the incubator at 19° C. and others in the refrigerator at 6—8° C.
The following results were obtained on examination :—

    Having, in the <U+FB01>rst series of experiments, determined the behaviour

 ceeded in the next instance to carry out a somewhat similar series 0
experiments with Loch Katrine water, which may be taken as a type
 of an upland surface water derived almost exclusively from unculti
vated land, and of a somewhat peaty character.
    The sample of Loch Katrine was collected from a tap on the main
in the Broomielaw, Glasgow, on June 30th, 1893.
    Submitted to plate cultivation on the spot, it was found to contain
112 bacteria in 1 c.c., whilst on chemical analysis it yielded the

    The cultures of the bacilli employed were on agar, and in both
cases twenty-eight days old.              In the case of the typhoid bacillus 1&0
needle-loops,      and  in  that    of  the     coli 25 loops, were taken from the
surface     of   the agar, removing           as   little of the culture-material as
possible. and introduced in each case into 50 c.c. of steam-sterilised
water, which was then violently shaken to ensure disintegration                             of
the bacterial masses.          The experimental waters were then infected
from these water-attenuations as follows :—

     These infected waters, after thorough agitation, were then, as in
 previous experiments, subdivided amongst a number of small sterile
 conical <U+FB02>asks, plugged with sterile cotton-wool ; in each case some of
 these <U+FB02>asks were placed in the incubator at 19° (3., Whilst others were
 kept in a refrigerator at 6—8° C. The uninfected unsterilised Loch
 Katrine water was also put into similar <U+FB02>asks, which were kept under
 precisely similar conditions for control.

then that distinct, but only very restricted, multiplication took place,
which was, as usual, followed by subsequent decline.

   In this  case there was   a very considerable increase in the total
number of bacteria present, due to the extensive multiplication of
the water bacteria, as shown by the great increase in the number of
liquefying colonies.   As this multiplication is much more marked
than in the uninfected water, it must obviously have been promoted
by the small quantity of organic matter unavoidably introduced along
with the typhoid bacilli.
    Similarly the plate cultivations of the unsterilised Loch Katrine
 water infected with the B. coli communis yielded the following
results :—

munis     in twenty-four hours, the uninfected and typhoid-infected
waters in forty-eight hours.
   Of the plate cnltivations prepared from these turbid broth-tubes,
it need only be stated that the plates from the tubes which had gone
turbid with typhoid-infected water, yielded characteristic typhoid
colonies which satis<U+FB01>ed all the several con<U+FB01>rmatory tests; similarly
the plates prepared from those broth-tubes which had been rendered
turbid by coli-infected water, yielded the characteristic colonies of the
B. coli communis, and also satis<U+FB01>ed the various con<U+FB01>rmatory tests.
On the other hand, those phenol broth-tubes which had become turbid
through the uninfected water, yielded colonies on the plates which
were small in the depth, and formed small pin-heads on the surface
of the gelatine, but did not give rise to the characteristic expan
sions, whilst on transferring these to potatoes, strong, highly-raised,
greyish growths, much more conspicuous than those of typhoid, were
                                             ~                     I
obtained.
   Thus on July 8, 1893, four days after infection, both the typhoid
 bacillus and the B. coli communis were proved to be still alive in the
 unsterilised Loch Katrine water.
   The second examination by phenol broth-culture was made on
 July 15, 1893, or eleven days after infection, with the following
results :—

it   willbe su<U+FB02>icient to say :—
      That from the uninfected water only liquefying colonies were

tioned, this organism      very frequently obtained in phenol broth

                                                                3
      The plates from the phenol broth-tube which had only been
     2.
rendered turbid in seventy-two hours by the incubator <U+FB02>ask of the
typhoid-infected water, yielded also only liquefying colonies, and
nothing like typhoid colonies was discoverable on the plates. The
corresponding broth-tube from the refrigerator <U+FB02>ask, on the other
hand, which had become turbid in twenty-four hours, yielded numer
ous small and expansion colonies which were undoubtedly due to
typhoid.

                                                                                                          '

     3.   The broth-tube, which had been rendered turbid in twenty-four
 hours with coli—infected water, yielded plates containing numerous
 depth and surface-expansion colonies, which were undoubtedly those
 of the B. coli communis.
     Thus from these examinations                     it was apparent that on       July    15, 1893,
 or eleven days after infection, the Bacillus coli communis was still alive
 in the unsterilised Loch Katrine water, as was also the typhoid bacillus
 in similar water which had been kept at the winter temperature of
 6—8° C., whilst in the water kept at a summer temperature of 19° 0. the
 typhoid bacillus was no longer discoverable.
     Another examination was made of these uninfected and infected
 unsterilised Loch Katrine waters on July 21, 1893, with the following
 results     :—

yielded the same results as those on July                            15, 1893 ;   thus no typhoid

   From these examinations it was evident, therefore, that the B. coli
communis was still alive in the unsterilised Loch Katrine waters (kept
both at winter and summer temperature) on July 21, 1893, or seventeen
days after infection ; the typhoid bacillus was also still alive in the similar
water kept at the winter temperature (6—8" 0.), whilst it was again, as
on the precious occasion (July 15, 1893), proved to be ewtinct     in the same
water kept at the summer temperature of 19° 0'.
     3. Bacteriological Examination of the Infected Sterilised Loch
                              Katrine Waters.
   With the preceding results must now be compared the behaviour
of the typhoid bacillus and the B. coli communis in the Loch Katrine
water which had been previously sterilised by steam and by <U+FB01>ltra
tion through porous porcelain respectively.
   These infected sterile waters were, as before, intended to show
whether these bacilli are capable of multiplication or not in water of
this character when the disturbing in<U+FB02>uence of the simultaneous
presence of other micro-organisms is removed.

   Thus in this steam-sterilised   Loch Katrine water the typhoid bacilli
underwent rapid degeneration,     the rate of their decline being more rapid
at   the summer    than  at   the  winter temperature ,- for at the higher
femperature they were no longer demonstrable seventeen days after in
fection, whilst at the lower temperature they were still just discoverable
even after twenty-one days.
   Essentially similar was the behaviour of the typhoid bacilli in the
Loch Katrine water which had been sterilised by <U+FB01>ltration through
porous porcelain, thus :—

     Thus again   in the Loch Katrine water, sterilised by <U+FB01>ltration through
porous porcelain, the typhoid bacilli underwent            rapid degeneration,
 more especially in the water which was preserved at the summer tempera
 ture, in which they were no longer found by plate cultivation twenty-one
 days after infection, whilst in the same water kept at the winter tempera
 ture   they were still easily recognisable, although   in greatly diminished
 numbers, on that day.
   It is particularly noteworthy that the behaviour of the typhoid bacilli
was practically identical in this Loch Katrine water, irrespectinely of
whether it was employed in the unsterilised or in the sterilised condition,
and irrewectioely of whether the sterilisation was ejfected by steam or by
<U+FB01>ltration through porous porcelain.
    In all cases, moreover, the ejfect of temperature on the typhoid bacillus
was very marked, the longevity being much greater in the Loch Katrine
water, unsterilised or sterilised, kept at the winter than in that kept at the
summer temperature.

waters is recorded in the following tables :—

   Thus in the steam-sterilised L. Katrine water, the B. coli communis
disappeared in a surprisingly short time, being no longer demonstrable
0n the 17th day after infection.  In this case also the decline was more
rapid  in the water kept at  a summer than in that at a winter tempera~
tare.
   Very similar again was the behaviour of the B. coli communis in
the L. Katrine water previously sterilised by <U+FB01>ltration through
porous porcelain, thus :—

  Thus again in the case of this porcelain-<U+FB01>ltered L. Katrine water there
was the same rapid disappearance of the introduced B. coli communis.
  It is particularly                 remarkable that the                         B. coli communis            has disappeared
more rapidly             in      both            these        sterile     L. Katrine          waters than         in the un
sterilised.
   Similar evidenco of the disappearance of the typhoid and coli
bacilli in these sterile L. Katrine waters is afforded by the results of

    These examinations by phenol broth-culture substantiate the results
 obtained by gelatine plates, and show that only a very small number
 of the bacilli were still living in the waters on the later dates. Thus,
 in the case of broth-tubes Nos. 199 and 200,           evident that in N o.                             it   is

                        2
 commum's was introduced, for the broth-tube became turbid; whilst
in N0. 200, in which only         c.c. of the same water was employed, no
                                                               1
living bacillus can have been introduced, as the broth-tube did not
become turbid.        On referring to the table of gelatine plate examina
tions (p. 483)       will be seen that on the same day (21.7.1893) in the
                        it
same water there was found only one B. coli communis colony per
1  c.c., so that     might easily happen that any particular
                        it                                        c.c. of the                                                    1
water might not contain any bacillus, as was apparently the case in
the  l  c.c. of this water added to the phenol broth-tube N0. 200.

    It  is in this way that particular   interest attaches to  a. comparison
of the results obtained by gelatine plate and phenol broth-culture in
the case of these infected sterile waters, as the two methods can be
made to control each other,       whilst in the    case of the infected un
sterilised waters the method of phenol broth-culture has to be exclu
sively relied on for the detection of the typhoid and coli bacilli.
      Behaviour of   the  Typhoid Bacillus in the Loch Katrine W'ater.
                        (Second Series of Experiments.)
    In    the <U+FB01>rst series of experiments    with  the  L. Katrine water re
corded above, the number of typhoid bacilli initially introduced was
so small that it would obviously not be possible to directly compare
the results with those previously obtained with Thames water in
which a much larger number of typhoid bacilli were initially intro
 duced, as I have found in previous investigations of the same kind
that one of the factors determining the longevity of pathogenic
bacteria placed in water, or for the matter of that placed in any un
favourable surroundings, is the absolute number in which they are
present.      In other words, amongst, for instance, 1,000 bacteria taken
 from a given source there may be some individuals which will resist a
 particular adverse in<U+FB02>uence, whilst amongst 10 bacteria taken from
 the same source there may be none capable of resisting the adverse
 in<U+FB02>uence in question.                          _
     When, therefore, I found that such a small number of typhoid
 bacilli had been introduced into the L. Katrine water in the <U+FB01>rst
 series of experiments, I immediately started a second series of ex
 periments      with the same water, but introducing a much larger
 number of typhoid bacilli.
     In this second series of Loch Katrine experiments, which were
 begun on 7.7.1893, or three days after the <U+FB01>rst, only unsterilised
 Loch Katrine water was infected with typhoid, thus :—
     Infectfon of L. Katrine Water in Second Series of Experiments.—
  25 needle-loops were taken from the surface of an agar-culture of the
 typhoid bacillus, 11 days old, and introduced into 20 c.c. of steam
  steriliscd tap-water, which was then violently shaken for 15 minutes ;
  10 c.c. of this water-attenuation were then added to 1500            c.c. of
  unsterilised L. Katrine water. After thorough mixture this was
  divided up amongst a number of sterilised <U+FB02>asks plugged with sterile
  cotton-wool, which were placed in the incubator (19° C.) and re
  frigerator (6—8° C.) respectively.         Control <U+FB02>asks containing the
  same unsterilised L. Katrine water, but uninfected, were placed
  under precisely similar conditions.
      The results of bacteriological examination of the uninfected control
  L. Katrine water are given in the following table :—

   Thus in these uninfected L. Katrine waters only comparatively
slight multiplication took place, and at no time were there more than
a few colonies causing liquefaction of the gelatine.
   With these must now be compared the L. Katrine water infected
with typhoid, the results obtained with which are recorded in the
table (pl 488).
   These examinations show that although the water-bacteria present
in the unsterilised L. Katrine water must have undergone consider
able multiplication, as shown by the great increase in the liquefying
colonies, yet this multiplication   did not by any means keep pace
with the decrease in the number of typhoid bacilli; for the total
number of colonies on the successive plates underwent continuous
decline.        ,
   The actual proof of the persistence of the typhoid bacillus in these
waters had of course to be furnished by the method of phenol broth
culture.   Thus

    Thus when       the typhoid   bacilli were introduced      into the L. Katrine
water    in  large numbers, they were     still easily discoverable by phenol broth
culture on the fourteenth day, although from the examinations              by plate
cultication (see p. 488) it is obvious that their numbers had undergone
enormous diminution.          They doubtless persisted even longer than this, but
the experiments had to be interrupted.             Thus when introduced in large
numbers       their persistence is greater than when only small numbers are
employed, for in the previous experiments they were no more demonstr
able   in  the unsterilised  water which had been kept at a summer tempera
ture (19° C.)      for 11 days (see p.   4176).
     COMPARATIVE       BEHAVIOUR or THE TYPHOID BACILLUS IN THAMES,
                     Loon KATRINE, AND DEEP WELL WATER.
    The previous experiments had clearly shown that the typhoid
bacillus, although unable to multiply in either ordinary Thames or
L. Katrine water, even when these waters are deprived of other
competing or inimical bacteria, is yet able to remain alive for con
siderable periods of time in these waters, not only when they are
previously sterilised, but even, although for a distinctly shorter
period, in their unsterilised condition and                in the presence of an
                                                       '
abundant bacterial population.
    Inasmuch as the access of typhoid bacilli to potable water of all
kinds is one of the most ever-present dangers to the public health,
it becomes a matter of pressing hygienic importance to determine
whether the particular kind of water into which they may gain access
affects the chance of their reaching the water-consumer in a living
state.      The population of the United Kingdom is chie<U+FB02>y supplied
with one or other of .three different kinds of water, of which the
 Thames, L. Katrine, and deep-well water of the Kent Company may
 be taken as types, and it is with these three types of water that                  I
 have, therefore, instituted the comparison in question.
     From the experiments which I have detailed above, it is obvious
 that the longevity of the typhoid bacillus in any particular water is
 subject to very considerable variations according to the initial
 vitality of the typhoid bacillus employed, and according as a rela
 tively large or small number of the bacilli is introduced into the
 water. In order, therefore, to institute a comparison between several
 different waters as to their relative capacity of maintaining the
 typhoid bacilli in a living state, it is absolutely essential that the
 typhoid bacilli placed in the several waters should be taken from one
 and the same cultivation, and that they should be introduced in each
 case in as far as possible the same numbers.
     These were the conditions which were secured in the series of com
  parative experiments made with these three di<U+FB02>'erent types of water,
  and. which are now to be described.

     Each of these waters was, in this comparative series, simulta
 neously experimented with in the natural unsterilised state, also
 after sterilisation by steam, as well as after sterilisation by <U+FB01>ltration
 through a porous cylinder composed of baked infusorial earth. These
 nine different kinds of water were all infected at one time with the
 same quantity of typhoid bacilli taken from one and the same culti
 vation.
    For this purpose an agar-cultivation of sixteen days’ age, and
 grown at 18—20°‘ 0., was employed.       Forty needle loops were care
 fully  taken   from  the  surface of this cultivation and thoroughly
 mixed by prolonged agitation with 50 c.c. of sterilised tap-water.’
 Of the water-attenuation thus prepared 4: c.c. were added to 1000 c.c..

purposes of this kind. All these <U+FB02>asks, together with similar <U+FB02>askslI
 containing each of the three unsterilised waters not infected, were?
placed in a dark cupboard in which there prevailed an almost uni-l
form temperature of 9—12° C.                                               .l
    In this series of experiments, besides determining the relative'l
longevity of the typhoid bacilli in the several diiferent types _          of}
potable water,I    have also endeavoured to ascertain the effect on th
bacteria 'of keeping the waters at rest and in motion respectively
To this end, in the case of each water, one <U+FB02>ask was kept at rest and};
only shaken up when a sample was to be taken from it, whilst the;
other <U+FB02>ask was daily submitted to violent agitation over a period of
<U+FB01>ve minutes, this agitation being repeated two or three times on the
same day.     The convention will be adopted in the following pages of
referring to the <U+FB02>asks kept at rest by the letter A, whilst those which
were subjected to daily agitation are distinguished by the letter B.
   The various waters were periodically examined both by plate»
cultivation and phenol-broth culture on the same lines as described
for the previousseries of experiments.
  The uninfected waters yielded the following       results on chemical:

        typhoid-infected.     water,  although  the  total number    of  bacteria de
        blined,  it  is  certain that  the water-bacteria   underwent    considerable
        imultiplication, as there was a. great increase in the number of lique
        fy'ing colonies; the diminution in the total number of bacteria was
        due to the disappearance of the typhoid bacilli which were initially
        present to the extent of about 16,000 per c.c.             It will be shown
        (p. 508)    that  typhoid bacilli were no longer  demonstrable  in this water
        by phenol broth culture after 28.10.1893, or nine days after their intro

   From   the above tables  it will be seen that the bacteria in the unin
fected Loch Katrine water underwent no multiplication, but, on the
contrary, slight decline. In the infected water the initial number of
typhoid bacilli must have amounted to about 22,000 per c.c., and
although the total number of bacteria. in this infected water under
went a great decline, there can be no doubt that the water-bacteria
multiplied considerably, as was evidenced by the increased number of
liquefying colonies, the diminution in the total number of bacteria
being doubtless due to the disappearance of the typhoid bacilli.        It
will be shown on p. 511 that the typhoid bacilli were discovered for the
last time by the method of phenol broth culture on 7.11.1893, or nineteen
days after their <U+FB01>rst introduction.

   From   the above tables it will be seen that the water-bacteria in the
deep    well water underwent much more extensive multiplication
than in either the Thames or Loch Katrine water.           This extensive
multiplication    of the  bacteria  in  such  deep well  water   was <U+FB01>rst
called attention to by me in 1886 (‘Proc. Roy. Soc.’).            The in
fected water must have contained, initially, about 28,000 typhoid
bacilli per c.c., and in this infected water the increase in the total
number of bacteria was even more marked than in the uninfected,
the increase in the number of liquefying colonies being altogether
enormous.     The behaviOur of the typhoid bacilli in the sterile deep
well water (see p. 505) clearly shows that they cannot have partici
pated in this bacterial multiplication observed in the infected un
sterilised deep well water, but on the contrary they must have un
dergone great diminution, as it will be shown on p. 515 that the
typhoid bacilli were no longer discovered by phenol broth culture in
this water after 21.11.1893, 0r thirty-three days after their <U+FB01>rst intro—
duction.

   From the above tables       it will be seen that in the steam sterilised
 Thames water the typhoid bacilli underwent no multiplication, but, on
the contrary, steady diminution, being last discovered on 20.11.1893, or
thirty-two  days after their <U+FB01>rst introduction.
   In the Thames water, sterilised by <U+FB01>ltration, their disappearance was
far more rapid, for they were no longer discoverable eleven days after
 their introduction, and they had doubtless died of even before this.
 These results entirely con<U+FB01>rm my previous experiences         recorded on
 p. 464, and the con<U+FB01>rmation is of the more importance, as the <U+FB01>lters
 used in the two cases were entirely di<U+FB01>erent ; thus whilst that used on
 the former occasion was a. Chamberland cylinder of porous porcelain,
 the one used in this latter instance was a small porous cylinder con
 structed of infusorial earth. These infusorial earth cylinders are
 much more porous than the porcelain ones, and pass the water far
 more rapidly.

   The above tables show that in       the  steam-sterilised Loch Katrine
water, the typhoid bacilli again underwent no multiplication, but on the
contrary steady decline, the last surviving individuals being, however,
remarkably persistent.   Thus the typhoid bacilli were still discoverable
on 9.12.1893, or <U+FB01>fty-one days after their <U+FB01>rst introduction.     This is a
much longer survival than in the case either of the steam-sterilised

   In the Loch Katrine water, rendered sterile by <U+FB01>ltration, the typhoid
bacilli also survived much longer than in either the similarly treated
Thames or deep well waters,      the bacilli being still discovered      on.

viz., that the typhoid bacilli persisted much longer in the porcelain
<U+FB01>ltered Loch Katrine than in the porcelain-<U+FB01>ltered Thames water.

   From    the above tables  it is  seen that  in  the steam-sterilised   deep
well water also  the typhoid  bacilli were incapable   of multiplication, and,
on the contrary, underwent continuous decline in numbers; they were
last discovered on 8.11.1893, or twenty days ajter their introduction,
whilst on 20.11.1893, or after being in the water for thirty-two days, they
were no longer discoverable by plate-cultivation.     In this connection it
is particularly noteworthy       that   the typhoid bacilli were still dis
covered on 21.11.1893 in the unsterilised deep well water, thus show
ing that in this deep well water their longevity was una<U+FB01>'ected by the
circumstance of whether the water was sterilised or unsterilised.       In the
case of both the Thames and Loch Katrine waters, on the other
hand, the longevity of the typhoid bacilli was much greater in the
sterilised than in the unsterilised water.
   This circumstance is particularly instructive and important, inas
much as it was just in this typhoid-infected unsterilised deep well
water that the water bacteria present multiplied most extensively.
and yet this large multiplication of the common water forms did not
prejudicially a<U+FB01>ect the typhoid bacilli.
   This deep well water, on the other hand, is in the sterilised cou
ditiou less favourable to the longevity of the typhoid bacilli than
the sterilised Thames and Loch Katrine waters, for in these three
steam-sterilised waters the introduced typhoid bacilli disappeared
<U+FB01>rst in the deep well and last in the Loch Katrine water, their
longevity in the steam-sterilised Thames water being greater
than in the deep well and less than in the Loch Katrine water.
 (For further remarks on this behaviour see p. 517.)
    In the deep well water sterilised by <U+FB01>ltration through porous por
celain (in this case again infusorial earth), the typhoid bacilli again
disappeared with remarkable promptitude, being no longer dis
coverable eleven days after their introduction.
    In order to ascertain whether these waters sterilised by <U+FB01>ltration
through porous cylinders owed the rapid disappearance of the
typhoid and coli bacilli which almost invariably occurred in them to
the presence of any antiseptic substance possessing general bacteri
cidal properties, the following experiment was made :—
   The typhoid-infected porcelain-<U+FB01>ltered deep well water referred to
above, and in which the typhoid bacillus was proved to be extinct on
30.10.1893, and 8.11.1893 respectively (see Table, p. 505), was on
 11.11.1893 treated with three drops of the unsterilised uninfected
deep well water.      These three drops of unsterile water must have
contained about 3000 water bacteria, as calculated from the results
of plate cultivation given in the table on p. 499, and, as the volume of
<U+FB01>ltered water to which these three drops were added was about
 100 c.c., the latter must have acquired about thirty water bacteria
per 1 c.c. by the addition.

                 Report on the Bacteriology    of Water.                507
   This porcelain-<U+FB01>ltered deep well water, to which the three drops of
unsterile deep well water were thus added on 11.11.1893, was ex
amined by plate cultivation on 14.11.1893, or three days after the
addition, and was then found to contain 10,462 bacteria per 1 c.c. ; it was
again examined on 23.11.1893, or twelve clays after the addition, and then
contained 603,900 bacteria.   It is obvious, therefore, that in this same
water   in which the typhoid bacilli were destroyed with such remarkable
rapidity,  some at any rate of the common water bacteria present in the
unsterile deep well water were able to multiply both to an enormous extent
and with wonderful celerity.   This result dismisses, in my opinion, the
last lurking suspicion which might still remain of any antiseptic
substance having accidentally gained access to the water in the
process of <U+FB01>ltration through these porous cylinders.

   From the <U+FB01>rst table it will be seen that             the Thames water the
typhoid bacilli were demonstrable on 28.10.1893, i.e., nine days after
their introduction, but already four days later, and afterwards, all
endeavours to discover the typhoid bacillus proved abortive.
   From the second table, on the other hand. it will be seen           that in
the Loch Katrine water     the presence of  the  typhoid bacillus was demon
strable on   7.11.1893,  i.e., nineteen days after its introduction, whilst
on 21.11.1893, 0r fourteen days later, and afterwards, it could no more
be discovered.
   From the third table, again, it will be seen that in the deep-well
water   the typhoid    bacilli were easily discoverable on 7.11.1893, i.e.,
nineteen days after their introduction,           and just discoverable     on
21.11.1893, 0r thirty-three      days after their introduction, whilst, six
days later and thereafter, all attempts to demonstrate their presence
proved fruitless.
   As regards the effect of agitation in these experiments, it appears
that the agitation on the whole promoted the multiplication of the
water bacteria in the unsterilised waters, whilst it somewhat acceler
ated the disappearance of the typhoid bacilli in the infected sterile
waters.    These results partially con<U+FB01>rm those obtained by Professor
Ray Lankester in some similar experiments described by him to the
recent Royal Commission on the London Water Supply (Appendix,
p. 455).
   In his experiments 2 litres of sterilised river water were placed in
two similar jars, and each was similarly infected with the typhoid
bacillus. One of the jars was then syringed four times an hour for
twelve hours, and, after an interval, for eight hours more. The other
jar was left undisturbed in the dark. The syringed jars showed a
very marked inferiority in the number of typhoid germs obtained on
cultivation, amounting to a reduction of one-half.
   In my experiments the difference between the waters kept at rest
and those submitted to agitation was not nearly so marked, which
may possibly be due to the dilierent mode of agitation employed, and
also to the fact that the waters were not examined so soon after
the agitation, for it is quite possible         that the combined effect of
agitation and oxygenation makes itself felt more in the <U+FB01>rst in
stance than later on.
   In the case of the infected unsterilised waters, again, there is
considerable evidence that the agitation hastened the disappearance
of the typhoid bacilli.      Thus in the case of the unsterile Thames water,

                       Report on the Bacteriology      of lVater.              517
   the typhoid     bacilli were discovered  on 28.10.1893, or eight days after
'  infection  in  the <U+FB02>ask  which  was kept at 'rest, whilst they were not demon
   strable on the same day in the case of the <U+FB02>ask which had been subjected
   to agitation.
      In    the    unsterile   Loch Katrine water, again,            although on
   7.11.1893     typhoid bacilli were found both in the water which had
   been kept at rest and in that which had been agitated, yet the
   broth-tube with <U+FB01>ve drops of the phenol solution only became turbid
   in the case of the water which had remained at rest, thus tending to
  show that the typhoid bacilli were more numerous or in a more active
  condition in this latter water than in that which had been agitated.
      From the experiments made with the sterilised Thames, Katrine,
   and deep well waters, it is evident that in none of these waters does
  the typhoid bacillus proliferate, the longevity of the bacilli being
  greatest in the Katrine and least in the deep-well water; on the
  other hand, in the unsterilised waters their longevity is decidedly
  greatest in the deep-well, and decidedly least in the Thames, water.
      In the sterilised water the principal factor determining longevity
  would, therefore, appear to be the proportion of organic matter
  present, which is much greater in the Loch Katrine and Thames than
  in the deep well water; on the other hand, in the unsterilised water
  the factor determining longevity must be an entirely different one;
  and whatever it may be, it is more conspicuous in the case of the
  two surface (Thames and Loch Katrine) than in that of the subter
  ranean (deep well) water. It is, as has already been frequently indi
  cated,     generally believed that the more rapid disappearance                of
  pathogenic bacteria in unsterile than in sterile waters is due to the
  multiplication or competition of the common water bacteria in the
  unsterile waters; but these experiments clearly show that this cannot
  be true, at any rate without some quali<U+FB01>cation, for by reference to
  the tables on pp. 495, 497, and 499, it will be seen that it was precisely
  in the case of the deep well water that the most extensive multiplica
  tion of the water bacteria took place.               In this connection it is
  interesting     to  compare   the  following statement made by Professor
  Ray Lankester, F.R.S., to the recent Royal Commission on the London
  Water Supply (Appendix, p. 458) :—
        I
      “ took pure cultures of a very active and common <U+FB02>uviatile form,
  B. <U+FB02>uorescens liquefaciens, which suggested, by its vigorous action on
  gelatine, the possession of destructive properties. With this           I mixed
  it pure culture of Bacillus typhosus, and studied the mixed culture,
  both by drop culture under the microscope and in the tube.               During
  a fortnight no diminution of the activity or numbers of either species
  was observed.         1 have experimented with pure cultures of other
  fluviatile species, and intend to continue the observations.               It is
  possible—indeed        not improbable—that       one  or more   species may be

 518           Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
discovered which are injurious to, or destructive of, B. typhosus, but
 I have not yet succeeded in establishing the fact.”
    It naturally suggests itself that possibly the particular kinds of
 water bacteria present in the three different kinds of water experi
 mented with may have in<U+FB02>uenced the relative longevity of the
 typhoid bacillus in these three waters respectively. With a View to
putting this supposition to the test, the following series of experi
 ments were made      :—
    (a.) One portion of the typhoid-infected steam-sterilised Thames
         water was inoculated with a few drops of unsterilised Thames
         water, a second portion with a few drops of unsterilised Loch
         Katrine water, and a third portion with a few drops of un
         sterilised deep well water.
    (6.) One portion of the typhoid-infected steam-sterilised Loch
         Katrine water was inoculated with a few drops of unsterilised
         Thames water, a second portion with a few drops of unsteri
         lised Loch Katrine water, and a third portion with a few  I drops
         of unsterilised deep well water.
   (0.) One portion of the typhoid-infected steam-sterilised deep well
         water was inoculated with a few drops of unsterilised Thames
         water, a second portion with a few drops of unsterilised Loch
         Katrine water, and a third portion with a few drops of unsteri
         lised deep well water.
   Unfortunately,     this series of experiments was only commenced on
 16.11.1893, when the number        of typhoid bacilli in the three steam
sterilised waters had got very low (see Tables, pp. 501, 503, 505). In all
instances there was an enormous multiplication of the water bacteria
introduced in- the few drops of unsterilised water added in each case,
but owing to the small number of typhoid bacilli present, it was not
possible to establish whether the rate of their disappearance was
differently affected by the multiplication of the water bacteria from
the unsterile Thames, Loch Katrine, or deep well water respec
tively.
   Owing to the failure of the above series of experiments to deter
mine whether the undoubtedly greater bactericidal properties of the
unsterilised over the sterilised waters are due to the multiplication of
the contained water bacteria, or to some other cause, the following
fresh series of experiments was conducted on Thames water alone
with the object of elucidating the same point.

    WATER REINOCULATED WITH THAMES WATER. BACTERIA.                 (11.1.1894.)
    In this series of experiments one portion of a sample of Thames
water collected at Hampton on January 9th, 1894, was infected with
typhoid in the natural unsterile condition, a second portion was
similarly infected after having been previously sterilised by steaming,
and a portion of the latter was again supplied with the Thames water
bacteria by inoculating it with a few drops of the same unsterilised
Thames water.
   Infection of the Waters.—I have found in the previous series of ex
periments that, in taking the surface-growth from a well-matured
typhoid culture, a large proportion of the bacilli are dead, whilst
even those which are alive are often in a more or less weakened
state.                       I
          On this account now generally prefer to take the bacilli for
experiments such as these directly from fresh plate cultivations,
selecting the largest and most vigorous looking colonies.
    In the present series of experiments a gelatine plate culture (<U+FB01>ve
days old) of the typhoid bacillus was employed; <U+FB01>fty-seven surface
colonies were carefully removed by means of a sterile platinum loop and
transferred to 50 c.c. of steam-sterilised Thames water in a small
sterile-stoppered bottle; this was then violently shaken for <U+FB01>fteen
minutes as usual, measured quantities of this liquid being then used
for the infection of the large volumes of water. Thus, 800 c.c. of
steam-sterilised Thames water were infected with 8 c.c. of the above
liquid, 400 c.c. of this was kept, and will be referred to in the follow
ing experiments as
            “                                         Thames Water.”
              Typhoid~infected Steam-sterilised
    To the remaining 400 c.c. was added 1 c.c. of the unsterilised
Thames water, with the object of imparting to it the several kinds of
water bacteria in Thames water. This portion will be referred to in
the following experiments as
   “                     Steam-sterilised   Thames Water inoculated with a
     Typhoid-infected
                    few drops of Unsterile Thames Water.”
    Again, 400 c.c. of unsterilised Thames water were inoculated with
4 c.c. of the water attenuation of typhoid mentioned above, and this
will be referred to in the following pages as
              “                      Unsterilised   Thames Water.’;

   Bearing in mind (see table, p. 520) that the uninfected unsterilised
Thames water contained about 5000 water bacteria in           c.c. 0n the      1
day of infection,      evident that about 170,000 typhoid bacilli per
                         it   is
c.c. were introduced.    The periodical examinations recorded above
show that these numbers steadily declined, and from the character of
the colonies obtained on the plates,    appears that the water bacteria
                                                    it
underwent   no marked   multiplication, thus, no increase in the number
of liquefying colonies was observed.    The gradual diminution in the
total number of colonies obtained may be ascribed, therefore, to the
dying off of the 170,000 typhoid bacilli per c.c. introduced (see also
results of phenol broth-culture experiments, p. 525, et seq).

underwent a gradual decline, the slight increase on 22.1.1894 being,

causes as indicated above.    The typhoid bacilli were still abundantly
present thirty-nine days after their <U+FB01>rst introduction.          attribute   I
this greater longevity in this series of experiments partly to the fact

   The 115,000 bacteria per 1 c.c. contained in this water must have
been almost exclusively typhoid bacilli, for, after infection with
typhoid, 400 c.c. were inoculated with 1 c.c. of unsterile Thames
water. Now, this unsterile water, as seen from table, p.520, con
tained about 5000 water bacteria per 1 0.0.; 5000 water bacteria
must thus have been added to 400 c.c. of this typhoid-infected steam
sterilised Thames water, which would thus-contain about twelve
water bacteria per 1 c.c. in addition to the typhoid bacilli with which
it had been previously infected. These few water bacteria must have
undergone rapid and extensive multiplication, for, on 22.1.1894, a

very large number of <U+FB02>uorescent liquefying colonies was found on
the plates, and in all the subsequent examinations of this water
numerous liquefying colonies were also present, thus clearly showing
that the diminution in the total number of colonies found in the
successive plates must have been in large measure due to the dying
off of the typhoid bacilli.
    Thus, whilst in the case of the simply typhoid-infected unsterilised
 Thames water there is no evidence (see table, p. 521) of multiplication
 of the contained water bacteria having taken place, in this typhoid
 infected steam-sterilised Thames water, to which a few water bacteria
 had been added, there is evidence of abundant multiplication of these
 water bacteria having occurred, and it becomes a matter of the
 greatest importance to ascertain in which of these two waters the
 typhoid bacilli (present in each case in approximately the same
 numbers and having exactly the same origin and history) exhibited
 the greater longevity.    This question was determined by means of
 the examinations by phenol broth-culture, the results of which are
 recorded in the following tables :—

528        Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall \Vard.
  The above table clearly shows
 (1.) That the uninfected unsterilised Thames water contained no bac
      teria which could be mistaken for typhoid bacilli by the methods
      of investigation employed.        The phenol broth-tubes which
      became turbid on inoculation with this water were always
      found by plate cultivation to yield colonies which have all the
      appearance    of the B. liquidus formerly described by me
       (‘Zeitschrift fiir Hygiene,’ vol. 6, 1889; ‘Roy. Soc. Proo.,’
      vol. 53, 1893, p. 186).    In all these experiments in which the
      method of phenol broth-culture has been employed, 1 have
      repeatedly found that this same organism succeeds in develop
      ing in the broth to which three drops of the phenol solution
      per 10 c.c. of broth are added.
 (2.) That the typhoid-infected steam-sterilised Thames water con
      tained living typhoid bacilli throughout the entire period of
      forty-eight days (January 16th—March 5th, 1894) over which
      this series of experiments extended.
 (3.) That    in the typhoid-infected unsterilised Thames water, the
      typhoid bacilli were still demonstrable on 5.2.1894, or twenty
      days after their introduction;        but seven days later, on
      12.2.1894, they were no longer discoverable.
 (4.) That in the typhoid-infected steam-sterilised       Thames water,
      which had been furnished with the Thames water bacteria by in
      oculating with a few drops of unsterilised Thames water, the
      typhoid bacilli were still demonstrable on 19.2.1894, or thirty
      four days after their introduction, whilst seven days later, on
      26.2.1894, they were no longer discoverable.
 (5.) Thus, not' only was the longevity of the typhoid bacilli far
      greater, as usual, in the sterilised than in the unsterile waters,
      but of the two unsterile waters, the one naturally so, and the
      other rendered unsterile by the inoculation of a few drops of
      unsterile Thames water, the naturally unsterile one proved to
      be decidedly more antagonistic to the vitality of the typhoid
      bacillus, than the water rendered arti<U+FB01>cially unsterile, as We
      may call  it, by inoculation with unsterile Thames water.
 (6.) This result     the more signi<U+FB01>cant and important, inasmuch as
                      is
      it was shown (see p. 521) that in the naturally unsterile water
      no multiplication of the water bacteria took place, whilst. in
      what we may call the arti<U+FB01>cially unsterile water,  it  was shown
      (see p. 523)  that a very large multiplication  of the introduced
      water bacteria certainly did take place.
 (7.) In the previous series of experiments (see p. 516)        it  was
      equally clearly shown that the typhoid bacilli enjoyed           a
      greater longevity in the unsterile deep well water than in

                  Report on the Bacteriology of Water.                 529
        either'the unsterile Thames or Loch Katrine waters, although
        it was precisely in the deep well water that the water bacteria
        underwent multiplication.
   (8.) These experimental observations lead me to the conclusion
    ’
        that the antagonistic action of the unsterile waters on the
        typhoid bacillus is not to be attributed to the multiplication
        of the water bacteria leading to the suppression of the typhoid
        bacilli “by competition in the struggle for existence,” to use
        the common phraseology of many writers on these subjects,
        but through the existence in the unsterile waters of conditions
         (due, doubtless, to a great extent to the presence of chemical
        products elaborated by water bacteria) which are inimical to
        the vitality of the typhoid bacillus.
   That conditions inimical    to the vitality of the typhoid bacillus  can
be generated by the water bacteria alone    is demonstrated by the above
experiments in which a few drops of unsterile Thames water were
added to the typhoid-infected steam-sterilised water, with the result
that the longevity of the typhoid bacilli in this water was far less
than in the steam-sterilised water itself.
   That the longevity of the typhoid bacillus is still less in the natur
ally unsterile water than in that rendered unsterile by inoculation,       I
attribute to the fact that in the naturally unsterile Thames water,
countless generations of water bacteria have <U+FB02>ourished before the
water is made the subject of experiment at all, and it must, therefore,
be more or less saturated with those bacterial products which are
prejudicial to the vitality of the typhoid bacillus, and which, in fact,
frequently hamper or even inhibit the further multiplication of the
water bacteria themselves.
   The deep well water, on the other hand, in its natural condition is
in a very di<U+FB01>erent state; as my numerous former examinations (see
Second Report, pp. 178—180) of this water have shown, it is drawn
from its subterranean source in an almost perfectly sterile condition,
having never since its exhaustive <U+FB01>ltration through the porous strata of
the earth, in which it has altogether altered its chemical composition,
harboured any micro-organisms at all, so that the abundant bacterial
                            I
multiplication, which, as have shown, it exhibits in the laboratory,
is really the <U+FB01>rst time that it is subjected to the in<U+FB02>uence of bacterial
growth, and it takes a correspondingly longer time, therefore, for the
conditions inimical to the typhoid bacillus to be established.     In fact,
in the experiments with deep well water (see pp. 505, 5l5) the
typhoid bacillus was actually discovered in the unsterile water alittle
later than in the steam-sterilised water. That the multiplication of the
bacteria in the deep well water does not lead to conditions so antago
nistic to the vitality of the typhoid bacillus is also, no doubt, attri

530              Profs. Percy        F rankland and Marshall Ward.
butable to the circumstance that the number of di<U+FB01>erent kinds of
bacteria in the deep well water is much more limited than in ordinary
surface waters.
    For the practical hygienic application of these experimental
observations, reference should be made to the-<U+FB01>nal conclusions at the
end of this Report, see p. 543.
Further Experiments on the In<U+FB02>uence of the Addition of Common Salt
                      to Water containing the Typhoid Bacillus.
    The several waters prepared for the last series of experiments were
also made to serve the purpose of verifying the remarkable results
previously obtained (see p. 434, et seq.) by the addition of common
salt to typhoid-infected waters.
    These     experiments were commenced on 12.2.1894, on which day
some of each of the following waters (for full particulars concerning
them, see p. 519) received 1 per cent. of pure sterile sodium chloride
respectively :—
    (a.) Typhoid-infected          steam-sterilised       Thames water.
    (1).)  Typhoid-infected         steam-sterilised Thames water, inoculated             with
              a few drops of unsterile Thames water.
    (0.)   Uninfected unsterilised Thames water.
    (d.) Typhoid-infected          unsterilised       Thames water.
    These waters, to each of which                  1  per cent. of sodium chloride had
been added, were preserved in a dark cupboard at a temperature of
9—11° 0., and were submitted to periodical examination along with
the several        waters    of the last series, with which they were to be
compared.

   On comparing this table with the one on p. 520, which refers to the
same water, only without the addition of salt, it will be seen that the
e<U+FB01>ect of the salt addition was to cause an enormous and rapid multi
plication of the water bacteria. The liquefying colonies underwent
great multiplication, but there was also an enormous increase in other
non-liquefying colonies of various kinds.

  On comparing the above table with that on p. 521, it will be seen
what an enormous multiplication of the bacteria present was caused
by the addition of the salt; in this case the multiplication was not so
much shared in by the liquefying organisms as by the others.

     On referring to the table on p. 523, it will be seen that in this
water, before the addition of the salt, a considerable multiplication of
 the water bacteria had taken place, but at the time the salt was added,
 the total number of bacteria only amounted to from 2000—5000 per
 1 c.c. ; after the addition of the salt, however, an enormous multipli
 cation followed.
     We must now see how the vitality of the typhoid bacilli was
 affected by this enormous bacterial multiplication which took place
 in the unsterile waters after the 1 per cent. of common salt was added
 to them.      This was, of course, ascertained by the method of phenol
 broth-culture, the results of which are recorded in the following

  The above table should be compared with that on p. 525 ct seq.,
which refers to the same waters only without the addition of salt. It
will then be seen :—
  (1.) That in the typhoid-infected           unsterilised   Thames water, the
          typhoid bacilli      had   already disappeared on 12.2.1894, t.e.,
          before the addition of salt was made at all, and, therefore,
          that no inferences can be drawn as to the ellect of the salt
          on the typhoid bacilli in this unsterilised water. Of course
          the absence of typhoid in this unsterile water was not
          ascertained until more than a week after this date,
          12.2.1894, on which the salt was added, otherwise the
          experiment would not have been made at all.
  (2.)  In   the  typhoid-infected     steam-stem'lised Thames water, inocu
          lated   with a few drops of unsterile Thames, the typhoid
          bacilli   were   still demonstrable on 19.2.1894, but not on
          26.2.1894,   whilst in the same water, to which 1 per cent. of
          salt was added      on    12.2.1894, the typhoid bacilli   were dis
          coverable   still on 14.2.1894, but not on 1.9.2.1894.     Thus the
          addition of the salt considerably hastened the disappearance
          of the typhoid bacilli from what may be called this arti
          <U+FB01>cially unsterile Thames water.
  (3.) As already shown by the results of plate cultivation given on
          p. 531, the addition of the 1 per cent. of salt to the
          typhoid-infected     steam-sterilised Thames water, caused a very
          rapid diminution in the number of typhoid bacilli present,
          and these results are entirely con<U+FB01>rmed by the results
          on cultivation with phenol broth.               Thus, the last plate
          cultivation, made on 24.2.1894, revealed the presence of only
          six typhoid bacilli in 1 c.c., phenol broth-culture still showed
          the presence of typhoid on 26.2.1894, but no more on
          5.3.1894, although in the same water, which had not been
          treated with sodium chloride, the typhoid bacilli were easily
          discoverable by phenol broth-culture on that day.
  (4.)  There    can be no doubt, therefore, that common salt, whilst
          enormously stimulating the multiplication of many forms of
          water bacteria, exerts a directly and highly prejudicial e<U+FB02>ect
          on the typhoid bacilli, causing their rapid disappearance
          from the water whether water bacteria are present or not.
  (5.) It is worthy of remark that the typhoid colonies obtained on
          plate cultivation of the phenol-broth tubes which had been
          rendered turbid by these infected saline waters exhibited in
          some cases a very abnormal appearance, being irregularly
          swollen and lobulated in the depth and often giving rise to
          whip-like prolongations into the surrounding gelatine. As

536         Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
          far  as  I am  aware, such abnormally formed typhoid colonies
          have    not been previously observed, and    I am inclined to
          attribute them to the degeneration of the typhoid bacilli. for,
          on passing such colonies through a further process of plate
          cultivation, only the normally formed typhoid colonies were
          obtained.
On the‘_Possibility    of the Typhoid Bacillus or the B. coli communis
                        multiplying in Potable Water.
   In none of the several series of experiments with Thames, Loch
Katrine, and deep well (chalk) water, already recorded, was there any
evidence of the typhoid bacillus undergoing           any multiplication
whatsoever; on the contrary, in all cases in which the typhoid bacillus
was introduced into these waters in a sterilised condition there was a
more or less rapid diminution in its numbers observed.       In the case
of the B. coli communis, in the steam-sterilised Thames water (p. 454),
there was considerable multiplication of the B. coli communis observed
when the water was kept at a summer, but practically none when it
was maintained at the winter, temperature; on the other hand, in the
steam-sterilised Loch Katrine water (see p. 481) the B. coli communis
did not exhibit any numerical increase, but, on the contrary, rapid
decline.
   Of the waters experimented with above, the Thames water contains
about the average quantity of organic matter present in those surface
waters from cultivated land which are supplied for domestic purposes,
whilst similarly the extremely small proportion of organic matter in
the Kent well water is typical of the water supplied from deep
wells; on the other hand, the Loch Katrine water contains decidedly
less organic matter than is usually present in the water supplied to
towns from upland surface sources.        Now, although the experiments
which have been detailed above conclusively show that the typhoid
bacillus does not proliferate in the Thames, deep well, or Loch
Katrine water employed, it appeared to me to be of importance to
ascertain whether in upland surface water, more highly impregnated
with organic matter than is the case with that from Loch Katrine,
such\proliferation of the typhoid bacillus might not perhaps take
place.
   For this purpose I employed, as specially <U+FB01>tted for the object in
view, some moorland surface water which is supplied to a large manu
facturing population in North Britain, and which the following
analysis shows is very highly charged with organic matter of a peaty
character :—

    One part of this peaty water was sterilised by steaming, and
another part by <U+FB01>ltration through       porous cylinder (Chamber-land
                                              a
<U+FB01>lter), and each of these sterilised waters was divided into two parts,
which were respectively infected with the typhoid bacillus and with
the B. coli communis on 30.10.1893, thus :—
   Agar cultivations of the typhoid bacillus and of the B. eoli com
munis, each twenty-seven days old and grown at 18—20° 0., were
employed :—
    Twenty needle-loops of the typhoid growth were thoroughly shaken
      up with 25 c.c. of sterilised Water.
    Ten needle-loops   of the growth of the B. coli communis were
      similarly shaken up with another 25 c.c. of sterilised water.
  The peaty water was infected with the typhoid bacillus by adding
3 c.c. of the above water attenuation to 300 c.c. of the sterilised peaty
water, whilst for infection with the B. coli communis only      0.0. of the      l
water attenuation was added to 300 c.c. of the sterilised peaty water.
The infected waters were placed in <U+FB02>asks plugged with cotton wool,
and preserved in a dark cupboard at 10—12° C.
   The fate of the bacilli (typhoid and coli) in this infected peaty
water was then ascertained by means of periodical plate cultivations,
which yielded the following results :—

      Thus even in this water, heavily charged as it was with vegetable
organic matter, the typhoid bacilli failed to undergo any multiplication,
 but, on the contrary, as usual, suffered a continuous numerical decline.
 The B. coli communis, on the other hand, remained practically unaltered
in numbers during         the period of upwards of three ueeks over which these
observations extended, the slight numerical increase being too insigni<U+FB01>cant
to be regarded as evidence of true multiplication.
     In the peaty water which had been sterilised by <U+FB01>ltration through
porous porcelain there was again the same phenomenon, so frequently
referred to before in this Report, of the extraordinarily rapid disappear
ance of the introduced typhoid and coli bacilli.

    Some previous observers,   on the other hand, record the multiplica—
tion   of the typhoid bacillus in potable waters with which they have
made      similar experiments; whilst others, again, have found no
multiplication.     It appears to me highly probable that in most, if
not in all, cases in which multiplication has been observed, it has
been occasioned through the introduction of an appreciable amount
of food-material along with the typhoid bacilli; for, as already
pointed out, most investigators have exercised very little care in
respect of this highly important factor.
    But although the typhoid bacilli taken directly from an ordinary
cultivation and plunged into potable water may not be able to pro
liferate in the latter, it appeared to me quite possible that if the
environment of the typhoid bacilli were gradually, instead of sud
denly, changed, the requirements of the bacilli might perhaps be
thereby so far modi<U+FB01>ed as to undergo multiplication in the aqueous
medium. For by gradually changing the surroundings, it would be
anticipated that those individuals most capable of <U+FB02>ourishing under
the altered conditions would be propagated, and that each successive
generation of typhoid bacilli would thus become more adapted to the
new medium.
    To ascertain whether this process of education could be actually
accomplished, the following experiments were made.
                Education of Typhoid Bacilli for Aquatic Life.
    A gelatine-culture of the typhoid bacillus was, in the <U+FB01>rst instance,
 inoculated into sterile broth of the ordinary strength, and kept at
 19—200 C.; turbidity ensued in twenty-four hours. From this broth
 cultivation an inoculation was made into 50 per cent. broth (broth
 mixed with its own volume of water); this also became turbid in
 twenty-four hours at 18—20° C. From the 50 per cent. broth culti
 vation an inoculation was made into 10 per cent. broth (1 volume of
 broth mixed with 9 volumes of water) ; this liquid only became visibly
 turbid in from two and a half to three days. After four successive
 generations of cultivation in this 10 per cent. broth medium had been
 carried on, the time elapsing between the inoculation and the appear
 ance of turbidity gradually diminished until, with the <U+FB01>fth generation,
 turbidity already set in in twenty-four hours. From this 10 per
 cent. broth, inoculation was then made into 1 per cent. broth
  (1 volume of broth mixed with 99 volumes of water); this became
 turbid in twenty-four hours. Continuous cultivation in this 1 per
  cent. broth medium was then carried on for a period of two months,
  after which it was employed for infecting _steam-sterilised Thames
  water, thus :—
     On 31.1.1894, 2 drops of a 1 per cent. broth cultivation (three

on several subsequent occasions, submitted to plate cultivation with

   These   <U+FB01>gures show that unquestionable, although not very exten
sive, multiplication     of the typhoid bacilli took place in the water
thus infected; but in order to ascertain whether this proliferation
was e<U+FB01>ected at the expense of the very small quantity of culture
material necessarily introduced along with the bacilli, or at the ex
pense of the organic matter pertaining to the Thames water itself,
the following further experiment was made :—
   On 23.2.1894, 10 c.c. of the above-infected water, which on that
day contained 5795 typhoid bacilli per 1 c.c., were added to 20 c.c.
steam-sterilised Thames water, and the latter was then and several
times subsequently submitted to plate cultivation with the follow
ing results :—
                                          Number of days
       Dates on which plates                plates were          Number of typhoid bacilli
          were prepared.                    incubated.               in 1 c.c. of water.
             23.2.1894        ......             7      ......           1830
             26.2.1894        ......             7      ......           1842
               2.3.1894       ......             6      ......            375
               6.3.1894       ......             6      ......            268
   From these <U+FB01>gures it is equally evident that in this case no multi
plication but only numerical decline of the typhoid bacilli took place.
If, however, the typhoid bacilli can proliferate at the expense of the
organic matter belonging to the Thames water, they should have
multiplied in the above experiment, as they were imported into a
quantity of water, the organic matter of which had not since sterili
sation been exposed to bacterial life; but from the fact that they did
not multiply, but, on the contrary, only tell 011 in numbers, it becomes
almost certain that the distinct multiplication observed in the former
experiment was effected at the expense of the small quantity of food
material originally introduced into the water along with the typhoid
                                                                        ‘

   Another experiment was made on similar lines to the <U+FB01>rst half of
the above experiment, to see whether the multiplication there observed
could be con<U+FB01>rmed, thus :—
    On 27.3.1894, 4 c.c. of a1 per cent. broth cultivation (three
days old) of the typhoid bacillus were put into 50 c.c. of steam
sterilised Thames water, the mixture being violently shaken up for
<U+FB01>fteen minutes; 2 c.c. of this mixture (equivalent to E17 c.c. of the
original 1 per cent. broth culture) were then added to 200 c.c. of
steam-sterilised Thames water, which was then submitted to plate
cultivation as follows :—
                                     Number of days
       Dates on which plates           plates were             N umber of typhoid bacilli
           were prepared.              incubated.                   in  l c.c. of water.
              27.3.1894:      ......        6        . . . .. . .         37,515
              29.3.1894:      ......        6        ......               61,566
              31.3.1894!      ......        9        ......               50,935
                4.4.1894:     ......        6        ......               27,818
              11.4.1894       ......        8        ......               20,130
   In this case again, therefore, there was a small but distinct multi
plication.
   From these experiments it appears that typhoid bacilli which have
undergone a prolonged and gradual training in more and more aqueous
culture-media       do ewhibit distinctly more vitality in potable water than
bacilli which are at once transferred into water from highly nutritive
solid media like agar 0r peptone jelly.         On the other hand, there is con
siderable reason for believing that the slight but distinct multiplication
which these trained bacilli undergo in potable water, is a<U+FB01>ected at the
expense of small quantities of food-material introduced along with them
at the   time of infection, and     not at the     expense        of   the organic matter
belonging to the water itself.
   The result of the experiments with these specially-trained typhoid
bacilli greatly forti<U+FB01>es the opinion which         I  have expressed above, that
the extensive multiplication of typhoid bacilli in potable waters which
has been observed by some investigators was most probably due to
the importation of appreciable quantities of food-material along with
the   bacilli  themselves.

is divisible into the following sections :—
   1.  A   series    of experiments in which the vitality of one and the
         same culture of the typhoid bacillus was observed in one and
         the same sample of Thames water, using the latter under
         the following conditions :—

  6.  In order    to compare the relative longevity of the typhoid bacillus
        in the    more important types of potable water, a long series of
        experiments was carried out in which typhoid bacilli from one
        and the same cultivation, and        in as far as possible equal num
        bers, were introduced into Thames water, Loch           Katrine water,
        and the deep well water of the Kent Company respectively.

  9.  Experiments made to ascertain whether the typhoid bacillus
        and the Bacillus coli communis, multiply in potable water which
        is very highly charged with vegetable matter (peaty, upland,

   For   the detailed conclusions arrived     at from the results of these
several series of experiments, the reader is referred to the summaries
which are appended to the descriptions of each series of experiments,
as indicated above, whilst the general conclusions which arise out of
the entire investigation may be summarised as follows :—
                            Summary of Conclusions.
   1. Typhoid     bacilli from ordinary agar-agar- and gelatine-cultures
on being introduced into steam-sterilised potable water in such num
bers as not to materially alter the composition of the latter undergo
no multiplication.       This result was uniformly obtained irrespectiver
of whether surface water like that of the Thames, which has received
the drainage of manured land, or upland surface water like that of
Loch Katrine, the organic matter in which is very similar in absolute

 amount to that in Thames water, but almost exclusively derived _from
Vegetable sources (peat) ; or, again, other upland surface water much
 more highly impregnated with peaty matter; or, lastly, deep well
water containing the merest traces of organic matter, was employed.
    In all cases, of course, special precautions were taken to prevent,
as far as possible, the importation of culture-material along with the
bacilli.
    2. By <U+FB01>rst submitting the typhoid bacilli to prolonged culture in
more and more aqueous media, and then introducing them into
steam-sterilised Thames water, slight but distinct multiplication of
the typhoid bacilli was observed, and, although, perhaps, by this
method of training the typhoid bacilli had become more adapted to
aquatic life, it appears probable that the multiplication observed took
place at the expense of the minute quantity of culture-material neces
sarily introduced with them ; for on transferring some of this infected
water in which multiplication had taken place to a larger volume of
the same steam-sterilised Thames water, no further multiplication
was found to occur, showing that the organic matter belonging to the
steam-sterilised Thames water itself was not capable of ministering to
the growth and proliferation even of these specially educated typhoid
bacilli.
   3. Although no instance of multiplication of the introduced typhoid
bacilli in these steam-sterilised potable waters was observed, on the
other hand the bacilli were found to he possessed of very considerable
longevity in them, thus :—

    In  no case was the         duration of vitality avery limited one; its
exact length in any         particular water is doubtless dependent on the
initial vitality of the bacilli and the numbers in which they are
introduced.       In the strictly comparative experiment on steam
sterilised Thames, Loch Katrine, and deep well water, it is seen that
the longevity of the typhoid bacillus is distinctly greatest in the Loch

Katrine, and least in the deep well water, and intermediate between
the two in Thames water. Of these three waters, also, the Loch
Katrine contains the most, the deep well the least, and the Thames
an intermediate amount of organic matter. Not improbably these
circumstances are connected together.
   4!.The experiments distinctly show that in these steam-sterilised
potable waters a summer temperature of 19° C. is more prejudicial
than a winter temperature of 6—8° C. to the duration of life of the
typhoid bacillus.
  5.  Inasmuch as the numerical estimation of typhoid bacilli in
unsterile potable waters       practically impossible, the duration of
                                     is
life of the typhoid bacilli in such waters has alone been made the
subject of study. This enquiry has involved an enormous amount of
labour, as the certain detection, by means of the special methods em
ployed, of the typhoid bacillus, even in a single specimen of water,
may entail work extending over several weeks.       The duration of life
of the typhoid bacilli introduced into the various unsterile waters in
the several series of experiments was as follows :—

   On comparing this table with that given under N o.      above,    will    3         it
be seen that  in all cases, excepting one, the duration   of life of the
typhoid bacillus was greater, and often nmch greater, in the steam
sterilised than in the corresponding waters unsterilised.    The single
exception to this general rule was in the case of the deep well water
in which the typhoid bacilli lived about the same length of time,
irrespectively of whether the water was sterile or not.
   The table also shows that, as in the case of the steam-sterilised
waters, the exact length of time that the typhoid bacilli endured
residence in one and the same type of unsterilised water was subject

to great variations in the different experiments, doubtless largely in
consequence of the diiferent initial vitality of the typhoid bacilli em
ployed,_and also, doubtless, in consequence of the di<U+FB01>erent numbers
in which they were introduced in the several series of experiments.
   Of principal interest is the comparative experiment made with
Thames, Loch Katrine, and deep well water, in which typhoid bacilli
from one and the same source, and in the same numbers, were intro
duced into these three types of water, and in which the duration of
life was found to be shortest in the Thames water (9—13 days),
longest in the deep well water (33—39 days), and intermediate in
the Loch Katrine water (19—33 days).           This result is of very great
practical importance as indicating the greater danger of typhoid
bacilli gaining access to deep well than to surface water. This
danger is, in actual practice, further enhanced by the fact that well
water is almost invariably consumed without storage, whilst surface
waters are often stored for days or weeks, and in the case of upland
surface water the storage frequently extends over many months.
   The effect of temperature on the duration of life of the typhoid
bacillus was well illustrated in the series of experiments with Loch
Katrine water (4.7.1893), in which it‘was found that at 19° C. the
typhoid bacilli had already disappeared in 4! to 11 days, whilst
at 6—8° C. they were alive for upwards of 17 days in the same
water.
   The effect of agitation or rest on the typhoid bacilli in these waters
was not very pronounced, but the evidence on the whole, both in the
case of the sterilised and unsterilised waters, goes to show that the
agitation or aération of the water is unfavourable to the typhoid
bacilli, and that in the unsterilised waters it occasions a more rapid
multiplication of the water bacteria.
   6. The greater bactericidal power of unsterilised than steam-steri
lised surface waters is not apparently due to the multiplication of the
water bacteria in the unsterile waters, bringing about a competition
or “ struggle for existence ” between these aquatic forms and the
typhoid bacilli, but rather to the elaboration of products by these
aquatic bacteria (and very possibly also by other vegetable life
present in surface waters) which are inimical and prejudicial to the
welfare of the typhoid bacilli.                              '
   Thus, in the typhoid-infected unsterilised deep well water an enor
mously greater multiplication of the common water bacteria took
place than in the unsterile Thames and Loch Katrine waters; yet,
notwithstanding the typhoid bacilli not only lived much longer in
this unsterile deep well water than in the unsterile Thames and Loch
Katrine waters, but there was practically no difference between the
duration of life of“ the typhoid bacilli in the sterile and unsterile deep
well water respectively.

                     Rpm-I. On  the  Bacteriology     of ll’hter.             547
      Of  course  it may be urged that the unsterile deep well water
   possibly  does not contain those water bacteria which are particularly
   <U+FB01>tted for entering into successful competition with the typhoid bacilli,
   and that perhaps such water bacteria are only to be found in the
   unsterile surface waters.                         4
      7. The series of experiments summarised in the following table
   show that unsterile surface water. like that of the Thames, possesses
   bactericidal powers irrespectively of any further multiplication of its
   contained water bacteria, thus :—                                             _
     Uninfected unsterilised Thames water, kept at 9—l2° (1., exhibited
  but little change in the number of its contained bacteria over the
  period of <U+FB01>ve weeks from 16.1.1894 to 24.2.1894.                (The numbers
  only varied from 5500—2825 per 1 c.c.)
     The same unsterilised Thames water, infected with about 170,000
  typhoid bacilli per 1 c.c., exhibited a continuous decline in the total
  number of bacteria present in it over the same period.
     The same Thames water, after sterilisation by steam, was infected
  with upwards of 100,000 typhoid bacilli per 1 c.c., and at the end of
  the same period (16.1.1894—24.2.1894) there were still upwards of
  5000 typhoid bacilli per 1 c.c. present.             .
     The same'typhoid-infected steam-sterilised water was inoculated
  with a few drops of unsterile Thames water to'communicate to it the
  Thames-water bacteria, and the latter underwent very extensive
  multiplication in this water.v      Notwithstanding, the typhoid bacilli
  lived between thirty-four and forty-one days in this water, whilst in
 the unsterile Thames water, in which no multiplication of the water
  bacteria took place, they only lived between twenty and twenty-seven
 days.
     This shorter duration of life of         the typhoid    bacilli in naturally
 unsterile Thames water than in that rendered unsterile by inoculation
 I attribute to the circumstance that in the naturally unsterile Thames
 water countless generations of water bacteria must have <U+FB02>ourished
 before the water is made the subject of experiment at all, and it
 must, therefore, be more or less saturated with those bacterial
 products which are prejudicial to the vitality of the typhoid bacillus,
 and which, in fact, frequently hamper or even inhibit the further
 multiplication of the water bact'eria themselves.
     Thus it is obvious that the ‘ii'ris'terile water in question was already,
‘at the outset of the experiment, in such a condition as to prevent any
 multiplication of its own water bacteria, whilst, after it had been
 steam sterilised, the same bacteria multiplied abundantly in it.            But
 again, at the outset of the experiment the unsterile water was in such.
 a condition as to cause a comparatively rapid disappearance              of the
 introduced typhoid bacilli, whilst after steam sterilisation it only
 became again endowed with this power of destroying the typhoid
                                                                    2 o 3

bacilli when the introduced water bacteria had undergone extensive
multiplication.
   8. The addition of common salt to unsterile Thames water, in the
proportion of 0'1, 1, and 3 per cent., causes the enormous multiplica
tion of the water bacteria present, the most striking result in this
respect being obtained with the largest addition of salt.

   10. This more rapid disappearance      of the typhoid bacilli in the
unsterile Thames water to which salt was added cannot be wholly,
but only in part, attributed to the resulting multiplication of the
water bacteria, as the addition of salt in similar proportion to typhoid
infected steam-sterilised Thames water also caused an exceedingly
rapid disappearance of the typhoid bacilli, although the disappearance
 was not so rapid as in the same water to which a few drops of un
sterile Thames water had been added, and in which, therefore, a
great multiplication of the water bacteria took place, thus :—
                                                                                   Duration of life of

Spores in Potable Water,” the enquiry was mainly con<U+FB01>ned to the
deportment either of anthrax spores alone, or of such mixtures of
bacilli and spores which are found in the usual cultivations of anthrax

on arti<U+FB01>cial media.         It is, however, obviously a matter of great
importance to ascertain how anthrax bacilli, entirely free from spores,
as they are found in the tissues of animals which have succumbed to
this disease, behave when they are introduced into potable water.
There is the more urgency for this investigation, as it was pointed
out in the introduction to the Report that the experiments previously
undertaken by others in this direction have led to highly discordant
results.                 I
    The experiments which we have made on this subject were incidental
to another investigation, on which we propose reporting later on, but
as these experiments should have been made in connection with the
2nd Report, had time and opportunity permitted, we are bringing
them forward now to <U+FB01>ll up without further delay the hiatus in that
Report.
                          First  Series of Ewperiments.
    The spleen of a white mouse, dead of anthrax, was excised under
the usual aseptic precautions, and transferred to a small sterile bottle
containing 20 c.c. of sterilised tap water, in which it was completely
broken up by bruising with a sterile glass rod. More sterile water
about 50 c.c. in all, was added to the bottle, and the whole violently
shaken for <U+FB01>fteen minutes, so as to ensure even distribution of the
bacilli throughout the water.          10 c.c. of this water attenuation were
then added to about 400 c.c. of steam-sterilised Dundee water and
thoroughly mixed, after which this infected water was distributed
 amongst a number of sterile tubes plugged with cotton wool.               This
 infected water was submitted to plate cultivation on the same day,

   These tubes were again examined on two subsequent occasions and
again yielded sterile plates.
   Thus these anthrax bacilli, taken directly from the (lead mouse and
introduced into sterile Dundee water in such large numbers as 9000 per
1 c.c. of water, all died within <U+FB01>re days, the water being kept at 12° C.
                                Second Series of Experiments.
   In this series of experiments the anthrax bacilli from the dead
animal were introduced both into steam-sterilised Thames and steam
sterilised Dundee water respectively, and these waters were preserved
at di<U+FB01>erent temperatures, in order to ascertain the in<U+FB02>uence of this
factor on the result.
   The spleen of a white mouse, which had died of anthrax twenty
eight hours after inoculation, was broken up with sterilised tap water
in the same way as already described above, and with this water
attenuation larger volumes of sterile Thames and Dundee waters
respectively were infected, and these infected waters were then dis
tributed amongst a number of sterile tubes plugged with cotton wool.
On the day of infection some of these tubes were submitted to plate
cultivation, in order to ascertain the number of anthrax bacilli

    Thus at    the temperature    of 19° 0., the behaviour  of the anthrax  bacilli
in   these   same   waters  was entirely diferent; far from their undergoing
rapid diminution in       numbers followed by early disappearance, they only
exhibited slight diminution during the <U+FB01>rst few days after their introduc
tion, upon which there followed an enormous multiplication.                   This
multiplication was already observable,          in the  case of  one  tube, on the
second day after infection, whilst on the <U+FB01>fth day it was very pronounced
in all the tubes, and on the fourteenth day the numbers reached were very
large, remaining practically unaltered even on the forty-second day.
    The explanation which naturally suggests itself for this entirely
different behaviour of the anthrax bacilli at the higher and the lower
 temperature respectively, is that at the higher temperature of 19° C.
 the anthrax bacilli can form spores, whilst at the lower temperatures
 this sporulation cannot take place.             With the appearance of the
 spores,    however,    the  longevity    of  anthrax  in sterile potable water
 becomes, as      was  shown   in  the  Second  Report, practically inde<U+FB01>nite.
    In order to test the validity of this hypothesis that sporulation had
 taken place in the waters kept at 19° 0., the following experiments
 were made :—
    (1.)   1 c.c.  of the contents of Tube 11 (Thames water, see table
              above) was kept at 70° C. for ten minutes, in order to
              destroy anthrax bacilli; on subsequent plate cultivation,
              innumerable anthrax colonies were obtained.
    (2.)   A    similar experiment made with 1 c.c. of the contents of
              Tube 12 (Thames water, see table above) gave exactly the
              same result.
    (3.) A similar experiment made with 1 c.c. of the contents of
              Tube 5 (Dundee water, see table above) gave the same
              result, innumerable anthrax colonies being obtained on the
              plate.
    (4.) A similar experiment made with l c.c. of the contents of
              Tube 6 (D undee water, see table above) gave 23,352 anthrax
              colonies.
    Thus in the case of all these waters kept at 19° C., it is evident
 that practically the whole of the anthrax microbes present at the end
  of forty-two days were there in the condition of spores, showing as
 they did no appreciable diminution in numbers by the process of
  heating to 70° C. for ten minutes.
    These experiments show, then, very clearly that the fate of virulent
 anthrax bacilli passing from an anthrax victim into potable water
 will be dependent on the temperature of the latter; if the tempera
 ture of the water is below that at which sporulation of anthrax can
 take ,place, then the bacilli will perish in the course of a few days;
  whilst if the temperature is high enough to admit of sporulation,

 556             Report on the Bacteriology  of Water.
then anthrax spores will be formed, and these, as is now well known,
may persist in a living and virulent condition for an almost inde<U+FB01>nite
period of time—for months and probably even for years.
   From these experiments it further appears that the lowest tem
perature at which spore formation of anthrax in water will take
place lies somewhere between 15° and 19° C. According to Koch,
the lowest temperature at which anthrax spores are obtained is 16° (3.,
and the most advantageous     temperature for the production of the
hardiest spores is 20—25° C.

Report of Magnetical Observations at Falmouth Observatory
       for the Year 1893. Latitude 50° 9’ O" N. and Longitude
       5° 4’ 35" W. ; height, 167 feet above mean sea—level)“
    These observations have been made by instruments purchased from
the Government Grant Fund administered by the Royal Society.
    The Observatory having been comparatively recently established,
the Vertical Force self-recording instrument is not yet in thorough
working order. It is hoped in future to publish complete records of
all three elements.
   Photographic curves of Magnetic Declination and of Horizontal
Force variations have been taken regularly throughout the past year,
and the magnets have worked satisfactorily.
   The scale values of the instruments were determined in April last.
The following values of the ordinates of the photographic curves
were then found :—
      Dcclination, 1 cm. =         0° 11"7.
      Bi<U+FB01>lar, April 7th, for       1 cm.  8 H., = 000055 C.G.S. unit.
    This latter value not being in accordance with the prescribed
standard scale, the sensibility of the magnet was increased: and a
second series of de<U+FB02>ections made on April 10th, when the value was
determined for 1 cm. 8 H. = 000050 C.G.S. unit.
   No violent magnetic disturbances have been recorded during the
year; the principal movements occurred on the following dates :—
February 5, March 26, July 16, August 6, 7, 18, and November 1, 2.
   Observations with the Absolute Instruments have been made
                                                                                   ‘

                    ,,           absolute Declination, 33.
   The results in the following tables, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, are deduced
from the magnetograph curves which have been standardised by
observations of de<U+FB02>ection and vibration.                These were made with
the Collimator Magnet marked 66A, and the Declinometer Magnet
marked 660 in the Uni<U+FB01>lar Magnetometer by Elliott Brothers, of
London.        Table No. 5 is deduced from these observations.
   * The records of the Falmouth Magnetic Observatory have hitherto been
published   in the ‘Journal of the Royal Ccrnwull Polytechnic Society.’          The
committee of management having obtained leave to communicate their annual
magnetic report to the Royal Society, it will henceforward         be printed in the
‘Proceedings.’   The results are worked up in the same way as those obtained at Kew,
and the reports of the two observatories will in future appear simultaneously.—-R.

562               Report  of Magnetieal     Observations  at
   The Inclination was observed with the Inclinometer No. 86 by
Dover, of Charlton, Kent, and needles 1 and 2, which are             inches
in length, the results of which appear in Table VI.
   The Declination and Horizontal Force values given in Tables          I to
IV are prepared in accordance with the suggestions made in the
<U+FB01>fth report of the Committee of the British Association on com—
paring and reducing magnetic observations, and the time given is
Greenwich mean time, which is 20 min. 18 sec. earlier than local time.
   The following is a list of the days during the year 1893 which
were selected by the Astronomer Royal, as suitable for the deter
mination of the'magnetic diurnal variations, and which have been
employed in'the preparation of the magnetic tables :—

                December   ..........      7, 13, 18, 21, 22.
   The following are the principal results of the magnetic elements
for the year 1893 :—
        Mean Westerly Declination, 19° 6"4.
        Mean Inclination,               67° 5"3.
        Mean Horizontal Force,          0'18455 C.G.S. unit.
   The Declination and Horizontal Force are deduced from hourly
readings of the photographic curves, and so are corrected for the
diurnal variation.
    The Inclination is the mean of the absolute observations, the mean
time of which is noon.
   In Table V, X is the mean of the absolute values observed during
the month (generally three in number), uncorrected for diurnal
variations and for any disturbance. Y is the mean of the products of
the tangents of the Dips and the corresponding values of X.
   The whole of the instruments have been maintained in good order.
 The Magnetic Chamber has been kept in a satisfactory state of
 dryness, and the Magnetic Hut in the garden has been newly roofed
 during the year.

       OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
    FREDERICK     Le Gaos    CLARK, F.R.S., F.R.C.S.Eng., who died on
 the 19th   July,  1892, after a brief illness, at the ripe age of 81, was
 born on the      7th February, 1811, in Mincing Lane, the youngest of
 nine children of a city merchant. His early years were spent in the
 city. In 1822 he went to reside as a pupil with the Rev. Ford
 Richardson, at Iron Acton, in Gloucestershire, where he remained
 four years.     Here he receiVed a very excellent education. He had
 always expressed a desire to become a Surgeon; but his father, before
 deciding, consulted his friend, Mr. Benjamin Travers, then the dis
tinguished Senior Surgeon to St. Thomas’s Hospital, who allowed the
 son to have the run of the hospital for a couple of months, at the
 end of which time his father gave him the choice of entering his own
 counting house or of being apprenticed to Mr. Travers. In February,
 1827, at the age of 16, he was apprenticed, and at once began his
 hospital career.    He appears to have been an industrious and dis
 tinguished pupil, for in 1830 he obtained the Cheselden Medal, and in
 the same year was appointed Assistant Demonstrator of Anatomy,
 under Mr. Tyrrell. He spent the summer session of this year in
 Dublin.     In 1833 he passed his examination at the Royal College of
 Surgeons. The summer session of that year he spent in Paris, that
 of 1834 in Edinburgh, that of 1835 in Berlin; and in 1836 he passed
 three months at Gottingen.       In 1837 he took rooms near the hospital
 and started in practice.     He continued working at the hospital, and
 teaching anatomy; and in 1842, when the Hospital Medical School
 was remodelled, he was elected Lecturer on Descriptive and Surgical
 Anatomy; and in 18453, on Mr. Tyrrell’s death, he was appointed
 Assistant Surgeon. He then removed to Finsbury Square. In 18417
 he was elected Surgical Secretary to the Medico-Chirurgical Society,
 and in the following year moved to Spring Gardens. In 1853 he was
 appointed full Surgeon to the hospital; and increasing engagements
 compelled him to retire from the Chair of Anatomy in 1854, though
 still retaining the lectures on Regional and Surgical Anatomy. In
 1858 he removed to St. Thomas’s Street, at the request of the
 Governors, and in 1860 became Lecturer on Surgery, an appoint
 ment which he held down to his retirement from the hospital. In
 1864 he was appointed Examiner in Surgery to the Royal College of
                                                                   b

 Physicians for two years; and in July of the same year was elected a
 Member of the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons, and was at
 the head of the poll. In 1866 he was appointed Examiner in Surgery
 to the University of London for a period of <U+FB01>ve years; in 1867
 Professor of Human Anatomy and Surgery to the College of Sur
 geons; in 1868 Hunterian Professor of Surgery and Pathology; and
 Examiner at the College in 1870. In 1872 he was appointed Vice
 President of the College, and in 1875 President, giving the Hunterian
 Oration on the 13th February, 1875, the forty-eighth anniversary of
 his apprenticeship to the college.    In 1872 he was elected a Fellow
 of the Royal Society. In 1873 he retired from the hospital, having
retained of<U+FB01>ce for a year or two at the special request of the Gover
nors.    In 1877 he gave up practice, and took up his residence per
manently at Sevenoaks; and in 1879 he retired from the Council of
the Royal College of Surgeons.       But even after his retirement he
remained a busy and active man.          He still continued Consulting
Surgeon to the South Eastern Railway Company; he was always
ready to give professional assistance to his neighbours; he was
 Consulting Surgeon to and an active Governor of the Hospital with
which he had been so long connected, took great interest in the
 welfare and progress of the Medical School, attended all anniversary
and other important or interesting meetings, taking part in their
proceedings; and he retained his connexion with the Salters Com
pany, of which he had been twice master, at twenty years’ interval.
 It should be added, that in addition to other duties he was for some
years Surgeon to the Magdalen Hospital and to the London Female
 Penitentiary, and Consulting Surgeon to the Surrey County and
 Great Northern Hospitals.
    Mr. Le Gros Clark was in many respects a remarkable man. In
 the’<U+FB01>rst place he had striking physical endowments; he was tall and
 well made, spare but very muscular, singularly handsome, with dark
 curly hair and whiskers, dark grey eyes and bushy eyebrows, and well
 formed features; and was remarkably digni<U+FB01>ed and gentlemanly in
 appearance and demeanonr.      As a young man he was a great athlete,
 excelling especially in rowing, boxing, and riding, and he retained
 this activity of body to the last. He was hardly what one would
term a genial man; but he was a man of the highest character, he
 was absolutely unsel<U+FB01>sh and unself seeking; whatever he undertook
 to do he did with all his might, be was perfectly truthful and trust
 worthy, and always kind and considerate for others, and a warm and
 appreciative friend. He was a devout Christian, and member of the
 Church of England. As a surgeon and a teacher he was excellent.
 He was a thorough anatomist, and an admirable lecturer on anatomy.
 He had had a wide experience as a surgeon, and was admirably well
 up in the subject; he was conscientiously attentive to his patients,

and neglected nothing for their bene<U+FB01>t, and he was a faultless operator.
As a clinical teacher he was admirable. He was not, and did not aim at
being, a speaker of commanding eloquence ; nevertheless he was a most
excellent and ready lecturer and speaker.           His manner was always
quiet and gentlemanly; his language was always simple and well
chosen; and his matter was always appropriate to the occasion. He was
consequently not only a clear and attractive lecturer, but he was a clear
and attractive speaker on all festive and other occasions.          Although
he was a scienti<U+FB01>c surgeon and anatomist he did not do much original
scienti<U+FB01>c work.        He wrote many papers on points in anatomy and
surgery that interested him; he lectured (as before stated) at the
Royal College of Surgeons. He delivered three introductory addresses
at St. Thomas’s Hospital. While president he delivered the Hunterian
Oration at the College of Surgeons, an address which was philosophical
and full of thought.        He contributed a paper on ‘The Mechanism of
               ’                                                  ’
Respiration        to the ‘ Proceedings of the Royal Society         (vol. 20,
1872).     In 1836    he published  a work  on the anatomy and physiology of
the nervous system; in 1847 and 1853 he translated two volumes of
                 ‘                ’
Dupuytren’s Lecons Orales for the Sydenham Society ; he published
‘Lectures on Surgical Diagnosis of Visceral Lesions ’ in 1870; and

critical articles in the ‘British and Foreign Quarterly,’ and he made
a few contributions of cases t0(the medical papers.          Lastly, he pub
