    In  accordance with the Statutes, notice of the ensuing Anniversary Meet
 ing  for  the election of Council and O<U+FB02>ieers was given from the Chair.
    The following communication was read :—
 1.  “Description of         an  Apparatus for the Veri<U+FB01>cation of Sextants
        designed      and constructed by Mr. T. Cooke, and recently erected
        at   the     ch    Observatory.”     By BALFOUR. STEWART, LL.D.,
        Superintendent        of  the  Kew Observatory.       Received   May 9,
        1867.
    In order to test the accuracy of graduation of a sextant, it is necessary
 to have a series of well-de<U+FB01>ned objects, the angular distances between
 which must be accurately known. The sextant under trial is made to
 measure these angular distances; and the results thus obtained, when
 compared with the correct values of these distances (supposed to be
 otherwise determined), will give at once the error of the instrument.
    Now with regard to this series of objects, the following conditions are
necessary in order that they may be convenient for the purpose of testing
 sextants :—
       a.   It   is necessary that the objects should be distinctly seen and
              well de<U+FB01>ned.      Luminous objects would be preferable, if these
              could be obtained.      Luminous points would answer well.
       B.   It  is  necessary  that they should be at a very great, or virtually
              in<U+FB01>nite distance from the sextant, so that two lines proceed
              ing from any point in the objects, the one to the index-glass,
              and the other to the horizon-glass, should be virtually parallel
              to each other.
       1.   It   is necessary that these objects should be at such angular
               distances from one another, that by means of them it may be
              possible to test, say every 15° of a sextant’s are.
       3. It is necessary that these objects should be always visible, or at
              least that they should be rendered visible easily, and without
              loss of time.
    A  series    of  <U+FB01>xed stars, at suitable intervals from one another, might
be made to ful<U+FB01>l the <U+FB01>rst three of these conditions         ; but in this uncer
tain climate it would be inconvenient to adopt any mode of veri<U+FB01>cation
depending for its success upon the visibility of the sun or stars ;—in <U+FB01>ne
we must have a source of light which can always he commanded.
    A plan proposed by Mr. T. Cooke ful<U+FB01>ls this requirement, and as it
has now been carried out with apparent success, a short description of
it may perhaps be acceptable to the Royal Society.
    His arrangement is of the following nature :—
    F, G denote two collimators, F having a single vertical line, and G a
couple of cross lines, as shown in the <U+FB01>gure.

1867.]                for   the Veri<U+FB01>cation     of Sewtants.                           3
  The collimator F is at the principal focus of the lens a, and the colli
mator G at that of the lens 6.
      Elevation of Collimators,  showing wires viewed from outside the circle.
     Plan of Cooke’s Apparatus for Verifying Sextants   at the Kew Observatory.
      A. Double collimators.                D. Candles for illuminating wires.
       B. Table for holding sextants.       E. Slate to which collirriators are bolted.
       C. Sextant.                           F & G. Wires in collimators.
  Furthermore, the lenses are so adjusted that the two lines, the one of
which is that proceeding from the centre of the collimator F to the
centre of the lens a, and the other that proceeding from the centre of
the collimator G to the centre of the lens b, shall be parallel to one
another.
   This condition is ful<U+FB01>lled in the following manner :—A telescope
having an object-glass suf<U+FB01>ciently large to embrace at once the two
collimators a and b, is focused by means of a star for an object in<U+FB01>
nitely distant.     It is then used as an instrument wherewith to view
these collimators previously illuminated; if they appear in focus, it
follows that they are to be optically regarded as in<U+FB01>nitely distant
bodies, and thus that they are accurately at the principal foci of their
respective lenses.
   1n the next place, things are so adjusted that the vertical collimator
shall appear to bisect the cross-wire collimator in the <U+FB01>eld of view of
                                                                         n 2

  41                  Dr. B. Stewart    on an    Apparatus         [June 20,
  the telescope.   This adjustment is one which, from the form of the two
  collimators (a straight line and two cross lines), can be made with great
  exactnes, and when accomplished, it follows that the two collimators,
  F and G, are to be optically regarded as two in<U+FB01>nitely distant bodies,
  both being in the same direction.
     Each of the two collimators has a moveable cover, so that, if desirable,
  the one can be viewed without the other.
     The collimator lines are illuminated in the following manner :——These
  lines are formed of <U+FB01>ne glass threads, and the light of candles symme
  trically disposed is allowed to fall upon these threads.  By this arrange—
  ment the threads are rendered luminous on both their sides at the same
  time; there is therefore no perceptible parallax, such as would follow
  from the one side of the thread being lit; up at one time, and the other at
  another time.
     It is now necessary to describe the method of <U+FB01>xing the collimators.
     A brick erection was made in the basement hall of the Observatory,
 having the shape of a circular are. To the <U+FB02>at top of this erection three
 pieces of slate, all in one horizontal plane, and having their upper sur
 faces curved, were attached by cement; <U+FB01>nally, a slate slab, E (shown
 in the <U+FB01>gure), was laid so as to rest simultaneously on these three curved
 surfaces.    The collimators, being intended to rest on this slate slab, had
 their lower surfaces made quite <U+FB02>at, and were <U+FB01>rmly bolted by means of
 screws to the slab.
     The angular distances between the collimators are (roundly speaking)
 as follows :—
                         From   1 to 2  ............  30°
                             ,, 1  ,, 3 ............  60°
                            ,,  1 ,, 41 ............ 105°
                            ,,  1 ,, 5  ............ 120°
     A horizontal table, B, capable of motion, either vertically or in
azimuth, and also capable of being rigidly <U+FB01>xed in any required posi
tion, is placed in the centre of the circle of which the boundary line of
the slate slab constitutes the circumference.
    In order to determine accurately the angular distance between the
various collimators, a theodolite is placed on the table B, so that when
levelled its telescope, as it sweeps round in azimuth, may be able to bring
into the middle of its <U+FB01>eld of view the various collimators.
    N 0 care need be taken that the centre of the theodolite is precisely in
the centre of the circle, because the collimators being virtually at an
in<U+FB01>nite distance, it follows that the angular distance between any two
of them does not depend on the exact centering of the theodolite.
    Now, if any theodolite be taken, and if a number of sets of observa
tions of the angular distances between the collimators be made, each
not starting from a fresh point in the azimuth circle of the theodolite, it

 1867.]                      for      the Veri<U+FB01>cation             of Sealants.                                 5
is evident that by this means we shall eliminate any error of graduation
of the theodolite.
     A complete set of determinations of these angular distances ought,
therefore, to refer to at least three starting~points in the horizontal
circle of the theodolite, these being, say 120°, apart from each other.
     The following complete sets have been made at various dates by Mr.
 G. Whipple :—
ltieasurements of the Angles between the Collimators of the Apparatus
                               for the Veri<U+FB01>cation of Sextants.
   The measurements              were made with a 6-in. Theodolite, divided to 30".

     It will be seen from Table II. that the observational di<U+FB02>'erences from
the means are extremely small, and capable of being accounted for by
the uncertainty of reading a theodolite graduated to 30”. We may
therefore suppose the positions of the collimators to have remained the
  ame throughout the period embraced by our observations.

6                   Mr.  J. P. Gassiot on Observations            [June 20,
   In conclusion, it may be desirable to describe in a few words the
method by which a sextant may be veri<U+FB01>ed by means of this apparatus.
   Let us suppose the collimators to be accurately and quite immoveably
<U+FB01>xed, and the angular distances     between    them  to be accurately deter
mined.     Also let the distance between the two lenses a and b of any
collimator be such that the collimator F may be seen through a at the
horizon-glass, and the collimator G through b at the index-glass of an
ordinary sextant placed on the table B.
   In order to test the index-error of a sextant, the vertical line of a
collimator is made to bisect the cross lines belonging to the same
collimator in the <U+FB01>eld of view of the telescope of this sextant.      If the
sextant is accurate, it should read zero, since these two lines are in<U+FB01>
nitely distant and in the same direction.
   The sextant is next placed with its horizon-glass receiving the rays
from the vertical line collimator F, (G4 being covered), and its index
glass receiving the rays from the cross line collimator G,, and the tele
scope arm is moved until F, bisects G, in the <U+FB01>eld of view; if the in
strument is correct, the reading ought to be (by Table III.) 15° 0' 10”‘4r.
By pursuing this method it is evident from Table III. that the error of
graduation of the sextant may be determined at every 15° of its arc.
   In conclusion, it ought to be mentioned that perhaps no arti<U+FB01>cal light
easily obtainable is suf<U+FB01>ciently powerful to allow of the darkest glasses
of a sextant being examined, and that for this purpose we may ultimately
have to resort to other means.
II. “On      the  Observations   made    with    a Rigid  Spectroscope,   by
      Captain Mayne        and Mr.    Connor, 2nd Master of          H.M.S.
      ‘Nassau,’ on a voyage to the Straits of Magellan.”            By J. P.
      Gassror, F.R.S.      Received May 25 and June 3, 1867.
   In  a communication   I made  to the Royal Society on the 18th of May
                                          I
1865 (Proceedings, vol. xiv. page 320), described the rigid spectroscope
which, at the suggestion of Mr. Balfour Stewart (in connection with a
                                                      I
plan jointly conceived by Prof. Tait and himself), had had constructed,
the object sought being to determine by observation whether the index
of refraction does not vary with the coe<U+FB02>icient of terrestrial gravity, for
which purpose it was thought desirable that the observation should be
entrusted to some of<U+FB01>cer on board one of H.M. ships visiting various
latitudes on both sides of the equator.
   Through the kindness of Captain Richards, Hydrographer to the
Admiralty,     I obtained an introduction to Captain Mayne, of H.M.
Ship ‘Nassau,’ at that time (August 1866) <U+FB01>tting out at Woolwich,
preparatory to making a survey of the Straits of Magellan, and by
appointment with Captain Mayne         I visited the ‘Nassau’ in company
with Captain Richards.

  1867.]                made with a     Rigid Spectroscope.                             7
    After carefully examining one or two positions in which the instru
 ment could be placed, Captain Mayne selected a place in his own cabin,
 and explained to us that it was his intention to place the spectroscope
 in charge of an intelligent young of<U+FB01>cer, Mr. Connor, the 2nd Master,
 by whom the observations would be made; but as the instrument neces
 sarily remained in Captain Mayne’s cabin, the observations would be
 made generally in his presence, and under his immediate superin
 tendence.
    Captain Mayne and Mr. Connor shortly afterwards examined the
 spectroscope at the rooms of the Royal Society, in the presence of Mr.
 Stewart and myself, when they practised the mode of observing; but,
 in order to ensure the observations being subsequently made without
 any bias as to obtaining particular results, no further explanation
 was given to Captain Mayne or Mr. Connor, the latter being merely
 requested day by day to note the result of his observations, and to
 enter-the same in printed forms with which he would be supplied,
 Captain Mayne promising to forward the particulars to Captain
 Richards at his convenience.
    The form supplied was as follows :—

   Mr. Browning, who constructed the instrument, took charge of it on
the 21st of August 1866, and proceeding to Woolwich placed it on board
the ‘Nassau,’ in the position which had been arranged by Captain
Mayne.
   On the 4th inst.      I  received a letter from Captain Mayne, of which
the following is an extract :—

   “Mr     DEAR    Mn. Gassro'r,—As we are on our way to the Falkland
Isles, and  my time     will probably be fully occupied when we get there,
I write   you a  few lines to say that    I   am sending to the Hydrographer a
diagram of the observations of the spectroscope taken since we left
                     I

observations have been carefully taken, and            I   hope a discussion upon
them may throw some light upon the subject in which you and others
are so interested. Mr. Connor plotted the diagram with great care.
Usually the observations have been made by him, but                    I  have taken

with a wound which these wretched Fuegians gave him.                  You will see
the method pursued in the diagram is to give the whole voyage com
plete, and also the <U+FB02>uctuations during our stay at the various places
named.     Let me add, what       I  also said to the Hydrographer, that we
shall  be happy to carry out any changes in position of the instrument,
or mode of observation, you may wish, so far as our other duties will
permit.    I shall be very glad also to hear that our observations have
been in any way useful.        The weather we have hitherto experienced
has been rather better than we expected, but gale, gale, gale, the wind
seems never tired; if it does for a few hours forget to maintain the

   “ SIR,——I
              beg to forward the following remarks on the rigid spectro
scope which was placed on board this ship at the request of Mr. Gassiot,
V.P.R.S., with the view of determining whether the position of the D line
of the spectrum changes with the coe<U+FB02>icient of terrestrial gravity. Ac
companying the remarks is a diagram, intended to show at a glance the
<U+FB02>uctuations which have actually occurred in the line of the spectrum
during our voyage from Plymouth to the Straits of Magellan, as well
as those of the barometer and “ air
                                               ”                 ”
                                                 and “ prism        thermometers
during the same period. In addition to this it has been thought advi
sable to plot in the same way the <U+FB02>uctuations which occurred during
the ship’s stay at the various ports of call on the voyage out indepen
dently, as they cannot of course be in any way due to change of
gravitation.   They will be seen on the lower part of the diagram, the
same number of observations         having been plotted after our arrival in
the straits as Were taken at Plymouth, the two places being so nearly
in the same latitude.
   “A description of this instrument has been given by Mr. Gassiot
before the Royal Society. Its position on board being selected by Mr.
Gassiot himself, in concert with Mr. Browning, it was placed, at their
desire, on the port side of my cabin, and its position has in no way
been altered since. All the observations have been made either by Mr.
Connor or myself: Mr. Connor, in whose special charge the instru

1867.]               made  with a Rigid Spectroscope.                   9
ment was placed, having observed it by far the most frequently, and
having given considerable attention to it. The observations were made
at noon daily, and, owing to the de<U+FB01>ciency of light, have (at Mr. Brown
ing’ instance) been made by bringing the moveable micrometer wire
into the centre' of the right bright space instead of its right edge,
as  I understand was the use at Kew.
   “ The
          diagram seemed to show that the barometer affects the instru
ment, the micrometer reading increasing as the barometer falls, and
vice oer-ed.   In this regard it is curious that, from a series of twenty
observations, taken since we have been in the Straits of Magellan,
Mr. Connor deduced that the micrometer should read 3'84 when the
barometer was 30 inches and attached thermometer 54i° F., and that a
few days since, when the barometer and thermometer were as above, the
micrometer reading was 3‘86. The <U+FB02>uctuations shown when the ship
was stationary seemed to point out that at least the barometer has
very considerable effect upon the reading of the instrument: what
amount of the general changes shown may be due to change in the
coef<U+FB01>cient of terrestrial gravity   I leave to those who have made the
spectrum their study to determine.
   “ The
          barometer readings shown on the diagram have purposely not
been reduced to the mean temperature of 32° Fahr.,as it is thought they
show better what is desired than if they were so; should it be thought
advisable to reduce them it can easily be done, as the temperature of
the air-thermometer plotted hardly di<U+FB02>'ers perceptiny           from that
attached to the barometer.        The observations are still being made
daily, and the record of them kept; if any change of position, other
method of observing, or any other alteration is thought advisable by
those interested in the observations, it shall receive all the attention
the nature of the service on which we are employed will permit us to
bestow.

   “
      Captain Richards, R.1V., Hydrograpker, Admiralty.”
   As the diagrams referred to could not be conveniently engraved for
insertion in the Proceedings, they remain at the Royal Society.
   The observations of Captain Mayne and Mr. Connor have evidently
been made with great care; the diagrams executed by the latter gen
tleman exhibit at a glance the actual results.
   In these diagrams two series of observations are recorded; the <U+FB01>rst
exhibits the spectroscope reading, along with the reading of the baro
meter, of the thermometer imbedded in the glass prism, and of that
showing the temperature of the air around the instrument as the vessel
proceeded on its course.
   The second exhibits similar records, made when the vessel stopped

  10                 Mr.   J.  P. Gassiot   on Observations          [June 20,
  at various places during the voyage.          In order to make use of these
  records, it became necessary to ascertain the corrections of the instru
                                                              '
  ment.
     Immediately on receipt of Captain Mayne’s letters,            I forwarded
  them to   Mr. Stewart, to whom       I am indebted for the following obser
  vations, with the necessary corrections for temperature, &c.           These
  corrections are,—
                        I.  The Temperature     Correction.
     In order  to determine      the correction, very complete sets of experi
 ments were made by Mr. Balfour          Stewart at Kew Observatory, and by
 Mr. Browning at the Minories.
     In January   1866 the spectroscope was conveyed to Kew Observa
 tory,  and  was  there   exposed to a change of temperature equal to 30°
 Fahr.     The change was applied very gradually, the experiments for one
 set lasting nearly one month ; in respect to duration these changes
 were consequently analogous to those to which the instrument would
 be exposed at sea, but, on the other hand, the instrument, when at
 Kew,    was not subjected to vibrations.
     In  February 1865 the spectroscope        had   been subjected to similar
 changes   of temperature     at   Mr. Browning’s    house of business in the
 Minories, which abuts on the Blackwall railway.            The results there
 obtained are recorded in the Proceedings of the Royal Society (vol. xiv.
 June 1865). These observations extend over arange of 30° Fahr.; and
as in the greater portion of the time during the observations the in
strument was subject to constant vibration from the ordinary work
carried on in the work-rooms, as well as from the abutting railroad,
these constant vibrations were so far analogous to the action to which
the instrument would be subjected to on board a vessel.
    On the other hand, the heating and cooling each took place on the
same day, and as far therefore as duration is concerned, the tempera
ture changes at the Minories were dissimilar to those to which the
instrument was exposed at sea.
    The result of these experiments was that, for an increase of tem
perature of 30° Fahr., there was observed an increase in the reading of
I32 revolution of the micrometer screw.
    The following Table exhibits the result of the observations made at
Kew Observatory :—

    If we     compare (2) with the mean of (1) and (3), and (4) with the
 mean    of  (3) and (5), we obtain as the Kew correction for temperature
 an increase of 1'44 revolution for an increase of 30° Fahr.

    These two results are therefore extremely consistent with each other,
 although the treatment to which the instrument was exposed differed
 materially in the two cases. We should therefore say that the tempera
 ture correction should not vary with change of treatment, and have
 therefore considerable con<U+FB01>dence in applying the above value of it to
 observations made on board the ‘ Nassau.’
               II.   Correction   for     Change    of Atmospheric Pressure.
    It  is justly remarked by Captain Mayne that the readings seemed to
 vary with the barometer.

12                   Mr. J. P. Gassiot on Observations                 [June 20,
    This correction   is,  however, small; and as the change of mean baro
 metric pressure between the di<U+FB01>'erent latitudes         is small alo, the cor
 rection will not affect the range, but   it   will affect the comparability of
 individual observations, and ought therefore to be determined.              This
is  best done by means of the observations themselves after the tem
 perature corrections have been applied.
    Thus we <U+FB01>nd that, when the ship was stationary at Plymouth, there
 were considerable <U+FB02>uctuations of the barometer, and from the obser
vations made there,   it    appears that a rise of half an inch creates a fall
in the reading =0'18. Similar <U+FB02>uctuations took place while the ship
was stationary at Magellan, and from these we obtain            fall of 0'24: for
                                                                   a
every   rise  of half an inch.
   The mean of the two, or      a   fall of 0‘21 in the reading for    a  rise of
half an inch, may safely be adopted.
   N correction has been applied for the hygrometric state of the air.

M. Jamin has found that aqueous vapour, at the temperature of 0°
Cent., and under the pressure of 0'76 metre, would have for its index of
refraction (if  it could exist under such  a   pressure) the value of 1000261,
which       less than that of air, which
           is                             is  1000294; the superior quantity
of aqueous vapour would thus tend to diminish the index of refraction
of air at the equator, as compared with that of the same pressure at
higher latitudes.
                                                     ‘
   This action of vapour, which      is very small, will be such that without
it the residual range (which will be afterwards exhibited) would appear
to be somewhat larger than      it   at present appears;      cannot therefore

account for the residual range, and may be in the meantime neg

     we now tabulate from the diagram sent by Captain Mayne, and
if,by means of the above-named corrections, we reduce all observations
to 60° Fahr. and to 30 inches barometric pressure, we obtain the fol
lowing readings for the various latitudes between 45° N. and 45° 8.,

  Nata—Since the barometer correction        small, and the range of
                                                is

    Thus, whether we take the obervations when the ship was in motion,
 or those when she was at rest, we <U+FB01>nd a very perceptible residual
 difference, the cause of which is unknown, and the tendency of which
 is to make the readings at the equator about 0‘33 revolution lower

 to mention, denotes a decrease of-refraction, as may be seen by con
 sidering the construction of the instrument, and as has been determined

    “ Mr mun Sm,—I          have read and carefully considered              your Spectro
 scope paper, and send you my remarks.
    “
      On examining Captain Mayne’s diagram, we are struck with the
 paramount in<U+FB02>uence of change of temperature.                      I   say temperature,
 without specifying whether of air or prism, for the two are nearly
 equal, so that we have not data to decide.                 It appears therefore that
 the small variation for temperature, previously known to exist, forms
 the leading variation observed; and the variation due to any other
 cause must be sought for in the residue left on eliminating this.
 Hence accuracy in the temperature-correction applied is of much
 importance.
    “ To what
                degree of accuracy then can we trust the temperature cor
rection ? To form a notion of this,          I  took“ the mean temperatures and
 mean readings for the <U+FB01>ve groups of Kew observations, and the mean
of the means. Taking the mean of the mean readings to correspond
with the mean of the mean temperatures, and applying Mr. Stewart’s
temperature-correction (Kew observations), namely, +144: reading for
                        I
 +30° temperature, calculated the reading for each of the <U+FB01>ve groups,
subtracted the results from the observed readings, and regarded the
differences as errors.       The mean error is '19; and the difference be
tween two quantities subject both to errors having a mean value of
'19 would be given to within a mean error of '27, which being for 25°
would correspond to '32 for 30°.                  No doubt the mean of several
comparisons would       come   closer    than   this,  but '20 for 30° or '13 for 20°
may be taken to be a very probable uncertainty.
   “ Mr. Stewart’s corrected numbers are plotted in
                                                                     <U+FB01>g. 2. The curve
pretty plainly     exhibits  two    features,    (1)   a general   descent,     (2) a con
cavity turned upwards.
   “ The
          general descent Mr. Stewart attributes, most probably correctly,
to a progressive change in the instrument.                On the assumption that the
progressive   change    is  uniform,     the   readings     would be represented, so

far  as this cause    of variation is concerned, by the ordinates of the
straight  line  (dotted), <U+FB01>g. 2; and accordingly hIr. Stewart, assuming the
uniformity of instrumental change, takes the difference of ordinates of
the dotted and curve lines (<U+FB01>g. 2) as a quantity unexplained by known
cause.     This quantity follows very well the march of the latitude,
or of the temperature which marches with the latitude. It would be
removed by supposing the temperature-correction applied to be too
great by about
                              0-30 or 0'33 for 20°.
    “Such   an error in the temperature-correction can hardly be said to
be too great to be admitted.        Still it is greater than we should expect
if  the London and Kew determinations apply to the state of things on
board ship.
   “I   do not think     Mr. Browning’s conjecture that the progressive
change was due to an alteration in the glass of the prisms probable.
I  should think it more probably due to a slow release from a state of
constraint in which the instrument was left by the boltiugs, &c.          If so,

thence arising will be represented by the ordinate, not of a straight

curve of <U+FB01>g. 3, and the unexplained residue will be reduced to the ordi

 the temperature-correction, yet venture to differ with him regarding the
 degree of accuracy to which we can trust the temperature-correction.
      “Referring to Prof. Stokes’s numerical results,                 I  should object to
 found any theory upon the <U+FB01>rst-noted reading '71.
     “The rigid spectroscope was unfortunately brought to Kew only one
 day before the temperature experiments (instituted more particularly
 for the magnetographs) commenced, and only two readings were taken
 before the temperature was raised.                I  believed it only right to include
 these two in the account given of temperature observations, but                        I take
 this opportunity of saying that              I   do not attach much value to the
mean of these two.

mined equally well by land and by sea observation, to obtain a result
differing from the mean of (A) and (B) by a quantity something like '06.
If     temperature-correction be the same at land and at sea,                        I   think
therefore that the residual difference observed at sea cannot be attri
butable to an imperfect estimation of temperature-correction.

        Prof. Stokes next suggests that the progressive change of the instru
ment may have been greatest at the <U+FB01>rst part of the Voyage.                       Allowing
as the greatest possible extreme though very improbable case, that it
all took place before the equator, that would still leave a difference of
'09 revolution to be accounted for.
     “But this supposition cannot evidently be entertained; indeed, as the

instrument was nearly two years old when it went to sea, there is a
dif<U+FB01>culty in supposing that the correction was very much greater at
the <U+FB01>rst half than at the second half of the voyage.
   “On the whole           I
                        should be disposed to state the result in the
following manner :—
   “That the in<U+FB02>uence of the variation of gravity does not exceed, in
passing from lat. 45° to the equator, a change of refraction for the
yellow of the spectrum equal to about three-fourths of the interval                       _
of the D-lines; but more observations must be made before it can
be asserted that this apparent change is not due to known causes.

really, as they appear to do, for the following reason :—
    As it was not convenient to procure a good subject destroyed by a
violent death,       I made use of a powerful man who had died of cholera *,
and who had been a blacksmith by profession. Now, it is natural to sup
pose that the muscles of the arm of a blacksmith are more developed
than those of his leg, so that their cross section would be relatively too
great, and the coef<U+FB01>cient derived from that cross section, therefore, too
    i It is  well known that after death by Cholera, life continues in the muscles, and
manifests    itself for some hours by movements, and by the existence of the muscular
susurrus.     This latter fact, the <U+FB01>rst notice of which belongs to Dr. Collongucs, of Paris,
I  have repeatedly veri<U+FB01>ed, as also the continuance of the susurrus in cases of death by
tetanus.                                                                        I
            It appeared to me, therefore, that such a subject as selected was one well
suited to the purpose of my observations.

    The mean of the coef<U+FB01>cients found from my own measurement of the
muscles of the arm, and that of Professor Donders, is 1084 lbs., which
agrees nearly with that obtained from the muscles of the leg, viz.
110-4 lbs., and the mean of all the observations on arm and leg would
be 109'41b5,, a result which              I consider to be not far from the truth.
    The cross sections of the muscles were found by cutting them across
with a sharp scalpel, and marking out their section on cardboard, and
afterwards weighing the marked portions, the weights of which were
then compared with the weight of a known number of square inches of
the same cardboard, and so the cross sections in s 'u'aafe inches calculated.

    I  give here, for the purpose of illustration, the actual sections of the
 muscles of the leg.           (Figs. 1—6.)
    The perpendiculars let fall upon the directions of the muscles were
measured by stretching strings from the origin to the insertion of the
 muscles, and measuring, by means of a compass, the perpendiculars let
 fall upon these strings from the axis of the joint.
    The weights of the muscles themselves were as follows :—

 lead necessarily to the principle that-each tendon conveying the effect

  that the cross sections    of  any two muscles tending to produce a similar
  q<U+FB02>'cct are   directly proportional to the cross sections of their tendons.
      I shall select as an example the case of the <U+FB01>exor hallucis longus and
 <U+FB01>exor digiiorum       communis perforans of the Rhea, whose       tendons unite

      The cross sections of these two muscles are shown in the annexed
~  <U+FB01>gures, taken as in the human subject. (Figs. 7 and 8.)
      The areas of these cross sections were found to be as 245 to 160; or
  the lesser was 65 per cent. of the greater.
      Two equal lengths of the dried tendons were then weighed and found
  to be in the proportion of 845 to 495, which was assumed to be the
  proportion of their cross sections.         The lesser of these numbers is
  59 per cent. of the greater; a result that seems to be as near to the
  former result derived from the muscles, as can be expected in this class
  of experiments.
  IV.    “Observations on      the Anatomy of the Thyroid Body in Man.”
         By    GEORGE      W. CALLENDER,       Lecturer on Anatomy at St.
         Bartholomew’s      Hospital.    Communicated by Mr. Paosr, Re
         ceived   June 8, 1867.
                                      (Abstract)
      Much    doubt exists as to the earliest connexions    of the thyroid body,
  whether it is developed, that is to say, with the membranous air-tube,
   or has a common origin with the thymus gland.                There are no re
   liable observations as to the formation of the isthmus or as to the origin
  of the pyramid, so far, at least, as man is concerned, although, with
  reference to the isthmus, its absence in an entire class, that of birds,
  and the observations of Gray on the formation of the thyroid in the
  chick, countenance the supposition that it results from the growing
  together of two lateral masses.
      In a human foetus, between the seventh and eighth week, the thyroid
  body is closely connected wichthe trachea and with the lower edge of the
  larynx, and although consisting of but one piece is deeply notched, and
  thus looks as though made up of three separate lobes.               It is quite
  distinct    from  the  thymus, as may be further seen in the dissection of
   a foetal rabbit or foetal pig, in which, whilst <U+FB01>rmly attached to the
  trachea, it has no kind of connexion with the thymus.            In the human
  fmtus no distinct evidence of the thyroid appears to exist before the
  sixth week, up to which time it cannot,        I believe, be isolated from the
   structures in front of the neck. It seems to come out from the blastema
  in the form of a mass in front of the trachea, and quickly acquires an
  imperfectly lobed appearance.
      In the dissections referred to, the presence of a middle portion and its

 1867]        On the Physical Constitution of the Sun and Stars.             25
 equal development with the lateral lobes lead to the inference that this
 central part is present from the earliest period, and that the thyroid
isthmus is not formed by a growing together of two distinct sidepieces.
                                                                I
 In examining the thyroid in fwtal dogs, cats, and hares, have always
 found the middle portion equally developed with the side lobes, and
 bounded by notches which seem to de<U+FB01>ne it from them. With the growth
 of the fwtus the central part appears to <U+FB02>atten, losing the rounded,
lobular condition, and sometimes disappears.           The isthmus is formed
 from the smaller, middle, division unitingithe other two; but there may be
an absence of isthmus through failure of this union, the middle portion
joining the right or left lobe, or a small middle lobe may remain distinct
from the other two. The pyramid is very commonly met with in the
fmtus, and is clearly an outlying part of the body, sometimes represented
by bud-like projections, sometimes consisting of a process which reaches
to the hyoid hone. It is probable that these outgrowths from the foetal
thyroid often shrink and disappear with advancing years.
    The dissections of the human foetus lead to the following conclu
sionsz—(l) The thyroid is developed in connexion with the air-tube,
and has no relation with the thymus.           (2) It does not consist of two
separate    lateral masses,   and _the isthmus   is present from the <U+FB01>rst as
a distinct central portion.        (3) The  pyramid is an outlying part of
the body, presenting, during foetal life, all possible variations as to shape
and site.

                                    (Abstract)
    An attempt is made in the memoir of which this is an abstract to take
advantage of the insight we have gained within the last few years into the
molecular constitution of gases, and the laws which regulate the exchanges
of heat that take place between bodies placed in presence of one another,
and to apply these new materials to the interpretation of the phenomena of
 the photosphere of the sun, the appearances presented during total eclipses,
and the information about both sun and stars given by the spectroscope.
    In an inquiry like this, where we are obliged to put up with such proofs as
 the materials at our disposal can supply, we must be content to accept re
 sults of every variety of probability, from that degree, bordering upon cer
 tainty, which commands an unhesitating assent, to that of which the chief
 scienti<U+FB01>c value is that it prompts to further investigation and points out a
 path. Those who read the memoir itself will best judge of the probability
 of each conclusion from the proofs laid before them ; but in this sketch of
 its contents it may not be useless to indicate what is the value put upon

 each result by the author, since the proofs must in many cases be entirely
 omitted.   It will be convenient to do this by numbers.
    The probability 4, then, is to be understood to imply that the matter in
 hand appears to the author to be fully made out.       He would, for example,
 assign this probability to the wave-theory  of light, and to the main features
 of the theory of the molecular constitution of gases which have been worked
 out by Clausius and others within the last twenty years.    The number 1
 will be used where an hypothesis agrees so well with such of the pheno
 mena as are known, that it is concluded that it must be either the true ac
 count       of   them, or bear some intimate        relation   to the true theory;   2   will
 indicate that we have good ground to conclude our hypothesis to be the
 true theory, although at the same time the evidence is too scanty or con
 <U+FB02>icting to free as from hesitation; 3 will indicate a proof so strong that we
 should be very much surprised if anything were eventually to disturb it;
 4, as has been already stated, will mark a conclusion fully made out; and
 to complete the series, 5 may be used for that demonstrative                proof of which
few subjects of inquiry are susceptible.
   Observations with the spectroscope have made known to us that the sun’s
outer atmosphere, that             is,
                            the part of the atmosphere which extends out
side the photosphere,      mixture of many gases, amongst which hydrogen,
                              is   a
sodium,  magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt,
copper, zinc, and barium—all of them permanent gases in consequence of
the temperature—have been detected.       Now        shown to be
                                                              it    necessary
                                                                   is          a
consequence   of the molecular constitution of gases   that in such an atmo
sphere, decreasing in temperature from within outwards, the various consti
tuent gases are not everywhere equally mixed, but that in the upper regions
those which have the lightest molecules rise the furthest, so that the gases
 overlapoue another in the order of the masses of their molecules (proba
 bility 5).      also follows from
                   It                 consideration of the vapour-densities and

 been printed above, the molecules of hydrogen being the lightest.          This,
 then,    the
         is   order  in which  the boundaries  of these gases would be met with
 in descending from the surface of the sun’s atmosphere downwards.
    This result     abundantly con<U+FB01>rmed, and in its main features raised to
                        is

mosphere,     stopped in its passage
                  is                  outwards, and the gas substitutes for               it
the much more subdued light which emanates from its own upper and
therefore coolest stratum.   Now the view enunciated in the last paragraph
                                            if
be true, these outer layers of the respective gases, from which the rays as

 1867.]                 Constitution   of the Sun and Stars.          -           27
we see them come, must be at very various temperatures, that of hydrogen
being the coldest, and the others in order after it. This is precisely in
 conformity with the observations.          The rays of hydrogen, sodium, and
 magnesium emanate from a region so cold that the lines of these elements
in the sun’s spectrum are intensely black in whatever part of the spectrum
 they may occur; in other words, the light proceeding from the upper
(layers   of these gases is so feeble that it is not in any perceptible degree
 luminous when placed in contrast with the intense background of light
 from the photosphere.        On the other hand, calcium, iron, and the rest,
 while they produce only black lines in the violet and indigo, give rise to
 lines which are sensibly less dark in the blue, and to lines which emitastill
 more considerable amount of light in the green, yellow, orange, and red,
 these colours in which a body gradually heated begins to glow.
     A detailed scrutiny of the lines emitted by the various gases leads to
 several interesting results.      Hydrogen and iron are the two most abundant
 constituents of the sun’s outer atmosphere, and play in it the same part
 which nitrogen and oxygen do in the earth’s.              There is but the merest
 trace of sodium present;        The other gases are met with in intermediate
 quantities. Again, barium cannot have a vapour-density so high as would
 appear as <U+FB01>rst from its atomic weight, and therefore probably belongs to the
 same class of elements as cadmium and mercury, which have vapour-densi
 ties half of what correspond to their atomic weights.          To these several re-  .
  sults we may attribute the probability 3.
     The photosphere consists of two strata which may be distinguished.
 The outer of these is shown to be cloud in the ordinary sense of the word,
  that is, solid or liquid matter in a state of minute division, and denser than
  the part of the atmosphere in which it is dispersed (probability 3).          This
  cloud is precipitated from its vapour by the chill produced by its own
  abundant radiation towards the sky, a chill which constitutes the shell of
  clouds a surface of minimum temperature considerably cooler than either
  the layer above it or the layer beneath (probability 3).         The hotter layer,
  which is outside the luminous         clouds, seems  to  have  a  depth somewhat
  greater than the length of the earth’s radius (probability 2).        Just outside
  it there is a second layer of luminous clouds, but so excessively thin that
  they can be seen only during a total eclipse, on which occasions a portion of
  them has been seen under the form of two arcs of cloud extending for some
  distance on either side of the points of <U+FB01>rst and last contact, where alone a
  suf<U+FB01>ciently low part of the sun’s atmosphere was disclosed (probability 3).
  Abm'e these there soar other clouds raised by causes which will be referred
  to further on.
     About the middle of the hot stratum over the photosphere there is a sur
  face of maximum temperature, outside which the temperature decreases
  almost continuously to the limit of the iron atmosphere.           A little outside
  this  there  is a second very  feeble  maximum,   the  temperature of which falls
  short of the heat of the <U+FB02>ame of a Bunsen's burner ; and outside this,
  through the immense height which is tenanted by sodium, magnesium, and

 28                   Mr. G.   J. Stoney on the Physical                [June 20,
 hydrogen    alone, the temperature goes on decreasing till it becomes exces
sively cold.    These results are made out with probabilities 2 and 3.
    Within the luminous clouds the temperature very rapidly waxes, and the
 density, too, appears to receive a nearly sudden increase.       All gases with a.
vapour-density more than about eighty times that of hydrogen are imprisoned
 within the shell of clouds by the comparative chill which there prevails,
 cooperating with the intensity of the force of gravity exerted by the sun.
 Between the <U+FB01>lm of clouds and the stratum immediately beneath there are
 violent motions of convection, which both carry up fresh vapour to be con
 densed into cloud, and carry down the cloud into a region where it becomes
 mist and rain.    It is convenient to restrict the word cloud to cloud in that
situation in which it can form, giving the names mist or rain to the cloud
when carried down, either by currents of convection or by subsidence, into
a position  from which there is not that abundant radiation towards the
sky which is essential to its forming.     The clouds, in this restricted sense
of the term, are everywhere of a gauze-like transparency to admit of the
copious radiation towards the sky which is requisite; and this enables spec
tators upon the earth to see through them the light emitted by the mist and
rain beneath. This mist and rain seem everywhere, except in the solar
spots, to be dense enough to be opake, and therefore emit the maximum
light corresponding to their temperature.       This temperature is higher than
that of the clouds, and accordingly the mist and rain constitute a back
ground brighter than the luminous clouds.
    Hence the <U+FB01>nely-granulated      appearance of the surface of the sun, the
currents of convection creating a kind of honeycombed structure in the
stratum of clouds ; the ascending currents carrying up hot vapours in which
only excessively thin cloud can form, since under these unfavourable cir
cumstances its lowest parts cannot tolerate even the slight obstruction to
their radiating freely which a cloud of the average density would offer ; and,
on the other hand, the descending currents carrying down those portions
which by prolonged radiation have cooled down abnormally, and thus be
come both more opake by the condensation of more cloud, and less bright.
Those portions which by the most persistent radiation cool down the most,
seem to furnish the very dark specks which have been taken notice of by
observers.
    Hence also arises the gradation of light which is observed upon the sun’s
disk. In the middle of the disk we look vertically through the honey
combed structure     which has been described, and    see  through it the brighter
background almost without any intervening obstruction.            But as we turn
our eyes towards the margin of the disk, we look more and more obliquely
across the columns, which progressively      intercept   increasing  quantities of
the brighter light from beyond, and substitute       for them their own feebler
radiations.
    If by disturbances in the atmosphere the hotter stratum on either side
is made in certain places to encroach upon the luminous clouds, they are
unable to maintain in this situation as low a temperature as elsewhere, and

therefore become abnormally thin. If this process is not carried so far as
to put a stop to the incessant rain beneath the clouds, their increased
transparency will give rise to a facula when the phenomenon takes place
on a large scale, and to the coarsely mottled appearance of the photosphere
where it presents itself in smaller patches.        Hence we see why a facula
retains its brightness up     to the margin  of the  sun’s dish, a phenomenon
which is inconsistent with the usually received hypothesis that the grada
tion of light on the sun’s disk is due to the absorption of the outer atmo
sphere.    If the rain also cease we have the penumbra of a spot ; if the cloud
itself is dissolved away, we have its umbra.
   The dark body which is disclosed in the umbrae and penumbrae of spots
must            be either an untarnished    ocean    of   some highly re<U+FB02>ecting opake sub
stance, or a cloud of some transparent                   material which scatters light abun—
dantly.   Both hypotheses are fully considered.
  To most of the foregoing conclusions relating to the photosphere                       and
the adjoining parts we may safely accord the probability 3,

   The trade-winds which blow over the surface of the photosphere arealso

the oblate form of the sun causing     di<U+FB02>'erence in the escape of heat from

            a                            a   temperature bordering upon that of the
photosphere.   When this occurs          it    will both produce the phenomenon of
overhanging clouds seen during eclipses, and give rise to             a    violent cyclone
in the regions beneath, immediately over the photosphere.                     There      no

other part of the sun upon which these conditions prevail: hence the limi
tation of spots to two bands parallel to the equator.               To these results we
may assign the probability        '2.
   In the next branch of the inquiry we are obliged to have pretty free re
course to speculation; and the results, though there            is    much to be said for
them,  must   be  received    with     the  caution   which    becomes    us when we are
not at liberty to     award   a    probability higher        than
                                                                1.     We are forced to
invoke an external agent to account for the periodicity of the spots; and
that which       submitted as apparently the most probable,
                is                                                        is   a  swarm of

thus tend to enfeeble the causes which pic‘illlce the trade-Winds.                   Hence

able that this hypothesis accounts also for the fact that spots prevail more
in ~one hemisphere than the other, inasmuch as the meteors must act more
on one hemisphere than the other, and lessen in   the causes that produce
                                                           it

major of the orbit of the meteors lies just along the line in which its plane
intersects the plane of the sun’s equator. It is also very remarkable that the
interval of time in which the spots go through their mutations, which we
must of course adopt as the periodic time of the meteors in their orbit,
assigns to them an aphelion distance outside and close to the orbit of one of
 the principal planets, Saturn. There is therefore very considerable ground
to suspect that there is such a swarm of meteors which was diverted into
the solar system by Saturn 4* at no very remote epoch—just as our
November meteors were brought in by the planet Uranus in the year 125
of the Christian era.
    Finally, it is shown that an hypothesis which has found much and de
served favour of late years, that the heat expended by the sun is continually
restored to him by the falling in of meteors which had been circulating
                                                                                 '
round him, is no longer tenable.
    The second part of the memoir treats of other stars. The differences in
their appearances are found to depend mainly on differences in the force of
gravity exerted at their surfaces. Where gravity on a star is feebler than
on the sun, either from the mass of the star being less, or from its being
so dilated by heat that its outer parts are further removed from its centre,
gases which by reason of the mass of their molecules are imprisoned within
the photosphere of the sun, will, when less attracted downwards, be able to
stand the coolness of the shell of clouds and pass beyond them.                     Thus
mercury, antimony, tellurium, and bismuth, all of which have too high a
vapour-density to exist in the sun’s outer atmosphere, show themselves in
that of Aldebaran. Again, in these stars all the gases of the outer atmo
sphere expand until their upper layers, those from which their spectral
lines issue, are cooler than on the sun. These spectral lines will accord
ineg be darker than on the sun, and as this will tell with most effect on
the blue end of the spectrum, it will render the light from these stars ruddy.
    On the other hand, those stars which, either from being of greater mass
than the sun, or from being less hot in their internal parts, attract down
the gases of their outer atmospheres with more force, constitute the class
of intensely white stars with a somewhat violet tinge, of which Sirius and
a Lyra are examples. Several of the substances which in the sun’s spec
trum give rise to faint lines, are on such stars con<U+FB01>ned within the photo
sphere; and the lowest temperature which other of them can withstand,
is by reason of the force'with which they are attracted downwards, hotter
than the corresponding temperatures of the sun.                Hence the substances
which on the sun cause his numerous dark              lines—sodium,   magnesium, cal
cium, chromium, manganese, iron—produce in the spectrum of the star
    '  The attraction of Jupiter would also have been competent to divert a cluster of
 meteors into an orbit of the requisite form and dimensions ; but the situation of the
orbit would in that case have caused the meteors to cross the path of Jupiter, so that the
 planet would have acted ever since as a powerful dispersing agent, and it does not seem
 likely that such  an in<U+FB02>uence has been in operation.

    lines equally numerous, but faint. There is but one exception to this.
    Hydrogen has a molecular mass so amazingly low (one twenty-third part
    of the mass of molecules of sodium, the nearest to it in this respect of the
     known constituents of stellar atmospheres), that there is probably no star
     which can exert a force of gravity so powerful as to compel hydrogen to
     limit itself to temperatures which show in any part of the spectrum a pcr~
     ceptible degree of brightness when placed upon the background of the pho
     tosphere.     In all stars accordingly in which hydrogen appears at all, the
     four hydrogen lines are found intensely black.
        We see, then, why solitary stars are found of some particular colours only.
     Stars which exert upon their outer atmospheres a force of gravity as great
     or greater than the sun’s are white: those on which gravity is a less force
     are of some ruddy tint,—yellow, orange, or red. The foregoing results are

        To account for the colours of the companions of double stars we are again
    forced to enter upon speculative ground.          If the sky be peopled with count

    visible, move only in virtue of their mutual attractions,          cannot be an ab

    soluter unusual occurrence for two stars to come into collision. Whenever
    this happens, either the two stars emerge from the frightful con<U+FB02>agration
    which would ensue as one star, or,         they succeed in disengaging them
                                                if
    selves, they  will be found  after the  catastrophe moving in new orbits. If
    their previous courses had been parabolic,       can be shown that the new re

    lative orbit will be elliptic.   Hence they will return to the charge again
    and again, and at each perihelion passage there will be       fresh modi<U+FB01>cation
                                                                        a

    asunder through one another’s atmospheres.          And the distance to which
    they will ultimately withdraw before they separate will of necessity be im
    mense, since their atmospheres must have been dilated to         vast size by the
                                                                             a
    friction to which they have been subjected.       As the stars recede from one
    another the amount of heat which they generate at each perihelion passage
    is progressively less and less, until at length the atmospheres of the stars
    shrink in the intervals between two perihelion passages more than they ex

pand when the brush takes place.       When this happens the <U+FB01>nal separation
of  the two stars is imminent,   and a new double star is on the point of being
                                            -
permanently    added to the sky.
   The astonishing appearances witnessed last year in T Coronas seem to
receive an easy explanation upon this hypothesis.        They are exactly what
we should expect upon the occurrence of one of the last perihelion passages
that take place before two stars which are in the state of transition into a
double star <U+FB01>nally separate.      The outer parts of the atmospheres becoming
engaged   would  raise to incandescence the region in which hydrogen only
is found, thus transforming what had previously been its four dark lines
into intensely bright lines.    At the same time the strata that lie further
down would be very sensibly heated, though not to incandescence—quitc
enough,   however, to lessen temporarily in a very material degree the extent
to which they at other times subdue the light of the photospheres.         This
extent would of necessity have been very great, inasmuch as the enormous
dilatation of the atmospheres must greatly enfeeble the force of gravity upon
the outer strata of both stars.
    Again, it follows as a consequence of this hypothesis that the circum
stances which most favour the formation of a double star are when the two
bodies that come into collision are of nearly equal mass.       Such cases must
be rare; but when they do occur, there is a very high probability that the
issue will be a double star.      This appears to account for the fact that a
very remarkable proportion of double stars have constituents of nearly the
same magnitude.
   Another consequence is that when the stars are very unequal, the com
panion will, as it plunges over and over again through the atmosphere of
the primary, be gradually deprived of several of its lighter gases; so that
when it <U+FB01>nally gets clear it will not emit the principal spectral lines of a
solitary star, but others which emanate from denser gases. This probably
accounts for the blue, violet, and green colours which are found in the mi
nute companions of double stars.
   Another consequence is that the orbits of double stars will almost always
have a considerable ellipticity.
   Another consequence is that the conditions      are likely not unfrequently
to arise which would separate the companion into two or more fragments ;
and that when this happens, the separate pieces will pursue paths which
are distinct from one another and not far apart.      This  seems to account for
                                                              '
such systems as 'y Andromeda.                             _
   \Vhen the same conditions act with unusual         violence they would pro
bably break up the companion into numerous fragments ; and it is remark
able that they would at the same time be likely to cause the primary to
throw of a number of rings.       The fragments and the rings would move all
in the same direction and nearly in the same plane, and each fragment
would rotate rapidly in the direction in which it revolves in its orbit.
When the fragments, as must generally happen, are of inconsiderable mass

their orbits would      be almost   certain   to degrade from ellipses into circles
before they got quite clear of the primary. Some would probably be found,
when this happens, at the distance of the rings, others within the surface of
 the primary, none beyond both.           Those within the surface of the primary
would fall into him and be lost.            But one that lay within a ring w0uld
gather by its attraction the ring round itself, and so become covered with
an immense atmosphere with which it would continue to rotate while ad
vancing in its circular orbit.        If  this rotation were sufficiently swift, the
new planet would throw off rings which might afterwards condense into
satellites, with this peculiarity, that they would always keep the same face
 turned towards the planet, and revolve round it in the same direction and
nearly in the same plane in which the planet revolves round its sun.
    The speculative element in this hypothesis is so considerable that per
haps we may not prudently yield to it a probability higher than 1.                 But
an hypothesis which carries up so many of the main phenomena of nature
to a single source, and which only asks us to admit what is not antecedently
improbable,     that the number of incandescent stars is but      a small proportion
of all  that exist, seems nevertheless to deserve to be stated.

       No.   111.”.   By    C.   Scuoausnmzn.          Communicated by Prof. G.

                               l. Di-Isopropyl, CUH“.
    Iodide of isopropyl is not perceptibly        acted upon by sodium even if the
liquid is heated to the boiling-point;            but if anhydrous ether perfectly
free   from   alcohol    is added,   a   reaction   soon commences without appli
cation of external heat; the liquid becomes warm, and the iodide is decom
posed with formation of iodide of sodium.                The chief products of this
reaction   are,   (l)  propylene, from which bromide of propylene was ob
tained by passing the gases which are evolved through bromine; (2) a
gaseous hydrocarbon, which is not absorbed by bromine and which burns
with a luminous <U+FB02>ame, probably consisting of hydride of propyl; and (3)
a liquid hydrocarbon,       which, according to its composition and mode of for;
mation, must be considered         as  di-isopropyl.     By the following method     I
 obtained the largest yield of this liquid.         A <U+FB02>ask holding about 250 cub.
 centims.   was  half <U+FB01>lled with iodide of isopropyl (which had been prepared
 by acting with hydroiodic acid upon glycerin) ; an equivalent quantity of
 sodium cut into thin pieces was added, upon this a layer ofpure ether was
 poured, and the <U+FB02>ask quickly connected with the lower end of a Liebig’s
 condenser.      Where the two liquids meet, a brisk reaction soon sets in ; the
 escaping gases carry off a large quantity of the liquid, chiefly of the more
 volatile ether, and it is therefore necessary to keep the condenser as cold as
 possible.    The reaction goes on generally quietly until the greatest portion
 of the iodide is decomposed; if it stops after a short time, gentle heat has
 to be applied as long as gas is evolved.            After the reaction is over, the

 <U+FB02>ask is heated in an oil-bath, and the liquid contents are distilled off. The
 distillate is fractionated several times, and the portion boiling between 506
 and 70° C. collected separately.           This consists chie<U+FB02>y of di-isopropyl, but
 also contains ether, undecomposed iodide of isopropyl, and may also con
 tain diallyl if the iodide was not quite pure.          In order to remove these ad
 mixtures, the liquid is repeatedly shaken with concentrated sulphuric acid
 as long as heat is evolved, then recti<U+FB01>ed, and the distillate treated with a
 mixture of strong nitric and sulphuric acid as long as iodine separates, then
 washed, dried, and recti<U+FB01>ed over potassium.
    Di-isopropyl is a colourless mobile liquid, the odour of which cannot be
 distinguished from that of hydride of hexyl, and which boils constantly at
 58° C.    The speci<U+FB01>c gravity was found to be

    If iodine   is present,   the action of the chlorine     is quite di<U+FB02>'erent.    No
trace of a monochloride        is formed; the chief product consists of bichlori
nated di-isopropyl,      Ca  H12 C12, a solid substance, besides a smaller quantity
 of high boiling products, which are very rich in chlorine.          From those the
solid chloride may be easily separated either by distillation with water, the
steam carrying the solid substance very easily over, or by cooling the mix
ture of the substitution-products          and pressing the crystals which separate
between blotting-paper.          This compound forms white crystals which smell
strongly of camphor, and, exposed to the air, soon volatilize at the com

        its Products of Decomposition.”—Part II. By A. MATTHIEsSEN,
        F.R.S., and G. C. FOSTER, BA. Received May 23, 1867.
                     _               (Abstract)
     In this  memoir the following reactions have been studied    :—
     1. The Action     of Hydrochloric and Hydriodic Acids    on Opianic Acid.
     “'hen   strong hydrochloric or hydriodic acid acts at 100° for some time
 on opianic     acid, iodide or chloride of methyl is evolved and a new acid
 formed,
                         CMHNO, +   HCl: CDHEO, + CH,C1.
     We   propose to call this acid methyl nor-opianic acid, as it stands inter
 mediate between opianic acid and the normal opianic acid :—
              Normal opianic acid   ..................      CUHUO,
             Methyl nor-opianic acid   ................     CDHGO,
             Opianic acid or dimethyl nor-opianic acid.  .  CmHmO5
    The   new acid is soluble in cold water,  but much more so in hot, from
 which it crystallizes on cooling    with  2% molecules of water.    Like hypo
 gallic acid it strikes a dark blue with sesquichloride of iron; but on addi
 tion of ammonia in excess, a light-red solution is produced, di<U+FB02>‘ering, there
 fore, from the hypogallic-acid blue, with which ammonia becomes blood
 red.     From the analysis of the silver-salt it appears that methyl nor
                                                                             ‘
 opianic acid is monobasic.                                        .
      2. The Action      quydrocltloric and Ilyclriodic Acids  on Meconin.
    W'hen meconin is heated with strong hydrochloric or hydriodic acids at
 100° for some time, it is split up into chloride or iodide of methyl and an
acid of the composition 091180,.       The reaction is
                         CmeO,+HC1=G,H,O,+CHaCl.
    This  new acid we may call methyl nor-meconic acid, as it stands between
meconin and normal meconin :—
          Meconin.........................                     CWHIOO,
          Methyl nor-meconin or methyl nor-meconic acid.       Cu Hu 0,
         Normal meconin      .........................         C, H, 0,
    Methyl nor-meconic acid is soluble in cold, but much more so in hot
water; it is easily soluble in alcohol, and slightly so in ether. It reduces
solutions of silver-salts in the cold, and behaves with sesquichloride of iron
exactly like methyl nor-opianic acid.        From the analysis of the barium
salt, methyl nor-meconic acid is monobasic.

                                    Hemipinic Acid.
   The. action of bydriodic acid on hemipinic acid has been already described
in our former communication.           The reaction which takes place was found
to be                                                          ~

The body C,H604 we called hypogallic acid.
   It was also mentioned that when hydrochloric acid acts on hemipinic
acid the following reaction takes place :—
                      CmHmOG+HCl=COa+CH3Cl+CSHBOr
   The formula CHHBO, has been con<U+FB01>rmed by further analyses, and from
the analysis of its silver-salt we have shown it to be a monobasic acid.
This acid may be called methyl-hypogallic acid, as it contains one molecule
of methyl more than the hypogallic acid, and may be converted into that
acid by the prolonged action of hydrochloric acid on it.
   4. Whilst experimenting with hemipinic acid we found that this acid
may crystallize in different forms.         The crystals were found to contain dif
ferent amounts of water; thus when it crystallizes from a dilute solution
by spontaneous evaporation, the crystals contain half a molecule of water;
when from a supersaturated solution, they contain one molecule ; and lastly,
when crystallized in the ordinary way by cooling a bot solution, they con
tain two and a half molecules.
   From the experiments here,         as well as those     in our former paper, it ap
pears that the following compounds          derived from opianic acid will be found
to exist :—

    In  the second part of the paper       the properties and the preparation       of a
new base prepared from narcotine are described. When narcotine is heated
for from six to eight days with strong hydrochloric acid at 100°, two mole
cules of chloride of methyl are given 011', and the chloride of the new base
formed. The reaction which takes place is
                   CnHuN 01+2 HCl=CmeN 07+ 20 HaCl.
This    base we have called methyl-norsnarcotine; it forms an almost white
amorphous powder insoluble in water and ether, slightly soluble in alcohol ;
it is easily soluble in carbonate of sodium, by which means it may be sepa
rated from narcotine.         None of its salts form crystalline compounds (the
chloride, sulphate, and nitrate have been made).            In the paper of which
this is an abstract, mention is made of two other new bases derived from
narcotine; these have not as yet been described.           They are the dimethyl
and    nor-narcotines,    the <U+FB01>rst being  the product of the action of hydrochloric
acid for a short time on narcotine, and the latter the product of the action
of strong hydriodic acid on narcotine. The reactions may be written
                      C<U+FB02><U+FB02><U+FB02>N O,+HC1=C.,,H.“N 07+ CHJCI

VIII.     “ On the Chemical Intensity of Total Daylight at Kew and

                                      (Abstract.)
   This communication contains the results of a regular series of mea
surements of the chemical action of daylight, carried out at the Kew
Observatory, through the kindness of Dr. Balfour Stewart, according to
the method described by the author in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1864, p. 605. The observations extend over a period of two years,
from April 1, 1865 to March 31, 1867. The second part of the com
munication gives the results of observations upon the Intensity of the
Chemical action of Sunlight under the Equator, made at Para in lati
tude 1° 28' 8. during the month of April 1866.

                                I.  Kew Observations.
   The Kew measurements do not profes to exhibit the changes in
chemical   intensity which occur from hour to hour, but they give, with
accuracy, the mean monthly chemical intensity, showing the rise and
fall with the changing seasons of the year, and they enable us to deduce
the mean monthly and yearly chemical intensities at Kew for 1865—67.
   Tables showing the daily mean chemical intensity obtained from the
daily observations, according to the method described in the above-men
tioned paper, are given.         The <U+FB01>rst result which these observations yield,
is that the mean chemical intensity for hours equidistant from noon is
constant; that is, the mean chemical intensities are equal for equal alti
tudes of the sun; thus the mean of all the observations made about
9" 30m AM. corresponds with the mean intensity at 2“ 30‘“ RM.

Hence the author concludes that when the disturbing causes of varia
tion in amount of cloud, &0. are fully eliminated by a suf<U+FB01>cient number
of observations, the daily maximum of chemical intensity corresponds to
the maximum of sun’s altitude.             The author then shows from measure
ments made at varying altitudes of the sun at Heidelberg and Parai,
that the relation between sun’s altitude and chemical intensity may be
represented by the equation
                                 CI,I = CIo + coast.     a,
where CI, represents the chemical intensity at a. given altitude (a) in
circular measure, CIo the chemical intensity at the altitude 0, and
const. (a) a number to be calculated from the observations.
   The agreement of the chemical intensities as found at Heidelberg
with the calculated results is seen in the following Table :—~

A   similar relation is found to hold good for the Para observations.
Assuming the same relation to exist at Kew as at Heidelberg and Par-i,
the values of the mean monthly intensity at noon have been calculated
from the observations at 2.30 and 4.30 mm, and the mean monthly in

                      the
 biennial variation of chemical intensity for the same period, accompany
 the paper. The curve of yearly chemical intensity is found to be un~
 symmetrical about the vernal and autumnal equinoxes; thus in spring
 and autumn the results are as follows :—

 Or for 100 chemically active rays falling during the months of March
and April 1865, 1866, and 1867 at Kew there fell in the corresponding
autumnal months 167 rays, the sun’s mean altitude being the same.
    The author discusses the probable causes of this autumnal maximum;
he <U+FB01>nds that it is not due to variation in the amount of cloud, and be
lieves that it is to be explained by a. less amount of atmospheric opales
cence in the autumn than in the spring.
    The yearly integral for the twelve months, January to March 1867
and April to December 1865, is 55-7, whereasZthat for the twelve months
of the year 1866 is 54-7.
                             II.   Par-d Observations.
    All  the knowledge we possess concerning the distribution and in
tensity of the chemically active rays in the tropics is derived from the
vague statements of photographers. According to their observations it
appears that the dif<U+FB01>culty of obtaining a good photograph increases as
we approach the equator; and more time is said to be needed to pro
duce the same effect upon a sensitive plate under the am blaze of a
tropical sun than is required in the gloomier atmosphere of London.
Thus in Mexico, where the light is very intense, from twenty minutes
to half an hour is stated to be required to produce photographic effects
which in England occupy but a minute. Hence the existence of a
peculiar retarding in<U+FB02>uence has been suggested which the heating and
luminous rays are supposed to exert upon the more refrangible portions
of the spectrum. The fallacy of these statements has been fully proved
by a series of direct measurements of the chemical intensity of sunlight
under the equator, made at Para by Mr. T. E. Thorpe. The curves of
daily chemical intensity given in the paper show that the activity of the
chemical rays in the tropics is very much greater—on one day <U+FB01>fty-<U+FB01>ve
times as great, as in our latitudes; and these measurements prove that
the reported failures of photographers cannot at any rate be ascribed
to a diminution in the chemical intensity of sunlight. The following
numbers give some of the daily mean chemical intensities at Port: com
 pared with the same days in Kew :—

The measurements        were made at Para in the middle of the rainy           sea_
 son, and at very frequent intervals during the day; the curves show the
enormous and rapid variation in intensity from hour to hour which the
chemically active rays undergo under a tropical sun during the rainy
season.
IX. “On      the Elimination of Nitrogen during Rest and Exercise on
      a regulated Diet of Nitrogen.”            By E. A. PABKEs, M.D., F.R.S.
       Received June      I,  1867.
   The experiments recorded in this paper are intended to complete the
inquiry into the effect of rest and exercise on the elimination of nitrogen
recorded in the Proceedings of the Royal Society (N0. 89, 1867).
   The experiments were made on two soldiers at the Royal Victoria
 Hospital at Netley. One of them (S.) was the subject of the former
 experiments, the other man (13.) was a. fresh man.              B. is a. perfectly
healthy temperate man, aged 22;,l years, 5 feet 91; inches in height, and
weighing 140 lbs.
   Extreme care was taken to ensure the greatest accuracy both as to
food and as to the collection of the excreta.            The whole value of such
experiments as these, depends on the exactness with which all the con
ditions are carried out; and without perfect accuracy, the results would
only mislead.     I  have every con<U+FB01>dence that the conditions were faith
fully observed; there is in fact evidence of this from the experiments
themselves.
   The course of the experiments was precisely the same as in the obser
vations recorded in the last paper, except that the diet was during sixteen
days exactly the same on each day.             During four days the men were at
their ordinary employment; during two' days rested; returned to ordinary
work for four days; took very active exercise for two days ; and were then
for four days more on ordinary occupation.
   They took each day the same amount of food, viz. :—

     The bread was made always in the same way ; the meat (steak) was
 of an uniform quality,         and was carefully selected every day.                 The whole
 quantity of food was regularly eaten and at the same time. The only
 variation was that the potatoes weighed sometimes 12 or 12%, and some
 times 13 ounces (which, however, made very little change in the nitro
gen), and that the amount of water drunk, usually 5 ounces at dinner
and 2 at supper (on eleven days), was on <U+FB01>ve days taken in less quan
tity. N0 alcoholic liquid was taken, and there was no smoking.
     This quantity of food was just suf<U+FB01>cient to preserve the body at almost
precisely the same weight ; the men were in perfect health.
    During the sixteen days 31376 grammes (viz. 19'61 x 16) of nitrogen
were known to be taken by each man in the food. The following
amounts were recovered from the urine in the same time.
             S. . . . . 303'660 grammes, or 1897 grammes daily.
             B. . . . . 307 '257 grammes, or 192 grammes daily.
    The nitrogen in the stools (as presently noted) Quite made up the
difference (10 and 6 grammes) between these numbers and the amount
of nitrogen passing in, indeed it rather exceeded it if the average of
three days can be applied to sixteen.                     S. passed regularly rather more
nitrogen by the bowels than B., and rather less by the urine.
    The weight of the body at the beginning and end was nearly the same,
and it is therefore certain that during the sixteen days no nitrogen
escaped by the skin or lungs, but that all passed by the kidneys and
                                              '
bowels.
    The urine was collected from 8 AJI. to 8 A.M., except on the second
days of rest and exercise, when it was collected from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M.,
and from 8 RM. to 8 AJL The nitrogen was determined by soda-lime,
   '  The nitrogen in the crust and crumb of broad and in the meat was determined
once ; the other amounts were calculated.

     On the days of rest the men remained in one room, sitting quite still
 or lying on the bed; they did not leave the room.
    On the <U+FB01>rst day of exercise they walked twenty-four miles on level
 ground between 8.10 AM. and 8 RM.                                   On the second day they walked
 thirty-<U+FB01>ve miles between 8.10 AJI. and 9.45 MI.
    The walking was done well, and 8., who had been the subject of the
 previous experiments of exercise on a non-nitrogenous diet, was quite
 certain that he supported the fatigue much better under the meat diet,
 than on the former occasion when he was fed on starch and butter.
    The amount of work done (the weight of their clothes being taken
 into account) was calculated by Mr. Haughton’s formula, viz., that
 walking on a level surface is equal to lifting 5,1; of the weight though

   The weight in the <U+FB01>rst period was fairly constant ; but during the rest
period one man lost 1% lb. and one other 1 1b. in weight ; the loss was gra
dual on the two days, which was different from the alternations which had
gone before; the losswas subsequently recovered from at the rate of rather
less than 7} lb. 9. day until the usual weight was regained on the third
and fourth days. As the amount of food ingesta. was not less, the loss
must have been owing to increase in the egesta.       This was certainlyan
unexpected result, but is yet quite certain.
   The nature of the increase in the egesta will appear presently.      will                           I
merely state     here  that it was not owing to any condition of    external
temperature or atmospheric humidity acting on the skin or lungs. In
the <U+FB01>rst four days of ordinary occupation the maximum temperature in
the shade was 59°, 61°'2, 64°'8, and 65° F.,while the mean of 'the maxi
mum and minimum temperatures of twenty-four hours was 51°‘2, 52°'6,
50"2, 5W4. In the rest-period of two days the maximum shade tempe
rature was 64° and 68°, and the mean temperature of the days was 543'5
and 58%. In the after-rest period, when the body was regaining weight
on the same diet, the temperature rose greatly, the maximum being
7 4°‘8, 81°‘6', 75°, and 70°, while the mean of the maximum and minimum
                                                                  ‘
was 61°, 66°‘3, 62°, and 59°‘5.
   It is evident therefore that the weight altered independently of the
external temperature; for there was scarcely any difference between the
<U+FB01>rst and rest-period, and if any action had been caused it should have
gone on in the succeeding hotter days of ordinary exercise during the
third period. The air was a little drier during the two days of rest
(653 per cent. of total humidity) than in the preceding and following
periods (72'6 and 720); but this slight difference had no effect, because
on one of the days following the rest the air was both hotter and drier
than on one of the rest-days, and yet the body gained weight.
   During the period of exercise both men lost greatly and almost equally
in weight, and then during the following period regained         so that in                     it,
four days one man had recovered his former weight, and the other man
Was only        g     lh. short.

50          Dr. Parkes   on the     Elimination of Nitrogen.     [June 20,
  The elimination   of nitrogen by the urine followed precisely the same
course in each man  ; and  allowance being made for the di<U+FB01>'erence in food,
this course was identical with that determined in the former experiments,
when the diet was non-nitrogenous.      It is certain that neither during
rest nor exercise did nitrogen pass off by the skin or lungs.
  It will be convenient to consider the total nitrogen in the <U+FB01>rst
instance.
  During the <U+FB01>rst period of four       days the total nitrogen excreted was
71'428 grammes by S. and 7 4008 grammes by B.       In the period of rest,
instead of falling the nitrogen increased in amount, so that in two days
38'274 and 38913 grammes were excreted.       This is not only more than
the half of the previous four days, but more than the amount of either
the <U+FB01>rst two or the last two days of the <U+FB01>rst period.        The greatest
increase was in the <U+FB01>rst day of rest, but in the second day the amount
was still above the mean of the previous period.
   As afterwards shown, this was not owing to lessened elimination by
the bowels ; for both the weight of the stools and the nitrogen increased
in the period of rest. It seems impossible to avoid the conclusion that
the condition of rest with an equal entry of nitrogen Was accompanied
by a daily increase of excretion by the urine of about 1 gramme more
nitrogen.
  It  may, indeed, be said that this is within the limits of error or un
avoidable variation, and may be accidental; but if so, it seems most re
markable that the result should run in the same way and be of nearly the
same amount in each case, and be con<U+FB01>rmed by the independent obser
vation of the urea.  In the third period, when the men returned to their
ordinary occupation, the nitrogen fell in both on the <U+FB01>rst day to a lower
point than had ever before been noted, and then rose gradually, so that
in the four days the amount was almost the same with that of the <U+FB01>rst
period, 7045 and 7394: grammes being excreted.         In the period of
exercise which is to be compared with that of the rest, the results were
identical with those of the former experiments when nitrogen was not
                                                                      '
supplied.
  On the <U+FB01>rst day of exercise the nitrogen in each man fell below the
corresponding day of rest by 1'626 and 1131 gramme.           In the next
twelve hours, which were almost entirely occupied in exercise, the dimi
nution was still greater, being 2'498 and 1225 grammes, which would
be equivalent to 5 and   24,1grammes for twenty-four hours. In the last
twelve hours, of rest after work, the elimination increased greatly, so
that 5142 and 3331 grammes more were excreted than in the corre
sponding rest-period; the general result being that on the whole two
days’ period of exercise, as compared with the whole period of rest, there
was an increase of about       gramme in the exercise-period in each man,
                                1
owing entirely to the large excretion in the last twelve hours.

    The <U+FB01>rst day following the exercise was a day of almost complete rest ;
 the nitrogen in both men was increased considerably over the average
 of the <U+FB01>rst and third periods, and very greatly indeed over the amount
 of the <U+FB01>rst day of the third period, the excess being 5'33 and 3568
 grammes over that day.           This was the most considerable variation in,
 the period of experiment. The nitrogen continued high all through this
 period, the result being that in the four days S. excreted 841216 and B.
80368 grammes, or 13 and (i grammes respectively in excess over the
<U+FB01>rst period of four days. It is clear indeed that during this period, the
 excretion of nitrogen must have been greater than the ingress.
   I  will not trace the changes in the urea in such detail. They Were
 almost identical with those in the total nitrogen.
   In the <U+FB01>rst period the amount of urea was almost precisely the same
in the two men. In the rest-period it increased nearly 2 grammes daily
in each man, fell during the third period to the former average, decreased
greatly during the <U+FB01>rst thirty-six hours of the exercise-period as com
pared with the rest-period, and increased in the last twelve hours ; in
the last or after-work period it also increased, though in a less propor
tion than the total nitrogen.                                                        _
   The changes in the non-ureal nitrogen were also very similar in the
two men, but will be best followed in the case of B., in whom the
 excretion of non-ureal nitrogen was more steady from day to day than
in S. It was very slightly and immaterially increased in the rest-period,
fell as slightly in the after rest-period, remained the same during the
exercise-period, and increased to nearly double in the last four days.
In S. it increased more in the rest-period and in the exercise-period
than in B., and still more in the last four days.                This increase in the
non-ureal nitrogen after exercise is con<U+FB01>rmatory of the results formerly
obtained on this point.
   If these results are looked at as a whole, it will be seen that though
the changes in the amount of nitrogen were for the most part not great,
still they were decided and evident changes, and occurred precisely in
the same way in the two men. The coincidence in the changes in the
urea and in the total nitrogen (determined by such different processes)
is a strong argument that the results were real. Throughout the whole
time the food was precisely the same, and the modi<U+FB01>cations .wcre there
fore not owing to variation in the ingress of nitrogen.
   There was some variation in the amount of urinary water; but the
                                                                          1-: 2

  52             Dr. Parkes       on the      Elimination of Nitrogen.               [June 20,
  increased excretion of nitrogen was,               I  believe, not at all connected with
  it. Thus in the <U+FB01>rst and third periods the nitrogen was almost the
  same, yet in S. the difference in the mean amount of water was 266 cub.
  centims., and in B. was 60 cub. centims.                    In S., in the <U+FB01>fth period, the
- amount of water was the same
                                               (within     6  cub. centims.) as in the <U+FB01>rst
  period, yet the nitrogen was more than 3 grammes in excess.                           If  indi
  vidual days are taken, no obvious relation appears between the urinary
  water and the nitrogen. The largest amount of water in S. (1760 cub.
  centims.) corresponded to 19'536 nitrogen, while the largest amount of
  nitrogen (23488) corresponded to 1430 cub. centims., and the next
  amount of nitrogen (21'25) was passed in only 900 cub. centims. of
  urine. In B. the largest amount of nitrogen (21'597) was contained in
  the largest amount of water (1610 cub. centims.), but almost as great
  an amount was contained in 1000 and 920 cub. centims.                            So that dif
  ferences in the amount of water cannot explain the variations in the exit
  of nitrogen.     If not owing to alteration in food, nor to variable passage
  of water through the kidneys, it seems tolerably certain that the condi
  tions of rest and exercise were the causes of the variation.
                       Excretion of Nitrogen by tke bowels.
     The two men did not have quite the same amount of intestinal excreta.
  The average daily weight (sixteen days) in the case of S. was 4-798
  ounces avoirdupois or 136 grammes; while in the case of B. they
  amounted only to 3'97 ounces, or 112'8 grammes:
     The exact daily weights are given further on, and                     I  will now merely
  state the amount of nitrogen, which was determined three times.

     B. passed (if these three days represent the mean) 0-538 gramme less
  nitrogen daily by the bowels than S., and during the <U+FB01>rst twelve days he
  passed on an average 0-6 gramme more nitrogen in the urine, so that
  during these twelve days the discharge of nitrogen by the conjoint
  channels was within 1 gramme the same in the two men; the amounts
  being in S. 238'848, and in 13. 239-757 grammes in twelve days, while
  the amount of nitrogen passing in (independent of a small amount in
  the tea, coffee, butter, &c.) was 235'32 grammes.                   This accordant result
  proves,  I believe, both the estimate of the nitrogen in the food and the
  collection and analysis of the excreta to have been accurate.                           I  was

  1867.]        Dr. Parkes   on the Elimination of Nitrogen.                53
 quite unprepared for a result so close as that the difference in the ex
 cretion of nitrogen of the two men should be only 0076 gramme, or
 scarcely more than 1 grain daily. In the last four days S. passed a little
 more nitrogen by the urine than 13., thereby reversing what had gone
 before. The stools were not analyzed during this period, but       I believe
 that the nitrogen must have been furnished by the body during these
 four days. As respects the effect of exercise on the intestinal nitrogen,
 there was a slight increase in rest over the previous period and in ex
 ercise over the rest-period.
    If the following Table (p. 54!) be analyzed, it will be found that the
 loss of weight in the rest-period was attributable in S. almost entirely
 to excess in the pulmonary and cutaneous excreta, while in B. it was
 owing to increase in the urinary and intestinal excreta.       It might be
 presumed to have been chie<U+FB02>y water; but the simultaneous changes in
 the excretion of nitrogen give it interest. The channel of elimination
in B. proves in another way that it was not owing to effect of external
temperature in the air.
    During the period of exertion the loss of weight was from increase in
the skin and lung excretion, and it is interesting to observe how parallel
it was in the two men ; the loss of weight was subsequently made up by
lessening of the skin and lung excreta.      The intestinal excreta were not
in<U+FB02>uenced either way by the exercise; and in spite of the great passage
of water by the skin, the urinary water was not affected. The antago
nism commonly stated to exist between the excretion of water by the
skin and kidneys was not perceptible.
                     Explanation   qf the preceding/acts.
   Taking into account the experiments formerly recorded as well as
those in this paper, we have to explain the following phenomena.
    1. With an unchanged ingress of nitrogen there was a slight excess
of nitrogenous excretion during rest as compared with a period of ordi
nary exercise.
   2. There was a decrease of urinary nitrogenous excretion during active
exercise as compared with a period of rest, and-this was perceptible both
when the ingress of nitrogen was stopped, as well as when nitrogen was
supplied in regular amount.
   3. There was an excess, not great, but long continued in nitrogenous
excretion after exercise.
   4. There was a retention of nitrogen in the system when it was again
supplied after having been cut off, after both rest and exercise, and
greatest in the latter case, showing that it is needed in the system, and
that an insuf<U+FB01>cient supply at one time must be subsequently compensated.
   In addition we cannot leave out of account the well-known dietetic
fact, based on experience, that much muscular work always demands
the supply of a larger amount of nitrogen.

    Both the theories of muscular action now being discussed by physio
logists seem to me insu<U+FB01>iciont to account satisfactorily for all the abOVe
facts.
    The old theory was, that a muscle was more or less destroyed during
action and was repaired during rest, and if so, it seemed reasonable to
suppose that the action of the muscles would be measured by the amount
of nitrogen eliminated. But the decrease in the nitrogenous excretion
during exercise and its very moderate increase afterwards (an increase
quite out of proportion to the amount of muscle supposed to be destroyed)
seem quite inconsistent with this view.
    The new theory, springing from the experiments of Professors Fick
and \Vislicenus, viz., that the nitrogenous framework of a muscle is
merely the machinery which allows changes in the non-nitrogenous sub
stances to take place, and that in itself it undergoes during exercise no
change, though at <U+FB01>rst sight consistent with some of the facts, does not
appear to be so with all. It does not account for the increase of nitro
genous excretion in rest, for the decrease during exertion, or for the
increase afterwards, nor in a satisfactory manner for the great retention
of nitrogen in the system which occurs after exercise on a non-nitroge
nous diet.
    There is something more in the facts than either disintegration per se,
or stability of nitrogenous composition during muscular action, will
account for.
    We must <U+FB01>nd some other explanation; and it appears to me that we
can only express the facts by saying that a muscle during action appro
priates more nitrogen than it gives off, and during rest gives o<U+FB01>' more
than it appropriates.      \Ve have, perhaps, strictly speaking, no right to
go beyond    this;  but it  seems clear that as a muscle could hardly bezsup
posed to have two simultaneous actions, we may simplify the above ex
pression by stating that during action a muscle takes nitrogen, and
during rest gives it off. To put this in other words, the action of a
muscle would seem from these experiments not to be connected with
 disintegration, but with formation; when it is in exercise the muscle
 increases, when it is quiescent it lessens in bulk.      It may seem a bold
 innovation to attempt to reverse in this way the old theory of muscular
 action, especially as the same rule would have to be applied to nutrition
 generally ; but if it explains all the facts, it is at any rate entitled to be
 fully considered.
    In  applying this expression in the explanation of the facts,        I must
 premise that the nitrogen discharged by the kidneys and bowels cannot
 be supposed to be derived solely from the muscles.         As it represents all
 the nitrogen going in,  it  must be derived from all the nitrogenous tissues,
from the nervous substance, the gland cells, the albuminous membranes
 and <U+FB02>uids, in fact from all nitrogenous structures.         That portion of it
 which is derived from the muscular system comes only in part from those

                                            We cannot alter
muscles   of respiration, of theheart, the stomach,  and intestines, &c.
\Ve cannot even reduce the voluntary muscles to a state of complete and
prolonged rest.  There must be some movement, consequently we must
not expect to <U+FB01>nd large variations in the elimination of nitrogen when
a certain number of muscles only are kept in a state of comparative rest
or exercise.
   The food passing into the body after due preparation in the stomach,
liver, and lungs, forms in the blood a reservoir or store of nutriment
from which the different parts of the body take their supply as they
require   it,or according as the special stimulus of each enables      to ap
                                                                        it

   In these two men 196 grammes, or 302 grains passed daily into, and
then out of, the store into the various nitrogenous tissues. This quantity
exactly su<U+FB01>iced in the then state of activity of all the organs to preserve
perfect action, and to keep the body-weight constant.

than exercise.    This may be understood by supposing that           in the

twenty-four hours the voluntary muscles are in state of rest for twelve,

hours, the  removal going on at the same rate for eighteen hours instead
of twelve hours will increase the exit of nitrogen 50 per cent.         Ac
cordingly during the period of rest the elimination of nitrogen increased,
and this was necessarily most marked during the <U+FB01>rst day, when the
bulk of the quiescent muscles was greater than on the second day, when
it had been reduced by excess of elimination.        I do not see how pro
perly to explain the increase during rest except in this way       the fact
                                                                   ;   if
be asI  state        it,
                no theory of muscular action can be true which does not
account for it.
   The effect on the reserve or store of nitrogen in the blood would be
to leave in    more nitrogen than usual at the end of the two days’ rest.
                it
The men then commenced ordinary occupation, and immediately the
muscles began again to contract and to assume more nitrogen in conse
quence of the increased exercise.      As they had to regain their former
composition, the elimination of nitrogen necessarily lessened, and the
reserve must have fallen to its normal amount.      They would use up the
accumulation in the reserve as well as the fresh supply, and 'the equili
brium would be restored this was nearly done in fact in twenty-four
                           ;
hours, as may be seen in the Table.
   After four days the men took excess of exercise. The elimination of
nitrogen at once lessened, because more was used by the contracting
muscles, and there were lesser intervals of rest.

1867.]       Dr. Parkes   on the   Elimination of Nitrogen.                57
  The last 10% hours of the two exercise days formed a period of rest;
and during this time the excretion increased, and this increase continued
more or less for four subsequent days.
    This might be explained by the passing off of excretory products
formed during the contraction, according to the old theory; but if so, it
seems singular that the increased excretion should have been so mode
rate, and at the same time should have been spread over so many days,
whereas on the hypothesis   I  have suggested it is easily explicable.
    During  the exercise-period the extra action of the muscles had added
a large amount of nitrogen to their structure; at the end of the time
the muscles must have been bulkier, and therefore in the succeeding
period of rest furnished a larger elimination of nitrogen than in the
after rest-period when they were smaller. Moreover, after the exercise
period there was much more rest than after the rest-period.          In the
<U+FB01>rst day after the exercise the men were tired and rested the whole day,
and even on the following days did not probably make so much exertion
as usual.     And the gradual elimination for so many days looks much
more like a temporarily enlarged organ returning slowly to its normal
size, than like the passage of accumulated excretory products ; the chief
product being the very soluble urea which is always so rapidly removed
from the muscles that scarcely any can be detected in them.
    The facts observed in the experiments on a non-nitrogenous diet
seem now to be also easily explained.     The decrease in the urea during
the period of exercise equally occurred, because the muscles used more
nitrogen in their action than in the rest-period, taking it from the store,
and thereby no doubt robbing other parts.                                -
    During the two days of exercise without nitrogen, the muscles may
have been just as well fed with nitrogen as during the experiments with
300 grains, only other parts could not have been so; other organs and
the muscles not called into play must have acquired nitrogen with more
diliiculty, and consequently when nitrogen was again given, a large
portion was retained to replenish the store and to feed the organs which
had been on short allowance.               -
    The quantity retained when nitrogen was again given did not serve (we
may suppose) to nourish muscles exhausted by the exercise (which on my
theory had even increased in nitrogenous constituents), but other parts.
     Ifthis reading of the facts be admitted, it-may be asked how      will
                                                                      it
a<U+FB01>'ect the inference drawn from the experiments of Professors Pick and
 'Wislicenus.   They determined the nitrogen discharged, calculated how
 much muscle it   represented, and then argued (and as Dr. Frankland has
 shown, correctly argued) that this amount of muscle could not have pro
 duced the mechanical force which had been exerted.      Butit   is
                                                                  apparent,
if
I     am correct, that the measure of the work must be the amount of
 nitrogen appropriated by, and not that eliminated from, the muscle,
 and this was not shown in their celebrated experiments.
    But though doubt may be raised as to the basis of their opinion,       I

  58             Dr, Parkes     on the  Elimination of Nitrogen.               [June 20,
  conceive the opinion itself was probably correct.               Because even if the
  work is done during the period when nitrogen is added, and not when it
  is eliminated, it is dif<U+FB01>cult to suppose that the changes in the nitrogen
  are on a scale large enough to account for the result, or that the trans
  formation of a particle of blood-albumen into a particle of muscle-albumen
  could be attended by any chemical changes which per 80 could equal the
  mechanical force produced.         But we can imagine that such a transforma
  tion may be the cause of changes in the non-nitrogenous substances to
  which the manifestation of force is really owing. There is no reason
  why disintegration should be more attended with such changes than
  formation. Indeed it is perhaps more often that the union of chemical
  substances is attended by signs of transformation of force than their dis
  union. Or the stimulus which causes the addition of the nitrogen to the
  muscle may at the same moment originate the changes in the non-nitro
  genous substances.
     The fact that the substances          the presence      of which in the muscle
  suspends the contraction (and therefore, if              I am right, the growth of
  muscle), appear from Ranke’s latest observations to be derived from the
  non-nitrogenous substances, is another argument in favour of the view
  that great changes go on in these substances during muscular action.
     If  the opinion of Professors Pick and Wislicenus to this extent, and
  if the experiments of Ranke and others on the effect of the e<U+FB01>‘ete pro
  ducts be adopted, the following would be the theory of muscular action
  I  would propose.
      When a voluntary muscle is brought into action by the in<U+FB02>uence of
  the, will, it appropriates nitrogen and grows; the stimulus or the act of
  union gives rise to changes in the non-nitrogenous substances surround
  ing the ultimate elements of the muscular substance which cause the
  conversion of heat into motion. The contraction continues (the will
  still acting) until the e<U+FB01>'etc products of these changes arrest it; a state of
‘
  rest ensues, during which time the e<U+FB01>'ete products are removed, the muscle
  loses nitrogen, and can again be called into action by its stimulus.
      This theory not only explains the experiments now recorded, but
  simpli<U+FB01>es our ideas both of the growth and of the wasting of muscle,
  and seems likely to cXplain more easily some processes in disease.
      It is also in greater accordance with the rules of diet derived from
  experience than the theory of Pick and Wislicenus.                 If correct, it shows
  why     the  muscle   requires nitrogen      for   its  action,   and   why increased
  action requires increased nitrogen.           The food must either supply this,
  or the store of nitrogen in the blood and other organs must be lessened ‘2
     * That an increased supply of fat, and perhaps of starches, is also desirable has long
  been practically recognized, though the store of fat already in the body renders this less
  necessary for a time. The observations of Lawes and Gilbert seem to me to render it
  possible that when a muscle parts with its nitrogen, fat is formed, and if so, a muscle
  disintegrating during rest may form a store of fat in its texture which may be further
  transformed at the next addition of nitrogen, £6. at the next contraction.

   It enables us to understand why in a well-fed body it may be some
time after nitrogen is cut off before the muscles have any dif<U+FB01>culty in
obtaining what they want, and why in a body ill-supplied with nitrogen
exertion lessens, or if kept up produces bad effects.
     Ifexertion is persevered in under such circumstances, a failure
somewhere is always observed.     Frequently the nervous system or the
heart shows signs of weakness, a result which could hardly be explained
by the view of the Swiss Professors.    It is certainly an argument for
                I
the view have advocated, that it is in harmony with the teachings of
experience, and restores to the rules of diet their old signi<U+FB01>cance.

     I    reeeived   late last night No. 91        of the Proceedings of the Royal
Society, and desire to o<U+FB01>'er the following remarks on the abstract
of  a paper by Mr. Neumayer which              I
                                          <U+FB01>nd therein (vol. xv. p. 4114).
   Mr. Neumayer is evidently unacquainted with the Note by me, read to
the Royal Society of London in 1861 (Proc. Roy. Soc. vol. x. p. (£75), in
which       I
          stated as result of the discussions of <U+FB01>ve years’ observations at
Trevandrum (near the magnetic equator) that the lunar-diurnal varia
tion of magnetic declination became inverted, like the solar-diurnal
variation, when the sun passed from one hemisphere to the other,
both the solar- and lunar-diurnal variations depending on the position
of the sun.
     Ialso stated the laws of the lunar-diurnal variation, not only for
the moon north and south, as Mr. Neumayer has done, but also for
the moon on the equator moving northwards, and again on the equator
moving southwards, the laws being different for the moon in the same
position according as she was moving in one direction or in the other.
     Ipointed out in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edin
burgh (vol. xviii. p. 354), that the reversal of movement of the declina
tion-needle with the sun north and south of the equator, observed
within the tropics, had its equivalent in the different ranges of the
solar-diurnal variation for summer and winter in high latitudes.          It
followed in like manner that, the lunar-diurnal variation being inverted
with the solar-diurnal variation near the equator, a similar difference
 of ranges should be observed in the laws of lunar-diurnal variation for
 summer and winter in the higher latitudes.         Of this fact satis<U+FB01>ed  I
 myself by   a  rediscussion   of the  Makerstoun   observations,  after re
jecting the large disturbances.
    Another consequence of the law of inversion                of‘
                                                          the lunar-diurnal
variation near the equator with the sun’s passage from one hemi
 sphere to another, and with the inversion of the solar-diurnal varia
tion, was the opposition or approximate opposition of the mean curves

60                      On the Great Nebula in Orion.                [June 20,
 of lunar-diurnal     variation in the higher latitudes of the two hemi
 spheres.     This conclusion, howevcr evident at the time my note was
written (1861), appeared opposed to the fact, since the law of lunar
 diurnal variation at Toronto, according to General Sabine’s discussion,
 was an inversal of that at Prague and Makerstoun, all three places
in the same hemisphere; this          I pointed out at the time (Proc. Roy.
 Soc. vol. x. p. 475).         This statement seems to have caused a re
examination of the Toronto discussion, as General Sabine afterwards
 discovered that west had been substituted for east in his original
 memoir.
    It  followed from the similarity of the laws for the sun and moon
discovered     by me, and, this correction made, from the observations in
the two hemispheres, that the mean law for a north latitude should be
the inverse of that for a south latitude; or that a maximum of easterly
declination in one hemisphere should be simultaneous, or nearly so,
with a minimum in the other.
    My chief object now is to draw attention to the fact (published in
1861) of the similarity of the changes of the laws of solar- and lunar
diurnal variations of the magnetic needle, with the sun’s change of
declination, as this fact appears to have escaped the notice of those
men of science who since then have been engaged in proving inde
pendently the conclusions which follow from the note now referred to.
    Mr. Neumayer remarks “that in some cases the lunar-diurnal
variation manifests itself in a very striking manner during the winter
                           I
months.” This fact had already remarked in the discussion of the
Makerstoun observations for 1844 and 1845 ; but            I  have shown in a
paper forwarded lately to the Royal Society of Edinburgh that the
effect of the lunar action is sometimes greater than that of the solar
action; and this is made evident from the lunar-diurnalrariations for
single days, as well as in the means deduced from a single lunation
(Dec. 1858 to Jan. 1859) for each of the four positions of the moon
already referred to.

   In  this paper an account is given of the observations which have been
made with      the 3-feet and 6-feet telescopes on the great Nebula in
Orion during the last eighteen years.            The observations are accom
panied by    an  elaborate   drawing.
   In the year 1852, Mr. Bindon Stoney made a drawing of the Huy

                                                                '

genian region; it was repeatedly compared with the nebula by several
persons, and we believe therefore that it was quite accurate.           It is
not now an exact representation of the nebula as it exists, conse
quently there seems to be strong evidence of change.
   The observations were continued by Mr. Hunter from 1860 to 1861,
and by me to the present time. A drawing was made by Mr. Hunter
while he was assistant, and it has been veri<U+FB01>ed by me in almost all its
details, and extended considerably. In one place, where there is a dis
agreement between Mr. Hunter’s drawing and mine, Mr. Hunter had
previously been under the impression that some change Was going on.
   The nebula, when nearly on the meridian, was examined with the
                                                                              '
6~feet instrument and with the 3-feet instrument, before and after that
time. The appearance of the nebula differs from night to night, as the
faint details come out more or less perfectly in the different states of
the atmosphere; but the drawing represents it as seen on the best
nights.
   The present drawing contains many new stars, some laid down by
the micrometer, and others by eye estimation. The nebula has been
traced to a distance of fully 40' North, and about the same distance
South of the trapezium, on the following side to a distance of about
30', and to a much greater distance on the preceding side.
   As to resolvability, the brighter parts contain a great number of
minute stars, generally of a reddish colour. With the spectroscope
three bright lines were seen, but there was no certain evidence of a
continuous spectrum. The results arrived at by means of the spec
troscope do not, howeVer, appear to be at variance with our observations
on resolvability, as even if the whole nebula were to consist of minute
stars, the continuous spectrum produced by them would still be ex
tremely faint.

XIII.    “ On the 1dentity of the Body in the Atmosphere which
       decomposes Iodide of Potassium with Ozone.” By THOMAS
       Aunnsws, M.D., F.R.S. Received June 20, 1867.
    It was assumed for many years, chie<U+FB02>y on the authority of Schiinbein,
that the body in the atmosphere which colours iodide-of-potassium
paper is identical with ozone; but this identity has of late been called
in question, and as the subject is one of considerable importance,         I
 submitted it lately to a careful investigation, the results of which I beg
 to lay brie<U+FB02>y before the Society. The only property of ozone, hitherto
 recognized as belonging to the body in the atmosphere, is that of setting
free the iodine in iodide of potassium ; but as other substances, such as    _
 nitric acid and chlorine, which may possibly exist in the atmosphere,
 have the same property, no certain conclusion could be drawn from
this fact alone.
    One of the most striking properties of ozone is its power of oxidizing
mercury, and few experiments are more striking than that of allowing
some bubbles of electrolytic oxygen to play over the surface of one or
two pounds of mercury. The metal instantly loses its lustre, its mo
bility, and its convexity of surface, and when moved about it adheres in
thin mirror-like <U+FB01>lms to the sides of the containing glass vessel. The
body in the atmosphere acts in the same way upon pure mercury ; but,
from the very minute quantity of it which is at any time present, the
experiment requires some care in order that the effect may be observed.
On passing a stream of atmospheric air, which gave the usual reactions
with test-paper, for some hours over the surface of mercury in a U-tube,
the metal was distinctly oxidized at the end at which the air <U+FB01>rst came
into contact with it.
   This experiment, however, cannot be considered conclusive, as mercury
will tarnish and lose its mobility under the in<U+FB02>uence of many bodies
besides ozone.
   It is well known that all ozone reactions disappear when ozone
is passed through a tube containing pellets of dry peroxide of man
ganese, or other body of the same class.       The same thing occurs with
the substance supposed to be ozone in the atmosphere.       About 80 litres
of atmospheric air were drawn, at a uniform rate, through a tube con
taining peroxide of manganese, and afterwards made to play upon very
delicate test-paper. Not the slightest coloration occurred, although the
same paper was distinctly affected when 10 litres of the same air, with
out the interposition of the manganese tube, were passed over it.
   But the action of heat furnishes the most unequivocal proof of the iden
tity of the body in the atmosphere with ozone. In a former communi
cation (Phil. Trans. for 1856, p. 12)  I  showed that ozone, whether ob
tained by electrolysis or by the action of the electrical brush upon oxy
gen, is quickly destroyed at the temperature of 237° C.      An apparatus

64                On the Anatomy      of Balmnoptera rostrata.        [June 20,
was <U+FB01>tted up, by means of which a stream of atmospheric air could be
heated to 260° C. in a globular glass vessel of the capacity of 5 litres. On
leaving this vessel, the air was passed through a U-tube, one metre in
length, whose sides were moistened internally with water, while the
tube itself was cooled by being immersed in a vessel of cold water.    On
passing atmospheric    air in a favourable state through   this apparatus,
at the rate of three litres per minute, the test-paper was distinctly
tinged in two or three minutes, provided no heat was applied to the
glass globe.    But when the temperature of the air, as it passed through
the globe, was maintained at 260° 0., not the slightest action occurred
upon the test-paper, however long the current continued to pass.
Similar experiments with an arti<U+FB01>cial atmosphere of ozone, that       with
                                                                        is,
the air of   alarge chamber containing      small quantity of electrolytic
                                             a
ozone, gave precisely the same results. On the other hand, when small
quantities of chlorine or nitric acid vapour, largely diluted with air,
were drawn through the same apparatus, the test~papcr was equally
a<U+FB02>'ected, whether the glass globe was heated or not.
   From these experiments        consider myself justi<U+FB01>ed in concluding
                                  I
that the body in the atmosphere, which decomposes iodide of potassium,
is identical with ozone.

  In this paper the authors give an account of the dissection of young a
female of the Lesser Fin or Piked Whale, which was captured off
Clougher Head, Co. Louth, Ireland, on the 8th of May 1863.
  After describing its external form, and giving accurate measure
ments of its various parts, the authors point out some differences be
tween the relative sizes and positions of the organs of the animal as
contrasted with similar parts of those of the same species which have
been recorded by previous writers, especially as regards the position of
the dorsal <U+FB01>n, which appendage seems to vary in situation in different
individuals   and show, that consequently no value, as indicative of

    The myology of    the different regions of the animal has been closely
investigated, especially the rudimentary muscles of the paddle, which
latter the authors have minutely examined.
    The anatomy of the mouth, pharynx, and blowholes       is described, and
the mechanism by which the functions of respiration and deglutition
are performed. In connexion with the larynx, a remarkable muscular
pouch is mentioned as existing, which appendage is supposed by the
authors to be accessory to the act of expiration, serving a somewhat
similar of<U+FB01>ce to that of the air-reservoir in a double-action bellows.
Directly in front of the glottis there existed a peculiar hood-like fold of
mucous membrane arranged in such a way as to allow of its being
drawn over the ori<U+FB01>ce, and so prevent the entrance of all foreign sub
stances into the respiratory tract during the act of deglutition.
    The tongue was found <U+FB01>xed, as far as its tip, by a thick fraanum.
The lateral walls of the submaxillary cavity were thrown into folds,
thereby admitting of considerable distention, this arrangement being
peculiarly adapted to the feeding requirements of the animal.            The
 number of baleen plates found in the specimen was 280 on each side.
    The muscles for acting on the blowholes were arranged in three
 strata, the super<U+FB01>cial and deepest layers being used in opening, and the
intermediate one for closing the nasal canals.
    The anatomy of the eye and ear is fully described in the original
 paper, together with that of the digestive, nervous, and vascular
 systems; in connexion with this last, remarkable vascular retia were
 found, situated in the axillary, submaxillary and cervical regions.
    In the preceding brief abstract the writers have endeavoured to give
 an outline of their numerous observations on the anatomy of this Ceta
 eean, believing that it presents many features of novelty and interest
not hitherto recorded.

being to throw the delicate <U+FB01>bres into strong relief. By adopting
those methods,        the author has been able to show that the arrangement
of the <U+FB01>bres in the stomach remarkably resembles that found in the
heart' and bladderi'. This is particularly the case in the human sto
mach, where the <U+FB01>bres are most highly differentiated.                  In it the <U+FB01>bres
pursue complicated, but well-marked directions ; the most external and
most internal <U+FB01>bres maintaining a more or less longitudinal course,
the deeper or more central ones becoming more and more oblique as
the centre of the parietes is reached.
     The <U+FB01>bres cross each other with great regularity, both from without
 and from within, the longitudinal intersecting the very oblique at nearly
 right angles, the slightly oblique and oblique at more acute angles. The
 slightly oblique, oblique and very oblique <U+FB01>bres are spiral in their
 nature, and form, or tend to form, <U+FB01>gure-of-S loops.                 These loops are
 directed towards the greater and lesser curvatures of the stomach, but
 are also traceable on the great cul-de-sac or fundus, and on the lesser
 cul-de-sac or antrum pylori.          As a result of the looped distribution of
 the <U+FB01>bres, the root of the oesophagus and the pylorus are invested with
 oblique and very oblique spiral <U+FB01>bres, arranged symmetrically in two
 sets. These <U+FB01>bres pursue oppoeite directions, and surround the entrance
 into and exit from the stomach after the manner of sphincters.                       The
 crossing and looping of the <U+FB01>bres extends also to the body of the viscus,
 and shows that the so-called circular layer is in reality composed of very
 oblique spiral <U+FB01>bres, intersecting at very obtuse angles.
     The <U+FB01>bres are arranged in different planes or strata, and may be
 divided into external and internal sets. These are united to each other
 by a mutual interchange of <U+FB01>brous <U+FB01>laments; and the <U+FB01>bres of the
 several strata interweave to a slight extent, so that the term layer must
 be used in a. restricted sense.         The layers are indicated by the prevail
 ing direction of the <U+FB01>bres, and are something like seven in number,
three external and three internal, with an intermediate or central layer
 between.
     The <U+FB01>bres having the same direction, are in some instances strongly
 developed at one part of their course, and feeny at another.                  They even
 become gradually attenuated, until they are no longer discernible. The
 muscular coat of the stomach is thickest towards the pylorus: and root
 of the (esophagus; then along the lesser curvature on either side of the
 mesial line; then along the greater curvature.                It is thinnest on the
 anterior and posterior surfaces, and towards the cardiac end.

   The gradual diminution in        the thickness of the coat  of the  stomach
is occasioned by the <U+FB01>bres of        one layer or stratum radiating and be
coming more and more         delicate, while those of another and opposite
layer converge and become stronger and stronger; it usually happening
that the stronger <U+FB01>bres supplement the weaker ones, so that the parietes,
although not of uniform thickness, are not suddenly strong and weak in
parts, but graduated.     The only sudden thickening occurs in the shape
of two ridges which run along the lesser curvature about an inch apart.
The ridges in question are very distinct in the stomach of the Cat.
They can also be detected in a modi<U+FB01>ed form in the stomach of the
 Monkey and of Man.

XVI. “ On       a Self-acting Apparatus for multiplying and maintain
      ing Electric Charges, with applications to illustrate the Voltaic
      Theory.”       By Sir W. THOMSON, F.R.S., Glasgow University.
       Received    June  19, 1867.
   In  explaining the water-dropping collector for atmospheric electricity,
in  a lecture   in the Royal Institution in 1860,    I  pointed out how, by
disinsulating the water-jar and collecting the drops in an insulated
vessel, 8. self-acting electric condenser is obtained.      If, owing to elec
tri<U+FB01>ed bodies in the neighbourhood, the potential in the air round the
place where the stream breaks into drops is positive, the drops fall
away negatively electri<U+FB01>ed; or vice oersd, if the air potential is negative,
the drops fall away positively electri<U+FB01>ed. The stream of water descend
ing does not in any way detract from the charges of the electri<U+FB01>ed
bodies to which its electric action is due, provided always these bodies
are kept properly insulated; but by the dynamical energy of <U+FB02>uid
motion, and work performed by gravity upon the descending drops,
electricity may be unceasingly produced on the same principle as by
the electrophorus.     But, as in the electrophorus, there was no provision
except good insulation for maintaining the charge of the electri<U+FB01>ed
body or bodies from which the induction originates. This want is
supplied by the following reciprocal arrangement, in which the body
charged by the drops of water is made the inductor for another stream,
the drops from which in their turn keep up the charge of the inductor
 of the <U+FB01>rst.
   To stems connected with the inside coatings of two Leyden phials
are connected metal pieces, which, to avoid eircumlocution,        I  shall call
inductors and receivers.      Each stem bears an inductor and a. receiver

streams of uninsulatcd water are arranged to break into
                                                                         .

The drops fall along the remainder of the axis of the in
                                                                             ~T
ductor, and thence downwards, along the upper part of the              \
axis of the receiver of the other jar, until they meet the               .
funnel. The water rc-forms into drops at the <U+FB01>ne mouth
of the funnel, which fall along the lower part of the axis of
the receiver and are carried off by a proper drain below
the apparatus. Suppose now a small positive charge of
electricity be given to the <U+FB01>rst jar. Its inductor electri<U+FB01>es
negatively each drop of water breaking away in its centre
from the continuous uninsulated water above; all these
drops give up their electricity to the second jar, when they ‘
meet the funnel    in its receiver.‘ The drops falling away
from the lower <U+FB01>ne mouth of the funnel carry away ex- .
cessively little electricity, however highly the jar may be charged;
because the place where they break away          is, as  it were, in the in
terior of a   conductor, and therefore has nearly zero electri<U+FB01>cation.
The negative electri<U+FB01>cation thus produced in the second jar acts,
through its inductor, on the receiver of the <U+FB01>rst jar, to augment the
positive electri<U+FB01>cation of the <U+FB01>rst- jar, and causes the negative elec
tri<U+FB01>cation of the second jar to go on more rapidly, and so on. The
dynamical value of the electri<U+FB01>cations thus produced      is drawn from the
energy of the descending water, and   is   very approximately equal to the
integral work done by gravity, against electric force on the drops in
their path from the point where they break away from the uninsulated
water above, to contact with the funnel of the receiver below.        In the
<U+FB01>rst part of this course each drop will be assisted downwards by electric
repulsion from the inductively electri<U+FB01>ed water and tube above it; but
below a  certain point of its course the resultant electric force upon will
                                                                        it
be upwards, and, according to the ordinary way         of viewing   the compo
sition of electric forces, may be regarded as being at <U+FB01>rst chie<U+FB02>y upward
repulsion of the receiver diminished by downward repulsion from
the water and tube, and latterly, the sum of upward repulsion of the
receiver and upward attraction of the inductor.       The potential method
gives  the integral amount,  being the excess of work done against electric
force, above work performed     by electric force on each drop in its whole
path. It   is   of course equal to mV, if   us denote the quantity of elec

tricity carried by    each drop, as it breaks from the continuous water
above, and V      the  potential of the inner coating of the lower jar, the
potential of the uninsulated water being taken as zero. The practical
 limit to the    charges acquired is either when one or other of them is so
  strong as to cause sparks to pass across some of the separating air-spaces,
  or to throw the drops of water out of their proper course and cause
  them to fall outside the receiver through which they ought to pass.
  It is curious, after commencing with no electricity except a feeble
  charge in one of the jars, only discoverable by a delicate electrometer,
  to see in the course of a. few minutes a somewhat rapid succession of
  sparks pass in some part of the apparatus, or to see the drops of water
  scattered about over the lips of one or both the receivers.
      The Leydenjars represented in the sketch (<U+FB01>g. 2) are open-mouthed jars
                                                  I
  of ordinary <U+FB02>int glass, which, when very dry, generally <U+FB01>nd to insulate
  electricity with wonderful perfection.      The inside coatings consist of
   strong liquid sulphuric acid, and heavy lead tripods with vertical stems
   projecting upwards above the level of the acid, which, by arms projecting
   horizontally above the lip of the jar, bear the inductors and receivers as
   shown in <U+FB01>g. 2. Lids of gutta percha or sheet metal close the mouth
   of each jar, except a small air-space of from g to 1} of an inch round the
   projecting stems.     If a tube (<U+FB01>g. 3) be added to the lid to prevent
   currents of air from circulating into the interior of the jar, the in.
   sulation may be so good that the loss may be no more than one per
   cent. of the whole charge in three or four days.    'le0 such jars may be

I may take this      opportunity of describing an application of it to illus
trate a very important fundamental part of electric theory.                         I    hope
soon to communicate to the Royal Society a description of some other
experiments which        I  made seven years ago on the same subject, and
which    I hope now to be able to prosecute further.
    Using only a single inductor and a single receiver, as shown in <U+FB01>g. 1,
let the inductor be put in metallic communication with a metal vessel
or cistern whence the water <U+FB02>ows; and let the receiver be put in com
munication with a delicate electrnscope or electrometer.                     If the lining
of the cistern and the inner metallic surface of the inductor be di<U+FB02>'erent
metals, an electric effect is generally found to accumulate in the receiver
and electrometer. Thus, for instance, if the inner surface of the in
ductor be dry polished zinc, and the vessel of water above be of copper,
the receiver acquires a continually increasing charge of negative elec
tricity. There is little or no effect, either positive or negative, if the
inductor present a surface of polished copper to the drops where they
break from the continuous water above: but if the copper surface be
oxidized by the heat of a lamp, until, instead of a bright metallic sur
face of copper, it presents a slate-coloured surface of oxide of copper
to the drops, these become positively electri<U+FB01>ed, as is

or copper, there seems to be little difference in the

I. “ On      the Colouring and Extractive Matters of Urine.”—-Part                       I.
        By EDWARD Scmmcx, F.R.S.                   Received June 29, 1865*.
    Of   all the animal     secretions   urine    is  undoubtedly      one of the      most
important.       Its varying    properties,    in health    as well    as  in disease,  the
frequency with which it is emitted, and the consequent facility with which
it may be submitted to examination, render it invaluable to the physiolo
gist and pathologist as a means of throwing light on the processes, either
healthy or morbid, going on within the body.                   Its study has therefore
 engaged the attention of physicians since the earliest times, and of chemists
 from the period when chemical analysis was <U+FB01>rst employed in the exami
 nation of natural objects.        Notwithstanding the labour bestowed on the
 subject by many      eminent   men   during the past sixty years, it is still, how
 ever, far from being exhausted.              There are, indeed, portions of the
 chemistry of urine concerning which our ignorance is almost complete.
 It is one of these obscurer parts of the subject that I have endeavoured to
 clear up, and I hope to succeed in showing that I have added at least a
 few facts to the sum of our previous knowledge.
     Of all the properties of urine none is more obvious, even to the ordinary
 observer, than its colour.         The variations in tint which it exhibits at
 different times are striking, even to the unpractised eye, and they some
 times serve as important indications to the phyician.                  Nevertheless con
 cerning the chemical nature of the substances to which its colour is due
 very little is known.        Our ignorance on this subject may be ascribed to
  various causes. In the <U+FB01>rst place, some of these substances occur in the
  urine only occasionally, and in very minute quantities, so that the prepa
  ration of a quantity suf<U+FB01>cient for chemical examination becomes dif<U+FB01>cult
  and even impossible,       especially when the urine containing them is not
  abundant.     Secondly,    it has been found that some of them are very easily
  decomposed,     so much so that the mere heat required for the evaporation
  of  the urine   seems  to be sufficient    to e<U+FB01>'ect a change in their properties
  and composition.      It  therefore becomes doubtful, after a long process has
  been gone through for the purpose of separating any colouring-matter from
  the other constituents of the urine (a process in which, perhaps, strong
  chemical reagents have been employed), whether the substance procured
  was originally contained as such in the urine, or is not rather a product
  resulting from the decomposition of some other substance or substances.
  Thirdly, several of the bodies colouring the urine possess very few charac
  teristic properties.    They are amorphous and syrup-like, and they retain
  water with so much pertinacity that on attempting to dry them they
  undergo decomposition.         Neither their compounds nor their products of
   decomposition    exhibit  any distinguishing characteristics.           They belong to
   a class on  which, for want of a better, the name extractive            matter  has been

74                   Mr. E. Schunck on   the Colouring   and             [Recess,
conferred.    With some chemists, to call a body an extractive matter is to
place it among a class which is held to be unworthy of minute examina_
tion.   To others the name extractive matter is merely a convenient word
for a mixture, sometimes occurring in nature, of certain de<U+FB01>nite, perhaps
even crystallized substances, which, by appropriate means, may be resolved
into its constituents, and thus be made to disappear entirely from the list
of de<U+FB01>nite chemical bodies. As regards the extractive matter of urine, this
view may to some extent be justi<U+FB01>ed, when we recollect that from what
was considered to be extractive matter sixty years ago, such well-character
ized substances as urea, hippuric acid, and creatine have been successively
eliminated; and it is therefore natural to expect that by further research
it will be found to contain others of the same nature.    I believe this view
to be erroneous; and I shall succeed, I hope, in showing that, after having
removed from the extractive matter of urine everything which can assume
a de<U+FB01>nite form, there remains a residuum which cannot be further resolved
without decomposition.     Still, any one holding this view is not likely to
undertake the investigation of extractive matters as such, unless it be for
the purpose of obtaining something which may be supposed to be contained
in them. Lastly, the properties of these colouring and extractive matters,
however important they may be to the physiologist and pathologist,           pre
sent so little that is interesting to the chemist, that the latter would
                                                                      pro
bably not occupy himself with their examination unless for some particular
purpose.    For myself,    I frankly confess that, had   I
                                                        not had a special
object in view, this investigation would not have been undertaken.    The
information   for the sake of which it was commenced having been obtained,
I   should    then have abandoned all further inquiry, had I not found
reason to suppose, in the course of my experiments, that a more extended
investigation would lead to results interesting from a physiological point of
view.    My endeavours have, I think, been attended with some measure of
success ; and should physiologists, on becoming acquainted with the results,
be of the same opinion, my labour will not have been quite in vain.
   The colouring-matters which occurr in, or have been obtained from,
urine may be divided into three classes, viz. :—
   lst. Those which are only found occasionally in           it,   in consequence
either of disease or of some abnormal state of the system.
   2ndly. Those which are produced by spontaneous decomposition, or            by
the action of reagents on substances, either coloured or colourless, pre
existing in the urine.

to urine, may be conveniently divided, according to their colour, into three
classes, viz., blue, purple or red, and black or brown colouring-matters.
   The     appearance      of a blue colouring-matter                 in urine has been frequently

                      the
more easily soluble in alcohol and ether, to which it communicates a <U+FB01>ne
purple colour.
   The deposits of urate of ammonia and urate of soda, which are formed
in urine during fever and other diseases, are always found to exhibit
different shades of red, varying from pink to carmine.     To what this
colour      is    to be            attributed     has not     yet been satisfactorily             ascertained.
Proust *, who was the <U+FB01>rst chemist to examine these deposits, thought
that he had discovered in them a peculiar coloured acid, which he called
rosacic acid.  It is almost certain, however, that the acid properties of
this body were due to an admixture of uric acid. Indeed, Vauquelin, after
an examination of this so-called acid, arrived at the conclusion that it was
a compound of ordinary uric acid with an intensely red colouring-matter.
Vogcl        true, professed to have obtained pure rosacic acid by treating
           1‘,   it   is
the crude deposits with boiling alcohol, but as, according to him,     con                            it   is
verted with great facility into uric acid by the action of sulphuric and
nitric acid,    very probable that his substance still contained some of
                      it   is
the latter acid, and that the supposed conversion consisted merely in                                               a
destruction of the organic colouring-matter. Fromherz and Gugerti‘ also
made some     experiments with these red deposits, from which they infer
that rosacic acid consists of      neutral, red extractive colouring-matter,
                                                   a
mixed with uric acid and nrate of soda, which may be separated by treat
ing the mixture <U+FB01>rst with water and then with warm alcohol, which dis
solves the colouring-matter.     The latter, after being thus separated from
the other constituents, no longer yields uric acid.     Prout§ suggested that
the colour of the red deposits might be due to pnrpurste of ammonia, the
purpuric acid being formed in some unexplained manner by the action of
nitric acid on     portion of the uric acid contained in them. To this                                              it
was objected                by a
                    Berzeliusl] that purpurate of ammonia           insoluble in             is
alcohol. He mixed urate of ammonia with            solution of     purpurate in
                                                                       a                     a
acetic acid, which does not destroy the colour, and he observed that the
precipitated uric acid acquired      pale pink colour closely resembling that
                                                      a
of the urinary deposits; but this colour was not removed by boiling alcohol,
in which, on the contrary, the colouring-matter of the red deposits        easily                       is
soluble.    Duvernoy<U+FB01>l   asserts that he  succeeded  in  preparing    colouring                   a
matter identical with that of the red deposits by evaporating ordinary

 healthy urine to one-third or one-fourth of its volume, adding a little nitric
acid, allowing it to stand for a day, during which time the colour of the
liquid changed from yellowish brown to dark red, and then mixing with a
solution of urate of potash.            A precipitate was thereby formed of uric acid,
having the same red colour as the natural red deposits, from which the red
colouring-matter could be extracted by means of alcohol. Recent observers
have given names to this colouring-matter,                 such as uroerg/thrine and purpu
rine, without, however, adding anything of importance to our knowledge of its
properties.       The method adopted by them for its preparation is essentially
the    same as that <U+FB01>rst suggested by the earlier chemists.                          The deposits
containing     it  are  washed    with   water,  and     then   digested    with   warm   absolute
alcohol, which takes up the colouring-matter and, after <U+FB01>ltration and eva
poration at a temperature not exceeding 50°C., leaves it in the form of a
red amorphous residue.             It cannot be obtained by evaporating the urine
containing     it  ;  but  on  dissolving white and pure urate of ammonia in urine
(which by its pink or purple colour indicates the presence of purpurine), the
salt is precipitated, on cooling, deeply coloured, and yields the colouring
matter on being treated in the way just described.                        It is not improbable
that    this  purpurine       and  the   blue   colouring-matter         just referred to may
stand in some relation to one another. An observation made by Angelini *
seems to favour this view.             This chemist, being desirous of examining the
pink deposit which was being formed in his own urine during an attack of
fever, had it collected and laid aside; but being unable, from the state of
his health, to examine it at once, it remained for some days exposed to the
 atmosphere, and during this time the pink colour changed in many places
 into blue.      On leaving it to stand for some time longer, the blue tint did
not spread further, but the spots became darker in colour.
    Instances of black urine are even of rarer occurrence than those of urine
 coloured blue. Indeed in many cases the black colour seems to have been
 due to red or purple pigments, which communicated to the urine so "deep
 at tint as to make it appear black.               Dulk, for instance, obtained from a
 black urine a substance of the same colour containing iron, which Berzelius'l'
 with some reason suspected to be merely hematine.                        In the case described
 by   Marcet   I,   the  urine   appears    to have     been   purple,    or purplish-brown in
the <U+FB01>rst    instance,    and   to have   become     black    on   standing.      It contained no
red blood-globules and no trace of iron, and yielded no coloured deposit on
standing for a length of time, the colouring-matter                     being kept in solution
by    the alkali,    which   was  always present        in  excess.     This colouring-matter
was examined by           Prout,  who     gave  it   the    name     of melanic     acid.   It was
precipitated from the urine by means of acids in black <U+FB02>ocks, which were
found to be nearly insoluble in water and alcohol, but readily soluble in
caustic and carbonated alkalies, the solutions being of a very dark colour.

The solution in ammonia gave copious brown precipitates, with metallic
salts.  Marcet concludes from the experiments of Front that this so-called
acid bears a close analogy to the products derived from uric acid; but
Berzelius remarks that it strongly resembles the black pulverulent substance,
insoluble in alcohol, which is formed by the action of concentrated acids
on the extractive matters of urine.    By heating the urine yielding cyano
urine, after separation of the latter by <U+FB01>ltration, Braconnot obtained a
black sediment which he called melanourine.    I should at once have assumed
that this substance was identical with Prout’s melanic acid, if Braconnot
had not stated that his black pigment was soluble in weak acids and in
soluble in alkalies, whilst the behaviour of melanic acid to acids and
alkalies is exactly the reverse.    Considering the facility with which the
 ordinary extractive matters of urine are decomposed, yielding products in
soluble in water of a black or brown colour, it is surprising that urines
containing        these bodies ready formed should not more frequently be met
with in        cases of disease. It is not improbable, however, that the dark
hrown colour of some urinary calculi may be owing to one or the other of
these bodies.
     II.
       The second class of urinary colouring-matters comprises those which
are formed from urine by arti<U+FB01>cial means, and consequently do not exist
ready formed in the secretion.    These may also be classi<U+FB01>ed according to
colour, those which have hitherto been observed being either blue, red, or
brown.
     I   believe that    Helleri‘   was the <U+FB01>rst   to obtain   arti<U+FB01>cially from urine
colouring-matters of a pure blue or red tint. He states, in his <U+FB01>rst memoir
on the subject, that in some diseases the urine contains a notable quantity
of a body of a light yellow colour, and easily soluble in water, which he
calls uroranthine.   When urine containing this body is exposed to oxidi
zing agencies, such as nitric acid, or even atmospheric air, it deposits 8. dark.
coloured sediment, consisting of a blue and a red colouring-matter, named
by him respectively urogluucine                      The former, after being
                                         and war/iodine.
puri<U+FB01>ed, appears in small groups of crystals of a dark-blue colour, which
are insoluble in water, as well as in cold alcohol and ether, but soluble in
boiling alcohol. Urorhodine, according to Heller, is formed by a lower de
gree of oxidation than uroglaucine.    It is easily soluble in cold alcohol or
ether, to which it communicates a splendid crimson colour, and is always
amorphous and apparently of a resinous nature.         Uroxauthine, the body
from which these colouring-matters    are derived, and which, according to
Heller, is itself probably derived from urea, is also contained in small
quantities in normal urine.  Braconuot’s cyanourine        in Heller’s opinion,
                                                               is,
a mixture of uroglaucine and urorhodine.          two subsequent memoirs‘l'

colouring-matters    from urine, and on their occurrence in a urinary calculus,

ing their chemical        or physical properties.  The experiments of Alois
Martin   ‘,   the results of which w‘ere made known soon after those of Heller,
led to the same conclusion, viz., that in some diseases the urine on being
mixed with mineral acids deposits in considerable quantity :1 dark-coloured
sediment, consisting of two colouring-matters, one of which is blue, the
other red.    Regarding the former, which he calls urokyam'ne, Martin
states that it is insoluble in water and caustic alkalies, but soluble in alco~
hol and ether, that it is dissolved by concentrated sulphuric acid, the solu
tion becoming blue on dilution with water, and that when heated it yields
violet-coloured fumes like those of iodine.     Although these observations,
however incomplete,                    correct, very little importance was
                             were no doubt
attached      to themby chemists  in general, and their accuracy was even
questioned by some.     Berzelius characterizes Heller’s statements as un—
certain and unsatisfactory.    Lehmann says, “ Heller's experimeiits were
so incomplete that the very existence of such pigments as uroxanthine and
urorhodine is still doubtful." Golding Bird was of opinion that Heller had
described     as crystals   of   uroglaucine   uric acid merely tinted by the changed
colouring-matter, and he adds, “This error is an important one, and
throws much doubt on many of his conclusions.”           When a few very
simple experiments would have suf<U+FB01>ced to prove the accuracy of the obser
vations referred to, or to have shown in what respect they were erroneous,
such criticisms     as these can  hardly be considered fair; and I think that
Heller’s claims     as the discovererof the arti<U+FB01>cial formation from urine of a
blue and a     red colouring-matter  of de<U+FB01>nite character cannot be contested.
Golding Bird certainly claims to have been the <U+FB01>rst to observe the forma
tion of a red or pink colouring-matter, supposed by him to be identical
with that of the so-called pink deposits, by the action of hydrochloric acid
on healthy urine; but, without deciding the question of priority, I will
merely remark that his experiments must have been of a super<U+FB01>cial
character, or the simultaneous formation of a blue colouring-matter would
hardly have escaped his notice.  On the other hand, when it is considered
that the blue pigment occasionally deposited from urine had, as mentioned
above, been proved to be indigo-blue by several of the earlier observers,
and that at the time when Heller and Martin gave an account of their
experiments the properties and products of decomposition of this colouring
matter were well known,          surprising that these chemists should not
                                   it_   is
have suspected the identity of uroglaucine, urokyanine, and indigo-blue.
A  few comparative experiments would have proved their identity, and have
thus led to the discovery of one of the most important and interesting
facts connected with the chemistry of this subject.      How far Heller was
from understanding the true nature of his blue colouring-matter will be
seen by the following extract from his last memoir.          He says,         “If   a
pale yellow urine, rich in uroxanthine, either originally alkaline or alkaline
through standing, be kept in a well-corked <U+FB02>ask. the violet-coloured sub

<U+FB02>ask,    while  still closed,   be  shaken,    scarcely any change    of  colour  takes
place; but if it be shaken after the stopper has been removed and air ad
mitted,    the urine becomes, by shaking           with the air, more or less green,
often very beautifully grass-green. On standing it again becomes pale, and
these appearances may be repeated at pleasure with urine that has been
kept for months in a <U+FB02>ask.               This phenomenon, viz., that a strongly
alkaline urine containing the mixture of colouring-matters               only becomes
green by contact with air and not as long as the vessel is closed, is one the
cause of which I have not as yet been able to ascertain.”                      Any one
acquainted with the properties         of  indigo-blue   would, however,   have under
stood the matter at once.          By the combined action of the alkali and the
deoxidizjng     matters contained      in the urine, the indigo-blue in Heller's ex
periment      was  reduced   and    dissolved,   forming a true indigo-vat, and on
 admitting air it was reoxidiZed        and  precipitated, to be dissolved again when
 the vessel was closed.       Several years later H. v. Sicherer" obtained from
 a specimen of morbid urine, by the action of strong acids, a blue deposit,
 the properties of which he found to be those of indigo-blue.
    Heller’s experiments were followed, after an interval of some years, by
 those of Hassall'l", who observed the formation of a blue colouring-matter
 on allowing urine from disease to stand for some time exposed to the air.
 The colouring-matter was mixed with phosphates, mucus, and other im
 purities ; but after the latter had been, as far as possible, removed, it was
 found to consist of indigo-blue.            Hassall inferred from his experiments
 that the occurrence of this substance in the urine is strictly pathological.
 “ \Ve should be led,” he
                                says,
                                        “ to look for its occurrence in the urine in
 all those cases of functional derangement of any kind in which any impedi
 ment exists to decarbonization, as is the case especially in most diseases of
 the organs of respiration. . . . . It does not appear that, by any treatment
  of the urine with reagents, indigo can be developed in healthy urine at will.
  I have made several attempts with this view, but without obtaining any
  de<U+FB01>nite result.”      This opinion proved, however, to be erroneous.
     This subject was next taken up by myselfI. My experiments on the
  formation of indigo-blue in plants yielding that colouring-matter led to the
  conclusion that these plants contain a peculiar substance, belonging to the
  class of glucosides, which       I  named imlican. -As this substance is easily
  soluble in water, alcohol, and ether, and yields, by decomposition with
  acids, indigo-blue    and sugar, I thought it probable that the formation of
  indigo-blue   in urine might be due to the presence of a similar body in the
  secretion.    This supposition was found to be correct.            Not being able to
  procure specimens of morbid urine such as would be likely to yield the
  colouring-matter,     I was compelled to employ healthy urine; but after de

also a black pulverulent body, which he found to be insoluble in water and
alcohol, but soluble in alkalies, forming with the latter dark-brown solu
tions, from which it was precipitated by acids in thick black <U+FB02>ocks. When
dry, it had ashining appearance resembling that of broken asphalt. Proust
called this the peculiar black substance from urine ; and after some specu.
lotions on its nature and origin, he says that probably at some future time
the relation, at present quite unknown, in which it stands to other bodies
will     be discovered.            On repeating Proust's experiments, Berzelius obtained
nearly the same                 results; but he was of opinion that these substances are
not contained as such in the urine, as Proust had supposed, but are formed
by the action of acids on the extractive matters of urine. In this opinion
I entirely concur.    Scharling’s“ oxide of omichmyle does not seem to me
to differ in any   of its properties from Proust’s resin; but as Scharling,
instead of evaporation, employed congelation as a means of concentrating
the urine, and then extracted                              his so-called oxide with ether, there seems
some reason for supposing that his substance may have preexisted in the
urine.  On examining the further details of his process, it will be found,
however, that he used boiling caustic lye for the purpose of purifying it;
and it need hardly be observed that no conclusion can be drawn regarding
the preexistence   of any organic compound which has passed through a
process of puri<U+FB01>cation involving the use of such an energetic agent as
caustic alkali.   In the course of his experiments on the constitution of
urine, Liebigf also obtained the resinous substance of Proust, and he found
it to possess in general the properties previously ascribed to it. The
results of this portion of his investigation were summed up in the follow
ing words       :-“
                From the preceding it follows that human urine contains, as
organic acids, uric acid and hippuric acid, and another nitrogenous sub
stance (most probably the colouring-matter       of urine) which, in contact
with air         only

                      is contact with  air that, as already observed by Gay
Lussac, the putrefaction of urine, accompanied          absorption of oxygen,  by
takes place), decomposed, yielding acetic acid and resin-like substance."
                      is                                                        a

account of some experiments  on these brown colouring-matters,     and the
phenomena attending their formation.     there stated that “ when muriatic
                                                                  I

when the heating     continued. When these <U+FB02>ocks are <U+FB01>ltered off, washed,
                                is
and dried, they form    compact dark-brown mass, from which cold alcohol

  however, in discovering two new facts, to which I attach some importance.
  The <U+FB01>rst is, that the composition of the brown pulverulent substance,
  which is little soluble in alcohol, stands in a de<U+FB01>nite relation to that of
  indigo-blue; the second, that the urine, after depositing these <U+FB02>ocks and
  being made alkaline, has acquired the property of reducing oxide of copper,
  from which it may be inferred that it contains glucose in solution.         As the
  analytical details which     led   to the   discovery of the <U+FB01>rst fact have not
  hitherto been published, I think this a <U+FB01>tting occasion for making them
'lmown.
     The brown pulverulent substance was prepared in the following manner:
  —Urine was mixed with hydrochloric acid and allowed to stand. The
  uric acid which was deposited was separated by <U+FB01>ltration, and the liquid
  was boiled for some time.        The black powder which separated during the
  boiling  was   <U+FB01>ltered off, washed    with water, dried, and treated with cold
  alcohol, which extracted the easily soluble resinous portion, thereby
  acquiring a brown colour. The portion left undissolved by the cold alcohol
  was dissolved in boiling alcohol to which a little ammonia was added. The
  brown solution was <U+FB01>ltered and mixed with an excess of hydrochloric acid,
  which produced a brown precipitate, the supernatant liquid remaining
   coloured. This precipitate was collected on a <U+FB01>lter, washed with cold
  alcohol until the acid and sal-ammoniac were removed, and dried.            It had
   then the appearance of a dull, black, amorphous mass, which yielded a
   brownish-black powder, strongly resembling some of the products of de
   composition of indican.     When heated in a crucible it gave 01? a smell like
   that of burning horn, and then burned without previously fusing, giving
   much charcoal, which disappeared without leaving any ash. I need not
   describe its other properties, as they are in no way characteristic or inter
   esting. Its composition, which is a matter of more importance, was deter
   mined by several analyses, the results of which are as follows :—
      I. 0'4305 grm., dried at 100° C. and burnt with oxide of copper and
   oxygen, gave 0'9720 grm. carbonic acid and 01985 grm. water.

formed   by the action of alkalies and oxgyen on indigo-blue; and though
there is not the least resemblance between the two bodies, still the identity
in composition seems to indicate the possibility of a common origin. Is it
not possible, it may be asked, that the substance in urine which produces
indigo-blue may be in part converted, by a process of oxidation, into some
other substance which yields, instead of indigo-blue, a body having the
composition of anthranilic acid,   e. of   substance which

different composition.   On this occasion  the  method of preparation was
somewhat different.             The urine was <U+FB01>rst mixed with acetate of lead                       as
long as   precipitate was produced.
          a                          To the <U+FB01>ltered liquid there was added
basic acetate of lead, which gave rise to   second precipitate.

<U+FB01>ltered off, washed with water, and treated with an excess of dilute sul

water, and then treated with boiling alcohol as long as anything was dis
solved.     The liquid, after being <U+FB01>ltered boiling hot, was evaporated, and
the residue was treated with          little cold alcohol, which left
                                           a                             brown               a

    These experiments render it probable that the ordinary brown colouring
matters formed by the action of acids on urine are in fact derivatives of in
digo-blue, however little their properties may resemble those of the latter.
                                                     I
In some experiments, an account of which presented a short time ago to
the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society *,                   I   obtained by the
direct action of alcohol, acetate of soda, and caustic soda on indigo-blue a
number of products,          several  of which     bear    a  striking       resemblance   to
uromelanine,      as the brown    pulverulent substance obtained            by the action of
acids on urine has been called, and which differ in their                   properties  from
indigo-blue quite as widely as that substance does. But                     into this part of
the subject I cannot enter further at present.
     The liquid <U+FB01>ltered from the insoluble matter formed                   by the action of
acids on urine      I found to possess the property, after being made alkaline, of
dissolving oxide of copper and converting it into suboxide on being boiled.
This reaction, which had never been previously observed, attributed to        I
the presence of glucose, which, together with the brown colouring-matters,
had been formed at the expense of the extractive matters. The correctness
 of this inference has been doubted, since the same reaction may be pro
 duced by other substances as well as glucose ; but whether it be correct or
not, the fact remains, that normal urine free from sugar acquires the pro
 perty of reducing oxide of copper as soon as it has been boiled with the ad
 dition of a strong acid.         The general conclusion to which I was led by
 these few experiments was, that there not only exists a great resemblance
 between indican and the extractive matters of urine, as proved by the simi
 larity of their products of decomposition, but that they are also very pro
 bably in some way closely related as regards their composition and general
 properties.      In giving an account of my views on this subject I used these
 words :-—-“ I think it is probable that the indigo-producing body will be
 found, as regards its formation and composition, to occupy a place between
 the substance of the tissues and the ordinary extractive matter of urine.”
 Though this may have appeared at the time when it was pronounced a
 hasty conclusion,      further research has only tended to con<U+FB01>rm it.
     III.  The colouring-matters occurring in normal urine, and to which the
 usual colour     of the  secretion is due, have been less frequently submitted to
 investigation     than those which     make their appearance only exceptionally,
 or in consequence       of some   arti<U+FB01>cial  process of decomposition.             This cir
 cumstance may easily be accounted for.              These substances are all amor
 phous and possess few characteristic properties ; hence their separation
 from the other constituents of urine is attended with great dif<U+FB01>culties, and
 has even been pronounced impossible.             They are also compounds of very
 little stability, as every one who has worked with them must have observed,
 so much so that mere evaporation of the urine seems to produce a complete
 change in their composition, as seen by the marked alteration of colour
 which takes place during the process.              Then it has been observed that

normal urine exhibits great diversity of tint without any corresponding dif
ference in its other properties, and hence it has been inferred that these
differences are of little physiological or pathological importance, and that
an investigation  of their cause would not be likely to lead to any useful
practical results.  Our knowledge of the properties and composition of
these substances is therefore extremely defective, and the most discordant
views prevail as to their true nature.
   Fourcroy and Vauquelin " were of opinion that the smell, colour, taste,
and great liability to decomposition of urine, in fact all its characteristic
properties, were due to. one constituent only, viz. urea. Itis evident, how
ever, that their urea must have been impure, since they obtained from it by
the action of caustic potash a brown fatty matter and acetic acid, products
which could only have been derived from the extractive matter and other
impurities with which it was contaminated.         It was afterwards shown by
Berzelius that urea is colourless, and possesses no remarkable smell nor
taste.   Proust, as mentioned above, attributed the colour, as well as the
bitter  taste and peculiar smell of urine, to his fallow resin.             Prout
thought that the colouring-matter of healthy urine was of two kinds, one of
them being capable of combining with urate of ammonia and importing to
it the usual tint of uric acid calculi, the other destitute of this property. To
Bcrzelius   the great observer who has enriched almost every department

be consulted with advantage, as      contains infoi'mation not to be found

elsewhere.            In   its main results  I    have found       it   remarkably    correct,   andI
shall have occasion to refer to    again.  Though Berzelius did not succeed
                                             it
in obtaining his substances in astute of complete purity and free from other
constituents of urine, such as urea and chlorides, he nevertheless ascertained
the existence of several distinct urinary extractive matters, which were dis
tinguished from one another                  by
                                their behaviour towards various solvents.
One of these he found to be soluble in absolute alcohol, the second was only
soluble in alcohol of sp. gr. 0833, while the third was insoluble in_ alcohol
of all strengths, and only soluble in water. He seems also to have obtained
a minute quantity of an extractive matter soluble in ether, the others being
insoluble in that menstruum.     The extractive matter soluble in absolute
alcohol he proposed to name halopllilc, in consequence of its power of com
bining with various neutral salts.According to Berzelius, these substances
bear   great resemblance to the extractive matters of <U+FB02>esh.

from the other constituents is worth mentioning.      He added an excess of
acid to urine, and the uric acid which separated on standing he treated with
boiling alcohol, which left the acid undissolved, and, after <U+FB01>ltration and
evaporation, gave a residue consisting of a reddish-brown extractive matter,
which had a bitter aromatic taste, and, when warmed, exhaled a urinous
odour. The colour of its watery solution was exactly like that of urine.
   In his elaborate memoir on urine, Lehmann * makes some remarks on
the properties of the extractive matter of urine and the best method of pre
paring it. For the purpose of obtaining it in a state of purity, hesubmitted
urine to congelation, and evaporated the concentrated liquid in vacuo, em
ploying afterwards alcohol and ether for the purpose of extracting it from
the residue.    No part of the process described by him would induce any
extensive decomposition of the substance under examination.      On the other
hand, it is very doubtful whether it was quite free from impurities, since he
attributes to the coloured extractive matter (<U+FB01>irbender Eztractivstq<U+FB02>‘) of
urine the property of inducing decomposition in urea, and consequently in
urine also—a property which it certainly does not possess when pure, how
ever liable it may itself be to decomposition.    The putrefaction of urine,
which manifests itself by the conversion of the urea into carbonate of am
monia, must be caused by some other body.        The extractive matter does
not act as a ferment, which may indeed be inferred from the very small
quantity of nitrogen contained in it. The disagreeable odour which the
watery solution of Lehmann’s substance began to exhale when exposed to
the air also points to some impurity.   Its acid reaction be attributes to an
admixture of lactic acid, which was generally supposed to be contained in
urine, until its entire absence was proved by the experiments of Liebig.
Lehmann’s observations regarding its other properties, as, for instance, the
changes of colour produced in its watery solution by various reagents, are,
however, remarkably           correct.
   Lehmann, as well as Berzelius, found the substance to which healthy.
urine owes its colour to be completely soluble in water.          Subsequently,
however, most of the attempts which were made            isolate the colouring
                                                                     _to

substance the colouring-matter of urine, though it must be evident to any
one reading his account that it was a product formed by the action of hy
drochloric acid on the extractive matter, and essentially the same as that
previously obtained by Proust.           Scherer submitted his substance to ana
lysis, and found its composition to vary exceedingly.              Hence it may be in
ferred that it consisted of a mixture of two or more substances. In my ex
periments on the brown colouring-matters            formed by the action of acids,   I
obtained, as mentioned above, bodies having the same external appearance
and general properties, but varying in composition.           The latter corresponded
on one occasion with the formula CH H, NO,; on another occasion the ana
lysis led to the formula C28 Hls NON.          Now, on calculating the composition
of a mixture of equal parts of the two bodies having respectively these
formulae, it will be found to agree tolerably well with the mean of the two
<U+FB01>rst analyses given by Scherer, as will be seen on comparing his numbers

     It does not appear that Scherer took the precaution of treating his pro
 duct with alcohol, in order to separate the easily soluble resinous matter
 which is always formed together with the pulvernlent body when the ex
 tractive matters are decomposed by acids.            Unless this precaution is taken,
 the product is sure to contain more than one substance, and its analysis
 must give very discordant results.           On one occasion Scherer obtained by
 the direct action of hydrochloric acid on urine a dark-blue powder, which
 when dry assumed a coppery lustre like indigo, and must, indeed, have been
 indigo-blue itself.     The formation of a blue colouring-matter by the action
 of acids on some constituent of urine had been observed by Heller only a
 short time previously.        Neither of these chemists, however, was aware of
 its true character, which was not discovered until long afterwards.
      Harley * succeeded in separating Scherer’s colouring-matter into several
  substances, to only one of which, in his opinion, the colour of ordinary
 ‘urine is to be attributed.      This, according to his description, is a resinous,
  amorphous body      of-a   <U+FB01>ne  red or brownish-red colour, insoluble in water,
  but easily soluble in alcohol, ether, and caustic alkalies, to which he gave
  the name of uroluematine.          On being incinerated it leaves a little oxide of
  iron, and hence Harley infers that it is allied to the haematine of blood, of
  which it is perhaps only a modi<U+FB01>cation.           By a process similar to that em
  ployed by Harley, Marcet        f  obtained from urine a resinous rose-coloured

substance, having an acid reaction, insoluble in water, but soluble in alcohol,
and which he supposed must exist in the secretion in a free state.       I have
no doubt, however, that this and all similar bodies are products of decom
position derived from the extractive matters or the indigo—producing sub
stance of the urine. They do not preexist in the secretion, but are formed
during the process of preparation by the action of the reagents employed.
Even a prolonged heating at 100° C. is quite suf<U+FB01>cient, as I shall hereafter
show, to produce a complete decomposition of the extractive matters, and
their conversion into products of an entirely different nature, consisting in
great part of brown resinous substances insoluble in water.
   The investigations touching this subject which remain to he noticed are
few in number. N otwithstanding its importance from a physiological point
of view, the difficulties connected with    and the uncertainty of the con

clusions to which most previous researches had led, probably deterred many
from entering on its investigation.      Tichborne‘s account of the normal
                                                                 "'
urinary pigment    differs from those of some of his predecessors. According
to him the colouring-matter     of normal urine       brown, amorphous sub
                                                            is   a
stance, which   is  vcry hygroscopic, easily soluble in water, less soluble in
alcohol, and insoluble in ether.    The colour of its watery solution cannot
be distinguished from that of ordinary urine, and by making           more or          it
less dilute, the several tints of normal urine may be imitated.     Tichborne
has given the results of its analysis, which    probably the <U+FB01>rst ever made

                                                 myself, and lead to acom
position more nearly approaching that of the brown colouring-matters
insoluble in water so often obtained in previous experiments.    The hypo
thesis which he has ventured to set up, viz. that this substance    derived                is
in some way from hippuric acid,           is,

Indeed there are more reasons in favour of the converse hypothesis, viz.
that the urinary extractive matters are the source, or at least one source, of
hippuric acid.     The existence in urine of more than one kind of extractive
matter seems    to have escaped the notice of this observer.
   By far the most complete investigation of the colouring-matters of normal
urine  isthat of Dr. Thudichum       T.The results of this investigation having
quite recently   been  made  known,   I need not enter at present into any of
the details.   In  giving an account  of my own experiments,       shall have oc   I
casion to show that my results differ in many respects from those of Dr.
Thudichum.    I   cannot, however, even now refrain from expressing my sur
prise that, notwithstanding   the numerous observations and experiments of
chemists  on the  blue and  red colouring-matters from urine, he should have
                                 “

neither indigo-red nor indigo-blue  by boiling with acids.”  This result,
however, may easily be accounted for by any one conversant with the
subject who attentively considers the details of his process.      The indigo
producing body of urine, if it be not identical with indican, is certainly quite
as susceptible of change as the latter; and the small quantity existing in
the secretion may easily disappear under the in<U+FB02>uence of heat, alkalies, or

basis on which to found further research.
    In order to arrive at a positive conclusion on this point, the readiest
means was, as it seemed to me, to ascertain the exact composition of the
extractive    matters obtained    at different times from various sources; for,
being neutral uncrystallizable bodies, it was evident that a mere examination
of their chemical and physical properties would lead to no certain result.
This portion of    the investigation has occupied me for some time, commen
cing   in the  year 1856, and will form the subject of the present communica
tion.     The successive series of experiments which were made will be
distinguished by letters with the respective dates attached.

                                                                     I
    In this, as well as in the subsequent seriesof experiments, made use of
neutral and basic acetate of lead for the purpose of separating the extractive
matters from the other constituents of urine, the same means having pre
viously been employed with this view by Scherer. Having taken a quantity
 of ordinary urine, I added to it a solution of acetate of lead, which produced
 a copious precipitate,   consisting of sulphate, phosphate, chloride, and urate
 of lead, together with lead compounds of extractive matter. This precipi
tate was <U+FB01>ltered off and thrown away.          In the <U+FB01>ltered liquid, which was
lighter in colour than the original urine, basic acetate of lead produced a
 second precipitate as abundant as the <U+FB01>rst, and consisting principally of
lead compounds of the extractive matters mixed with basic chloride of lead.
This precipitate, after being well washed with water, was treated with an
excess of cold dilute sulphuric acid, with which it was allowed to remain in
contact for some time.      The extractive matter set at liberty by the acid
communicated      to the liquid a brown colour, a peculiar urinous odour being
at the same time evolved.        The excess of acid was removed by adding car
bonate     of lead, and stirring the mixture well in a mortar.             After all
efl‘crvescence had ceased, the liquid, which was now of a <U+FB01>ne yellow colour
like urine itself, was <U+FB01>ltered and evaporated; but in order to avoid any
 decomposition which might have been caused by the application of arti<U+FB01>cial
 heat, the evaporation was conducted at the ordinary temperature by means
 of a current of air in the apparatus formerly employed in the preparation
 of indican *. After evaporation there was left a thick brown syrup, which
was poured into a <U+FB02>ask and treated with cold alcohol, with which, after
being well shaken, it was left to stand for some time.         The alcohol left a
portion of this syrup undissolved as a brown glutinous mass (a).                   The
liquid, which had a deep yellow colour, was poured off, and there was added
 to it an alcoholic solution of acetate of lead, which produced a cream

liquid from the precipitate (b), and then added more of the lead solution,
which produced a precipitate of a pure cream-colour (c). - This was <U+FB01>ltered
off, washed with alcohol, dried in vacuo, and submitted to analysis.              It
contained, like many of the lead compounds subsequently analyzed, chloride
of lead, which had to be estimated.            By attempting to remove all the
hydrochloric acid from the solution of extractive matter before precipitation,
I ran the risk of producing decomposition in the organic substance.

    No importance is to be attached to this formula, which is merely an em
pirical expression for the composition of the substance, or mixture of sub
 stances, prepared in the manner described.          As a guide to further experi
ments, the analysis was, however, not without use.                 The very small
proportion of nitrogen obtained showed that the substance was probably
free from the urinary constituents containing much of that element, and
that the lead compound contained extractive matter only ; but whether the
 latter consisted of only one substance or of several was doubtful, as the
 method of preparation afforded no guarantee for its purity.
    The lead precipitate (b), which, it was to be presumed, had the same
 composition   as the one analyzed, was now examined.          It  was suspended in

water and decomposed with sulphuretted hydrogen, and the <U+FB01>ltered liquid
was evaporated by means of a current of air in the apparatus above referred
to.     During evaporation some white crystals were deposited, consisting
probably of a product of decomposition formed by the action of the free
hydrochloric acid on the extractive matter. These were <U+FB01>ltered off, and
the liquor was evaporated as before to a syrup, which was treated with cold
alcohol.       The alcoholic solution, after being <U+FB01>ltered from some white
crystals which were left undissolved, was evaporated to a syrup, which, after
being mixed with a little alcohol for the sake of dilution, was poured into
a <U+FB02>ask and agitated with successive doses of ether as long as anything was
taken up by the latter. The residue left undissolved by the ether (d), after
the ethereal liquid (e) had been poured off, was treated with cold alcohol,
which dissolved the whole with the exception of some white crystals *.
The <U+FB01>ltered liquid was mixed with acetic acid and then with‘acetate-of-lead
solution, and the brown precipitate caused by the latter having been <U+FB01>ltered
off, there was added to it a small quantity of ammonia, which produced a
cream-coloured precipitate.            This precipitate was <U+FB01>ltered off, washed with
alcohol, dried in vacuo, and employed for the following analysis :—

    * These crystals consisted probably of the same substance as those deposited during
 the evaporation of the watery solution <U+FB01>ltered from the sulphide of lead. They con
 tained, besides organic matter, a quantity of sulphates of earthy bases.     The latter were
 removed    by dissolving the whole in water and adding an excess of caustic baryta.
 Alter passing carbonic acid through the <U+FB01>ltered liquid, evaporating to dryness, treating
 the residue with boiling water, <U+FB01>ltering, and again evaporating to dryness, a white crys—
 talline mass was obtained, which was free from all inorganic impurities.       A few of the
 properties of this substance may be mentioned, though they are not sutlicient to identify
 it. When heated on platinum-foil it melted and then burned, leaving much charcoal,
 which, however, disappeared entirely on being further heated.         On being heated ’in a
 tube, it gave a little crystalline sublimate. It dissolved with di<U+FB02>lculty in boiling alcohol,
 and the solution, on cooling, deposited some transparent, prismatic crystals.            The
 watery solution remained unchanged on the addition of acetate of lead, but on adding
 ammonia there was an abundant white precipitate. On mixing the watery solution with
 a salt of copper and an excess of caustic soda it tamed blue, but remained unchanged on
 being boiled.

    This analysis, though, like the <U+FB01>rst, of little value in itself, seems to
point to the conclusion that the extractive matter has a tendency to undergo
a change, which consists in the absorption of water, and which is probably
promoted by the action of strong acids.         There is, however, another way
of explaining its results, which will be given when       I  come to review the
whole of the analytical data.
    A portion of the alcoholic solution from which this lead compound was
precipitated was evaporated, when it left a brown syrup, some of the pro
perties of which are not without interest.         \Vhen heated in a crucible it
began to boil, evolved acid    fumes,  consisting partly of hydrochloric acid,
and left after combustion much charcoal, which burnt away, leaving a little
white ash.     The watery solution was strongly acid.         After being mixed
with a solution of oxide of copper and“ an excess of caustic alkali it became
green, and, on being boiled, the liquid deposited suboxide of copper; but
 this reaction was probably due to an admixture of some impurity or of some
product of decomposition. On adding to the alcoholic solution an alcoholic
 solution of acetate of lead, a cream-coloured precipitate fell, which, after
 being <U+FB01>ltered off and washed with alcohol, was treated with dilute sulphuric
 acid.   The <U+FB01>ltered liquid, after being made alkaline, did not reduce oxide
 of copper; but, on the other hand, the liquid <U+FB01>ltered from the cream
 coloured precipitate gave with ammonia awhite precipitate, which, on being
 treated in the same way as the other, was found to contain, in combination
 with oxide of lead, a substance which, in conjunction with caustic alkali,
 readily reduced the oxide.     The lead compound, the analysis of which has
  ‘ust been given, may indeed, as I shall show further on, have consisted of
 a mixture of equal parts of two lead compounds, viz. of the compound of
 an extractive matter and of that of another body having the composition
 of glucose.   The watery solution of the syrup, on being mixed with hydro
 chloric acid and boiled, became brown, and deposited dark brown <U+FB02>ocks.
 The <U+FB01>ltered liquid left on evaporation a residue, which, on being treated
 with water, dissolved only in part, an additional quantity of brown <U+FB02>ocks
 being left undissolved.    These <U+FB02>ocks were very little soluble in boiling al-  -
 cohol, but they dissolved readily in a mixture of alcohol and ammonia.
 The liquid <U+FB01>ltered from the <U+FB02>ocks left on evaporation a yellow syrup mixed
 with a quantity of needle-shaped crystals arranged in star-shaped masses.

 On being dried, the syrup became hard, but deliquesced again on exposure
 to the air.
    The ethereal liquid (e) containing in solution that portion of the extractive
 matter of the lead precipitate (b)soluble in ether, was agitated with carbonate
 of lead, by which means the hydrochloric acid contained in it was entirely
 removed.       To the <U+FB01>ltered liquid there was added an alcoholic solution of
 acetate of lead, which produced a cream-coloured precipitate.            This was
 <U+FB01>ltered   off,  washed  with cold  alcohol,  dried in vacuo, and analyzed, the re

    In  the case of a compound like this, having such a high atomic weight,
several formnlro may of course be calculated, each of which may give a
theoretical     composition agreeing as well as the above with that found by
experiment.        My reasons for adopting the one just given will be stated
further   on.
    A portion of the liquid from which this compound was precipitated
with acetate of lead was evaporated, when it left a brown syrup closely
resembling that obtained from the liquid from which the lead compound
of the second analysis was precipitated.            When heated in a crucible it
gave of? copious fumes, and left off much charcoal, which, however, burnt
away, leaving only a trace of ash. Its watery solution had a strongly acid
reaction, though it was quite free from hydrochloric acid.            When treated
with boiling caustic soda lye it evolved ammonia.             The watery solution,
on the addition of a salt of copper and an excess of caustic alkali, became
green, and the <U+FB01>ltered liquid, on being boiled, deposited an abundance of

 96                  Mr. E. Schunck        on {he Colouring    and           [Recess,
 suboxide of copper.          This reaction was, however, due to some substance
 accompanying the extractive matter.             On adding to the alcoholic solution
 of the syrup an alcoholic solution of acetate of lead, a cream-coloured pre
 cipitate was produced which contained none of this substance; but on
 adding ammonia to the iiltered liquid, a white precipitate fell in which it
 was contained in combination with oxide of lead.               The lead compound
 analyzed     was therefore free from this impurity, and probably contained
 merely    the    urinary extractive matter soluble in alcohol and ether. The
 watery solution of the syrup, on being mixed with hydrochloric acid and
 boiled, became darker in colour, and then deposited dark brown resin-like
 masses,    which remained in a state of       fusion as long as the liquid was kept
 boiling.      The <U+FB01>ltered liquid left on       evaporation a syrupy residue, which
was only partly soluble in water, a            quantity of the resin—like substance
being left undissolved.         The solution,   after being again <U+FB01>ltered and evapo
rated,    left  a  brown   syrup   <U+FB01>lled  with   crystalline needles.    Cold
                                                                               alcohol
dissolved the greatest part of this residue, leaving only              the crystalline
needles undissolved.          The resinous substance, after being well washed
with water, was treated with cold alcohol, in which it was entirely soluble,
forming a brown solution which, on evaporation, left a brown, shining,
brittle residue.       The extractive matter contained in this compound di<U+FB01>‘ers
therefore from that of the lead compound previously analyzed, not only by
its solubility in ether, but also by its yielding with acids products of de
                                                                                      ’
composition of a different kind.
    The alcoholic liquid <U+FB01>ltered from the lead precipitate (b) was mixed
with more acetate of lead and some ammonia, with which it gave a bulky
cream-coloured        precipitate.     This was <U+FB01>ltered off, washed with water,
then    suspended      in  water,  and decomposed with sulphuretted hydrogen.
The <U+FB01>ltered liquid was evaporated, as before describedLby means of a
current of air, and the yellow syrup left on evaporation was poured into a
<U+FB02>ask and agitated with alcohol, which dissolved the whole of it with the
exception of a slight residue, consisting of a glutinous substance mixed
with some white crystals.           The. <U+FB01>ltered liquid was evaporated, and the
residue left was agitated with ether.             The ether having been poured off,
the insoluble portion was treated with cold alcohol, which dissolved almost
the whole of it.        The solution was mixed with a little alcoholic solution
of   acetate    of lead, and the precipitate thereby produced having been
<U+FB01>ltered off, more acetate of lead was added, which gave a precipitate of a
pure cream-colour.         This was <U+FB01>ltered off, washed with alcohol, dried in
vacuo, and analyzed, the following results being obtained :—

   Though the substance combined in this case with the oxide and chloride
of lead was without doubt a mixture, still I think it may be of use to
devise some formula which shall express its composition, and thus lead to
some plausible conjecture as to its constituents.               The relatively large
quantity of oxygen contained in it makes this rather difficult; but, as            I
shall presently show, one of the urinary extractive matters is richer in
oxygen than the others, and by assuming that the substance in this case
was a mixture of equal parts of this extractive matter and glucose, I arrive at
the formula C” Ha9 NO ll, which requires

   The liquid <U+FB01>ltered from this lead compound did in fact contain a sub

      The brown       glutinous mass (a) which was left undissolved by cold
 alcohol    was    treated   with cold water, and the liquid, after being <U+FB01>ltered
 from the insoluble matter (f), which consisted for the most part of chloride
 of lead, was evaporated           as usual by means of a current of air.          During
 evaporation some more chloride of lead was deposited, which was sepa
 rated, and there was left at last a thin syrup, which was poured into a
<U+FB02>ask and agitated with alcohol.                The alcohol converted it into a milky
emulsion,      which, after standing some time, deposited a brown glutinous
substance, the supernatant liquid becoming clear.                The latter having been
poured      off,  the   deposit    was  dissolved   in   cold water,   and to the solution
there was added acetate of lead and suf<U+FB01>cient                ammonia to cause a slightly
alkaline     reaction.     The precipitate (g)      which was thereby produced was
<U+FB01>ltered o<U+FB01>‘, washed with water, and, after being suspended in water, decom
posed with sulphuretted hydrogen.                The liquid <U+FB01>ltered from the sulphide
of lead was evaporated in the air-current, when it left a brown syrup,
which was treated with alcohol.             The alcoholic liquid, after being <U+FB01>ltered
from some insoluble matter, consisting of crystals mixed with a little glu
tinous substance, was evaporated as before to a syrup, and this syrup was
poured into a <U+FB02>ask and agitated with successive portions of ether until
nothing more was dissolved.            The ethereal solution (/1) having been poured
oil“,   the insoluble     matter was treated with cold alcohol, which dissolved
almost the whole of it.            To the <U+FB01>ltered liquid there        was   added a little
alcoholic     solution of acetate of lead      ; and the precipitate thereby produced
having     been <U+FB01>ltered       off,  more lead solution was added, which gave a
copious precipitate (i) of a greyish cream-colour. This, after being <U+FB01>ltered
o<U+FB01>' and treated in the same manner as the other lead precipitates, was
analyzed, the results obtained being as follows :—
     V. 1-3455 grm. gave 0-8455 grm. carbonic acid and 0-2830 grm. water.
      1'5710 grm. gave 0'2490 grm. chloride of platinum and ammonium.

      It   may excite some surprise that the extractive matter contained in this
compound,       which was soluble in alcohol, should have been obtained from
the brown        glutinous(a), which was insoluble
                                    massv                                        in alcohol, and had
quite the appearance of an extractive matter itself.                              This may, however,
be easily explained, since the mass (11) contained lead, being, indeed, merely
a lead compound of the extractive matter soluble in alcohol, and many of the
compounds of the latter with bases are insoluble in alcohol.  It    in fact,                  is,
still doubtful whether urine does contain an extractive matter insoluble in
alcohol, and whether the various substances having this character, ob
tained in these and previous experiments, are not compounds of extractive
matters with bases   but to this point

This was <U+FB01>ltered o<U+FB01>“, washed with water, then suspended in water, and

oxide of mercury, together with some metallic mercury, the whole being
frequently shaken.       By this means the hydrochloric acid contained in it
was completely removed, after which the liquid was <U+FB01>ltered and evaporated.
The residue was treated with water, which left a little yellowish powder
undissolved. Through the <U+FB01>ltered liquid sulphuretted hydrogen was passed
in order to precipitate the mercury in solution, and after being again
<U+FB01>ltered it was evaporated, when it left a pale yellow syrup.            This was
treated with alcohol, which dissolved almost the whole of it.             To the
<U+FB01>ltered alcoholic solution there was added a solution of acetate of lead,
which produced an almost white precipitate.            This was <U+FB01>ltered off and
prepared as usual for analysis.

  clearness to pass them all under review together.
     The insoluble matter (f), consisting chie<U+FB02>y of chloride of lead, still re

  with cold dilute sulphuric acid.      The liquid <U+FB01>ltered from the sulphate of
  lead was mixed with an excess of baryta-water, which produced a brown
  precipitate consisting of sulphate of baryta mixed with some compound of
  extractive matter.     To  the <U+FB01>ltered   liquid there was added    a slight  excess
  of acetic  acid, and then acetate of lead and su<U+FB02>icient      ammonia to neutralize

      To  the liquid <U+FB01>ltered from the lead precipitate (i), which was employed
  for the preparation of the last compound, there was added more acetate of
  lead and an excess    of ammonia.      The bulky precipitate thereby produced

 chloride of mercury contained in it was converted into subchloride, and
 the liquid was rendered free from chlorine.           The <U+FB01>ltered liquid, which
 was almost colourless, was evaporated in the usual manner by means of
 an air-current,    until its volume was considerably diminished.         During
 evaporation a little white matter was deposited which was <U+FB01>ltered 06'.
 The mercury contained in the solution was removed by means of sul
 phuretted hydrogen, and after being <U+FB01>ltered it was evaporated as before
 to a syrup.     This syrup was found to be insoluble in cold alcohol.     It was
 therefore dissolved in a little water.     To the solution there was added a
 little acetate of lead, which gave a slight precipitate, and this having been
 <U+FB01>ltered off, the liquid was mixed with alcohol until no more precipitate was
 produced.      This precipitate, which was white, was <U+FB01>ltered off, washed with
 alcohol, and dried in vacuo.        On being analyzed it yielded the following

    The two last analyses will suf<U+FB01>ce to show that the chloride of lead depo
 sited during the evaporation of the liquid obtained from the precipitate,
 which basic acetate of lead produces in urine after the. addition of neutral
acetate, takes down with it a portion of the extractive matter, and that the
composition of this portion is similar to that of the rest which is retained
in solution.
    This series of experiments leads to the conclusion that the precipitate
 produced in urine by basic acetate of lead contains, in combination with
oxide and chloride of lead, at least two extractive matters, one of which is
soluble in alcohol and ether, the other soluble in alcohol only, but very
 similar to one another in all other respects; and that it also a<U+FB01>'ords a sub
 stance which has the composition and some of the properties of glucose,
 this being probably a product derived from one or both of the extractive
matters, and not preexisting       in the urine or even in the lead precipitate
itself.

   Having by the previous experiments determined in a general way the
composition of the precipitate produced in urine by basic acetate of lead,       I
now resolved to ascertain whether the precipitate with neutral acetate of
lead contains any urinary extractive matter in addition to the sulphate,
phosphate,   chloride, and urate of lead, of which it chie<U+FB02>y consists.         For
this purpose acetate of lead was added to urine, and the precipitate thereby
produced was washed with water and then treated with an excess of dilute
sulphuric acid, with which it'was left to stand for some time.         To the <U+FB01>l
tered liquid, which had a deep yellow colour, there was added suf<U+FB01>cient
baryta-water to remove the sulphuric acid, and then an excess of milk of
lime, which gave a gelatinous precipitate consisting chie<U+FB02>y of phosphate of
lime.    The liquid, which had now lost much of its colour, was <U+FB01>ltered and
made acid with acetic acid.        Acetate of lead now produced no precipitate
but on the addition of ammonia a cream-coloured precipitate fell, which
after being washed was treated with dilute sulphuric acid.          The excess of
acid was removed by means of carbonate of lead, and the <U+FB01>ltered liquid
was evaporated in the usual manner in a current of air to a syrup.            This
syrup was dissolved in cold alcohol, and to the solution there was added
an alcoholic solution of acetate of lead.      The precipitate thereby produced
was <U+FB01>ltered o<U+FB01>', washed with alcohol, and then treated with dilute sulphuric
acid.    The excess of the latter having been removed as before by means of
carbonate of lead, the <U+FB01>ltered liquid was evaporated.          The residue which
was left was treated with cold alcohol, and the alcoholic solution, after
being <U+FB01>ltered, was mixed with twice its volume“ of ether, which caused it
to become milky.      After some time a glutinous deposit settled at the bot
tom of the vessel, leaving a supernatant liquid, which was bright yellow and
clear.    To this liquid there was added an alcoholic solution of acetate of
lead, which produced a cream-coloured precipitate.           This was <U+FB01>ltered o<U+FB02>',
washed with alcohol, dried in vacuo, and analyzed as usual, the results
being as follows   :—
   I.  0'9805 grm. gave 0-8425 grm. carbonic acid and 0-2320 grm. water.
   1'1795 grm. gave 0'1850 grm. chloride of platinum and ammonium.

    This formula. differs, as will be seen, only by three atoms of water from
that to which the <U+FB01>rst analysis of the preceding series led, though, like the
latter, it does not represent a pure unmixed substance.            It may therefore
be inferred that the precipitate produced in urine by neutral acetate of lead
contains the same extractive matters as the precipitate which basic acetate
of lead gives in the <U+FB01>ltrate.    This conclusion was con<U+FB01>rmed in       a very satis
factory manner by subsequent experiments.
                                     C (1857 .
   The facility with which the hydrochloric acid derived from the chloride
of sodium of the urine is removed from solutions of urinary extractive
matters containing the acid, by means of oxide of mercury and metallic
mercury, led me to try this method of puri<U+FB01>cation on a somewhat larger
scale than before.     For this purpose a quantity of urine was mixed with
acetate of lead, and to the liquid <U+FB01>ltered from the precipitate basic acetate
of lead was added, which produced, as usual, a second precipitate.            This
precipitate was <U+FB01>ltered off, washed, and treated with dilute sulphuric acid.
The excess of acid having been removed by means of carbonate of lead, the
<U+FB01>ltered liquid was evaporated in the air-current.        The residue left on eva
poration was treated with cold     water,   which left undissolved a mixture or
compound of chloride of lead and extractive matter.          This was <U+FB01>ltered off,
and the lead still contained in solution was precipitated by a current of
sulphuretted hydrogen.       The <U+FB01>ltered liquid containing hydrochloric acid
was now agitated with freshly precipitated oxide of mercury, to which some
metallic mercury was added. As soon as it had become free from chlorine,
it was again <U+FB01>ltered and evaporated in the air-current. The glutinous
residue left on evaporation was treated with cold alcohol, in which only a
trace dissolved.    That which was left undissolved by the alcohol was now
dissolved in water, and through the solution, which contained an abundance
of mercury, a current of sulphuretted hydrogen was passed, and the <U+FB01>ltered
liquid  was evaporated.    The residue   was treated  with cold alcohol.    A pale
yellow glutinous substance was left undissolved, which was dissolved in
water.    The watery solution was mixed with ammonia, with which it gave
a <U+FB01>occulent precipitate.     To the <U+FB01>ltered liquid there was added acetate of
lead, and the precipitate    thereby   produced was <U+FB01>ltered      off, washed, and

      It will be seen that the Analyses VII. and IX. of Series A, which were
 made with compounds prepared in the same manner as this, led to almost
 the same composition.            It must not be inferred from this that these were
 all compounds of a pure substance with oxide of lead.                  It is more probable
 that the oxide of mercury employed in their preparation had simply the
 effect of removing certain substances from the solution with which it was
 brought into contact, leaving a mixture of others, the quantities of which
 stood in a certain unvarying ratio to one another.                That the above formula
 represents a mixture containing glucose is very probable, as                  I shall after
 wards show; and, on the other hand, it is certain that a great part of the
 extractive matters entered into combination with the oxide of mercury, as
 the solutions, after being shaken up with the oxide, became several shades
 lighter in colour.       It is also not improbable that oxide of mercury causes
 the extractive matters to undergo a certain degree of oxidation—a conclusion
 to which the large percentage of oxygen yielded by the analysis just given,
 as well as the two others, seems to point.               In my subsequent experiments
 I therefore ceased to employ oxide of mercury except as a means of puri
fying the extractive matter insoluble in ether and alcohol.
     The mixture or compound of chloride of lead and extractive matter ob
tained as usual in this experiment was employed for the preparation of a
compound containing           less chloride of lead, the proecss‘ being the same as

    The lead compounds next analyzed were procured from the same source
as those    of Series A. Urine was mixed with a solution of acetate of lead
aslong as a precipitate was produced, and to the <U+FB01>ltered liquid basic ace
tate of lead was added, which gave, as usual, an abundant precipitate.
This was allowed to settle, washed, <U+FB01>ltered o<U+FB01>‘, and then treated with cold
 dilute sulphuric acid.     The excess of the latter having been removed by
 means of carbonate of lead, the <U+FB01>ltered liquid was evaporated in the usual
manner by means of a current of air.           The syrup which was left behind
was dissolved in a little water, and the solution was mixed with a large
 quantity of alcohol.     To the <U+FB01>ltered liquid there was added an alcoholic
 solution of acetate of lead and some ammonia.           The precipitate thereby
produced was <U+FB01>ltered off, washed with        alcohol, and then treated with dilute
sulphuric acid.      The excess of acid having been removed with carbonate
of lead, the <U+FB01>ltered liquid was evaporated in the usual manner to a syrup.
This syrup was poured into a <U+FB02>ask together with a little alcohol, and a large
quantity of ether was then added, which caused the separation of a glutinous
substance that was slowly deposited at the bottom of the vessel.             After
the ethereal solution had become clear, it was poured off from the glutinous
deposit (a) and evaporated, and the residue was treated with water, which
left a little fatty matter undissolved.       The <U+FB01>ltered liquid was evaporated
in the usual manner to a syrup, which was dissolved in alcohol.             On the
addition of acetate of lead and a little ammonia to this solution, a cream
coloured precipitate fell, which was <U+FB01>ltered o<U+FB01>', washed with alcohol, dried
in mono, and analyzed.         It contained no traée of chloride of lead.

which was expressed by the formula Cw H30 N 0,0. It may also be remarked
as a singular circumstance, that the quantity of oxide of lead found in the
                                                                                           '
present analysis is equal to the sum of the oxide of lead and chloride of
lead (52'26+8'40) of the former.              Hence it may be inferred that in these
compounds        the  chloride   of lead   and    oxide of lead replace one another
weight for weight, and not according to their respective equivalents.                The
same circumstance           occurred on several other occasions *, otherwise it
might have been attributed to mere accident.
     The glutinous substance (11), insoluble in the mixture of alcohol and ether,
was treated with water.           The liquid, after being <U+FB01>ltered from some undis~
 solved matter, consisting chie<U+FB02>y of chloride of lead, was mixed with a solu
tion of acetate of lead and a large quantity of alcohol, which produced a
cream-coloured precipitate.          This was <U+FB01>ltered off, and after being treated
in   the usual manner, submitted to analysis, the results being as follows :—

      After having added to urine an excess, <U+FB01>rst of acetate and then of basic
  acetate of lead, the liquid is found to have lost the greatest part of its
  colour. Nevertheless it preduces with ammonia a bulky precipitate, which
  is similar in appearance to the two other lead precipitates, and also con
  tains some extractive matter.      The object of this series of experiments was
  to ascertain whether the composition of this portion of extractive matter is
  the same as that of the portion contained in the two other precipitates.
  A quantity of urine was accordingly mixed with acetate of lead, and then
  with basic acetate of lead, until the latter gave no more precipitate.      After
  the liquid had become clear, it was decanted and mixed with an excess of
  ammonia.      The precipitate thereby produced was allowed to settle, <U+FB01>ltered
  off, completely washed, and then treated with dilute sulphuric acid in the
  cold.    The excess of the latter was removed by means of carbonate of lead,
  and the <U+FB01>ltered liquid was evaporated as usual by a current of air.           The
  residue left on evaporation was treated with cold water, and the liquid,
  after being <U+FB01>ltered from the mixture of chloride of lead and extractive
  matter (a) left undissolved, was evapot‘alied as bcf0r0-      The syrupy l‘t‘Sidllc
  now left was well shaken with cold alcohol, which left a portion (6) undis
  Bolved.    The <U+FB01>ltered liquid was evaporatedgand the residue having been
  dissolved in a little alcohol, the solution was mixed with a large quantity of
  ether, which made it milky and produced a copious syrup-like deposit (0).
  This was allowed to settle, and the ethereal liquid was poured off and eva
  porated.     The residue left on evaporation was dissolved in cold alcohol,
  and to the solution there was added an alcoholic solution of acetate of
  lead, which produced a precipitate containing much chloride of lead.          The
  addition   of a little ammonia to the <U+FB01>ltered liquid gave rise to a second
  precipitate,  which was <U+FB01>ltered off, washed, and prepared          in the usual

     This analysis yielded     so large an amount   of nitrogen and     so little hydro
 gen and oxygen as compared with the preceding analyses, that it becomes
 dif<U+FB01>cult to bring it into harmony with the latter without having recourse to
 very improbable hypotheses.            This discordance would, however, not be
 su<U+FB01>icient  to  justify   the   conclusion  that the extractive matter soluble in
 ether contained in the precipitate with ammonia has a different composi
 tion from that prepared in the same way from the two other lead precipi
 tates.   By subsequent experiments it was indeed rendered. very probable
 that they are identical in composition.         It may therefore be inferred that
 in this case the discrepancy was due to some error, perhaps analytical.               I
 should have hesitated in giving the details of this analysis had I not been
 desirous of presenting, without making any selection, the whole of the evi
 dence on which my <U+FB01>nal conclusions are based.
    The syrup-like deposit (0), insoluble in ether, was dissolved in alcohol.
 The solution was mixed with an alcoholic solution of acetate of lead, and
 the precipitate thereby produced was <U+FB01>ltered off, washed with alcohol, and
treated with dilute sulphuric acld.           The excess of acid was removed by
means of carbonate of lead, and the <U+FB01>ltered liquid was evaporated in the
air-current. The residue left on evaporation was treated with cold water,
which left a quantity of chloride of lead undissolved; and to the <U+FB01>ltered
liquid there was added acetate of lead, and then a large quantity of alcohol.
This gave a precipitate which, after being treated in the usual manner, was
analyzed,   the results obtained being as follows :—

therefore defer for the present giving the corresponding formula.
    The syrupy matter, insoluble in cold alcohol (b), was treated with cold
water, which left a quantity     of gelatinous matter undissolved.      Through
the <U+FB01>ltered liquid sulphuretted hydrogen was passed in order to precipitate
the lead in solution, and after being again <U+FB01>ltered it was evaporated in the
air-current to a syrup, which was treated with cold alcohol as long as any
thing was dissolved.      A portion (d)  was left undissolved.     To the <U+FB01>ltered
liquid there was added an alcoholic      solution of acetate of lead, which pro

 tained in this series of experiments was also examined, and a lead compound
 was prepared from it which was submitted to analysis.      The results, how
ever, do not possess sufficient interest to make them worthy of' communica

  On previous occasion the analysis of the lead compound of the extractive
          a
matter soluble in ether led to the formula Cm H,l NOW which differs from
the above by two equivalents of water.     This difference might be ascribed
to   more or less perfect desiccation of the lead compound; but
     a                                                                think                        I    it

     The precipitate with basic acetate of lead was submitted to a process
 which did not differ from that just described, except in being rather simpler
 on account of the absence of phosphoric acid.        It yielded by this treatment
 four substances ; viz. one soluble in ether (a), a second soluble in alcohol
 but insoluble in ether (6), a third insoluble in a mixture of alcohol and
 ether (0), and a fourth insoluble in alcohol as well as in ether ((1). The
 substance soluble in ether   (a) was dissolved in absolute alcohol, and to the
 solution there was added an alcoholic solution of acetate of lead, which gave
 a precipitate  of the usual colour.     This was <U+FB01>ltered off and prepared in the

   The composition of the substance, combined in this case with oxide of
lead, differs, as will be seen, very widely from that of the extractive matter
soluble in ether as determined by previous experiments.           This want of ac
cordance is surprising, and    I can only attribute it to some error in the ana
lysis.    The ratio between the nitrogen, the carbon, and the hydrogen is
about the same as usual, and the discrepancy may therefore have arisen
from an error in the estimation of the oxide of lead.          There was not suf<U+FB01>

   The substances (6) and (c), which I supposed to be essentially the same,
were dissolved together in absolute alcohol.      The solution was <U+FB01>ltered from

    It will  be seen that this analysis yielded numbers not differing very widely
 from those of Analysis      II.   Series D. The composition of the extractive
 matter combined with oxide of lead corresponds in both cases with the for
 mula Cas H2n NO“.          A comparison of the two analyses a<U+FB01>'ords also a
 further corroboration      of what has been stated above, viz. that in the lead
 compounds      containing   chloride of lead, thelatter replaces the same weight,
not an equivalent quantity of oxide of lead.              The. di<U+FB01>'erence between the
amount of oxide of lead of the one compound and that of the chloride and
oxide taken together of the other, is in this case greater than in those before
referred to.
    The precipitate produced by ammonia in the liquid <U+FB01>ltered from that
with basic acetate of lead still remained to be examined.                 In consequence,
however, of a change of residence and other unforeseen circumstances the
investigation    suffered a lengthened interruption at this stage, and was only
rccommcnced after an interval of two years.             During this time the precipi
tate was keptin well-stoppercd bottles covered with water, so as to preserve
it moist and out of immediate contact with the atmosphere.                  It had under
gone    no  perceptible change.         It was therefore  <U+FB01>ltered    off and  treated with
dilute sulphuric acid.       The excess of acid was removed by means of car—
bonate of lead, and the <U+FB01>ltered liquid was evaporated at a moderate tempe
rature in a hot-air stove instead of, as hitherto, by means of a current of
air, which     I  now no longer had the means of producing of the requisite
strength.      The residue left after evaporation was treated with cold water,
which left    a quantity    of chloride of lead of      a  dirty-yellow colour undis

away the sulphurettcd hydrogen and the sulphuric acid contained in it. It

undissolved portion of the syrup (e) and evaporated.        The residue left after

    This formula represents a substance containing several atoms more water
than the extractive matter soluble in ether, the composition of which was
arrived at by Analysis    III.   Series   A.  The tendency to absorption of water
by this body was already indicated by Analysis I.of the present series. Here
it has taken place to a still greater extent, and has probably attained the
extreme possible limit.      The absorption of water in this instance I was at
the time inclined to attribute to the evaporation of the solutions containing
the extractive matters having been conducted at a higher temperature than
before.     I now think it more probable that it was due to the length of time
during which the lead precipitate with ammonia was kept in contact with
water.                                 _
    The syrup-like matter insoluble in alcohol and ether (e) and that inso
luble in ether alone (f) were mixed together and treated with alcohol.
After standing for some time the liquid was poured off from some glutinous
substance (g), which was left undissolved, and evaporated.             The residue
left on evaporation was treated with warm absolute alcohol, which dissolved
the greatest part of it.     To the solution there was added a little acetate of
lead, and after being <U+FB01>ltered from the precipitate it gave, with an excess of
 alcoholic lead solution, an abundant precipitate, which after being treated
 in the usual manner was analyzed.

   These numbers      seem   to point to the conclusion    that the extractive mat
ter insoluble in alcohol had also absorbed a considerable        quantity of water,
in consequence of the long-continued contact of the mixed lead compounds
with water.      As there seemed, however, some reason to suspect the pre
 sence of  glucose in the compound of this analysis, I thought it hardly worth
while to devise any formula to represent its composition.

   The next series of experiments was made with urine obtained from the
surgical wards of the Manchester In<U+FB01>rmary.             By employing material de
rived from an entirely different source,     I  hoped to obtain further con<U+FB01>rma
tion of the results previously arrived at.       I refrained, however, from using
any truly morbid urine for fear of introducing an element of uncertainty
into the experiments.       The urine supplied to me, through the kindness of
the medical of<U+FB01>cers of the Institution, did not di<U+FB02>'er perceptibly       from that
of healthy individuals,      the  appearance, colour,    and reaction   being quite
normal.
   The urine was <U+FB01>rst mixed with       a solution  of acetate of lead, and the pre
cipitate thereby produced was separated and treated in the manner before
described, for the purpose of getting rid of the phosphoric and uric acid
contained in it; and by means of acetate of lead and ammonia a precipitate
was then obtained containing, besides chloride of lead, only compounds of

 120                 Mr. E. Sehunek        on the Colouring      and        [Recess,
 the extractive matters.        This was then added to the lead precipitate pro
 duced by ammonia in the urine after being <U+FB01>ltered from the precipitate with
 acetate of lead.      The mixture contained, therefore, the extractive matters
 of the three lead precipitates, which had before been separately examined.
 It was treated in the manner described near the conclusion of the preceding
 section, that is to say, it was acted on by dilute sulphuric acid ; the hydro
 chloric acid set at liberty was removed by means of sulphate of silver, the
 excess of silver was precipitated as sulphide, the sulphuric acid was got rid
 of with carbonate of lead, and the lead in solution having been precipitated
 with sulphurettcd hydrogen, the liquid was evaporated, leaving a residue
 containing the extractive matters, which were separated from one another
 by means of alcohol and ether.          In this way I obtained a substance soluble
 in alcohol and ether (a), a second soluble in alcohol but insoluble in ether
 (b), and a third insoluble in alcohol and ether (a).           From the <U+FB01>rst a lead

    Several of the preceding analyses gavea composition corresponding more
or   less closely with the same formula, as I shall show when I come to give
a summary       of the whole of the results obtained.
    The substance 0, which was insoluble in alcohol, was treated with cold
water.      The resulting solution was <U+FB01>ltered from some gelatinous matter
 (consisting of silica), which was left undissolved, and then agitated with
oxide of mercury.          After <U+FB01>ltration, sulphuretted hydrogen was passed
through it in order to precipitate the mercury in solution, and after being
<U+FB01>ltered it was evaporated.         The glutinous residue left on evaporation was
dissolved in a very small quantity of water, and the solution was mixed
with a large quantity of alcohol, which precipitated a substance of a gluti
nous nature.       After standing for some time the liquid was poured OE, and
the precipitated matter was washed with alcohol and then dissolved in a
little water. To the solution there was added acetate of lead, which pro
duced a dirty-yellow precipitate; and the addition of a considerable quan
tity of alcohol to the <U+FB01>ltered liquid gave rise to a second precipitate, which
was <U+FB01>ltered o<U+FB01>‘, washed, dried, and analyzed as usual.

   Two of the preceding determinations, viz. Analysis II. Series D and
Analysis IV. Series F, led to nearly the same results, the composition of
the substance contained in the lead compound corresponding in all three
cases with the formula C3, H2, NO“.
   Being curious to ascertain what had been taken up by the oxide of mer
cury which was employed in the puri<U+FB01>cation of the substance used in the
preparation of the last lead compound, it was, after being washed, sus
pended in water and decomposed by a current of sulphuretted hydrogen.’
The <U+FB01>ltered liquid was evaporated to a syrup.           This syrup, which was
very  brown, was   dissolved again in a  very little water, and the solution was
mixed with a large quantity of alcohol, which produced a glutinous deposit.
The latter, after the liquid had been poured off, was dissolved in a little
water, and to the solution there was added acetate of lead, which gave a
dirty-yellow precipitate.     The <U+FB01>ltered liquid was mixed with a large
quantity of alcohol, and the resulting precipitate was <U+FB01>ltered off, washed,
dried, and analyzed.
   0‘71 70 grm. of this precipitate     gave 0-5365 grm. carbonic acid and
0'1650 grm. water.
   1'0915 grm. gave 0'6240 grm. chloride of platinum and ammonium.

   From the unusually large amount of nitrogen yielded by this analysis,
it must be concluded that the oxide of mercury took up some substance
di<U+FB01>'ering in composition from the extractive matters, probably a product
of decomposition of the latter.
   This series of experiments con<U+FB01>rms in a remarkable manner the results

 extractive matters does not vary with the source whence they are derived=
                                         H (1863).
    In   order to remove any doubt that might still have remained in regard
 to the composition        of the urinary extractive matters, I made another series
 of  experiments, employing for this purpose ordinary healthy urine.                    The
 urine was mixed as usual with acetate of lead, and then with basic acetate,
but the precipitate with the latter was alone made use of.                     This, after
 being washed with water, was treated in the manner before described, and
yielded as usual a substance soluble in ether (a), a second soluble in
 alcohol but insoluble in ether (6), a third insoluble in a mixture of alcohol               .
and ether (c), and a fourth insoluble both in alcohol and in ether ((1).
The <U+FB01>rst of these was treated with water, which left a quantity of fatty
matter undissolved.          To the <U+FB01>ltered liquid there was added acetate of lead ;
 and having been again <U+FB01>ltered, it was mixed with a large quantity of
alcohol, which produced a precipitate of the usual appearance.                          The
 analysis   of  this  precipitate  yielded   the  following results  :—
    I. 1'0945 grm. gave 0'8540 grm. carbonic acid and 02115 grm. water.

    If this   composition be compared with that yielded by Analysis             III.  Series
 A,   it will be seen that the difference between them is not greater, even'ae
 regards the amount of oxide of lead, than is usually found in two analyses
 of the same substance. This near approximationi n the results of the <U+FB01>rst
 and the concluding series of experiments, as far as regards one of the ex
 tractive matters, is remarkable.
    The     substances      6 and  0,  though probably one and the            same,    were
 examined separately, in order to remove all doubt as to the identity of
their composition.          The former was treated with absolute alcohol, in which
it was entirely soluble.         To the solution there    was added a    little  acetate  of
lead, and the dark-brown           precipitate   produced   by the latter having been

   Hence    it  follows    that the substances 6 and e have the same composi
tion, a composition      corresponding with the formula CM IIT, N08,, the same
to which Analysis       II.  of the preceding series conducted.
   The substance d was treated with cold water.                The resulting dark
brown solution was <U+FB01>ltered         from some gelatinous matter, which remained
undissolved and was found to consist chie<U+FB02>y of silica, and then mixed with an
excess  of acetate of lead. This produced a dark-brown precipitate, which
was <U+FB01>ltered o<U+FB01>'.      A little ammonia and a large quantity of alcohol were then
added to the liquid, and the bulky cream-coloured precipitate produced
was <U+FB01>ltered off, washed with alcohol, suspended in water, and decomposed
with sulphuretted hydrogen.           The <U+FB01>ltered liquid was evaporated, and the
brown glutinous residue        which  was  left was dissolved in water.   The addi
tion of acetate of lead to the solution produced a brown precipitate.           The
<U+FB01>ltered  liquid gave, on being mixed with alcohol, a cream-coloured preci—

    The unusually large amount of nitrogen yielded by this analysis was
 probably due to an admixture of the impurity which in the former experi
 ments was removed by means of oxide of mercury, and which contains, as
 I have shown, more than seven per cent. of that element. Had employed  I
 the same method of puri<U+FB01>cation as before, the composition would probably
 have corresponded more closely with that to which Analysis             III.  of the
 preceding    series and     several previous determinations led, and which may
 be represented by the formula C3,, H2, N03,.
    The numerical results obtained by these determinations are,            I  think,

 drawn regarding the composition of the urinary extractive matters.

        By EDWARD Scnuncx, F.R.S. Received June 20, 1866*.
    Before entering on a consideration of the analytical details contained in
the <U+FB01>rst part of this memoir, it will be necessary to determine the exact
number of urinary extractive matters. the existence of which am justi<U+FB01>ed  I
in assuming after having brought the examination of their composition to
 a close.    Berzelius, as  I have before stated, inferred from his experiments
 that human urine      contained   three distinct     extractive matters, one soluble
in absolute alcohol, another soluble only in alcohol of sp. gr. 0'833, and a
 third insoluble in alcohol of all strengths, and only soluble in water.              A
similar conclusion would probably he arrived at by any one perusing the
 account which I have given of my own experiments without at the same
time possessing any information regarding the chemical nature of the com
 pounds analyzed.       Nevertheless this conclusion would be incorrect, since
a few simple experiments       suf<U+FB01>ce to prove that the extractive          matter inso
luble in alcohol is not a distinct substance, but invariably contains a quan
tity of alkaline or earthy bases, on the removal of which the organic matter
with which they were combined becomes soluble in alcohol, and that the
extractive matters peculiar to urine are only two in number, the <U+FB01>rst
being soluble in ether and alcohol, the second soluble in alcohol only:
This inference is quite consistent with the results derived from the analyses
of the lead compounds obtained on various occasions from the extractive
matter insoluble in alcohol, the details of which have been given in the <U+FB01>rst
part of this memoir.
    A specimen of the extractive matter insoluble in alcohol was prepared
in the following manner :-Ordinary urine was mixed with acetate of lead,
and the precipitate thereby produced having been separated, basic acetate
of lead was added to the liquid, and the second leadgprecipitate was <U+FB01>ltered
off, washed, and treated with dilute, sulphuric acid.                The excess of the
latter was removed by means of carbonate of lead, and the <U+FB01>ltered liquid
 was evaporated to a syrup, which was treated with alcohol.                  The latter
left  a portion of the syrup undissolved ; and this portion, after being washed
with alcohol, was again dissolved in watei’and sulphuretted hydrogen was
passed through the solution, which, after being <U+FB01>ltered from the precipitated
sulphide of lead, was treated with peroxide of mercury and metallic mercury,
for the purpose of removing the hydrochloric acid contained in it. After
standing some time and being frequently agitated the liquid was <U+FB01>ltered,
and sulphuretted hydrogen was passed through it in order to precipitate
the mercury in solution, and after being again <U+FB01>ltered it was evaporated.
The residue left on evaporation was dissolved in a little water, and the solu
tion was mixed with alcohol as long as any precipitate was produced; the
precipitate collected at the bottom of the vessel forming a brown glutinous

deposit, which, after pouring off the supernatant liquid, was dissolved in
water.    The solution on being evaporated over sulphuric acid left a residue,
consisting of what would be called the urinary extractive matter insoluble
in alcohol.    It had the appearance of a dark brown, amorphous, brittle,
gum~like   mass,  opaque in thick layers, but translucent at the edges.      It had
a slightly acid and nauseous taste.       It was easily reduced by pounding to
a  light brown powder, and when exposed to the air it did not appear to
deliquesce ; but on being afterwards heated in the water-bath it swelled up
considerably and became <U+FB01>lled with small cavities or vesicles, caused
doubtless by the escape of the water which it had absorbed from the
atmosphere.      Its watery solution, which was of a dark yellowish-brown
colour, had an acid reaction.      Its external properties did not differ mate
rially from  those  ascribed to this  substance by Berzelius, who says, “ It has
a yellowish-brown colour, is opaque in the mass ; it has a slightly bitter taste,
remains dry in the air, and dissolves in water with a dark yellow colour.”
    Now the substance as thus prepared was found to contain a considerable
quantity of bases, by combination with which the organic constituents were
rendered insoluble in alcohol.      On being heated on platinum foil it swelled
up considerably, and gave off gaseous products having a smell like that of
burning bread, leaving at last a porous charcoal, which was with great di<U+FB01>i
culty reduced to ash. The ash was greyish-brown and alkaline, but for
the most part insoluble in water; it consisted of oxide of iron, alumina,
carbonate of lime, magnesia, carbonate of soda, and a trace of potash.            A
quantitative  determination   of the  ash  yielded  the following results :—
    0'7665 grin. of the substance heated for some time in the water-bath gave
0'1025 grm. ash = 13'37 per cent.
    The <U+FB01>nely powdered substance communicated no colour whatever to abso
lute alcohol ; but on adding a few drops of concentrated sulphuric acid and
allowing to stand for some time, the liquid acquired a deep yellow colour,
exactly like that of solutions of the extractive matter soluble in alcohol.
The matter left undissolved by the acid mixture was, after pouring off the
liquid and washing with alcohol, treated with water, in which the greatest
part dissolved, but without communicating much colour to the liquid; it
consisted of the sulphates of lime, magnesia, and other bases.          This expe
riment alone would su<U+FB01>icc to prove that the substance contained the extrac
tive matter soluble in alcohol in combination with various bases.         A further
proof was afforded by another experiment.             The watery solutions of the
urinary extractive matters become considerably darker on the addition
either of strong mineral acids, such as hydrochloric acid, or of alkalies.
The deepening of colour in the former case is due to decomposition, in the
latter to mere combination.       Now on taking <U+FB01>ve equal measures of a watery
solution   of the substance under examination, adding to the <U+FB01>rst merely
water, to the second acetic acid, to the third dilute hydrochloric acid, to
the fourth water and suf<U+FB01>cient         caustic  potash to made it just alkaline,
and    t0 the  <U+FB01>fth strong   hydrochloric acid, taking care that the bulk of

 128                Mr. E. Schunck        on the Colouring and           [Recess,
 the <U+FB01>ve liquids should be exactly the same, and then, after pouring them
 into test-tubes of the same bore, comparing together the tints which they
 exhibited, the following differences were observed :—The second was a
little lighter than the <U+FB01>rst; the third, however, was much lighter ; whilst
 the fourth was as dark as, but not darker than the <U+FB01>rst; and the <U+FB01>fth ap
 peared hardly darker than the third; but on being boiled a few moments
 and allowed to cool, its tint was as dark as that of the <U+FB01>rst.       Hence it fol
lows that the colour      of the substance owed a part of its intensity to the
 presence of an alkaline or other base ; for had this not been the case, had
the extractive matter been in an uncombined state, the addition of dilute
acid would have caused a deepening of the tint, or at least have left it un
changed instead of making it lighter, whereas the alkali would have pro
duced a darkening of the colour.         The addition of a large excess of acid
lowered the intensity of the colour in the <U+FB01>rst instance, in consequence of
the acid combining with the bases ; but on heating the solution it had the
effect of deepening the colour, from        the decomposing   action of the acid
on the now free extractive matter.
    In order to isolate the organic body, or bodies, contained in the substance,
some of the latter was dissolved in water, and to the solution basic acetate
of lead was added.      This deprived the solution of its colour, giving an abun
dant cream-coloured      precipitate, which was <U+FB01>ltered off, washed, suspended
in water, and decomposed with sulphuretted hydrogen.           The <U+FB01>ltered liquid
was evaporated at a gentle heat, when it left a brown glutinous residue.
This, when burnt, still left a considerable quantity of ash, which was yellow
and non-alkaline,     and consisted chie<U+FB02>y of alumina with a little oxide of
iron and a trace of lime.      When treated with absolute alcohol, a great part
of this glutinous matter dissolved, yielding a deep yellow solution, while a
quantity of light-brown <U+FB02>ocks was left undissolved.           The <U+FB01>ltered liquid
left on evaporation a brownish—yellow deliquescent substance, which had the
appearance and properties of the extractive matter soluble in alcohol. When
burned, it left only a slight trace of ash.    When treated with boiling caustic
alkaline lye it evolved ammonia.        It was perfectly insoluble in ether, and
was therefore free from the extractive matter soluble in that menstruum.
Its watery solution, when mixed with sulphuric acid and heated for some
time, deposited a quantity of dark brown <U+FB02>ocks, which, after being <U+FB01>ltered
off, washed, and dried, had the appearance o'fa dark brown, almost black
powder (uromelanine), which was almost insoluble in alcohol, but dissolved
readily in aqueous ammonia, giving a brown solution, from which it was re
precipitated   by acids in brown <U+FB02>ocks.       This is the most characteristic pro
perty of the extractive matter soluble in alcohol and insoluble in ether, and
serves to distinguish it from the one soluble in ether, which yields, by
decomposition with strong acids, a brown resinous substance, easily soluble
 in alcohol (urorctine). That portion of the substance derived from the
precipitate   with basic   acetate  of lead, which was left undissolved by abso
lute alcohol in the shape of light brown <U+FB02>ocks, was easily soluble in water.

The solution yielded on evaporation a yellow, brittle, transparent, gum-like
substance,  which, when burnt, left a considerable quantity of reddish
yellow ash.   Hence it appears that the precipitate with basic acetate of
lead contained, besides oxide of lead, other bases in combination with the
organic bodies, a portion of it consisting probably of double compounds of
extractive matter with lead, alumina, lime, &c.    Similar compounds, with
out doubt, were present in the original precipitate thrown down from urine
by basic acetate of lead.   By the second precipitation a great portion of
the alkaline or earthy bases was removed, the portion which remained
forming, by combination with a part of the extractive matter, a compound
insoluble in alcohol.
  The    substance under       examination    contained,   however,    in addition    to
extractive matter, a body having, like glucose, the property of reducing an
alkaline solution of copper, a property which does not belong to either of
the extractive matters in a state of purity. On mixing the watery solution
with sulphate of copper and an excess of caustic soda, it assumed a bright
green colour, and on being boiled deposited          an abundance of suboxide of
copper.   The body producing this reaction   cannot be separated from the
extractive matter            in
                     insoluble  ether by the  use of solvents, since they
behave in the same manner towards ordinary menstrua, nor by crystalliza
tion, as both are, as usually obtained, amorphous.    Both substances are
also precipitated from the watery solution by basic acetate of lead, and
from the alcoholic solution by neutral acetate. If, however, a solution of the
two substances in water contains also earthy and alkaline bases, the glucose
like body tends to combine with these to the esclusion of the extractive
matter, and on now evaporating and treating the residue with alcohol,
provided a su<U+FB01>icient quantity of bases is present, the alcohol takes up only
extractive matter; but if they are de<U+FB01>cient, the solution in alcohol will
contain both.   On the other hand, the compounds of the extractive matter
with bases are less soluble in alcohol than those of the glucose ; so that, on
adding alcohol to a watery solution containing compounds of both bodies,
the precipitate frequently consists of a compound of extractive matter only,
without glucose.    With a knowledge of these facts, it is easy to explain
why in my experiments      I
                         obtained sometimes pure extractive matter, some
times glucose only, and occasionally a mixture of both, without any great
difference in the physical properties of the products being observed.
That the glucose-like body so often accompanying the extractive matters
has a composition   similar to that of grape-sugar, and other substances of the
same class, was proved by the analysis     of its lead compound,~ the results of
which were given in the <U+FB01>rst part of this memoir.
  A specimen of extractive matter, insoluble in alcohol, obtained by eva
porating aportion of the liquid from which the lead compound of Analysis
IV. Series   was precipitated with acetate of lead and alcohol, and which
             1",
had been kept for several years in my collection of products from urine,
gave on examination    similar results.     was It  dark brown, shining,

  130                  Mr. E. Schunck          on the Colouring and             [Recess,
  amorphous      substance, transparent in thin layers, brittle when quite dry,
  but becoming soft and viscid on exposure to the air.                Its taste was acid,
  followed by a bitter after-taste.         When heated it swelled up, gave o<U+FB01>' much
  gas, and left a bulky charcoal, which was easily reduced to a white ash.              A
  determination of the quantity of ash yielded the following results :—
      0'5005   grm.    dried in the water-bath        left 0'0120   grm.   ash=2'39 per
  cent.
      The ash was non-alkaline,          entirely insoluble in water, but soluble in
  hydrochloric acid, and consisted of alumina with traces of oxide of iron and
  lime.    The substance was completely insoluble in boiling absolute alcohol ;
  but on adding       a little concentrated      sulphuric acid, the liquid acquired a
  deep yellow     colour,   and  nearly   the  whole  of the substance dissolved gradu
  ally, though not so easily as in the preceding case.            The alcoholic solution,
 on being mixed with several times its volume of ether, separated into two
 layers, the lower one being of a deep yellow colour, and containing appa
 rently the whole of the extractive matter, while the supernatant ethereal
 liquid   was almost colourless.         The watery solution, when tried in the usual
 manner, was found to contain no trace of glucose.               In this case, therefore,
 the substance consisted of extractive matter only, in combination with
 alumina.       A very small amount of the latter is su<U+FB01>icicnt, as it appears, to
 produce     with  the extractive matter a compound insoluble in alcohol.
      Some of the cream-coloured lead compound,                 which had served for
 Analysis III. Series G, and which had been prepared from a substance
insoluble in alcohol, was treated with a mixture of alcohol and sulphuric
acid.     The liquid, on being left to stand in contact with the compound,
gradually acquired a bright yellow colour like that of a solution of ex:
tractive matter, while the resulting sulphate of lead appeared almost white.
     These experiments lead to the conclusion that there exists no urinary
extractive     matter insoluble in alcohol, and that what has hitherto been
so called consists generally        of  a compound     of the extractive matter soluble
in alcohol, with some base or with several bases mixed occasionally with
similar compounds of the glucose, which so often accompanies this extractive
matter, and is probably one of its products of decomposition.                    Though
the extractive matter soluble in ether forms, with bases, compounds in
soluble in alcohol, I have never found this substance to be a constituent of
the product insoluble in alcohol when prepared in the manner above
                                             '
described.
     I shall now proceed to give my views of the composition of the uncom
bined urinary extractive matters, as deduced from the analytical determi
nations contained in the <U+FB01>rst part of this paper.
     For the extractive matter soluble in alcohol              and   ether when    in its
highest state of purity         I  have adopted the formula C8, II,1 N05,.           The

numbers agreeing tolerably well with this formula, as the following

     do not insist very strongly on the correctness of this formula; since,
for a body the atomic weight of which is so high, and was determined
solely by the amount of nitrogen contained in    other formulae might be             it,

other, as   shall presently show.
                I                 It will, however, hardly be doubted
that the composition                    of this substance                is,       under all          circumstances,      the
same, seeing that the material employed for its preparation in these expe
riments was derived from various sources, at wide intervals of time, and
that    was obtained on one occasion from the precipitate with neutral
           it
acetate of lead, onother occasions from that with basic acetate of lead, or
from all the three lead precipitates combined.
   The second analysis corresponds more closely with the formula CNIIMNOM
than with the one just given, as       have before remarked.
                                                          I     This proves

    In        my earlier experiments,         before        I    had commenced          to employ ether
without alcohol for the separation of the two extractive matters, I occasion
ally obtained mixtures of equal quantities of the two bodies, as proved by
several analyses of lead compounds, the results of which have been given.
For instance, Analyses I. Series A, and I. Series D, conducted to the for
mula C”2 Hm, NON.      By doubling this formula, its relation to the two other

   The Analysis I. Series B, which was made with a similar mixture, led to
the formula Cw Ha6 N037, which only differs from the preceding by three
equivalents of water, from which it is to be inferred that in this case also
both extractive matters were present, and that neither preponderated over
the  other.   These analyses, therefore, though valueless in themselves,

body.
  The later analyses of the lead compounds of this substance corresponded
with the formula C“ H27 N032, as will be seen from the following Table, in

   The di<U+FB02>'erence in composition to which the two formulae point       in my                       is,
opinion, to be attributed not to any errors of analysis, nor to any variation
in the quality of the urine employed on different occasions, but rather to                                       a
difference in the mode of preparation.    In the later series of experiments
arti<U+FB01>cialheat was employed in the evaporation of the solutions instead of
the current of cold air made use of for the same purpose at the commence
ment of the investigation.     am inclined to think that, in consequence of

the elevation of temperature, slight as was, the substance took up four

not be considered as identical.           If a distinct name is to be bestowed on the
latter, I would suggest orurianine as the most appropriate.                     There are
indications of the presence of this substance in the earlier experiments also.
For    instance,    Analysis II. Series E gave a composition not differing very
widely    from    that   to which the later determinations conducted.
     The Analyses IX. Series A and I. Series 0 gave numbers corresponding
with the formula CBu H,l N07,, which seems to indicate that the substance
analyzed was a mixture of oxurianine and glucose, since
                     Cw H11N01o=cas H21 N032+4 (012 H11 011)'
    This supposition was con<U+FB01>rmed by an examination of the lead compound
of   the analysis last named, aportion of which still remained.                On treating
some of this compound, which was of a pale cream-colour, with dilute sul
phuric acid, I obtained a yellow solution which was <U+FB01>ltered from the sul
phate of lead.            A portion of this solution, on being mixed with more
acid and heated, became darker, and deposited a quantity of brown <U+FB02>ocks,
which is an indication of the presence of urianine or of oxurianine.
Another portion became, on the addition of sulphate of copper and an
excess of caustic alkali, of a deep blue colour, and on being boiled de
posited an abundance of suboxide of copper.
     The Analysis 1V. Series A, which led to the formula C50 H39 NO“, like
wise represents a mixture of oxurianine and glucose, 1 equivalent of each
having been present in this case.
    The analyses of the lead compounds                 prepared    from the so-called    ex
tractive    matter,     insoluble   in alcohol, support the view which I take of its
nature, viz. that it consists in most cases of a compound of the extractive
matter soluble in alcohol with bases, since these analyses gave for the sub
stance, combined with oxide of lead, numbers corresponding with the for
mula C:m H29 NO“, as will be seen on glancing over the results, which are
here subjoined       :—

    The tendency to absorb water on the part of these substances, which                    I
have pointed out in the case of urian, shows itself here also.                 Seeing that
the body having a composition corresponding to the formula C“ H29 NO“
was always obtained from compounds of extractive matter with bases, it is
probable that its formation from the one having the formula C“ Hm. NOa2
is due to the action of bases, an action which so often leads to the ab
sorption     of water by organic bodies.

134        On the Colouring and Extractive Matters of Urine.                                    [Recess,
  In the preceding review several of the determinations                                  given in Part    I.
have not been referred to. - They are as follows :—

  Of   these     A.   II.     and   A. VI. gave numbers corresponding very                     well with
the formula 062 H,(,              NO“, which may be considered to represent                    a mixture
of what may be called the hydrates of urian and urianine, since
                  2 (C82 H,6          NO,,)=C,,G          HM, NOGO+ Ca, H33         NO“.
   A hydrate having the formula OH, H," NO8° was once isolated, and its
lead compound was submitted to analysis    V.) ; but the other was not
obtained in my experiments, though Analysis V. Series A gave results
agreeing with the formula (J38 H” N029,
                                        which represents a compound of
urianine and water.    The substance with which Analysis VII. Series A
was made  was  probably a mixture of oxurianine and glucose, examples of
which occurred        frequently in the course of my experiments, as     have                     I
before     explained.    The Analyses I. Series E and   Series F are the only II.
determinations   of importance which admit of no explanation, unless it be
assumed   that considerable errors were committed in making them.
  I  maintain, then, that, with the exceptions just named, the numerical re
 ults obtained in my examination of the composition of these bodies may be
explained by adopting the views
                                    which                         I
                                              have set forth, views which, I
venture to say, have at least the merit of simplicity to recommend them.
Whether they are correct or not                       I
                                    should, however, despair of arriving any
nearer the truth by still further multiplying experiments of the kind I have
described, and         I
                 therefore have brought this portion of the investigation to
a close.
   The striking analogy subsisting between the extractive matters of urine
and the series of bodies of which indican forms the <U+FB01>rst member is a point
of some interest, to which I shall have again occasion to refer. The rela
                                                                                        is,
tion in which urian and urianine stand to one another              in my opinion,
similar to the one which  has been   found  to  exist between   indican  and indi
canine.    Then, again, both  urianine   and   indicanine  take   up  oxygen, and
are converted              into   oxurianine          and     oxindicanine,     bodies which,    in their
physical properties, resemble those from which they
                                                             are derived.   It                             is
indeed  not impossible that  oxindicauine  may  be actually  converted by    very                     a
simple process   into   oxuriauine,   as  will be  evident  from  the  following
equation :-—
                                                                   .

   Processes such as the one represented by this equation are constantly
going on in the body, and       therefore quite possible that the indican
                                            it   is
originally existing in the blood or tissues may be decomposed, and appear
in the urine as ordinary extractive matter.    Indeed the same process may
take place   in the urine itself  as   result of fermentation and oxidation,

 which may      serve  to explain the fact of the existence of indican in urine
 having   so frequently    been overlooked.
    From the experiments hitherto described, I am justi<U+FB01>ed, I think, in
 drawing the following conclusions :—
    1. Human urine contains, under all circumstances,                  two distinct and
 peculiar   extractive   matters, one  of  which   is  soluble   in   alcohol  and ether,
 while the other is soluble in alcohol but insoluble in ether.
    2. The composition of these bodies is almost always the same, the slight
 variations which are found to occur being due, not to any difference in the
 quality or source of the urine employed at various times, but rather to the
 decomposition which takes place during the process of preparation, and
which cannot be entirely avoided.
    3. Both substances contain nitrogen as an essential constituent, but in
 so small a proportion as to show that their atomic weight must be very
high.                                                                       v
    4. Both substances have a tendency to take up water, especially when
their aqueous solutions are heated or mixed with strong acids.
    5. The extractive matter insoluble in ether takes up a certain proportion
of oxygen, and is converted into         a product,    which does not differ in its
appearance      or its   most obvious    physical    properties     from     the original
substance.
    6.  There exists no urinary extractive matter insoluble              in alcohol,  the
substance hitherto so called consisting in most cases            of compounds of     one
of the true extractive matters with various bases.
 III.  “ On    a Crystalline Fatty Acid from Human Urine.” By EDWARD
       SCHUNCK, F.R.S.          Received September 21, 1866*.
    The occurrence of fatty matter in urine is       a somewhat rare phenomenon,
and is generally       considered as a symptom of disease, or at least of an
abnormal     state  of the system. In most cases it is found associated with
                                     “
albumen, forming the so-called          chylous urine,” in which the fatty matter
is suspended     in  such extremely   minute   particles as to give the liquid the
appearance of milk.         In a few instances it has occurred in the shape of
<U+FB02>uid oil-globules <U+FB02>oating about in the urine; but it is more frequently
found enclosed in cells, which sink and form a deposit at the bottom of the
vessel.    Fatty matter is a constituent of kiesteine, the pellicle which is
sometimes formed on the surface of the urine of pregnant women; and a
fat resembling butter was obtained from it by Lehmann, though by some
authors the very existence of kiesteine as a peculiar deposit is doubted.
Lastly, a few cases are described in which a fat-like substance was passed
with the urine in the form of small concretions, which, when fresh, were
soft and elastic, but dried into hard, yellow, wax-like masses (Heller’s
                * Read November   15, IBGG : sec Abstract, vol. xv. p. 258.

 136                   Mr. E. Schuan      on a Crystal/inc             [Recess,
 urostealith).     In no recorded instance was the fatty matter contained      in
 the secretion in a state of true solution.
    The accounts which are given of the physical and chemical properties of
 the fatty matters of urine are extremely vague, and quite insufficient to
 enable us to identify them, so that it may be concluded that in most cases
 the quantity obtained was extremely small.       Dr. Beale has, indeed, shown
 that the fatty matter which accumulates in the epithelial cells, passed with
 the urine in some cases of fatty degeneration of the kidney, contains
 cholesterine; and Berzelius and Lehmann state that urine, when distilled
with the addition of sulphuric acid, yields butyric acid ; but in other
respects our ignorance is almost complete.       None of the works devoted to
the subject of urine contain a hint which would lead one to suppose that
fatty matter in any form is a constituent of the ordinary healthy secretion.
    These few words will probably suf<U+FB01>ce to give an idea of the present state
of our knowledge on this subject from a chemical point of view.
    The discovery of which I am about to give an account was a. result of
the examination of the colouring and extractive matters of urine with which
I have been occupied for some time, and which forms the subject of several
Papers already communicated to the Royal Society.          In the course of my
experiments, I observed on several occasions, mixed with the urinary ex
tractive matters, drops of a brown or yellow oil, the appearance of which
I could not account for, since it was difficult to conceive how fat of any
kind could be deposited from watery solutions of these extractive matters,
which generally have. an acid reaction ; unless, indeed, it was assumed either
that it was a product of decomposition, or that the extractive matters possess
the property of effecting the solution or suspension of fatty matter in water.
On one occasion there was deposited during the evaporation of a watery
solution of urian (the extractive matter soluble in ether) a quantity of fatty
acid, from which I prepared a baryta-salt soluble in boiling alcohol, and
crystallizing from this solution     in small scales.  Traces  ofa fat-like sub
stance were almost always obtained on treating watery solutions of the ex
tractive matters with animal charcoal, <U+FB01>ltering, treating the charcoal with
boiling alcohol, and evaporating the alcoholicliquid.      Animal charcoal also
effected  the separation of a small quantity of fatty matter from urine itself,
and this circumstance led me to devise a plan for procuring a quantity
sufficiently large to enable me to determine its chief properties.          This
method     I shall now proceed to describe.
                                                     '
   Ordinary healthy urine, having been <U+FB01>ltered so as to separate all insoluble
matter, is passed in successive portions through puri<U+FB01>ed animal charcoal
contained     in a common     percolating apparatus.    The percolating liquid
appears quite colourless, and devoid of the usual odour of urine.        A large
quantity of urine may thus be passed with the same effect through a small
quantity of charcoal; but at last there arrives a point at which the char
coal, though apparently retaining its decolorizing and deodorizing power
undiminished,     suffers the liquid to pass through with extreme slowness

only, and the latter, after having percolated, appears rather milky, from a
small quantity of white matter suspended in it. At this point it is advi
sable to discontinue   the percolation of urine and to commence washing the
charcoal      with water. This is continued until every trace of chlorides and
phosphates is removed, and the charcoal is then laid to dry, either in the
air or at a moderate temperature in a stove. When dry the charcoal is treated
with boiling alcohol, to which it communicates a bright yellow colour like
that of urine itself, the liquid is <U+FB01>ltered, and the process is repeated until
the alcohol acquires only a faint yellow colour.     To arrive at a point at
which it would appear quite colourless seemed to me almost impossible.
The whole of the alcoholic liquid, which in any case is considerable in
quantity, is now evaporated either spontaneously or at a moderate tem
perature.  The brown syrupy residue which is left on evaporation is mixed
with water, which leaves undissolved a quantity of dark-brown semi<U+FB01>uid
fatty matter to be separated by <U+FB01>ltration. The liquid, which has a yellow
colour, contains in solution a crystallized organic substance, the occurrence
of which in urine has not hitherto been observed. It also contains, pro
vided the evaporation   of the alcoholic liquid was conducted spontaneously,
a  quantity of indican; for on the addition of sulphuric or hydrochloric
acid, it deposits <U+FB02>ocks of indigo-blue—a reaction which, however, ceases to
be produced after the solution has stood for some time in a warm place.
Its colour is mainly due to the ordinary extractive matters of urine which
it   contains.
   The fatty matter which is left undissolved by the water has a dark-brown
colour and a strongly urinous odour. In order to purify          dissolved in

pressed between blotting-paper, in order to absorb as much as possible the
more fluid portion, and          then redissolved in alcohol.

evaporation the solution leaves a perfectly white crystalline residue con
sisting of the acid in a state of purity.
   As thus prepared, the substance has all the properties characteristic of
the group of fatty acids to which palmitic and stearic acid belong.    It is
white, has a pearly lustre and a crystalline appearance, and when viewed
under the microecope is seen to consist of small star-shaped masses.  From
a solution in boiling dilute spirits it is deposited, on the solution cooling, in
shining scales.    The alcoholic solution reddens litmus-paper slightly; it
<U+FB02>oats on the surface of water, which it repels like all other fats.         When
the water is heated, it melts into oily drops, which on cooling become solid
and crystalline.   Its melting-point, as determined with an apparently pure
specimen, is 54°‘3 C.       When impure,     t'.e. contaminated    with the body
which imparts the brownish-yellow colour to the crude product,        it  fuses at
a lower temperature.    A   specimen only slightly coloured melted at 52°‘8 C.,
another at 49°'5 C.      When heated between two watch-glasses, the acid
fuses and     then volatilized, leaving only
               is                               a trace of residue, while there is
formed on the upper glass an oily sublimate, which on cooling becomes
solid and glassy.    This sublimate dissolves easily in alcohol, and the solu
tion leaves on spontaneous evaporation      awhite crystalline residue consist
ing of needles arranged in star-shaped or feather-like masses.        The sub
stance dissolves as easily in ether as in alcohol, and the solution leaves on
evaporation   white crystalline mass.

tions froth on being boiled like those of ordinary soap.    The solution in
potash  deposits on cooling   a quantity of white pearly scales, which settle
slowly to the bottom  of  the vessel.   The soda compound separates in the
form of   thick, white, amorphous soap, very small quantity of which

suf<U+FB01>cient to cause the liquid to gelatinize on cooling.      The ammoniacal
solution  deposits on cooling     quantity of scales, which resemble the

potash compound, together    with   few crystalline needles.

tions of carbonate of potash and carbonate of soda also dissolve the acid
readily.   When the residue left by evaporating the solution in carbonate
of potash  to dryness  istreated with boiling absolute alcohol, an alcoholic
solution of the potash-soap     isobtained, which, after being <U+FB01>ltered from
the excess of carbonate of potash and spontaneously evaporated, leaves          a
residue consisting partly of isolated prismatic crystals, partly of star-shaped
masses.    The soda compound may in the same manner he obtained in              a
crystalline state.  The alcoholic solution of either of these compounds gives
with acetate of baryta  a white crystalline deposit.    A watery solution gives
with nitrate of silver  awhite, curd-like precipitate, which blackens slowly
on exposure to the light.    The ammoniacal solution of the acid produces,
with the chlorides of barium and calcium, white, <U+FB02>occulent precipitates,
which do not become crystalline on standing. The alcoholic solution yields
with acetate of lead, an abundant white amorphous precipitate.

    These experiments lead to the conclusion that human urine contains in
 a state of solution a crystalline fatty acid, having the general properties of
 the members of this class, which are solid at the ordinary temperature.
 The quantity of this substance which I obtained was too inconsiderable to
 enable me to determine its composition, and the melting-point therefore
afforded the only means of ascertaining whether it is identical with any of
the known fatty acids or not. Were it not for the low melting-point there
would be nothing to oppose the conclusion that it is palmitic acid, one of the
constituents of human fat. It      however, is,well-known fact that mixtures
                                                                a
of two solid fatty acids in certain proportions melt at lower temperature    a
than the most fusible even of the constituents. For instance, according
to Heintz,   amixture of 30 parts of stearic acid with 70 of palmitic acid
fuses at 55°'l 0., though the melting-point of the former when pure                                       is
70° and of the latter 60°.    This urinary acid may therefore be      mixture                  a
of this kind and not      peculiar
                                 a  substance—in   fact  mixture of   thea two
acids just named, which, according to recent investigations,        constitute
together what was formerly called margaric acid, the solid acid of human
fat.
    Considering how many of the organs and secretions of the human body
contain fat, it  need not excite surprise that      minute quantity of fatty acid
                                                                 a

from other causes. That          forms it normal constituent of the secretion

I  do not venture to assert, though the urine employed in my experiments
in no case exhibited anything peculiar, and when submitted to the process
above described, never failed to yield     little of the fatty acid. The quan
                                                       a
tity obtained was always extremely small. In one experiment, for instance,
45 litres of urine yielded 0'14 grm. of tolerably pure acid, which, assuming
the urine to have been of average composition,           would be equal to the
22000th part of its solid constituents. It        far from certain, however, that
                                                                is
this was the total quantity contained in it. The simple method of sepa
rating the substance from the urine which             have described will enable
                                                                     I

almost  insoluble in water, comes to be dissolved in urine will naturally
suggest itself, but    itone to which

        By EDWARD Scunxca, F.R.S.                 Received November 15, 1866*.
    When urine       is allowed   to percolate through animal charcoal in the
 manner described       in the preceding Paper, several organic substances are
 absorbed and separated by the charcoal in addition to the fatty acid there
 referred   to.    The liquid obtained by treating the charcoal with boiling
 alcohol   yields on evaporation a syrupy residue, of which a great part dis
 solves in water, the fatty acid being left undissolved.             The <U+FB01>ltered liquid
 on being again evaporated leaves a brown syrup, among which a quantity
 of yellowish crystals is formed on standing.              On treating the mass with
 cold alcohol, the syrupy portion, consisting of urinary extractive matter, is
 removed, the crystals being left undissolved.             The latter are <U+FB01>ltered off,
 washed with alcohol, and then dissolved in boiling water.                 The solution,
 which has a slightly yellow        colour,  is evaporated to a small volume, and
 the crystals, which separate on standing, are pressed between blotting-paper
 and then dissolved in a little boiling water to which a small quantity of
 animal charcoal is added.         The <U+FB01>ltered solution, if tolerably concentrated,
 becomes on cooling almost solid, from the formation of a quantity of white
 crystalline needles, which, after the liquid has been drained o<U+FB01>", only re
 quire drying.      The substance as thus prepared consists of pure oxtiluratc
 of ammonia, since it is found to possess both the properties and the com
 position of that salt, as I shall now proceed to show.
    The crystals of which it consists are mostly small, and exhibit, even when
 magni<U+FB01>ed, few well-de<U+FB01>ned forms.            When a few drops of the watery solu
 tion are allowed to evaporate spontaneously on a slip of glass, the residue,
when viewed under the microscope, is found to consist mainly of groups of
 crystals arranged round centres in various irregular forms, the larger ones
being composed of prisms, which are acumiuated, jagged at the edges, and
 transversely striated, the smaller ones of needles arranged in star-shaped,
 double fan-shaped, or circular masses.            Occasionally isolated crystals are
seen, having the form of rhombic plates, some of which have two of their
opposite angles truncated.         I have not yet had an opportunity of compa
ring these forms with those exhibited by the oxalurate of ammonia obtained
directly from uric acid.          The substance is tolerably soluble in boiling
water, but very slightly soluble in boiling alcohol, the little which dis
solves in the latter being deposited, on the solution cooling, in <U+FB01>ne needles
arranged in stars. The watery solution is neutral to test-paper; but on al
lowing a drop to fall on blue litmus-paper, and exposing the latter to the
air for some hours, the spot will appear quite red.           The watery solution, on
being mixed with hydrochloric or nitric acid, yields a white crystalline de
posit (oxnluric acid), which, on being left in contact with the acid liquid, gra
dually disappears.       If nitric acid has been employed and the solution, after

the deposit has dissolved, be spontaneously evaporated, amass of crystals is
left, some of which have the well-known form of nitrate of urea, while the
others are prismatic,     and consist doubtless of oxalic acid.     If the solution,
after the addition    of any strong acid, be boiled, oxalic‘acid may after a few
moments be detected in it.         The watery solution gives no precipitate with
chloride of calcium, not even on the addition of ammonia; but on boiling,
an abundant precipitation of oxalate of lime takes place. If a tolerably con
centrated solution be mixed with chloride of calcium and left to stand, it
deposits after some time a quantity of prismatic lustrous crystals, consisting
doubtless of oxalurate of lime. The watery solution gives no immediate pre—
cipitate with nitrate of silver; but after a few moments it begins to deposit
white crystalline needles, which, if the solution was concentrated, increase to
such an extent as to <U+FB01>ll the whole liquid.          These needles are silky in ap
pearance, and do not blacken on exposure to the light, but only become
slightly yellow; they dissolve easily in ammonia, but no reduction takes
place on boiling the solution.       The watery solution of the substance gives
with acetate of lead a copious crystalline deposit, and if this be <U+FB01>ltered off, the
solution yields on standing a crop of small lustrous crystals. These crystals,
when examined under the microscope,         are found to have very regular forms,
consisting of elongated four-sided prisms, with six terminal faces. Whether
this form is the same as that of the oxalurate of lead, prepared with acid
obtaided from the usual source, I cannot say, as I have been unable to <U+FB01>nd
any description of the salt in the books.           The watery solution gives no
precipitate   with  perchloride   of mercury  ; but  on the addition of chloride of
zinc   it deposits after some   time a quantity  of white, hard crystalline grains,
which, after being <U+FB01>ltered off and washed, are found to contain no chlorine,
and on being heated, melt and burn, leaving a white residue of oxide of
zinc.     If the substance is dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid, and the
solution, after the addition of bichloride of platinum, is evaporated to
dryness, the residue on being treated with cold alcohol dissolves partly, a
quantity of shining yellow crystals, consisting of chloride of platinum and
ammonium, being left undissolved.
    Such are the principal reactions of this substance.       Its analysis yielded
 the following results :—
    0'6230 grm. lost, on being heated for several hours in the water-bath,
 0'0030 grm., or 0'48 per cent., a loss too trifling to be attributed        to any
thing but hygroscopic moisture.

    It  is therefore     certain   that the substance obtained        by this process is
oxalurate of ammonia.            These experiments, however, by no means decide
the question whether          the oxaluric acid exists originally in a free. or com
bined state, since most chemists             deny the presence of ready-formed am
monia in urine ; and it is quite possible that in my experiments a suf<U+FB01>cient
quantity of ammonia was formed by the decomposition of urea to saturate
the oxaluric acid present.          Still I incline to the opinion that the ammonia
salt preexisted in the urine examined, since there were no perceptible indi
cations of decomposition during the percolation of the urine through animal
charcoal, a process, indeed, which would rather tend to prevent decompo
sition than to promote it.           The acid reaction of the urine might be urged
as an objection to this view; but, on the other hand, it may safely be
asserted that we are still in the dark as to the cause of the acid reaction of
urine, which may be due to an acid or acids much weaker than oxaluric.
     Whether oxaluric acid, either free or combined, is a normal constituent
of    human urine or not, is a question which may also be raised; but it is
 one to which      I am unable to give a decided reply, as my experiments are
not suf<U+FB01>ciently numerous for the purpose.                  I may venture, however, to
 express my opinion that this acid will be found to be a constituent of the
 healthy secretion      '.    The presence of oxaluric acid in urine had been pre
 viously suspected, since the dumb-bell crystals occasionally found among
 the deposits of oxalate of lime are supposed, by Golding Bird and others,
 to consist     of oxalurate       of lime,    though the evidence on which this
 opinion is founded is unsatisfactory,           and has been refuted by other obser
 vers.
     On the other hand, there can be no doubt that the presence of oxaluric
 acid or its compounds in urine, whether it be an exceptional phenomenon
 or not, serves to explain, in an easy and satisfactory manner, the formation
    * In a mixture, or any impure product supposed to contain oxaluric acid,         I would
 recommend its detection in the following manner :—The matter, if soluble, should be
 dissolved in water; but if it is insoluble, in consequence of the presence of some base, a
 little sulphuric acid should be added to set at liberty the oxaluric acid, after which the
 solution should be mixed with acetate of lead; and if any precipitate is thereby pro
 duced, this must be <U+FB01>ltered oil' and the liquid left to stand, when it deposits small
 shining crystals if oxaluric acid is present. The residue obtained by evaporation of
 the mother-liquid     of creatine, obtained from urine in the usual manner by means 'of
 chloride of zinc, gave, when treated in this way, crystals which could not be distinguished
 by their form from oxalurate of lead. Oxalurate of silver, distinctly                    can
  only be obtained from perfectly pure oxaluric acid.

 The attempts which have been made to prove that oxalate of lime may
 exist ready formed and in     astate of solution in the urine are also unsatis
 factory, the only known solvent likely to occur naturally being acid phos
 phate of soda.    Were this salt really the means of keeping the oxalate
 dissolved, the latter would only be deposited when the acid reaction of the
urine had disappeared, or had at least somewhat diminished, which           is not
the case.      Now,   however,   the whole process may      be   easily explained.
 Oxalnric acid, as all chemists know, may be considered as        a   compound of
oxalic acid and urea minus water, its composition corresponding to that of
oxamic acid.      By the action of acids, alkalies, or even water at       a  high
temperature,       itdecomposed, yielding
                        is                   oxalic acid  and  urea.    How  easily
this process of decomposition may be set up in urine when allowed to
stand, or even boiled, need not be pointed out. The oxalic acid as soon as
formed combines, of course, with the lime which        isalways present in urine,
producing    the well-known    deposit  of oxalate.  Those    who maintain, with
Rees, that oxalate of lime may be produced in the urine after excretion are
therefore quite correct, though the phenomenon has hitherto been wrongly
interpreted.    The conversion of oxaluric into oxalic acid may, however,
commence already in the bladder, or even more remote parts of the system,
and thus lead to the formation of concretions and calculi.         Regarding the
origin of the oxaluric acid of urine there can be little doubt. In the animal
frame,~ just as in the laboratory,     must be formed by the oxidation of uric
                                      it

I. “On     a  New Class of Bodies Homologous to Hydrocyanie Acid.”—
   1.   By A. W. HOI-‘MANN, LL.D., F.R.S. Received August 20, 1867.
    The typical transformation which hydrocyanic acid undergoes when sub
mitted, under appropriate circumstances, to the action of water, is capable
of assuming two different forms when accomplished in its homologues.
    If the hydrocyanie molecule be found to <U+FB01>x the elements of two mole
cules of water, yielding ultimately formic acid and ammonia, it is obvious
that the atom group which in the homologues of hydrocyanic acid we as
sume in the place of hydrogen may be eliminated when these homolognes
are decomposed by water in conjunction either with formic acid or with
ammonia.       To take an example :—When acting with water upon the sim
plest homologue of hydrocyanie acid (upon cyanide of methyl), we may ex
pect to see the methyl-group separating either in the form of methyl-formic,
i. e. acetic acid, or in the form of methyl-ammonia, i. e. of methylamine.
The di<U+FB01>'erence of the two reactions and their relation to the metamorphosis
of hydrocyanic acid itself are exhibited by the following equations :—

    The former one of these processes of transformation is familiar to che
 mists from the study of the hydrocyanic ethers or nitriles. The <U+FB01>rst mem
 ber of this remarkable group of bodies (cyanide of ethyl) was discovered by
 Pelouze; the general character of their transformation was subsequently
 established by the beautiful investigations of Kolbe and Frankland on the
 one hand, and by those of Dumas, Malaguti, and Le Blane on the other.
     Researches in which I have been engaged during the last few weeks have
 proved that the second process of transformation does not less frequently
 occur.    Indeed I have found that there corresponds to each of the hydro
 cyanic ethers or nitriles known hitherto, a second body of precisely the
 same composition but of absolutely different properties.        These substances,
 when changed by water, undergo the transformation which is exhibited by
  the last one of the three above equations.
     A happy experiment has led me to the discovery of this new class of
  bodies.    In a lecture I wanted to exhibit the interesting transformation of

1867.]                Homologous to Hydrocyanic Acid.                                   145
ammonia into prussic acid by means of chloroform, which was <U+FB01>rst observed
by M. Cloez, and which illustrates so well our present views on quantiva
lence. When the two substances alone are allowed to act upon one another,
this reaction can be rapidly accomplished only at a high temperature and
consequently under pressure. In order to shorten the process (in one word,
in order to exhibit this important reaction in a lecture-experiment), had          I
added potash to the mixture for the purpose of <U+FB01>xing the newly formed
prussic acid, and was delighted to <U+FB01>nd that a few seconds’ ebullition was
suf<U+FB01>cient to yield a considerable amount of cyanide of potassium, so as to
furnish, after the addition of the two salts of iron, a large quantity of Prus
sian blue. On subsequently repeating the experiment with some of the de
rivatives of ammonia, more especially with several primary monamines,                     I
was astonished to observe in each case a powerful reaction giving rise to the
evolution of vapours of an almost overwhelming odour, strongly recalling
that of prussic acid.   But few experitnents were necessary for the purpose
of isolating the odoriferous bodies. The compounds thus formed are the
substances isomeric with the hydrocyanic                ethers or nitrilcs hitherto      ex
amined.
    From the host of bodies which         were     thus suddenly thrown into view, it
was necessary to single out the compound              of a particular series in order to
determine by accurate experiments the nature of the new reaction.       The
facility of procuring the necessary material, as well as old predilections,
suggested the phenyl-series as the one to be examined in the <U+FB01>rst place.
I beg leave to submit to the Royal Society a brief account of the mode of
preparation, and of the principal properties, of the new derivative of aniline.
                                Cyanide qu/zenyl.
    A   mixture of aniline, chloroform,   and alcoholic potash yields on distillation
a   liquid of   a powerfully    aromatic but, at the same time, hydrocyanic—acid
 like odour.      The vapour of the liquid gives rise          to a peculiar bitter taste,
 and causes, moreover, in the throat the suffocating sensation so characteristic
 of hydroeyanic acid. On redistilling the liquid, alcohol and water pass
 <U+FB01>rst, and ultimately an oily body is procured, which, in addition to the
 smelling substance, still contains a large amount of aniline.  The latter is
 separated by   oxalic acid, when  the powerfully smelling compound remains
 in the form of    a brownish loil.                 by hydrate of potassium
                                        Freed from'water
 and puri<U+FB01>ed by distillation, the new body presents itself as a mobile liquid,
 exhibiting a greenish colour in transmitted, and a beautifully blue colour
 in reflected light. This colour does not disappear by distillation              even    in a
 current of hydrogen.
    The analysis of the blue oil has established the formula
                                          C.,   H, N.

    Cyanide of phenyl cannot be volatilized without undergoing decompo
sition.   During distillation the thermometer marks for some time the con
stant temperature  of 167°, which may be taken as the boiling-point of
cyanide of phenyl.  Then the temperature rises rapidly to from 220° to
230°.   The brown liquid which now distils  destitute of odour, and soli

    In aletter   submitted      to  the Royal Society some weeks ago I directed
attention to a new series of homologucs and analogues of hydrocyanic acid,
generated by the action of chloroform on the primary monamines.                        As a
representative    of this group of bodies,         I described the cyanide of phenyl,
the formation    and    the  properties   of  which   had been almost exclusively the
subject of my researches.
    I have followed up the study of these new bodies, which have become

Being formed       in awell-de<U+FB01>ned         reaction,   endowed     with properties quite
unexpected, stable in certain cases,           and of extreme alterability in others,
capable of the most varied reactions             that  can be imagined,       these bodies
possess all the characters which invite a detailed examination.                     Thus  I
<U+FB01>nd myself      at   the   threshhold     of   a   long  investigation,    the   results of
which I beg permission to submit to the Royal Society in the order in
which they present themselves.
                                    Cyanide    of Ethyl.
    After having <U+FB01>xed in the phenylie group the general characters of the
reaction, my attention was very naturally directed to the cthylic series.
For this purpose, it was <U+FB01>rst necessary to procure ethylamine in rather
considerable quantities.         Happily in this case the liberal cooperation, so
often experienced, of my friend Mr. E. C. Nicholson, was again at hand.
Interesting himself with a cordiality, for which            I   cannot su<U+FB02>iciently thank
him, in the continuation of my researches on the ethylic bases, Mr.
Nicholson had placed at my disposal the product of the action of ammonia
on iodide of ethyl produced in a single operation performed in one of his
great autoclaves on 20 kilogs. of iodide of ethyl.
    Thanks to the happy alliance between science and industry, which cha
racterizes our times, I was thus enabled to study the transformation                     of
ethylamine    under    the  influence   of  chloroform    on  a  rather large  scale.
    On gradually introducing a mixture of an alcoholic solution of ethyl
aminc and chloroform        into a retort containing powdered potassic hydrate, a
most powerful reaction takes place; the mixture. enters into ebullition, and
a liquid distils over, the penetrating odour of which surpasses anything that
it is possible to conceive.        Besides the odoriferous body the product of the
distillation contains ethylamine, chloroform, alcohol, and water, and a con
siderable number of recti<U+FB01>cations are required in order to isolate the cyanide
of ethyl from this mixture.
    As the substance is rather volatile, the frequently repeated fractional
distillations become a most painful operation, and more than once, while I
have been engaged in these experiments, my laboratory has been almost
inaccessible.     Thus with a temperature of 30° I have found it desirable to

interrupt for the time the preparation in the pure state of the cyanide of
ethyl, and to resume it at a more favourable season.
  I  was nevertheless curious to study, even now, a true homologue of
cyanide of ethyl in order to compare its properties with those of cyanide of
phenyl.     The boiling-points            of the amylic compounds                    being within con
venient    limits,    I    was induced      to select the amyl-series                as presenting        the
greatest chance of success.
   On submitting amylamine to the action of chloroform, the same pheno
mena are observed as in the analogous reaction between chloroform and
aniline.  One molecule of amylamine and one molecule of chloroform con
tain the elements of one molecule of cyanide of amyl and three of hydro
chloric acid :—

  The cyanide of amyl is             a transparent      colourless liquid lighter than water,
insoluble in water, but dissolved by alcohol and ether, of an oppressive odour,
resembling at the same time that of amylic alcohol and of hydrocyanic acid.

     I have designated the body described in this note by the name of cyanide
 of amyl;      I  am of course aware that the same name has been given to the
 substance produced by the action of cyanide of potassium on the sulph
 amylates ; but as the latter compound, in consequence of its transformation
into caproic acid and ammonia, has a right to the name caprom'trile, l have
thought it desirable to distinguish, provisionally at least, the new product
 by the name of cyanide of amyl.
    The examination of the cyanides of amyl and phenyl establishes in a
 positive manner the existence of a group of bodies isomeric with the nitriles
 derived from the ordinary alcohols and phenols.
    I have not as yet pursued more minutely the study of the other terms of
these groups; in fact the <U+FB01>eld opened by these new observations presents
questions much more attractive.               The existence of the new homologues of
hydrocyanic        acid  allow  us  to foresee   the formation of quite another series
of homologues of cyanogen.              These bodies will be produced by the action
of chloroform on the diamines.             Ethylene-diamine, for example, will thus

        III.      By A. W. Ilormaxn, LL.D., 1“.R.S.                 Received September
        7, 1867.
    The new cyanides isomeric with the nitriles, which                I have described in
two previous communications,             are not formed exclusively         by the action
of chloroform on the primary monamines.                     On perusing     the papers de
scribing the examination of the organic cyanides,                 we see at a glance that
the chemists who investigated them have had in their hands at the same
time the isomeric cyanides with which               I am engaged.
    In fact everyone who has distilled mixtures of sulphornethylate,                 sulph
ethylate,     or   sulphamylate      of  potassium     with    the cyanide    of the   same
meta],    will   remember    the  repulsive    odour  possessed by    the  products so ob
tained.     This odour only disappears in proportion as the product is puri
<U+FB01>ed, and especially after its treatment with acid, in order to remove the
ammonia, and with oxide of mercury to separate the hydrocyanic acid.
    Dumas, Malaguti, and Le Blane, in their researches on the nitriles, men
tion the insupportable          odour possessed by the cyanides obtained by the
 cyanide-of-potassium process ; while the products obtained by the dehydra
 tion of the ammoniacal salts by means of phosphoric anhydride have a very
 agreeable aromatic odour.

      In  a research made by Mr. Buckton and myself on the transformations
  of   the amides and nitriles under the in<U+FB02>uence of sulphuric acid, we re
 peatedly     had occasion    to prepare acetonitrilc (cyanide of methyl) and
  propionitrile (cyanide     of ethyl) by the distillation of a sulphomethyiate or
  sulphethylate with cyanide of potassium.            In our paper we mention sub
  stances of a formidable odour which appeared in these reactions, and we
  describe the efforts we made in order to isolate them. But as they are only
  formed in small quantity, we had to give up the attempt.
      Mr. E.Meyer*, who has also been occupied with cyanide of ethyl,but who
  employed another method of preparation, encountered the same bodies. By
  acting on cyanide of silver with iodide of ethyl in sealed tubes, he obtained,
  together with iodide of silver, an unstable compound of cyanide of silver
  and cyanide of ethyl; and there was formed in the same reaction a liquid
  of an overwhelming odour.          This latter, on distillation, presented the cha—
  racters of a mixture from which it was impossible to isolate a product with
  a constant   boiling-point.    When treated with an acid the odour disappeared,
  and the solution contained ethylamiue          which was identi<U+FB01>ed by the analysis
  of the platinum-salt.        These   are certainly     the characters of the cyanides
  formed by the action of chloroform on the primary monamines; and it can
  not be doubted that      Mr. Meyer has had in his hands the ethyl-term of the
  series of cyanides which      I am studying, both in the combination with cya
  nide of silver and in the complex liquid which accompanied it.
      If such results did not particularly attract            the attention of chemists,
  it was owing to the fact that the author failed            in ascertaining the comple
  mentary product of ethylamine, namely, formic              acid.     Mr. Meyer, besides,
   states that his research remained un<U+FB01>nished;              and thus it will be under—
   stood how experiments otherwise so carefully carried out should have fallen
   into an oblivion from which neither the author nor any other chemist has
   endeavoured to recal them during the many years which have elapsed since
   their publication.
       In consequence of the examination of the bodies produced by the action
   of chloroform on the primary monamines, these old experiments have ac
   quired a new interest; and it appeared to me, for more than one reason,
   that it would be desirable to repeat them, making use of the experience
   gained by my late researches.
       For this purpose     I have submitted      cyanide of silver        to the action of
   several organic iodides.
       The iodides of methyl and ethyl act very slowly on cyanide of silver at
   the ordinary temperature;        but the reaction takes place at the temperature
I
    of boiling water.
       After a digestion of about ten hours, the transformation is complete; a
   brown solid matter is formed, having the appearance of paracyanogen, to
    gether with a yellowish oily layer possessing in a marked manner the odour
    of the isomers of the nitriles.

 152              Dr. Hofmann        on a   New Series of Bodies               [Recess ,
     As several preliminary experiments gave indications of a rather com
 plicated reaction, and as it would have been di<U+FB02>icult for me readily to
  obtain suf<U+FB01>cient substance by operating in sealed tubes,             I performed the
  experiment    in  the  amylic   series,  supposing  that   the   higher  boiling-point
 of the iodide of amyl would render it more easy of attack. My expectation
 was indeed ful<U+FB01>lled: two molecules of cyanide of silver and one molecule
  of iodide of amyl act on one another with extreme violence at the boiling
 point of the latter.      It is convenient to operate on a moderate scale, so as
 to be carefully protected from the escaping gases, which consist of equal
 volumes of amylene and hydrocyanic acid, mixed with a small quantity of the
  cyanide of amyl.
     The experiment was made in a retort adapted to the lower end of a
 condenser, the upper end of which was connected with a series of wash
 ing-bottles.     In the <U+FB01>rst a small quantity of cyanide of amyl was con
 densed;    the second contained water intended to absorb the hydrocyanic
 acid; the third one water and bromine in order to transform the amylenc
 into bromide, of which I was thus enabled to collect a considerable
 quantity    during my researches.
     After an hour’s digestion, the reaction is <U+FB01>nished, and the residue in
 the retort consists of a dark viscous mass, becoming almost solid on cool
 ing; this is a mixture of iodide of silver and a combination of cyanide of
 silver and cyanide of amyl.          The reaction then takes place according to
 the equation    :—

This secondary transformation          depends principally on the manner in which
 the operation is conducted; it may give rise to very great loss if the re
action be rather tumultuous.
    It  was now necessary to separate the cyanide        of amyl from the residue in
the retort.    Up   to the  present  time   I have found   no other means of effecting
this than by submitting the residue to dry distillation ; in this operation a
further quantity of hydrocyanic acid and amylene is disengaged, and a_
liquid distils over, which on recti<U+FB01>cation boils between 50° and 200°.               By
submitting it to fractional distillation it was found that the <U+FB01>rst part still
contained a quantity of amylene, whilst the latter products had become
inodorous.      The intermediate portion, recti<U+FB01>ed several times, <U+FB01>nally exhi
bited a constant boiling-point
                                     between 135° and 137°.

    The liquid which distils at this temperature is perfectly pure cyanide of
amyl.      it possesses all the properties which I have described in my pre
vious    communication,      and is characterized especially by its odour and by
the facility with which, under the in<U+FB02>uence of hydrochloric acid, it splits
into formic acid and amylamine.          I  have not yet completely examined the
products boiling at a higher temperature, but everything seems to show
that they consist, partly at least, of capronitrile.
    The experiments which        I have just described show, in a positive man
ner, that the same bodies can be obtained by the action of chloroform on
the primary monamines, and by the treatment of cyanide of silver with the
alcoholic iodides.      In the latter process many secondary products are ob
tained; but by a more complete study perhaps it may be modi<U+FB01>ed so as
to diminish their quantity.
    However this may be, the study of the action of the alcoholic iodides upon
silver-salts deserves to be resumed; and it is very probable that in many cases
it will be found that the bodies so produced will be but      I
                                                                isomeric with those
obtained by the ordinary processes.
    For the special researches in which 1 am engaged at the present time, the
observations just described have a particular interest; they permit us, in
fact, to produce the isomeric cyanides without <U+FB01>rst preparing the primary
monamines; they are especially important with reference to the generation
of the polycyanides.         The polyamines, in fact, are little, if at all, known
up to the present, whilst the iodides of methylene and ethylene and iodo
form are easy to procure.
    If  I have not yet succeeded         in   preparing  a dicyanide    of ethylene,
C, H, N,, isomeric with Mr. Maxwell Simpson’s              cyanide, it is because   I
have not had at my disposal a suf<U+FB01>cient quantity of ethylene-diamine.               I
now hope to obtain this bodyr by submitting               cyanide of silver to the
action of iodide of ethylene.
    In conclusion, I may be permitted to announce as very probable the ex
istence of a series of bodies isomeric with the sulphocyanides.             Already
Mr. Cloez has shown that the action of chloride of cyanogen on ethylate of
potassium gives rise to the formation of an ethylic cyanate possessing pro
perties absolutely     different from those belonging to the cyanate discovered
by   Mr. Wurtz.       On comparing, on the other hand, the properties of the
methylic and ethylic sulphocyanides with those of the sulphocyanides of
allyl and phenyl, we can scarcely doubt that we have here the representatives
of two groups entirely different, and that the terms of the methylic and
ethylic series, which correspond to oil of mustard and to the sulphocyanide
of phenyl, still remain to be discovered. Experiments with which I am now
engaged will show whether these bodies can be obtained by the action of the
iodides of methyl and ethyl on sulphocyanide of silver.
    I must not conclude this note without expressing my thanks to Messrs.
Sell and Pinner for the hearty cooperation that they are giving me in
these researches.

   The elimination tables in the memoir on the Resultant of a System of
two Equations (Phil. Trans. 1857, pp. 703—715), relate to equations of the
form (a, b . . :(m, y)“=0, without numerical coef<U+FB01>cients;      but it is,          I
think, desirable to give the corresponding tables for equations in the form
(a, b.. Irv, 3/)“:0, with numerical coef<U+FB01>cients, which is the standard
form in quantics.   The transformation can of course be effected without
dif<U+FB01>culty, and the results are as here given.  It is easy to see dpriorz' that
the sum of the numerical coef<U+FB01>cients in each table ought to vanish ; these
sums do in fact vanish, and we have thus a verification as well of the tables
of the present addition as of the tables of the original memoir, by means
whereof the present tables were calculated.

   "The  aldehyde of the methyl-series is not known ;    all the chemical
manuals say so, and for the last twenty years my students have been duly
informed thereof.  It will scarcely appear strange that more e<U+FB02>'orts to be
come acquainted   with that body should not have been made, since the
masterly picture which Liebig has delineated of the aldehyde par excellence
embraced as it were the history of the whole class, and of course also of
the aldehyde    in question.  Nevertheless       methylic aldehyde deserves our
consideration   for more than one reason;        As one of the simplest terms of
the monocarbon-series,    occupying    a position   intermediate   between marsh
gas and carbonic acid, as a    link of transition
                                             connecting methylic alcohol
and formic acid, as either aldehyde or acetone, according to the point of
view from which we look upon          the compound (3}an illustrates
                                           itI                                 a
greater variety of relations than any one of the higher aldehydes.   But in
addition to the interest with which the methyl-compound     has thus always
been invested, this substance possesses special claims upon our attention at
the present moment.      Our actual method of treating organic chemistry for
 the purposes of instruction almost involves the necessity of starting from
 the methyl-series.   The simplest of aldehydes thus acquires quite an espe
 cial importance, and all those who, like the author of this note, are engaged
 in teaching, cannot fail to have sadly missed     conlpound which
                                                    a                   the car

 rier of such varied and  interesting considerations.
    The desire which have frequently felt in my lectures of developing the
                     I
idea of' the genus aldehyde, when speaking of the methyl-compounds,          has

 more than once induced me to attempt the preparation of methyl-aldehyde,
 but it was only at the conclusion of my last summer course that succeeded,  I
 to  a certain extent at      all events, in attaining the object of my wishes.
     A  substance possessing the composition and the properties of methylic
 aldehyde is formed with surprising facility if a current of atmospheric air,
 charged     with the vapour of methylic         alcohol, be directed upon an incan
 descent plutinum        spiral.
    The bottom of         a strong three-necked       bottle, of two litres’ capacity, is
 covered to the height of about <U+FB01>ve centimetres with moderately warm me
 thylie alcohol.       The <U+FB01>rst neck is provided with a tube descending to the
 very surface of the liquid; into the second is <U+FB01>xed a loosely-<U+FB01>tting cork,
 which carries the platinum spiral ; the third one, lastly, communicates with
the upper end of a condenser, the lower end of which is fastened into a two
 necked receiver.       This receiver is in its turn connected with a series of wash
bottles, and the last of these communicates with a water-jet uspirator, by
which a current of air can be sucked through the whole system.
    The apparatus being disposed in this manner, the platinum spiral is
heated to redness and introduced into the three-necked bottle.                   After a
few minutes the <U+FB02>ameless combustion of the methyl-alcohol begins to mani
fest itself by the evolution of a vapour powerfully affecting the nose and
eyes.     Gradually the temperature of the apparatus rises, and soon droplets
of   a colourless    liquid are condensed in the receiver. The formation of
methyl-aldehyde         is now fairly proceeding, and if the current of air be
appropriately adjusted, the platinum spiral remains incandescent for hours
and even for days.           There is no dif<U+FB01>culty in collecting from 50 to 100
grammes      of a liquid    rather  rich in methyl-aldehyde.
    Instead of establishing the current of air by a water-jet aspirator, apair
of bellows may be conveniently employed.                I have often used with advan
tage the bellows of an ordinary glass-blowing table.                This mode of pro
ceeding    is more particularly adapted         to  the  requirements of the lecturer,
who is thus enabled, by simply accelerating the movement of the foot, to
enliven the combustion, so as to keep the whole spiral in a state of incan
descence.      By thus proceeding it happens, however, occasionally that the
gaseous    mixture     in the three-necked bottle is <U+FB01>red; but these explosions
are perfectly harmless, the whole effect being the forcible ejection of the
loosely-<U+FB01>tting cork which carries the platinum spiral.
    The liquid which is being collected in the receiver has all the properties
which theory assigns to the aldehyde of the methyl-series, or, more properly
speaking, to its methyl-alcoholic solution.           When rendered slightly alkaline
by a few drops of ammonia, and mixed with nitrate of silver, it yields, on
gently warming, :1 silver mirror of irreproachable perfection, which is in
deed morc readily and more certainly produced than with the aldehyde
of the ethyl-series.         The reduction in this case is the result of two conse
cutive reactions     ;  in the <U+FB01>rst stage the aldehyde       yields  formic acid, which
in the second stage is converted into water and carbonic acid.
                                                                           N 2

158                  Dr. Hofmann      on   Methylic Aldehyde.            [New 21,
    On heating the methyl-alcoholic         solution of the aldehyde with a few
drops of a <U+FB01>xed alkali, the liquid becomes turbid on ebullition, acquires a
yellowish coloration, and soon deposits droplets of a brownish oil, possess
ing in the highest degree the peculiar odour of ethyl-aldehyde-resin.
    After the observation which I have mentioned, it was scarcely doubtful
that the product of the slow combustion of methylic alcohol contained the
aldehyde of this alcohol in considerable proportion.            Nevertheless it ap
peared necessary to <U+FB01>x the nature of this compound by some numbers.
The commencement of the vacations being at hand, there was but little
hope of preparing the liquid in suf<U+FB01>cient quantity for the purpose of
obtaining the aldehyde, which will probably be found to be either gaseous
at the common temperature or extremely volatile, in a state of purity for
analysis. Under these circumstances        I  have been compelled to limit myself
to the preparation of an easily accessible derivative of methyl-aldehyde
possessing a characteristic composition, and the analysis of which would
not be less conclusive than that of the aldehyde itself.       The slight solubility
and the powerfully crystalline tendencies of the sulphaldehyde of the ethyl
series could not fail to indicate the direction in which      I had a right to hope
that the object which I was aiming at might be accomplished.
    If a current of sulphuretted hydrogen be passed through the methyl-alco
holic solution of methyl-aldehyde, the liquid becomes turbid after a few
minutes, and on allowing the saturated solution to stand for some hours,
a body    of an alliaccous odour begins to be separated at the bottom of the
<U+FB02>ask.     If  the liquid be now mixed with half its volume of concentrated
hydrochloric acid, and heated to ebullition, it becomes limpid, and solidi—
<U+FB01>es on cooling into a mass of felted needles of dazzling whiteness.           These
needles fuse at 218°; they are volatile without decomposition.              Slightly
soluble in water, they are more readily dissolved by alcohol, and still more
so by ether.       For the purpose of analysis they were recrystallized from
 boiling water, in order to exclude free sulphur, with which they might have
possibly been contaminated.           The numbers obtained in the analysis of
the crystals unmistakeably establish their nature.           The white crystals, as
 might have been expected, have the composition of the sulphaldehyde of
 the methyl-series,                     CH2 S.
    The analysis of the sulphur-compound           <U+FB01>xes, of course, the presence of
 the corresponding oxygen, compound among the products of the slow com
                                            '
 bustion of methylic alcohol.
    A  more minute      examination    of methylic aldehyde and its derivatives
 remains still to be made.        It  will be absolutely necessary to isolate the
 oxygen-term and to determine its vapour-density, in order to ascertain its
 molecular weight.       If we remember the facility with which the aldehydes
 are polimerized,    the question presents itself, whether the aldehyde formed
 by the slow combustion of methylic alcohol is represented by the formula
                                        CH2 0,
 or a multiple thereof.     A  similar remark applies to the sulphur-derivative.

  It  deserves, moreover,      to be mentioned that a compound isomeric with
 methylic aldehyde, the dioxymethylene (C2 H, 02) of M. Boutlerow, is
 known already; also that a sulphur-compound of the formula

 purpose,    if p05sible, of isolating methylic aldehyde in a state of purity, and
 of thus completing this inquiry.

        ROBINSON, F.R.S.           Received October 15, 1867.
                                            Observatory, Armagh, October 14, 1867.
     My DEAR FRIEND,-—AS           you express a wish to know my recent impres
 sions respecting the great telescope, I can say that they are very satisfac
 tory. When        I saw it six weeks ago the <U+FB01>rst of the two great specula was
just polished;       and though the essential parts of the cquatoreal were in
 position,   and  one  could estimate the facility with which it could be managed,
 the optical part of the telescope remained incomplete.          Now,    I found the
 great and small specula in their places, a <U+FB01>nder of four inches aperture at
 tached, the circles divided,        and the clock for driving the telescope en
 shrined    in the pier.     One thing was wanting, weather <U+FB01>t for trying its
 power; and during eighteen nights there was only one of even middling
 goodness.      That, however, was suf<U+FB01>cient to prove that the instrument is
 thoroughly up to its intended work. I examined several nebulae and
 clusters, with whose appearance in Lord Rosse’s six-feet re<U+FB02>ector I am
 familiar, and the di<U+FB01>'ereuce was far less than I expected.           I may specify
 among them 51 Messier, whose spirals were seen on strong aurora, and the

 nition of stars is very good: a Lyra: had as small and sharp an image as            I
ever saw on such a night;          and a few pretty close double stars were well
 and clearly     separated.     Part of this is probably due to the lattice-tube,
which permits the escape of heated air, but more to the <U+FB01>gure of the spe
culum,     which is truly parabolic.       The peculiar nature of the mounting
brings the circles completely within reach of the observer’s assistant; and
the mechanical appliances for the motions in right ascension and polar
distance are so perfect, that we set the instrument on the faint objects which
we were examining with great facility and rapidity.           One man can reverse
the telescope in a minute        and  a quarter; the  quick motion  in polar distance
is of course for easier, and the slow one acts more like the tangent screw of

 a circle than the mover      of such a huge mass.      The clock is rather gigantic,
 but  does its    work with great precision, the objects which         I  examined re
 maining steady on the wire as long as I watched them; and there is an
 ingenious and new contrivance for suiting its speed to planets or the moon.
 There remain but a few matters to be completed ; the second great specu
 lum is nearly polished, the glass small one is ready ; the micrometer and
 observing-chair     are not commenced, nor the photographic apparatus and
 spectroscope.       These two last are no part of Mr. Grubb’s contract; but
 the Committee       thought themselves justi<U+FB01>ed by the correspondence in order
 ing them, as their cost is small, and they will add greatly to the utility of
 the telescope.      In the <U+FB01>ne sky of Melbourne it will, I trust, yield spectro
 scopic results surpassing any that have as yet been obtained *.               That it
 will realize fully the expectations of the people whose enlightened liberality
 has ordered its construction I am quite certain; but I am not so certain
 that it will retain its present perfection very long if exposed without some
 shelter.    It is true that Mr. Cooper’s great achromatic has stood exposed
 to the rain and wind of Connaught for more than thirty years, and is still
 serviceable ; but besides its inferior size it is of coarser workmanship, and
is provided with fewer of those beautiful contrivances which in this instru
 ment make its movements so easy.            At Melbourne the rain of Markree is
not to be feared ; but if one may judge from its position on the verge of a
great continent, and from the analogy of India and the Cape, another enemy
is to be dreaded, the <U+FB01>ne dust which winds from the interior will probably
bring. This would <U+FB01>nd its way into all the bearings, and besides clogging
their action would grind them out of truth. The danger of this induces
me, after careful discussion with Messrs. Le Sueur and the two Grubbs, to
lay before you my views, which (if you think them sound) you may hold
it advisable to mention to the authorities of Victoria.
   Three modes occur to me of covering the telescope.              In any case it must
be surrounded by a wall, for the comfort of the observer and to prevent in
trusion. This wall may support a moveable covering of such a kind as to
let the instrument be pointed to every part of the sky.
   The most usual form of this covering is a dome running on a circular
railway, and with an opening or. chase on one side reaching from its base
to its summit, and closed by a sliding shutter.           The disadvantages of this
plan are, that the performance of the telescope is somewhat injured by cur
rents of warm air rising through the chase, and that it is much heavier and
more costly than either of the others.          In this instance its diameter could
not be less than 56 feet; and though that magnitude is not beyond the
resources of an accomplished engineer, yet it is not one to be encountered
without the prospect of some adequate advantage. The largest dome which
I know (Sir James South’s, of 36 feet diameter) is a total failure; but this
does not weigh much with me—for, though planned by the celebrated
Brunel, it transgresses against the elements of mechanical science.

     A  much simpler plan is the sliding roof.           In this case the walls are rec
tangular, enclosing      a  space  rather   broader   than   the instrument, and about
three times as long.          The longer sides carry two rails, on which runs a
kind of house long enough to cover the instrument and pier, and high
 enough to clear the latter.        That end which at Melbourne will be its north
 is closed by doors, which are opened at the time of observation, and the
 roof is wheeled away, leaving all in the open air.              It will be the cheapest
 and least bulky of the three.           Its defects are, that the open end presents
 some engineering difficulty, that the roof will hide about 12° under the
 pole, and that the whole machinery is exposed to any dust that may be
 stirring during the hours of observing.
     That which appears the best is the revolving roof.               Its vertical part is
 a   prism of sixteen sides, six feet high, springing from a ring of cast iron,
 which revolves by rollers on a circular rail borne by the wall. The top is
 nearly <U+FB02>at, with a chase large enough to let the telescope work freely,
 which can be covered by sliding shutters.             The tube, when in use, would
 project     through the chase, and        be  essentially  in free air, at other times
 could    be lowered    and completely sheltered; while the other parts would
 be as well protected as under a dome.             In this case the internal diameter
 should     be about 46 feet,  with  a chase 16 feet wide.      These dimensions would
 give complete command of the heavens, and such a roof would give less
  hold to a high wind than either of the others.               I enclose a rough sketch
  of its  framing.     The panels and the three girders at the top to be of angle
 iron, light but strong, and these covered with tin plate.            If it were adopted,
  I  suppose the frame would be made here, sent out in pieces, and put to
  gether and covered on its arrival.            The weight would be about 5 tons.
  As to its    cost, no estimate can   be   given, as labour costs more at Melbourne
  than with us ; but in Ireland it would be about if 1200.
      I will conclude this long letter by telling you how much I am satis<U+FB01>ed
  with our selection of the astronomer who is to work this glorious instru
  ment.      He is not a mere mathematician ; such a one might be very help
  less when he came to the practical details of observing, but he is the
  roughly versed in its optical and mechanical requirements, and in the daily
  work of an observatory.         For this last he has been trained by Professor
  Adams during the past year; one of the Committee, Mr. Warren De la
   Rue, the <U+FB01>rst of celestial photographers, has instructed him in the mys
  teries of that surprising art; and for the last three months he has been
   constantly in Mr. Grnbb's works, studying all the mechanism of the tele
   scope (of which I see he has acquired full command), and taking an active
  part in the polishing of the great specula.             He seems fully to understand
  this most delicate process ; and it is my opinion that, if repolishing becomes
  necessary, he is fully competent to do it successfully.
      I may therefore congratulate you in full hope on the inestimable harvest
   of discovery and triumph which will soon crown this magni<U+FB01>cent enter
   prise.                                     Yours ever,                           .

       MY L0nn,—I      have the honour to acquaint your Lordship that two
shocks       of earthquake were felt here at 5% on the afternoon of the 19th
instant, and again on the following morning, after an interval of twelve
hours.   The latter shock was severe, and lasted about ten seconds. The
oscillations    were horizontal,    and appeared to proceed from east to west.
Several houses have been cracked         and otherwise damaged, and one of the
old Venetian galley-arches fell sideways in            a block,     killing   a   Turkish sentry
and a hospital attendant.    A remarkable phenomenon occurred that morn
ing soon after the earthquake.     The sea receded at the rate of about ten
inches per minute, until, attaining a maximum depression of some four feet,
it gradually rose again above its former level.  The water in the wells was
affected in the same degree, and on rising it became much agitated.      At
 53}A.M. the sea-water was tepid, with    temperature of 87° (Fahr.), being
                                                   a
equal to that of the air.
   The morning was unusually still and sultry, and        was not until the
                                                                      it
afternoon that the sea subsided into its normal     condition, tempered by                      a
cool northerly breeze.       A
                           strong eddy  had  set in, causing much damage to
shipping, several of the smaller craft parting their cables and coming into
collision with each other.    \Vith reference to the state of the sea,                     it   is
worthy of note that the copper-bottom of Her Majesty’s Ship ‘Wizard,’
now      this port, became suddenly clean and bright.

164                            Anniversary Meeting.                         [NOV- 30,
    The President then addressed the Society            as follows :—
       GENTLEMEN,
THE     year which has passed since          I last addressed you has been to us a
mournfully eventful One.        Death has taken from us three of our most emi
nent and respected Members.             Two were my predecessors in this Chair,
for whom, only a few months            ago, we might well have heped. that many
years   of useful life were  yet   in  store.    In regard to the third, the declin
ing health of Faraday (one of the greatest names in our annals) for a
considerable time forbade such hope in his case.
    Whilst you deplore with me the losses we have sustained, you will be
prepared to read with strong interest the biographical notices of these dis
tinguished men, which are very shortly to appear in our obituary.                 It is
well that I am able to announce that these will be so soon in your hands,
for even the feeble attempt       on my part to do justice to such a theme on
this occasion, which might       otherwise have been expected of me (altogether
inadequate as it must have       been), would have occupied the greater part, if
not the whole, of the time       claimed by our more ordinary topics.
    I pass therefore at once to the relation of the action taken by the Royal
Society in the promotion of science in the past year.
    At  the last Anniversary I gave an account of the progress made up to
that time in printing the Catalogue of Scienti<U+FB01>c Papers.              I am happy now
to be able to announce that the <U+FB01>rst volume lies before us ready for publi
cation.     It comprehends a portion of the' <U+FB01>rst part of the Catalogue, in
which the titles    are arranged      alphabetically,    according to authors’ names,
and extends from A to Clu.            An explanatory Preface and Introduction are
pre<U+FB01>xed, as is also a list of the periodical works from which the titles have
been extracted, with the abbreviations under which they are referred to.               I
need scarcely remind you how often the appearance of the <U+FB01>rst volume of a
series is necessarily subject to delays not incident to the succeeding volumes.
This has happened in the present case; and we may now con<U+FB01>dently anti
cipate that the work will progress rapidly and uninterruptedly.                You are
 aware that the work is being printed at Her Majesty’s Stationery O<U+FB02>ice,
and that arrangements will be made, with the approval of the Government,
 for distributing a certain number of copies as presents to scienti<U+FB01>c institu
tions and other parties, while the remainder will be offered for sale at such
a price as may defray the cost of printing.
    The attention of the President and Council has continued to be much
occupied during the past year in aiding, at the request of Her Majesty’s
 Government, in the reorganization of the meteorological department of the
Board of Trade, and in preparing the preliminary arrangements of a
 system of British Land-Meteorology to be carried out under the authoriza
 tion of that Board.
    In  my Anniversary     Address of last year,      I  brought before you, as fully as

1867.]                        President’s Address.                        165
the time at our command would permit, the reasons which had in<U+FB02>uenced
both the Government and the Royal Society in desiring the establishment
in this country of meteorological observatories conducted on a systematic
plan, and directed towards the attainment of a more perfect knowledge of
the meteorology of our country than we at present possess.
    The scheme, which, at the instance of the Board of Trade, had been sug
 gested by the President and Council, consisted in the establishment of six
or seven observatories, well distributed over the area of the British Islands,
furnished with self-recording instruments on the pattern of those devised
 and in use at the Kew Observatory,      and transmitting their records of the
 temperature, pressure, electric and hygrometric state of the atmosphere,
 and of the direction and force of the wind to a. central of<U+FB01>ce, where (under
the general superintendence of a committee of scienti<U+FB01>c men) they should
 undergo the processes of reduction and combination, and be applied to the
 general study of the phenomena.
    The Government, actingwith due caution, determined on submitting
 this suggestion, as well as, generally, the functions of the meteorological
 department of the Board of Trade as' it had previously existed, to a com
 mittee of scienti<U+FB01>c and practical men to be nominated by the Government
 itself, the Royal Society being invited to name one of the members.
    The suggestion to which I have adverted, of the establishment of a
 small number of meteorological observatories supplied with self-recording
 instruments for the purpose of making a full, accurate, and continuous
 record of meteorological phenomena at certain selected stations, appears to
 have received the unquali<U+FB01>ed and emphatic approval of the committee, and
 to have been viewed by them as the most effectual means of supplying a
 secure and adequate basis for the discussion of the variations of the weather
 in the British Islands. Self-recording instruments are spoken of in the
 report as likely to prove of eminent local and international utility; it is
 anticipated that the establishment of observatories furnished with them in
  England may be expected to confer a wide bene<U+FB01>t, that they would give
 precision and fulness to the charts of our own weather, and would set an
  example   that foreign governments would probably soon follow, and that
  they would    afford material in a very acceptable form to meteorologists at
  home and abroad for the discussion of weather phenomena.
     The Board of Trade, after reference to the Admiralty and to the Trea
  sury, adopted the Report of their Committee in a
                                                        “ Circular” dated No
  vember 29th, 1866; and at the same time asked the Royal Society whether
  they would be willing to name a committee of their own members to give
  their gratuitous services in the organization of the observatories recom
  mended, and in the general superintendence of the Meteorological         De
  partment.
     The public service thus requested was unhesitatingly undertaken ; and
  on the 13th of December, 1866, a committee was named of eight of the
  Fellows of the Royal Society who were willing to devote themselves to
  the onerous and responsible duties of such an undertaking. Estimates

were required, and were furnished by them, of the probable            cost of the
organization, and of the annual expense of the Observatories.        In August of
the present year (186.7) the estimates were passed in the House of Com
mons ; and I have now the satisfaction of announcing, on the part of the
Committee,      that they have reason to believe that in January 1868, being
not more than six months after the passing of the estimates, Observa—
tories supplied with self-recording instruments which have been prepared
and veri<U+FB01>ed at Kew, working under competent superintendence, and with
a trained staff at each Observatory, will have commenced their observa
tions at Falmouth, Kew, Stonyhurst, Armagh, and Glasgow, and that there
is ground of expectation that, in a month or two later, Valentin and Aber
deen will be added to the list.
     The estimates passed in August 1867 will have defrayed the expenses of
organization and maintenance of these seven Observatories until the 3lst
of March 1868 (the close of the present <U+FB01>nancial year). The continuance
Of the Observatories must necessarily depend upon the disposition of
 Government to recommend, and of the House of Commons to supply, the
necessary funds.       The Superintendirig Committee of the Royal Society are
prepared for either alternative, viz. either to continue their general super
intendence, or to regard their honourable and laborious undertaking as ter
 minated.      In the former case, it will become their of<U+FB01>ce to trace the
 variations of the weather, as presented in the continuous and well-distri
 buted records over the area of the British Islands, viewed in conjunction
 with the telegrams from the Ports and with the information received from
 other countries, and thus so to contribute to a knowledge of the laws
 which govern those variations as to enable meteorologists gradually, and as
 far as may be possible, to place the practice of forecasting the weather on a
 sound and dependable basis.
     The Report of the Committee of the Board of Trade contains many valu
  able suggestions regarding the treatment which the information          accumu
 lated in the of<U+FB01>ce of the meteorological department of that Board should
 undergo, with the view of extracting       from it the information it is capable
 of affording    on the meteorological  statistics of the Ocean, and specially of
  the parts most frequented by British ships.        This great branch of meteo
 rological   research,  so eminently be<U+FB01>tting a great maritime and commer
  cial nation, was most prominently urged on the consideration of Her Ma
 jesty’s Government by the President and Council of the Royal Society in
  a letter dated February 22, 1855 ; and in the subsequent establishment of
  the Meteorological    Department   of the Board of Trade it was recognized as
 being one of the chief functions of the. office so constituted.    The collection
  of a very considerable mass of information, embodied in the logs of ships
  to which instruments      and instructions have been supplied, has been the
  result ; but comparatively little advance appears to have been made in the
  labour of extracting,_ collating, combining, and discussing the valuable
  materials   thus obtained.    The work, both of collecting     further informa
  tion» and   of discussing and arranging for communication      to the public the

   information already in the of<U+FB01>ce and that which may hereafter be obtained,
  has been resumed under the general superintendence of the Meteorological
  Committee      of the Royal Society, pro<U+FB01>ting by the valuable suggestions
  contained    in the Report of the Committee of the Board of Trade. This
  forms the second portion of the duties which they have taken upon them
  selves.    A third portion consists in the endeavour to make available for
  the bene<U+FB01>t of mariners the information which reaches the of<U+FB01>ce by tele
  graph early in the day as to the state of the weather at different points of
  the coast.                                                       .
     A  copy of this information       is transmitted,  by the <U+FB01>rst post after its
                                                                     '    '      '
  reception, to any port which desires to receive it.
     If  the authorities at any port require any special       telegraphic intelli
 gence, it is furnished to them without unnecessary delay, on their agree
 ing to defray half the cost of transmission of the message, and stating the
 precise nature of the information required.
     Lastly, the Committee are prepared to convey, free of cost, telegraphic
 intelligence of the existence of any serious atmospherical disturbance which
may have come to their knowledge, to all ports to which it appears to
 them that such information would be of importance.              Such a telegram
may     be, for  example    :—
                 “ Storm from West at Penzance and South coast."
     On the receipt of such a message the local authorities are expected to
hoist a drum as a general warning, on seeing which masters of vessels or
other interested persons may learn by inquiry at the local of<U+FB01>ce (or by
other arrangements) the precise nature of the information received, toge
 ther with any additional particulars which may have been transmitted
 from the central of<U+FB01>ce.
     It is clearly understood by all parties that any telegraphic message of a
 warning nature (like the example here mentioned) is merely meant to
imply that there is a serious atmospherical disturbance existing along a
 certain region of coast, and consequently that there is, or may be, dangaf
 impending in other districts.
     Some such arrangement as that which has been now described was the
subject of early discussion between the Board of Trade and the Committee
of   the Royal Society.       The arrangement as adopted was proposed by the
Committee       in a letter  dated the 8th of June, being some weeks before the
estimates     had passed, and consequently before they were authorized to
incur any expenditure whatever on the public account.            It has been since
approved by the Board of Trade, and is now in operation.
     The telegraphic messages, which are now limited to a notice of         “ exist
ing facts,” are obviously capable of extension hereafter, in proportion as
the basis upon which sound meteorological anticipations may rest shall be
enlarged; and this we may reasonably hope for, as one of the fruits of the
establishment      and action of the   “ Land  Meteorological Observatories.”
     Meantime     a not   unimportant preliminary measure has received its due
 consideration.       From an early period the attention of the Committee had
                                                                      P 2

been drawn to the importance       of improving, as far as possible, the quality
of the intelligence received from the coast stations.      With this view they
gave directions   that all  the  telegraph   stations at which observations are
made should be inspected—a practice which had never before been carried
out.   The inspection of all the stations situated in the British Islands has
now been completed.       It is hoped that, as the result of these measures, the
accuracy  and   consequent value of the reports received will be in future ma
terially improved; and such desirable improvement has indeed already been
in part e<U+FB01>'ected.
   The four-foot re<U+FB02>ector destined for the Melbourne Observatory ap
proaches its completion, with a full prospect of its being ready to proceed
to its destination early in the coming year, under the charge of Mr. Le
Sueur.    The spectroscope and photographic apparatus, which are to be
used with  it,are in progress.       question has arisen as to the expediency
                                     A
of providing     with some
                 it         roof  or_ covering
                                                which, while admitting-of the
telescope being directed to any part of the heavens, shall be an ef<U+FB01>cient
protection for    itfrom the weather at all times when not in actual use.
Three designs for this purpose, viz. a'dome, sliding roof, and revolving
                                                        a            a
roof, with the estimated cost of each, have been supplied by Mr. Grubb,
and have been sent to Melbourne to be submitted to the choice of the
Board of Visitors of the Observatory; their decision may be expected to
arrive very shortly, and Mr. Grnbb       isprepared to carry itinto effect with
all promptitude.     There  is therefore full reason to expect that this mag
ni<U+FB01>cent instrument will be at work in the splendid <U+FB01>eld which awaits its
operations, in the hands of      thoroughly skilled and competent observer,
                                 a
before our next Anniversary.
   The Superintending Committee, whose assistance in this important un
dertaking has been unremittingly given, have sustained          loss, which all
                                                                 a
who hear me will appreciate, in the lamented decease of the Earl of Rosse.
Deeply as the death of one so highly gifted, and who devoted his gifts to
such high objects,   to be deplored,
                       is                some consolation that his son
                                              it   is
and successor    one who will add to the lustre of their name.
                  is                                             He           is
already known to you by the important paper on the Nebula of Orion
which was read at the close of our last session, and now in course of

publication in the Philosophical Transactions.  This paper appears clearly
to show that, in the course of the last <U+FB01>fteen years, considerable changes
have taken place in that remarkable       object, such as cannot be attributed
either to atmospheric   di<U+FB01>iculties of vision, or changes in the instrument,
or in the observer’s eye. It con<U+FB01>rms fully the researches of Mr. Huggins,
and at the same time explains what had presented some dif<U+FB01>culty, the
absence of  a continuous spectrum when the telescope shows         multitude
                                                                     a

    1867.]                          President’s Address.                          169
   with the two surviving members, Dr. Robinson and Mr. De la Rue, and,
   in agreement with their recommendation, have named the present Earl of
                                                      -
   Rosse as their associate.
       The year 1868 will be signalized by the occurrence of a total solar
   eclipse of almost the greatest possible duration, a<U+FB01>'ording therefore more
   leisure than usual for such observations as can only be made during the
   brief interval of the totality. The total phase will be visible in India, but
   elsewhere only in countries practically unavailable. Recent observations on
   the spectra of the heavenly bodies render spectroscopic observations of the
  red protuberances and of the corona a matter of peculiar interest at
  the present time.        The President and Council have therefore considered
  how far they might contribute to a full use of so rare an opportunity in
  regard to these more especially physical phenomena.
      Having already experienced, in the case of the pendulum            experiments
  in India reported in my last year’s Address, the advantage of acting in concert
  with the distinguished of<U+FB01>cer who now holds the post of Superintendent of
  the Great Trigonometrical Survey, Colonel Walker of the Royal Engineers,
  and having ascertained his readiness to charge himself with the practical ar
  rangements which would be required for the observation of the eclipse, the
   President and Council determined on employing a portion of the Parlia
  mentary grant placed at their disposal for the present year in the prepara—
  tion of the necessary instruments, consisting of a telescope of <U+FB01>ve inches
  aperture,   by Messrs. Cooke and Sons, mounted as a portable equatoreal
 with clock      movement, and provided with a star spectroscope;             and as
  clouds might      interfere  with  the  observations  with this  instrument  at the
 critical moment,       they have added four direct spectroscopes for observing
  the general character of the spectra of the red protuberances and the
 corona, and have entrusted them to Colonel Walker, to be placed in the
 hands    of different   observers.
      It has happened fortunately that a son of Sir John Herschel, an assis
 tant in the Trigonometrical Survey, was about to return to India from
 leave of absence in this country, and, being applied to, expressed his
 readiness, subject to the approval of Colonel Walker, to undertake any
 desired share in the observations, and to make himself acquainted with,
 and receive instruction in, the use of the instruments        before his departure,
 as well as to take charge      of their conveyance to India.     This arrangement
having received the cordial approval of Colonel             Walker,   has been duly
proceeded with, and Lieutenant Herschel with the instruments is now on
his way to India.
     Mr. Hennessey, First Assistant on the Indian Trigonometrical Survey,
having expressed in a letter to the President his wish to render available
for scienti<U+FB01>c researches, not incompatible with his professional duties, his
residence for great part of the year at the elevated station and in the clear
atmosphere of Mussoorie (7000 feet above the sea), his offer, which had
received the cordial sanction of Colonel Walker, has been embraced:

170                               Anniversary Meeting.                      [Nov. 30,
advice and instructions for the observation of the terrestrial lines of the
solar spectrum, and for observations of the zodiaeal light (for which the
situation     is particularly favourable) and for other desirable inquiries have
been sent to him; and Lieutenant Herschel is taking out spectroscopes,
prisms, actinometers, and other suitable instruments which the Society
has provided for his use.
     The Society have been already apprised of the desire of the Government
of Mauritius to establish in that colony a Magnetical Observatory, working
 with the instruments and adopting the methods of discussing the results
as practised at Kew. Early in the
                                             Session a communication was received
 from    the  Colonial  Of<U+FB01>ce,   conveying  the   Earl of Carnarvon’s request for the
 opinion of the Royal Society regarding            the instruments  to be employed in,
 and the plans for the building of, a new           observatory,  which should be both
 magnetical and meteorological.           After     full communication   and discussion
 with Mr. Meldrum, Director of the                  Mauritius Observatory, who had
 arrived    in   England,   a reply  was  returned      to the Colonial Of<U+FB01>ce particu
 larizing the remaining        instruments   still   required for the complete equip
  ment of such an observatory, together              with  plans for the buildings and
  estimates for the whole, submitted by Mr. Meldrum, and approved by
  the President and Council.         The instruments have been prepared, veri<U+FB01>ed,
  and practised     with  by  Mr.   Meldrum,    at Kew, and are ready to proceed to
  their destination.
      The self-recording magnetical instruments prepared and veri<U+FB01>ed at the
  Kew Observatory by the request of the Government of Victoria have been
  forwarded to their destination, and are now at work at Melbourne under
  the superintendence of Mr. Ellery.           An application received in the course
       the present   year  from the same colony for self-recording meteorological
  of
  instruments on the pattern of those at Kew has been already complied
  with in part, and will be so fully as soon as the present urgent demands
  for the British Land Meteorological Observatories shall have been supplied.
      Since the information      conveyed in my last year’s Address respecting the
   Maguetical Observatory at Bombay, Mr. Chambers’s application for self
   recording instruments, similar to those at Kew, has been received at the India
   Of<U+FB01>ce, accompanied by the approval and recommendation of the Bombay
   Government.        Happening to arrive about the time when Lord Cranbourne
   had referred the general subject of the Astronomical Observatories in
   India to the Astronomer Royal, the Magnetical Observatory at Bombay
   was included in the reference, the distinction between astronomical and
   magnetical observatories not being perhaps very clearly understood.               Mr.
    Chambers’s application for ef<U+FB01>cient instruments seems, however, to have
    dropped out of consideration, and (to use an ordinary term) was “shelved.”
    A renewal of    the application made through Sir Bartle Frere, the Governor
    of Bombay,      caused a second reference to the Astronomer Royal, from

  1867.]                            President’s Address.                           1 71
 whose of<U+FB01>cial        reply, printed  by the Bombay      Government,    I extract   the
 following passage :—
     “I   should     certainly recommend     that any new magnetic observatory be
 furnished with magnetic instruments on the pattern of those at Kew.                  I
 would propose that an answer of this tenor be given to the Superintendent
 of the Bombay Observatory, that the Secretary of State for India in
 Council, having taken the opinion of the Astronomer Royal, approves
 highly of his (the Superintendent’s)           acting in concert with the Kew Ob
 servatory.”
    Still, possibly      from  inadvertence,   Mr. Chambers’s application for the
                  required to enable him to obey the instruction of
                                                                           “
instruments                                                                  acting in
concert with Kew” yet remains without a reply.                 In the meantime the
cost of the observatory runs on, whilst the very valuable services for mag
netical    science, approved       and recommended      by the Astronomer Royal,
and which        Mr. Chambers, having         been educated at Kew, is singularly
quali<U+FB01>ed      to carry into execution, are in abeyance for want of the ne
cessary instrumental means to execute them, the whole cost of which would
be under £400. We may hope that this oversight will shortly be recti<U+FB01>ed.
    The publication in the last year of the veri<U+FB01>cation and extension of La
Caille’s Arc of the Meridian in Southern Africa, by Sir Thomas Maclear,
Astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope, announces the completion of a na
tional work, pursued unremittingly for above thirty years, and establishing
by its result a conclusion too important in its scienti<U+FB01>c interest to pass with
out recognition by the Royal Society.             Our sole knowledge of the <U+FB01>gure
of the southern hemisphere rests on the arc of the meridian measured by
La Caille, and now remeasured and extended;by Maclear. The original
measurement, notwithstanding           the well-known ability of the great astro
nomer under whose superintendence it was executed, has not commanded
con<U+FB01>dence.         The degree inferred from it is far too great, and, if accepted,
would lead to the conclusion that the dimensions of the two hemispheres
are dissimilar.         But La Caille’s triangles were observed with a quadrant,
not   with   a  circle,  and were therefore liable to errors of eccentricity and of
<U+FB01>gure ; while the effects of local attraction, if recognized at all, were very
imperfectly appreciated.           These considerations induced Maclear, shortly
after his appointment to the Cape Observatory, to plan the veri<U+FB01>cation
which he has now accomplished.                Pursuing the still earlier inquiries of
Sir George Everest, he succeeded, though with considerable dif<U+FB01>culty, in
recovering      La Caille’s terminal stations; and, aided by the advice and en
couragement of Sir John Herschel (then at the Cape) and of the Astro
nomer Royal, he commenced the work of a remeasurement in 1836.                    The
proceedings were necessarily tedious ; the measurements of the base, of the
triangles, and of the zenith distances were repeated to an extent and with
precautions unpractiscd at the earlier period.           The zenith distances were
observed with the sector with which Bradley discovered             the aberration of
light and the nutation        of the earth’s axis, entrusted to Maclear by the    Ad

 172                          Anniversary Meeting.                       [Nov. 30,
 miralty;   and though made more <U+FB01>t for use in the <U+FB01>eld by improvements
 suggested by the Astronomer Royal, the transport of an instrument at once
 ponderous and delicate, through a wild and rugged country, was an under
 taking of no ordinary dif<U+FB01>culty ; but it was performed without injury.
 The terrestrial angles were taken with a 20-inch circle by Jones, and a
 smaller theodolite by Reichenbach,        both of remarkable precision.        The
 base, from which all the distances were derived, was measured with the
 compensation bars used in the Irish Triangulation.           Thus, in respect to
 the means employed, this are of the meridian may be regarded as inferior
 to none on record.     A full account of the whole was completed in 1806,
 and has been published by the Admiralty in two quarto volumes.             It does
 not con<U+FB01>rm the abnormal value obtained by La Caille, but shows a probable
 cause for the discordance.      La Caille‘s northern station was in a hollow
 surrounded by mountains, one of which, half a mile distant to the north,
 was a mass    of rock 2000 feet high, and others, at distances somewhat
 greater, were still near enough to create disturbance.       A station so situated
 was obviously ill suited to be a terminal station ; and the triangulation was
 extended across an immense plain of sand (the Bushman’s Flat) to a point
 without any visible source of local attraction.      By this extension, and by a
 similar one to the south, Maclcar’s arc has an amplitude nearly four times
 as great as that of La Caille, and is on this account, as well as on account
 of the greater accuracy in detail, far more deserving of con<U+FB01>dence.           The
 degree  which  is derived from  it is 1 133  feet shorter than that  of La Caille;
 and as   La Caille’s is 1051  feet longer than that given by the spheroid,
which, according to Airy, represents the average of northern arcs, it is evi
 dently a near approximation to the truth. This is even more distinctly shown
by the close agreement of the latitudes computed from the geodetic mea
 surements with those given by the sector—that of the north extremity
being 0"'4 in defect, that of the south extremity 0"'5 in excess.
    The Philosophical Transactions     of the past year contain an important
memoir by Mr. Abel,      F.R.S.,  to which has been assigned the distinction of
forming the Bakerian       Lecture for the year.       It is a most careful and
exhaustive treatise upon the circumstances which in<U+FB02>uence the stability of
gun-cotton.    He has made numerous experiments, both in the laboratory on
small quantities, and in store upon large quantities, of the material ; and
some of his experiments have been carried on upon the same sample for
three or four years.      The results arrived at in these investigations show
that gun-cotton, puri<U+FB01>ed accordingth Von Lenk’s directions, may be kept
either in the open air or in closed vessels, and may be exposed to diffused
daylight for very long periods, without undergoing any change.            The pre
servation of the material for between three and four years has been perfect.
By   prolonged exposure to sunlight, ordinary gun-cotton suffers a gradual
decomposition, which is somewhat more rapid when the cotton is damp
than when it is dry; but, even under these circumstances, the change pro
duced by several months of exposure is of a very tri<U+FB02>ing nature, and may

be counteracted      by very simple means, which in no way interfere with the
essential   qualities of the material.      All ordinary products contain small
quantities of organic (azctized) impurities, which are comparatively unstable.
It is the presence of these impurities in ordinary gun-cotton which gives
rise to the development of free acid when the substance is exposed to a high
temperature ; and the acid thus generated may eventually exert a destruc
tive action upon the pure portion of the mass (or true gun-cotton), and thus
establish a decomposition      which is materially accelerated by heat.      Mr. Abel
has, however, arrived      at the important practical     conclusion    that this mis
chief can    be averted   by neutralizing the acid as   it is liberated  ;  and this is
readily    effected by distributing through the <U+FB01>nished gun-cotton a small
quantity, say one per ccnt., of carbonate of soda.         By adopting this precau
tion, damp gun-cotton may be stored, closely packed, in large quantities,
and may be exposed to a heat equal to 212° Fahrenheit in con<U+FB01>ned spaces
for long periods, without undergoing any alteration.           The introduction into
the <U+FB01>nished gun-cotton of one per cent. of carbonate of soda affords, there
fore, security to the material against any destructive effects of the highest
temperature      to which it is likely to be exposed, even under very exceptional
climatic conditions.
    Actual immersion in water is not necessary for the most perfect preser
vation of gun-cotton.        The material, if only damp to the touch, does not
sustain the smallest change even if closely packed in large quantities.              If
as much water as possible be expelled from wet gun-cotton by the centri
fugal extractor, the cotton is obtained in a condition which, though only
 damp to the touch, is perfectly non-explosive.         It is therefore in this con
dition that all reserve stores of the substance should be preserved, and that
it should be transported to distant places. The proper preportion of the
carbonate of soda may be conveniently introduced by being dissolved in the
water by which the gun-cotton is wetted.
    it is in this immunity from danger in storage and in transport that pro
perly prepared gun-cotton possesses so great an advantage over gunpowder.
    Mr. Abel has also elaborately investigated the e<U+FB01>'ects of various kinds of
 defective preparation of gun-cotton, combined with systematically varied
 circumstances of exposure to heat, moisture, and light of the products so
obtained.      It is seen by these investigations that modi<U+FB01>cations in the pro
cesses of conversion and puri<U+FB01>cation, which appear at <U+FB01>rst sight of a very
tri<U+FB02>ing nature, exert most important in<U+FB02>uences on the composition and
 purity, and consequently on the stability, of the product.            It is shown by
Mr. Abel that to such causes are to be attributed the conclusions con
demnatory of gun-cotton which had been drawn by foreign chemistsnf con
siderable note.
    The distrust, not unreasonably entertained at the time, of the stability of
the material, was a principal cause of the desire on the part of Her Majesty’s
Government to refer the subject of gun-cotton to a Committee which should
include ome scienti<U+FB01>c members taken from the Royal Society.                 This great
and primary question being now satisfactorily      solved, the remaining secondary

  questions regarding the best forms or modes of adaptation of this material
  to some of the varied exigencies of the naval and military services, in which
 its employment might be preferable to that of gunpowder, may be regarded
 as more     properly belonging    to the executive   professional of<U+FB01>cers of Her
 Majesty’s Navy and Army.
     I have the great satisfaction of stating, on the part of the Committee,
 that no injury to life or limb has taken place in the course of their experi
 ments.
    At   the Nottingham Meeting of the British Association, the sum of £100
 was granted      to a Committee     for the purpose of exploring the Tertiary
 Plant-beds of North Greenland. The collections of fossil vegetable remains
 from the arctic regions which had been brought to this country and pre
 sented to various museums by Sir Leopold M'Clintock, Capt. Ingle<U+FB01>cld, and
 others, have all been sent to Prof. Oswald Heer, of Zurich, so well known
 for his researches into the Tertiary Fossil Flora of Europe. The similar
 collections which were preserved in the museums of Denmark and Sweden
had also been submitted      to the same authority   ;  and the results of his in
vestigation seem to show that North Greenland enjoyed, during part of the
Tertiary epoch, a climate very much milder than that which is now expe
                                                                            '
rienced in those latitudes.
    The description of the fossils is in process of publication by Prof. Hecr;
and in order to procure additional information on this very interesting sub
ject, the grant was made by the Association.
    The Greenland Committee, <U+FB01>nding that Mr. Edward Wbymper, one of
their members, was proceeding to Greenland in the summer of 1867,
handed the entire sum over to him; and <U+FB01>nding that additional funds
would      be  requisite, they made application to the Royal Society, who
gave £200 from         the Government Grant Fund, placed at the disposal of
                ~
the Society.
    Mr. Whymper has now returned from Greenland with a large and valu
able collection of specimens.       These will at once be subjected to examina
tion ; and when this work has been effected, a complete series of specimens
will  be deposited in the   British Museum, according to the conditions of the
grant, as made by the British Association and by the President and Council
of the Royal Society.
    I proceed to the award of the Medals.
    The Copley Medal has been awarded to           Karl Ernst von Baer of St.
Petersburg,      For. Memb. of the Royal Society, for his discoveries in Em
bryology and Comparative Anatomy, and for his contributions                to the
Philosophy of Zoology.
    Forty-one years ago it was believed by all the great authorities in ana
tomy and physiology that the embryos of man and ofother Jlfammalia origi
nated in quite a different manner from those of oviparous animals.           As to
the latter, everyday observation of fowls, snakes, frogs, and <U+FB01>shes had been

suf<U+FB01>cient to demonstrate, even without special scienti<U+FB01>c investigation, that
their young arose within eggs, and that these eggs were preformed within the
body of the virgin female. Further, the researches of Fabricius, of Harvey, of
Haller, of Caspar Friedrich Wolff, of Cruikshank, of Dollinger, of Pander,
of Prevost and Dumas, and of Dutrochet and Cuvier had traced back the em
bryos of the Ovipara to a very early stage, and had thrown much light upon
the changes undergone by those of the Mammalia. But the earliest condition
of the mammalian embryo was unknown.          Haller’s authority was still pre
dominant ; and Haller’s researches had enabled him to discover in the mam
malian uterus, shortly after impregnation,  nothing more than a semi<U+FB02>uid
substance, in  which, it was imagined, the embryo appeared by a kind of
crystallization. The origin of this semi<U+FB02>uid embryonic matter was sought
for in a mixture of the seminal <U+FB02>uid of the male with the contents of the
remarkable vesicles long before discovered by De Giaaf in the ovary of the
female, and called after him the Graa<U+FB01>an follicles.
   But in 1827 all such speculations were at once abolished, and the identity
in mode of origin between the embryos of the Mammalia and those of other
animals was demonstrated by a young Professor in the University of Konigs
berg, whose unwearied patience, sagacity, and sharpsightedness had enabled
him to trace back the foetus, step by step, to the minute egg, not a hun
dredth of an inch in diameter, to demonstrate that the Graatian follicle is
simply the chamber in which that egg is contained, and to prove that the
<U+FB01>rst step in mammalian generation, as in that of other animals, is the de
tachment of the egg from the organ of the parent in which it is developed.
   This capital discovery forms one of the grounds upon which the Copley
Medal is to-day awarded to the sometime Professor in Ko'nigsberg, but now,
and for many years past, the honoured Academician of St. Petersburg, Karl
 Ernst von Baer.
     Von Baer’s great discovery was not the result of accident, but was the
 reward of long-continued and most laborious investigations into the deve
 lopment, not only of the chick and of the mammalian embryo, but of other
 animals.      The <U+FB01>rst part of a great work entitled “ Ueber Entwickclungs
 geschichte der Thiere. Bcobachtungen und Re<U+FB02>exioncn,” embodying some
 of the results of these inquiries, and mainly of the investigations into the
  development of the chick, appeared in 1828; the second part, in which
  the mammalia are chie<U+FB02>y treated of, was published in 1837.
     It is impossible to overestimate the value of this remarkable book, or to
 doubt the great in<U+FB02>uence which it has exerted, and still exerts, upon the
  growth of a sound philosophy of Biology.
     At the time of its appearance there was nothing that could be compared
  with    it,
            as   special monograph upon the formation of the chick, or as
                   a                                                                      a

  Vcrtebrata in general, or as an exposition of the signi<U+FB01>cance of development
  and of the bearing of the study of embryology upon classi<U+FB01>cation.       And,
 as   a   whole,   it   may be safely said that   it   remains at the present day, though

      It is to Von Baer that we owe the great generalization that all develop
  ment is a progress from the general to the special—a law which has its ap
  plication in wide regions not contemplated by its author.        It is to him that
  we are indebted     for the  truth  that zoological a<U+FB01>inity is the  expression of
  similarity of deve10pment, and that the di<U+FB01>‘ercnt great types of animal
   structure are the result of different modes of development.

  ciently justi<U+FB01>ed the award of the Copley Medal to Von Baer had he not
  been the discoverer of the mammalian ovum.
      Besides these labours of primary importance, the energy, versatility, and
  wide learning of Von Baer have been shown in multitndinous other direc
  tions—in numerous memoirs on Comparative Anatomy, Systematic Zoology,
 and Zoological Distribution, in most valuable and original essays on An
 thropology and Ethnology, and in scienti<U+FB01>c expeditions to different parts of
 the widespread Russian Empire, from Nowaja Zemlja to the Caspian.
     Von Baer was born in Esthonia in the year 17 92. His father was a gentle
 man of landed property and “ Ritterschafts-Hauptman
                                                            ” of Esthonia. Two
 years ago, on the occasion of the <U+FB01>ftieth anniversary of the venerable Academi
 cian’s Doctorate, the nobility of Esthonia, headed by their present Ritter
 schafts-Hauptman,      the Baron von der Pahlen, formed themselves into an as
 sociation for the purpose of celebrating the occasion ; and as a memento of
 proceedings honourable alike to their eminent countryman and to themselves,
 published the autobiography which he wrote at their request with all the ac
 cessories of typographic     luxury. Thirty-six years ago the Academic des
 Sciences of Paris, at the instance of Humboldt, and on the report of Cnvier,
 awarded Von Baer a medal.         In  1854 he was chosen a Foreign Member of
the Royal Society.
     We may rejoice that it is not yet too late to offer the highest honour at
the disposal of the Royal Society of London to a man who has so long been
recognized on the continent as one of the great lights of biological science,
who will take his place hereafter beside Cuvier, Wolff, and Harvey.

    I  will request you, on the part of the Society, to transmit this Medal to
our venerated colleague, Dr. von Beer, and to express to him our hope that

and Joseph Henry Gilbert for their researches in Agricultural Chemistry.
    Messrs. Lawes    4" Gilbert have    been engaged for the last twenty-four

years in a systematic series of researches upon Agricultural Chemistry, with
a view of determining,  by exact experiments, the principles, chemical and
physiological, which are involved in the general and fundamental processes
of successful agriculture.
     These investigations     have embraced    :
     l.   Researches     into the exhaustion       of soils, including experiments on
wheat, on barley, on turnips, on clover, and legnminous            crops.
     2. Researches on the principles of rotation and fallow.
     3. On the mixed herbage of grass-land.
   4. On the process of vegetation generally, including researches upon the
action of manures.
   5. On the origin of nitrogen in plants (Phil. Trans. 1861).
   6. Researches on the feeding and fattening of animals (Phil. Trans.
1859).
   It is dif<U+FB01>cult to give in a short compass the practical conclusions arrived
at from a series of investigations upon a number of subjects each so com
plicated in its nature, so important in its object, and continued systemati
cally over so protracted a period. At the time your medallists commenced
their experiments it was generally supposed that certain saline bodies, or
so-called mineral constituents, were essential to the growth and develop
ment of the plant, and that such substances must be furnished to it by the
soil.   The necessity of a certain quantity of nitrogen was also recognized;
but it was imagined, since wild plants could thrive without any arti<U+FB01>cial
supply of nitrogen, that a suf<U+FB01>cient amount of this element existed in the
atmosphere (in the form chie<U+FB02>y of salts of ammonia) to render it unnecessary
to take any steps for increasing this supply ; and it was supposed that the
fertility of   a soil   might be maintained for an inde<U+FB01>nite period if the different
mineral constituents       carried off by the crop were annually returned in due
quantity      as mineral   manure to the soil.
     This mineral-ash      theory, as   it
                                       was termed, was proposed by Liebig; but
ithas been proved          by Messrs. Lawes & Gilbert to be erroneous, as it em
braces a part only of the truth.
   The <U+FB01>eld experiments upon which this conclusion rests were commenced
in 1843. Fourteen acres, divided into about twenty plots, were devoted to
experiments upon wheat, and seven acres, divided into about twenty-four
plots, to experiments upon turnips. Subsequently similar experiments were
made upon beans, clover, barley, and the mixed herbage of permanent
                                                                                        '
meadow-land.     The general plan of the <U+FB01>eld experiments consisted in se-
lecting <U+FB01>elds in a condition of agricultural exhaustion, that          is,
                                                              in state in    a
which fresh supply of manure was needed to <U+FB01>t the soil for the growth of
          a
another crop.     Upon this exhausted soil each of the most important crops
in the rotation were grown, year after year, upon the same spot, both with
out manure and with many different descriptions of manure, each of which
was, as    rule, applied year after year to the same plot.
           a                                               By this means           it
was possible to determine the point of relative exhaustion 01' excessive sup
ply of any of the constituents of the manure.

      Wheat, for example, was grown year after year upon the same land for
  twenty-four years; turnips (with an interval of three years) for twenty
  <U+FB01>ve years; and in the experiments on rotation (which comprised the “ four
  course” of turnips, barley, leguminous crop [or fallow], and wheat) the
  last of the <U+FB01>fth “ four course
                                   ”
                                      rotation was completed, comprising twenty
  years in   all.
      Parallel with the <U+FB01>eld experiments, records relating to the fall of
  rain, atmospheric pressure, temperature of the air, and of the dew-point
  were kept       or collated, so as   to enable the observers to ascertain       the
  effects  of  the varying season    upon   the quantity  and quality of the <U+FB01>eld
  produce.
      It soon became evident that much remained to be done in perfecting
  the methods of chemical analysis before comparative analyses could afford
  much assistance in determining         the relative productiveness of different
  soils; and to this object our medallists addressed themselves both with
  skill and success.
      The practical value of these experiments may be seen from the fact
 that, taking the results of twenty years, the annual average produce in
 bushels of wheat per acre without manure was 16 i, with farmyard
 manure exactly double, and with arti<U+FB01>cial mauures 35                 bushels, the
 latter being considerably more than the average produce of Great Britain
 when wheat is grown in the ordinary course.
      The produce of wheat grown successively on the same plot without
 manure scarcely altered from year to year, whilst that of the turnips be—
 came reduced to nothing ; the effect of a manure of superphosphate being
 most marked upon the turnips,
                                      whilst the employment of salts of ammonia
 mixed with alkaline salts and phosphates was most suitable for wheat,
 although these are not the manures indicated by a simple analysis of the
 ashes of the two crops.        The authors remark, “Indeed the whole ten
 dency of agricultural investigation seems to show the fallacy of alone
relying upon the knowledge of the composition of a crop, as directing to
the constituents probably more especially required to be provided for it by
manures;       and rather that the elucidation    of agricultural principles must
be looked      for from a due consideration of Vegetable Physiology, as well
as Chemistry, of the special functional peculiarities and resources of dif
ferent plants, as well as their actual percentage composition.”
     The investigation into the feeding of animals was even more laborious ;
 but it was a necessary complement to the experiments upon the growth of
 crops.     It was directed to the solution of the following among other im
portant problems      :—
     1.  The amount of food consumed, and its several constituents, in rela
tion to the production of a given live weight, for different animals.
     2. The comparative development of the different organs in the fattening
of animals, and their composition.
     3. The relation of the manure produced, both in quantity and quality,
                                                                                I
to the food consumed.

principal results of which are given in        a paper published  in the Philoso_

inquiries to which a brief reference has been made, have been conducted
with a skill, perseverance, and success which have placed their authors, by
general consent, at the head of those who have pursued              this important
branch of experimental inquiry.

     Receive this Medal in testimony of the Royal Society’s recognition of
your joint labours, and of their approval of the object to which those
labours have been directed,—which, while not outstepping the wide limits
of    a Society devoted to the promotion of natural knowledge, is yet in an
unusual degree connected with the supply of man’s primary wants.                  It

high appreciation of the long devotion, the patient unbiassed desire for
truth, and the sound scienti<U+FB01>c manner of proceeding which have charac
terized your investigations.
     The Council have awarded      a Royal Medal to Sir \Villiam Logan for his
geological researches in Canada, and the construction          of a geological map
of that colony.
     Sir \Villiarn Logan was early known to English geologists for very meri
torious work in the Coal-<U+FB01>elds of South Wales, which was highly approved
at the time by the authorities of the English Geological Survey, and is un
 derstood to have furnished the model for similar surveys in other British
 Coal-<U+FB01>elds.
     In   1843 he undertook   the direction of the Geological Survey of his na
 tive country,    Canada, instituted by the Provincial Government.          The re
 sults of this survey have been published in Annual Reports; and a large and
 important volume was published in 1863, condensing the whole of the
 geological and palaeontological information which had been amassed by Sir
 \Villiam and the assistants who acted under his direction.
      Under di<U+FB01>iculties of which British geologists acquainted with both coun
  tries afiirm that little idea can be formed here, he has made clear the rela
 tions of all the formations of Canada to each other.             These consist of
 Lower and Upper Laurentian rocks, Huronian, numerous divisions of the
 Lower and Upper Silurian strata, and the Devonian series. Most of these
 he correlated as far as possible with the European series and with the sub
 divisions described by the American geologists of the United States.
      One of the most important services that Sir \V. Logan has rendered to
  geological science was the discovery of the relations of the Laurentian rocks
  to each other and to the later formations.          These Laurentian   rocks had

    been previously only called granite and gneiss, and vaguely confounded with
    granitic and gneissic rocks of Silurian age.      Sir William <U+FB01>rst proved their
    great antiquity by showing that they consist of strata which had been in
   tensely disturbed and metamorphosed before the deposition of the oldest
   Silurian beds.     Next, he showed that the Laurentian rocks consist of two
   series of metamorphic strata, and that the Upper Laurentian strata or gneiss
   lies quite unconformahly on the Lower Laurentian masses.             Thirdly, he
   made the important discovery of the Eozoon Canadense in the Limestone
   beds of the Lower Laurentian series.
      The great importance of this discovery becomes manifest when we con
   Sider the evidence of the enormous antiquity of the strata thus proved to be
  fossiliferous,    compared with the Lingula-<U+FB01>ags and Cambrian sarata, in
  which the oldest previously known fossils had been found.         It has seriously
  modi<U+FB01>ed the speculative opinions of many geologists and zoologists.

  of the appreciation by the Royal Society of his arduous labours in the
  accomplishment of the great work of the Geological Survey of Canada,

  blished by his investigations.

 by   Mr. Caesar Hawkins, it was resolved,—“ That the thanks of the Society

   By examination of the thyroid body in the foetus, we learn that it has
from an early period, much the same relations and appearances as belong
to it in childhood, and during the adult condition, and we observe those
diversities of its parts which are exceptionally recognized during the later
periods of life. We may thus trace out the origin of such exceptional
conditions, and notice, more especially, how the isthmus of Eustachius
and the pyramid of Lalouette are connected with the formation of the
thyroid, and depend for their after characters upon early changes during
development of size.
   As   I  have reason to believe that the formation of the thyroid in man
may   be  fairly reexamined, I shall venture to refer, in the <U+FB01>rst place, to
some of the opinions advanced with regard to its earliest appearances.
   The late Mr. GrayT has alluded to the views of Huschke, Arnold, Bis
cho<U+FB02>', and Goodsir, respecting the development of this body. It is enough
for my present purpose to state that Arnold considered the thyroid to be
developed from the membranous air-tube, where the larynx is formed,
whilst Goodsiri thought that it originated in that portion of the mem
brana intermedia of Reichert which remains in connexion with the arms
tomosing vessels between the <U+FB01>rst and second aortic arches, or carotid and

subclavian arteries.             At   <U+FB01>rst, he states, no isthmus is observed (in sheep),
but  presently         lateral   masses     join across and in front of the base of the
heart and root of the neck.   Then the thyroid separates from the thymus,
from which it differs in not being divided into lobules.   Simon‘ has no
reason for believing that its origin has any particular relation to that of
the thymus.     Undoubtedly, he adds, there is a period when it is im
possible to say how much of the unshaped blastema of the neck belongs
to one organ, how much to another, but so soon as the microscope can
discover the <U+FB01>rst traces of their development, it likewise affords unques
tionable evidence of their distinctness, and shows each as separate in itself,
and as peculiar in structure, as at any later period of growth.
   Hand<U+FB01>eld Jones'f found in a ftetal sheep two inches long that the thy
roid presented the usual appearance; it possessed an isthmus, and in a
human ftetus of four months and a half, the isthmus appeared of the same
standing as the lateral masses.
  The    absence        of an isthmus in an entire class, that of birds, the observa
tions of Gray on the formation of this body in the chick, and the sugges
tions of Meckel, Cruveilbier and others, countenance the supposition that
the thyroid is developed from two lateral masses.
  There are no reliable observations respecting the development of the
pyramid, but Haller and Arnold have hazarded the opinion that it is pro
bably the duct of the thyroid during fmtal life.
   In describing the following dissections,               I
                                            may state that the specimens
were examined as they came into my possession without selection, save for
age, so that they may be assumed to represent very fairly the conditions
commonly existing during foetal life.
   In a human foetus, measuring in length eight-tenths of an inch (be
tween the seventh and eighth week), the thyroid is a body of a pale yel
lowish colour, lying across the front of the trachea, just below the mass
out of which the     cartilages of the larynx are being developed.      It is
closely connected with the trachea and with the lower edge of the larynx,
either of which would be torn in endeavouring to remove          but the thy it,
roid     easily
        is      uncovered    by stripping off the parts super<U+FB01>cial to     and         it,
has no connexion with these or with the thymus (<U+FB01>g.                          1):.   Although
consisting at this period of but one piece, the thyroid                 isdeeply notched,
and thus looks as though made up of three distinct                  lobes, one sometimes
bi<U+FB01>d, in the centre, and this  the smallest, and another on either side
                                            is
elongated and inclined upwards by the side of the larynx.    Similar divi
sions are seen in  foetus measuring two inches and eight-tenths in length

    That the connexions of the thyroid are from the <U+FB01>rst with the larynx
and trachea, rather      than with the thymus, is rendered more probable by
the appearances      observed     in the young of animals.         In a foetal rabbit
(<U+FB01>g. 3)*, eight-tenths of an inch long, the thymus may be seen to con
sist of two lobulated masses,           lying side by side just above the heart
and its great vessels, broader at the base towards the thorax, diverging a
little as they pass upwards, and ending in the root of the neck by a
somewhat pointed extremity.              The trachea in the middle line is sur
mounted by the larynx, but at its upper extremity is a minute elevation,
contrasting by its pale colour with adjacent parts; and connected with this
are two divergent ridges, of the same pale colour, which embrace, horse
shoe fashion, the lower portion of the larynx, tapering as they ascend,
and resembling, so far as the mere look is concerned, the division of
the trachea at its lower extremity into the two bronchi.               In a fmtal pig
(<U+FB01>g.   4)T,   one  inch     and    two-tenths   in  length, the   thyroid is notched
below,   thus   acquiring, though somewhat indistinctly, a three-lobed ap
pearance;    and here also, whilst <U+FB01>rmly attached to the trachea, it is no way
visibly in relation with the thymus.                                              7
    One cannot but be attracted by this connexion with the trachea, on
which tube the thyroid (even if it be not developed from the membranous
 air-tube) buds and attains some little size, a formation reminding one of that
of the lungs coming out from the front wall of the (esophagus, that is, from
the trachea, and of the view of Mr. Simon, as afterwards expressed by the
editors of Cuvierjj respecting the thyroid, “C’est la fausse branchie, bran
chiole des poissons."        Indeed, from its relation to the air-tube during the
early period of life, or in <U+FB01>sh to the vertebral or hyoidal extremity of the
gill, from its curious alternation with the supplementary gill of Broussonet§,
 and from its structure (Kolliker), it may be not inaptly referred to as a
pseudo-lung rather than as an associate with the thymus and the so-called
 ductless glands.
    I may add that, in the human foetus, no distinct evidence of the thyroid
appears to me to exist before the sixth week, up to which time it cannot,           I
believe, be isolated from the structures         in the front of the neck ; it seems
to come out from the blastema in the form of a mass in front of the
trachea, which quickly acquires an imperfectly lobed condition, but I have
not been able to distinguish at any period, during development of size,
three completely      distinct parts.

                                     The Isthmus.
   In  the dissections already referred to, the presence of a middle portion,
and its equal development with the lateral lobes, leads to the inference
that this central part is present from the earliest period, and that the thy
roid isthmus is not formed by a growing together of two distinct side
pieees.    Yet in the human foetus, at four months, Fleischmaun and Meckel
say that they found, as they described them, two lateral lobes only; and
the hare, for example, has been written of as having but two distinct lateral
masses,   as also were the Cetacea     until Professor Turner" explained that the
thyroid of    a well-grown     male porpoise was a single mass extending across
the trachea, of which       the median portion could hardly be described as an
intervening    isthmus; for in its supero-inferior diameter it equalled that of
the lateral    portion. In addition, however, to the dissections already de
tailed, I have examined the thyroid in foetal hares, and have always found
the middle portion equally developed with the side lobes, and bounded by
notches, which seem to de<U+FB01>ne it from them (<U+FB01>g. 5).                 With the growth
of this fwtus, as also in the young of cats and of dogs, I have observed
that the central part appears to <U+FB02>atten and to lose the rounded lobular
condition, and sometimes it disappears altogether.
                                       The Lobes.
    Whilst, however, three lobes        are chie<U+FB02>y indicated,    lesser notches may
be   occasionally    seen, and continue     to be noticeable    as the foetus   grows,
though they       are  very irregular  and   uncertain.   Thus    in  a human   ftetus,
three inches and nine-tenths long, the left lobe (<U+FB01>g. 6)1- is divided
into two portions by a deep <U+FB01>ssure, one-half of it ascending to the left of
the middle      line in front of the cricoid and thyroid cartilages, and there
are other notches faintly outlining a middle lobe.           In a foetus four inches
and three-tenths long, the middle lobe is bi<U+FB01>d, a           cleft   dividing it above;
and in another fmtus, four inches and six-tenths long, the entire thyroid
is very irregularly formed, broken into several lobes, but still showing at
its lower margin a division into three chief portions (<U+FB01>gs. 7 & 8)I.
 Here also a process ascends, budding out from the left side, tapers almost
 to a point, and ends by being <U+FB01>xed to the under surface of the os
 hyoides.
    Omitting lesser varieties,      I  will describe the following.       The thyroid
from    a  fuatus    eight  inches   and   seven-tenths  long (<U+FB01>g. 10)§, consists
of two chief lobes, which         meet,   but are not   united,   in the middle line,
being separated by a deep <U+FB01>ssure.             From the left lobe, just anterior to
 the lower angle of the thyroid cartilage, a small process projects upwards,

 and resembles the base of the process in either <U+FB01>gure 6 or 7, wanting the
 stalk-like continuation towards the os hyoides.       The right lobe is some
 what irregular along its upper border; but just where it reaches the
 middle line there is a lozenge-shaped piece of gland, more closely con
 nected with the right than with the left lobe, from which latter it is sepa
 rated by a distinct <U+FB01>ssure, afaintly marked line extending above for a short
 distance between it and the right lobe. This lozenge-shaped portion ascends,
 and is adherent to the lower notch in the middle line of the thyroid carti
 lage ; its extremities are pointed, and the lower one just falls short of the
 level of the inferior margin of the lateral masses.     In another fcetus (<U+FB01>g.
  ll)*, the led lobe, three-tenths and a half of an inch in length, is irregu
 larly and slightly notched. The right lobe, traced towards the middle line,
 shows scarce a sign of a middle portion; but there is a small distinct mass
 adhering closely to           it,
                           and this narrowing rapidly, becomes over the thy
 roid   aslender band, and can be traced Upwards until        ends by adheringit
 to the posterior inferior surface of the hyoid bone.
    The evidence obtained from these dissections goes to show that the thy
roid     connected, in man, from
        is                           very early period with the upper portion

of distinct lateral masses, and the appearances       presents at that date are
                                                                  it

It      marked out, more or less distinctly, into three principal parts or
       is
lobes, but these are united at the seventh week of ftetal life and form,
save exceptionally,    one thyroid body.
   The isthmus appears to consist of the smaller middle division uniting
the other two, but there may be an absence of isthmus through failure of
this union-1', the middle portion joining the right or left lobe, and thus
making one lateral portion larger than the other,           condition sometimes

        Life, and Season.” By ROBERT IVARINGTQN, F.R.S., F.C.S.
        Received October 19, 1867.
    In carrying out through a series of years the principles of the aquarium
for sustaining animal life in a con<U+FB01>ned and limited portion of water through
the medium of growing vegetation *, I had observed that, during the sum
mer months of the year, a considerable deposit made its appearance on the
leaves of the plants and the glass front of the containing vessel, which was
found to consist of carbonate of lime in a crystalline condition.              This de
posit formed a nidus for the growth of confervoid vegetation, which, at cer
tain seasons of the year, increased very rapidly. These observations were
alluded to at one of the Friday-evening meetings of the Royal Institution,
March 27, 1857, when portions of the deposit were exhibited, and its com
position demonstrated by experiment.
    The formation of this deposit was then explained as arising from the fact
that, as the summer season advances, and we have a longer continuance and
also a greater intensity of the light of the sun, the absorption and conse
quent decomposition of carbonic acid by the plants is carried to a much
greater extent, while the quantity of carbonic acid produced by the <U+FB01>sh re—
mains unchanged.         The solvent of the carbonate of lime contained in the
water being thus withdrawn, a deposit slowly takes place, incrusting the
sides of the tank, particularly towards the light, where the confervoid
growth,    consequent upon it, accumulates in large quantities.
    In  continuing these observations, my attention was particularly arrested
by the steady increase of deposition, attendant upon the renewed activity of
the leaves, during the spring; and this determined me to ascertain by expe—
riment the quantity of carbonate of lime existent in the water at <U+FB01>xed

intervals during along        period of time.      And inasmuch as the degrees of
hardness, indicated by the measures of Clark’s soap-test, presented a very
ready, accurate, and simple means of arriving at this result, that mode of
estimation was adopted, care being taken to displace any uncombined car
bonic acid by agitating the sample with atmospheric air prior to the addition
of the test, as directed by Dr. Clark, the indications or degrees thus ob

 for about two inches, with a mixture of sandy loam and gravel, into which
 several plants of the Vallimeria spiralis, the vegetable member of the ar
 rangement, were inserted.             Some large fragments of rough rockwork,
 principally limestone, were also placed upright on the bottom to break up
  the stiff outline of the square framing, and give a pleasing e<U+FB01>'ect to the eye.
  The animal branch of the circle consisted of four small crucian carp with a
  gold carp.        Several freshwater mollusks, principally Planorbis corneas
  and Limneus palustris, were also introduced to act as scavengers and con
  sume the decaying vegetation.           The tank was loosely covered with a plate
  of glass, so as to allow    of a free admission     of the external air, and at the
  same time keep out a great deal         of the soot and dust of the London atmo
  sphere and impede the too rapid evaporation of the water. As the Tricho
  manes were stated to delight in shade, a thin muslin blind was placed over
  the covering glass.
      The aquarium was located in a window-way having an eastern aspect, but,
  being surrounded within a few yards by the high walls of adjoining houses,
  the direct rays of the sun only reached it for about three hours in the
  morning during the months of June and July.                  It was established in
  January 1851, and has not since been disturbed, except by occasional sup
   plies of distilled or rain-water, to replace the loss in volume arising from
   evaporation.      It had been my custom to weed out the excessive growth of
  the Vallisneria during the summer, and also to remove some of the <U+FB02>akv de
   posit of calcareous matter from the surface of the glass nearest the light;
  but as I considered that such disturbances might interfere with the course
 of the investigation, these operations were discontinued.

    The amount of calcareous matter dissolved will be seen to have steadily
decreased during the spring and summer months, from its maximum in
March 1861 and February 1862 to its minimum in July 1861 and August
 1862, and then to have increased as steadily during the autumn and winter
months.
    Part of this hardness, however, unquestionably arose from the presence
in the water of other salts of lime besides the carbonate.                      To determine
how much was the next point for investigation.                     Portions of the water
were taken on several occasions and boiled for a considerable time, <U+FB01>ltered,
and the volume restored to its original bulk with distilled water.                       On ex
amining these portions with the soap-test, it was 'found that the hardness
was lowered to 5'6 degrees, equivalent to 5'6 grains of carbonate of lime.
But inasmuch as carbonate of lime is soluble in water to the extent of
2'4 grains in the imperial gnllon', this will be reduced to 3'2 grains, which
amount will therefore have to be deducted from each of the above results,
in order to arrive at the true quantity of carbonate present in solution.
   The maximum and minimum results will then stand thus :—

192         Mr. Warington       on Alteration   of Carbonate-of-Lime       [Dec.5,
     The data thus obtained will help to elucidate several very important and
interesting phenomena in respect to all the three elements of the arrange
ment—the water, the <U+FB01>sh, and the vegetation.
                                     l.   The Water.
     The importance of growing submerged vegetation in maintaining waters,
 rich in carbonate of lime, in a meliorated state by diminishing their hard
 ness has been clearly demonstrated by the foregoing data; and how neces
 sary, therefore, it is that this association should be kept in view whenever
 a soft and healthful water is required for domestic purposes.       Unfortunately
 this appears hitherto not to have been well understood, or at all events has
 been little attendcd to, since the very agent which has been provided na
 turally for effecting these bene<U+FB01>cial results has been most commonly
 regarded as an evil, and studiously eradicated in all directions. These data
 will also explain the cause of the rapid growth of vegetation in well-waters
 rich in carbonic acid, when pumped into tanks or reservoirs and exposed to
 the full light of day.       The plant-germs, naturally contained in the water
 or absorbed from the atmosphere, being supplied with an abundance of ap
 propriate nourishment, rapidly vegetate, and the containing vessels, parti
 cularly during the summer months, soon become thickly coated with a
  dense confervoid growth.
      It will also follow that all <U+FB01>sh, as generators of carbonic acid, should be
  excluded from waters <U+FB02>owing over carbonate~of-lime strata, and intended
  for the supply of towns &c., as tending to increase their hardness.             Of
  course the absence of calcareous matter would prevent such an effect taking
  place—a fact borne out by the well-known softness of springs and rivers
  <U+FB02>owing out of or over granite or sandstone rocks, even when thickly inha
  bited by the scaly tribe.
                                        2. The Fish.
      It is well known that water has the property of absorbing air from the sur
  rounding    atmosphere, and holding it in solution to the extent of from one
  fortieth to one-thirtieth of its volume, not, however, without somewhat
  changing the proportion of its constituents;          for when the absorbed air is
  abstracted    from   water it usually   contains about thirty-two per cent. of oxy
  gen gas, instcsd of twenty-one.        This oxygen is converted by the respiration
   of the <U+FB01>sh into carbonic acid, which is held dissolved by a still stronger
   a<U+FB01>inity, the water being capable of retaining as much as its own volume
   of this gas in solution at the ordinary temperature and pressure of the
                              '   '
   atmosphere.
       In the above-described arrangement the carbonic acid thus produced is
   absorbed by the submerged vegetation under the in<U+FB02>uence of the sun's
   light; the carbon is appropriated for its growth, while the oxygen is again
  liberated and held in solution        by the water, provided the evolution is not
   too rapid, an effect produced by too great an exposure to the sun’s light.
    When this is the case, much of the oxygen necessarily escapes into the air

                                                                            do.
in a gaseous state and is lost.   During the winter season, however, when
the active functions of vegetation are to a great extent dormant, from the
diminishcd quantity and intensity of the sun’s light, the amount of car
bonic acid produced by the respiration of the <U+FB01>sh is greater than the plants
are capable of consuming, and the excess must necessarily accumulate in the
water.   Were the production of carbonic acid con<U+FB01>ned to a short period,
the water would doubtless right itself after a time, the poisonous gas
                                                                       passing
away and fresh atmospheric air being absorbed. As, however, the production
of carbonic acid is constant, this ameliorating action can have little effect;
the water must remain always highly charged with carbonic acid. Here, then,
its solvent action on the carbonate of lime, present in the rockwork and gra
vel, comes into play, and the hardness of the water is gradually increased in
proportion as the light diminishes. Now, supposing for an instant that nocar
bonate of lime had been present in the arrangement, the question arises, what
must then have ensued? The <U+FB01>sh would have continued to respire, and would
produce carbonic acid as before, which, remaining in a free state dissolved in
the water, would unquestionably have had a most detrimental effect upon
their health. Every one must have noticed the manner in which the golden
carp con<U+FB01>ned in a globe of water, in which there is no growing vegetation
to decompose the carbonic acid generated, or no limestone to combine with                         it,
rise to the surface and continually gulp in the air required for their vital
functions.   Nothing whatever of this kind has ever been noticed in the
aquarium under consideration, although the quantity of carbonic acid dis
solved in the water has been at times very large.
   From the experiments of Bischof‘, we glean that the carbonic acid con
tained in  saturated aqueous solution
              a                           entirely displaced by
                                                   is             current of      a
atmospheric air passed through     for <U+FB01>ve minutes
                                           it         and also  that, by the
                                                                   ;             T
same means,    solution of carbonate of lime, in water previously saturated
                    a
with carbonic acid, will have all the excess of gas displaced in <U+FB01>fteen mi
nutes, leaving the water with bicarbonate of lime in solution.          It in this         is
form of combination that MM. PcligotI and P0ggia1e§ consider the car
bonate of lime to exist in the water of the Seine, and M. Bineau             in that      1|
of the Rhone, in which rivers they state there          no free carbonic acid. In
                                                              is

amounting to 14-2 grains in the imperial gallon, which would require nearly
   grains of carbonic acid gas to dissolve it.

        Yet, although the quantity of poisonous gas had been thus increased, we
    <U+FB01>nd no deleterious action on the health of the <U+FB01>sh, no disturbance in the
    ordinary respiration, no gulping at the surface of the water for fresh air.
    It is quite evident, therefore, that the carbonic acid, by entering into com
    bination with carbonate of lime, however weak that combination may be,
    is thereby rendered perfectly innocuous, and a wonderful provision is
    thus a<U+FB01>‘orded for preventing this poisonous agent from becoming fatal to
    animal life.
        We turn now to the next member of our arrangement.
                                      3.  The Vegetation.
        It will be seen from the foregoing        numerical results that the maximum
     quantity of dissolved carbonate of lime, and consequently of carbonic acid,
    is foundjust before the period of the reviving energies of the plant’s growth,
    namely, the spring time of the year, when the days are lengthening and the
     sun’s light is continually increasing in strength; the minimum quantity
    when this growth has attained its greatest exuberance, namely, when the
     summer months are past and the light is beginning to decrease in its in
   tensity and the days to shorten.             So exactly, indeed, are the energies of
   'the plants regulated by the amount of light to which they            are exposed, that
     a constant arrangement,      such as that here described,       affords an excellent
     indication   of the variation of the seasons in dill’erent years, or might even
, -be made      a rough    measure of the total amount of light from month to
     month.
        But while the demand for carbonic acid on the part of the plant varies
     in this manner with the seasons, the amount of that gas produced by the
     respiration of the <U+FB01>sh is very nearly the same all through the year. “'hence,
     then, does the plant obtain that additional quantity of food which its
     stimulated    energies require during the spring and early summer months,
     and which its rapid and luxurious growth show to be readily supplied?
     After what has been stated,       I  think the source must be apparent to every
     one—it is from the carbonic acid which has been gradually accumulated,
     and rendered innocuous to animal life from its being held in combination
     with carbonate of lime, in so marvellous a manner during the winter

   The paper commences with an account of the concluding observations
taken by the author at Windsor, N.S., of which the previous portion has
already been published in the Proceedings,’ vols. xii. xiv.                    &

     It
    then goes on to describe the self-recording apparatus employed at
Kew Observatory for the observation of atmospheric electricity, and the
method of procedure employed in measuring and reducing the curves thus
obtained, this portion of the work having been performed in the Physical
Laboratory of the University of Glasgow.
   Tables are given showing the mean hourly values of- the electrical potential
for each month, and the mean monthly values are hence derived.           These
values for Kew are compared with the corresponding values for Windsor,
N.S., and remarkable di<U+FB02>'erenees are shown to exist between the curves,
both diurnal and annual, for the two places.
  The hourly means at Kew for the mean of the year are represented by
the following        numbers       :—

the year.

generic characters (principal, supplementary, or simultaneous) of the con

complete character must satisfy.

     We shall conclude this part of our subject with the two theorems :—
        Every genus, of which the character satis<U+FB01>es the condition of pos
      (i)
sibility, actually exists.
   (ii) Two forms, of the                        same         invariants,      of the      same        order, and of the
same genus are transformnble,                               each into the other,               by   rational       linear sub
stitutions of which the determinants are units, and in which                                                    the denomi
nators of the coef<U+FB01>cients are prime to any given number.
   The <U+FB01>rst of these theorems shows that the condition of possibility   suf—                                                 is
<U+FB01>cient as well as necessary; the second establishes the completeness of the
enumeration of ordinal and generic characters.

   “If, in addition, M is prime to I,,_2, there is always either one or two
genera of forms of the invariants (1,, 1,, . . . M 1,,_,) capable of primitive
representation by forms of a given genus of the invariants (1,, Is, . . . I,,_._.,

   These theorems are especially useful in the theory of de<U+FB01>nite forms, to
which, for the remainder of this paper, we shall con<U+FB01>ne our attention.   In
the case of such forms we understand by the weight of a form the reciprocal
of the number of its positive automorphies, by the weight of a class the
weight of any form representing the class ; the weight of a genus, or
order, is the sum of' the weights of the classes contained in the genus or
order; the weight of a representation of a number by a form is the weight
of the representing form ; the weight of a representation of a form by a
form is the product of the weights of the representing and represented
forms.

     Eisenstein    has observed that, when the number of indeterminates does
 not surpass eight, there is but one class of quadratic forms of the dis
 criminant l, but that, when the number of indeterminates surpasses eight,
 there is always more than one such class.                   This observation is in ac
 cordance with our general formulae, except             that they imply the existence of
 an improperly primitive class of eight indeterminates                  and of the dis
 criminant 1.
    The theorems which have been given by Jacobi, Eisenstein, and recently
 in great profusion by M. Liouvillc, relating to the representation of numbers
 by four squares and other simple quadratic forms, appear to be dcducible
 by a uniform method from the principles indicated in this paper.                      So
also are the theorems relating to the representation of numbers by six
and eight squares, which are implicitly contained in the developments
given by Jacobi in the ‘Fundamenta Nova.’                    As the series of theorems
relating to the representation of numbers by sums of squares ceases, for
the reason assigned by Eisenstein, when the number of squares surpasses
eight, it is of some importance to complete it.              The only cases which have
not been fully considered           are those of <U+FB01>ve and seven squares.        The prin
cipal    theorems     relating   to  the  case  of <U+FB01>ve  squares  have indeed  been  given
by Eisenstein (Crclle’s Journal, vol. xxxv. p. 368); but he has considered
only those numbers which are not divisible by any square. “’0 shall here
complete his enunciation of those theorems, and shall add the corresponding
theorems for the case of seven squares.                   We attend only to primitive
representations.

Whether, for forms of four and six indeterminates, similar formulae exist
comparable to the less elementary formulae of M. Kronecker, and whether,
for forms containing more than six indeterminates, such formulae exist at
all, are questions well worthy of the attention of arithmeticians.

I. “On        the Special Action of the Pancreas on Fat and Starch.”
        By     HORACE DOBELL, M.D. &c., Physician to the Royal
        Hospital for Diseases of the Chest             820.   Communicated           by
        E. FRANKLAND, F.R.S.           Received September 5, 1867.
    I have    been engaged for several years in experimenting with the secre
tion of the pancreas.                                 I
                              The inquiry of which now make known the re
sults has reference especially to the mode of action of the pancreas upon
fats—a point which has been the subject of investigation by various phy
siologists ever since the discovery of the in<U+FB02>uence of the pancreatic <U+FB02>uid
 on the absorption of fat by Claude Bernard, nearly twenty years ago.
    In the chemical parts of my experiments       I owe much to the ef<U+FB01>cient aid
                        J
 of my friend Mr. uiius Schweitzer, and to the energy and perseverance
 with which he carried out my suggestions under many dif<U+FB01>culties.
    The objects of my investigations have been as follows :—
     I. To discover the exact character and nature of the in<U+FB02>uence exerted
 by the pancreas upon fats.
    2. To discover ameans of obtaining and preserving the active principles
 of the pancreas in a form suitable for experiment in the laboratory, and for
 administration     as a remedial agent.
    3.   To  discover the effects of the administration     of the active principles
 of the pancreas     as a remedial agent in certain wasting     diseases, and to test,
 by an experimenlis crucis, the truth of a conclusion on this subject, at
 which     I had previously arrived by a process of inductive research.
     I  shall not occupy the valuable time of the Society by narrating the
 many more or less unsuccessful experiments,         but restrict     myself to   a con
 cise record of those attended with success.
    Experiments were made with the pancreas of several different animals,
 but that of the pig was selected for the experiments of which             I  am about
 to give the results, as being nearest in the character      of  its functions   to that
 of the human subject.
     In   order   to ascertain the normal reaction of the pancreatic         juice, and

210                  Dr. Dobell     on the Special    Action of              [Dec. 12,
whether this is altered by the length of time that has elapsed since the
last meal, the following experiment was made with the assistance of Mr.
Schweitzer and of Mr. Harris of Calne, who kindly placed his extensive
pig-killing establishment at our service for the purpose.
   On March 22, 1866, forty pigs were killed, and the pancreas of each
examined immediately after death; the killing and examination were so
rapidly conducted, that the pancreas was in each case examined while warm
from the body; and the killing and examination of the forty pigs in sue—
cession occupied less than an hour.
   The pigs were killed ten at a time. The <U+FB01>rst ten had been fed two
hours before they were killed, the second ten <U+FB01>ve hours, the third ten nine
hours, and the fourth ten had not been fed for two days.
   The pancreas in each group presented the same characters in size,
colour, and reaction.    Each pancreas was cut through so as to lay open
the principal duct, but in no case was there any <U+FB02>uid in the duct.    Litmus
paper was applied to the interior of the duct and     to  the divided  gland
cells,   and on being pressed suf<U+FB01>ciently against the tissues to absorb
moisture,   the paper was in each case reddened where it was moistened.
This acid reaction was not found in the fat and muscles of the animal.
   At my request, Dr. Collins, of Albert Terrace, Regent’s Park, examined
the reaction of the pancreas in a series of cases at the moment when all
the digestive organs were under active excitement.    He gave the pigs a
good and relishing meal, and while they were eating                it,
                                                       divided the spinal
marrow in the neck, so as to destroy sensation in the body.       The pigs
were then  immediately cut open, the pancreas removed,  and   its  reaction
examined.     On August 3rd he wrote me, “As you                 requested,
                                                                         I    have tried
a series of experiments upon the pancreas, parotid,              and subliugnal glands.
The two latter have      decidedly acid reaction, but
                            a                                    the pancreasI   am not
quite  so certain about;  in one batch of pigs killed            in Buckinghamshire   it
was alkaline, but in another lot in Hertfordshire           it   was acid:”
  The reaction of the pancreas     always acid when
                                         is             reaches the labora
                                                                  it
tory for experiment as quickly as possible after removal from the animal.
This we have proved in many hundreds of instances.
   To discover the in<U+FB02>uence of the pancreas upon fat, the fresh pancreas of
 the pig, freed from all adhering blood and other extraneous matters, was
 cut into small pieces, bruised, and mixed with lard; and to this mixture
 water was gradually added.     In the bruised condition the pancreas had an
 acid reaction.   By stirring this mixture of pancreas, lard, and water, the
 fatty character disappeared, thick, white, creamy <U+FB02>uid being formed, which,
                                a

                                  a                  This mass had also an
 acid reaction.    In order to free    from the débris of pancreas,

 pressed through muslin, and        a   uniform   smooth creamy emulsion remained.
 This emulsion rapidly putre<U+FB01>ed, but remained           a  permanent emulsion until
 putrefaction     set in.

   The following are the microscopical characters presented                        by pure lard
before mixture with pancreas, and by this emulsion, which                      I    call “ crude
emulsion : "—
   I. “ Lard”    (pure).—A_q_9regations of ordinary acicular crystals of mar
garine.   No oil-globules.    No water.
   2- “ Crude emulsion.”—A tolerahly uniform granular mass with separate
acicular crystals of margarine, oil-globules, and water abundantly distributed
throughout the mass.       In some places the crystals are aggregated as in
No. l. The granules range from the <U+FB01>lm,— to 17%;“ of an inch in dia
meter.
   This mixture of fat and water differs from all other mixtures or che
mical combinations of fat and water in the following particulars.
   When the “crude emulsion” is put into ether, the ether separates it
into two strata—
     a. An ethereal stratum above containing the fat.
        6.    A   watery stratum below.
   When the upper stratum (a) (ethereal solution of fat) is drawn off and
the ether evaporated by a cautiously regulated heat, a pure crystalline fut
remains which I call “pancreatized   fat.” This pancreatized fat has no
tendency to putrefy, and will keep for an inde<U+FB01>nite period.    It presents
the following characters under the microscope :—
   3. “ Pancreatized fat
                         "
                           (lard) consists of minute separate acicular crystals
of margarine and <U+FB01>ne granular matter uniformly distributed.        The special
character is the complete loss of aggregation of the crystals.
  This “ pancreatized fat " retains the property of mixing                     or combining
with water, and forming a thick, smooth, creamy emulsion, that it possessed
in the form of “ crude emulsion ” before solution in ether.     The emulsion
formed by mixture of “pancreatized        fat” with  water   I call “ puri<U+FB01>ed
pancreatic emulsion.”     It has, like the crude emulsion, an acid reaction,
and will keep for a very long time, and presents the following microscopical
characters        :—
   4. “Puri<U+FB01>ed emulsion
                                     ”

                                         (No.   3,
the same as No. 2; the separate crystals more uniformly distributed, and
fewer aggregations of them.    No globules“.      _
   On analysis of the lower watery stratum (6) resulting from the separation
of the fat of the crude emulsion by ether, it is found to contain no gly—
cerine.
  On analysis of the pancreatized              fat (3) obtained by evaporating the
ether from stratum            a, it is found that  100 parts of the pancreatized fat
are saponi<U+FB01>ed by 5-1          parts of oxide of lead, and yield 146'25 parts of lead
plaster, and 6'75 parts of glycerine.
   Itis also found that every 100 parts of lard used in making the crude
emulsion produce 106'5 parts of pancreatized fat, the increase of 6-5 parts
  *   In     cold weather it is necessary     to gently warm the glass slide before placing the
above specimens upon        it,   otherwise the solid constituents become agglomerated.

212             Dr. Dobell   on the  Action of the Pancreas.           [Dec. 12,
being solely due to absorption of water, as proved by heating the pan~
creatized fat, when the water separates, and the pancreatized fat is recon
verted into ordinary lard.
   In all the foregoing respects the pancreatic emulsion of fat differs en
tirely from all other kinds of emulsion of fatty matter, whether chemical
or mechanical.      All other emulsions of fat are destroyed by ether, the fat
being restored at once to its original condition.
   The in<U+FB02>uence exerted by the pancreas upon fats, therefore, appears
to operate by breaking up the aggregation of the crystals of the fat and
altering its hydration.       It alters the molecular condition of the fat,
mingling it with water in such a way that          even  ether   cannot separate
the    fat from   the water.   A permanent emulsion is thus formed ready to
mix with a larger quantity of water whenever it may be added.
    The pancreas, therefore, in acting upon fat, does not decompose it into
fatty acid and glycerine, the absence of the glycerine from the watery
stratum (b), and the presence of the glycerine in the pancreatized fat of the
ethereal stratum (a), having been demonstrated.
    Action of the pancreas upon starch—It is well known that, in addition
to the in<U+FB02>uence of the pancreas upon fat, it has the power of converting
starch into glycose by simple mixture.      This property remains to a certain
extent after the pancreas has exhausted its property of acting upon fat.
The quantity of pancreas which before mixture with fat will convert about
eight parts of starch into glycose, after saturation with fat will still con
vert about two parts of starch into glycose.
    Second object.—-To discover a means of preserving the active principles
of the pancreas in a form suitable for experiment in the laboratory, and
for administration as a remedial agent.
   The properties of the pancreas can be extracted from the tissue of the
gland     by means of water.     This watery <U+FB02>uid putre<U+FB01>es very rapidly. It
has an acid reaction, a deep yellow colour, coagulates largely by boiling,
leaving the colour of the <U+FB02>uid unaltered.       It may be precipitated by lead
solution,    and decomposed again by sulplruretted    hydrogen.
   When this watery <U+FB02>uid is evaporated, it forms a syrupy extract, which is

however, it may bc dried.         For general purposes, the drying is greatly
facilitated    by adding   a dry  absorbing-powder,   such  as   powdered   malt.
For   experimental purposes, it may be‘used in its pure undricd state of
syrupy extract, but must in that case be used fresh.           In the dry state,
either pure or mixed with malt-dust, it may be kept good for an inde<U+FB01>nite
length of time, if protected from moisture in a well—closed        bottle.   This
extract of the pancreas, containing the active principles of the pancreas in
the highest degree of ef<U+FB01>ciency, whether <U+FB02>uid or powdered, I call “ pan

products have failed, no one of such products having been found to
possess in perfection the property of acting upon fat in the manner de—
scribed in this paper as peculiar to the pancreas. By the term “ pancreatine,”
then,   Idesire to represent the entire properties of the pancreas extracted
in a convenient form for keeping, for experiment, and for administration as
a remedial agent.
   One part of the pure pancreatine dried, without mixture with malt-dust,
will digest at least sixteen parts of lard, and enable it to form a thick creamy
emulsion, with about 100 parts of water.           The emulsion thus formed
presents in every respect the characters and qualities of the emulsion pro
duced by the fresh pancreas already described.     In this way therefore the
active principles of the pancreas may be obtained and preserved in a form
suitable for experiment   in the laboratory and for administration as a reme
dial agent.
   The third object of my investigations has especially occupied my atten

the Chest.    Full details of these and of the results obtained have been

        and the Changes of the Moon,” being an extract of a Letter
        from J. H. N. HENNESSEY, Esq., First Assistant on the Great
        Trigonometrical Survey of India, to General SABINE, B.A.,

  Allow me now to say a few words in connexion with the enclosed paper.
There appears to prevail a belief, more or less popular, to the effect that

more rain falls at “ the changes of the moon
days of a lunation.    As I happened to possess a record of the rainfall at
the  of<U+FB01>ce of the   Superintendent of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of
Mussoorie, extending over thirteen consecutive years, I obtained Colonel
Walker’s permission to make use of the register, in connexion with this
popular belief.
   The results tabulated have been obtained by employing an average daily

fall as the means for comparing the fall at “the changes
intermediate intervals.  The method of calculation adopted is explained in
the footnote to the Table.     The annual average result may be stated
thus :—-                                                                                '

Scherer, Hein, Marchand, Heintz, Maly, and Stiideler are mentioned.
Sect. 2. The author then describes the mode of obtaining a red colouring
matter from ox-gallstones.     These coneretions have to be extracted with
water, alcohol,   ether, dilute hydrochloric acid, and ultimately, after re
peated extraction with boiling alcohol and ether, with chloroform.        This
agent dissolves bilirubine or CILOlop/chiIZE, and deposits         it,

and the addition of absolute alcohol, in an amorphous condition, or in                      a

rubine dissolves in ammonia, but does not form any permanent compound
with it. Its combinations with <U+FB01>xed caustic alkalies are insoluble in an

    The calcium compound, on the basis of which Stiideler had assumed
Cw H18 N293 to be the atomic formula of bilirubine, had yielded him (one
analysis) 9'1 per cent. of calcium oxide, therefore less calcium than was found
in the analysis of the half-acid salt, or 6'5 per cent. There is no doubt that
Stiideler had this half-acid compound before him.                 He unfortunately ob
tained the most unstable and uncertain of all the compounds of bilirubine,
and mistook it for a neutral salt, abandoning his former correct analysis
and formula of free bilirubine. With Stiideler’s last formula of bilirubine fall
the formulae of all other substances described by him under the names of
biliverdine, hiliprasin, hilifuscine, and bilihumine.
    The half-acid cholophaeinale of zinc, Cu, H2, Zn Na 08, with ll'05 per
cent. of Zn, and the neutral clzolophwinale of lead, G,Fl Hno Pb N2 0“,
Pb=36'50 per cent., were also obtained.               Basic choloplzazinate of lead is
analogous to the basic silver-salt, as in it two atoms of hydrogen are re
placed by one didynamic atom of lead. Formula=G0 H7Pb N92,Pb=56'25
per cent.
    Some copper compounds were also obtained.
    A new reaction for cholophaeine is given.                 It  consists in dissolving
 the dry powder in fuming sulphuric acid.               A splendid green is at once
 produced.      The substance is not biliverdine, but a product which,
 when isolated,     contains      an atom of water more than           bilirubine,    and is
 C,  HHNOv       and is named cholothalline          by the author.          Cbolothalline
 colours  wool   of a  fast green,    indestructible by acid,  discharged by ammonia.
    Oholophoeine also yields a blue-coloured            substance by treatment with

nitric acid (cholocyanine), of which the peculiar spectrum was determined.
A great number of green, blue, violet, and red bodies can be produced by
appropriate agents, which, if they could be obtained on a large scale, might
<U+FB01>nd technical application.
               II.  On Biliverdine or Cholochlorine         and its Compounds.
    Sect.    1  treats of the mode of obtaining biliverdine.           Cholophaeine is dis
solved      in carbonate     of potassium, and warmed while a current of air is
passed through it.           When the solution is green, it is precipitated with
hydrochloric acid. The precipitated biliverdine is easily soluble in alcohol.
Sect. 2 describes the physical properties of biliverdine, as a non-crystalline
splendidly green substance, the solution of which gives no particular absorp
tion phenomena in the spectrum.              Sect 3 gives the elementary analyses and
theory of biliverdine, which led to the formula C, HB NO,. Thus it was
shown that it originated from cholophzeine by the addition of oxygen and
subsequent subtraction of carbonic acid.
                           Cn HD N02+2O=C5 H9 NOQ+COT
    Sect. 4. treats of the compounds of biliverdine.            The calcium-salt was not
obtained pure.          The barium-salt appeared to be C“ Hy, Ba N30,, and was
precipitated       by baryta-water from an alcoholic solution of biliverdine.            It
consequently        consisted  of  one   atom   of  the   neutral   salt  with an  atom  of
biliverdine and one of water.           Lead and copper compounds were also ob
tained.        No insoluble silver-salt could      be obtained.     The addition of oxide
of   silver to an alcoholic      solution  caused a reaction, consisting in an oxida
tion of the biliverdine.
    A    new reaction for biliverdine       is stated.     When dissolved in alcoholic
ammonia, and boiled with an ammoniacal solution of silver nitrate, silver is
deposited, and on addition of an acid a splendid purple matter is produced
(bilipurpiue).                                                                       .
   Of     these new substances and others the author             hopes to treat in future
communications.
   Chlorine and other substitution-products             are also mentioned.
   The foregoing        contributions   will  make    the  chemistry of the bile in the
main complete.           Human bile contains cholophaaine, but most commonly
by the side of it bilifuscine, a brown substance to be treated of hereafter.

cholophaeine and biliverdine have shown that they have no apparent rela
tion to hematine, as was formerly supposed, the analyses of uromelanine
have made it probable that this substance is a derivative of the coloured part
of the blood, cruorine or hematocrystalline,           not, however, of hematine,
for the atomic weight of hematine is apparently smaller than that of uro
melauine.       But crystallized cruorine has an atomic weight of about l3,000
(Fe=0'45 per cent.). From such abody urochrome, including as it does
uromelanine, uropittine,        omicholine, and perhaps other matters (to be
described in future communications), might be derived with an atomic
weight of perhaps 1500, being itself near that of albumen (1612), but
unable to derive from it.        The author thinks it possible that the quantity
of blood-disintegration might be measured by determining the amount of
uromelanine obtainable from given quantities of'urine excreted in given times.
 In any case uromelanine is one of the most remarkable substances in the
 whole domain of organic and animal chemistry, and the further             study of
its metamorphoses cannot fail to yield highly interesting results.

     Amongst the physical properties which point out the general relation
  ship and classi<U+FB01>cation of chemical compounds, none has so deservedly ob
 tained the con<U+FB01>dence of chemists as isomorphism.              The vanadium com
 pounds have, however, proved a remarkable and unexplained exception to
 the conclusions     which generally follow from well ascertained identity of
  crystalline form.    Rammelsberg, and afterwards, more completely, Schabus,
  pointed   out  the fact  that the mineral vanadinite from several localities (a
  compound of lead vanadate and lead chloride) is isomorphous with apatite,
  pyrornorphite, and mimetesite, minerals consisting of calcium phosphate
  chloride, lead phosphato-chloride,       and lead arsenato-chloride.
     The crystalline form of' all these minerals is an hexagonal prism, termi
  nated by 6-sided pyramids.          So far indeed has the isomorphism of these

compounds      been traced, that in many specimens these minerals have been
found to crystallize together in all proportions; and Heddle describes a
crystal in his possession, the upper half of which consists of vanadinite and
the lower half of pyromorphite.
    Our knowledge concerning the chemical composition of the oxides of va
nadium is derived from the accurate analytical results of Berzelius, to whose
celebrated research (1831) on vanadium we are indebted for almost all we
know of this metal and its compounds. From these experiments, more or less
completely con<U+FB01>rmed by Schafarik and Czudnowicz, it appears that the for
mula of vanadic acid is V 03. Hence it is evident that we have here to do with
either a case of dissimilarly constituted substances acting as isomorphous
bodies and erystallizing together, or else the conclusions of Berselius are
mistaken, and the true formula of vanadic acid is V,O,, corresponding to
phosphorus and arsenic pentoxides. The <U+FB01>rst of these alternatives has been
properly accepted by most chemists as the only present solution of the dif
<U+FB01>culty, inasmuch as the de<U+FB01>nite experimental data given by Berzelius ren
der the assumption of any other formula but VOs for vanadic acid perfectly
gratuitous   in the absence of experiments proving these data to be erroneous.
  _
    Berzelius based his conclusions on the following experiments, viz.
(l)   the constant loss of weight which vanadic acid undergoes on reduction
in hydrogen      at a red heat; (2) the action of chlorine on this reduced
oxide, when a volatile chloride      is formed and a residue of vanadic acid re
mains,    which is found to be exactly one-third of the quantity originally
taken    for reduction in hydrogen.        Hence Berzelius concludes that the
number of atoms of oxygen in the oxide is to that in the acid in the pro
portion of l to 3; so that (assuming the lowest oxide to contain one
atom of oxygen) the acid contains three atoms of oxygen, a result
 which he <U+FB01>nds borne out by its capacity of saturation.            The question
whether the acid contains one or two atoms of metal Berzelius decides in
favour of the former view, by <U+FB01>nding that no compound corresponding to
the alums is formed when vanadic acid is brought together with sulphuric
acid and potash.       The analyses of the volatile chloride made both by Ber
zelius and Schafarik     con<U+FB01>rm    this conclusion, and place beyond all doubt
the fact that,    if the atomic  weight of vanadium be taken to be 685 and
0:8,     the formula of vanadic acid is V03, that of the oxide prepared by
reduction V0, and that of the chloride VCia.
    In the present communication the author, whilst con<U+FB01>rming these funda
mental results in every particular, still arrives at a totally di<U+FB02>'erent conclu
sion from Berzellus respecting the constitution of vanadic acid and all the
other vanadium compounds;         for he proves that the true formula of vanadic
acid is V205, when    0:   16, and the true atomic weight of vanadium   V: 51-2,
inasmuch     as the substance supposed     to be vanadium   is not the metal but

    The following are the grounds upon which these conclusions are based;
the experimental proofs are contained in the memoir :—
     (1) An oxide of vanadium exists having the atomic weight 67'? (that of
        the metal of Berzelius).             Hence vanadic acid contains more than
        three atoms of oxygen.
     (2) The following vanadium oxides have been obtained, both in the dry
        and wet way, and their composition determined :—
             (1)  VO *, vanadium        monoxide, or vanadyl                      =      67'2

     (3) The      so—called     terchloride of vanadium, VCl3(V= 67'2), contains
        oxygen;       it is an oxychloride having the formula VOCl3 (V=5l'2) ;
        it may    be called vanadyl trichloride,         or vanadium oxytrichloride,      and
        corresponds to POC13, phosphoryl              trichloride.
    (4) Three other solid oxychlorides             exist, having the composition
            (lst)    VOC12,    vanadyl    dichloride,    or vanadium oxydichloride.
            (2nd)    VOCl,    vanadyl    monochloride,      or vanadium oxymonochloride.

     (5) All the native vanadates are tribasic.
                                                                                    -
    (6) Vanadium pentoxide fused with sodium carbonate displaces three
        molecules of carbon dioxide, showing that normal or ortho-sodium
        vanadate is tribasic, the formula of this salt being Naavo‘.
    (7) The so-called monovanadates are salts corresponding to the mono
        basic phosphates, and may be termed metavanadates;                    thus, NaVOg,
        NH ,voa, BaQVOa.              The so-called hivanadates are           anhydro-salts,
       similar     in constitution      to the anhydro-salts        of chromic and boric
        acids.
    (8)    Vanadium        nitride has been prepared, which, on analysis, was
        shown to contain          51'2 parts by weight of vanadium to 14 parts of
       nitrogen.
    All  the reactions according to which vanadic acid was supposed (Berzelius,
Rammelsberg, Schafarik) to contain three atoms of oxygen with an atomic
weight V=67'2, can equally well be explained when V205 (V=5l'2) is
taken to represent the composition of this substance.                   That this is the case
is seen from the following :—

those of the solid     oxychlorides, may be a multiple of the above.      Further experiment

are an exception to the law of even atoxuicities.                              .

        II.  Occurrence and Preparation     of the Vanadium    Compounds.
     The sources of vanadium have hitherto yielded the compounds of this
 metaLin extremely small quantities, and consequently our knowledge of the
 substance is but limited.     The attention of the author was drawn to the
 occurrence of vanadium in some of the copper-bearing         beds of the Lower
  Keuper Sandstone of the Trias, worked at Alderley Edge and Mottram St.
 Andrews, in Cheshire.       He obtained a large quantity ofa lime precipitate,
 c0ntaining nearly 2 per cent. of vanadium, obtained in working up a poor
 cobalt-ore from hIottram in a mine now closed.        The precipitate, contain
 ing mainly   arsenic, iron, lead, copper, vanadium, and lime, with sulphuric
 and phosphoric acids, was <U+FB01>rst well furnaced with ground coal, to drive off
 the greater portion of the arsenic, and then roasted with one-quarter of its
 weight of soda-ash, so as to convert the vanadium into a soluble vanadate,
 and on lixiviation arsenic and the heavy metals were completely thrown
 down by sulphuretted hydrogen.        The deep-blue solution was neutralized
 by ammonia, the precipitated vanadium oxide dried and oxidized by nitric
acid, and the crude vanadium pentoxide thus obtained boiled out with a satu
 rated solution ot'ammonium carbonate. The slightly soluble ammonium vana
 date was washed and recrystallized.   In order to prepare purevanadium pent
 oxide from this salt it was roasted, and the powder thus obtained suspended
 in water into which ammonia gas was passed.          The dissolved ammonium
 vanadate was separated by <U+FB01>ltration from a residue containing silica, phos
phates, &c.     The pentoxide obtained by heating this salt was free from
phosphorus.      A second method of preparing the pure vanadium pentoxidc
consists in decomposing the pure oxychloride in water, and freeing the pent
oxide from any traces of silica by exposure to hydro<U+FB02>uoric-acid gas.       Great
dif<U+FB01>culty was experienced in obtaining vanadium free      from  phosphorus ; all
the native vanadates contain large quantities of phosphorus.       The action of
traces of this substance upon vanadium pentoxide is remarkable; l per
cent. of phosphoric    acid renders crystalline vanadium pentoxide black and
amorphous,     whilst the presence of the merest trace altogether prevents the
reduction   of the pentoxide in hydrogen.
1“.    Atomic Weight determination of Vanadium by reduction        of Vanadium
                             Pentoxide in Hydrogen.
    This method was the one originally employed by Berzelius.          It is per
fectly reliable, and yields accurate results when carried out with care and
due regard to the necessary precautions, which are detailed in the me
moir.
    In drying the pure hydrogen gas only sulphuric acid can be used, as
phosphorus pentoxide used in the last drying-tube was found invariably to
be carried over into the boat containing the substance ; and the presence of
a trace of phosphoric     acid renders the complete reduction to scsquioxide
impossible.

    Hence the mean atomic weight from these experiments is 51'37, with a
 mean error of          0066. Berzelius’s number, calculated according to the
above equation, is 52'55.             The difference is probably owing to the fact
that his vanadium         contained a trace of phosphorus,              which prevented the
complete reduction,

     (l)    Vanadium      lilonomide, VO=67'2.——In its power of uniting with
oxygen      vanadium     surpasses uranium, as observed by Peligot; and as this
 oxide is found to enter into many of its compounds, the name Vanadyl may
 appropriately be given to it.
    Vanadium monoxide is a grey powder possessing a metallic lustre, and
is obtained by passing the vapour of vanadyl trichloride, mixed with
 excess of hydrogen, through a combustion-tube                   containing red~hot carbon.
    This oxide may be prepared in solution by the action of nascent hydro
 gen, evolved by metallic zinc, cadmium, or sodium amalgam, upon a solu
 tion of vanadic acid in sulphuric acid.                After passing through all shades
 of blue    and   green,  the  liquid   attains     a  permanent lavender tint, and con
 tains the vanadium          in solution as monoxide.              This compound absorbs
 oxygen with such avidity as to bleach indigo and other vegetable colouring
 matters as quickly as chlorine, and far more powerfully than any other
 known reducing agent.            The degree of oxidation of the dissolved vanadium
 was estimated by a standard             solution      of permanganate, which had been

   1867.]                    Prof. Roscoe  on Vanadium.                            225
  proved to give accurate results with a vanadium oxide of known composi
  tion, the point of maximum oxidation being obtained when the solution
   became pink.      According to this method, 100 parts of vanadium pentoxide
   were shown to have lost 26'53 per cent. of oxygen on reduction with zinc            ;
   the percentage loss from V20, to V202 is 26-3.
      When the neutral lavender-coloured solution of a monoxide salt is allowed
   to stand exposed to the air for a few seconds, the colour changes toadeep
   chocolate-brown     from absorption of oxygen ; indeed this reaction for
   oxygen is as delicate as that of an alkaline pyrogallate.        If air be passed
  ‘through the acid lavender-coloured solution of vanadous sulphate, oxygen
   is absorbed, and the liquid assumes a permanent blue colour, and the vaun
   dium is contained in solution as dioxide.       If the free acid contained in the
  lavender solution be neutralized     by zinc, the liquid on exposure to air at
  tains a permanent brown tint, which, on addition of acids, becomes green,
   and the solution contains sesquioxide.
      (2) Vanadium Sesquioa'izle, V203=l50'4 (Berzelius’s suboxide).—Ohs
   tained   as a black    powder by reducing vanadium pentoxide in hydrogen
   at red heat.     When exposed warm to the air it glows, absorbs oxygen,
   and passes into the highest oxide.         At the ordinary atmospheric tem
   perature it slowly absorbs oxygen, and is converted into dioxide.             Vanas
   dium sesquioxide is insoluble in acids, but may be obtained in solution by
   the reducing action of nascent hydrogen evolved from metallic magnesium
   upon a solution of vanadic acid in sulphuric acid.         The changes of colour
   observed in the case of the monoxide solutions do not continue beyond the
   green, and the liquid contains vanadium in solution as sesquioxide.              100
   parts of vanadium pentoxide      were found   to  lose, on  reduction    with  mag
   nesium, 177 per cent. of oxygen; the loss on reduction to V20, is 17'5
   per cent.    Solutions of vanadium sesquioxide can also be obtained by par
'
   tial oxidation of the lavender-coloured solution containing monoxide.
      Chlorine attacks the sesquioxide in the manner <U+FB01>rst pointed out by Ber
   zelius according to the formula 3 (V,O,)+GCI,=V,O,+4(V001,).
     (3) Vanadium Dioxide, VO,=83'2 (the vanadic oxide ofBerzelius).——This
   oxide was obtained      by Berzelius by precipitation     from its salts.    It may
   also he prepared     in the form of blue shining crystals by allowing the
   sesquioxide   to absorb oxygen at ordinary temperatures.            It is contained
   in solutions, having    a bright blue colour, prepared by the action of mode
   rate reducing agents, such as sulphur dioxide and sulphuretted hydrogen,
   oxalic acid, &c., upon vanadic acid in solution.          100 parts of vanadium
   pentoxide were found to lose, on reduction with the two <U+FB01>rst-named agents,
   9'03 per cent. ; the loss on reduction to YOa is 8‘75.       Solutions containing
  the    dioxide are obtained by passing air through acid solutions of the
   monoxide until a permanent blue colour is attained.
      (4) Vanadium Pentos'ide, VQO5 (vanadic acid= 182'4).—The properties
  of this oxide and its compounds are considered only so far          as is necessary
   for the elucidation of the true atomic weight of the metal.

   In considering the conditions for the existence of given systems of
 equalities between the roots of an equation, we obtain some very interesting
 examples of the composition of relations.     A relation is either onefold,
 expressed by a single equation               U=0,     or it         is,
                                                                say, k-fold, expressed                          by   a
 system of   or more equations.
               k                                  Of  course, as regards onefold relations,
the theory of the composition               is   well known: the relation UV=0           re               is   a
lation compounded of the relations U=0,                              V=0   ;   that      is,   it   is

relations            satis<U+FB01>ed.  The like notion of composition applies to relations
in general; viz., the compound relation         relation satis<U+FB01>ed
                                                                is   and not

satis<U+FB01>ed.   The author purposely_refrains at present from any further dis
cussion of the theory of composition.    The conditions for the existence of
given systems of equalities between the roots of an equation furnish in
stances of such composition; in fact,        we express that the function

common quadric factor, we obtain between the coef<U+FB01>cients   certain twofold               a
relation,  which implies either that the equation (*Iz', y)"=0 has three
 equal roots, or else that     has two pairs of equal roots

                                      (Abstract.)
     To explain the true nature of the phenomenon of drops of blood pro
pelled in rapid succession, as      if from the caudal heart, along the caudal
veiu,—to prove thereby that the caudal heart belongs, not to the blood
vascular system, but to the lymphatic system,—and to inquire into the in
 <U+FB02>uence which the force of the lymph-stream from the caudal heart exerts in
accelerating and promoting       the <U+FB02>ow of blood in the caudal vein, constitute
 the object of this paper.
     The great caudal vein of the    eel is formed by the  junction of two trunks, a
 larger and a smaller.    It is into the smaller   trunk, near its junction with the
 larger, that the caudal heart opens.        At the opening, there is a valve which
 prevents regurgitation of the lymph back from the vein into the heart.
     When by the contraction of the heart the lymph is propelled into the
 vein, the <U+FB02>ow of blood from that vessel into the great caudal trunk is
 interrupted by the force of the lymph-stream.           From the place where the
 heart opens into the vein to the junction of the latter with the caudal
 trunk, colourless lymph thus replaces red blood; whilst in the caudal
 trunk itself, the lymph, still under the in<U+FB02>uence of the heart’s force, so far
  displaces the blood as to <U+FB02>ow in a colourless stream on one side of the
  vessel for some distance, distinct from and unmingled with the blood
  stream from the lower part of the vein and its lateral branches.
      During the diastole of the heart, the stream of lymph into the vein in
  termitting,   the <U+FB02>ow of blood from that vessel into the great trunk of the
  caudal vein again takes place.        No sooner, however, has a small quantity
  of blood entered than, systole of the heart ensuing, the stream of lymph
  thereby propelled into the vein, drives the small quantity of blood before
  it into the great caudal venous trunk, whilst it at the same time arrests, as
  before, the <U+FB02>ow of blood into the great caudal vein from its tributary vessel.
      Through the medium of the stream of lymph propelled into the great.
  caudal vein at each stroke of the caudal heart, an impetus is communicated
   to the column of blood in that vessel, which we can see has the effect of acce
   lerating and promoting. its onward <U+FB02>ow to the blood-heart of the animal.
      We thus see that the caudal heart of the eel is a lymphatic heart, its

function being to receive lymph on the one hand, and to propel it into the
 great vein of the tail on the other, but that, besides this function, it at the
same time performs the secondary one of accelerating and promoting the <U+FB02>ow
 of the blood in the great caudal vein in its course back to the blood-heart.
     So far as the author has been able to ascertain, no one has hitherto given
 a correct explanation of the phenomenon of small drops of blood prOpelled
 in rapid succession, as      from the caudal heart, along the caudal vein.
 “’ithout <U+FB01>rst showing that these small drops of red blood are not propelled
from the caudal heart, and without showing that it is colourless lymph
 alone which is really propelled therefrom, no one could be warranted in
  dissenting from Dr. Marshall Hall, the discoverer of the caudal heart, in
 his opinion as to the nature of the organ, viz. that it is an auxiliary blood
 heart, or in pronouncing     it,

ing-paper, a well-arranged light, and no necessity of changing position.         I
made in this manner the drawing of Gassendi which is marked No. 2.
    My next attempt was made in the same situation with a <U+FB01>ne tele
scope by Cooke,     of (ii-inch aperture and 11 feet sidereal focus, mounted
equatorially, in the old English mode, and carried by clockwork.             With
this excellent arrangement      I was enabled to use photography very success
fully, and to obtain selenographs 2 inches across in 5' of time. The draw
ing of Gassendi, No. 3, was made with this instrument (1853).
    From these experiments the conclusion was obvious :—that for obtaining
 good drawings of the moon, convenient mounting was actually more im
portant than great optical power; and that for such a purpose it was desi
rable to increase in every way the comfort of the observer, and furnish him
with special arrangements for his own pesition and the placing of his draw
ing-board    and light.
    Having been called to reside in Oxford (1853-54), my plan for con
tinual work on the moon was entirely out through; it was impossible to
mount a large instrument near my dwelling till (in 1860) the ground was
arranged about the museum, so as to give me the requisite space and secu
rity close to the house which had been appointed for me by the Univer
sity.    I then arranged with Mr. Cooke for a new telescope of 6 inches
aperture, to be protected in a well-planned observatory, the construction of
which was aided by the Royal Society.            I  now propose to give a short
notice of some of the results of my work with this instrument, in connexion
with remarks on the most advisable course to be followed by other surveyors
of  the moon.
    In making    drawings of ring-mountains on different parts of the moon’s
disk, the artist will  be much aided by a projection of the mountain-border
on the scale intended, from afew measures, with its proper <U+FB01>gure due to
the latitude and longitude.       Eye—drafts not thus controlled are apt to be
come absurd,     by the heedless substitution      of an ideal  circle for a  real
ellipse.    Thus  I have seen Gassendi forgetfully represented by more than
one skilful artist.    Even with the advantage of such a projection (of which
I give   an example for Gassendi, No. 5) very considerable dif<U+FB01>culties occur.
One is the variation of outline caused by the displacement of the boundary
of light and shade—<U+FB01>rst when the incidence of light varies through di<U+FB02>'erent
angles of elevation of the sun, and next when the moon’s position causes
her to receive the light at the point observed on a different lunar azimuth.
Even on so great a ring as Copernicus the variation of the outline as given
by different artists is remarkable—hardly any one agreeing with what is
really the most accurate drawing of all, that by P. Secchi ; and that repre—
sents,  not a simple ring, but a seven-angled outline.       Dates must always
be annexed to the <U+FB01>gures; and as it is rarely possible to complete a good
drawing of a large crater, except in two or three lunations or more, it
becomes very essential that a bold free sketch be made of the moon’s
shadows to control the special work.       (No. 6 is given as an example.)

  Strictly speaking, there should he at least three drawings of a ring
mountain—in morning light, at midday, and in evening.       It would be
better to have <U+FB01>ve drawings,            one at sunrise and another          at sunset being
added     to the three     already   named.           It will   be found   most convenient
to make the drawings within two hours of the moon’s meridian passage.
   Shadows thrown from objects on the moon have exactly the same
character as those observable on the earth.   They are all margined by
the penumbra due to the sun’s diametral aspect ; this is always traceable ex
cept very near to the object; but in consequence of the smaller dia
meter and more rapid curvature of the moon’s surface, the penumbral
space is narrower.   At the boundary of light and shade, on a broad
grey level tract, the penumbral space is about nine miles broad, quite
unde<U+FB01>ned, of course, but perfectly sensible in the general effect, and worthy
of special attention while endeavouring to trace the minute ridges (of
gravel ?) or smooth banks (of sand              i),
                                       which make some of these surfaces
resemble the postglacial plains of North Germany, or central Ireland, or
the southern parts of the United States, which within thousand centuries
                                                                     a
may have been deserted by the            sea.
     To   the same cause   is              and transitory extension of half
                                due the curious
lights over some portions of the interior of craters, while other neighbour
ing portions have the full light. The effect          occasionally to produce
                                                                is
half-tints on particular portions of terraces within the crater, as in the
case of Theophilus, of which     present two drawings, one showing this
                                  I
peculiarity in the morning light, the other not. The central mountains of
that great crater are high enough to throw long shadows; and these, as
they catch upon other peaks or spread, softening with distance, over the
surrounding plains, present far greater variety of shadow-tones than might
be expected on     aglobe de<U+FB01>cient, as the moon really appears to be, of
both air and water.
   The different parts of the moon’s surface re<U+FB02>ect light very unequally;
the dark parts have several degrees of darkness, the light parts several
degrees of light.  On the same level, as nearly as can be judged, under
the same illumination, neighbouring parts are not only unequally re<U+FB02>ective,
but their light seems to be of different tints.    Within the large area of
Gassendi, under various angles    of illumination,  but more conspicuously
when the angle of incidence deviates least from verticality, patches of the
surface appear distinctly marked out by difference of tint, without shadow.
It    well known that in this particular photography has disclosed curious
     is
and unexpected differences of the light, which were not apparent, or not so
obvious, to the eye.   Re<U+FB02>ecting telescopes seem to be indicated as most
suited for direct observation of differences of the kind of light on the moon.
   The surface of the moon       hardly anywhere really smooth, hardly any

minute          puckerings, and small monticules appear and disappear in almost
every part.           In several of the maria, minute angular cup-craters about half
a mile across are frequent; and on several of the exterior slopes of the
crater-rings         are seen pits,     ridges,  <U+FB01>ssures,   and rude craters,     something
like the sloping surfaces of Etna.                Copernicus is a good example of this
 common occurrence.               It  appears extremely desirable that the details of
 this magni<U+FB01>cent mountain should be carefully reexamined on the basis
 of Secchi’s <U+FB01>ne drawing, for the purpose, amongst others, of determining
 exactly how many of the bosses and ridges bear cup-hillocks ; for many
 inequalities, which in feeble telescopes have but the indistinct character of
 being heaped up, appear distinctly crateriform with superior optical power *.
      On the very crest of a ring-mountain it is rare to <U+FB01>nd a cup-crater;
 quite common to <U+FB01>nd them in the interior, especially towards the middle,
 and, in several cases, exactly central.            But it happens often that the central
 mountain-mass of a large crater, such as Gassendi and Theophilus, is of a
  different structure.          In the former a complicated digitated mass of elevated
  land       appeared to me for a long time to be entirely devoid of any small
  craters; by continued scrutiny at last             I  see on one of the masses a distinct
  depression.          The  area  in  Gassendi    reminded    me of the volcanic region of
  Auvergne, in which, with many crater-formed mountains, occur also the
  Puy de Dome, Puy Sarcoui, Puy Chopin, and others which are heaps of a
  peculiar trachyte not excavated at the top, while the others aretformed of
   ashes       and lava-streams      and are all crateriform.        The central    masses    of
   Theophilus (Nos.          7, 8, and 9) are very lofty and grandly <U+FB01>ssured from the
   the middle outwards, with long excurrent buttresses on one side, and many
   rival peaks separating deep hollows, and catching the light on their small
   apparently        not excavated tops.        This is like the upheaved volcanic region
   of Mont d’Or, with its radiating valleys, wide in the central part, and con
   tracted to gorges toward the outside of the district.
       The Vesuvian volcanic system, including the Phlegraean <U+FB01>elds, exhibits,
   in all respects but magnitude, remarkable analogy with parts of the moon
   studded with craters of all magnitudes, as those adjoining Mount Mauroly
   cus, engraved for comparison by Mr. Scrope in his admirable treatise on
   Volcanos (p. 232). It is probable that many of the differences which ap
   pear on comparing lunar ring-mountains may be understood as the effects
   of long elapsed time, degrading some craters before others were set up, and
   turning regular cones and cavities into confused luminous mounds.                           It
   would        much    augment    our    con<U+FB01>dence    in the possible history of the moon
   which these differences seem to indicate, if we could believe it to have
    ever been under the in<U+FB02>uence of atmospheric vicissitude as well as changes
    of interior pressure.
        That the latter cause has been in great activity at some early period
    of the moon’s history is not only evident, by the many sharply cut <U+FB01>s

I. “Contributions         towards determining the Weight of the Brain in
       the different Races of Man.”             By Josnrrr BARNARD Davrs,
       M.D. &c.        Communicated by Prof.       J 01m MARSHALL.        Received
       November 30, 1867.
                                      (Abstract.)
   It  would naturally be expected that great attention had been directed
to   the    human brain, the organ of mental manifestation.              Still little
has been done to ascertain its relative magnitude in the different races of
mankind. Opportunities for examining exotic brains are rare, and it is only
by gauging the internal capacities of human              skulls, and deducing the
weight of the brain, that data can be obtained.
   The inferiority of this method is not      so clear as has been assumed, since
we are able to <U+FB01>x upon an unchangeable substance of de<U+FB01>nite speci<U+FB01>c
gravity for the purpose of this gauging, whereby we compensate for the
variable condition of the brain, depending upon disease and other causes,
                                                      '
and the immediate occasion of death.
   The great dif<U+FB01>culty hitherto has been to decide upon a de<U+FB01>nite allowance,
or scale of allowance for other matters besides brain which always <U+FB01>ll up
the cavity of the skull, in different proportions at different ages, &c.           In
the present investigations it has been considered most advisable to <U+FB01>x upon
a de<U+FB01>nite, and at the same time proportionate, rule for compensating for
these <U+FB02>uids and membranes.           And, after much inquiry, that rule has been
laid down      as a general tare of 15 per cent. on the capacity af the skull.
    In  former inquiries of this kind by Prof. Tiedemann and Prof. Morton,
 this allowance has been entirely or almost entirely overlooked, by which
means their extended observations really refer to the internal capacities of
 human skulls, and not to the weights of the brain, as they supposed.             No

 doubt internal capacities themselves become          a legitimate  means of com
parison.
    Synostotic and arti<U+FB01>cially deformed skulls are mostly included, for the
reason speci<U+FB01>ed, that their internal capacities are usually not materially
interfered with.
    Morton    also failed to distinguish the sexes, and his Tables give no
indication   how many of the skulls were those of men and how many those
of women. \Vhen we recollect the great normal diversity in the size of the
brain in the two sexes in any given race, this omission becomes of serious
 importance.       In the series of skulls now examined, this diversity in the
weight   of  the  brain in the two sexes extends from less than 10 per cent. to
something more than 12% per cent. ; so that Prof. Welcker’s datum of 10
per cent. is tolerably correct.      In our measurements the sexes are marked,
and adult examples only included.           All the crania have been carefully
and as uniformly as possible <U+FB01>lled with dry Calais sand of a de<U+FB01>nite speci<U+FB01>c
weight, which has been afterwards weighed and then reduced to its equiva
lent in cerebral matter of 1040 speci<U+FB01>c gravity, after the deduction of
the 15 per cent. The observations on the weight of the brain in all the
races have been arranged in seven Tables, corresponding very nearly to the
races of the great divisions of the globe.           The results show that Prof.
Tiedemann       was misled when he hastily assumed that, inasmuch as a
certain size and mass of brain was an essential condition for the exercise of
 the faculties of the mind, all human races are furnished therewith in an
equal degree.
    One important object has always been kept in view—namely, a careful
comparison of the calculated observations of the Tables with the actual de
terminations of those who have weighed the brains of different races, as far
as such determinations have extended.          This has been done with the view
of  comparing     and correcting our results.
    It would   be  dif<U+FB01>cult to give any intelligible abstract of the Tables which
accompany     the memoir.      Of the notes to these Tables some short account
may be given here.
    Dr. Peacock and other excellent and careful observers pretty nearly coin
cide in the conclusion that the brain of Englishmen, on the average, is about
49 oz. av. in weight, or 1389 grammes. Dr. Robert Boyd, in his memoir in
the Philosophical Transactions, states as the result oflzis vast experience,that
the adult male brain among the insane varied from 48'1702. to 4387 oz. ;
among the insane women from 44'55 oz. to 40'55 oz.; whilst in the same
adults the averages varied in the men from 48-20 oz. to 45'34 oz., and
 among the women from 43-70 oz. to 39'77 oz.             It thus appears that Dr.
Boyd's investigations        bring out an average brain-weight among the
English of, speaking roundly, about 5 oz. less than Dr. Peacock’s means,
and rather more than 3 oz. less than our means.            Dr. Thurnam, who ex
amined and weighed the brains of 257 insane men and 213 insane women,
agrees in his results with Dr. Boyd, being still rather below the averages

brain-weight   for the English of 47‘50 02., or 1346 grrns., which agrees

series of measurements by Prof.   Broca  of  357 French crania, those of men

   The skulls of Italians, of Lapps, and of Swedes agree in giving brain                  a

size of these German skulls, as well  as in some   degree  from   the great pre
 dominance  of men’s skulls; for Prof. Huschke, who weighed upwards of
 60 brains of Germans, two-thirds being those of men, found the mean
 weight to be no more than 1384 grms.        Prof. Rudolph Wagner also tested
 by the balance 31 brains   of  Germans,   the  larger half being those of men,
 and obtained    mean of only 1300 grms., itself suf<U+FB01>ciently large weight.

 In the investigations of Prof. Welcker, who employed 30 adult normal
 skulls of men and 30 of women, the mean brain-weight of the series rises
 only to 42'83 02., or 1214 grins.      This seems to be conclusive that our
                      skulls,  and that  the size of the German brain has been

 somewhat overrated.    The result‘of further investigation will probably be
 to correct these discrepancies.
    In entering upon the decidedly brachycephalic races of Europe, must                   it
 be noted that we have for our examination the skulls of men only, and those
 in small numbers, which will prevent any accurate comparison with the
 rest of the series.   The mean brain-weight of two male Poles              47'14 02.,

Vedaha of Ceylon and the Hindoos.               The mean obtained from 35 crania
of   males of Hindoo Tribes is 4422 oz., or 1253 grms. ; that from those of
31 females 39'99 oz., or 1 133 grms.,—which yields a mean of the two sexes
of    42-11 oz., or   1193 grms.      A   reference   to Dr.  Morton’s observations
shows that      his series, when     properly calculated by our rule, give a still
lower mean, viz. 41'74 oz., or 1183 grms.
     The skulls of Muesulmen afford a slightly increased average of brain
weight over those of Hindoos. This perhaps might have been anticipated.
     The two skulls of male Khonds, one of the unquestioned aboriginal
races of India, show a brain-weight of 3787 oz., or 1073 grms.
     As we ascend the Himalayan SIOpe we reach races who have a somewhat
increased volume of brain.         The Lepchaa, Bodoa, and Bhotias range about
 46 oz.
     And when we reach what have been called the Indo-Chinese races, the
 brain-weight becomes again more considerable.             The mean of the Siamese
 is 47-14 oz., or 1336 grms., that of the Chinese 47'00 oz., or 1332 grms.,
 and that of the Burmese 47'87 oz., or 1357 grms.
      Of the races of Japan only two crania of true Japanese have been ob
 tained; but of the aboriginal Ainos, of the Island of Yesso, the brain
 weight,    as deduced from four skulls,      is 45'83 oz., or 1299 grms.
      The general average     of the  Asiatic Table shows a diminution, when com
 pared with that of the European.           The numbers are, for the latter, 468?
  oz., or 1328 grms., and for the former, 44'6‘2 oz., or 1266 grms., which is a
  diminution of more than two ounces, or 62 grms.
      At the commencement of the AFRICAN Races we encounter the Barbers
  and the Guano/tea, the former inhabitants of Teneri<U+FB01>'e.           These are people
  with rather small brains.          The general mean amounts to 43'49 oz., or
   1233 grms.
      Of the Continental    people, the Negroes of Tribes unknown give a slightly
  increased brain-weight of 44-08 oz., or 1249 grms.           The Dahomans rise to
  a mean of 4634011., or 1313 grms., and the Bakeles, awarlike tribe on
  the Equator, to an equally high brain-weight.            A brain of an adult Negro,
   weighed by Dr. Peacock, was found to weigh 45'50 oz., or 1289 grms.
   Another, examined by Dr. Edmond Simon, was found to weigh, with the
   membranes, 1226 grms.
       In passing to the more Southern          portions of the African continent we
   <U+FB01>nd the races much contrasted in respect of their brain-weights.              The
   Ka<U+FB01>r skulls, seven-eighths of which are those of men, present a mean of
   48'l6oz., or 1365 grms., whilst that of the small Bushmans reaches only
   to 39'70 oz., or 1125 grins.
       In Prof. Marshall’s     valuable   and elaborate account of the Brain of a
   Bushwoman       in the Philosophical Transactions, there is a careful calcu
   lation of the original weight of the brain, which, by means of experiment
   upon human brains subjected to the action of spirits of wine, he was able
    to restore to its original weight   ; and he decided this to have been 30'75 oz.,

 or 875 grms.       Prof. Marshall afterwards gauged the capacity of the skull
 by <U+FB01>lling it with water, which he has given.           He found it to be 60-64
 cubic inches.     With this capacity given, it is easy to determine that the
 weight of the brain would have been 31'01 oz. according to our rule.       Prof.
 Marshall’s calculation very closely approximates to this, viz. 30-75 oz., or
 onlya quarter of an ounce di<U+FB01>'erent. This case, in which the brain-weight
 was restored and the skull was also gauged, seems to be a good instance
 for testing the accuracy of our method; and the result appears to prove
 that it may be relied upon with much con<U+FB01>dence.
    The general mean of our African Races is less than that of European
 Races,—a result which is not in agreement with Tiedemann’s conclusions.
 It is rather more than two and a half ounces less than our European mean.
    In passing to the AMERICAN Races we have placed <U+FB01>rst the Esquimaum
 of the whole Arctic Circle.      They present the large general mean brain
weight of46'56 oz., or 1319 grms.
   A series of mostly individual skulls   belonging to different American Tribes
affords a general mean of 46-23       oz.,  or 1310 grms.     With these may be
                                   “ Barbarous Tribes ” of Morton's American
compared the 164 skulls of the
Family. When the mean cubic contents of these are reduced to our terms,
with the observance of our rule, they produce a brain-weight of 42'84 oz., or
 1214 grms., which is less than our mean by something more than three ozs.
    When we arrive at the Caribs, former inhabitants of the Antilles, there
is a considerable falling off ; they descend to 42'32 oz., or 1199 grms.
    Among South American Tribes, the Amizcaa, or ancient inhabitants of
the plain of Bogota, a<U+FB01>'ord a mean brain-weight of 44'20 oz., or 1253 grms.
This is about the average until we reach the warlike Araucanians.             Of
these, six skulls, <U+FB01>ve of which are those of men, and one of them also a mega
locephalic skull, ascend to a mean brain-weight of 48-02 oz., or 1361 grms.
    The average of the whole of the American races reaches 44'73 oz., or
 1268 grms., which is 2‘14 oz., or 60 grms. less than that of the European
races.    It also comes so near to the general mean of the Asiatic and
African races as to produce the impression that the whole must be regarded
as pretty nearly equal.
    The AUSTRALIAN Races belong to two families—the Australians
proper, and the Tasmanians; and they are remarkable among human races
as possessing the smallest brains.         The mean brain-weight among the
former is 4138 oz., or 1173 grms., and among the more robust Tasmanians
42'25 oz., or 1197 grms.        The mean of the two families when combined
reaches to 41'81 oz., or 1185 grms.         This is a brain-weight one-ninth less
than that of the general average of Europeans.
    The last great section into which we have divided human races is that of
Ocnamc Races. It includes the aboriginal inhabitants of all the Islands,
both of the North and the South Paci<U+FB01>c Oceans.            “’hen we arrive at this
section we seem as if we were returning in some measure to the large
brain-weights of Europeans.

   The eight skulls of Malays (six of men and two of women) afford the
highest mean of any of the Oceanic Races, viz. 47'07 oz., or 1334 grms.
For such a bold and enterprising race, who have pushed their migrations,
chie<U+FB02>y for commercial purposes, over almost the whole Ocean, such a rich
cerebral endowment might have been in some measure expected.
   The collection which has afforded the materials for this Memoir is rich
in crania from the Dutch dominions in the East~lndian Archipelago.
These are distinguished for a tolerably high average of brain-weight. And
this is not much diminished when we reach the aboriginal inhabitants of
the Polynesian Islands and Western Paci<U+FB01>c.
   In   conclusion,it is believed that this investigation has contributed much
more   than  any former   one to de<U+FB01>ne and to discriminate the brain-weights
of different human races. Hence it is hoped that it will be accepted as a
valid contribution to a most important subject.
II.   “ Description of        a   Hand Spectrum-Telescope.”               By WILLIAM
             HUGorNs,     F.R.S.          Received December 19, 1867.
  The instrument described in this paper was contrived in the summer of
1866, for the purpose of observing the spectra of meteors and their trains.
The special suitability of this apparatus, as a hand-spectroscope, for the
examination    of the spectra of the lights which may be seen about the sun
during the total solar eclipse of next year, induces me to offer a descrip
tion of it to the Royal Society.
   The apparatus consists essentially of a direct-vision prism placed in
front of a small achromatic telescope.

   The achromatic      object-glass       marked     a   1'2 inch in diameter, and

two plane-convex lenses. As           a large <U+FB01>eld of view        of great importance,
                                                                 is
especially for  its  use  as      meteor-spectroscope,
                                  a                         the   <U+FB01>eld-lens    made of
                                                                               is
nearly the same diameter        as  the  object-glass.    The   imperfect de<U+FB01>nition at
the margin of the <U+FB01>eld     is   not of much practical importance, as the spectra
can be brought for examination into the centre of the <U+FB01>eld.                  The <U+FB01>eld
lens  is<U+FB01>xed in  a  sliding   tube,  which   permits   the  distance   between the two
lenses of the eyepiece     to  be  altered    in
                                               ;  this way  the   magnifying-power   of
the instrument may be varied within certain limits at pleasure.                    Be
fore the object-glass    is   <U+FB01>xed    a direct-vision prism (c), consisting of one
prism of dense <U+FB02>int glass, and tap prisms of crown glass.
   The <U+FB01>eld of view of my apparatus embraces an area of sky of about 7°
in diameter.     The spectrum of          abright star has an apparent length of
nearly 3°.   The spectrum of the Great Nebula in Orion appears as two

bright lines, one of them broad, crossed by a faint continuous spectrum.
The magnifying-power of the telescope is insuf<U+FB01>cient to show the three di
stinct lines of which the spectrum of the nebula consists.     The conti
nuous spectrum is due to the stars of the trapezium, and the other
fainter stars scattered over the nebula.
   For the purpose of testing the ef<U+FB01>ciency of this instrument                   as a meteor
spectroscope,   I   observed the spectra of <U+FB01>reworks seen from a distance of about
three miles.        The bright lines of the metals contained in the <U+FB01>reworks
were seen with great distinctness.                 I
                                     was able to recognize sodium, mag
nesium, strontium, copper, and some other metals.
   Unfortunately I was prevented from making the use                       of the instrument
which I had intended at the display of meteors in                           November     1866.
I have, however, great con<U+FB01>dence in the suitability of                      the apparatus for
the prismatic observation of meteors and their trains.
   As the instrument is not provided with a slit, it is                    applicable  only to
bright objects of small size, or to objects so distant                    as to subtend but a
very small angle.   It is obvious that if the object has a diameter smaller
in one direction than in any other, as would usually be the case with the
trains of“meteors, the instrument should be rotated to take advantage of
the form of the object. The most favourable position will be when the
smallest diameter of the object               is
                                   perpendicular  to the height of the
prisms.   In this way have seen the lines of Fraunhofer in the spectrum

                              is
   As some of the advantages which this instrument possesses over an or
dinary spectroscope, or over    prism held before the eye, may be stated
                                        a
the comparatively large amount of light which the object-glass collects,
the great facility for instantly pointing the instrument to the object de
sired, which the large <U+FB01>eld of view a<U+FB02>'ords, and in some cases the magni
fying-power of the instrument.
   It may perhaps be mentioned that secret signals might be conveyed
at night by means of the temporary introduction of certain suitable sub
stances, as preparations of lithium, copper, strontium, &c., into the <U+FB02>ame

   This little instrument, held in the hand and directed to the place of the
sun during its eclipse in 1868, might enable an observer, who was not
provided with larger apparatus, to give an answer to the important ques
tion whether the bright prominences are self-luminous or re<U+FB02>ect solar
light. At least      would be possible for him to determine the general
                         it
character of the spectrum of  bright prominence so far as to learn whether

it  is continuous    or consists of bright lines.     On account of the low mag
nifying-power of the instrument, the red prominence would appear suf<U+FB01>
ciently small to permit of bright lines being distinguished on its spectrum,
if such   should exist.
     The instrument      should  be   previously focused by the observer on the
moon, or some distant object.
     Should a portion of the sun’s limb be visible, the instrument must be
rotated until the spectrum of the little projecting prominence appears in a
 direction parallel to that of the spectrum of the sun’s limb, and is not
 overlapped by it.        Perhaps a diaphragm across the <U+FB01>eld of view and cut
 ting off about one-third of it would be an advantage, as the spectrum of
 the sun’s limb might be concealed behind it.             The eye, relieved in this
 way from the bright solar spectrum, would be in a more favourable state
 to examine the fainter spectrum of the red prominence.
     Four of these instruments, made by Mr. Browning, have been sent out
 by the Royal Society to India, to be placed in the hands of observers
 stationed at different places along the central line of the eclipse.      This in
 strument would be specially suitable for use at sea.
     Postscript—LIL Browning has recently suggested a method of diminish
 ing the apparent velocity of meteors by the use of a concave cylindrical
 lens placed with its axis perpendicular          to the direction of their motion.
 This mode of observing may be applied to the spectrum-telescope by sub
 stituting, when required, a plane-convex cylindrical lens for the eye-lens of
 the eyepiece.      If this lens be placed with its axis parallel to the height of
 the compound prism before the object-glass, and if the telescope be held
 in a position such that the direction in which the light of the meteor is
  dispersed   is perpendicular     to that   of its motion,    the spectrum of the
 meteor will be magni<U+FB01>ed,       as when the ordinary      eye-lens is employed, but
  the apparent velocity of the meteor will be less by an amount equal to the

     The unique specimen of Arc/zmopteryz Zitlwgraphica (von Meyer) which
  at present adorns the collection of fossils in the British Museum, is un
  doubtedly one of the most interesting relics of the extinct fauna of long
   past ages; and the correct interpretation of the fossil is of proportional
  importance.      Hence    I do not hesitate to trouble the Royal Society with

 2441'                Prof. Huxley         on Archaeopteryx lithographica.                   [J an.   30,
 the following remarks, which are, in part, intended to rectify certain errors
 which appear to me to be contained in the description of the fossil in the
 Philosophical Transactions                   for 1863 *.
     It   is obviously impossible to compare the bones of one animal satisfacto
rily     with those of another, unless it is clearly settled that such is the dorsal
and such the ventral aspect of a vertebra, and that such a bone of the limb
arches, or limbs, belongs to the left, and such another to the right side.
   Identical animals may seem to be quite different, if the bones of the
same limbs are compared     under the impression that they belong to oppo
site sides  and very different bones may appear to be similar, if those of op
                 ;
posite sides are placed in juxtaposition.
  The following citations, and the remarks with which accompany them,            I
however, will show that these indispensable conditions of comparison                              have
not been complied with in the memoir to which      refer.                I
     l. “ Themoiety (Plate                  I.)
                              containing the greater number of the petri<U+FB01>ed
bones exhibits such proportion of the skeleton from the inferior or ventral
aspect”          (I.
              c. p. 34).
 I   propose to show, on the contrary, that the fossilized animal presents,
in general, its dorsal aspect to the eye, though one of the most conspicuous
bones may have been so twisted round as to exhibit its ventral face.
   2. The demonstration that the bones of the AI‘CIHEOPié‘TyZ'    are thus
wrongly interpreted, may be best commenced by showing that what                                        is
called “ right femur (65), tibia (66), and bones ofthe foot (68,   iii, iv),”          i,   ii,
1. c. p. 35, are respectively the left femur, left tibia, and bones of the
left foot.
     That such           isvery easily proved by the circumstance that (as
                              the case   is
is very properly pointed out in the memoir) the second toe of the foot in
question    that which lies uppermost, while the plantar surface of the
                 is
foot   turned outwards, and its dorsal aspect towards the vertebral column.
         is
     If the      limb     in   question were, as the describer of the fossil supposes, the
right leg,   would obviously be impossible to place the foot in its present
                 it
position, unless the numbers of the phalanges in its toes were the reverse of
what     observed in Birds; that
          is                        to say, the uppermost toe, that which
                                                  is
has three phalanges, must also be the outermost.        Nevertheless the de
scriber of the fossil justly lays great stress upon the fact that the toes have
the same   number of phalanges as in birds.        As matter of fact, this   a                        is
quite true; but      would not be true
                              it          we were to assume with him that
                                                        if

spine to the so-called “right leg” are named, at p. 34 of the memoir
cited, “ Portion of the left as innominatum, showing part of the ilium (62)

     A full
          description of this mass of bone as
                                                “ the left os innominatum, in_
cluding the anterior two-thirds of the ilium, and the anterior half, or more,
of the coalesced ischium,” is given at p. 39; and at p. 40 <U+FB01>nd, “ The                               I
inferior or central * face [of the sacrum], as in the case qf the slightly die
localed left innominatum, is towards the observer.”
  There is no doubt on any side, that the end of the bone in question which
at present is directed forwards is its true anterior end, and that the edge
which is turned towards    the spinal column is the true dorsal edge.    The
question          is,
             whether the face of the bone which        exposed  its outer (or       is            is
dorsal) or its inner (or ventral) face.    In the former case  must needs be                  it
a right ilium, in the latter     left ilium. a
     That   the outer face of the bone which lies uppermost appears to me
             it   is
to be demonstrated—
  (a) By the fact that the iliac margin of the acetabulum         prominent,                        is
and that the adjacent surface of this ilium rises to this margin.     am not                             I
aware that any vertebrate animal exists in which the acetabulum lies at
the bottom of    funnel-shaped
                         a      depression, such as would be the casein
Archaeopterya:    the bone in dispute were the left 0s innominatum
                         if                                        seen
from the inner side.
  (6) By the fact that   small portion of what appears to be an innominate
                                        a
bone can be descried in close relation with the proximal end of what has
just       been       shown      to     be the left femur; while the right femur (called
left in the memoir),                  though dislocated,  not very far from the bone under
                                                                   is

   (c) By the further consideration, that    this were not the right os in
                                                                    if

     Nevertheless        I    venture to af<U+FB01>rm that 51'                   is   the right scapula and not the
left   ;   for   it   will not   be denied that the anterior or glenoidal                   end of the bone,
as   it           directed forwards, its posterior or vertebral end backwards,
           now lies,     is
and its glenoidal articular surface outwards and forwards        would be quite          :    it
impossible to put     left scapula of similar construction into this position.
                              a
   urther, the glenoidal end of this scapula remains in connexion with
     F
what    obviously the glenoidal (or humeral) end of the right coracoid
           is
(marked in Plate 1.).
                 c      The author of the memoir, indeed, gives different                                a
interpretationof the osseous projection thus marked (l. c. p. 37) :—
     “ Theprominence beyond the left scapula (Plate      51') suggested at               I.

   And this view is pictorially embodied in the restoration of the humerus
of Archmopterym given in Plate II. <U+FB01>g. 1.
   But a most distinct line of matrix separates the humerus from the promi
nence in question, in which may be seen, with great clearness, the glenoidal
facet of the coracoid, as well as the excavation of the exterior surface of the
bone which is characteristic of the glenoidal, or humeral, end of the cora
coid in birds and pterodactyles.
   I think, then, there can be no question that the parts marked 51' and
c in Plate I. of the memoir cited are the right scapula and the glenoidal
end of the right coracoid, and not, as the author a<U+FB02>irms, the left scapula
and a tuberosity of the humerus.
   5. Even apart from the fact that the humerus marked 53' lies in almost
undisturbed relation with the right pectoral arch, it is obviously a right
humerus.     On no other supposition can the relative position of the deltoid
ridge and of the various contours of the bone be accounted for.         Never
theless this is called “proximal half of left humerus (53'), entire, and part
of the distal half” at p. 34 of the memoir cited.
   It is probably needless to pursue this part of the inquiry any further. As
the so-called  right leg turns out to be the left, the so-called left os inno
minatum the right, and the so-called left scapula and wing-bones to be
those of the opposite side of the body, the necessity of a corresponding
recti<U+FB01>cation for the other limb-bones needs no evidence.
    6. As both the hind limbs and one-half of the pelvis have just such po
sitions as they would readily assume if the hinder part of the animal’s
body lay upon its ventral face, it is highly improbable (to say the least)
that the caudal and posterior trunk-vertebrae                 should have turned round so
as to present       their ventral aspect to the eye, as they do according                to the
memoir      c. p. 44).
             (l.
   But  Iapprehend that evidence can be found                     in

suf<U+FB01>cient to prove that their dorsal and not their ventral faces are turned
towards the eye.  In several of the best-preserved of these vertebrae, in fact,
(and Plate     imperfectly shows this,) the remains of two small articular
                   I.
pooccsses     are   distinctly visible at    each end    of the vertebra.
                                                               The superior
surface of each articular process          is    low longitudinal ridge; and
                                                raised into   a
the posterior pair of processes lie at the sides of    narrow, parallel-sided
                                                                       a
plate of bone, which  projects beyond    the posterior edge of the vertebra,
and   is   received between the anterior       articular processes of the vertebra which
succeeds it.            A   low linear   longitudinal elevation occupies the place of
spinous process.
   If my interpretation of these appearances     correct,      clear that the

subkingdom.
   When the specimen of Arc/zaopteryx is once put into its right position,
many points of its structure acquire an intelligibility which they lose to
those who accept the interpretations   given in the memoir.    The so-called
right foot, for example, which, as a right foot, is like nothing in nature,
becomes strikingly ornithic as a left foot, from the backward direction of
the hallux and the apparent anchylosis 0f the metatarsal bones. The distal
ends of the second and third metatarsals appear to me, however, to be sepa
rated for a much greater distance, proportionately to the length of the me
tatarsus,than in any existing birds, except the Penguins.
  The femur is more slender and more curved in proportion to its length
than in any recent bird with which I am acquainted.     The representation
of the bone in <U+FB01>g. 1 of Plate 111. is inaccurate, as may be seen by com
paring it with that given in Plate I.
  The small size of the cnemial crest of the tibia is also very remarkable.
     The right innominate           bone is imperfectly represented in Plate 1. of the
memoir cited.         Its   anterior end is not, as it there appears to be, abruptly trun
cated   there is an elevation in the region which would be occupied by the
        :
prominence against which the base of the great trochanter works, and which
is so characteristic of birds.   The greater part of the ischium is not re
presented; and the sacrosciatic space certainly has not the form which it
is represented to have.    The references 0 to the “ obturator foramen,” and
63, to the “ ischium
                                 ”          c. p. 40), are

       Alar, Astronomer Royal.            Received December 20, 1867.
                                      (Abstract.)
    The author,     after adverting to the origin of this branch of science, as
 commencing     (with himself) in communications with Messrs. Edwin and
 Latimer    Clark,   but more particularly with Mr. Charles V. \Valker, and
 alluding to the important labours of Mr. \V. H. Barlow, Mr. Walker, and
 Dr. Lamont, proceeds to give the of<U+FB01>cial history of the establishment of
 the wires and other apparatus necessary for its prosecution at the Royal
 Observatory.      In 1860 and 1861, the author submitted to the Board of
 Visitors of the Royal Observatory proposals for extending wires from the            -
 Royal Observatory in two directions nearly at right angles,—ou the second
 Occasion, specifying Croydon and Dartford as terminal points.           The Board
 in 1861 recommended this to the Admiralty, who immediately gave
 their sanction.     The author then applied to the Directors of the South
 Eastern Railway for permission to place his wires on their poles, which
 was granted, at a merely nominal rent.             All the wires and labour in
 mounting them were provided by the Railway Company at cost price, and
 the insulators were furnished by Messrs. Silver without pro<U+FB01>t.           The wires
 communicate with the earth at both ends of each by solder-attachment            to
 water-pipes.
    The author then describes the apparatus made by Mr. Simms for the
record of the currents.      For each wire the current acts on a galvanometer
whose needle~carrier also supports a small plane mirror; and, by proper
adjustment of cylindrical lenses, neat spots of light are formed upon a
rotating ebonite cylinder, covered with photographic paper and made to
revolve   (by clockwork) in twenty-four hours. With angular motion of
the   galvanometer,     the spot of light moves.       The zero of measure is
obtained by interrupting the wire-circuit.        The zero of time is obtained by
interrupting the light and observing the corresponding clock-time. Other
adjustments    have received great attention.
    Many delays occurred in the establishment of the apparatus, and <U+FB01>nally
from the discovery that the earth-currents were very much stronger than
    v0L. xvr.                                                        2 A

 250         Mr. Airy— Comparison of Magnetic Disturbances                   8yc.   [Feb. 6,
 had been anticipated.  From 1865,            April   18,    it   has been continuously   in
use, in the same form as at present.
   The author   then gives the theory, algebraical and numerical, for infer
ring, from the magnitude of the galvanic currents observed in two known
directions, the magnitude of the galvanic currents in the north and west
directions.      And, proceeding from these by the known law, that when a
current         the graphite or copper pole of a battery passes under a
             from
needle, it forces the austral element to the right (as referred to the current
course), he infers the magnitude of the magnetic force in the north and
west directions.
   The numerical expression contains four unequal constant factors, by
which the photographic      ordinates must be multiplied.      The author
explains that, for his own preliminary examination, he used four pro
portional compasses, constructed expressly for this purpose by Mr. Simms,
and thus formed the ordinates of the new Magnetic-Force Curves with
out any use of numbers whatever.       But for the more detailed work to
be done by young assistants, he judged it better to measure the ordinates
by scales with graduations of different value, and to add the results, thus
forming numerical values of the magnetic ordinates.
   The resulting scale being arbitrary, it was so adapted that the largest
ordinates were not very di<U+FB02>‘erent from the largest ordinates of the curves
given by the Horizontal-Force Magnetometer.       The curves given by the
Declination Magnetometer were adapted to the scale of the Horizontal
Force Magnetometer.
   In the large diagrams exhibited to the Society, the curves representing
the North Force as shown by the Horizontal-Force Magnetometer, and the
North Force as inferred from the Galvanometers, are brought into juxta
position, and the curves representing the West Force as shown by the De
clination Magnetometer,     and as inferred from the Galvanometers, are
brought into juxtaposition, for seventeen days in 1865, 1866, and 1867.
And the general agreement between the curves of the two classes, espe
cially for the North Force, is so remarkable that the author expresses his
undoubting belief that the irregularities of magnetic force are caused by
the galvanic     currents.   At   the same     time he indicates some discordances
which require further examination.            One of these        is,
                                                                that the disturbance
inferred from the galvanic currents usually (but not always) precedes that
recorded by the magnetometers.      Another            is,
                                                that the North Force ap:
pears, from the galvanic currents, to be increased (whereas,    magnetic       in
storms,
          it
          is usually found to be diminished).   There are other points of
smaller importance.
  The author suggests as possible that these discordances may arise from
the circumstance that the Observatory     at the end of each of the wires
                                                is                                        ;
and therefore the galvanic current which       recorded, being that which
                                                      is
covers   a   space whose centre   is   several miles from the Observatory, may not
correspond to the magnetic forces which            are observed at the Observatory.

 And     he submits for consideration whether it may not be desirable to try
 two shorter wires, the two ends of each wire making connexion with the
 earth on opposite sides of the Observatory, and the register of each being
 made, at the Observatory,              near the middle of its length.

     This paper is not adapted to be read in extenso; so much of it is con
nected with mere calculation, so much more of it requires continual re
ference to diagrams, that no adequate knowledge of its contents would be
acquired by merely hearing it read aloud; but a statement has been pre
pared of what it contains which will give a general view of the result.
     The properties ascribed to all odd numbers, in addition to those con
tained      in Fermat‘s theorem, are these :—1st. The algebraic sum of the
roots in some form of the 4 squares which compose the number will equal
1, 3, 5, 7, &c. (every odd number which it is large enough to produce);
2ndly, the difference between some 2 of the roots will be any odd or even
number whatever, subject to the same limitation.

     The' series    1, 3, 7, 13,     Ste. (11, n, n, n+l) will give 1, 3, 5, &c. as the sum
                       2   4   6    S
of the roots of its terms; and each term is the smallest that will give that
                    1   3    5    7

                      4 8      12   16
give the odd numbers as a difference of the roots, and                 1, 3, 9,  19, &c. that
                                                                         2  6  10
give the even numbers.                 And these are the three series that compose The
Square (the subject of the last paper) when the 1st term is l ; and they
are the cause of its properties.                A portion of the paper is devoted to an
investigation of the change effected in the sum of the squares, by a change
 in the roots.          If   2 roots differ by 11, they may be represented by a and
a+ri     ;   and if   the   smaller    be diminished by l, and the larger increased by
 l, the sum of the squares is increased by 2n+2 ; ifn=0, the di<U+FB01>'crence is
2; and it becomes             4, 6, 8, &c. as 11 becomes 1, 2, 3, 4, &c.        On the other
hand,      if the am aller root be increased and the larger diminished              by l, the
sum of the squares becomes less by 2n—2.
                                                                             2 A 2

252              Sir F. Pollock       on the Mysteries          of Numbers    [Feb 13,
    A  similar property belongs to all polygonal                numbers; in the trigonal
                     theinerease     is....         .. ..   ..     11+],
                     in the square it is      .....   . . . . .  2n+2    ,
                     in the pentagonal        ..........         3n+3,
                     and in the   m—gonal ..........             mn+m.
When the reverse operation takes place and the sum of the squares is
diminished, the + (plus) in the above expressions becomes — (minus).
There are some other modes mentioned also in dealing with the roots so as
to increase the sum of the squares by 2, although there be not two of the
roots which are equal.        A proof is offered, by means of a supplemental
square decreasing      as the other    increases, that if every number up to 2n +1
has the properties of odd numbers above enumerated, then the number
2n+3will     also possess them     ;   and  if this be so, then every subsequent odd
number      will likewise   possess     them.     This is a mode of proof not un
frequent in mathematicalLinvestigations            : it cannot be abbreviated ; but it
may be useful to state that the proof chie<U+FB02>y arises from this, that if one
term of a series corresponds with the law ofit, then every term will do so,
and in all the series but two there will be one term obedient to the law
which renders all the rest so ; the other two series are treated differently.
    It is shown that if a term, in the series 1, 3, 7, &c., whose terms (repre
sented in the roots of the 4 squares of which they are the sum) will be
a, n, n (221- 1)    be increased by 2, the roots being altered in the manner
described above, the operation may be carried on till one of the terms be
comes zero (0); but the next term in the series will be reached before that
occurs.     Then the next term may be taken as the beginning of another
similar operation, and may go on till another term is reached, and so on
without end. In this way the 4 squares into which any odd numbers may
be divided will be obtained; and if every odd number is divisible into 4
squares, every even number will be so likewise.
    The next subject is considered the most material and important in the
paper, because it connects Lagrange’s proof of the square numbers with
 The Square (the subject of the last paper). Euler thought that no assistance
 could be derived from the proof of Lagrange as to the other branches of
the theorem (see Euler, ‘ Opuscula Analytica,’ vol. ii. p. 4).               But if every
 odd number is composed of 4 squares or less, then a number of the form
 4n+2 must be composed of 2, 3, or 4 squares, and in any of these cases
 1: (any number) will be equal to 4 trigonal numbers, which is shown in the
paper.     The expression a’+a+b“ has been proved in a former paper of
the author to be a general expression for any 2 trigonal numbers; and if
any number is composed of 4 trigonal numbers or less, a’+a+h”+m“
 +m+n2 will represent any number whatever, odd or even, and 2a’+2u
 + 201+ 2m’+ 2m + 21:2 will represent any even number. This connects La
 grange’s proof of the squares with The Square, which is the subject of the
last paper; and if a series be composed of squares and double trigonal
 numbers beginning with nothing, and having differences 2, 2, 4, 4. 6, 6:

8, 8, &c., the series will be 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, &c., and any even number will
be made with some 4 terms of the series.      Now The Square, the subject of
the last paper, has a property not noticed in the former paper, viz. that the
<U+FB01>rst term of The Square, supposing it to be of the form 4n+3, will be in
creased in descending down the principal diagonal into—itliei sum of the
squares of the roots 11, 12+ 1, 11+ 1, n+1, into which the number itself may
be  divided; and if the form of the number he 4n+ l, a term which is the
sum of the roots n, n, n, n+1 (into which 4n+1 may be divided) would
appear in the diagonal next below the princip<U+FB01>’diagonal ; and as every odd
number is of the form of either 4n+3, or 4n+l, this applies to every
possible odd number, and each of these numbers is a term in the series
already mentioned, 1, 3, 7, 13, &c., and which may be increased by any
even number by means of the series 211’, 2a’+ 2a, and so on.      This, it is
shown in the paper, may be so altered as to correspond with the index of
some number in the principal diagonal of the square, or the one below                       it,

proved from the case of the squares, which (it             is   believed) has not been
done before; but this leads to other conclusions,       which are shown in the
paper.        If

of the resulting squares and   ;      shown that every odd number not only

 1+ 2a‘+2a+262+2m"’+2m, or l+2a"+ 2a+ 262+ 21:“; so that, with re
respect to every odd number, two of the squares that compose             may be      it
equal, and  also  two may  have their  roots differing by        I.
   There remains one other matter to be mentioned, viz.        certain remark
                                                                      a
able relation which all the polygonal numbers bear to each other, and
which forms      connexion that runs through them all, from which
                       a                                                  would       it

   This relation arises in the square numbers         property of the gradation

between that and the next term are found by the processes mentioned in
the former part of this paper. The roots of the even numbers are then
obtained by an analogous process ; and these are used as bases or roots of
the polygonal numbers, which are placed in columns, with their sums, as
appears in the Table (see Diagram No. 4 for the mode in, which the poly
gonal numbers are formed).
   It will be observed that the sum of the roots or bases is 17 but if they          ;
be used to form trigonal numbers, the increment of the sum of the re
sulting trigonal numbers above the sum of the roots or bases is 28, and so

   This corresponds with what was discovered by Cauchy, published at the
end of Legendre's ‘Théorie des Nombres,’ viz. that four only of each class

are su<U+FB02>iciently obedient, there  one class of even numbers quite refractory,
                                            is
viz. the powers of 2.   They may be easily expressed in squares, pentagonal
numbers, &c., but they cannot be brought within the rule that otherwise
prevails.

           Compounds Isomeric with the Sulphocyanic Ethers'.—I. On the

           Mustard Oil of the Ethyl Series.”
           F.R.S.
     The results of my researches on the chloroform-derivatives     of the
primary monamines, which, as      have shown, are isomeric with the nitriles,
                                           I
could not fail to direct my attention to allied groups of bodies, with the
view of discovering similar isomerisms.
      In   a.   note communicated           to the Royal Society  ago,     some months             I
expressed the expectations which even then appeared to be justi<U+FB01>ed in the
following manner :—“ In conclusion,    may be permitted to announce as
                                                  I

1868.]      Dr. Hofmann      on the Mustard      Oil of the Ethyl Series.       255
very probable the existence of a series of bodies isomeric with the sulpho
cyanides.     Already M. Clocz has shown that the action of chloride
of  cyanogen   0n ethylate    of potassium     gives rise to the formation     of an
ethylic cyanate possessing properties absolutely different from those be
longing to the cyanate discovered by M. Wurtz.                 On comparing, on the
other hand, the properties of the methylic       and    ethylic snlphocyanides with
those of the sulphocyanides of allyl and phenyl, it can scarcely be doubted
that we have here the representatives of two groups entirely different, and
that the terms of the methyl- and ethyl-series which correspond to oil of
mastard, and to the sulphocyanide of phenyl, still remain to be discovered.
Experiments with which I am now engaged will show whether these bodies
cannot be obtained by the action of the iodides of methyl and ethyl on sul
phocyanide of silver.”
   These experiments      I  have since concluded, but the hopes which             I
expressed have not been realized.         Dry sulphocyanide of silver is much
less easily attacked by the alcohol-iodides than the cyanide.              The mix
ture, in consequence of the formation of iodide of silver, rapidly turns yellow,
but the reaction is not completed without protracted digestion in the water
bath; on submitting the product of the reaction to distillation, thewell-known
sulphocyanic ethers, discovered by M. Cahours, are obtained.              The expe
riment was performed both in the ethyl— and the amyl-series; the ethers
thus produced, when compared with the compounds prepared by distilling
sulphocyanide of potassium with sulphethylates or sulphamylates, exhi
bited the same odour, the same boiling-point, and in general the same
chemical deportment.                                                                -
   The failure of these experiments could not, however, shake my belief in
the existence of two series of bodies of the composition of the sulphocyanic
ethers.    It was only necessary to <U+FB01>nd the method of producing the new
isomers.
   I was fortunate   enough almost at the very outset to trace the right track,
and  I beg leave to submit to the Royal Society some of the facts established
even now by my experiments.          These experiments are intimately connected
with some of my older observations.
   More than twenty years ago, when studying the action of bisulphide of
carbon on aniline, I discovereda <U+FB01>nely crystallized body, which in succession
has been designated as Sulphocarbanilide, Dijkenylsulphocarbamide, and
sulphuretted diphenylurea.        About ten years later", this compound again
passed through my hands.           I  then found that, when submitted to the
action of anhydrous phosphoric acid, sulphocarbanilide was converted by the
loss of 1 mol. of aniline into sulphocyanide of phenyl.             The phenyl-eom
pound has-the peculiarpungent odour of the ethereal oil of black mustard ;
like the latter it possesses the faculty of <U+FB01>xing the ammonias—so much so,
indeed, that I did not hesitate to describe the new compound as the mustard
oil of the phenyl series.

                             now that
series, and soon afterwards also in the naphthyl series, were not even then
extended to the ethylic compounds and their homologues—the more so since
the study of the action of bisulphide of carbon upon amylamine and ethyl
amine had, so to say, supplied me with the material for the inquiry. When
contemplated in the light of the recent observations, these experiments
                                              I
acquired an increased interest ; for could no longer doubt that the reaction,
which had yielded me the sulphocyanide of phenyl, when appropriately
applied to the derivatives of methylic, ethylic, and amylic alcohols, would
put me into possession of the compounds isomeric with the sulphocyanic
others which I was anxious to procure.   Experiment has not failed to

amylamine under the in<U+FB02>uence of the bisulphide“.      have resumed the          I
inquiry, which has furnished me the following results :—
   On adding bisulphide of carbon to an alcoholic solution of ethylamine,
the liquid becomes more or less heated, according to the concentration of
the solution.     The liquid turns neutral, and yields on evaporation an oily
compound,     which   after some time solidi<U+FB01>es into a mass of splendid tabular
crystals.   This compound fuses at 103°, and then retains the liquid con
dition even when cooled to the ordinary temperature. When gently heated,
the salt is volatilized, partly, at all events, without decomposition.   These
crystals are the ethylamine-salt            of   ethyl-sulphocarbamic               acid.

drous  phasphoric    acid, pungent vapours are evolved, which are con
densed to a yellowish liquid possessing in a remarkable manner the odour
of mustard oil.      When recti<U+FB01>ed,         liquid becomes colourless; it boils

ethyl which      is formed by the action of a metallic sulphocyanide upon
sulphethylate     of potassium.   The new substance is formed by the sepa
ration from      the diethylsulphocarbamide     of one molecule of ethylamine,

   In its properties, the new compound essentially differs from the known
sulphocyanic ethylether.    The boiling-point of the latter is 147°; the new
substance therefore boils 13° lower than the old one. The powerfully irri
tating   odourof the new ether is absolutely different from that of the
ordinary sulphocyanic ether, which, though by no means agreeable, exerts
no marked action either upon nose or eyes.
   By far the most characteristic feature of the new compound, however,
is the facility with which it acts upon ammonia and its derivatives. Dis
solved in alcoholic ammonia and digested for a few hours at 100°, the ether
is converted into ethylsulp/tocarbamide or sulphuretted ethyl-urea.

   All these diamines are very crystalline; they are weak bases which
dissolve in acids, and furnish, with perchloride of platinum, yellow crys
talline precipitates.
   The faculty of combining with the ammonias, it will be remembered, is
altogether de<U+FB01>cient in the ordinary sulphocyanic ethers.                  On the other
hand, it belongs to sulphocyanide          of allyl, or mustard oil. In fact the
new compound is in the ethyl-series what mustard oil is in the allyl-series.
I  have on this occasion again          perused the beautiful      memoir    of Profes
sor  Will   on mustard oil, the indications of which have served me as a
guide   in  my experiments.        So far as these experiments go, the parallelism

the principal properties of the new compound isomeric with sulphocyanide
of ethyl.
   In  a subsequent     paper    I propose   to communicate      to the Royal Society
the results of a comparative study to which          I  have submitted the old and
the new sulphocyanide,          together with the conclusions        elicited by these
researches as to the different atomic construction of the two substances.

   In conclusion, may be permitted to state that methylamine and amyl
amine, when subjected to the same treatment, have furnished me the
analogous mustard terms of the methyl- and amyl-group; the properties

of these substances have not yet more minutely investigated.

en dehors des électrodes d'une pile par un courant continu qui dure pen

je l'ai fait, outre que sur les nerfs de la grenouille, sur ceux des animaux

avec ces nerfs qu'on voit le courant appelé       de l'électrotone  acquérir une   *
plus grande intensité, se produire à une plus grande distance des points
 touchés par les électrodes de la pile, et avoir lieu encore d'une manière très
sensible lorsque le nerf a perdu tout-à-fait ses propriétés vitales. De même
sur ces gros nerfs on obtient facilement un phénomène très-important pour
la théorie, c'est-à-dire, la persistance du courant de l'électrotone après qu'on
a fait cesser le courant de la pile, pourvu que ce courant eût une certaine iu
tensité, et le passage eût été plus prolongé.

                                         (Abstract)
    These experiments were undertaken with a view to determine the resist
 ance of the air to some forms of heads of elongated shot which were likely
 to be of practical use.       The chronograph used was the one described in the
 Proceedings      of the Royal Artillery Institution for August 1866*, which
 was constructed on the plan of the Greenwich instrument.                       Ten screens
 were placed in a line at intervals of 150 feet, the <U+FB01>rst being 75 feet from
 the gun.       The following were the forms of the heads, and ten shot of each
 kind were prepared :—
           (l)     Hemispherical      .................. .....       .         solid.
           (2)     Hemispheroidal (axes as l : 2)          ............        solid.
           (3)     Ogival (struck with a radius =           1  diameter)   . . solid.
           (4)     Ogival (struck with a radius =          2 diameters) . .    solid.
           ( 5)    Ogival (1 diameter)       ....................              hollow.
           (6)     Ogival (2 diameters)       ....................             hollow.
     (3) and (5)     as well as  (4)  and   ( 6)   had respectively the same external
 forms, but the solid were nearly double the weight of the hollow shot. The
 gun used was a 40-pounder M.L., and the diameter of the shot was 4'7
 inches.
    It  was found, as in the trial experiments of 1865, that, if s be the space
 described in time t after passing the <U+FB01>rst screen, then, approximately,

   All  the hollow shot were <U+FB01>red, giving eighteen out of twenty successful
shots.    Only a part of the solid shot prepared were <U+FB01>red ; and they did not
give nearly such good results as the hollow shot, probably in consequence
of the superior angular velocity of the hollow shot—because, as a 5-lb.
charge was used throughout, the lighter shot had a higher initial velocity,
and consequently a higher corresponding angular velocity.
   Tables are given showing for every round :—(1) the experimental deter_
mination of the time of passing each screen, supposing the <U+FB01>rst screen to be
passed when i=0; (2) the velocities at the middle points between sue
cessive screens ; (3) the weights of the shot; and (4) the numerical values
of bl”, where   l:  150 feet, the distance between the screens.       And assuming
that,   for  a given   form of head, the resistance of the air varies as the
square of the diameter, the mean values of ‘26 have been adopted for shot
weighing W lbs., and having a diameter of :1 inches, or 2B feet.
   When abody is moving in a straight line under the action of a force
which varies as the cube of the velocity, it appears that the actual velocity
v' at the middle of any space 20’ is such that, if another body moved over
the same space 2s' with a uniform velocity.v', it would describe it in the
same time as the <U+FB01>rst-named body.             For the time t' would

   M. Hélie, in his ‘Traité de Balistique’          (1865), adopted, for elongated
projectiles, a law for the resistance of the air which varied as the velocity
cubed.     The law was deduced from some experiments made at Ga'irre, when
a great number of velocities (v', v") of shot <U+FB01>red with various charges were
measured at two points 2 metres apart.                The mean values of v' and u”
                                                          I
were taken and substituted in the formula                   ; and it was found that
this was approximately constant, and consequently that the resistance varied
as the (velocity)“.      The French measures and weights have been converted
into English measures for M. Hélic’s best experiment, in order to facilitate
comparisons with my own experiments.               The contents of M. Hélie’s work
were quite unknown to me for several months after my report on the above
experiments had been given in.           For an ogival-hended shot struck with a
radius of two diameters M. IIélic’s value of 211 is

 These equations all fail by              a'   becoming    in<U+FB01>nite when v=1015, 994, and
 979 respectively.
   It    is,
         however, observed that, in the assumption of the law of the resist
 ance, the higher the power of velocity the longer does the corresponding
 equation give rational results and by assuming R=avP with the same data,
                                          ;
 the following equation was obtained,

 which gives consistent results for all values of v.
    The value of    here

                                               7,
 nearly as the ninth power of the velocity.
    This result led the author of the paper to doubt the accuracy of the
 experiments, and to seek for further and more correct data, which were
 obtained from    minute (No. 23,351) of the Ordnance Select Committee,
                      a
 dated   2lst September 1867, containing the results of experiments show
 ing the   loss of velocity of two projectiles, one of 8'818 lbs., and the other
 of 251 lbs., in passing through certain given distances with given initial
 velocities, varying from about 1500 feet to 600 feet per second.
   From these results        a   diagram was constructed, and for each projectile an
 equation      was found     which agreed tolerably    well with the experimental
 results.
   The form of the equation assumed was
                                           (.r-f-a) v”=C      ;

   It  next shown that the hypothesis of the great increase of resistance
        is
at velocities exceeding1100 feet per second being due to the vacuum
behind the projectile untenable, because the actual resistance at 1300 feet
                                      is
-per second           is only 9'94 lbs. per square inch, whilst, according to that
hypothesis,           the back resistance alone would be 15 lbs. per square inch.
   It   suggested that the true reason of the great increase of resistance
         is
may be found in the fact that    wave-impulse cannot be propagated at
                                                      a                                                              a
greater velocity than 1100 feet per second, and that consequently     great                              a
condensation of air must take place         front of the projectile at all velo

cities exceeding this, and the resisting force of such condensed air will in
crease       greater rate than indicated by Mariotte’s law, owing
             at   a                                                                                         to the
evolution of heat due to the condensation.

sh'ot weighing 8'8 lbs., moving with     mean velocity of 986 feet per second,

   The time of <U+FB02>ight being '96 of       second, the resisting force must have

   Now, according                 to the formula             given in this paper,           the resistance           is
found        to be         17 '75 lbs.,         whilst Hutton’s formula             gives    a   resistance of

   This paper relates to the Theory of Local Probability—that      the appli        is,
cation of Probability to geometrical magnitude.       This inquiry seems to
have been originated             by
                           the great naturalist Bu<U+FB02>'on, in   celebrated pro     a
blem propoed and solved by him.      Though the subject has been more
than once touched upon by Laplace, yet the remarkable depth and beauty
of this new Calculus seem to have been little suspected till within the last

1868.]          Probability,         applied to Random Straight Lines.                                 267
few years, when the attention of several English mathematicians has been
directed to   and results of
                it,           most singular character have been obtained.
                                        a
    The problems          on Local Probability which have been hitherto treated
relate almost         exclusively to points taken at random. The object of the
present paper    to show how the Theory of Probability
                      is                                to be applied to         is
straight lines whose position    unknown, or, in other words, which are
                                              is
taken at random.
   The author commences by showing that when      straight line  drawn at
                                                                       a                      is
random in an inde<U+FB01>nite plane, or, in other words, when we take one out of
an in<U+FB01>nite assemblage of lines all drawn at random in the plane, the true
mathematical   conception of this assemblage   as follows        is              :—
    Conceive the plane ruled with an in<U+FB01>nity of parallels                            at   a   constant in
<U+FB01>nitesimal   distance (8p) asunder; then imagine this system of parallels
turned through an in<U+FB01>nitesimal angle (50)          then through
                                                             ;      second equal      a
angle, and  so  on, till the parallels  return  to  their original direction;  the
plane will thus be covered    with   an in<U+FB01>nite  number   of systems of parallels,
running in every possible direction.
  If an in<U+FB01>nite plane be covered in this manner with straight lines, and we
draw any closed convex contour on the plane, and then imagine all the lines
effaced from the plane, except those which meet this contour, we shall have
a  clear conception of the system of random lines which meet the given
contour.
   By applying mathematical calculation to this system, the following im
portant principle  proved :—
                           is
    The measure        of   the number        of random lines          which    meet a given       closed
convex   contour       is   L,   the length    of the contour.
    If the    contour be non-convex, or be not closed, the measure will be the
length Qf an endless string passing round   and tightly enveloping it.
                                                            it
   Hence, given any closed convex contour of length      and any other of       L,
length   lying wholly within the former, the probability that
         l,                                                     line drawn                a
at random to meet           L    shall also meet

   The following propositions             are then established             :—
   If the contour lie wholly
                       l                 outside     L,                X

plane, and then <U+FB01>xing our attention on the intersections of the former
system with the latter, we <U+FB01>nd the density here proportional to 0                ;   and the

   Given any convex boundary (whose apparent magnitude is called 6), let
there be an external boundary surrounding it, such that any tangent to
the inner cuts         of

the integral extending over the whole annulus between them, D being the
diference of the areas of the parts into which the annulus is divided by
any tangent to the inner.
   For instance, we may take two similar concentric ellipses. If both the
inner and outer boundaries are of any convex forms whatever, the above
expression is still true, provided D mean the average value of the dg'<U+FB01>‘erence
of areas as the tangent revolves by uniform angular displacements.
   If we consider a plane covered with random lines, and then divide them
into two systems, one crossing a given boundary, the other all outside                    it,
the density of the points in which the former system cut the latter will be
proportional to sin 6; and this leads to the next theorem.

  l. “ On  Governors.”     By J. CLERK MAXWELL, M.A., F.R.SS.L.           8: E.
                           Received Feb. 20, 1868.
     A Governor is a part of a machine by means of which the velocity of the
  machine is kept nearly uniform, notwithstanding variations in the driving
  power or the resistance.

 1868.]                 Mr. J. C. Maxwell      on Governors.                        271
    1\Iost   governors depend on the centrifugal force of a piece connected
with a shaft of the machine.         When the velocity increases, this force in
creases, and either increases the pressure of the piece against a surface or
 moves the piece, and so acts on a break or a valve.
    In one class of regulators of machinery, which we may call moderators *,
the resistance is increased by a quantity depending on the velocity.             Thus
in some pieces of clockwork the moderator consists of a conical pendulum
revolving within a circular case.       When the velocity increases, the ball of
 the pendulum presses against the inside of the case, and the friction checks
the increase of velocity.
    In Watt’s governor for steam-engines the arms open outwards, and so
contract the aperture of the steam-valve.
    In a water-break invented by Professor       J. Thomson, when the velocity
is increased, water is centrifugally pumped up, and over<U+FB02>ows with a great
velocity, and the work is spent in lifting and communicating            this velocity
to the water.
    In all these contrivances  an increase of driving-power produces an increase
of velocity, though a     much smaller increase than would be produced with
out the moderator.
    But if the part acted on by centrifugal force, instead of acting directly
on the machine, sets in motion a contrivance which continually increases
the resistance as long as the velocity is above its normal value, and reverses
its action when the velocity is below that value, the governor will bring
the velocity     to the same     normal   value whatever    variation    (within the
working limits of the machine)         be made in the driving-power or the re
sistance.
    I propose at present, without entering into any details of mechanism, to
direct the attention of engineers and mathematicians to the dynamical
theory of such governors.
   It will be seen that the motion      of a machine    with its governor consists
in general of a uniform motion, combined with a disturbance which may
be expressed as the sum of several component motions. These components
may be of four different kinds :—
    l. The disturbance may continually increase.
   2.   It may continually diminish.
    3. It may be an oscillation of continually increasing amplitude.
    4. It may be an oscillation of continually decreasing amplitude.
   The <U+FB01>rst and third       cases are evidently  inconsistent with the stability     of
the motion ; and the second and fourth alone are admissible in a good go
 vernor.     This condition is mathematically equivalent to the condition that
all the possible roots, and all the possible parts of the impossible roots, of
a certain    equation shall be negative.
   I  have not been able completely to determine these conditions for equa

tions of a higher degree than the third; but       I hope that the subject   will
obtain the attention of mathematicians.
    The actual motions corresponding to these impossible roots are not ge
nerally taken notice of by the inventors of such machines, who naturally
con<U+FB01>ne their attention to the way in which it is designed to act ; and this
is generally expressed by the real root of the equation. If, by altering the
adjustments of the machine, its governing power is continually increased,
there is generally a limit at which the disturbance, instead of subsiding
more rapidly, becomes an oscillating and jerking motion, increasing in vio
lence till it reaches the limit of action of the governor.     This takes place
 when the possible part of one of the impossible roots becomes positive.
 The mathematical investigation of the motion may be rendered practically
useful by pointing out the remedy for these disturbances.
    This has been actually done in the case of a governor constructed by Mr.
 Fleeming Jenkin, with adjustments, by which the regulating power of the
 governor could be altered.      By altering these adjustments the regulation
 could be made more and more rapid, till at last a dancing motion of the
 governor, accompanied with a jerking motion of the main shaft, showed
 that an alteration had taken place among the impossible roots of the
 equation.
    I  shall consider three kinds of governors,     corresponding  to the three
 kinds of moderators already referred to.
    In the <U+FB01>rst kind, the centrifugal piece has a constant distance from the
 axis of motion, but its pressure on a surface on which it rubs varies when
 the velocity varies.    In the moderator this friction is itself the retarding
 force.    In the governor this surface is made moveable about the axis, and
 the friction tends to move it ; and this motion is made to act on a break
 to retard the machine.      A  constant force acts on the moveable wheel in
 the opposite direction to that of the friction, which takes off the break
 when the friction is less than a given quantity.
    Mr. Jenkin’s governor is on this principle. It has the advantage that
 the centrifugal piece does not change its position, and that its pressure is
 always the same function of the velocity.     It has the disadvantage that the
 normal velocity depends in some degree on the coef<U+FB01>cient of sliding friction
 between two surfaces which cannot be kept always in the same condition.
    In the second kind of governor, the centrifugal piece is free to move fur
 ther from the axis, but is restrained by a force the intensity of which varies
 with the position of the centrifugal piece in such a way that, if the velocity
 of rotation has the normal value, the centrifugal piece will be in equilibrium
 in every position.    If the velocity is greater or less than the normal velo
 city, the centrifugal piece will <U+FB01>y out or fall in without any limit except
 the limits of motion of the piece.      But a break is arranged so that it is
 made more or less powerful according to the distance of the centrifugal
 piece from the axis, and thus the oscillations of the centrifugal piece are
 restrained within narrow limits.

 1868.]                 Mr.   J. C. Maxwell on Governors.                        273
     Governors    have been constructed     on this principle by Sir W. Thomson
and by     M. Foucault.     In  the <U+FB01>rst, the force restraining the centrifugal piece
is that of a spring acting between a point of the centrifugal piece and a
<U+FB01>xed point at a considerable distance, and the break is a friction-break
worked by the reaction of the spring on the <U+FB01>xed point.
     In M. Foucault’s    arrangement, the force acting on the centrifugal piece
is the weight of the balls acting downward, and an upward force produced
by weights acting on a combination of levers and tending to raise the balls.
The resultant vertical force on the balls is proportional to their depth be
low the centre of motion, which ensures a constant normal velocity.
The break is :—in the <U+FB01>rst place, the variable friction between the com
bination of levers and the ring on the shaft on which the force is made
 to act; and, in the second place, a centrifugal air-fan through which
more or less air is allowed to pass, according to the position of the
levers.     Both these causes tend to regulate the velocity according to the
 same law.
     The governors designed by the Astronomer Royal on Mr. Siemens’s prin
ciple for the chronograph          and equatorial of Greenwich Observatory de
pend on nearly similar conditions.           The centrifugal piece is here a long
 conical pendulum, not far removed from the vertical, and it is prevented
 from deviating much from a fixed angle by the driving—force being rendered
nearly constant by means of a differential system.            The break of the pen
 dulum consists of a fan which dips into a liquid more or less, according to
the angle of the pendulum with the vertical.            The break of the principal
 shaft is worked by the differential apparatus ; and the smoothness of motion
 of the principal shaft is ensured by connecting it with a <U+FB02>y—wheel.
     In  the third kind of governor aliquid is pumped up and thrown out over
 the sides of arevolving cup. In the governor on this principle, described by
 Mr. C. W.      Siemens, the cup is connected with its axis by a screw and a
 spring, in such     a way that if the axis gets ahead of the cup the cup is
 lowered and more liquid is pumped up.             If this adjustment can be made
 perfect, the normal velocity of the cup will remain the same through a
 considerable range of driving-power.
     It appears from the investigations        that the oscillations in the motion
  must be checked      by some force resisting    the motion of oscillation.     This
 may be done in some cases        by connecting the oscillating body with a body
 hanging in a viscous liquid, so that the oscillations        cause the body to rise
  and fall in the liquid.
     To check the variations of motion in a revolving shaft, a vessel <U+FB01>lled with
 viscous liquid may be attached to the shaft.          It will have no effect on uni
  form rotation, but will check periodic alterations of speed.
      Similar effects are produced by the viscosity of the lubricating matter
  in the sliding parts of the machine, and by other unavoidable resistances ;
  so  that it is not always necessary to introduce special contrivances to check
  oscillations.

  These equations apply to a tube of given section throughout.       If the
<U+FB02>uid is in open channels, the values of A'and C will depend on the depth to
which the channels are <U+FB01>lled at each point, and that of I: will depend on
the depth at the over<U+FB02>ow.
   In the governor described   by Mr. C. W. Siemens in the paper already
referred to, the discharge is practically limited by the depth of the <U+FB02>uid
at the brim of the cup.
  The resultant force at the brim is      Mg°+u‘r".     f:
  If the brim is perfectly horizontal, the over<U+FB02>ow will be proportional to
xi (where z is the depth at the brim), and the mean square of the velocity
relative to the brim will be proportional                      to x, or to Q§.
  If the  breadth of over<U+FB02>ow at the surface is proportional to x", where .z' is
the height above the lowest point of over<U+FB02>ow, then Q will vary as w’H'a, and
the mean square of the velocity of over<U+FB02>ow relative to the cup as .r or as

which shows that the velocity of rotation and of over<U+FB02>ow cannot be con
stant unless the velocity of rotation is w.
     The condition about the over<U+FB02>ow is probably difficult to obtain accurately
in practice; but very good results have been obtained within a con
 siderable range of driving-power by a proper adjustment of the spring.                              If
the rim is uniform, there will be a maximum velocity for a certain driving
power.      This seems to be veri<U+FB01>ed by the results given at p. 667 of Mr.
 Siemens’s paper.
     If the <U+FB02>ow of the <U+FB02>uid were limited by a hole, there would be a minimum
velocity instead of a maximum.
    The differential equation which determines the nature of small disturbances
is in general of the fourth order, but may be reduced to the third by a
proper choice of the value of the mean over<U+FB02>ow.

 a wheel or system     of wheels which are capable of rotation round an axis,
 which is itself also capable of rotation about the axis of the main shaft.
These two axes may be at right angles, as in the ordinary system of di<U+FB02>'er
 ential bevel wheels; or they may be parallel, as in several contrivances
 adapted to clockwork.
     Let E and 11 represent the angular position about each of these axes re

       ence     to the undertaking of certain Physical Observations in
       India.” Communicated to the Society by direction of the Pre
       sident.
   On the 13th of February 1866,           J. S. N. Hennessey, Esq., First Assistant
on the Trigonometrical Survey of India, addressed a letter to the President,
in which, after explaining the nature of the calls upon his time occasioned
by his professional duties, he o<U+FB01>'ered to devote any portion of his leisure
to such scienti<U+FB01>c      experiments as the President might direct.             He stated
that he was resident at Mussoorie from May to              October,   residing at Dehra
during the remainder of the year, from which place, however, he would be
able to visit Mussoorie        occasionally,  such as once a week.        Mussoorie   is a
hill-station or town, at an altitude above the sea-level of about 6700 feet,
in lat. 30° 28' N., and long. 78° 10' E. With reference to the climate of
this place he observes, “ In September the skies begin to clear, and
from     September      15   to about   December     15 there prevails at Mussoorie
a clearness of atmosphere such as           I have never known in my wanderings.
I  mention this period in particular        ; but at all times, when the sky is clear
of   clouds, the intensity      of the heavenly bodies is something exquisite.           I
have seen      Venus distinctly at midday with my unaided eye.                 It is this
wonderful      transparency of atmosphere to which I would draw particular
 attention.”
    This letter was read to the Council on the 28th of June, and was ordered
 to be printed, and the President was requested to communicate it to such
 men of science as he might see <U+FB01>t, with the view of obtaining suggestions
 with reference thereto.
    The President accordingly communicated the letter to several scienti<U+FB01>c
 men, accompanied by a request that they would favour him with suggestions
 as to observations         which it might seem to them desirable that Mr.
 Hennessey should he requested to take up.              Answers were received during
 the recess; and on the 1 1th of October a Committee was appointed to draw
 up a report upon Mr. Hennessey’s letter, giving speci<U+FB01>c indications as to
 the observations in meteorology and with the spectroscope which it might
 be desirable to make.
    Before     the Committee       presented   their report another subject of great
 scienti<U+FB01>c interest presented itself in connexion with India.            On the 17th of

 August in the present year will occur a total solar eclipse of nearly the
 greatest possible duration.     This eclipse will be visible in India, but else
 where only in parts of the earth which are comparatively uncivilized or
 dif<U+FB01>cult of access. ' The subject was accordingly taken into consideration
 by the Committee; and both objects are embraced in their report, which is
 here appended.
   “Report of    the Committee on       Mr. Hennessey’s Letter concerning
                    Astronomical Observations in India.
    “In making a selection of subjects to which they suggest that Mr.
 Hennessey’s attention might advantageously be directed, the Committee
have borne in mind that that gentleman's professional duties necessarily
occupy the greater part of his time and attention.           They have therefore
abstained from recommending researches which, though desirable in them
selves, would require for their successful prosecution          that the observer
should devote his main attention to them, or which, though less laborious,
are of such a nature as to admit of being equally well carried on elsewhere.
    "§ 1. The determination of the order of brightness of the <U+FB01>xed stars
by the method of sequences, as described by Sir John Herschel in his Cape
Observations, is one for which the extraordinary clearness of atmosphere
described by Mr. Hennessey o<U+FB02>'ers peculiar advantages, and which, losing
absolutely nothing in value by being taken up in a disconnected manner, is
eminently suitable for leisure hours.        It requires the use of a good star
map,    but no apparatus.    The  peculiar clearness  of atmosphere at Mussoorie
does not, it is    true,  extend over a very large part of the year; but by
making observations sometimes in the early part of the night, sometimes
towards morning, a large part, of the heavens might be brought under
scrutiny without including stars too near the horizon to give trustworthy
results—more     especially as favourable nights might occasionally occur at
other times of the year.      The time at which the comparison of two stars
was made should always be noted, in order to render it possible subse
quently to make a correction for zenith-distance.
    “ When numerous observations taken on different          occasions have been
compared, should any particular star be found to exhibit unusual discre
pancies, giving rise to the suspicion that it might be a periodic star, uch
star would naturally claim special attention, and should be frequently
observed in comparison with a few selected stars near it in brightness, with
a view to test its periodicity—and in case of con<U+FB01>rmation to determine the
period, and maximum and minimum brightness.
    “ 2. It would be well if Mr. Hennessey would also watch the zodiacal
      §
light, after sunset about the months of April and May, and before sunrise
at the opposite time of year, with a view to de<U+FB01>ning its form and extent,
and also noticing anything which may be held to indicate whether it be
lenticular or annular.

at that place especially interesting.  On account of the fragility of the

compared before departure with the Kew standard, and their coe<U+FB01>‘icients
of reduction to the Kew scale determined.
   “§ 4. Much attention has recently been bestowed on the atmospheric
lines of the solar spectrum; and      appears to be pretty well established
                                           it
that they are, partly at least, due to absorption by watery vapour.       The
extreme clearness of atmosphere at Mussoorie would seem to render this
a desirable subject of investigation at that place, provided    clear view of
                                                                           a

     “ For thispurpose the observer should be provided with      spectroscope

extreme red to the line E.     The spectrum should <U+FB01>rst be observed when

represented in the map not be found, and should the want not be due to
inferior spectroscopic power, (which may be judged of by comparing
neighbouring lines of similar strength with their representation in the map,)
such missing lines should be noted as lines probably atmospheric included
in the map: Then the spectrum should be observed at low altitudes of
the sun, and the lines seen in addition to those in the map measured and
drawn.       Differential    measures referring the additional lines to those repre

discharges which might occur should be mentioned.
    “ In this  way we should gradually obtain from independent observation
a map of the purely terrestrial lines.    In the construction of the map much
must be left to the discretion of the observer, as the appearance changes
rapidly with the varying altitude of the sun. \Vhen constructed, the map
ought to be repeatedly compared with the object, with a view to determine
whether the system of atmospheric lines be single, or consist of two or
more systems superposed.       Should two gases possessing the power of de
<U+FB01>nite absorption be present, as it is not likely that they would occur in the
same proportion on different occasions, and under different conditions of
weather, the complex character of the atmospheric system, if it be complex,
would thus probably be in time revealed.        The map should also be com
pared with the map drawn by Sir David Brewster and Dr. Gladstone,
from observations made in England and Scotland (Philosophical Transac
tions for 1860).
    “ 5. In connexion with the offer made by Mr. Henuessey, the Com
      §
mittee have had under their consideration the subject of the total solar
eclipse of next year, which will be visible in India.        As it will be long
before equal facilities for observing the phenomena of the totality recur, it
seems desirable not to lose this opportunity of making some physical ob
servations on the phenomenon, which at the present time are of great in
terest.    Above all, the character of the spectrum of the red protuberances
may    be expected to throw great light on their nature; and it is therefore
important to be prepared with an instrument for observing their spectrum,
and that of the corona.     It is also important that fresh observations should
be made on the polarization     of the light of these objects.
    “In   order that a suf<U+FB01>cient   apparent  breadth  may be given to the red
protuberances to permit of the convenient observation of any lines by
which their spectrum may be crossed, it is necessary to use a tolerably
high magnifying-power; and in order that this may be done with the
least possible loss of light, a corresponding      aperture is required in the
 telescope to be employed.     Messrs. Cooke-and Sons have on hand a <U+FB01>ne
 telescope of 5 inches aperture, mounted as a portable equatorial, furnished
with clock movement, which may be obtained for a moderate sum; and
 the Committee    recommend that this instrument be purchased, with such
 part  of the  mounting as is required for the observations contemplated, and
 be provided with a star-spectroscope.       They understand that Lieutenant
 Herschel, who is now in this country, and is going out to India in the
course of a few months, would be willing to undertake the, observations,
 subject to the approval of Colonel Walker, the Director of the Great Tri
 gonometrical Survey of India.        But as clouds might interfere with the
 observations by the large instrument at the critical moment, the Committee
 think it desirable that three or four direct spectroscopes, by which the
 general character of the spectrum might be observed, should be entrusted

    to Colonel Walker         to be placed  in the hands of observers at di<U+FB02>'erent
    stations.
        “ The    observation of the polarization would also require the use of a
    telescope, which, however, may be of much smaller size, such as 2 inches
   aperture, and will therefore be comparatively inexpensive.
        “The Committee estimate that the whole cost of the instruments            they
   have recommended, for the use both of         Mr.  Hennessey and of those gentle
   men who may undertake the observations of the eclipse, will be under £300.”
       This Report was presented to the Council on the 20th of June, 1867.
   The Council adopted the report and requested the Committee to take the
   requisite steps for carrying out their recommendations.            They further re
   solved that application be made to the Government—grant Committee for
   a sum of not exceeding £300 to defray the expenses, and that the Trea
   surer be authorized       to make such advances within that sum as might in the
  meantime be required to enable the Committee to proceed with the work.
       Mr. Huggins kindly undertook to superintend the construction of the
  instruments,       and to give instruction in the use of the star-spectroscope to
  the observer who might be selected to observe the spectrum of the red pro
  tuberances      ;  and it is mainly owing to  Mr. Huggins’s   zeal in the cause that
  the instruments       have all been got ready within the limited time allowed.
       The following instructions were drawn up for the guidance of the ob
  servers who might be entrusted with the observations which it was intended
  to make on the occasion of the total solar eclipse :—

           the occasion of the Total Solar Eclipse of 1868, by means of
           Instruments sent out by the Royal Society.
           “        Special Objects         Observations proposed to be made.
             § 1.                    of the
       “
         According to modern opinion, the photosphere of the sun consists of a
  shell of liquid or solid particles, constantly forming by condensation in the
 outer layers of the intensely heated gaseous matter of the sun.                When
 nearly the whole of the light from the solar photosphere is screened off by
 the moon during a total solar eclipse, two other, feebler sources of light
 without the sun’s photosphere usually show themselves.               One of these is
 in the form of an irregularly bright halo surrounding the sun, and is known
as the Corona.          The other source of light usually presents itself as small
tongue-shaped <U+FB02>ames more or less coloured, which apparently issue forth
from the solar photosphere.
      "The special object of the observations suggested is to determine, as
                                                              ‘
far     as   may be possible, the physical nature of the         Corona’ and of the
‘Rerl<U+FB02>ames.’
      “To     obtain this information it is proposed to analyze the light from
these sources for polarization,        and especially to observe its prismatic spec
trum in both cases.
                                                                      2 D 2

    “If these    objects are visible by re<U+FB02>ecting to us the light of the photo
sphere, their spectra would       be identical, or nearly so, with the normal solar

luminous, a supposition which appears not improbable in the case of the
red flames, some information as to their constitution may be expected to
be given to us by the prism.
      “   II.  Description of Instruments sent out by the Royal Society.
        §
     “The   telescope provided for the spectrum-observations          has an object
glass of <U+FB01>ve inches aperture.           The telescope is mounted on aportnble
equatorial stand, with circles for declination and R. A., divided on silver.
 The stand can      be adjusted to any latitude  ; and the whole instrument packs
into three boxes for convenience in travelling.
     “The telescope has a very perfect driving-clock, the rate of which is
maintained uniform by means of a form of pendulum governor recently in
 vented by    Mr.    Cooke, by whom the whole instrument has been specially
 constructed for these observations.          A Barlow lens is <U+FB01>tted to the tele
 scope for the purpose of increasing the size of the image formed by the
 object-glass.      The <U+FB01>nder is wired in a special manner, and has a diagonal
 eyepiece   for  convenience   in looking from it to the small telescope of the
 spectrum-apparatus       attached to the equatorial telescope.
     “The    spectroscope, constructed by Messrs. Simms, has one prism              of
 dense <U+FB02>int glass, with a re<U+FB02>ecting angle of 60°.           The instrument is fur
 nished with a micrometer-screw for measuring the position in the spectrum
 of any lines observed.          There is also provided a photographed scale
 illuminated by      a small lamp, which can be seen by re<U+FB02>ection from the
 second surface of the prism.        The positions of lines in the spectra observed
 can be read by means of the re<U+FB02>ected image of the divisions of this scale.
     “The slit of       the instrument is so constructed       that both jaws open
 equally.      A cylindrical lens is provided       for  the observation of stellar
 spectra.     The instrument is furnished with a prism‘and mirror, by means
 of which the spectra of terrestrial <U+FB02>ames can be compared directly with
 the spectra of the objects to which the telescope is directed.
     “ Four portable hand spectrum-telescopes are provided, by means of
 which it will be possible to determine the general character of the spectra
 of the lights seen about the sun at the time of the eclipse.
     " For the purpose of
                                 analyzing the light of the ‘corona’ and ‘red
  <U+FB01>ames’ for polarization, 9. second telescope has been procured, of three
 inches aperture.        This instrument has altitude and azimuth motions on a
 portable tripod stand. It is furnished with three eyepieces, magnifying 27,
 41, and 98 diameters.          By a suitable arrangement of adapters, either of
 the following analyzers can instantly be used either in connexion with eye
 piece 27 diameters or eyepiece 41 diameters.
     “The <U+FB01>rst analyzer consists of a double-image            prism, and a plate of
  quartz cut perpendicularly      to the axis.     When polarized light is present

in  the object viewed, both images become strongly coloured with comple
mentary tints.
    “ The   second analyzer is formed of a Nicol’s prism and a system of quartz
cut obliquely, known as Savart’s polariscope.
    “ It is almost certain that the light from the
                                                          objects will be polarized
in a plane passing through the radius of the sun, if at all; and arrange
ments may be made accordingly.             Nevertheless, if time permits, a rough
 determination of the plane of polarization, in case the light should prove
to be more or less polarized, would be desirable.         The plane may be deter
 mined roughly by the <U+FB01>rst annlyzer by noticing the azimuth of the analyzer
 when either image (specifying which) assumes the ‘tint of passage’ (a purple
in which blue and red are equally balanced),-—more accurately by the
second, by observing the azimuth at which the bands disappear, and stating
whether on turning in a given direction from this position the bands seen
are black-centred or white-centred,          or, which is better, when the po
larization    is but slight, by observing the azimuth at which the bands are
most vivid, and stating the character (black or white) of the central band.
    “    III.   Instructions
      §                        as to the general method of (be observations to
                                        be made.
    “i. In    order that the    observer may acquire the necessary familiarity
with the    use   of the spectroscope, it is recommended that he apply himself
as far as his other engagements may permit, during the time after his arrival
in India until the period of the eclipse, to a prismatic examination of the
brightest of the Southern Nebulae.
    “The    instruments    sent out by the Royal Society are in every respect
suitable and convenient for these observations.          The determination of the
character of the spectra of the more brilliant of the Southern Nebulae would
be a service for science of very great value.
    “ It is recommended that the observer
                                                 provide himself with a list of, say,
from <U+FB01>fty to a hundred of the brightest of the Nebulae the distance of
which from the north pole prevents an advantageous study of them in the
latitude of England.         From this list the observer would select each night
the Nebulae which, at the time of observation, were situated near the meri
dian.     The equatorial mounting, with its <U+FB01>nely divided circles, would make
the <U+FB01>nding of the. Nebula: a task of no dif<U+FB01>culty.
    “ The observer should <U+FB01>rst make a
                                             diagram and general description of
the nebula as it appears in the telescope.         The object should next be ex
amined with the spectroscope added to the telescope.           The telescope should
then be moved so as to bring in succession upon the slit the di<U+FB01>'erent parts
of the nebula. The wire arranged for that purpose in the <U+FB01>nder would
enable the observer to determine with accuracy the part of the nebula
under examination.
    “At   the commencement of the observation the slit should be widely
 open,   and   the observer should then make it as narrow as the light of the

290       On Physical Observations       to be undertaken    in India.     [Man 5,
object would permit.         In this way the character of the spectrum. of each
portion of the nebula could be recorded in connexion with the description
of its appearancc which had been already made.             If the spectrum should
be discontinuous,      the positions of the bright lines should be measured by
the micrometer-screw, or by the re<U+FB02>ected scale.           It is recommended that
 the screw should be used in preference       to the scale whenever      it is found
 practicable    to do so.
    “ For   the purpose of obtaining the value of the micrometer-screw and
 of the scale, measures should be frequently taken of the principal lines of
 Fraunhofer.       These measures should     be taken as near the time when the
 observations     are to be made as possible.      As a precaution against any
accidental displacement of any part of the instrument, at the time of ob
serving the nebulae, a reading should be taken of the sodium line (D of
Fraunhofer) by means of a small alcohol lamp placed before the object
glass of the telescope.
    “A series of observations of the principal Southern Nebulae would be
of very great value in the present state of our knowledge, and would cer
tainly repay the entire cost of the instrument, should bad weather, or some
unforeseen accident render the primary object, the investigation of the sun,
impossible.
    “The observer should also practise himself with observing the spectrum
of the moon, and of a cloud brightly illuminated by the moon, in order to
become familiar with the appearance of spectra which are continuous,
except so far as they may be interrupted by dark lines, and which come
from objects rather de<U+FB01>cient in illumination.
    “i  . Instructions for the spectrum-observations      of the eclipse.
    “The     equatorial telescope should be previously put up accurately in
position,   within   a suitable temporary hut or observatory.       The clockwork
is to be adjusted to sun’s apparent motion. The Barlow lens is to be
employed, and placed within the focus at a distance suf<U+FB01>cient to double,
or nearly so, the diameter of the sun’s image.
    " Great care must be taken that the <U+FB01>nder is in perfect adjustment, so
that the spectrum of any object brought upon the point of the indicating
wire may with certainty be visible when the eye is placed to the little
telescope of the spectrum-apparatus.
    “It   will be well for the observer to decide previously whether he intends
to make use of the micrometer‘screw,        or of the illuminated scale. Still he
is requested to have the small lamp lighted, and both methods of measuring
in proper order, so that either could be available instantly during the
duration    of the totality.                                                       _
    “During     the progress of the eclipse, both before and after the. totality,
the observer is to take measures of the lines of Fraunhofer, with the micro
meter, and also with the scale.
    “The measures obtained of the eclipse, and which have been made in
the interval between the two sets of observations of the solar lines, can

 1868.]      On Physical Observations      to be undertaken    in India.        291
 thus  be referred to them, and the positions      on the spectrum of the lines
accurately determined relatively to the lines of Fraunhofer.
    “ The <U+FB01>nder is provided with a diagonal eyepiece, over which a
                                                                             wedge
of dark glass is made to slide.
    “ The   observer is expected to watch the progress of the eclipse in the
<U+FB01>nder, moving the wedge of glass as the light of the sun diminishes.
    “As soon as he perceives a ‘red prominence,’ by means of the very
e<U+FB02>icient   arrangements    provided in the instrument, he is to bring the red
prominence upon      the  point of the indicating wire.    The observer will then
see the spectrum of the ‘red <U+FB02>ame’ in the little telescope of the spec_
troscope.
    “ At the commencement of the observations the lowest eyepiece should
be used, and the slit should not be too narrow.
    “ The observer is <U+FB01>rst to record the
                                             general character of the spectrum,
whether continuous      or discontinuous.
    “ Then the
                 principal lines, whether dark or bright, are to be measured
with as much care as the very limited time will permit.
    “ As the spectrum of the red prominence is compound, and contains the
spectrum of the light of the portion of corona before it (possibly also to
some extent of the corona behind it), suf<U+FB01>cient time must be left to move
the instrument so as to bring upon the slit a part of the corona where it is
brightest.
    “ The character of the spectrum must be in a similar manner examined,
and any lines present measured.
   “ Of course, if there should be found        time to do so, it would be de
sirable that several red prominences       should   be examined, and also light
from different parts of the corona.         The observer, however, is strongly
recommended      to make as     complete an analysis as possible of the ‘red
<U+FB02>ame’ <U+FB01>rst selected.
   “ The observer is requested to send in full all the details of the ob
servations as they were taken down at the time.
   “ A Clerk will be required to write down the results at the moment from
the dictation of the observer.
    “iii. The use of the portable hand spectrum-telescopes will be obvious.
The observer has only to direct the instrument to the sun at the moment
of totality. The instrument should be previously focused to suit the ob
server, upon the moon or some distant object.           The light of the corona
and red <U+FB02>ames will be dispersed into its component colours.              It will be
easily detected whether the spectra of the corona and of the red <U+FB02>ames are
continuous, or consist of bright lines.       The four instruments should be
placed in the hands of observers stationcd         at different  places along,   or
nearly along, the central line of the eclipse.
   “ iv. Observations for polarized light in the corona and ‘rcd <U+FB02>ames.’
   “ A distinct observer is required for these observations.        He should    be
familiar with the telescope and its motions.

292       On Physical Observations        to be undertaken  in India.      [Man 5,
    “ A  small observing-hut,      or temporary place of shelter, would     be  pro
bably necessary.
    “ It is recommended        that the eyepiece magnifying twenty-seven         dia
meters be used.
    “ The   observer    should    <U+FB01>x upon the eye-end of the telescope a disk of
 cardboard    some   12 or 15 inches diameter,    which, near the edge, may be
 roughly   divided   by  a  few  large <U+FB01>gures, which   can be easily read in the
 feeble light which prevails during the totality.       To the small tubes carry
 ing the analyzing prisms a long index of card should be attached.                 In
 this way the plane of polarization may be read off notwithstanding the
 feebleness of the light.
    “ With a dark glass the observer is to watch the progress of the
                                                                             eclipse
until the whole of the sun is obscured.          The dark glass is then to be re
moved, and the corona and red <U+FB02>ames observed for traces of polarized light.
    “ There are two analyzers provided.
    “ The observer is to use <U+FB01>rst the double-image prism and plate of
                                                                             quartz.
A slight degree of polarization will show itself by a difference of colour in
the two images.
    “ An   attempt    should   then be   made to determine                       the
                                                               approximately
plane in which the light is polarized.
    “ If polarization is detected in the ‘corona,’ or in
                                                              any prominence of
large extent, the second analyzer may probably be employed with advan
tage. This consists of a Nicol’s prism and a compound plate of quartz,
showing Savart’s bands.         By means of these bands, the plane of polariza
tion of the light analyzed may be easily obtained.”
    The observation of the spectra of the corona and red protuberances
being one of considerable delicacy, it was highly desirable that the ob
server should have some previous training in this country, while, on the
other hand, to send such an observer on purpose would involve consider
able expcnse-      It fortunately happened that Lieut. J. Herschel was at the
time in this country, and was about to return to India in November 1867,
to resume his duties in connexion with the great Trigonometrical Survey
of that country.       Mr. Herschel took a lively interest in the subject, and at
once, on being applied to, undertook the observations which were to be
made with the large telescope furnished with the spectroscope, subject to
the approval of Colonel \Valkcr, Director of the Survey.            This approval
was readily    given, as will appear from the following letter   :—

 inform you of the safe arrival of the instruments entrusted to             me by the
 Royal Society.
    “
       My  present   occupations  absolutely    forbid   my endeavouring to enter
 into details; and it is only from a strong feeling that at least so much
 should be said that     I sit down to write at all, at a time when scarcely a
 moment is my own.
    “ I                                  familiar with the equatorial and spec

 opportunity, and, I may add, energy, have been available, have been devoted
 to preliminary examination and manipulation rather than actual employ

     Rocks of the Gold-Regions of California—The great sedimentary me
tallic belt of California lies on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, be~
ginning in the neighbourhood of the Tejou Pass, and extending through
the state to its northern limit.      In consequence, however, of various local
circumstances, different portions of this band are of very unequal impor
tance as gold-producing districts.
    The slates of the auriferous belt have been shown by Professor Whitney
to belong, for a great extent, to the Jurassic period, although the occur
rence of numerous Triassic fossils       in the gold-bearing rocks of Plumas
County and elsewhere renders it more than probable that no inconsider
able portion of the slates in the heart of the gold region are of that age.
    The rock constituting the principal mass of the Sierra Nevada is a
granite containing only a small proportion of quartz, and in which but one
species of felspar (oligoclase) is generally found.
    Lying between the band of metamorphic slates and the great central
mass of granite forming the more elevated portions of the chain, are
found various crystalline rocks, such as syenites, diorites, and porphyries.
     Quart: Veins.——The matrix or gangue of the auriferons veins of Cali
fornia is invariably quartz, which is generally crystalline in its structure,
or partially vitreous and semitransparent.          In  the majority of cases the
quartz constituting    an auriferous veinstone      is ribboned in such a way as
to form a succession of layers parallel with the walls of the lode itself; and
some one or more of these laminae are not unfrequently far more produc
tive than all the others.     In some instances these parallel bands are sepa
rated from each other by a thin layer of quartz, slightly differing, either in
colour or structure, from that forming the seams themselves ; or they may
be only distinguished    by a difference of colour of two adjoining        members
                                                       ‘

      In many cases, however, laminae of the enclosing slates divide the vein
  into distinct bands ; and in such instances it will be observed that the thick
   ness of the interposed fragments of slate is sometimes not greater than
   that of a sheet of the thinnest paper.          Cavities or druses containing
  crystals of quartz occur in all the auriferous veins of the country ; and a
  certain amount of crystallization       may also not unfrequently be remarked
   along the lines of junction of the several bands of which a vein is composed.
   In addition to ordinary quartz, in a more or less crystalline form, amor
   phous hydrated silica, or semiopal, and chalcedony are occasionally met
   with: in some instances the opal is interfoliated between layers of true
   quartz, and is suf<U+FB01>ciently   auriferous to repay the expenses of treatment.
      The metallic minerals     enclosed in the gangue of auriferous veins are
  ordinary iron pyrites,     blende, and galena, and, less frequently, arsenical
  pyrites,   magnetic   and copper pyrites,     and cinnabar.     These  sulphides
  invariably contain gold; and veins in which some one or more of them
  does not occur, in considerable amounts, are not regularly and lastineg
  productive.                                                            -
      Near the surface the iron pyrites and other sulphides become decom
  posed by the action of air and the percolation of meteoric water through
  the mass, staining the quartz of a red or brown colour, and leaving the
 gold in a free state.     Under such circumstances numerous cubical moulds
 of iron pyrites are found in the veinstone; and although this mineral has
 been entirely removed by chemical action, the cavities left contain <U+FB01>nely
 divided gold, obviously liberated by the decomposition of pyrites.
     Beneath the line of natural drainage of the country the sulphides remain
 undecomposcd;      but if rock containing pyrites be placed in nitric acid the
 sulphide    becomes   dissolved, and <U+FB01>nely divided, crystalline, or <U+FB01>liform
 gold will partially occupy the resulting cavities.
     In one of the detrital beds in the vicinity of the village of Volcano in
 the County of Amador, and elsewhere, distinctly marked quartz veins
 may be observed cutting through the gravel, and evidently formed          by the
 action of water holding silica in solution.
     Attention has also   been recently directed to bands of auriferous slate
 found    in the copper-bearing belt west of the main gold-belt of the State,
 and in the foot hills of the Sierra.       In this locality the gold, instead of
being obtained from        a  well-de<U+FB01>ned vein, chie<U+FB02>y compased of ordinary
quartz, is enclosed in a band of siliceous slaty rock, extending north-west
and south-east, and dipping in conformity with the other strata of the
district.
     The number of <U+FB02>uid-cavities contained in the veinstones of the aurifcrous
lodes of California is seen under the microscope to be exceedingly limited ;
and in order to obtain sections affording good examples, even of small size,
it is necessary to select such hands as may be more than ordinarily crys
talline, or to operate on thin fragments of crystals sometimes found
lining the interior of drusy cavities.       In the more opaque and generally

296                   Mr. J. A. Phillips  on the Chemical            [Man 12,
most auriferons portions of veins, the cavities are numerous but exceedingly
small, and are often so opaque, apparently rendered so by being internally
coated with a lining of clay, that no vacuities can be distinguished.
    Out of more than <U+FB01>fty sections of veinstone examined, only some six
or  seven were found to contain <U+FB02>uid-cavities of suf<U+FB01>cient size to admit of
any attempt at accurate measurement by means of ordinary appliances;
hut in all cases there appeared to be considerable differences in the rela
tive dimensions of the vacuities and the enclosing cavities, and the tem
peratures at which they severally became <U+FB01>lled were consequently ascer
tained by direct experiment.      In every instance they were found to require
very different degrees of   heat  to become full, since in the same specimens
some of the vacuities disappeared at 180° Fahr., others <U+FB01>lled at tempera
tures slightly above that of boiling water, whilst many, though       much  re—
duced in size, remained perfectly visible at 365° Fahr.
    Alluvial  Deposits.»—Althongh    a very large amount of the gold annually
obtained was no doubt originally derived from auriferous veins, not more
than about one-third     of the precious metal collected is procured directly
from that source.      The larger proportion of the gold now brought into
the market is derived from alluvial diggings, in which it is separated by
washing from the clay, sand, and gravel with which it is associated.
    This gold-bearing drift belongs to at least two distinct geological epochs,
both comparatively modern—although the latter period is distinctly sepa
rated from the earlier, its materials being chie<U+FB02>y derived from the disinte
gration and redistribution of the older deposits.
                  the more ancient deposits or “ deep placers
                                                                ”
    In California                                                 are referable
to a river-system different from that which now exists, <U+FB02>owing at a higher
level, and frequently nearly at right angles to the direction of the main
valleys of the present period.
    The deep placers are in many localities    covered by a thick capping of
lava; and the eruptive matter covering them often occurs in the form of
basaltic columns, beneath which are found the layers of sand, gravel, and
boulders with which the gold is associated.         The wood which occurs in
these gravel-beds is either beautifully silici<U+FB01>ed, or is replaced by iron
pyrites.
    In the more clayey strata of these deposits leaf-beds and impressions of
leaves are not nnfrequcntly found ; and an examination of these made by
 Dr. Newberry authorizes the conclusion that the auriferous deposits lying
 beneath the lava are of tertiary age, and that they probably belong to the
 later Pliocene epoch.    Vl'ater-worn gold is disseminated throughout the
 whole mass of these deposits, not, however, with uniformity, but always in
greater abundance near the bottom, and more particularly in direct contact
 with the “ bed rock,” which is invariably grooved and worn by the action
 of water.
    The materials of which these deep placcrs are composed are frequently
 consolidated into a sort of hard concrete, by being <U+FB01>rmly bound together

by crystalline iron pyrites; and sometimes this cementing material consists
either of carbonate of lime or silica.        The silica is rarely met with in a
crystalline form ; but near Kenebeck Hill a cavity, resulting from the junc
tion of several pebbles, was found completely lined with well-de<U+FB01>ned crystals
of quartz.     These did not show, under the microscope, the usual <U+FB02>uid
cavities  of  quartz of the ordinary quartz veins of the country.
    Where the cementing material of the conglomerate chie<U+FB02>y consists of
pyrites, the enclosed trunks of trees are usually replaced by that mineral,
although, of two pieces of wood lying in close proximity to each other,
one may have become silici<U+FB01>ed, whilst the other is replaced by iron
pyrites.
    Theassay of several specimens of the cementing pyrites showed that it
invariably contained a certain but very variable amount of gold.                In
order to ascertain whether this exists in the form of water-worn grains
mechanically enclosed within the sulphide, or in the form of spongy, crys
talline, and <U+FB01>lamentary particles, similar to those met with in the pyrites
of auriferous veins, various samples were dissolved in nitric acid, and
the residues    afterwards  subjected to microscopical examination.        In this
way granules of the precious metal, which had evidently been worn by the
action of water, were detected, whilst others appeared not to have been
 subjected to such attrition.      Mr. Ulrich states that in the gold-drifts of
Australia pyrites is often found replacing roots and driftwood, and that
 samples have, on assay, yielded from a few pennyweights         to several ounces
of gold per ton.
    Hot Springs.—Hot         and  boiling springs are exceedingly numerous
throughout California;      and   considerable accumulations      of sulphur, to
gether with evidences of    extensive solfatara action, are met with in different
 sections of the State.
    The most remarkable     instance on the Paci<U+FB01>c coast of the actual growth,
on a large scale, and at the present time, of mineral veins is probably that
afforded by the boiling springs in Steamboat Valley, about seven miles
 north-west of the great Comstock silver vein in the State of Nevada.
    These springs are situated at a height of about 5000 feet above the
level of the sea, at the foot of the eastern declivity of the Sierra Nevada.
The rock in this locality presents several straight and parallel <U+FB01>ssures,
 either giving out heated water or simply ejecting steam.          The <U+FB01>rst group
of crevices comprises <U+FB01>ve longitudinal springs extending in a straight line,
 and parallel to each other, for a distance of above 3000 feet. These
<U+FB01>ssures are partially <U+FB01>lled by a siliceous incrustation, which is being con—
 stantly deposited on the sides, whilst a longitudinal central crevice allows
 of the escape of boiling water or steam. On the most eastern of these
lines of fracture are <U+FB01>ve active centres of eruption, from which boiling
 water is sometimes ejected by the force of steam to a height of from S to
 10 feet.    These waters are alkaline,    and contain, in addition   to carbonate
 of soda, the sulphate      of that  base,   together  with chloride   of sodium.

 298            Chemical Geology of the Gold-<U+FB01>elds       of California.        [Mar. 12,
 There is also everywhere       an escape of carbonic acid, whilst from some
 places sulphuretted      hydrogen is also evolved. These products, on arriving
 at the surface, give rise to the deposition of sulphur, silica, and anhydrous
 oxide of iron.   The silica and oxide of iron form semicrystalline bands
 parallel with the walls of the <U+FB01>ssures ; and spongy deposits accumulate
 around some of the points of most active emergence.
    At a considerable distance to the west of those above described, a <U+FB01>ssure
 having the same origin is observed ; but this is no longer traversed by
 currents of hot water, although it still gives off steam and carbonic acid
at various points throughout its extent. At its northern extremity a central
<U+FB01>ssure still remains open ; but in other localities it     is,

   Alkaline Lakes.—In that portion of California lying on the east of the
Sierra Nevada are Mono Lake and Owen’s Lake, both considerable sheets
of water, highly impregnated with alkaline salts.    Owen’s Lake lies     lat.       in
36°20” south, long. 118° west from Greenwich, and       about twenty miles
                                                                 is
in length and eight in width.
   The waters of this lake have     speci<U+FB01>c gravity of 1076, and contain
                                        a

the paper, chie<U+FB02>y composed of carbonate of soda, mixed with               a   little chlo
ride of sodium and sulphate of soda.
     General deductions.—The author remarks          that, in the present state of
our knowledge, the results of      a   careful examination of the gold-regions of
the Paci<U+FB01>c coast would appear to lead to the following conclusions :—
   a. Quartz veins have generally been produced                    by
                                                         the slow deposi
tion from aqueous solutions of silica on the surfaces of the enclosing
<U+FB01>ssures.
      From the general parallelism with its walls of the planes of any frag
     6.
ments of the enclosing rock which may have become imbedded in          vein,     a
it   to be inferred that they were mechanically removed by the growth of
     is
the several layers to which they adhered, and that    subsequent deposition
                                                          a
of quartz took place between them and the rock from which they had
become detached.   In this way were introduced the masses of rock known
as   “    horses."
     c. The formation     of quartz veins   is   due to hydrothermal agencies, of

1868.]                  Mr. W. Shanks      on Euler’s  Constant.                299
which evidences are still to be found in the hot springs and recent metal—
liferous veins met with in various parts of the Paci<U+FB01>c coast.
    d. From the variable temperatures at which the vacuities in their <U+FB02>uid
cavities become <U+FB01>lled, it may be inferred that they are the result of an in
termittent     action, and that the <U+FB01>ssures were sometimes traversed by cur—
rents of hot water,         whilst at others they gave off aqueous vapour 0r
gaseous exhalations.         This is precisely what is now taking place at Steam
boat springs, where the formation of a vein is in progress, and from which
currents of boiling water are often poured forth, whilst at other times the
<U+FB01>ssures give o<U+FB01>' currents of steam and heated gases only.
    e.  That gold may be deposited from the same solutions which give rise
to the formation       of the enclosing quartz, appears evident from the presence
of that metal in pyrites enclosed in siliceous incrustations, as well as from
the fact of large quantities of gold having been found in the interior of the
stems of trees, which in deep diggings are often converted into pyrites.
   f. The constant presence of iron pyrites in auriferous veins, and when
 so occurring its invariably containing a certain amount of gold, suggests the
probability of this sulphide being in some way necessarily connected with
the solvent by which the precious metal was held in olution.             It has been
 shown that <U+FB01>nely divided gold is soluble in the sesquichloride of iron and,
 more sparingly, in the sesquisulphate of that metal.         It is also well known
 that iron pyrites sometimes results from the action of reducing agents on
 the sulphates of that metal.         If therefore sulphate of iron, in a solution
 containing gold, should become transformed by the action of a reducing
 agent    into   pyrites, the gold, at the same time being reduced       to the me
 tallic state, would probably be found enclosed in the resulting crystals of
 that mineral.
    g. The silica and other substances forming the cementing material of
 the ancient auriferous river—beds have probably been slowly deposited at a
 low temperature.
    The connexion existing between the decomposition of granite by the
 agency of boiling springs, the existence of alkaline plains, and the for
 mationo     f  lakes containing    various salts of soda and potash, is too ob
 vious to require comment.

    Comparing the values of E obtained from taking n=500, 1000, 2000

               interest but a few years ago, is now produced on an industrial
        scienti<U+FB01>c
    scale.   It is more especially a beautifully crystallized yellow colouring
     .matter.(Manchestery ellow), the dinitronaphtkylic acid, discovered and
        .<U+FB01>rst employed  as a dye by Dr. Martins, which is largely manufactured
        from naphthylamine.     The base occurring in commerce is far from being
        pure.   It is generally met with as a brown fused mass, containing more
    , or less resinous matter and, more particularly, a considerable amount of
    ,naphthaline. The puri<U+FB01>cation of the commercial product presents some
    , dif<U+FB01>culties;  still tolerable crystals may be obtained by crystallization
    ,-from petroleum.
         For the object             I had      in view        it
                                             was unnecessary to purify the naphthyl
    ..amine of commerce.                    The
                                           was mixed with powdered oxalic acid in
                                                     base
        such proportions as to produce the primary oxalate with an excess of free
    ,   oxalic acid. Four parts of naphthylamine and <U+FB01>ve parts of crystallized oxalic
        acid were found to yield very satisfactory results.     The operation had to
        be performed upon rather a large scale.      After some trials, a cyanide-of
        potassium pot, provided with a cover and bent tube, proved to be the most
        convenient apparatus for distilling the mixture.     At the commencement of
        the operation water and naphthalinewere evolved; soon, however, an oily
        liquid appeared, solidifying on cooling, and consisting of a mixture of naph
        thylformamide, naphtkylos'amide, oxalate of naphthylamz'ne, naphthylamine,
        and naphthaline.   This distillate was transferred to one of the large two
        necked stone-ware bottles which are used for condensing nitric acid, mixed
        with concentrated hydrochloric acid, and submitted to the action of a power
        ful current of steam, care being taken to condense the steam by a spiral sur
        rounded with water.    Together with the water large quantities of a dark
         brown, almost opaque oi], heavier than water, were thus obtained.    For
        this oil, which a more minute examination proved to be the compound                                               I

302       Prof.  A. W. Hofmann       on the Transformation      of the    [Man 19,
   The puri<U+FB01>cation    of the crude product      presented no dif<U+FB01>culty.      The oil
was separated from the water by         ether, and,  after the ether had   been  eva
porated, submitted to distillation.         Between 218° and 220° the thermo
meter became stationary ; the fraction distilling at that temperature solidi
<U+FB01>ed on cooling, and exhibited the boiling-point, fusing-point, and the other
properties of naphthaline.      The thermometer then rose rapidly to 290°, and
the whole liquid had distilled before the thermometer reached 300°.              The
liquid distilling between 290° and 300° was of a light-yellow colour, and
of  a peculiar aromatic    odour;    after  standing for twenty-four hours in a
cold    room, it likewise solidi<U+FB01>ed    to a crystalline mass.      On immersion in
l frigori<U+FB01>c mixture,    solidi<U+FB01>cation immediately took place; once solidi<U+FB01>ed,
the compound no longer lique<U+FB01>ed at the ordinary temperature.                The new
compound thus obtained is easily soluble in           alcohol;   the crystals which
on evaporation separate from this solution are absolutely pure.            On adding
water to the alcoholic solution the body separates as an oil, which after a
few moments solidi<U+FB01>es to a confused mass of crystals.           These crystals fuse
at 33°-5; fused and resolidi<U+FB01>ed,        the substance is heavier than water;       its
boiling-point is 296°‘5 (corr.).
    The new compound represents in the naphthyl-series           the benzonitrile   in
the benzoic series.     Its  composition, as has already been pointed out in the
equation exhibiting its formation, is represented by the formula
                                      O..H.N
    On dissolving the nitrile in an alcoholic solution of soda, comparatively
little ammonia is disengaged ; but addition of water to the solution shows
at once that the nitrile has undergone transformation.           The crystals which
are precipitated are far less fusible and soluble than the nitrile.        By one or
two recrystallizations    from boiling alcohol they are obtained in a state of
perfect purity.     Thus prepared they are <U+FB01>ne white needles, fusing at 244°
(corn), and subliming at a high temperature.             Analysis has proved these
 crystals to have the composition
                       CHILNO =            C1, H.,N + H30,
 thus showing that they are the amide corresponding to the nitrile, from
                                                                                    '
 which they are derived by the accession of 1 molecule of water.
     I have mentioned that the transformation of the nitrile into the amide is
 attended by an evolution of ammonia.             This evolution is obviously due
 to the further change of the amide.             Assimilating a second molecule
 of water, this substance gives rise to the formation of an ammonium
 salt,

 which in its turn is converted into the sodium compound with evolution of
 ammonia.       Indeed, on adding hydrochloric acid to the alkaline solution, an
 abundant precipitate of a beautifully crystalline acid is obtained, the pro
 perties of which strongly resemble those of benzoic acid.             It is scarcely

necessary to state that the di<U+FB02>‘icultly soluble amide, when submitted to the
protracted action of boiling soda, is ultimately entirely converted into the
new acid.
    Of the three substances mentioned, the acid is by far the most interest
ing, forming as it does the starting-point of a new group of compounds, the
number and variety of which can scarcely be inferior to that of benzoic
acid.     It thus became desirable to prepare the acid on a larger scale. For
this purpose it was not necessary to employ the nitrile or the amide in a
state of perfect purity. The crude nitrile had simply to be boiled for some
time with alcoholic soda, care being taken to condense the vapours, so as not
to lose any nitrile by evaporation.     When ammonia was no longer evolved the
alcohol was boiled 05', and the alkaline liquid <U+FB01>ltered after cooling, whereby
small quantities of naphthylamine were separated.         The brown liquid, when
decomposed by hydrochloric acid, furnished an abundant curdy precipitate,
consisting of the new acid.        It was washed with cold water and recrystal
lized partly from boiling water (in which it is very sparingly soluble), partly
from hot alcohol (by which it is copiously dissolved).          Thus puri<U+FB01>ed, the
new acid presents itself in the form of white needles, which fuse at 160° C.
Fused and resolidi<U+FB01>ed, the new compound is heavier than water.                When
heated beyond its fusing-point the new acid sublimes.            The boiling-point
is considerably above 300°.        The acid is nearly inodorous and tasteless;
when heated it feebly evolves the odour of naphthaline; its vapour, like
that of benzoic acid, irritates the respiratory organs.       The solutions of this
acid have a distinct action upon litmus-paper, and decompose with facility
(more especially on heating) the alkaline carbonates.
    In accordance with a principle of nomenclature             which I proposed
some time ago,      I will designate the new acid by the name menaphthozylic
 or naphthaline-carboxylic acid.        In this case the amide receives the name
menaphthozjr/lam-ide, the nitrile that of menaplzt/renylnitrile.
    I may be permitted brie<U+FB02>y to mention some of the observations which,
in studying the new compound, I have already been able to collect.
    It has been stated that the nitrile <U+FB01>xes water with facility. It could not
 be doubtful that in like manner it would also combine with sulphuretted
hydrogen.        Indeed, when dissolved in alcoholic sulphide of ammonium,
 and exposed for some hours to a temperature of 100°, the nitrile absorbs
 one molecule of hydrosulphuric acid, being converted into a beautifully
 crystalline body, easily soluble in alcohol, which fuses at 126°, and has the
 composition
                         CanNS        = C,,H.,N + H18.
    This substance is menaphtkoaulphylamide,           corresponding to thiobcn
 zamide,     the sulphuretted    derivative of benzonitrile    discovered by M.
 Cah ours.
    I have examined menaphthoxylic acid somewhat in detail. Like benzoic
 acid, to which it has a strongly marked family resemblance, it is a mono
 basic acid.      The silver-salt is   a white,   scarcely crystalline   precipitate,

described in the preceding paper.  By distilling  sulphonaphthylate  with  a

                                        ( Abstract.)
    The object of the Paper is to show that the proportion of length to
 breadth     in a ship, and the form of her water-lines, should be made in a
very great degree dependent upon the weight of the material of which her
hull is to be constructed— that an armour-plated ship, for example, should
 be made of very different proportions and form from those of a ship with
 out armour, and that as the extent and thickness of the armour to be
carried by a ship are increased the proportions of length to breadth should
be diminished,       and the water-lines increased in fulness.
    It  is highly desirable that this subject should receive the attention of
men of science, not only because it bears most directly upon both the cost
and the ef<U+FB01>ciency of future iron-clad <U+FB02>eets, but also because it opens up
 a theoretical question which has hitherto,           I believe, received absolutely no
consideration from scienti<U+FB01>c writers upon the forms and resistances of
 ships, viz. the manner in which the weight of the material composing the
 hull should in<U+FB02>uence the form.            Prior to the design of the ‘ Bellerophon,’
the forms of ships were determined in complete disregard of this considera
tion; and even the most recent works upon the subject incite the naval
architect to aim always at approaching the form of least resistance.                   The
investigations      given in   the  Paper   show,   however,    that  the  adoption   of  a.
form    of  least  resistance,   or  of small   comparative    resistance,   may,  in fact,
lead to a lavish outlay upon our ships, and to a great sacri<U+FB01>ce of ef<U+FB01>ciency ;
while, on the other hand, the adoption of a form of greater resistance would
contribute in certain classes of ships to greater economy and to superior
ef<U+FB01>ciency.

1868.]                  and Weight      ofIron-clad Skips.                     307
    In  order to indicate clearly, but approximately] only, the purpose in
view, the author    <U+FB01>rst considers the hypothetical cases of a long and a
shorter ship, both of which are prismatic in a vertical sense.        The length
of the long ship is seven times its breadth, and its horizontal sections con
sist of two triangles set base to base; the length of the short ship is <U+FB01>ve
times its breath, the middle      portion being parallel for two-<U+FB01>fths of the
length,   and  the ends  being wedge-shaped.        It is assumed also that at a
speed of 14 knots the long ship will give a constant of 600, and the short
ship a constant of 500 in the Admiralty formula,
                                    a
                              speed   x mid. section
                             indicated horse-power.
    The draught of water is in each          case 25   feet, and the total  depth
50 feet.
    It is taken for granted that the form of the long ship has been found
satisfactory for a ship of such scantlings that we may consider her built
of iron of a uniform thickness of 6 inches, the top and bottom being
weightless.
    Now, let it be required to design a ship of equal speed, draught of water,
and depth, but of such increased scantlings (whether of hull proper or of
armour) that the weight shall be equivalent to a uniform thickness of
 12 inches of iron, the top and bottom being weightless as before.           First,
the new ship has the proportions of the long ship given to her; and
secondly, those of the shorter ship.       In each case the engines are supposed
to develope seven times their nominal horse-power, and to weigh (with
boilers, water, &c.) 1 ton per nominal H.P. The coal-supply in each case
equals the weight of the engines, so that both ships will steam the same
distance at the same speed.      But as the equipment of the smaller ship will
be less weighty than that of the larger ship, we will require the larger ship
to carry 2000 tons, and the smaller 1500 tons additional weights.
    Assuming the breadth extreme in each case to be the unknown,           we can,
from the Admiralty formula given above, deduce an expression for the
 Indicated Horse-Power; thence, under the assumed conditions, the weights
of engines and coals can be found; and these being added to the weights
of bull (calculated on the assumption that the sides are of 12-inch iron),
and to the weights carried, give an expression for the total displacement,
in tons, of each ship.     Another expression is found for this displacement
 by <U+FB01>nding   the weight of water displaced. The two expressions are equated,
 and a quadratic equation is formed. from which the breadth           extreme is
 determined ; and from it all the other values can be found.
    The accompanying Table shows the results obtained by this method for
 the two classes of ships :—

      It will therefore be seen that, by adopting the proportions and form of
  the shorter ship, a ship of the required scantlings and speed will be ob
  tained on a length of 342 feet and a breadth of 68% feet; whereas if the
  proportions       of the long ship are adopted, the ship, although of the same
  scantlings       and    speed only, will require to be 581 feet long and 83 feet
   broad, the steam-power in both cases being as nearly as possible the same.
      Considerations of this character, worked out more fully, led the designer
  of the ‘ Bellerophon’ to depart so considerably from the form and propor
  tions of the ‘ Warrior.’
      The next part of the investigation is based upon the of<U+FB01>cial reports of
 ‘the measured mile trials of the ‘ Minotaur’ and ‘ Bellerophon’ when fully
-
  rigged, and upon calculations made from the drawings of those ships.                          It
*is assumed that a prismatic vessel having the same mean draught as each
>of these
              ships, and having the same form and dimensions as the mean hori
-‘ zontal  section (which equals the mean displacement in cubic'feet, divided
  by   the  mean draught of water),ywill give the same constant as the ship
"herself, at the assumed speed of 14 knots, which, as nearly as possible,
                                                         ‘                    ‘              ’
  equals the speed obtained by both the Minotaur’ and Bellerophon                              on
  the measured mile. 1- For each ship the weight of the armour and backing
  i supposed to be uniformly distributed over vertical prismatic sides of the
  dimensions of the armoured sides; and the weight of hull is similarly dis
  tributed over vertical prismatic sides of the dimensions below water of the
  mean horizontal section,               and above water of the armoured side.               The
  actual weights carried by the ships are thus transferred to what may be
  termed representative prismatic vessels, having the same constant of per
  formance as the ships.                The detailed calculations in the Paper show that
the weight per square foot of the material in the hulls of the two ships,
-'when distributed over the sides of the representative prismatic vessels, is
way      nearly the same- for both; and. the same holds with respect to the
  weight per square foot of armour and backing.                       The ‘ Minotanr’ is rather
   heavier in both respects;               but, for the reasons given in the Paper, the
   means of the values found for the two ships are taken, and are found to be

implying, of course, that the same constants of performance as before
will be realized in each case.    On account of the great disproportion                                              in

                                                                     is
additional weights of the smaller ship (exclusive of engines, boilers, and
coals) amount to 700 tons, and those of the larger ship to 1000 tons. The
developed power of the engines, proportionate supply of coal, and the
weight of engines &c. are taken exactly the                                same     as in the          hypothetical
case <U+FB01>rst given.
   By proceeding with the investigation for each case in way similar to                       a
that sketched for the hypothetical ships, only treating the breadth extreme
of the mean horizontal sections of the new ships as the unknown, the fol
lowing results are obtained.      The new ship of the Minotaur’ type which        ‘
ful<U+FB01>ls the required conditions will be nearly 490 feet long, 72% feet breadth
extreme, and have total displacement of 14,253 tons; while the new ship
                               a
of the ‘Bellerophon’ type will be 380 feet long, 71 feet breadth extreme,
and have      total displacement ,of 10,950 tons.

    Taking the cost per ton at £55 (which is the average cost per ton of
tonnage for the bulls of armour-clad ships), the saving made by adopting
                                                 ’
the new ship of the ‘ Bellerophon                  type would amount to £283,250, or
considerably more than a quarter of a million sterling.                      It must also be
considered that the ship of the ‘Bellerophon’ type would cost less for
maintenance and repair, and be much handier in action.
    The last investigation in the Paper is purely theoretical, and consists of
a determination        of the dimensions which would be required in two ships of
which the horizontal sections are curves of sines, and which are prismatic
vertically, if they were built with the same weight per square foot of bull
                          ‘
(say 1 ton) as the Bellerophon,’ but carried twice the weight of armour
per square foot (say                ton). In these cases the bottom is taken to have
weight      as  well as  the     sides  ; the speed for both is 14 knots, the draught of
water is 25 feet, and the depth of the armoured side ‘24 feet.                     One of the
ships is seven times her breadth in length, and the other is <U+FB01>ve times.
Professor Rankine's rule for the calculation of horse-power and speed is
employed; and the              same    conditions    of engines &c.   are  assumed as have
been     indicated previously.             The larger ship carries 1350 tons additional
weights, and the smaller 900 tons.
    The results obtained for these ships are as follows, when expressed in
round numbers         :-——
                                                      Larger ship.      Smaller ship.

    These      results are very different in detail from those obtained in the
 cases    based    on the actual trials of the ‘Bellerophon’ and ‘Miuotaur.’
 The     2000 H.P. which is needed by the larger ship above the power
 required by the smaller ship, is principally due to the difference between
 the immersed surfaces of the two ships, and is spent in overcoming friction.
 The immersed midship sections, it will be remarked, only differ by a very
                                                                                 ’
 small amount.
     This last investigation           serves to show that, the theoretical best form of
 ship being taken, and the most recent rule being applied in the calcula_
 tions, the speed of 14 knots can be obtained in the short type of ship at a
 surprisingly less cost and size than the long type requires; and this result
 agrees    with that of the preceding investigation             based on actual trials.

    The ‘Northumberland is a ship of 6621 tons, built at Millwall, River
Thames; head N. 39%° E. magnetic, and completed with the armour-plates
iu the same direction : the launch was effected on 17th April 1866; she
 then lay for eight months in the Victoria Docks, head S. 22° W. magnetic,
 or in a direction nearly opposite to that occupied in building.
    From January to March 1867 she lay at Sheerness swinging to wind and
 tide: the ship was then removed to Devonport and placed in dry dock,
 head S. 84° E. magnetic, where she has remained till the present time.   Ob
 servations of deviation and horizontal and vertical force were made at the
 standard    compass (elevated 8% feet from the iron deck, and 172 feet
 distant  from   the stem), the poop-, and two steering-compasses (starboard
 and port), the latter being on the quarter-deck below the poop-compass,—
 the group being placed near the steering-wheel,     52 feet  from  the stern,
 and each compass 4 feet above its own deck.
    The polar force at each compass was originally directed to the part of
 the ship which was south in building; it diminished in the Victoria Docks,
 showed a tendency to return to its original value at Sheerness; and <U+FB01>nally
 alarge force to starboard was developed by the position of the ship in
 dock for the lengthened period at Devonport.
    Tables are appended giving the magnetic coef<U+FB01>cients for each compass
 from time to time, extending from 17th April 1866 to 10th December
  1867.
    The results show that the greater part of the polar magnetism was
 caused by the subpermanent magnetism of the whole mass of the ship,
 due to her position in building and afterwards:      this polar force was so
 great as to require correction by magnets in addition to the usual tabular
 corrections.

    The       Northumberland          was the subject of a singular           attempt to
 “ depolarize” her, by the Patentee of a process “ for an improved method
of correcting the deviation of compasses in iron ships”*.
    The attempt was made—<U+FB01>rst, on the 4th August 1866, in Victoria Docks,
by moving electromagnets over the external plates of the ship, but without
effect; next at Sheerness. in January 186 7 -—a similar process without e<U+FB01>'cct ;
then by applying electromagnets to the beams of the poop—deck, in imme
diate proximity to the poop- and two steering-compasses, and with consider
able e<U+FB01>'ect, as a powerful north pole of a subpermancnt quality was de
veloped in the centre of those beams (about 5 feet abaft the compasses),
producing a repulsive force on the poop- and steering-compasses amounting
nearly to two-thirds of the earth’s force.
    By this the semicircular         deviation   of the poop and port steering-com
passes     was reduced to      g}   of its original   amount,    returning, however, in
the course of a year (eleven months), as determined by observations made
in June, August, and December 1867, to                   of its original amount.       The
deviation of the starboard steering-compass was altered slightly in amount,
and largely in direction; but is now, in common with that of the two' com
passes    just named, gradually returning to its original state.
   The deviation of the standard compass was not affected by the operations
in the slightest degree.
    The “heeling” deviation of the poop-compass was affected in nearly
the same way as its semicircular              deviation: the “healing” deviation of
the starboard steering-compass was increased; but the increase, like the
decrease of the poop-compass, was fast disappearing in December 1867.

                                April  2, 1868.
            Lieut.-General    SABINE, President, in the Chair.
   The following communication      was read :—
“
   Report of the Committee on the Melbourne Telescope to the Presi
       dent and Council of the Royal Society.”          Communicated by the
       President.
   The Committee were informed by Mr. Grubb at the close of last year that
the telescope was ready for their <U+FB01>nal examination;        but the bad weather
which has prevailed in Ireland ever since precluded all trials of its optical
power till February 17, when they met at        Mr. Grubb’s     works   in Ratli
mines Road.
    1. The telescope was not <U+FB01>nished at the time named in the contract       ;  but
the Committee      have ascertained   that the delay arose solely      from     un
favourable weather, which not only impeded the actual work of polishing,
but for weeks together made it impossible to test the <U+FB01>gure of the specula.
They considered that it was far more important           to send out a perfect
instrument   than to keep the exact time.
   2. The Committee, after minutely and carefully studying the mechanical
details of the equatorial, have come unanimously to the conclusion that it
is a masterpiece of engineering.     Its movements are surprisingly smooth
and steady; it can be moved to any portion of the sky, even if it have to
be reversed from one side of its pier to the other, in less than a minute by
two operators and with very little exertion.
   The clock is smooth and equable in its action, it is very powerful, and
quite equal to its work.    Great change of rate, as from sidereal to lunar
time, is effected by an ingenious piece of di<U+FB02>'crential gearing ; small changes
are made by a cam adjustment ; moreover it rings seconds, for the double
object of comparing its rate with a chronometer       and to assist the observer
in his observations.
   3. The Committee are strongly impressed by the great convenience to
the observer of the arrangements of the hour and polar-distance circles, the
facility of controlling their adjustment, and the easy access to the eyepiece.
   4. The stability of the tube was severely tested, both in respect of its
general stiffness and its power of resisting torsion, such as might be pro
duced by the weight of the small speculum when the telescope is off the
                                                                           '
meridian; and the results were highly satisfactory.
   5. In large re<U+FB02>ecting telescopes it is usual to make provision for keeping
a given diameter    of the great speculum always in a vertical plane. When
they   are equatorially mounted, this is done by rotating the tube in its
cradle.    Here the tube does not turn ; but there is a special arrangement
of hoop-suspension, by which, whatever diameter may be vertical, it is
supported in a uniform and symmetrical manner.            The system of trian

gular levers at the back of the great speculum is also contrived so as to
prevent them from exerting any pressure which might distort it.                This is
a matter of the highest importance, and the attention of the Committee
was specially directed to it.       They examined it most carefully, putting the
telescope in various positions of [R and P. D. on each side of the meridian,
both by day and night, and could not <U+FB01>nd any sign of <U+FB02>ezure or any dis
tortion of the image in any of these chanyes.
   6. In order to test the optical power of the second speculum B (the
<U+FB01>rst one, A, had been tried and approved by a member of the Com
mittee on October       12 last), the telescope was directed to the following
objects   :—In    the  daytime Venus and a Andromedae;                at night (which
fortunately was clear and steady) Castor, the Great Nebula of Orion,                  I
Orionis, -y Andromedae, Uranus, l Messier, 37 Messier, 46 Messier, and
     Messier, from    which it will    be seen   that both the light-collecting and
de<U+FB01>ning powers of the instrument were fairly tried.             The powers used were
220 (the lowest which can take in the entire pencil), 350, and 450, all
negatives.      Of course one would not propose such an instrument             for the
measurement       of close double stars, work for which telescopes such as
those of Poulkova and Harvard are possibly better <U+FB01>tted; but the Com
mittee found that the light even of large stars was collected into small,
hard, and perfectly circular disks, free from rays; and though some
diffused light' surrounded them, it was exactly concentric with the central
disks.     The 5th and 6th stars of the Trapezium of Orion were not only
plainly seen, but were very bright; Z Orionis was well shown, and the
companion of y Andromedae was clearly divided with the powers of 350
and 450, and the different tints of the components were evident.               Uranus
was well seen, but was surrounded by such a multitude of very minute
stars that, without access to the tables of his satellites, it was impossible
to know whether any of them were seen-t.              37 M. was broken into a heap
of stars so large and brilliant that it quite lost the character of a cluster.
The planetary Nebula in 46 M. brought out most strikingly the light
collccting power of this telescope ; for it (which in most telescopes appears
as a faint   disk) was revealed as a ring, bright even on the dazzling ground
of the surrounding stars, which here were as brilliant as the components of
the Pleiades appear in ordinary instruments.             With  respect to the Nebulae,
it is needless to say more than that Lord Rosse considers its performance
in bringing out the details of the Orion Nebula, l M. (the Crab), and
51 M. (the Great Spiral), quite satisfactory.
    7. The Committee had no opportunity of testing the spectroscope on
  * The cause of this dill~used light has since been discovered and removed.
   1' On the 19th of Febmary,       however, the Committee had the advantage of the
presence of Mr. hssell in the examination of Uranus among other objects with Speculum
A, and, guided by his familiarity with that object, they were enabled to make out stars,
the positions of which, with great probability, corresponded to the places of the two
most distant, and one of the nearest satellites.

 1868.]     Report of the Committee on the Melbourne Telescope.              315
 stellar  or nebular   spectra; but they have tried it on solar and electric
 ones, and consider    that it will be very effective, from the solidity of its
 structure, and its large dispersion combined with a small deviation.
     8. The balance of the grant, which will probably be absorbed by the
 expense of packing the instrument for removal, was not suf<U+FB01>cient to justify
 the Committee in ordering a photographic apparatus which should be
 worthy of the telescope ; but some trials have been made with a “ makeshift
 affair,” which con<U+FB01>rm them in their opinion that it is most important to
 turn to account the photographic power of this magni<U+FB01>cent instrument,
 not only for the moon, but for the planets and the sun.         On two or three
 occasions Castor and the moon were taken with this temporary apparatus :
 as to the star, its components impressed their images in good measurable
 disks in times varying from two to eight seconds; with respect to the
 moon, on February 1, when she was seven days old, and the air good, a
 remarkably hard and sharp picture, full of minute details, was obtained,
 which exhibits so strongly the great photographic power of the instrument,
 that they would regard it as a serious loss to science if this was not most
 fully brought into action.       This is the more desirable because lunar and
 solar photography would utilize a considerable portion of time, during
 which the observing of nebulae is impossible.      After full inquiry, the Com
 mittee <U+FB01>nd that the cost of the necessary apparatus for this work, including
 a micrometer for measuring distances and positions on the photographs
 (like. that described in the Philosophical Transactions, 1862, p. 373), could
 be provided for a sum not exceeding £400 ; and they earnestly hope that
 so valuable an addition     may be made.      They have been given to under
 stand that the Melbourne Government           have resolved on putting a roof
 over the instrument,    but that they think it can hc more economically con
  structed there than here.      In this case it occurs to the Committee that
 the second form of roof described in Dr. Robinson’s letter might be pre
 ferable to the more complex one there recommended; and as it would be
 less costly, the difference would more than cover the expense of the photo
 graphic apparatus.      In this hope they have directed Mr. Grubb to prepare
 a detailed plan of that apparatus and of the second form of roof.           The
 Committee conclude by stating that they have no hesitation in declaring

     A   detailed    examination of the fauna and <U+FB02>ora exhibits results remark
 ably     in  accordance with the views expressed by Mr. Sclater and Dr.
 Giinther on the geographical distribution of species. Palestine forms an
 extreme southern province of the Palaearctic region.
     In every class, however, there are a group of peculiar forms, which can
 not be explained simply by the fact of Palestine impinging closely on the
 Ethiopian, and more distantly on the Indian region, but which require a
 reference to the geological history of the country.

  Several of the Ethiopian Mammalia are sedentary forms, and seem to
point to an earlier settlement than across the recent deserts. There is no
trace of any immigration    from the Indian region.    Of the peculiar species,
Hyrax syriacus belongs     to an exclusively Ethiopian and isolated type, yet is
speci<U+FB01>cally   di<U+FB02>'erent from its congeners, which are all most sedentary in
their habits.
   The Avifauna is very rich in number of species, most unequally distri
buted.   The Ethiopian and Indian types are almost exclusively con<U+FB01>ned to
the Dead-Sea basin, excepting only the desert forms.        There are several
Indian species, as Ketupa ceylonensis, which have no af<U+FB01>nities with any
Ethiopian forms.    Of the peculiar species, besides several modi<U+FB01>cations of
well-known Palsearctic forms, there are eleven, belonging to as many dif
ferent Ethiopian and Indian genera.    Three of these are decidedly Indian
in their af<U+FB01>nities.  The Avifauna of the Dead-Sea basin is decidedly
distinct and typical, sometimes Indian, more generally Ethiopian in its
character.
   In the Reptilia there is a less prominent intrusion of Ethiopian types,
there being a general similarity to the Egyptian herpetological fauna, which
must be classed within the Palaearctic region.    The Indian is present in
Daboia want/zinc; and the af<U+FB01>nities of a new genus R<U+FB01>ynchocalamus are
rather    obscure.   Snakes     in particular are more limited to the original
locality of the individuals,     and the groups, like the individuals, are more
stationary.
   The <U+FB02>uviatileichthyological fauna is much more distinct, though the
number of species is small.   In its consideration we con<U+FB01>ne ourselves to
the Jordan and its tributaries, in which are three Nilotic <U+FB01>shes, three
others extending eastward in Asia, six to other rivers of Syria, and four
peculiar, bearing a strong af<U+FB01>nity to the species and genera (as Chromis
and Hemiclzromis) of tropical Eastern Africa.
     Of
      the Mollusca, most of the peculiar species have no geographical sig
ni<U+FB01>cation.  The Pulmonifera have developed in groups, which are modi<U+FB01>
cations of desert types in the south, and of Mediterranean forms on the
coast.    Variation in this class appears rapidly to follow segregation, as
shown by the Jordanic species.      The <U+FB02>uviatile mollusca are much more
distinct, and indicate a very ancient separation from any adjacent district.
   Similar inferences may be drawn from the examination of the Arachnida,
Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, and Orthoptera, as well as from the Rhizopod
fauna, which is similar to that of the Indian Ocean. (The examination of
the Coleoptera is not yet completed.)
   The <U+FB02>ora of Palestine       is,
                            on the coastline and highlands, simply repro a
duction of that of the Eastern Mediterranean. That of the Jordan valley
is most distinct.  Of 113 species by the Dead Sea, only 27 are European,
and these chie<U+FB02>y weeds of world-wide distribution.         In   this area the <U+FB02>ora
is almost exclusively Ethiopian, consisting largely       of species extending
from the Canaries to India.

318                     On the Fauna and Flora of Palestine.             [Apr. 23,
     Thus in the Dead-Sea basin, an area of but a few square miles, we <U+FB01>nd
a series    of forms of life in all classes, differing from those of the surround
ing region, to which they do not extend, and having Ethiopian and, more
strictly, Indian af<U+FB01>nities.       The basin is depressed 1300 feet below the sea
level; and as zones of elevation correspond to parallels of latitude, so here
a zone of depression represents the fauna and <U+FB02>ora of a low latitude.             If
the <U+FB02>ora were representative, this law, that climatal zones of life are mutu
ally repeated and represented by elevation or depression and latitude, would
 account for their existence.
     But we have a transported <U+FB02>ora ; this negatives the idea of an indepeu_
 dent origin on the spot.       The theory of migration, under present conditions,
 is refuted by the coexistence of peculiar and unique forms, with others now
 found in regions widely apart.         Of these, the physical character, and the
 phenomena       of  their present distribution,  present insuperable obstacles to
 their migration under existing geological conditions.
     Their existence must be mainly due to dispersion before the isolation of
 the area; this must have been after the close of the Eocene period, to
 which belong the most recent super<U+FB01>cial deposits of Southern Palestine.
 There are no beds synchronizing with the miocene deposits of Sicily, Szc. ;
 it must have had a fauna and <U+FB02>ora contemporaneous with the miocene <U+FB02>ora
 of Germany.         There is geological evidence that since the Eocene period the
  Jordan <U+FB01>ssure has had no connexion with the Red Sea or Mediterranean.
 There are subsequent vast marl deposits of the Dead Sea when it was at a
 higher level, but they are wholly unfossiliferous.         The diminution of the
 waters may, for reasons given, be <U+FB01>xed about the close of the tertiary
 epoch.       We have also evidence of the extension of the glacial period thus
  far south, as in the moraines of Lebanon.
      Still the lake existed before the glacial epoch in its present form, when
  there was an unusually warmer climate, and the more antique Ethiopian
  fauna and <U+FB02>ora had a more northerly extension.          This would be contempo
  raneous with the miocene continent of Atlantis, and the Asturian <U+FB02>ora of
  South-west     Ireland.             .
      Palestine would then be East African.          Afterwards the glacial inroad
  would destroy the mass of preexisting life, excepting the few species most
   tenacious of existence which survive in the still comparatively warm de
                      J
  pression of the ordau valley, which thus became a tropical
                                                                    “ outlier," ana
  logous to the boreal marine outliers of our own seas.        The Indian types are
   explained by the former continuous miocene continent from India to
   Africa. The peculiar species may either yet be found in Arabia, or, if not,
   may be descendants of species which inhabited the country with a limited
   range, or may be variations stereotyped by isolation.
      The peculiar <U+FB01>shes of the Jordan are most important,         dating probably
   from the earliest period after the elevation of the land.      The genera of the
   peculiar species are exclusively African, while the species are representative
   rather than identical.      We may explain this by the miocene chain of fresh

water lakes, extending from Galilee to the N yanza, Nyassa, and Zambesi,
when an ichthyological fauna was developed suited to the warm conditions
that prevailed, part of which survives in the Jordan.
     During the glacial period the temperature of Lebanon must have been
similar to the present Alps, as the existing mammals and birds on the
summits are identical with those of the Pyrenees and the Alps; not so the
glacial <U+FB02>ora, of which almost every trace has been lost.        But the <U+FB02>ora had
not the same powers of vertical migration with the fauna, of which, how
ever, the Elk, Red Deer, and Reindeer, found in the bone-caverns, have
long since perished.
     During the present period the Mediterranean       forms have overspread the
 whole country, excepting the mountain-tops         at an elevation of 9000 feet,
 and the Jordan depression.         These two exceptions can be best explained
 by the fact that the traces of the glacial inroad are not yet wholly oblite—
 rated, and that the preceding warm period has left its yet stronger mark in
 the unique tropical “ outlier” of the Dead-Sea basin, analogous to the
 boreal    outliers of our mountain-tops, the concave depression       in the one
 being the complement of the convex elevation in the other.

                                      (Abstract.)
      We are already acquainted with a considerable number of crystals,
  natural as well as arti<U+FB01>cial, the forms of which have only been determined
  with precision by the examination of their optical properties as doubly
  refracting   bodies.    Harmotome    and Wiihlerite furnish twovfresh examples
  of this; and they a<U+FB02>‘ord all the more important proof of the necessity of
  appealing to these properties, inasmuch as the crystals of these substances
  would appear certainly to be derived from a right rhombic prism, so long
  as we consider     only the apparent symmetry of their external forms, or the
  orientation    of the plane containing their optic axes.   The different sorts of
   dispersion which these axes might be capable of presenting are so feeble,
  and so di<U+FB01>icult of appreciation on account of the slight transparency of
  \Viihlerite, and the complex structure of the crystals of Harmotomc, that
   the determination of these dispersions has hitherto been too incomplete to
   allow of any conclusion being drawn as to the crystalline type they might
   otherwise serve to characterize.
      It  was a remark    of M. Axel Gadolin that induced the author to resume
   the attentive study of the phenomena of dispersion, <U+FB01>rst in Harmotomc,
   and then in WUhlerite, and as a consequence to modify the crystallographic
   type to which these minerals have been in general referred.

  320       0n   the  Optic Axes in Hurmotome and        W dklerite.     [Apr. 23,
                                    Harmotome.
     Several years ago the author showed that simple crystals of Harmotome
  did not exist, and that those of Strontian in Scotland (Morvenite), considered
  as such, prevented, in fact, a twinning formed by the interpenetration         of
  two principal individuals.     The particular orientation of the plane of the
 optic axes in each of the crystals of which the least complicated of such
 groups are composed had led him to refer their crystalline form to a right
 rhombic prism of 124° 47'; and he had been induced to look on this prism
 as presenting a peculiar sort of hemihedrism, or rather hemimorphism,
 such that only one—half of the fundamental rhombic octahedron existed,
 that namely formed of four faces parallel two and two, and lying in the
 same zone.       More recently, in studying the modi<U+FB01>cations which heat
 induces in the position of the optic axes and of their plane, he observed a
 phenomenon less compatible with the hypothesis of a primitive rhombic
 form; but the slight transparency of the plates on which he operated, the
 wide separation of the optic axes, which rendered the examination of the
 two systems of rings almost imposible in air, and <U+FB01>nally the almost com
 plete absence of dispersion, led him to regard the observed result as an
 apparent anomaly, attributable to the highly complex structure of the
 crystals.
    Desirous of verifying the truth of a suggestion communicated to him by
 M. Gadolin in June 1867, the author had some new plates cut normal to
 the acute, positive bisectrix from very transparent crystals of the Scotch
 Morvenite,   and he has been able to establish the existence of a very decided
twisted dispersion.      In consequence of the smaller mutual inclination of
the optic axes in these than in the former plates, the author was also able
to satisfy himself directly that the displacement impressed by heat on the
plane containing these axes is a rotary one, quite analogous to that which
he had shown to exist in borax and Heulaudite.              It is therefore now
beyond doubt that the crystalline type of Harmotome is the oblique rhombic
prism, and the author has corrected the crystallographic            description of
the mineral accordingly.
                                     W'b'klerite.
    In his ‘Mauual of Mineralogy,’ the author had described the crystals
of \Viihlerite as derivable froma prism of very nearly 90°. From the
point of view from which a consideration of the orientation of their optic
axes had induced       him to regard   them, they appeared to offer a certain
number of homohedral         forms associated with forms that were hemihedral
or hemimorphic,      analogous to those that he had drawn attention to in
Harmotome.        Having proved that the latter mineral belongs to the clino
rhombic system, he endeavoured to ascertain whether this was not also the
case with Wdhlerite, all the forms of which would in that event be homo
hedral.    But in this case a study of the different varieties of dispersion is
rendered dit<U+FB01>cult by the yellow colour, and by the imperfect transparency

                                                                                           '

presented by the substance even when in very thin plates.  Besides this,
contrary to what is found in Harmotome, while the dispersion belonging
to the optic axes is very distinct, the horizontal and twisted dispersions,
which should be sought for in plates normal to the two bisectrices, are,
on the contrary, but slightly evident.   However, on examining in oil some
 thin plates placed so as to have the plane of their optic axes horizontal and
 perpendicular to the plane of polarization, the author observed in the plates
 normal to the obtuse, positive bisectrix, some faint blue and red fringes,
 dispersed in contrary directions above and below the bars which traverse
 the two systems of rings, indicating the existence of an appreciable twisted
 dispersion.  In the plates normal to the acute, negative bisectrix, the
transverse bar of each system is bordered on one side by a very pale blue,
and on the opposite side by an equally pale Yellow, the horizontal dispersion
being thus feebly indicated.
   The crystals of Wiihlerite ought, then, to be referred to an oblique
rhombic prism, in which the plane of symmetry is normal to the plane
which contains their optic axes.   The primitive form which it seems most
convenient to choose is a prism with an angle of very nearly 90°, which
presents a cleavage, easy though interrupted, parallel to its plane of sym—
metry, and cleavages which are more dif<U+FB01>cult in the directions of the lateral
faces m and of the plane        15'

     The author then describes in detail the crystalline form of Wohleritc            as
thus corrected.

the usual law of falling bodies; and the mean horizontal velocity being
thus known for a series of different ranges, we can calculate the mean ve
locity for every      100 yards     of  a long range, and     thence determine      the  re
sistance.
      The author commenced his calculations from an assumed velocity of
 1360 feet per second, in accordance with the results obtained at short
 ranges, and assumed for trial a resistance varying as the square of the
 velocity, but found that this law did not <U+FB01>t the results at all.                  A resist
 ance varying as the cube of the velocity was then tried, and found very
 nearly to agree with the results of observation;                and the agreement be
 came,     we may say, perfect,       when the assumed initial velocity was slightly
 corrected.
      As  the calculations and experiments were all made without any notion of
 the resulting law, and without any knowledge of the work already done by
 Professor Hélie and Professor Bashforth, they afford a remarkable con<U+FB01>r
 mation      of the results obtained by those gentlemen.                This is the more
 worthy      of  notice,  as  their  data  belong    to pieces  of  large calibre, and the
  author’s to small arms.
  IV. “ Remarks on the Great Nebula in Orion.”                      In  a Letter addressed
          to Prof. G. G. STOKES,          Sec.  R.S.    By W. Lassen, F.R.S.            Re
          ceived February        28, 1868.
       I have been so much interested by the perusal of Lord Oxmantown’s
  observations and drawing of the Great Nebula in OrionI published in the
  present volume of the ‘Transactions,’ that _I venture to offer you a few
  remarks upon them—the more readily, as                 I may be supposed to be some
  what familiar with that objcct, though observed with less advantage of
   optical power.
       On comparing the present drawing with my own, made with the four
   feet equatorial during my late sojourn at Malta,             I  <U+FB01>nd that of the 93 new
   stars in Lord Oxmantown’s list, there are, I believe, only 24 within the
   more limited area of my drawing.                A good many of these have escaped
   my    notice,  while,  on   the   other  hand,   I have detected several which I do
   not <U+FB01>nd     in the  present    Catalogue.    The   following are instances of a few :—
   Three stars north-preceding          No.  119;    four  stars about the hypothenuse
   of the nearly right-angled triangle formed by the stars 47, 52, and 53;
   two stars in the triangle formed by 30, 32, and 35 ; a delicate point about
   20" from 104, with several others.              Some of these I have so repeatedly
   and certainly     seen,   that  I wonder    not to <U+FB01>nd them here.        The explanation
   of this discrepancy may possibly in some instances be found in variability,
    but must, I think, be rather sought for in the in<U+FB02>uence which the state of
    atmosphere has on such delicate objects, when the highest combinations                  of
    light and power are brought to bear upon them.                   As this is a nebula    of

great extent, it is possible, and indeed probable, that there may be some
spots on which the concentrated attention of any single observer has not
been given under the most favourable circumstances.             In my own observa
tions, the question of resolvability appeared always an interesting one to
settle, and therefore      I gave quite as much       attention  to the detection of
stars as to the tracing of the nebula.
    The present drawing embracing much more of the extent of this nebula
than mine (if not, indeed, the whole of it), I am able to compare mine with
it only in part; but, so far as my limits extend, the representations are
generally very coincident.        In some parts there is a greater hardness than
I   have seen; but it is scarcely possible to convey a true impression of the
form of the convolutions of the nebula without intensifying them in some
 degree.      I recognized in my own observations more of the spiral or scroll
like character of the nebula about the stars 51 and 57, <U+FB01>rst pointed out, I
believe, by Mr. Bond, than I <U+FB01>nd in this drawing.             In an engraving sent
 to me by Mr. Bond in 1863, in which photography had, as I understood,
 been employed, this scroll-like appearance is strongly marked.
     On the question of a real change of form of the nebula, no positive con
 clusion can, I think, as yet he arrived at; but as we have probably now
 reached much more nearly to the practical limit of optical power in our
 telescopes, future observations may be expected to be much more com
 parable with existing drawings than these are with those formerly made.
     The evidence of resalvability seems to me to be rather on the negative
 side—-—my own deductions from what I have seen have been always in that
 direction ; and such of the present observations as apparently look the other
 way are,     I consider, too vague and wanting      in precision  and certainty,  to
  establish it positively.
                                [Received April 17, 1838.]
     In    the account of my observations in Malta with the four-foot equa
  torial, published in the 36th volume of the Memoirs of the Royal Astro
  nomical     Society, there is but a slight reference to the Great Nebula of
  Orion;     the immediate reason for which was, that the drawing        I had made
  was on too large a scale for appearing therein         as an engraving,  and I  was
  unwilling to subject it to a reduction of size.
     Moreover, as Lord Osmantown’s elaborate description and drawings of
  this incomparable object have recently appeared in the Transactions of the
  Royal Society, and as the subject may be presumed to be a very interesting
  one,   I  beg leave to request of the Society their acceptance of my original
  drawing     (Forwarded this day), which contains the sum of all I have been
  able to make out (both of the details of the nebula and of the stars therein)
   with the above telescope during my tln'ee-years’ residence in the Island of
   Malta.
     I also subjoin    from my Journal the following few notes relative to some

324              Mr. W. Lassell       on the Great Nebula in Orion.         [Apr. 23,
of the more interesting stars.           The <U+FB01>fth star of the trapezium is reddish,
and has a pretty broad and not very brilliant disk,—much larger than that
of the sixth, which is more brilliant, and whiter.          Yet the <U+FB01>rst impression
of the <U+FB01>fth on the eye is more forcible than that of the sixth.
    Adopting Herschel’s numbers, 57 is much less bright than 51. The
star marked       II  is nearly as bright as 57; but the two stars south-following
II   are the smallest points visible.
    Of    the delicate pair preceding      5 of the trapezium, the following star is
the brightest.
    The minute        stars preceding and north-following 93, were undoubtedly
veri<U+FB01>ed; but there         seemed a want of precision in the image of the latter
 (if  one may so speak of such a faint thing) which suggested the idea               of
its being double.
    Herschel’s 78, 82, and        91 have on no occasion been recognized;       a star,
however, has been seen as laid down in the drawing,               a very little south
following the place of 78.
    In   the drawing, Herschel's numbers are adopted throughout; and for
convenience of reference and identi<U+FB01>cation, they are attached in minute
<U+FB01>gures to each star.          Its scale, as given at the foot, is 100": 1194 inch.
All    the stars which have been certainly and repeatedly seen are inserted,
and,     I  believe, no others.         Some attempt at indication     of respective
magnitude        has been made in depicting the stars, but their estimated
magnitudes are more precisely given in the margins, right and left of the
picture.      They are, however, more fully laid down in the following Cata
logue of the stars contained in the map, the places being principally taken
from Liaponov’s measures.              A good many of the stars, however,       I have
 independently       measured,   and though my means for this especial purpose
were probably        inferior to those of M. Liaponov,    I have added a list    of my
measures for comparison or identi<U+FB01>cation.

pulmonary artery, and I have. not been able to discover any observations
later than his.    After speaking of the formation of the aorta. and pul
monary artery by the division of the humans arteriasus into two vessels,
this being, as is well known, the large single arterial trunk conveying the
blood from the rudimentary       ventricle into the branchial    arteries, he
        “                 with  the  division the semilunar  valves  also be
says", Simultaneously
come developed, and      I
                      saw them already present in both arteries in an em
bryo of the seventh week. They are, however, at <U+FB01>rst nothing but hori
zontally projecting crescentic growths of the middle and of the epithelial
coats by which the lumen 1' at this spot receives the form of a three~raycd
star.   At what time they <U+FB01>rst become visible as distinct pockets have notI
yet investigated.”
   The division of the truncus arterioaus is described by Rathke as occur—
ring in birds and mammalia by the formation on its interior of two oppo
sitely situated longitudinal ridges, which then grow together throughout
its whole extent and completely divide the vessel into two lateral halves,
one representing     the commencement of the aorta, and the other that of the
pulmonary   artery.  Though the semilunar valves are said by Kolliker, and
quite correctly, to develope simultaneously with the division, he gives no
information about the manner in which they are connected with        or the   it,
part of the vessel in which they originate, and nowhere are any drawings
given of them in their rudimentary state.      was hence led to conclude
                                                  I
that very little was known about this point, and to make the observations
the results of which are here recorded.     They seem to me valuable, as
throwing light on some of the congenital malformations of this part of the
heart.   They were made during 1865, 1866, and 1867, on the embryos of
the common fowl, and     have had no opportunity of investigating human
                         I
or other mammalian embryos with reference to this point.     But from the
great likeness between the hearts of birds, mammalia, and man at different
periods of their development,      seems pretty certain that the arterial
                                      it
semilunar valves in man and mammalia generally must pass through the
same stages of development as those of the bird, which, in the fully deve
loped state, quite resemble them.
   The eggs were incubated by arti<U+FB01>cial         heat, and the hearts of more than
<U+FB01>fty embryos,       at various    stages   of development,   were examined.         The
embryos were prepared by immersing them, immediately on their removal
from the egg, in strong alcohol.   By this the large vessels were obtained
distended with blood and hardened.    They were afterwards rendered trans~

    The new facts observed demonstrate-—
    (l) The manner in which the truncus arteriosus divides into two vessels,
which is different from that commonly supposed to occur.
     (‘2) The close connexion between this process of division, and the forma
tion of the semilunar valves of the aorta and pulmonary artery, and their
place of origin and mode of development.
    The following is a brief account of the manner in which the division of
the truncus arteriosus takes place.           It should be said that about the third
day of incubation, just before the division begins, the somewhat spirally
twisted     truncus    arteriosus is everywhere smooth, and free from ridges
on its interior,     and ends abruptly in the three pairs of branchial arteries
which then exist.         These are the third, fourth, and <U+FB01>fth pair.          There is
no valvular apparatus at its branchial end, but next the ventricle the de<U+FB01>
ciency of valves seems to be supplied by a considerable development of the
elastic wall of the truncus arteriosus on its two opposite sides, so that the
ventricular    aperture, which is at <U+FB01>rst circular, becomes slit-shaped.           The
two lips of the slit seem to prevent in great measure the re<U+FB02>ux of blood
into the ventricle, before the semilunar valves are su<U+FB02>iciently developed to
 do so.
     The division of the vessel commences about the 106th hour of incuba
 tion, at rather less than one-<U+FB01>fth of the whole period of incubation,           which
 is 21 days.
     It begins     at the branchial    end of the truncus      arteriosus   by the ex
 tension into     it of  a  plane septum growing horizontally downwards into

 fourth and <U+FB01>fth pair of branchial arteries.            Its lower margin is forked, so
 that it extends further along the sides than along the centre of the vessel,
 and it is inclined     a little obliquely    across the vessel, sloping downwards
 from left to right.       The little channel in front of this septum leads to the
  third and fourth pair of branchial         arteries, and is the rudimentary aorta;
 the channel behind        it  leads to the <U+FB01>fth pair of branchial arteries, and is

artery, twistinggradually from left to right, its left leg passing between
and separating  the anterior semilunar valve rudiments, and its right leg
growing into the central portion of the oblique ridge on the posterior sur
face, now becoming prominent and pyramidal, and separating from each
other     the rudiments      of the inner valves.    Between   the outer and inner
scmilunar valves in each artery there is a vacant space left on the wall of
the vessel, from which the outer semilunar valve in each artery afterwards
grows out, the outer valves appearing later than the others.   The division
of the truncus arteriosus proceeds by the gradual growth downwards of the
forked septum along the course of the ridge on the posterior surface, which
gradually becomes more prominent, the right leg of the fork, which pro
ceeds along     being always a little in advance of the other.
               it,                                             The anterior
or left leg of the fork corresponds with the right margin of the anterior
aortic valve, and terminates almost immediately on the anterior surface, no
ridge being formed along the anterior surface as there    along the pos
                                                                is
terior.  As the forked septum between the aorta and pulmonary artery
grows down the vessel, the semilunar valves gradually become more deve
loped, and the rudiments of the outer valves appear.   They appear soon
after the 117th hour of incubation,  by which time the aorta and pulmonary
artery are separated for some little distance.
   During these changes the aperture into the ventricle has become    rect a
angular slit, passing horizontally backwards and to the right, and having       a
left-hand and right-hand lip, the left-hand lip sloping from beforeback
                 a
wards and upwards into the artery, and joining the lower end of the ridge
that has been gradually forming on the posterior surface of the vessel.
As the division proceeds the ends of each lip of the ventricular slit dis
appear, and the central portions, especially of the left-hand lip, become
more prominent.        By this    channel
                                    a          left in front and towards the
                                                is
left, and behind and to the right.        By the time the division has de
scended to the ventricular aperture, the original right-hand leg of the
forked septum has wound round to the centre of the left-hand lip of the
slit, the left-hand leg to the centre of the right-hand lip, so that the aortic
channel has passed from front to back, and the pulmonary channel from
back to front, the anterior portion of the ventricular slit thus becoming
the root of the pulmonary artery, and the posterior portion the root of
the aorta.
   The septum of the ventricles has been gradually forming during the
process of division of the truncus arteriosus, and        by
                                                        the time the division
and  valves have  descended  nearly to the  base of the  ventricles, there re
mains merely an oval aperture in the upper portion uniting the ventricular
cavities. It forms short canal with left ventricular border and right
                         a                  a                             a
ventricular    border.  The arterial infundibula are <U+FB01>nally separated from
each other by   the union   of the lower half of this right ventricular border
with the  lower  border  of the forked arterial septum.   The anterior portion
of the right ventricular border      continued upwards and forwards into the
                                     is

termination of the original right leg of the fork in the central part of the
left-hand lip of the ventricular slit, while the posterior portion passes off
slantingly upwards and forwards as aridge, which forms the termination of
the original left leg of the fork in the central part of the right-hand lip of
the slit.  Thus a twisted, hourglass-shaped aperture connects the arterial
infundibula, by whose closure the pulmonary infundibulum and root of the
pulmonary artery become separated from the root of the aorta and the
canal of the aperture in the septum, which then becomes the aortic infun
dibulum.    This process is completed about the end of the eighth day.
The separation of the vessels does not become visible externally till it has
advanced   a considerable      distance   down the truncus        arteriosus,   and the
semilunar valves are considerably      developed.
   The division of the truncus       arteriosus into the aorta and pulmonary
artery does not therefore       take place by the formation of two oppositely
situated longitudinal  ridges, and their subsequent growth together, but
occurs, as above described, by the extension into it of a plane septum from
between the fourth and <U+FB01>fth pair of branchial arteries, and which twists
down the vessel along the line of a single thick pyramidal ridge which
forms gradually on its posterior aspect.
   The formation of the semilunar valves is very closely connected with the
process of division of the truncus arteriosus, and the following are the new
facts arrived at with respect to their origin and development :—
   1.  It is a remarkable fact that the rudiments of the semilunar valves
<U+FB01>rst  appear on the interior of the truncus arteriosus at a considerable
distance from the heart, near the termination of the truncus arteriosus in
the branchial arteries, and not near the heart, as one might have been led
to expect.
   2. It is also very remarkable that the rudiments of the anterior and
inner semilunar valves of each artery make their appearance before the
partition, which has already begun to separate the aorta from the pulmonary
artery, has quite descended to that part of the truncus arteriosus in which
these valves originate.
  3. The rudiments    of the anterior semilunar valves of the aorta and
pulmonary   artery are the <U+FB01>rst to appear, those of the inner valve of
each artery the next, and those of the outer valves the last. The deve
lopment of the last valve to appear remains behind that of the others
throughout.
   4. The anterior valve-rudiments appear close together, rather on the
right side of the anterior surface of the truncus arteriosus, about the 106th
hour of incubation, simultaneously with the commencement of the division,
and a short distance below        it,
                                    and opposite the commencement of the
ridge which  forms  on  the posterior surface of the vessel, and which appears
about the same time.
  5. The rudiment         of the inner valve of each artery grows from the

3341               On the Development of the Semilunar Valves.           [Apr. 30,
corresponding side of the ridge which forms gradually on the posterior
surface of the vessel, a little later than the anterior valves.
    6.   The rudiment of the outer valve in each artery arises from that part
of the inside of the wall of the truncus arteriosus left vacant between the
outer margins of the rudiments of the anterior and inner valves soon after
the 117th hour of incubation.          It arises level with the other valves, when
the aorta and pulmonary artery are already separated from each other for
some little distance, and therefore a little nearer to the heart than the
other valves, though still at a considerable distance from it.
    7. The anterior valve-rudiments commence as transverse thickenings          of
the interior of the vessel, sloping o<U+FB01>‘ above and below into the general
surface of the vessel, and are separated by a slight groove.
    8. The inner and outer valves <U+FB01>rst appear as simple pyramidal thicken
ings of the vascular wall.
    9.   All  the semiluuar valves are solid at <U+FB01>rst.
    10. The anterior and inner valves consist of one single segment for each
valve.
    11. The outer valve is at <U+FB01>rst a single pyramidal eminence.             It may
remain single, or become deeply notched and develope into two valves, or
even more.
    12.   By    the time the third valve in each vessel has appeared, the form of
                              more de<U+FB01>ned.    They then have the shape of a short
the valves has become
           of triple phosphate
                                    v    its <U+FB02>at surface being attached, its edge
crystal                                ,
projecting into the vessel, and its ends sloping otf upwards and outwards
above, and downwards and outwards below.                The valves are more deve
loped in the direction of their length than transversely, and their course
 down the wall of the vessel is parallel to that which the axis of its canal
 afterwards assumes.
     13. About the 144th hour of incubation they are (though still solid and
 at some distance from the heart) suf<U+FB01>ciently developed to close the canal
 of the vessel pretty completely, and to prevent much re<U+FB02>ux of blood into
 its undivided portion.
     14.  By this time the valvular function of the two lips of the opening into
 the ventricle has become abolished.
     15.  The valves are further developed by the hollowing out of the solid
 pyramid above and near the wall of the vessel, while they grow in other
 directions.
     16. The pocketing of each valve commences in each in the order of its
 appearance, and begins in the anterior and inner valves of each artery
 about the time that their bases have descended to the level of the bases of
 the ventricles, i.    e. at the 147th hour ofincubation, and is distinct in these
 valves at the        165th hour.    The pocketing of the outer valves is not
 distinct    till much later.     About the time that it commences, the valves

1868.]          Prof. W. Jones  on the propulsion    of Lymph  $0.          335
have assumed nearly their <U+FB01>nal positions with respect to the base of the
heart, and the aperture of communication between the arterial infundibula
is nearly closed up.
     17. After the complete separation of the aortic and pulmonary infun
dibula from each other, the further changes in the semilunar valves consist
principally in increase in size and diminution in thickness, so that they
 become more and more membranous,          part  passu, with the growth of the
 other parts of the heart.
    In  the description given above of the division of the truncus arteriosus,
it  has been shown that the aperture in the septum of the ventricles dues
 not close up entirely as is commonly supposed, but <U+FB01>nally developes into
 the aortic infundibula.
     The <U+FB01>fth vascular arch on each side gives off the branch to the lung
 of that side, and becomes ultimately the corresponding branch of the
 pulmonary artery, according to the view long ago propounded by Von
 Baer.

 from them during the preparation of this paper, which I here beg leave
 to acknowledge.        In particular Dr. Beale, who has given me much
 valuable advice throughout; the Rev. George Kempson and my cousin
 Mr. Charles Paddison, who sent me abundant supplies of fresh eggs; and

                                   (Abstract.)
     An anaemic frog, killed, as regards sensation and voluntary motion,
  without stoppage of the circulation, by plunging into water at 110° or
  120° Fahr., was laid open, and the posterior part of the anterior lymphatic
  heart of one side, in the niche behind and below the extremity of the large
  transverse process of the third vertebra, brought into view. By the removal
  of the skin of the back from over the scapular region, the part of the heart
  mentioned admitted of examination by transmitted light under a simple
  microscope—the lens é-inch focus.       It was seen that when the lymphatic
  heart contracted, a stream of lymph    was  propelled from it into a vein at its
  posterior border, and swept before
                                        it the blood in that vessel, whilst the
  <U+FB02>ow from behind was arrested.         As soon, however, as diastole of the
  lymphatic heart supervened, the <U+FB02>ow of blood from behind became re

   established, and drove the lymph onward in its turn.       Systole of the heart
   now again ensuing, the lymph-stream propelled into the vein swept forward
   the blood in that vessel as before, whilst the <U+FB02>ow of blood from         behind
   was arrested;    and so the same series of phenomena was repeated.
      It  was thus seen that the phenomena attending the propulsion of lymph
   from the anterior lymphatic hearts of the frog into the veins at their
   posterior border, with which they communicate by a valvular opening, are
   essentially similar to those attending the propulsion of the lymph from the
   caudal heart of the eel into the caudal vein.
      The vein at the posterior border of the heart, after receiving the lymph,
   turned behind the large transverse process of the third vertebra, and passed
  forwards along the inner to the anterior border of the heart, where it inos
  culated with the large blackish vein which runs up on the side of the neck.
      This large blackish vein was described by Professor Johannes Muller as
  issuing    from the heart; but the author     has not found it to do so.    It is
  merely in close connexion, so that it is dragged backwards by communica
  tion of the movement of the heart in contracting, and recoils forwards into
  its previous position when diastole takes place.

          M.A.     Received March 26, 1868.
                                       (Abstract)
       The authors have examined       a number   of mixtures of alcohol and water.
  They    show that     the speci<U+FB01>c heat of these mixtures, up to an alcoholic
  strength of about 36 per cent., is higher than the speci<U+FB01>c heat of water
  itself.
       Two methods were employed for estimating the speci<U+FB01>c heat exactly op
  posite in principle.
       The <U+FB01>rst consisted in heating a metallic weight to a certain temperature
  in a steam-oven, similar to that employed by Regnault in his researches,
   and then plunging it into the liquid the speci<U+FB01>c heat of which is to be
   estimated.     The rise in the temperature of equal quantities of different
   liquids produced by the introduction of the same weight, heated to the
   same temperature, is inversely proportional to the speci<U+FB01>c heat of such
   liquids.
       Two weights and several calorimeters of di<U+FB01>'erent sizes were used.        One
   of the weights was made of brass and weighed 246'49 grms., the other was
   of copper gilt weighing 614‘49 grms. Both weights were made in the form
   of stout rings, and in the inner cylindrical opening of each a small fan
   wheel was inserted.
       These rings, after being heated and let down into the calorimeter, were
   attached to a strand of worsted, and held freely suspended in the liquid of
   the calorimeter.      The worsted had previously been twisted, and when now
   allowed to untwist      it causes a rapid rotation of the ring.     The fan-wheel
-
   <U+FB01>xed inside    the  ring thereby produces    a  current, which, passing through
   the ring, not only serves to mix the liquid thoroughly, but also consider
   ably facilitates the rapid cooling of the weight.
       The calorimeters, as usual, consisted of cylindrical vessels made of very
   thin polished brass, supported on stretched silk cords, and surrounded by
    a double  cylinder of tin-plate to prevent,   as far as possible, any gain or loss
   by radiation.
       The temperature of the liquid was taken by a small thermometer, having
    a bulb  60 millims. long and about 2'5 millims. diameter.            Each degree
   was divided into twenty parts, and by means of a telescope Flo of a degree
   could be read OH.
       The authors give experiments which prove that the high speci<U+FB01>c heats
    observed   are not due to evaporation caused by the introduction of the
    heated metals into the calorimeter.
       The second method used was that generally employed.                  A certain
    weight of the liquid, the speci<U+FB01>c heat of which is to be estimated, enclosed
    in a suitable   vessel, is heated and then plunged,       vessel and all, into   a

ture of the calorimeter will rise, owing to the introduction of the heated
liquid, and the elevations in temperature produced by different liquids

above the calculated     mean speci<U+FB01>c heat up       to an alcoholic      strength of

I. “ Researches on the Blood—On the Action of Nitrites on the
        Blood.”     By Aa'ruua GAMGEE, M.D., F.R.S.E., Assistant to
        the Professor of Medical Jurisprudence in the University of
        Edinburgh.       Communicated           by Prof. FRANKLAND, F.R.S.
        Received April 1, 1868.
                                     (Abstract)
    The paper commences with a statement of the facts with which we are
at present acquainted, relating to the nature and character of the blood
colouring-matter,    and its relation to gases.
    I. The action of nitrites in modifying the colour and spectrum of blood
is then described.     Under the in<U+FB02>uence of nitrites, arterial blood assumes
 a  chocolate  coloration.      Coincidently the bands of scarlet cruorine (or
oxidized    haemoglobin) become very faint, and an additional absorption
 band, occupying the same position as that of acid hmmatiu, appears.             The
 addition of ammonia to blood       in which nitrites have induced the charac
 teristic change of colour and spectrum, causes the red colour to return and
 gives rise to a new spectrum in which the normal blood-bands are again
 better de<U+FB01>ned, but accompanied by a faint and rather unde<U+FB01>ned absorption
 band in the orange.      It appears from the experiments of the author that
 the change in optical properties induced by ammonia is not due to any
 decomposing action exerted upon the body formed under the in<U+FB02>uence of
 nitrites; for on neutralizing the solution to which ammonia has been added,
 the original  spectrum is reproduced.         When sulphide of ammonium, or a
 reducing-solution   of iron  is added   to  a  blood solution which has been acted
 upon by nitrites, all effects of their action disappear, and the solution again
 possesses the spectrum of oxidized blood-colouring-matter,         although precau

tions have been taken to exclude   atmospheric air.   The continued action
of the reducing-solution then leads to the reduction of the blood-colouring
matter, which when shaken with air again yields the perfectly normal
spectrum of blood.   It would therefore appear that when nitrites act upon
the blood-colouring-matter  they do not decompose       nor thrust out orit,
remove the loose oxygen with which        combined.
                                                it   is
   II. The author then describes series of experiments instituted with the
                                        a
object of determining whether blood which has been acted upon by nitrites
has lost its power of combining with the atmospheric oxygen.    The appa
ratus and methods used are described, and       shown that the amount of
                                                          it   is
oxygen which nitrite-blood absorbs           is   much smaller than that absorbed by
normal blood.
  III.     In
           the next series of experiments the author made use of carbonic
oxide gas as   reagent to indicate whether after the action of nitrites the
                    a
loose oxygen of the colouring-matter     still capable of expulsion
                                                  is                    CO.               by
With    this object the blood was arterialized by agitation with air and treated
with   a solution of   nitrite. After some time
                        a                              was brought in contact
                                                                    it
with   a measured volume of pure carbonic oxide; after being well agitated
and allowed to remain         in contact with        it   for    some    time, the gas was re
moved and analyzed.       It was found in these experiments that, after the
action of nitrites, the loose oxygen of the blood-colouring-matter  (which
the observations mentioned under      had been shown to be neither expelled
                                           I.
nor taken possession of by the nitrite) was so locked up as to be irre
moveable by carbonic oxide.
  IV. The methods which have been employed by other observers for re
moving the gases from the blood are then examined, and the author de
scribes the way in which he employed Sprengel’s mercurial aspirator to
effect the object whichhe had in view. He shows that with this instru
ment and following his method, the gases of the blood may be separated by
boiling in vacuo during twenty-<U+FB01>ve or thirty minutes.
  The      gases    of both normal    blood and blood               treated with nitrites      were
boiled out in vacuo, their amount estimated, and their composition deter
mined.    It shown that when blood has been acted upon
                   is                                          nitrite, the     bya
amount‘of oxygen which can            be removed          by ebullition in      a    very perfect
vacuuin     is   immensely   diminished,    the greatest difference
                                                              being perceived
when the nitrite hadbeen         in contact with the blood during the longest
period of time.
  V.. Although     blood which has been acted upon by nitrites has, to                           a
great extent, lost its power'of absorbing oxygen, still retains the property
                                                                it
which normal blood possesses of ozonizing the atmospheric oxygen.        Ni
trite-blood reacts with guaiacum paper exactly like normal blood, and when
added to solution of peroxide of hydrogen,
            a                                 causes an evolution of oxygen.

    VI. The changes in the optical properties of blood are shown to be due
to the formation of compounds of the nitrite used with oxidized haemo
globin ;  these compounds, with the exception of that with nitrite of silver,

present the same crystalline form, colour, and spectrum, whatever the nitrite
which has been employed.      The author has obtained compounds of haemo
globin with nitrite of sodium, potassium and silver, and with nitrite of' amyl.
The methods of preparing them are described, and the results of analysis
given ; these show that the amount of a nitrite which adds itself to oxidized
haemoglobin varies considerably.
  Having stated the conclusions    which he thinks may legitimately be
drawn from his investigations, the author concludes by making some obser
vations upon the relation which the compounds of nitrites with haemoglobin
bear to the previously known haemoglobin compounds.
  \Ve have hitherto been acquainted with haemoglobin                       itself, as well as
with its 0, CO, and Na 02 compounds.
   These compounds are all isomorphous, and possess almost the same
physical characters; in each of them haemoglobin free from oxygen           0.                ('1'.
reduced haemoglobin) has apparently linked to         molecule of O, CO, or
                                                                    it a
N2     respectively, the stability of the compound being least
         02                                                        the case of in
the O, and greatest in that of the N2 02 compound.      All these bodies, and
preeminently the       compound, are examples of
                               0                       class of bodies which
                                                                       a
stand, as     were, on the boundary line which separates chemical from

physical combination, being examples of the class to which the term
lecular compounds
                     ” has been given. Like other molecular compounds, their
composition varies extraordinarily within certain limits, and       in<U+FB02>uenced  is
by circumstances and conditions which have no action on chemical com
pounds proper.
     That  body possessing such
              a                   very complicated molecular structure as
                                                 a
haemoglobin should present numerous points of attachment, as     were, for         it
the linking on of such active condensed bodies as the nitrites not impro       is
bable; nor        is     it   remarkable           of other combinations
                                            that, as in the case               of             “
a  molecular kind,” such as the union of salts with their water of crystalliza
tion, of sugar with bases, of albumen with metallic oxides, of the com
pound ammonias with iodine, the amount of the new and more simple
body added to the haemoglobin should vary within wide limits.
   Simultaneously with the researches which the author has conducted on
the action of nitrites on blood, those now being made by Hoppc Seyler *
and Preyer     although discrepant in many particulars, seem to show that
                   1',
hydrocyanic acid possesses, like nitrites, the power of linking itself to oxi—
dized haemoglobin, forming         body whicha    isomorphous  iswith        but        it,
possessing    different
                  a      absorption spectrum,   and   incapable  of absorbing
oxygen.
    This body appears not to possess the power of ozonizing the atmospheric
oxygen,    fact which
              a         strange, as, besides being possessed
                                    is                          the   com    by         0

     This is  Part I., of  a series of three, of a paper on the microscopical
 characters of rhythmically contractile     muscular tissue, other than that of
 the bloodheart.       It comprises a reexamination of the microscopical cha
 racters of the rhythmically contractile muscular coat of the veins of the bat’s
 wing, and is offered by the author     as Appendix No. 3 to his paper in the
 Philosophical Transactions for 1852, entitled “ Discovery that the veins of
 the Bat’s Wing (which are furnished with valves) are endowed with rhyth
 mical contractility, and that the onward <U+FB02>ow of the blood is accelerated
 by each contraction.”         This reexamination supplies additional details,
 illustrated by more correct <U+FB01>gures, con<U+FB01>rmatory of the author’s previous
  description of the microscopical characters of the muscular coat of the
 veins of the bat’s wing.      The author examines also, by way of comparison,
 the tonically contractile muscular coat of the arteries, and points out that,
  though the <U+FB01>brils of the muscular coat of the veins do not present trans
 verse markings, they di<U+FB01>'er in their microscopical characters as much from
  the <U+FB01>brils of the muscular coat of the arteries, as the transversely striped
  muscular <U+FB01>brils of the bat’s heart do from them.         He insists, therefore,
  in conclusion, that there are no grounds for an implied physiological form
  of the doctrine of isomerism, viz. similarity of structure, with different
  endowments.

      The author, in this second part of his paper, <U+FB01>rst calls attention to the
   fact that, on viewing the anterior lymphatic heart from the front, after
   dissecting down upon it from the back, he sometimes found its cavity
   <U+FB01>lled with air or blood.    The way by which the air or blood had entered

186 8.]           Prof. W. Jones   on the Cauclal    Heart of      the   Eel.        343
he considers   to have been through the lymph-spaces opened into in the
course of the dissection ; and the mode of entrance he considers to have been
by suction during diastole of the heart. The sucking action, by which                the
heart thus draws air or blood into its cavity when the lymph-spaces are              cut
into, must operate, according to his view, as a means of promoting                   the
<U+FB02>ow of lymph in the natural state. After describing the mechanism                     of
the process, the author examines the microscopical characters of the proper
muscular tissue composing the wall of the lymphatic heart.    The result of
his observations on this point     is,
                                 that the muscular tissue of the lymphatic
hearts of the frog   similar to that of the veins of the bat’s wing, as regards
                      is
both its granular semitransparent aspect and the breadth of its <U+FB01>brillations,
whilst   differs from the muscular tissue of the blood-heart of the animal
         it
in being destitute of transverse markings.

       tractile Muscular Coat of the Caudal Heart of the Eel.”                      Re
       ceived    April 21, 1868.
  The caudal heart of the eel lies in kind of framework on the abdominal
                                         a
aspect of the extreme end of the vertebral column.   The body of the last
caudal vertebra forms the dorsal side of this framework, and     ridge of       a
bone, extending along its concave abdominal aspect, must project into the
caudal heart, partially dividing  into right and left compartments.
                                    it                                The
caudal heart of the eel would thus appear to represent the two caudal
sinuses of certain other <U+FB01>shes run into one.
   From the manner in which the caudal heart          connected with the sur
                                                      is
rounding  structures of the tail, its movements    are  communicated to them
as described in the author’s paper, entitled       “ The Caudal Heart of the
Eel, a Lymphatic Heart,” &c.        By the elastic recoil of the structures, on
the other hand, the cavity of the heart      drawn into
                                             is             state of dilatation

and the result must be, as in the analogous case of the anterior lymphatic
hearts of the frog, that lymph will be forced into the heart from the
adjacent lymphatic vessels or spaces.
  The muscular <U+FB01>bres composing the walls of the caudal heart resemble
in shape the sheathed primitive fasciculi of the muscles of the skeleton,
but are only half as broad, and they are not transversely striped.          They
have granular aspect, and on close examination are found to be afasciculus

of the bat’s wing, and of the muscular coat of the lymphatic hearts of the
frog, and may be grouped, the author thinks, together with them under                 a
common head, viz. unstriped rhythmically contractile muscular <U+FB01>brils.

     (1) Object of this Paper.—It has long been known that in an uniform
 canal <U+FB01>lled with liquid, the speed of advance of a wave in which the horizontal
 component of the disturbance is uniform from surface to bottom is equalto
 the velocity acquired by a heavy body in falling through half the depth of
,the canal.      But, so far as    I know, it has not hitherto been pointed out
 that a similar law exists for waves transmitting a disturbance of any possible
 kind in     a liquid of limited or unlimited depth, provided only that the
 upper surface of the liquid is a surface of uniform pressure.                   The object

      (2) Velocity of Advance de<U+FB01>ned.——Throughout this investigation the ve
 locity of advance of a wave will be de<U+FB01>ned to be the mean between the velo
 cities with which the shape of the wave advances relatively to a surface
 particle    at the crest, and to a surface-particle in the trough respectively.
  In   ordinary rolling waves the velocities of particles in those two positions
  are equal and contrary, so that the speed of advance as above de<U+FB01>ned is
  equal to the speed of advance of the wave relatively to the earth.                   A wave
 of translation in which the velocities of particles at the crest and hollow
 are not equal and contrary, may be regarded as produced by compounding
  the motion of a rolling wave with that of a current whose velocity is                   half
  the difference of the velocities of those particles.
     (3) Relation between height of wave and horizontal disturbance at the sur
face—The followingrelation between the height of a wave and the horizontal
  disturbance     of the surface-particles has already been proved and made use of
  by   various  authors   ; and it is demonstrated here for convenience only.             Let
   + 141 and   —-ul be  the velocities of a surface-particle   at the   crest and    trough of
  a wave respectively.       Let a  be the  velocity of advance    of   the  wave as de<U+FB01>ned
  in article 2.     Conceive a horizontal      current with the uniform          velocity -—a
  to be combined with the actual wave-motion            ;  the resultant      motion is that
  of an undulating current, presenting stationary          waves in its course; and the
  forces which act on the particles are not altered.           The resultant velocity of
  a particle at the    crest  becomes —a+ul; and the resultant velocity of a par
  ticle   in the trough becomes —a—u,.               Let the height from trough to
   crest be denoted by A: ; then, since the upper surface of the liquid is sup
   posed to be a surface of uniform pressure, the principle of the conservation
   of energy gives the following equation:
                        gAz=i{(a+1¢l)2_(a—ul)2}=2aul.                 .    .   .    .   -

      (4) Virtual Depth of Uniform Horizontal Disturbance—By                      the phrase
   “virtual depth of uniform horizontal disturbance," or, for brevity’s sake,
   virtual depth, I propose to denote the depth in the liquid to which an 1mi

    form horizontal   disturbance would have to extend, in order to make the
     amount of horizontal   disturbance equal to the actual amount.     That is to
    say, conceive that a pair of vertical planes normal to the direction of ad
    vance, and each of the breadth unity, coincide at a given instant, one with
    the trough-line or furrow, and the other with the crest-line or ridge, which
    bound one of the slopes of a wave.     We will suppose this to be the front
    slope, merely to <U+FB01>x the ideas; for similar reasoning applied to the back
     slope leads to the same results. At a given depth below the surface, let  :

wave must sweep in the same interval of time through an equal volume.

the virtual depth will continually adjust itself to the changing velocity, and

     If we   look on a map of the Australian continent published ten years
 ago,   we   are  struck by the immense expanse of land then unexplored; we
 perceive at a glance that the south-eastern sea-board only of this great
 continent had then been examined with any degree of accuracy, and that
 very little was known to us respecting the character of its shores on the
 west and north-west.         In two quarters only had the zeal and daring of the
 explorer     succeeded  in  forcing a path towards the central portions of this
 vast territory, Sturt having penetrated as far as 24° South and 138° East,
 and Gregory as far as 21° South and 128° East.                 The nature of the coun
 try traversed by these two eminent explorers was such as to countenance
 the supposition, that the interior of Australia was little better than one vast
 desert, offering almost insurmountable obstacles to exploration.                 The idea,
  originally advanced by Oxley, that the greater part of the interior was
 occupied by vast inland lakes, was then abandoned; and the theory just
  mentioned took its place.         In such a state of utter uncertainty as to the
 nature of the interior of a vast continent, it is but natural that various
 theories should be started       ; and no doubt they will, in the end, help to keep
  up the spirit for rigorous examination and exploration, yet care must be
  taken that they do not, by the unfavourable nature of their suppositions,
  tend to discourage enterprise.        From such a danger we had a narrow escape

  tects on the 4th of April 1868.

    during the years following A. C. Gregory’s exploration of the interior, and
    his expedition in search ofDr. Leichhardt, as at that time it was generally
    believed that the arid plains and stony deserts met with in the east and
    south, and the sandy desert in the north-west, were but the outskirts of
    a desert country unparalleled on our globe.
       Fortunately, however, for the progress of civilization and geographical
    knowledge, this unfavourable opinion as to the nature of the interior was
   not universally  entertained.    Many men, well versed in terrestrial physics,
   especially with reference to the Australian continent, could not, from rea
   sons based upon meteorological observations made in the south-east, concur
   in the prevailing belief.   They urged the possibility of tracts of <U+FB01>ne coun
   try interspersing the so-called desert, and the necessity, in any case, of
   clearing up the mystery still surrounding         this important geographical
   question;   and in thisjview  they were   strongly supported by the improba
  bility (generally speaking) of the existence 'of a desert country of such
  enormous extent and such a description in any part of the earth’s surface. It
  would be useless to enter now upon the arguments for and against the various
  opinions set forth during that period of uncertainty, except that they might
  in some instances serve to put us on our guard against advancing or accepting
  bold conjectureswhich may be put forward at any future time, and more par
  ticularly in the special case we have to deal with in this paper.     Su<U+FB01>-ice it
  to say, that the spirit of enterprise and the desire of increasing our geogra
  phical knowledge triumphed at last.        The year 1860 gave a fresh impulse
 to Australian exploration,    and  will for  ever be memorable as having inau
 gurated a new era in this respect.       In the end of that year and the begin
 ning of 1861, Burke and Wills crossed the continent with comparative
 case.     It was now said by many of the adherents of the old desert doctrine,
 that Burke had merely hit upon a narrow strip of good country, which
 carried him across; had he but deviated to the one side or the other of
 his path he must have failed in his attempt.        But when M‘Dougal Stuart
 three times crossed and recrossed the continent in other parts, and the last
 time from     shore to shore—when       M‘Kinlay made his way from South
 Australia, by way     of  the  Gulf  of Carpentaria, to the coast of Queens
land, driving before him a <U+FB02>ock of sheep—when Walker and Landsborough
had accomplished their journeys through the imaginary desert country—
the old opinion could no longer be maintained, and the desert theory fell
utterly into discredit, at least as far as the eastern part of the continent is
concerned.     Since that time this once so much dreaded task has been several
times successfully accomplished, so that we are now enabled to give a pretty
accurate description of the features of the country forming the scene of
these glorious achievements ; and as it will doubtless prove of material
assistance to the complete understanding of the following exposition and
plan,    I may here be permitted to give in a few words an outline of the
main character of the ground to the north of the parallel of latitude 26°,
between the coast-ranges of Queensland and Stuart’s route through the

centre, which    embraces nearly    the whole   of the country discovered and
examined since 1860.
   From the records of the various explorers, it would appear that the line
which divides the waters <U+FB02>owing to the coast, and those flowing to the in
terior, runs from 1%" S. on Stuart’s track to 19° S. latitude on Lands
borough’s    south-west expedition, in 138° east longitude.   According to
Mr. M‘Intyre’s            reliable observations, this line would then pass
                  apparently
through 22° S. in 141%o E., whilst M‘Kinlay places in the same locality
the watershed between the Middleton and Miiller rivers, in a latitude but
slightly di<U+FB01>'ering from that just named; and in Walker's Diary we <U+FB01>nd it
passing through 21%o S. and 145° E., where I <U+FB01>nd the highest elevation
recorded by the latter explorer on his expedition in search of Burke and
Wills. Mr. A. C. Gregory’s exploration places the continuation of this
line of watershed through the north-west in 13° S. and 130° E., whilst in
the east it meets the main watershed between the Belyando and Thomson
on the one side, and the Burdekin and Flinders on the other, in about 21°
S. and l45§° E.      (See accompanying map.)      The sweep of this line leads
across a sandstone tableland of considerable elevation—in parts even as
high, if we may rely on the data hitherto collected respecting     it,as 1900
or 2000 feet.    On its coast side this tableland inclines somewhat abruptly,
 whilst towards the interior   itslopes more gently, thus affording      ready
                                                                         a
 explanation of the marked difference existing between its river-systems,
 those <U+FB02>owing in the former direction passing through well-de<U+FB01>ned valleys,
while those in the latter direction run generally in shallow beds, and are
consequently subject to excessive evaporation and inundation according to
the season of the year.  The general incline of the country from longitude
145° to Stuart’s track in about 135°     towards south-west, until reaching
                                          is
near the latter its lowest point, as we feel justi<U+FB01>ed in concluding from the
great number of hot springs on the route Stuart pursued when crossing the
continent.   This immense tract of land abounds in creeks and ill-de<U+FB01>ned
water-courses.   In many cases the dividing or separating ridges of sand
stone are (probably from the effects of <U+FB02>oods and weather) broken up, and
cover the surface, which then presents    desert-like appearance, only here
                                           a
and there covered with    ascanty vegetation, consisting mostly of Spinifex
(Triodz'a irritans).  Very frequently, however, these ridges have succeeded
in resisting the destroying effects, and we then meet with valleys of good
soil, covered with <U+FB01>ne grass and gum forest; which state of things, hap
pily for the future of the Australian continent, seems to predominate, as
we learn from the reports of explorers who passed through <U+FB01>ne country
after having once entered the tropic.    These water-courses of the interior
basin drain partly towards the Barcoo River (Cooper’s Creek), partly to
wards the south, splitting up into innumerable little creeks and rills with
out any de<U+FB01>nite direction.    As an example of the latter kind may be men
tioned the Burke Creek, which at times causes immense inundations in the
tract of country near 25°      and 140° E., as we learn from the reports of
                               S.

manner indicated on our map ; and it certainly bears every appearance as if
this region of sandstone was principally caused by the effects of the inun
dations and <U+FB02>oods already referred to. For whereas it is very easy to trace
this peculiar phenomenon to the south, it is hardly possible to de<U+FB01>ne it
exactly towards the north, which fact accords well with the explanation of
its true origin just suggested. The careful researches of Mr. B. Hassen
stein* have tended to throw new light upon this subject, and reduce the
Stony Desert to its proper limits. \Ve know now that the arid plains de
scribed by some explorers, which others had found well grassed and covered
with an even luxuriant vegetation, are the receptacles of the waters <U+FB02>owing
from the north, and form       the boundary      of the Stony Desert;       we   know
moreover that extensive tracts of <U+FB01>ne country         are interspersed with strips
of “stony desert” of a very limited extent.           Such is the nature of the
whole country, as far as we know      from the meridian of 145° to Burke’s

be mostly of the some description as that already well known to us, as              it
forms only the lower part of the interior basin above described, the very
bottom of which we have been made tolerably well acquainted with by
Stuart’s exploration, which bears out that supposition.   Further to the
west, in the unknown  country between Stuart's track and the west coast,
the same sandstone tableland probably rises again to the high ranges which
have been observed by the various explorers who have penetrated into the
interior from the west, attaining in some parts an elevation of from three
to four thousand feet above the ocean.   Therefore        not at all unlikely
                                                             it   is
that we shall <U+FB01>nd in the western half of the central basin in the main the
same state of things which we have found to exist in the east, with but such
slight modi<U+FB01>cations as may be determined by the con<U+FB01>guration and lay of
the country in connexion with the prevailing system of winds and contin
gent meteorological phenomena.
   In order to complete the general description of this portion of the Au

pical sun must naturally exert upon     a    territory constituted as this interior
tableland.  During the time the sun         isnorth of the equator, in the winter
months of the southern hemisphere, the prevailing winds are from south
east all over the northern continent, with little and only occasional rain          ;
but on the sun’s approach,      during October      and November,       the monsoon
shifts to north-west, and brings on the rainy season, gradually advancing
from south to north in the middle of December and January.     At the end
of this season, in February and March, and about the time preceding the
shifting back to south-east of the monsoon in April, the heavy falls of rain
and thc soaked state of the soil cause these immense <U+FB02>oods which are

recorded      in the Journals of the various explorers; and it is during this
period that in the territory south of the Burke Creek and north of the
Stony Desert, as we have already explained, great ravages are caused by
inundation. Further to the south the meteorological phenomena of the
northern portion of the continent pass gradually over to those prevailing
in the south, namely that of two alternating currents of air, with winter
rains and a short rainy season in September and October.
     Great as have been the recent achievements with regard to the geogra
phical knowledge of the continent, comparatively little has been done by
any one of the exploring expeditions towards the advancement of science.
 Information calculated to throw light on the elevation of the interior or on
its geological character <U+FB02>ews very scantily from the journals kept by the
 explorers; and even the astronomical determinations of localities must, at
 least as far as longitude is concerned, be received with caution, as the means
 at their disposal, the comparatively small practice of most of the observers
 in determinations of this kind, and the very methods employed, would hardly
 admit of anything like a close approximation to the truth.           Indeed we may
 safely assert that it would have been scarcely compatible with the general
 pioneering object of parties in the <U+FB01>eld since 1860 to have devoted more
 attention to matters of science, strictly speaking, than was suf<U+FB01>cient to
 carry them through the dif<U+FB01>culties they had to encounter.            Perhaps it may
                                       I
 not be considered out of place if express here my deep regret, on this very
 ground, for the untimely death of my young friend, W.             J.  Wills, the as-  .
 tronomer of Burke’s expedition; for, bad he but survived his <U+FB01>rst feat,
  there can be but little doubt that his zeal for the advancement of science,
  and the knowledge he had obtained during the time he was on the stat? of
  the Observatory over which      I  then presided, would have enabled him to
  take the <U+FB01>rst place as a scienti<U+FB01>c explorer, whereas we can now only admire
  him for his courageous and enterprising spirit as a pioneer.            This hope,
  however, is at an end     ; and up to the present time absolutely nothing has
  been done towards the scienti<U+FB01>c examination        of the vast interior of Austra
  lia—an examination of such immense importance for the advancement of
  almost every branch of physical science, and for the development of the
  natural resources of this great country.     It is with regard to this matter that
  I venture to address this Society, with the view of soliciting its im
  portant assistance in starting an expedition, having for its object the ex
  ploring ot' the western half of Australia, and the scienti<U+FB01>c survey of the
  route across the entire continent.
      When the celebrated Australian explorer, Dr. Leiehhardt, started on the
  expedition which was to be his last, he did so with the intention of crossing
  the continent from east to west, for the purpose of discovering the extent
  of Sturt’s desert, and the character of' the western and north-western coas ,
  and of observing the gradual change in vegetable and animal life from
  one side of the continent to the other“.         It is now exactly twenty years

 since this grand idea was conceived and attempted to be carried out.               The
last news of Dr. Leiehhardt is dated April the 3rd, 1848.              Subsequent to
 this date nothing has been heard of him ; and deep mystery still surrounds
his fate, notwithstanding the many efforts which have since been made,
originally to rescue the explorer and his party, and subsequently, when all
hope of again seeing any of them alive was abandoned, to ascertain the
manner in which they perished, and the locality where it occurred.                  No
doubt, to many it may have appeared premature on the part of Dr. Leieh
hardt to have entered upon such an undertaking at a time when so little
was known of the nature of the interior as to make it utterly impossible to
lay down a route across the continent on any other ground than that of
mere conjecture.       Circumstances, however, have since that time changed
considerably;     at least  one half of the continent has since been explored in
such a way as to make us acquainted with the natural resources an explorer
may expect to meet with and turn to account, whilst even from the western
coast numerous expeditions have tended to diminish the risk with which
such an undertaking would be invested.            And in directing the attention of
this Society to Dr. Leichhardt’s idea, with the view of seeing it carried out,
I  do so with the conviction that now the proper time has arrived for taking
in hand an enterprise of such importance for the future of the Australian
colonies, and especially for the advancement of science, and thereby mani
festing alike our appreciation of the various interests at stake, and of the
noble mind who risked all he had in their furtherance.              In the execution
of such     a work, its scope may now       be materially  extended.    Instead    of  a
rough survey on a single line from north-east to south-west, with an appa
ratus which allowed of' but a limited attention being paid to strictly scien
ti<U+FB01>c matters, it is now proposed to form a base-line for the various branches
of science through the interior of a vast continent.         That such a work can
now no longer be regarded as impracticable or premature, and that its suc—
cessful completion cannot be otherwise than replete with the greatest inte
rest,   I hope to be able to show in the course of this paper.
    After these introductory remarks, I shall proceed to detail the plan
which I propose to follow in carrying out the exploration of the western
half of the continent, and the scienti<U+FB01>c survey of the line of route to he
followed in traversing the interior from the east shores of Queensland to
Western Australia.
    It is proposed that the expedition be organized in Queensland, probably
on the Burdekin, near Port Denison, in 20° south latitude.             From a point
in 20° South and about l48° East it will strike out for apoint in 9.4—}o
South on Stuart’s       track.    So far the interior has to some extent been
explored already, and it can be predicted with some degree of certainty,
with what dif<U+FB01>culties and with what facilities the expedition will probably
meet*.       From this point, which       I  designate on the accompanying map
by   the  letter B, the  original  starting-point being A, to the south-western

extremity of the continent, nothing is known; and in choosing a prac
ticable route, we must be guided entirely by surmises as to the nature
of the country, based upon the supposition that we shall most probably
have to deal with a state of things in the west very similar to that already
known to exist in the cast.     Ishall, in the <U+FB01>rst place, however, lay down
the entire course, and then enter upon       my reasons for having done so.
From point B I propose keeping nearly on the same parallel as far as
point C, in longitude 125%" East; from thence proceeding on the same
meridian to a point in 27° South, and thence to a point D in 116—}0 East
and 31; South.        Near the latter point, on our route to Perth in Western
Australia, we shall strike the Swan River. The entire distance on that
route is about 2649 miles, of which 1080 comprise the distance from
A to B, and the remainder that from B to C and I), an allowance of
20 per cent. being made for curvature, which percentage must always be
understood when reference to distance occurs in the course of this paper.
    As a close examination of the country traversed is the primary object of
the expedition, it is proposed to accomplish it in thirteen stages, so that
fourteen separate depots will have to be established during its progress,
each depot being intended to be retained only for such a time as will he
requisite for the survey and exploration of the surrounding country, and
for the formation and transport to the next.       From A to B the number of
depots   will be six, so that  the  average  distance between two consecutive
depots will be 216 miles, while from B to C and C toD there will be eight
depots, with an average distance of 200 miles.        On the map these depots
are marked; but it is evident that it is next to impossible to assign them
their proper positions with any degree of accuracy, as these will depend so
much upon circumstances at present almost entirely unknown to us.           It is
only for the line from A to B that we are enabled to <U+FB01>x with any certainty
the positions of such depots, as we are already acquainted with some loca
lities the nature of which will probably recommend them for such a pur
pose.    Thus we should propose <U+FB01>xing depot No. 2 on the meridian of 145°
and near Walker’s track, depot No. 3 on the Middleton River of M‘Kinlay,
depot N0. 4 near the
                         “ <U+FB01>ne open plains ” of Burke and Wills, and depot
No. 6 on Stuart’s track somewhere between the Fincke and Hugh rivers,
in each of which cases the country is described as well grassed and provided
with permanent water. For depot N0. 6, and depots 7 to 12, we have no
data whereby to guide us, until we again approach the regions already ex
plored from the west.      As it is proposed from these various depots to strike
out in ditferent directions, they will have also to be selected with a view to
enable these‘minor expeditions to yield the greatest possible amount of in
formation with respect to the largest possible tracts of country.
  With   reference to the time required for accomplishing the whole expe
dition in a manner commensurate with the scienti<U+FB01>c objects of the under
taking, it may be said, that it is proposed to devote three years and six
months to    of which <U+FB01>fteen months are taken up by the examination of
           it,

354                      Dr. Neumayer       on a Scienti<U+FB01>c               [May 14
the country between A and B, and twenty-seven months for the exploration
and scienti<U+FB01>c survey of that part of the route within the entirely unknown
region between points B and D.            Now let us examine what prospects of
success this would      allow for the performance of the task proposed.        The
distance from the Burdekin to Stuart’s track may easily he travelled through,
at the moderate rate of ten miles a day, in 108 days, or three months and
a half, allowing a time of stay in each of the several depots of nearly two
months (1'9).        For the route through the western country, the time has
been increased at a rate proportionate to the increased risk incurred and
the care to be bestowed upon the explorations within its regions.         The time
requisite to travel over the line from B to D would be about <U+FB01>ve months
and a half, which would allow of a period of stay in each of the depots of
 2'4 months; counting, however, depot No. 6 twice, as it is proposed, for
reasons presently to be explained, to prolong the stay at that point beyond
the time generally allowed to the other depots.          From this exposition, it is
evident that ample opportunities are offered for an exact study of the ground
travelled over with reference to the various branches of science to be in
 cluded in the scope of the entire work.         This will become still more appa
 rent on the further unfolding of the details of the organization of the expe
 dition. Dr. Leichhardt intended to travel over nearly the same distance
 in about two years and a half, and that too without having also, as regards
 the eastern portion of the Continent, any information whatever to guide him
in his route; and it was probably to some extent owing to the insuf<U+FB01>ciency
of time allowed by him for the carrying through of such an extensive un
 dertaking, and the consequent de<U+FB01>ciency of provisions and out<U+FB01>t, that he
 failed in its accomplishment.      The extent, moreover, of the scienti<U+FB01>c labours
preposed      to be undertaken   on   this occasion is something widely different
 from what explorers twenty years ago could attempt, and is such as would
 of itself alone justify an increase of time by twelve months.
     I shall now have to enumerate a few of the reasons prompting me in
 proposing the route I have laid down in the preceding pages.           From what
 I have already said respecting the character of the tropical and subtropical
 interior of Australia, it appears that the line of route from the Burdekin
 to the Fiucke of Stuart passes, as far as known, through practicable coun
 try, well watered uud grassed, abounding in game of all kinds, and likewise
 well peopled with aboriginals.         We are on this route likely to meet with
 the most practicable country        in  the interior we propose to explore and
 examine, and shall probably shun entirely the so-called desert country, sub
ject to destructive inundations.        There is much likelihood that the unknown
 regions   in  the west bear in many    respects a great resemblance to the eastern
 half; and I therefore feel inclined to believe that on the same parallel of
 latitude (23° S.) we shall meet with no greater obstacles to progress than
 we are likely to encounter in the east.         The explorations of Mr. Gregory
 in the same latitude and in longitude l17° seem to corroborate this opinion,
 as the country appeared to him from that point towards the east to bear

  for many miles a promising appearance.              Observations made in other parts
  of the north-west littorale of Australia con<U+FB01>rm this view, and some of the
  rivers have been supposed to take their origin in high granite and trap
  ranges three hundred miles from the coast.              They would in this case be
  only four hundred miles from our point C, towards which the high western
  tableland, of which these ranges are probably the watershed, inclines until
  again reaching the lowest part near Stuart’s hot springs and the lake district
  forming the receptacle of the drainage from the Barcoo River.              The course
  proposed passes very nearly through the centre of the unknown interior, and
  offers therefore, as an inspection of the map will show, an opportunity for
  exploring these unknown regions, and most likely also for tracing the limits
  of Mr. Gregory’s sandy deserts in the north-west.              With  reference to the
  south-west extremity,       I accept  for the greater part the suppositions thrown
  out by the Rev.     J.  E. T.  Woods respecting its nature, <U+FB01>rst ably set forth in
  a letter addressed to the ‘ Melbourne

  peated in his excellent work on Australian exploration (vol. ii. p. 511), from
  which we quote the following passage. Mr. Woods says,—“ If the western
  end of the tableland be on an average two thousand feet high, there must be a
  drainage to the interior nearly equal to that which causes so many rivers on
  the west coast.      The watershed has never yet been crossed from the west
  side; but one cannot help remarking that wherever it has been crossed
  elsewhere good land has been found.           It is no evidence against the existence
  of a river that none are found on the south coast, especially in the Austra
 lian Bight, where it would be most likely to appear.              Many places in the
 interior have an extensive drainage, which never reaches the sea. The
  Barcoo drains into Lake Eyre, which is the receptacle of many other streams.
  A stream from the west coast might empty itself into Lake Gairdner‘l’. There
 must at any rate be some important drainage in connexion with that large
  sheet of water.”       It is scarcely needful to add anything to the reasons here
 set forth for the necessity of the existence of a large drainage area in the
 south-western extremity of the continent ; but it may perhaps be not out
 of place to recall to mind here that the Barcoo River (Cooper’s Creek)
 drains a territory of nearly nine degrees of longitude and seven degrees of
 latitude before emptying itself into Lakes Eyre and Gregory, forming, after
 its bifurcation near the locality where the <U+FB01>nal scenes of the Burke and
 Wills tragedy were enacted, an immense river delta, far exceeding any of
 the well-known deltas in the worldi'.           .[f we now place a drainage system,
 in dimensions similar to that just spoken of, to the west of Lakes Eyre
 and Gairdner, it would in all probability be intersected by the course
 proposed through the western interior.            An expedition, after having once
 struck   such  a  river-system,   would   of course  have to follow up the discovery ;
 and would, in its further course towards south-west,              have mainly   to be
     I rather feel inclined to believo that the receptacle spoken of is formed by some
       I
lakes to the north of the Australian Bight, yet undiscovered.

guided by the watercourses, without however losing sight of its primary
object.     It is not unlikely that, by the time the proposed expedition would
reach the country north of the Australian Bight, expeditions from Western
Australia, and even from the recently opened harbour on the south coast
(Eucla), will have thrown new light upon this subject, thereby considerably
facilitating this portion of the undertaking.
    It has already been mentioned that at point B on Stuart’s track it is pro
posed to make a longer stay than in any of the other depots.                 The prin
cipal reason for so doing is to afford the expedition at that stage an oppor
tunity of communicating         with the settled portion of South Australia, pre
vious to entering on the unknown territory to the south-west.                  A small
party may be detached from the main body for the purpose of travelling to
the nearest point of settlement, on which occasion collections and documents
may be sent to Adelaide or Melbourne, as well as any information received
which may be of importance for the progress of the expedition, and chie<U+FB02>y
such respecting the progress of exploration in Australia, having an imme
diate bearing on the problem at issue.             Such an expedition may also pre
sent an opportunity of exchanging or making up our complement of men
and horses, replenishing stores, Sac. That this does not present any serious
dif<U+FB01>culty in execution we know from Stuart's expeditions, who on an ave
rage travelled the distance from the Fincke to Mount Margaret" (Mr.
Jarvis’s station) in twenty-four days. It is therefore fair to suppose that
within ten weeks this party could proceed to the <U+FB01>rst settlements and re
turn, after having accomplished its objects.
    In the preceding part of this paper I have laid down the track I propose
following, and have, I believe, succeeded in explaining the reasons which
guided me in doing so.          I have avoided, however, all matters of detail as
to the branch expeditions, which are intended to be undertaken on both
sides of the main route, as such expeditions must to a great extent depend
on the nature of the country to be explored, on which point our knowledge
is still very scanty.      I shall now in a few words give an outline of the
 scienti<U+FB01>c objects of the expedition, and then proceed with some details re
specting its organization      and probable expense.
    An   expedition passing through the centre of such a vast continent, tra
 velling through 32 degrees of longitude and 12 degrees of latitude, cannot
be otherwise considered than as productive of the most material advantages
to the cause of science generally, provided the plan of its working be such
as accords with the present state of scienti<U+FB01>c inquiry, and the conduct of
the whole be entrusted to competent hands. It is frequently supposed that,
in expeditions of this nature, it is expedient to con<U+FB01>ne the scienti<U+FB01>c rc
searches and observations within the narrowest limits.              Indeed, a rigorous
 scienti<U+FB01>c inquiry is frequently thoughtincompatible with geographical dis
 covery.     This is a grievous mistake, and has invariably proved to be such
 whenever an expedition has taken the <U+FB01>eld, in the organization of which

           Probably the stations are now still further advanced towards the north.

  proper attention had been paid to the objects it had to serve. There is no
  doubt that the many unemployed hours, even of those of the party gene
  rally and more exclusively engaged upon exploration matters, may, for the
  bene<U+FB01>t of the well-being of the whole expedition, well be turned to account
  in assisting scienti<U+FB01>c inquiry. On such principles the scienti<U+FB01>c plan of
  operations of the proposed expedition,             as detailed hereafter, has been
  framed.       It includes the following branches :—
      l. Astronomical Science and Surveging.—-In addition to such operations
  as are absolutely necessary for the mapping of the country, it is proposed
  to organize a system of observations of the moon, with a view to assist lon
  gitudinal determination.         Such more accurate determinations of the geo
 graphical       position    may be    carried   out  at  i
                                                            the  various     depots above
  spoken    of.
      2. Terrestrial Physics and Meteorologg.—Systematic registration of
 meteorological phenomena and terrestrial magnetism is likewise to be car
 ried out at the depots, particularly with a view to assist barometrical mea
  surements of elevations and magnetic observations in the <U+FB01>eld.
     If it should prove at all practicable, it would likewise be advisable to
 include in the general plan of working observations on the length of the
 pendulum vibrating seconds.
     3. Geology, Palwontologg, and .Mineralogg.—A geological sketch-map
 of the whole route across the continent is to be made, and palseontological
 specimens are to be collected.            Special attention    has to be paid      to the
 mineral resources of the country travelled over.
     4. Belong—Observations            on the physiology and geographical distri
 bution of plants are to be included, and collections made.
     5. Zoology and Comparative              Anatomy,    including Ethnology—This
 branch is likewise to be attended to with a view to assist physiological
 studies, and to examine into the applicability of Darwin’s Theory on the
 Fauna of Australia, ancient and modern.              Collections are to be made.
     Character      and   language  of  the aboriginals in the various parts of the
 continent are to be studied.
     6. Sketching and Photography—These arts will be employed more par
ticularly for the purpose of representing the character of the various tracts
of country passed through, but will have likewise to assist the various
branches of science in the complete execution of their parts.
     I refrain from entering into particulars respecting the general scheme of
scienti<U+FB01>c work to be adhered to in the course of the expedition ; the more
so as it is intended that the authorities in the various scienti<U+FB01>c branches,
both in England and in the colonies of Australia, should be consulted on
this matter, and their cooperation and advice solicited.              l t is especially by
the aid of the scienti<U+FB01>c men and institutions in Australia, and their exten—
sive labours in the various branches of science. that I am led to hope for a
great success in the scienti<U+FB01>c part of the work of the cXpeditiou, as these
labours form an excellent base whcrcon to build and start from.                      Thus
much,      however,     I  may state, that it is to be made a rule that nothing he
                                                                         2 r. 2

358                        Dr. Ncnmaycr   on a Scienti<U+FB01>c                [May   14-,
included     in the plan of immediate investigation while in the field which
may     well  be deferred without prejudieing the general objects of the expe
 dition.     This rule is to hold good for all scientific branches, and will also
 be made a guiding principle with reference to the reduction and discussion
 of observations, the examining of natural-history objects, and the collecting
 of specimens.
      At the present time, when mystery still surrounds the fate of Dr. Leich
 hardt,   I  should consider myself open to just reproach were    I to lay out the
  plan and scope of an expedition through the interior of Australia without
  calling attention to this subject, and including it among the duties of such
  an ellpedition to aid in clearing up that mystery.         As remarked at the
  outset of this paper, twenty years have    now   elapsed since the utter disap
  pearance of that great explorer, and there is now indeed scarcely any like
 lihood of rescuing any of his party alive. But the hope of even ascertain
  ing the fate of that brave body of men should never be abandoned until
  the object be attained, though there can be no doubt that the chances of
  our doing so grow smaller from year to year, every fresh inundation or
  con<U+FB02>agration of large tracts of forest diminishing them considerably.        The
  scienti<U+FB01>c survey entailed upon such an expedition as that proposed offers
  great facilities also for the promotion of a search after traces of the missing
  exPlorers.                           I
                 In addition to which consider it of extreme importance for
  such a purpose that the search should       be  instituted  in the direction   in
  which the missing eXpedition intended       to move, the more so as all efforts
  to cut Lcichhardt‘s probable route at right angles have hitherto proved
  ineffectual.    When we consider that the eastern portion of the Australian
  continent has been so frequently crossed and recrossed during the last six
 years without any material information having been gained as to Leich
  hardt’s fate, we feel almost disposed to believe that he shaped his course
  from Upper Victoria and the Alice River, in a direction somewhat similar
  to that taken by Mr. Gregory on his expedition in search of him, particu
  larly as such an opinion is supported by such an authority on Australian
   exploration as Mr.    J. E. T. Woods in his recent work. According to his
   Opinion the eXplorer was compelled to follow the Barcoo, and may have
   perished in the country to the west of Lake Eyre and Stuart's track.        But
   we must not forget that such a course to the south-west would, with this
 indefatigable eXplorer, have been equivalent to giving up his original plans
   respecting the exploration—plans which, as far as we are acquainted with
   them through the Rev. Mr. Clarke of Sydney, and others intimately con
   nected with him, would have carried him to the west, and even to the north
   of west. This opinion was also entertained by Mr. A. Gregory, who thought
   “that Leichhardt had left the Barcoo at its junction with the Alice, and,
  favoured     by thunderstorms, penetrated the level desert country to the
   north-west, where, being unable to return, they may have perished for
   want of water.”       (Expedition in Search of Dr. Leichhardt, 185 7—58,
    page 8.)    Such may be the case, but it may also be that they succeeded
   in forcing their way through the country referred to by Gregory, and there

fore the country between Stuart’s and Burke’s track must be well examined
with a view to <U+FB01>nd traces of the party. Although          may at <U+FB01>rst sight
                                                                       it;
appear  dif<U+FB01>cult to conceive that Stuart could have passed six times through
the country which Leichhardt most probably crossed on his way to the
west without observing any trail or mark of the latter’s course, neverthe
less there  no improbability in such being the case and unremitting zeal
                is                                                ;
should be displayed throughout the whole expedition in endeavouring to
liftthe veil from off this sad tragedy. Should the expedition fail in <U+FB01>nding
the remains of the party in the east, they will have to search for them in
the west and south—west  extremity of the continent.
     An
      expedition through the vast interior of Australia, with such an ex
tended scheme of operations and so many important matters to attend to,
should be organized on such     base as to give full guarantees for being able
                                      a
to accomplish its main objects, as well as to protect itself against attacks
of the aboriginals and the destructive effects of unforeseen misfortunes.   It
is therefore proposed that the expedition should number twenty-<U+FB01>ve men.
The following     the plan showing how the exploring expedition proper
                      is                                                                       is
to be composed :—
     Leader,      assistantleader, storekeepcr and overseer, saddler and tent
maker,         blacksmith and wheelwright,    twelve stoekmen, and three abo
riginals.        To these are to be added the following scienti<U+FB01>c men of the
party :—1 . Geologist            and mineralogist   ;     2. Botanist        and chief medical
of<U+FB01>cer; 3. Zoologist,         palaaontologist, and medical assistant    4. Artist,;
photographer,         and custos of collections  5. Assistant for physical science
                                                  ;
and observer.
       With
          reference to the organization           of the party,       so as to ensure   a   satis
factory cooperation of all concerned,         it    is   proposed to adhere to the follow
ing principles :—-'
      The scienti<U+FB01>c members of the expedition, with the exception of the
     l.
leader and the assistant leader, do not form part of the exploring party
proper, but are under the leader’s supervision, and may be employed as
may appear to him desirable for the advancement of the objects of the
                                     I
expedition.
   2. The exploring party proper consists of the leader as <U+FB01>rst officer, the
assistant leader second o<U+FB02>icer, and the overseer third of<U+FB01>cer, two artisans,
twelve stockmen, and three aboriginals.
  3. The exploring party proper       to be  is             divided    into three bodies of
men     :—
          a. Depot party.—Storekceper         and overseer, saddler and tent-maker,
                 three men, and an aboriginal.        To this party the assistant observer
                 is to be attached.
          6.   Field Par/y I.—Leader, blacksmith,            four men, and an aboriginal.
                 To this party any of the scienti<U+FB01>c men may be attached as best
                 answering the purpose, care being, however, taken that one of
                 the medical men be included among them.

360                         Dr. Ncunmycr        on a Scienti<U+FB01>c                     [May 14,
       0.  Field Party IL—Assistant           leader,   <U+FB01>ve    men, and an aboriginal.
              To this party &c.      as above.
   4. The depot party remains in the depots which will successively be
formed     in the course of the expedition.           It will chie<U+FB02>y be employed in
 keeping everything       in  repair  and  good   order,   in preparing provisions, and
propagating useful plants.           The sick and convalescent are likewise to be
received into it.        Systematic registration of meteorological and magnetical
phenomena        is to be  carried on by it under the immediate superintendence
of  the   assistant   observer.
    5. The <U+FB01>eld parties will be employed in such a manner that one will be
 examining the neighbourhood            of the depot, say thirty miles round, while
the other will undertake the larger excursions on both sides of the main
route.      In  case  of a removal    of the depot in the direction of the main route,
all parties will have       to   cooperate.    It is proposed, more0ver, to employ
the <U+FB01>eld telegraph, as well for the promotion of the scienti<U+FB01>c objects as for
the more satisfactory cooperation of the whole party engaged.                       The per
fection to which ballooning has been brought by the zeal and energy of
Mr. Glaisher makes it not unlikely that it may be employed with advantage
in  this eXpedition for the facilitation of the exploring and mapping                 of tracts
of country otherwise barely accessible.
   For means of transport it is proposed to employ <U+FB01>fty horses and eight or
ten camels, which latter animals have now been acclimatized in the colo
nies, and show a special          <U+FB01>tness and adaptation        for Australian exploring
work.
   We may now add a few words as to the probable amount of expenditure
an expedition of this kind would involve, referring, however, for particulars
to the appendix.
   The following is an abstract of the probable expense :4
]. Expenses previous to the organization of the expedition                      £880      0   0

This   estimate has been framed without regard to any expenses in connexion
with the publication of the results of the expedition.                    The sum may, at
<U+FB01>rst sight, appear somewhat large; but when we come to take into consi
deration the objects which the expedition professes to advance—when we
remember that, for the <U+FB01>rst time in the history of Australian exploration,
the various governments are to unite in support of a uniform and well
planned scheme of exploration—when we consider that this sum is to be
distributed over a period of three years and a half—we cannot fail to per
ceive the moderate amount of the sum proposed to be expended.
   It is proposed that the expenditure for this great scheme of eXploration
 of the vast interior of Australia, and the scienti<U+FB01>c researches contingent

 mittee to consist of not more than five members.        All funds would be
 placed at their disposal, and all money transactions in  connexion with the
 expedition          would be made under their supervision            and subject to their
 approval.
   The objects of the expedition having been attained, and the time arrived
 when the same     to be broken up, the residue of the stock and stores—
                        is
 horses, camels, equipment, instruments, provisions, &c.—would be handed
 over to the Committee of Trustees, to be disposed of as they might think <U+FB01>t.
    All observations, journals, maps, natural-history collections, drawings,
 and photographs, without exception, would likewise be handed over to the
 Committee of Trustees on the completion of the expedition, in order that
 the same may be turned to account in furtherance of the interests of science,
 and of the various countries that have taken   part in this great undertak
                                                         a

collections, and none of the results would be made public, unless     special        by
 authority of the Committee of Trustees.

a rising country—an attachment not unnatural, after                  a   connexion

mode of proceeding in its execution;            but none,         I   presume, will venture to
deny its importance, especially         with     regard        to    the      development of the
natural resources of that immense area, in the interests of civilization—
none,  I feel sure, will oppose it as being premature or inopportune.                            It
would be presumptuous on my part were I to urge the importance of the
opening up of the western interior for the successful settlement of Western
and North-Western Australia, which at some future time, and under certain
contingencies that might arise, would have a most important bearing on
the security of the British possessions in India.                     For I am well aware that
men, regarded as authorities in colonial policy, have long ago brought this
subject under the consideration of the Government.                           Nor need I speak of
the enlightened spirit in which the various Governments in Australia have
ever shown themselves ready to assist the cause of exploration and scienti<U+FB01>c
research.    The many and valuable contributions that science, in nearly
every  one  of   its branches, has received from the colonies cannot fail to                         _
assure us of their assistance and cooperation in a systematic and scienti<U+FB01>c
exploration of the unknown interior round which they are clustered.                               I
feel con<U+FB01>dent there needs but an impulse from England, and the sanction
of its highest scienti<U+FB01>c authorities, to secure for the undertaking a ready
assent and strenuous support on the part of the people and the Govern
ments of Australia.

II. “On            some    New        Derivatives        of     Acetone.”              By Maxwau.
             Sun'son, M.D., F.R.S.                    Received     April       18, 1868.
  The compounds which form the subject of the present paper came acci
dentally under my notice whilst I was engaged in an unsuccessful attempt
to form leucic acid by a new synthesis.
   By saturating a mixture of acetone and absolute alcohol with dry hydro
chloric acid gas, I had hoped to form a body having the composition
             Cs]:["9(Jl-(J3HUO+CHHo O+HCI=C5                            H11    QCl+H,0,
and that this, when treated successively with cyanide of potassium and caustic
potash, would have yielded the desired acid according to the following
equations     :—
                    C5   HUOCI +KCy=05 Hll GCy-i- KC],
and

it sutliciently pure for analysis.          I  therefore subjected it directly (having
simply washed it with a dilute solution of carbonate of soda) to the action
of the before-mentioned reagents *. The results were altogether unex—

pected.
    I  have since ascertained that the- chlorinated         oil can  be obtained without
the intervention       of alcohol.     I will  now give a detailed account of my ex
periments.
    Dry hydrochloric acid          gas was passed to saturation        into a quantity of
pure acetone contained in          a glass vessel surrounded     with cold water.     The
product was set aside for ten or twelve days, and then well washed with a
 dilute solution of carbonate of soda. Equal weights of the oil thus formed
and of pure cyanide of potassium were then introduced into a glass balloon
together with a large quantity of alcohol.               The balloon was attached to a
reversed Liebig’s condenser,           and subjected for about twelve hours to the
 temperature of a water-bath.            At the expiration of this time its contents
were, when quite cold, <U+FB01>ltered, and the precipitate well washed with cold
 alcohol, and then with cold distilled water till the wash-water ceased to
give a precipitate with nitrate of silver.           Awhite powder was thus obtained
which was insoluble in cold water and in cold alcohol.                   Boiling alcohol,
however, dissolved it to a small extent, from which              it crystallized on cool
ing   in beautiful    shining plates    like  naphthaline.     These   sublime at a high
 temperature (about 300° 0.), apparently without decomposition.                    It is a
neutral body and contains nitrogen.               It does not evolve ammonia when
heated with an alcoholic        solution of caustic potash.         It is decomposed by
 nitrous    acid, with the production of a compound having acid properties.
 The composition of this body             I hope to be able to give in a future com
 munication.
     I will  now turn to the alcoholic         solution  <U+FB01>ltered from the neutral body
 I have just     described.    This I introduced into aballoon together with some
 sticks of caustic potash.          The balloon was then attached to a reversed

      The salt was obtained in beautiful mother-of-pearl plates by boiling a
solution of the acid with an excess of freshly prepared oxide of silver.                           It
 is very soluble in water, and is not much affected by light.                         It does not
 suffer decomposition when dried at 100° C.
      The new compound has an acid reaction, and displaces carbonic acid from
 the soluble carbonates.             It is insoluble in cold, pretty soluble in hot water
  and in cold alcohol, and sparingly soluble in ether.                      It melts at 171° C.
  The nitrogen appears to be retained with unusual force within the molecule
  of the      new acid.     It  refuses to give it up in the form of ammonia when sub
 jected to the action of an alcoholic solution of potash, a fact we have already
  learned from the manner of its formation.                   Neither can it be made to yield
  it up by exposing it to the action of nitrous gas. I have tried this gas
   upon a solution of the acid both in water and nitric acid.                          It dissolves
   in large quantity      in  strong hydrochloric         acid, and,   on   standing, crystallizes
   out unaltered, not combining chemically with that body.
        The salts of this acid are, as a general rule, very soluble in water.
   The neutralized acid yields no precipitate with nitrate of silver, corrosive
    sublimate, or chloride of barium.              It renders a solution of acetate of lead
   but slightly      turbid,   and   communicates a red colour to perchloride of iron
   without precipitating it.
        lee     soda-salt is very soluble and does not crystallize well.                   It is pre
    pared     by  neutralizing    the   acid  with     carbonate  of   soda.     One    molecule    of
    the    acid,  assuming    it to  have   the  composition Cd HIa N08,         1  found    required
    exactly one molecule of pure and recently ignited carbonate of soda for
    complete neutralization.            This experiment, and the composition                   of the
    silver—salt, render it highly probable that the acid is monobasicl
         The mercury-salt        crystallizes in beautiful pearly plates.            It is prepared
     by boiling asolntion of the acid with freshly precipitated oxide of mercury.
     It is a very soluble salt.

   When acetone is saturated with hydrochloric acid, several condensed
compounds are formed, which remain in union with the acid.      The ques
tion now arises, which of these compounds generate the acid we have just
been studying? and which the neutral body ? In the hope of determining
this point, I prepared the two most important of these compounds in a
state of purity, namely oxide of mesityle and phoron, and saturated them
with hydrochloric acid gas. After the lapse of twelve hours the two satu
rated bodies were well washed with water, and treated separately with
cyanide of potassium and caustic potash in the manner I have just de
scribed.   The results were decisive. The mesityle compound yielded the
acid, and the phoron compound the neutral body.      The following equa
tions will explain the formation of the acid :—

are obtained by the splitting up of compounds containing  large number                       a

1868.]                                 of    the Series    C" Hm“.                                      373
used consisted of a glass <U+FB02>ask of about one litre capacity, the narrow neck
of which was several feet in length, and surrounded by a wider tube through
which cold water <U+FB02>owed.        The hydrocarbons treated in this way were
hexylhydride and octylhydride (from petroleum), and diamyl.     They were
heated with the acid as long as red fumes were evolved; the liquid left in
the <U+FB02>ask was then distilled in a retort, until the unaltered hydrocarbon
together with the greater part of the diluted nitric acid had passed over.
The syrupy residue was heated in a steam-bath as long as nitric acid va
pours escaped.  A thick syrupy mass was left, from which, on cooling, 9.
crystallized        acid was deposited;             on adding water these           crystals   dissolved,
whilst thick yellowish oil separated.
            a                          This oil is insoluble in water, but
somewhat soluble in the aqueous solution of the crystalline acid, which
therefore cannot be obtained quite free from the oily substance by recrystal
lization only; but this may be effected by washing the crystals with cold
ether, which dissolves very little of them, whilst the oil itself is very soluble.
The acid obtained from octylhydride and that from diamyl melted at 180°
0., and showed all the characteristic reactions of succinic acid; that from
hexylhydride, from which I obtained only a very small quantity, could not
be completely freed from the yellow oil, and therefore did not show a de<U+FB01><
nite melting-point ; it began to fuse at about 120°, and became perfectly
liquid at 150°; it exhibited, however, all the reactions of succinic acid;
and the following analyses, although they do not agree very well, yet show
that it was this compound.    From the acids the calcium and the silver-salt
were prepared by neutralizing the aqueous solution with calcium carbonate
and concentrating the <U+FB01>ltered solution by boiling, when the salt separated
in microscopic needles. Calcium succinate obtained in this way has the
formula CJII‘ Ca04+H20; the quantities of water and calcium found
agree with this composition.   The water was determined by drying the salt
at 180° 0., and the calcium by heating the dried salt over the blowpipe
until the residue had a constant weight.

into a red resinous substance.            It dissolves very easily in fuming nitric
acid; on boiling this solution for some time the oil is converted into a
white solid, which separates as crystalline powder on addition of water, and
which crystallizes from alcohol in large <U+FB02>at needles. I did not obtain su<U+FB02>i
 cient of this compound for a satisfactory analysis ; also the quantity of suc
 cinic acid obtained is always very small in comparison to the amount of
hydrocarbon used, which is to the greatest part oxidized to water and car
 bonic dioxide.
     The distillate obtained after the oxidation contains, besides unaltered
 hydrocarbon and diluted nitric acid, also a small quantity of fatty acids and
 0f nitriles.   I have only examined those which were derived from diamyl.
 The liquid Was neutralized with sodium-carbonate, the diamyl separated
 and distilled ; after the hydrocarbon had passed over, the thermometer rose,
 and between 2300—235" a small quantity of a yellowish liquid passed over,
 which had the characteristic smell of the nitriles of the fatty acids.                   On
 heating it with an alcoholic potash solution, ammonia was given o<U+FB01>‘.                I  tried
 to convert the potassium-salt       thus  obtained  into  the  silver-salt,  but obtained
 the latter only in small quantity and in an impure state, so that                 I  could
 not analyze it.      The boiling-point of the nitrile agrees with that. calculated
 for caprinitrile,   C,0  H“, N. The solution of the sodium-salts was evaporated,
 and the residue distilled      with a small quantity of nitric acid; the acid dis—
 tillate, on which oily drops swam, smelt of valerianic acid.                  It was neu
 tralized with ammonia, and precipitated with silver-nitrate in three fractions.
                (1)     Fraction contained 45'27 per cent. of silver.

 with nitric acid, consisted therefore of mnanthylic, valcrianic, and no doubt
 also caproic acids.
     I have further examined the products which are obtained by oxidizing
 the amyl acohol derived from petroleum.                    I
                                                        As have shown in a former
 communication*,         the anin compounds obtained from fusel-oil appear to
 be identical with those from petroleum, as they have the same speci<U+FB01>c gra
 vity and the same boiling-points; the only difference which found is that  I
 the boiling-point ofamylhydride is about 4° higher than that derived from
 the fermentation alcohol. The whole quantity of amyl alcohol which                   I  had
prepared from petroleum was only             3 grammes.        As oxidizing mixture         I
used a solution of two parts of potassium bichromate in ten parts of water,
to which was added three parts of sulphuric acid.               The alcohol was added
to the cold liquid, and the reaction moderated by surrounding the <U+FB02>ask with
cold water.      As soon as the reaction was <U+FB01>nished the liquid was distilled,
and the acid distillate, which smelt strongly of valerianic acid, neutralized

 solved, which was removed, and the solution of the sodium-salt evaporated
 to dryness.       The residue was distilled with sulphuric acid, and from the
 distillate, on which an oily acid swam, a silver-salt prepared.
        (1)    0'3190   of this salt gave 0'1830 Ag.
        (2)    02408 of salt of another preparation gave 0'1358 Ag.
    Salt No. 1 contained, therefore, 573 per cent. Ag, and No. 2 56'4 per
 cent. Ag.      This composition di<U+FB01>'ers very much from silver-valerate, which
 contains 51'67 per cent. Ag; yet the characteristic odour of the distillate
leaves no doubt that a considerable quantity of valerianic acid was present,
which must have been mixed with a lower member of the fatty acid series.
I  soon found that acetic acid was present; for on distilling the residue in
the retort and collecting separately the last distillate, a liquid was obtained
which smelt of acetic acid. It was converted into the silver-salt.                0-2340
of this   salt gave 0'1485 Ag, or contained 63'46 per cent. Ag, whilst the
 calculated    percentage is 64'67 per cent.           Pedler has found that active
amyl     alcohol yields on oxidation, besides valerianic acid, a considerable
quantity     of acetic acid*, the   same products, therefore, as amyl alcohol from
petroleum.'
    The neutral oil above mentioned          was   treated again with the oxidizing
mixture,     which had hardly any action on          it in the cold; it was therefore
dried    and distilled.    The greatest portion        boiled    between 97°—l20°, and
distilled on recti<U+FB01>cation nearly wholly between 95°—105°.                 It had a plea
sant fruity smell, and formed with hydrogen sodium-sulphite a crystalline
compound.         The analysis yielded the following results :—
   0'3080 substance gave 0'7740 CO2 and 03220 H2                   0.

376                  Mr. Schorlcmmer      on the Constitution       of      [May   14-,
How this compound, which without doubt was an aceton, has been formed
I am at a loss to understand. The very small quantity of liquid boiling
above 120° consisted chie<U+FB01> y of amylvalerate;          at least it had the odour of
this ether.
    I  should have wished to be able to give more de<U+FB01>nite results, but the
preparation of amyl alcohol from petroleum is dif<U+FB01>cult and requires a very
long time;      But as the oxidation-products of the different amyl alcohols
are being at present investigated by different chemists,            I  thought it would
not be without interest to publish these incomplete results.
 V. “ On the Constitution of Capryl Alcohol from Castor-oil.”
        By C. SCHORLEMMER. Communicated by Prof. G. G. S'ronss,
         Sec. R.S.      Received May 7, 1868.
     There is perhaps no other compound known which has been so often
 and so fully investigated by different chemists, and yet whose constitution
 is clouded in so much obscurity, as the alcohol which is obtained by dis
 tilling castor-oil soap with caustic alkalics. From the time of its discovery
 until recently, this compound has been alternately considered by one in
 vestigator to be capryl or octyl alcohol, and by another to consist of
 (Bnanthyl or heptyl alcohol.        As a proof that it is capryl alcohol, Bouis
 states that, by the moderate action of nitric acid, a small quantity of caprylic
 acid is produced, the greater part of the alcohol, however, being oxidized
 to lower members of the fatty acid series”; and Kolbe concludes, from the
 formation of these acids, that it is a secondary or isoalcohol, probably
                         '        CII1
 methyl-hexyl carbinol, C         C<U+FB01><U+FB01>mfl'.
                                             As  I shall show in this paper, Kolbe’s
                                  0H
 view is correct; by moderate oxidation, the alcohol loses two atoms of
 hydrogen, and is converted into the corresponding acetone, methyl (nnanthol,
  the same compound which' is' generally obtained as a byeproduct in the
  preparation of the alcohol.       The alcohol which I used was prepared by
  distilling a mixture of caster-oil soap and caustic soda in a <U+FB02>ask of thin
  copper-sheeting      as quickly as possible.       The distillate was repeatedly
  recti<U+FB01>ed over fused caustic potash, the portion boiling below 200° C. only
  being collected.      The alcohol was isolated from this liquid by fractional
  distillation ; its corrected boiling-point was 181° C. The portions having a
 lower boiling-point consist of hydrocarbons, which combine with bromine,
  probably members of the ole<U+FB01>ne series, amongst which octylene, boiling at
  125° C., preponderates.       A considerable quantity of liquid distilled above

 this fraction nor any other distillate contained an acetone, as none com.
 bined with hydrogen-sodium     sulphite. According to Chapman, the liquid
 boiling at 170° consists chie<U+FB02>y of heptyl alcohol*.       In order to isolate
 this alcohol, I acted upon the liquid boiling between 160°—l 75° with iodine
 and phosphorus.      The product, subjected to fractional distillation, was
 found to consist of isoctyl iodide, boiling at 210°-215°, and of hydrocar
 bons, distilling below 160°; the portion which came over between 160°
 and 210°. was very small, and diminished after each further distillation.
This shows that no heptyl alcohol was present, and that the original liquid
boiling at 170° was a mixture of isoctyl alcohol and hydrocarbons, which
could not be separated by simple fractioning.
     To obtain the oxidation products of isoctyl alcohol, I acted upon it with
a solution consisting of 3 parts of sulphuric acid, 2 parts of potassium
bichromate, and 10 parts of water, the reaction being moderated by sur
rounding the vessel with cold water.       As soon as no further action was
observed, the liquid was distilled.    The distillate consisted of an aqueous
liquid, which had a slight acid reaction, and a light oily <U+FB02>uid; it was neu
tralized with sodium carbonate, and the oil treated again with the oxidizing
mixture, which, however, had hardly any action upon it in the cold.       This
oily liquid is methyl ocnanthol; it has the characteristic odour of that
compound, and when shaken with a concentrated solution of hydrogen
sodium sulphite, solidi<U+FB01>es to a mass of pearly white crystals.     These were
dried between blotting-paper, and decomposed by a dilute solution of caustic
soda.    The oil which separated was dried over calcium chloride; it dis
tilled completely between l70°—l72°, the boiling-point of methyl ocnanthol
being 171°.
  In order to oxidize this compound further, it had to be heated with the
oxidizing mixture, when a slight evolution of carbon dioxide was observed.
The acid distillate was neutralized with sodium carbonate, and the acetone
nnacted upon treated again as before.    The different solutions of the so
dium-salts were evaporated, and the solid residue decomposed by diluted
sulphuric acid. An oily acid separated, which, after drying, distilled at
1980—200",   which is the boiling-point of caproic acid, the characteristic
odour of which it also exhibited.     To place beyond doubt that        was        it.

                                  white curdy precipitate was obtained,
which was nearly insoluble in cold water, and only slightly soluble in
boiling water.  It did not darken either by exposure to the light or to                  a
temperature of 100°.    From the hot saturated solution             it   separated as    a

and this grouping must therefore also exist in caproic acid and in isoctyl
alcohol.   To obtain evidence respecting this question,     converted the I
alcohol into the corresponding hydride by a very simple method, which is a
general  one, and by which, with the greatest ease, the corresponding
hydrocarbon   can be obtained from any alcohol.    The alcohol was <U+FB01>rst
converted into the iodide, which was brought together with zinc turnings
and diluted hydrochloric acid in a <U+FB02>ask which was surrounded with cold
water.    After a few hours the heavy layer of iodide had disappeared, and
a light liquid swam on the top.      This consisted almost entirely of the
hydrocarbon Cs H“i ; traces of iodide and alcohol which still adhered were
removed by treating the liquid with sulphuric and nitric acids, and by
distilling it over sodium.   The pure hydrocarbon      boils constantly at
124° C., and has the speci<U+FB01>c gravity 97083 at 12°'5.

    DEAR SlR,-—Some days ago I had the pleasure of receiving your kind
letter of the 12th February, and the same day I was informed that the sum
 necessary for a new Polar Expedition was furnished by some private gentle
men of Gottenburg.          Since then this undertaking has been embraced with
great interest by the Swedish Government and the navy, who have granted
the new espedition a strong and excellent screw-steamer, which will be
supplied with provisions for a year.
    The main object of the expedition will be to penetrate northward from
Spitzbergen ; but several naturalists will also accompany it.
     I  hope the new undertaking will be embraced by you with the same in
 terest as the former ones, though the measurement of an arc of meridian
 does not yet make the aim of our enterprise.           But I think that during the
  xpedition    I shall be able to amend my omission of measuring the hill south
of   Fairhavem“, which surely will furnish an excellent datum for determining

                                    §    I.   Introduction.
  The author states that at the time of the publication of the “ Observations
on the Spectra of the Fixed Stars,” made jointly by himself and Dr. \V.
A. Miller, Treas. R.S., they were fully aware that the direct comparisons
of the bright lines of terrestrial substances with the dark lines in the
spectra of the stars, which they had accomplished, were not only of value
for the more immediate purpose for which they had been undertaken,
namely, to obtain information of the chemical constitution of the invest
ing atmospheres of the stars, but that they might possibly serve to reveal
something of the motions of the stars relatively to our system.     If the
stars were moving    towards or from the earth, their motion, compounded
with the earth's motion, would alter to an observer on the earth the re—
frangibility of the light emitted by them, and consequently the lines of
          substances would no longer coincide in position
terrestrial                                                  the spectrum          in
with the  dark  lines produced by   the absorption of  the vapours of the
same substances existing in the stars.
   The method employed              by
                               them would certainly have revealed an altera
tion of refrangibility as great as that which separates the lines D.  They
had, therefore, proof that the stars which they had examined, among
others        Aldebaran, Orionis,

                 it

parallax  has been ascertained, would make        probable that any alteration

1868.]           Mr. W. Huggins     on the Spectra  of the Sun.            383
    The author has since, for several years, devoted much time and labour
to this investigation,    and believes that   he has obtained   a satisfactory
result.
    He refers to Doppler, who <U+FB01>rst suggested that the relative motion of
the luminous object and the observer would cause an alteration of the
wave-length of the light; and to Ballot, Klinkerfucs, Sonnchc, Fizeau, and
Secchi, who have written on the subject.
    The author is permitted to enrich his paper with a statement of the
in<U+FB02>uence of the motions of the heavenly bodies -on light, and of some ex—
 periments made in an analogous direction, which he received in June 1867
from Mr. J. C. MaxWell, F.R.S.
    It is shown that if the light of the star is due to the luminous vapour
 of sodium or any other element which gives rise to vibrations of de<U+FB01>nite
 period, or if the light of the star is absorbed by sodium-vapour, so as to
 be de<U+FB01>cient in vibrations of a de<U+FB01>nite period, then the light, when it
 reaches the earth, will have an altered period of vibration, which is to the
 period of sodium as V+v is to V, when V is the velocity of light and v is
 the velocity of approach of the star to the earth. Equal velocities of sepa
 ration or approach give equal changes of wave-length.
                        §  II.  Description of Apparatus.
     A  new spectroscope is described, consisting in part of compound prisms,
 which gives a dispersive power equal to nearly seven prisms of 60° of
 dense <U+FB02>int glass.      Various methods were employed for the purpose of
 ensuring perfect accuracy of relative position in the instrument between
 the star spectrum and the terrestrial spectrum to be compared with it.
 A new form of apparatus, which appears to be trustworthy in this respect,
 was contrived.      Many of the observations were made with vacuum-tubes
 or electrodes of metal, placed before the object-glass of the telescope.
                         §  III. Observations  of Nebulae.
     The author states that he has examined satisfactorily the general cha
 racters of the spectra of about seventy nebulae.     About one-third of these
 give a spectrum of bright lines; all these spectra may be regarded as mo
 di<U+FB01>cations of the typical form, consisting of three bright lines, described
 in his former papers.
     Some of these nebulae     have been reexamined with the large spectro
 scope   described in this paper, for the purpose of determining whether any
 of them were possessed of a motion that could be detected by a change of
  refrangibility, and whether the coincidence which had been observed of
 the <U+FB01>rst and the third line with a line of hydrogen and a line of nitrogen
 would be found to hold good when subjected to the test of a spreading
 out of the spectrum three or four times greater than that under which the
 former    observations  were made.      The spectrum of the Great Nebula in
  Orion was very carefully examined by several different methods of com
 parison of its spectrum with the spectra of terrestrial substances.

3841             Mr. W. Huggins on         the Spectra  of the Sun.    [May   14-,
   The coincidence of the lines with those of hydrogen and nitrogen re
mained     apparently perfect with an apparatus in which a difference in
wave-length of 00460 millionth of a millimetre would have been detected.
These results increase greatly the probability that these lines are emitted
by nitrogen and hydrogen.
    It was found that      when the intensity of the spectrum of nitrogen was
diminished     by removing the induction-spark in nitrogen to a greater dis
tance from the slit, the whole spectrum disappeared with the exception of
the double line, which agrees in position with the line in the nebulae, so
that, under these circumstances,        the spectrum of nitrogen resembled the
monochromatic       spectra of some nebulae.      It is obvious that if the spec
trum of hydrogen were greatly reduced in intensity, the strong line in the
blue, which corresponds to one of the lines of the nebular spectrum,
would remain visible after the line in the red and the lines more refran
gible than F had become too feeble to affect the eye.
    It is a question of much interest whether the few lines of the spectra of
these nebulae represent the whole of the light emitted by these bodies, or
whether these lines are the strongest lines only of their spectra which have
succeeded in reaching the earth.            Since these nebulae are bodies which
have a sensible diameter, and in all probability present a continuous lumi
nous surface, we cannot suppose that any lines have been extinguished by
the effect of the distance of the objects from us.           If we had reason to
believe that the other lines which present themselves in the spectra of
nitrogen and hydrogen were quenched on their way to us, we should have
 to regard their disappearance as an indication of a power of extinction
 residing in cosmical space, similar to that which was suggested from theo
 retical considerations    by Chcseaux, and was afterwards supported on other
 grounds by     Olbers  and  the elder Struve.
    It  is also  shown    that  at the time of the observations this nebula was
not receding from us with a velocity greater than 10 miles per second;
for this motion, added to the earth’s orbital velocity, would have caused
 a want of coincidence of the lines that could have been observed.         If  the
nebula were approaching our system, its velocity might be as much as
20 or 25 miles per second, for part of its motion of approach would be
masked by the effect of the motion of the earth in the contrary direction.
                           § 1V.   Observations   ofStars.
    A  detailed description is given of the comparisons of the line in Sirius
 corresponding to F, with a line of the hydrogen spectrum, and of the
 various precautions which were taken against error in this dif<U+FB01>cult and
 very delicate inquiry.       The conclusions arrived at are :—that the sub
 stance in Sirius which produces the strong lines in the spectrum of that
 star is really hydrogen; further, that the aggregate result of the motions
 of the star and the earth in    space,  at the time the observations were made,

was to degrade the refrangibility of the dark line in Sirius by an amount
of wave-length equal to 0'109 millionth of a millimetre.
   If the velocity of light be taken at 185,000 miles per second, and the
wave-length of F at 486'50 millionths of a millimetre, the observed altera
tion in period of the line in Sirius will indicate a motion of recession
between the earth and the star of 41‘4 miles per second.
   At the time of observation, that part of the earth’s motion which was
in the direction of the visual ray, was equal to a velocity of about 12 miles
per second from the star.
  There remains unaccounted          for   a motion    ofrecession from the earth
amounting to 29'4 miles per second, which             we appear to be entitled to
ntlribute to Sirius.
  Reference is made to the inequalities in the proper motion of Sirius;
and it is stated that at the present time the proper motion in Sirius in
declination is less than its average amount by nearly the whole of that
part of it which is variable, which circumstance may show that a part of
the motion of the star is now in the direction of the visual ray.
   Independently of the variable part of its proper motion, the whole of
the motion which can be directly observed by us is only that portion of
its real motion which is at right angles to the visual ray. Now it is pre
cisely the other portion of    it,   which we could scarcely hope to learn from
ordinary observations, which     is   revealed to us by prismatic observations.
By combining both methods of research,       may be possible to obtain some
                                               it
knowledge   of the real motions of the brighter stars and nebulae.
   Observations and comparisons, similar to those on Sirius, have been
made on a Canis Minoris, Castor, Betelgeux, Aldebaran, and some other
stars.  The author reserves the results until these objects have been re
examined.    It   isbut seldom that the atmosphere              is   favourable      for the
successful prosecution of this very delicate research.
                       §   V. Observations     of   the Sun.
   The author has observed the sun with three distinct objects     view :—    in
   1. He has sought to discover     the spectrum of the light from the less
                                      if
luminous part of the sun near the limb, differs in any respect from that of
the light from the central parts of his disk.
   2. He hoped to obtain     aview of the red prominences visible during                  a
solar eclipse by reducing the light from our atmosphere by dispersion;
for, under these circumstances,    the red prominences give

                                                                         a

and might become visible.
  Ilis observations in these two directions have been hitherto unsuccessful.
   3. He proposed to seek to gain from an examination of the spectra of
the umbrae and penumbree of solar spots, some information as to the
nature of these phenomena.  He has successfully applied the large spec
troscope, already described, to the light from the umbra of             a    spot.

 386                    LII-JV.   Huggins    on the Spectrum                  [May  14-,
    His observations     are in accordance generally with those communicated
 by  Mr. Lockyer to      the Royal Society.
    The author describes the examination of a spot on April 15th, 1868.
 He shows that about three-fourths of the apparent light of the umbra
 came from that region of the sun, and the remaining fourth from the in
 tervening illuminated atmosphere of the earth.             He observed an increase
 of width in most of the dark lines of the solar spectrum.                 The lines C
 and  F,  due to hydrogen, did not appear stronger            in  the  spectrum of the
 umbra.      No new lines were detected, nor were any of those of the normal
 solar spectrum     observed to be wanting in the spectrum of the light from
 the umbra.      N0 bright lines were seen.
    Some of the conditions of the solar surface are considered which the
 phenomena observed may be supposed to indicate.
    A cooler state of the heated vapours by which the lines of absorption
are produced would diminish the radiation from the gas itself, and so
leave more completely uncompensated the absorption by the gas of the
light from behind it. Though in this way an apparent increased inten
sity of the dark lines would result, the observations seem to suggest a state
of the vapours connected with tension and temperature in which their
power of absorption for each line embraces an increased range of wave
length.      Some of the conditions under which this state of things may be
brought about are discussed.
    The absence of bright lines is not considered as conclusive of the com
plete absence of light in the umbra from luminous gas; for if there existed
in the spot or above it the same vapours in a cooler state, the light would
be almost wholly absorbed, and the feebler emanations of the cooler vapour
might not do more than render less intense the dark gaps produced by
the vapours     in the stronger light of all refrangibilities which is evidently
present.
    What is the source of the light in the umbra which gives the continuous
spectrum?       May the dense and intensely heated gases, which probably
form the inner substance of the sun, emit, in some cases, lines so greatly
expanded as to form, when numerous spectra are superposed, a sensibly
continuous spectrum?          Dr. Balfour Stewart has suggested that, as gases
possess a power of general absorption of light, a heated mass of gas,                 if
sufficiently   dense  to be opaque or nearly so, would give a continuous          spec
trum as well as the spectrum of bright lines peculiar to it.

examined the spectrum of another small and faint comet in May l867.
The spectra of these objects, as far as their very feeblelight permitted them
to be observed, appeared to be very similar.                 In the case of each of these
comets, the spectrum of the minute nucleus appeared to consist of a bright
line between B and F, about the position of the double line of the spec
trum of nitrogen, while the nebulosity surrounding the nucleus and forming
the coma gave a spectrum which was apparently continuous.
    Unfavourable       weather prevented me from obtaining an observation of
Brorsen’s      comet,   at its present reappearance, before April 29.                   Since that
evening    I   have examined it on May 2, 4, 6, 7, l2, 13. As                         I   have not
noticed any change in its spectrum during this time,                    I   will put together
the results of my observations on di<U+FB02>'erent nights, in order to avoid the
repetition which would occur if the observations were arranged in the order
in which they were made.
    I tried various spectroscopes upon this object. The best views of its
 spectrum were obtained with a spectroscope of the form already described
in my former papers*, and furnished with one prism of very dispersive <U+FB02>int
glass, with a refracting angle of 60°.              Some measures were taken with a
 similar spectroscope, with two prisms of 60°.
    The comet appears in the telescope as a nearly round nebulosity, in
 which the light increases rapidly towards the centre, where on some occa
 sions I detected, I believe, a small stellar nucleus.                 Generally this minute
 nucleus was not     to  be distinguished from the bright central part of the comet.

 388     Mr. W. Huggins      on the Spectrum     of B'ro'rsen’s Comet. [May 14,
bands.     The length of the bands in the instrument shows that they are not
 due alone to the stellar nucleus, but are produced by the light of the
 brighter portions of the coma.
    I took some pains to learn the precise character of these luminous hands.
When the slit Was wide they resembled the expanded lines seen in some
gases; for example, the line F in the spectrum of hydrogen at the atmo
 spheric pressure.    As the slit was made narrow the two fainter bands,
 namely the one in the yellow and the one in the blue, appeared to fade out
 without becoming more de<U+FB01>ned.         I was unable to resolve these bands into
lines.    In this respect they are very different from the bright lines   of the
 nebulae, which become narrow as the slit is made narrow.
    The middle band, which is      so much brighter than the others that it may
 be considered to represent probably three-fourths, or nearly so, of the whole
 of the light which we receive from the comet, appears to posses similar
 characters.   In this nebulous band, however, I detected occasionally two
 bright lines, which appeared to be shorter than the band, and may be
 due to the nucleus itself.    This suspicion seems to be strengthened by the
 circumstance that when by moving the telescope the image of the comet
was made to pass before the slit, these brighter lines were only observed
when the middle of the comet was upon the slit, while the nebulous band
continued as long as any part of the comet, except its extreme margin, was
upon the slit.
    Besides these three bright bands there was a very faint continuous spec
trum.     This spectrum is omitted in the diagram, as it could scarcely be
represented without making it appear too strong relatively to the bright
bands.
    The position in the spectrum of the bands was determined by micro
metrical measures, and also by simultaneous comparison, of the bands with
the bright lines of magnesium, sodium, hydrogen, and nitrogen.              The
brightest band, which is in the green part of the spectrum, is nearly in the
position of the brightest line of the nebulae, which coincides with the double
line of the spectrum of nitrogen; but, as the diagram shows, the band in
the comet is in a small degree less refrangible than the line of nitrogen.
This difference of refrangibility cannot be attributed to the comet’s
motion, since at the time the observations were made the comet was ap
proaching the earth.
    The band in the blue is considerably more refrangible than F, and is
nearly as refrangible as the group of bright lines in the air-spectrum, which
have the numbers 2642, 2669 in the map and tables of my paper “On
the Spectra of the Chemical Elements” *.
    The least refrangible of the bands occurs in the yellow part of the spec
trum, at about the distance from E of one-third of the interval which sepa
                                           '
rates E from D.
    The spectrum of this comet resembles the diagram given by Donati of

the spectrum of Comet 1., 1864 *.      The positions of the three bands seen
by him appear     to agree with those which the bright bands of this comet
occupy.
   This comet differs remarkably from the two small comets which I ex
amined in the much smaller relative proportion of the light which forms a
continuous spectrum.    In Brorsen's comet, as it now appears, the bright
middle part of the nebulosity seems to have a constitution analogous at
least to that of the nucleus, and to be self-luminous; in the other comets
the coma, which surrounded  a distinctly marked nucleus, gave a continuous
spectrum.    The three comets resemble each other in the circumstance
that the light of the bright central part was emitted by the cometary
matter, while the surrounding nebulosity re<U+FB02>ected solar light.
   The telescopic observations of the heads of Donati’s comet and of other
large comets have shown that the luminous material is not at once driven
off into the outer portions of the coma and the tail, but usually forms in
front of the nucleus a dense luminous cloud, which for a time seems to be
identical in the character of its light with that of the nucleus.      It                    is,
                                                                                              I
believe, the outer portions only of the coma, which are frequently sepa
rated   bydark spaces from the nucleus, and the tail, which the polariscope
has shown to shine by re<U+FB02>ected light.
   The positions of the bands in this comet would seem to indicate        che            a
mical constitution different from that of the nebulae, which give    spectrum        a
of bright lines.   It will be seen in the diagram that, though the brightest
of the bands in the spectrum of the comet di<U+FB01>'ers but little in position from
the brightest line of the nebulae, the other bands are found in parts of the
spectrum widely removed from those in which the other lines of the
nebulae occur.    The suggestion presents itself whether the broad, uebu
lous bands may not indicate conditions of temperature and molecular state
different from those which occur in the gaseous nebulae.         Pliicker has
shown that nitrogen and some other substances give totally different spectra,
under different conditions of temperature and tension. The spectrum of this
comet, however, does not resemble the other spectrum of nitrogen, which
Pliicker distinguishes as the spectrum of the <U+FB01>rst order'l‘.

390                     Mr. M. Gardiner   on Undevelopable           [May   14-,
the direct, general, and complete     solution of which is claimed to be given
in it for the <U+FB01>rst time.
     Chapter I., after some preliminary general properties, resulting imme
diately from the known properties of homographic          systems of points on
plane conics, treats more particularly of the simplest case of such sys
tems on undevelopable quadrics, viz. of the case of systems in perspective,
the several pairs of whose corresponding constituents possess manifestly
 the property of interchangeability; shows that systems having three double
 points not in the same tangent plane to the quadric on which they lie are
 necessarily of that class, except only when they have a fourth double point
 not in the plane of the other three, in which case they altogether coincide ;
 and gives simple instances in which the problem, whose solution is the
 principal object of the memoir, is manifestly either
                                                           “ wholly or partially
 porismatic,” as he terms it.
     Chapter II. treats of systems whose several pairs of corresponding
 points are interchangeable but which are not in perspective; shows that
 their several chords of connexion intersect the same two reciprocal lines
 with respect to the quadric on which they lie ; shows the relation between
 either system and the perspective of the other to any point on either of
  those lines, also the relation between either of two systems in perspective
 and the perspective of either to any point conjugate to their centre of per
    pective with respect to the surface ; and shows how to construct the two
 reciprocal   lines from two pairs of corresponding points of the systems.
     Chapter   III.  treats of systems whose several pairs of corresponding
 points    connect through a single common line, which have therefore an
 in<U+FB01>nite number of double planes passing through that line; shows that
  their several chords of connexion, besides intersecting the line, all touch
  a second quadric having double contact with the original, both at its two
  points of intersection with the line, and also at its two points of intersec
  tion with the reciprocal line; proves a property of the cone enveloping
  either surface from any vertex taken arbitrarily on either line , shows the
  relation between either system and the perspective of the other to any
  point on either line ; and shows how to construct the two reciprocal lines
  from two pairs of corresponding points of the systems.
      Chapter IV. treats of systems having two of their four double planes
  non-tangential to the quadric on which they lie; shows that the chords
  connecting their several pairs of corresponding points touch two cones en—
  veloping the quadric along two planes colinear with and harmonically con
  jugate to each other with respect to the two non-tangential double planes ;
  proves that those touching along a plane section of either cone generate a
   skew quadric ; shows that the two homographic systems determined by the
   two correspondents in the two systems of a variable point on the quadric
   are of the class considered in the preceding chapter, having an in<U+FB01>nite
   number of double planes passing through the line of intersection of the
   two non-tangential double planes of the original systems; and shows the

relation      between either   system and the perspective     of   the other   to any
 point on that line of intersection.
   Chapter V. treats of systems having their four double planes all tan
gential to the quadric on which they lie, shows that the chords connecting
their several pairs of corresponding points touch two other quadrics having
quadruple contact with the original at the four double points of the systems,
and gives various constructions for the determination of the four double
points when the law connecting the several pairs of corresponding points
of the systems is given or known.
   Chapter VI. gives various criteria for determining in certain cases to
which of the preceding classes two homographic systems belong, where, as
in the problem whose solution forms the principal object of the memoir,
the law connecting the same pairs of corresponding points of the systems
is given or known.
   Chapter VII. contains numerous theorems, several of much interest and
originality, respecting open and closed polygons inscribed in undevelopable
quadrics, whose sides pass in the same order of sequence through a common
system of points in space, all deduced from the principles established in
the preceding chapters, and several having direct reference to the interest
ing problem to be considered in the next and closing chapter.
   Chapter VIII.—Given an undevelopable quadric and 2: <U+FB01>xed points in
to <U+FB01>nd the space; <U+FB01>rst extremities of inscribable closed n’gons, or the locus
of the <U+FB01>rst extremities when the inscription of the closed n’gnns is poris
matic.
                     When the number n    of given points   is odd.
  Assume any three points a1, 6,, c1 in the surface; no two of which are on
one generator, as <U+FB01>rst extremities, and proceed to inscribe 2n’gons.
  (I)    If
         the three points be found to be <U+FB01>rst extremities of closed n’gons,
then will the trace of their plane be the locus of <U+FB01>rst extremities of closed
n’gons, the problem in such case being partially porismatic..
   (2)   If
          the points are <U+FB01>rst extremities of closed 2n‘gons, or   two of them
                                                                      if.
be <U+FB01>rst extremities of closed Zn’gous and the third one      <U+FB01>rst extremity of
                                                               a
aclosed n’gon, or    one of the points he the <U+FB01>rst extremity of a closed

Qn'gon, and the other two points <U+FB01>rst extremities of closed. n’gons, then
the line or lines forming the closing chords of the open n7gons composing
the 2n’gon or 2n’gons (as may be) and the tangent plane or planes at the
<U+FB01>rst extremity or extremities of the closed n’gon or n’gons (as may be)
meet in one point p, the trace of whose polar plane B.      the locus of <U+FB01>rst

extremities of inscribable closed n’gons, the problem in such case being par
tially porismatic.
   (3) If two of the points be <U+FB01>rst extremities of closed n’gons and the
third point the <U+FB01>rst extremity of an open 2n'gon, then the problem  non        is
porismatic,  and the two closed n’gons are the only inscribable closed n’gons.
Moreover   the reciprocal of the line joining the <U+FB01>rst extremities of the two
closed n’gons will pierce the quadric in points which are the <U+FB01>rst extremi

 tiesot'inscribable   closed 2n’gons (real or imaginary according as the quadric
  S is ruled or convex).
    (4)   If one of the three chosen points be the <U+FB01>rst extremity of an open
 2n’gon (no matter as to the other two points) the problem is non-porismatic,
 and we can <U+FB01>nd the <U+FB01>rst extremities of the closed n’gons by either of the
 four following methods :—
    First  method.-—Continue      the 2n’gon until a 4n’g0n be formed, and draw
 the plane    P which contains   the extremities of this 4n’gon and the point of
 junction of the two open 2n’gons composing it. Assume another point in
 the surface, not in the trace of the plane P, and, making it a <U+FB01>rst extremity,
 inscribe another 4n’gon ; and through the extremities of this 4n’gon and
 the point of junction of the two open 2n’gons composing it draw a plane Q.
 Then with the line aw of intersection of the planes P and Q pierce the
 quadric in the only points (real or imaginary as may be) which are <U+FB01>rst
 extremities of closed n’gons; and the line ii reciprocal to am will pierce
 the quadric in points (real or imaginary as may be) which are <U+FB01>rst extre
 mities of closed 2n’gons.
    Second method.—By the additional inscription of another open n’gon
 convert the open 211'an into an open 3n’gon, and put A, B, C to represent
 the three open n’gons composing the open 3n'gon.             Find the point of punc
 ture of the line through the <U+FB01>rst extremity of A and the <U+FB01>nal extremity of
 B with the tangent-plane at the junction of A and B; <U+FB01>nd the point of
 puncture of the line through the <U+FB01>rst extremity of B and the <U+FB01>nal extre
 mity of C with the tangent-plane at the junction of B and G. Then will
 the line 122‘ through the two points of puncture pierce the quadric in two
 points (real or imaginary as may be) which are the <U+FB01>rst extremities of the
 only inscribable closed n’gons; and the line 111',which is reciprocal          to 2.1:,
will pierce in <U+FB01>rst extremities of closed 2n’gons.
    N.B. When S is a hyperboloid of one sheet, and that the <U+FB01>rst extremi
ties of the closed n’gons are real, then the <U+FB01>rst extremities of the closed
2n’gons are also real; and it is evident there are two pairs of generators
which are corresponding interchangeable lines in the homographic <U+FB01>gures
in which the extremities of the inscribable n’gons         are pairs of corresponding
points.     It is moreover evident that when all the corresponding points of
such <U+FB01>gures are not interchangeable,            these are the only pairs of inter
changeable     generators;   and  we must   not   assume the <U+FB01>rst extremities of the
4n’gons or 3n'gons in these lines.
    Third method.-—-Let 0,, 0,, 0,, .  . . 0,, be  the n <U+FB01>xed points through which
the sides must pass in order.
    Assume the constant homological ratio —1 for homological systems, and
making 01 vertex and its polar plane axis, <U+FB01>nd the point at, homological to
the centre    :10 of the quadric; assume      02 as   vertex and its polar plane as
axis, and <U+FB01>nd the point at,: homological       to a, ; and proceed thus directly in
order through the n points until arrived           at the point an.     Assume 0,, as
vertex and its polar plane as axis, and <U+FB01>nd the point at_, homological to the

order through the rest of the n given points until arrived at the point a_,.
(the points at", a_,, will be distinct).  Draw the diametral plane A0 which
bisects the chords parallel to the line can (1..“    will also biseet an 41-“)

extremities of these n’gons draw the plane A”; <U+FB01>nd the line of intersection

the same generator;       and, making them <U+FB01>rst extremities, proceed to inscribe
2n’gons.
    (I) If    these assumed points he found to be <U+FB01>rst extremities of closed
n’gons, the problem is fully porismatic, and every point in the surface will
be the <U+FB01>rst extremity of an inscribable closed n’gon.
    (2)  If  two of the points be found to be <U+FB01>rst extremities of closed n'gons
and the other not, then the line xx through these two points, and the line
ii reciprocal     to xx, pierce the quadric in four points (the punctures made
by   ii being real or imaginary as may be) which constitute the <U+FB01>rst extremi
ties of all the inscribable closed n’gons.
    (3)   If one of the points he the <U+FB01>rst extremity of a closed n’gon, and an
other of them be <U+FB01>rst extremity of a closed 2n’gon.          Draw the closing chord
of the two open n’gons composing the closed 2n’gon to pierce the tangent
plane at the <U+FB01>rst extremity of the closed n’gon in the point p; in the clo
sing chord <U+FB01>nd the point p which is conjugate to the point of puncture p;
through ,1 and the <U+FB01>rst extremity of the closed n’gon draw the line xx, and
<U+FB01>nd the line ii reciprocal to xx. Then will the lines xx and ii pierce the
quadric in the four points which constitute the <U+FB01>rst extremities of all the
inscribable     closed n’gons.
    (4)   If two   of the assumed points he found to be <U+FB01>rst extremities of closed
 2n’gons,    we   may <U+FB01>nd the <U+FB01>rst extremities of the inscribable closed n'gons
by either of the four following methods :—
    Fz'rst method—Draw the two closing chords of the open n’gons compo
sing the 2n’gons; and, if these chords intersect in a point p, draw the line
xx which is polar of p in respect to the trace of the plane of the two chords;
<U+FB01>nd the line ii reciprocalto xx.       Then will xx and ii pierce the quadric in
the <U+FB01>rst extremities of the closed n’gons.          But if the chords do not inter
sect, draw tangent-planes at their extremities ; <U+FB01>nd the two pairs of points
 (one pair in each chord) which divide these closing chords and the seg
ments intercepted by the tangent-planes harmonically; draw the line xx
through the two of these points which divide the chords internally; draw
the line it through the two points which divide the chords externally.
Then will xx and ii be reciprocal lines piercing the quadric in four points
which are <U+FB01>rst extremities of the inscribable closed n’gons.
    Second method—Find           0,0,, 6,6,, c,c, the closing chords of three open
n’gons.       If any two of these intersect, proceed as in the last method ; but
if not, proceed as follows :—-In the chord a,a, <U+FB01>nd the point m which cor
responds to in<U+FB01>nity (on the same line) in one of the homographic <U+FB01>gures
in which the extremities of all inscribable vn‘gons are corresponding in
 terchangeable points ; in the same chord a,a, <U+FB01>nd the two points a: and i
 such that mx=mi= \/ ma, . ma,; through x draw the line xx which cuts
 the two non-planar chords 6,6,, c,c,; through i draw the line ii which cuts
 the same two non-planar chords 6,6,, 0,0,.            Then will xx and ii be reci
 procal lines piercing the quadric in the four points which are the <U+FB01>rst extre
 mities of closed n’gons.

“ methods of     reduction,” amongst which the following is perhaps the most
obvious and simple :—
     Let S be the quadric, and 01 0,. 0,, 0,, . . . 0,, the n given points.    Put :0:
for the line through 0, and 0,. Instead of 0, and 01 we can substitute the
point p, in which the line mm is cut by the plane 0,0,0” and another point
p, determinable in the same line xx. Then instead of the four planar points
12,, 08, 0,, 0, we can (see theorem 38) substitute two other points pa, p, in
the same plane ; and therefore instead of the series of n points, we can sub
 stitute the series of n—2 points p,, p,, 10,, 0,, 0.,, . . . 0,, and the inscribable
 (n— 2)’gons, closed and open as may be, whose sides pass in order through
 these points will have extremities identical with the extremities of inscri
 bable n’gons.      And thus step by step we can reduce the number of sides,
 until at length we <U+FB01>nd three points or four points, according as n is odd or
 even, such that the extremities of all inscribed 3’gons or 41'gons whose sides
 pass in order through such points are identical with extremities of inscri
 bable n'gons whose sides pass through the original n points; and therefore
 to solve the problem all we have to do is to inscribe the closed 3’gons or
 closed 4’gons as may be.
     And in respect to this method we may observe,—
     (1)  If any four consecutive points of any of the series be colinear and
 such as to render the inscription of closed 4’gons real, we may omit such
 points altogether from the series.
      (2) When n is odd, and that we reduce the problem to the inscription
 of closed 3’gons whose sides pass through three known points, then should
 such points he colinear or form a conjugate triad, the problem will be par
 tially porismatic.
     (3) In the case in which n is add, it is easy to perceive how the pro
 blem can be reduced to the drawing of a line through a known point to out
 two reciprocal lines (which point will be on one of the lines when the pro
 blem is partially porismatic).      And when n is even, it is easy to see how
 the problem can be reduced to the drawing of the two lines which cut two
 pair of (determinable) reciprocal lines.
     (4) The following method of <U+FB01>nding the line in the plane of four points
 which pierces in <U+FB01>rst extremities of closed 4’gons is obvious :--Let 0,, 0,,
  0,, 0, be the four planar points.
      Find [1 the point of intersection of the lines 0,0,, 0,0,; in the line 0,0,
  <U+FB01>nd the point m such that 0,0,, mp, and the pair of (real or imaginary)
  points in which 0,0a pierces the quadric, will form an involution; in the line
 0 0, <U+FB01>nd the pointn such that the pairs of points 0,0,, pn, and the points in
  which 0,0, pieces the quadric, form an involution. Then will the line mn
 pierce in <U+FB01>rst extremities   of closed 4’gorts.

I. “A       Comparison     of the Kew and Lisbon Magnetic Curves
       during   the   Magnetic Storm of February 20—25, 1866.”                By
       Senhor I. Bar'ro CAPELLO, of the Lisbon Observatory.                Com
       municated by B. S'rswaa'r.          Received April 18, 1868.
    During the 20th, 21st, 23rd, 24th, and 25th of February 1866, large
magnetic disturbances were recorded by the magnetographs           at the Lisbon
and Kew Observatories.
    As  these indicate several appreciable deviations from the normal types,
I trust   a description of them may be not without interest to the Royal
Society.     Dr. Stewart, Director of the Kew Observatory, has kindly sent
me copies of the Kew magnetic curves during these disturbances.
    In order thoroughly to ascertain the laws governing the forces which
disturb the ordinary magnetic condition of the globe, we should reduce
in  a systematic manner, such as General        Sabine has so ably pursued,   the
observations    made at a number     of stations, and then classify and discuss
the valuable results so obtained.
    Nevertheless the present communication relative to the disturbances ob
served at two stations offers some interest, on account of the apparent
variability of the forces which are in action during the same disturbance,
and also the apparently variable relations        between these forces at Lisbon
and the same forces at Kew.
    In a former comparison made between the magnetic curves of Kew and
 Lisbon (Proceedings of the Royal Society, No. 60), it was established
 that at Lisbon, during disturbances, the vertical force and the declination
 curves were invariably opposed to each other, i. e. a concave wave of one
 of the curves always corresponded with a similar convex one in the other ;
 or, in other words, an augmentation of the vertical force agreed with an
 horizontal movement of the north pole of the bar towards the east, and a
 diminution of the same component to a movement of the north pole to
 the west.
    This general law applied both to the large and slow movements (waves),
 and the short and rapid ones (peaks and hollows).
     However, there were some very rare instances in which this law did not
 altogether hold good.      In these cases, although the peaks and waves were
 reproduced in the two curves in inverted order, yet the whole of the one
 curve for some period did not assume the inverted form of the other
 curve.
     The periods of disturbance      which    are  the objects of this discussion
 belong to these abnormal     types.

     In   the paper quoted above, the authors have also shown,—
      lst. That all the small peaks in the Kew curves are simultaneously re
 produced in the Lisbon curves in the same sense in the declination and
 bi<U+FB01>lar, but in a contrary direction in the vertical force.
     2nd. That, generally, all the waves of the declination and bi<U+FB01>lar at Kew
 were reproduced in the corresponding Lisbon curves, sometimes more or
 less dis<U+FB01>gured.
     3rd. That in the generality of cases, with the exception of peaks and
 hollows, in which they are opposed, the vertical-force curves of the two
  stations do not resemble each other.
     Let us now    see if these laws are con<U+FB01>rmed in these disturbances.
     First Disturbance—T his        series of disturbances commenced at Lisbon,
  February 20th     16h 12‘11  G. M.T., by a sudden increase of the declination,
 and an enormous diminution of the vertical force.            The horizontal force
 likewise decreased rapidly, but 13'n later (16h 25'“) : this is noteworthy.
 However, the three elements, and especially the horizontal force, had been
 somewhat disturbed since 10h 27'“ G. M. T.
     It is noticeable, in the large diminution of vertical force, that although
 the curve in descending ran off the edge of the paper, we can <U+FB01>x the point
 of minimum (approximately), which gives us a little more than 0'1
 (English units) as the value of the disturbance.          The increase in declina
 tion was nearly a degree (59' '3), and the diminution of horizontal force
 0'052 English units.
     This last diminution commenced, as we have before stated, 13'“ later than
 the other disturbances ; and the time of minimum is also 6'“ to 8‘“ after
 the corresponding points of declination and vertical force.
     In other respects the remaining waves of the horizontal force do not
 agree with those of the declination and vertical force.
     The Kew curves agree tolerably well with the Lisbon curves, up to the
 time of the large and rapid movements.              Here it appears that the large
 movements of the three instruments were of the same nature as the
 Lisbon ones; and it is very possible that the large variations were
 more considerable and rapid, since they failed to record their traces on the
 paper.
     These large movements seem to have begun in the three instruments at
  Kew at the same time (16h 30‘“), at which time the Lisbon declination and
 vertical force had deviated to half their full extent.
     The small peaks are reproduced at the two stations at the same absolute
 time, the two vertical forces being always in opposite directions.
     The <U+FB01>rst period of this disturbance seems, therefore, to be of the same
nature in the two stations,      5. e.  the disturbing  forces have acted on the
three instruments      in a similar manner.
     Second Disturbance—Let us now pass to the second period.
    The large movements have ceased, but the horizontal force remains too
low, and in continual vibration.         Towards 2" and 3" of the 21st of February

1868.]          during the Magnetic Storm of February 1866.                    401
we may take as the recommencement        of  a second period, which terminated
about 7 P. M.
    In the Lisbon declination we see at the beginning and end of this period
two similar undulations, each about half an hour in duration, and almost
regular.    In the middle there are smaller waves, interrupted      by peaks and
hollows.     The diminution of declination is not remarkable.               _
    In the vertical force we have the same waves in a contrary direction to
the declination; but the ascending branch is in one instance greater than
the corresponding descent in the declination.          A similar di<U+FB01>'erence may
be noticed in the last wave but one, by which it happens that the vertical
t'orce curve shows an increase of force during two hours and a half, without
a corresponding decrease of the declination.
    The horizontal force retained its position below the mean until 3'1 20’“,
when it descended further till 4"; then it ascended successively till 6“,
where it stopped very nearly in its normal position.
    We will now discuss the Kew curves. The declination has been greatly
disturbed    by large   deviations above and below      its normal   position,   a
general decrease   of declination, however,    taking place during    more    than
three hours of great disturbance.
    The needle has oscillated 40' in arc, while the Lisbon oscillations       have
not exceeded 8'.       Some movements       seem   to agree with Lisbon ones,
others, on the contrary, disagree entirely; and even in those movements
which correspond, some differences of time are appreciable, which cannot
be due to error in the time-scale.
    The vertical force at Kew increases rapidly from       2" 35‘“ to 3h 50‘“ ; a
period of <U+FB02>uctuations then follows up to 5", after which the curve rapidly
descends irregularly to the end.
    The Kew vertical-force curve only agrees with the Lisbon curve in the
general aspect of the disturbances, the period of greatest increase lasting
but 1" 15‘“, while at Lisbon it was 2h 10‘“.
    It should be also remarked that the vertical force does not agree in the
slightest with the horizontal force at Kew.
    The horizontal force at Kew seems to follow the inverse direction of
that of Lisbon, and its general form resembles that of Lisbon inverted.
After 5" 30‘n the waves appear to agree.
    Thus we see, in the same disturbance, two periods at an interval of some
hours, which show their relations at the two stations to be of an entirely
di<U+FB02>'erent nature.
    In the <U+FB01>rst period the three instruments agree ; in the second, the
horizontal components differ, and all similarity is wanting in the vertical
force and declination during the greater part of the total duration.
    A  long calm period, 46" in duration, followed these large disturbances ;
during which the series of small peaks and hollows were reproduced in the
 three curves, chie<U+FB02>y in the morning (1 7h to 21") of the 21st and 22nd days.
     Third Disturbance.-—Another disturbance commenced about GM on the

402         Senhor Capello—Kew and Lisbon Magnetic Curves.                  [May 28,
23rd     of  February,  which lasted up till 12"    30“".    The horizontal force was
in motion from 3h 50'“.
     The general appearance of this disturbance at Lisbon is a large decrease
of declination and horizontal force, and an increase of vertical force for
some hours.
     It  is noteworthy that the waves in the Lisbon curves are clean and
rounded in the declination and vertical force.             The Kew curves show also
fewer peaks and hollows than during the former disturbances.
     At Lisbon this general rule is found to exist : the declination disturbance
is opposite in direction to the vertical force.          The declination curve agrees
very well with the Kew curve; the variations of the latter are larger, as is
 usual.      There is one remarkable     circumstance,     the <U+FB01>rst minimum (6h 33“)
 happens 6‘“ or 7“I before Kew, the other maxima and minima agree, with
 the exception of very small differences, which may be attributed to the
 di<U+FB01>iculty of determining precisely the extreme points of the Lisbon curve,
 on account of their roundness.
     The vertical-force curves show a general similarity, but the connexion
 between the di<U+FB01>'ereut phases is not seen.          It is remarkable that the general
 form of the Kew vertical-force          curve has a great likeness to the Lisbon
 horizontal     force, but in an inverted    order, although the extreme opposite
 points of maxima and minima do not occur at the same time.
     The horizontal-force curves agree very well up to 8“; after this time it
 is easily seen that the Kew curve agrees almost exactly with the Lisbon
 vertical force.
     Fourth Disturbance—Two            less important periods follow this period,
 which terminate about        15h on the    24th: after ten hours of comparative
 calm the magnets are again set in motion at Lisbon, by a deviation of the
 horizontal force and declination and a depression in the vertical force, about
  lh  45‘1n on the 25th.     This disturbance is composed of three large waves,
 much agitated, and full of peaks and hollows, or serrated.
      At the <U+FB01>rst glance we see immediately that the general trait of the
 disturbance is identical at Kew and Lisbon, i. e. the different phases of the
 three instruments agree with one another.
      The Kew curve generally agrees with the Lisbon one, although several
 periods are more developed, particularly some waves between 5" 30‘“ and
  9" more developed at Kew.         The horizontal-force curves also agree; but
 it must be remarked that the waves (between 5h 30m and 9"), which are
 most developed at Kew in the declination, are less developed in the hori
 zontal force than at Lisbon.
     The two vertical-force curves generally agree; but the phases at Kew
 are in advance      of those at Lisbon. The small peaks (those which can be
 identi<U+FB01>ed)      are inverted and simultaneous.        It is also noteworthy that the
 <U+FB01>rst vertical-force movement at Kew is opposite to that at Lisbon.
     The vertical-force Lisbon curve is greater in its movements than the
 declination, and consequently deviates from the general law.

     Thus we     see  that the same periods of certain disturbances are mani
 fested    very ditferently in two stations so near each other as Kew and
 Lisbon. The modi<U+FB01>cation is the greatest, particularly in the periods which
 depart from the general rule at Lisbon, and are doubtless also abnormal
  at Kew.
     From the examples here quoted, it is evident that a great value would
  be attached to the curves from another intermediate station; for the little
  vertical-force peaks and hollows, being opposed at Lisbon and Kew, it
 would be very interesting to see if these peaks would be wholly or nearly
 absent at some intermediate        station.
     With    a certain number      of these magnetographs        very discreetly placed,
 we may one day analyze the different forces acting on the needle in the
 different places on the earth—a manifest desirability.

    This memoir is divided into six parts. The <U+FB01>rst part contains a de<U+FB01>ni
 tion of the subject; the second an historical sketch; the third is on the
 action of nuclei in inducing crystallization, and the effect of low tempera
 tures on a number of supersaturated solutions contained in chemically clean
vessels; the fourth is on the formation of a modi<U+FB01>ed salt, as in the case of
zinco-sulphate      and sodic sulphate;       the  <U+FB01>fth    contains an inquiry as to
 whether anhydrous        salts form supersaturated     solutions; and the sixth and
last part is a summary with a classi<U+FB01>ed list of the salts examined.
     1. De<U+FB01>nition.-—When water at a high temperature is saturated                 with  a
salt, and, on being left to cool in a closed vessel, retains in solution a larger
quantity of the salt than it could take up at the reduced temperature, the
solution is said to be supersaturated.
     2.  History—During          many years the phenomena of supersaturation
were studied with reference to solutions of Glauher’s salt.             In 1809, Ziz of
Mayence“ showed that the sudden crystallization of these solutions is not
due to agitation; that the vessels containing the solutions do not require to
be hermetically sealed; but if put under a bell-glass, or loosely covered as
with a capsule, they can be preserved during a long time; that solids
brought into contact with the solutions act as nuclei and produce instant
crystallization, but that such solids act best as nuclei when dry; if wet or
boiled up with the solution they become inactive.                The most efficient nu
cleus is a crystal of the salt itself.       Air, if arti<U+FB01>cially dried, ceases to be a
nucleus.      Three varieties of the sodic sulphate are noticed, i. e. the anhy
drous and the ordinary         lO—atom   hydrate, and also      a peculiar  salt formed
when supersaturated        solutions in closed vessels are left to cool down.       This

of the saline molecules, the molecular condition of the sides of the vessel,
and other causes.     He also showed that solutions of some other salts exhi
bit the phenomena of supersaturation.        In 1832 the number of such
salts was shown by Dr. Ogden'r to be not less that twenty-one.

between the years 1850 and 1857, the results of which are contained in
six memoirs<U+FB01>l.    According to this writer, the ordinary lO-atom sodic sul
phate increases in solubility from 32° to 93°22 F., at which latter tempera
ture   begins to fuse in its water of crystallization, and to deposit the an
         it
hydrous salt.   This salt follows an inverse order of solubility as compared
with the 10-atom hydrate, its solubility diminishing as the temperature
rises; or, what    the same thing, from 218°, the boiling-point of
                        is                                              satu                          a

undergoes     new molecular modi<U+FB01>cation, and begins to form crystals of the
                 a

                                                                     is
dinary temperatures than the lO-atom hydrate, its maximum solubility being
at 80°‘6.  Thus the sodic sulphate has three maxima of solubility; viz.
93°‘2 when        it   is   under the molecular constitution             of the lO-atom hydrate,
78°‘8 to 80°13 when            it   is   under the molecular          constitution of the 7-at0m
hydrate, and 62°-6 to 64°'4 when                    it   is   under the molecular constitution of
the anhydrous salt.  At these three maxima     the saturated solutions are
about equally rich in salt.  The 7-at0m hydrate and the anhydrous salt
can only maintain their molecular constitution when in contact with the
mother-liquor in closed vessels, in which they are sheltered from the air
and from other bodies that act upon them as nuclei.        No sooner are they
exposed to the air than they become opaque and warm, and assume the mo
lecular constitution of the lO-atom hydrate as well as its solubility. Hence
the conclusion         is   that supersaturated solutions of the sodic sulphate are not
really so, since they           hold salt of much greater solubility at ordinary tem

sodic carbonate and magnesia sulphate, and endeavours to show that in their
supersaturated solutions salts of lower degree of hydration and of greater

  1868.]        Mr, C. Tonilinson        on Supersaturatecl     Saline Solutions,       405
 that all   cases of supersaturation       are in appearance only, and not in fact.
 As    to the function of nuclei and the inner sides of the <U+FB02>asks in determi
 ning crystallization, he regards it as the effect of one of those mysterious
 contact actions known as catalytic, of which science has not yet been able
 to give a satisfactory explanation.          Bodies that appear to be active in indu
 cing crystallization are designated as catalytic or dynamic, while bodies
 that are apparently inactive are termed non-catalytic or adynamz'c.                    “It
 appears    certain,”   he says,  “that    but  for   the  mysterious action    which   the
 air and other bodies exert on supersaturated solutions, we should obtain
 sulphate of soda only in the modi<U+FB01>ed state; that is, crystallized with seven
 equivalents of water, and possessing at ordinary temperatures of the air a
 much greater solubility than that of the normal lO-atom salt.”
     Later inquirers have endeavoured to explain the nature of the force ex
 erted by nuclei      in inducing crystallization under certain conditions, and
 their passivity under others. Gernez“ tried no less than 220 solids, and of
these he selected 39 that were active in inducing crystallization: 18 were
insoluble; these were carefully washed in distilled water, and dried out of
 contact with air.       When dry they were found to be without action on the
 solutions they had previously caused to crystallize.              The 21 soluble subs
 stances were puri<U+FB01>ed by recrystallization, and they all became inactive,
Hence it is concluded that sulphate of soda is the only nucleus for solutions
of the same salt. That is to say, whenever a glass rod or other body acts
as a nucleus, it is contaminated with minute portions of the salt itself, which
 M. Gernez believes to exist in the air, not only of towns, but in the country,
 According to this view, the supersaturated solution of any other salt can only
 be crystallized by a saline nucleus of its own kind. But, as M. JeannelT has
 pointed out, if this theory be true, we must have <U+FB02>oating in the air specis
 mens of all kinds of salts that form supersaturated solutions, and crystallize
by the introduction of a solid nucleus; whereas there are some such salts
which cannot exist in the presence of the oxygen or of the ammonia of the
air.          J
        M. eannel shows that a few drops of an ordinary solution of a salt
will induce crystallization in a supersaturated solution of the same salt
without contact of air.
    3. On the Action of Nuclei.—With respect to the action of nuclei on
saline supersaturated solutions generally, the author refers to a theory of
hisI which seems to account for the liberation of gases from their super.
saturated solutions (soda-water, seltzer-water, champagne, &c) when a
solid nucleus that had been exposed to the air is immersed in them ; while
such nucleus becomes inactive if kept long in water, or passed through
flame &c., and dried or cooled out of contact with air.                    The action of
nuclei is referred to adhesion.          Nuclei   are active in inducing  crystallization,

or they are inactive, according to the state of chemical purity of their sur
faces.  In the case of a supersaturated saline solution, the sides of the
vessel may act as nuclei, or any solid, and some liquid, bodies brought into
contact with it.    Now suppose the inner surface of the vessel to be made
chemically clean, either by well washing it with strong sulphuric acid, or
caustic alkali, or spirits of wine, or, as often happens, by boiling the saline
solution in the vessel in which it is intended to he kept.       In such cases
there is perfect adhesion between the sides and the solution, and no salt will
be liberated; the sides may in fact be regarded as merely a continuation of
the liquid itself, and no salt can be formed there any more than in the cen
tral parts of the liquid. But suppose the sides to be not chemically clean,
to be more or less dirty in fact; in such cases adhesion is diminished or
destroyed, and the surface of the liquid next to such sides is virtually as free
as its upper surface.   Salt will be deposited there, other circumstances
being favourable, really from want of adhesion between the side and the
liquid that holds the salt in solution.       Now apply this to the case of a
so-called “ ndynamic,” “ non-catalytic,” or “inactive

cooled down below 60°. Supersaturated solutions of various saltswere cooled
down to various temperatures from 32° to 0° F. without crystallizing. Sodic
acetate, for example, was kept for some hours at 14°, when on touching it
with    a wire it became solid, and the temperature rose to 104°.                Sodic
arseniate, sodie succinate, sodie berate, sodio-potassic tartrate, potash alum,
and other saline solutions were treated in this way.           Some of these solu
tions become viscid at a low temperature, and do not immediately crys
tallize on removing the cotton-wool plug.             If they be touched, or the
side of the <U+FB02>ask scratched with a chemically clean wire, there is no ac
tion ; but if the wire be not chemically clean, the scratches immediately
become chalky white by being covered with minute crystals of the salt,
and the action then spreads until the solution becomes solid.
    Some salts that are not very soluble in water, such as the plumbic
acetate, form highly charged supersaturated solutions, and retain their
liquid state below ordinary atmospheric temperatures.           When at a certain
point they suddenly solidify. Other solutions merely deposit the excess
of salt above the condition of supersaturation, leaving the mother-liquor
saturated; the cupric sulphate is an example of this.
    The memoir contains a number of details respecting the action of nuclei,
 whether derived from the air, from the <U+FB02>ask, from the salt itself, from the
 <U+FB01>lter, or the cotton-wool   used in closing the vessels.     If the solution touch
 the wool, crystallization immediately sets in; or if the upper part ofa che
 mically clean tube be touched with a <U+FB01>nger slightly greasy before <U+FB01>ltering
 into it the hot solution, the latter will cool down to the temperature of the
 air without crystallizing,  nor will there be any effect if the tube be inclined
 so as to touch the clean portions of the inner surface; but the moment the
 solution comes upon the edge of the <U+FB01>nger-mark,             crystallization sets in,
 and the solution becomes solid.       Solutions not <U+FB01>ltered that begin to crys
 tallize at above   100° in open vessels,  or even in closed <U+FB02>asks, may by <U+FB01>ltra.
 tion   be freed from nuclei, and so cooled down in the latter to       low tempera
 tures without any separation of the salt.
     4. On the formation of a modi<U+FB01>ed salt—The readiness with which
 sodie sulphate parts with its water of crystallization, and two or three other
 considerations, make it more than probable that a solution of sodie sulphate
 at high temperatures is really a solution of the anhydrous salt. But M.
 Lowel supposes: that a supersaturated solution in cooling down below 60°
 assumes a new molecular constitution,       viz. that of the more soluble 7-atom
 hydrate which it then holds in solution.        The author gives an experiment
  to show that such cannot be the case, but that the solution continues to
 hold the anhydrous salt until    a portion  of it actually separates.     If a boiling
 solution of two parts salt to    one  part water be <U+FB01>ltered      into vessels   made
  chemically clean by being washed out with spirits of wine instead of sul
  phuric acid, and if these vessels, when cold, he placed in water at 32°, or
  from that to 40°, a few octohedral crystals of the anhydrous salt will be
  thrown down.       The temperature will slightly rise; and     if the   tube be now

408     Mr. C. Tomlinson        0n Supersaturated     Saline Solutions.      [May 28,
set aside in a moderately       warm air, the anhydrous salt will enter into solu
tion, forming a dense lower substratum, from which the 7-atom hydrate
will he produced in small quantity, there not being suf<U+FB01>cient water present
to form the ordinary lO-atom salt.          The rest of' the solution is still super
saturated, and     if the  plug be removed from the vessel,        crystallization   will
set  in from the surface and proceed rapidly downwards,                carrying down
enough    water  to   convert  the whole  solution, as  well  as the 7-atom,    into the
                                                                                          '
 lO-atom hydrate.
    This process may be conveniently watched in the case of the zinc sul
phate.      When    a saturated solution  of this salt cools down from the boiling
point to about 70°, the monohydrated salt is thrown down in quantity,
and, as the solution cools, a portion of this dissolves and a crop of acicular
crystals is produced which readily melt down at about 100°.              On removing
the cotton-wool from the tube, crystallization         sets in from the surface, and
the ordinary <U+FB01>-atom hydrate is produced.                     7
    The author examines M. Lowel’s experiments on solutions of the sodic
carbonate in which two modi<U+FB01>ed hydrates are pointed out, viz. the 7H 0 a
 and the 7H    0  b,  which differ in solubility from each other and from the 10
atom salt    ; but as   M. Lowel attaches great importance to the peculiar cata
lytic properties     of the sides of his vessels in determining the formation of
these   salts, the   author   cannot help thinking that M. Lo'wcl’s results were
due to portions of the sides of his vessel, not chemically clean, acting as
nuclei.     In chemically clean vessels M. LUWel’s results have not been re
produced ; for on reducing the temperature to a certain point depending on
the strength of the solution, the whole became suddenly solid, with a rise
in temperature of 35° or 40°. M. L6wel also points out two modi<U+FB01>cations
produced from supersaturated solutions of the magnesia sulphate.                    The
author has placed boiling saturated solutions, when cold, in freezing-mix
tures at 10° without producing any separation of the salt.
   The ammonia phosphate throws down from its supersaturated solution
an anhydrous powder, which, again entering into solution, forms a dense
lower stratum in which a modi<U+FB01>ed transparent crystallized salt is formed in
small quantity.
    The strontic nitrate     also deposits an anhydrous salt in cooling down to
about 62°; but       as this salt is not soluble in the solution, the modi<U+FB01>ed salt
is not formed.
   Some solutions on being cooled down in freezing—mixtures suddenly he
come solid; others freeze and sometimes thaw again without any separa
tion of the salt, as in the case of the cupric sulphate; but if a boiling
saturated solution of this salt be prepared with strict attention to chemical
purity, it may be cooled down to near 0° F. without any separation of the
salt.
   5. Anhydrous        Salts.-The    method adopted to ascertain whether an an
hydrous salt forms a supersaturated solution was to make a solution of
known strength, as indicated by some good Table of solubilities, raise it to

1868.]        Mr. C. Tomlinson           on Supersaturated Saline Solutions.             409
the boiling-point, and then note whether salt began to be thrown down
when the solution cooled down to the temperature indicated by the Table.
For  example, according to Poggiale’s Table, 100 parts of water at 158° will
dissolve 129'6 of sodic nitrate.  This is the same thing as 622'22 grains of
the salt in 1 ounce water.    Such a solution on cooling down from the boil
ing-point began to deposit salt at 160°.
   In like manner, according to Gay- Lussac’s Table, 100 parts of water at
 150° F. contain l25 of potassic nitrate.   A solution of 125 parts salt to'
 100 of water began to deposit salt at about 149°.   The deposit <U+FB01>rst began
to be made on the side nearest the window, or the coldest  side, when the
<U+FB02>ask was suspended in air; but if the <U+FB02>ask were placed on metal, or any
other good conductor, a ring of salt was <U+FB01>rst formed at the bottom, some
6° or 8° earlier than        if the    <U+FB02>ask stood on a block of wood.
   It has been frequently stated that the potassic bichromate forms asuper
saturated solution.  According to Kremer, 200 of water at 140° F. dissolve
100 parts of the salt.   Such a solution, on cooling from the boiling-point
began  to throw  down   crystalline <U+FB02>akes at 138°.  The remarkable deepen—
ing in colour of this solution under the in<U+FB02>uence of heat is pointed out.
     Sal-ammoniac,    potassic chlorate, and some other salts were also examined,
the conclusion being that anhydrous salts do not form supersaturated so
lutions.
   6. Conclusion and Summary—The author refers to the prevailing theory
that supersaturation exists in appearance only and not in fact, since it is
supposed to be the modi<U+FB01>ed and more soluble salt that is in solution.      If
this were true, it ought to apply to all cases of supersaturation, and it has
only been claimed in the case of a very few salts, and in them much im
portance has been attached to the active or the inactive condition of the
sides of the vessels containing the solutions.
   The author, while admitting, in the case of a very few solutions, that a
modi<U+FB01>ed salt may be deposited, denies that it is due to any molecular change
that takes place in the solution, either from reduction of temperature or
any catalytic property of the sides of the vessel. His theory is that when
these modi<U+FB01>ed salts are formed, it is the anhydrous salt that is held in so
lution, aportion of which is thrown down as the temperature falls; and
this anhydrous deposit, entering again into solution, forms a dense substra
tum containing lcss water than the upper portions, so that when the modi
<U+FB01>ed salt forms in      it,  out of the reach of suf<U+FB01>cient water to form the
                             it   is
normal   salt. When,    on  the contrary, under the in<U+FB02>uence of      nucleus,     a
crystallization    sets in from the surface,       the normal   salt   is   formed,   and the
crystals carry down suf<U+FB01>cient water to convert the whole into the ordinary
hydrated salt.
     As                       or the sides of the vessel, when chemically
          to the action of nuclei
clean the solution adheres to them as    whole, and there
                                                  a          no separation  is
of the salt; when not chemically clean there    stronger adhesion between
                                                       isa
the salt and the nucleus than between the salt and the solvent, and there

4-10     Mr. C. Tomlinson    0n .S'upcrsaluralcll   Saline Solutions.    [May 28,
is a separation of salt; and the action of separation once begun, may be
rapidly propagated throughout the whole solution.           Boiling saturated solu
tions may be cooled down in chemically clean vessels and kept for any length
 of time, not because they undergo any molecular change or hold a salt of
 greater solubility than the normal salt in solution, but they retain their
 <U+FB02>uid form simply from the absence of a nucleus.

   Suppose that we have two rigid cylinders of equal dimensions, which have
their axes in the same straight line; suppose, also, that one of the cylin
ders is at rest while the other moves towards the <U+FB01>rst with the velocity V
in a direction parallel to both the axes; the consequence of the collision
which under such circumstances must take place, will manifestly be that
half the momentum of the moving cylinder will be withdrawn from         and         it,
will be transferred to the cylinder which originally was at rest.
   The mode in which velocity or momentum will thus be collected from
the different parts of the one cylinder, and distributed amongst those of
the other,     is         Exactly the same amount will be withrawn from
                    obvious.
the velocity of each particle of the impinging cylinder, and exactly the
same amount of velocity will be impressed on each particle of the cylinder
struck.
   And the reason of this        equally obvious
                                    is               since, ;  such were not the
                                                                    if
case, the particles of each cylinder would contract—a supposition which                    is
forbidden by the very de<U+FB01>nition of rigidity.
   But   if,
           instead of being perfectly rigid, each cylinder        in the slightest
                                                                          is
degree compressible,     variation
                               a    in  the effect will occur.
   As before, momentum of <U+FB01>nite amount will be transferred from the one
cylinder to the other, but the mode. of collection of the velocity withdrawn
from the one, and the mode of distribution of that injected into the other,
will   no longer be the same as before.

412           Mr. R. Moon         on the Impact               of   Compressible           Bodies.        [May 28,
    Inorder that the moving cylinder may not be reduced to absolute rest
by the collision, it is obvious that the cylinder originally at rest, or a
portion of         it,
               must be moved out of the way, so as to allow of the con
tinuance, even in          a  degree, of the other’s motion; and this can
                               modi<U+FB01>ed
only be effected on the terms  of   transference of velocity or momentum
                                                     a
taking place from the one cylinder, or part of     to the other cylinder, or
                                                                           it,
part of it.
   But when the cylinders are compressible, we are freed from two condi
tions which obtain when the cylinders are rigid.
    In the     <U+FB01>rst place,     it   is   no longer necessary to suppose, neither should we
be justi<U+FB01>ed in assuming, that the velocity abstracted from each particle of
the impinging cylinder, or transferred to each particle of the cylinder
struck,    the same; on the'contrary, all experience tells us that, in bodies
              is
susceptible to compression, compression       always produced       collision;
                                                                   is                               by
in other   words, that variation of velocity, in the parts about   which   the
collision      takes place,         is   the       immediate        and    invariable         concomitant      of
collision.
‘  In the second place, when the cylinders are compressible,     no longer                     it   is
essential to suppose that the e<U+FB01>'ect of the collision will be to withdraw
velocity from every particle of the impinging cylinder, and to impart velo
city    every particle of the cylinder struck.
       to                                          Undoubtedly such may be
the case   the cylinders are short,
              if                       they are possessed of only
                                                      if            moderate                        a
degree  of rigidity,  and    the     if
                                  velocity  before impact  of the  impinging
cylinder   considerable.
              is           But      the cylinders be long, while the velocity
                                               if
of the impinging cylinder      of moderate amount, the contrary may
                                              is
occur.  The condition that the cylinder originally at rest shall not oppose
an immediate             insurmountable            barrier     even       to the      modi<U+FB01>ed        motion    of
the other may, obviously,                 be suf<U+FB01>ciently            satis<U+FB01>ed     motion of contrac
                                                                                 if   a
tion    imparted
         is                  by
                     the collision                       to    a    de<U+FB01>nite portion of the second
cylinder.
  But when the cylinders are compressible, equallyas when they are rigid,
the collision           the instantaneous abstraction of velocity or mo
                     must cause
mentum, either from the whole of the impinging cylinder, or from     de<U+FB01>                                   a
nite part of    and the instantaneous communication of the velocity so
                     it,
withdrawn, either to the whole of the cylinder struck, or to de<U+FB01>nite part                     a
of it.
   We have hitherto assumed the velocity of each particle of the impinging
cylinder to have been originally uniform.    Let us now suppose, however,
that immediately before impact       counter velocity of variable amount
                                                    a                                                          is
impressed on the different parts of the impinging body, so that, at the
instant of impact, before taking account of the feet of collision, the velo
city at any point of the impinging body may be expressed by V— V,;
where    V   constant, but
              is             has the value zero at the surface of collision,
                                         Vl
and thence gradually increases as we recede towards the other extremity
of the cylinder, so that V—Vl, which expresses the velocity of the im

1868.]        Mr. R. Moon      on the Impact   of  Compressible Bodies.      443
pinging cylinder before impact, has its greatest value at the surface of col
lision, and diminishes as we recede therefrom.
    It  is clear that, in the case we are now considering, the collective m0
mentum       abstracted from the impinging cylinder by the collision will be
less, and <U+FB01>nitely less, than that which was abstracted by the collision in
the former case, in which the velocity of each particle of the impinging
cylinder was supposed uniform and equal to V.
    For,   if M  be the momentum       lost by collision when the velocity before
impact is uniform and equal           to V, it is clear that when the velocity
before impact is represented by V—Vl, the quantity Vl may be such that
the'momentum before impact may be <U+FB01>nitely less than M ; from which it
follows inevitably that the amount of momentum lost by collision in this
latter case must be less than M.
    Let us now vary the data by supposing that the velocity before impact
increases instead of diminishes as we recede from the surface of collision ;
so that at the moment of impact, before taking account of the effects of
 collision, the velocity at any point of the impinging cylinder is represented
by V-l-V1 instead of V—V,.
    It is clear that the momentum abstracted by the collision in this latter
case will be greater, and <U+FB01>nitely greater, than in the case where the velo
 city before impact is nniform and equal to V. Let the additional momen-.
 tum abstracted in this case be M,, the whole momentum so abstracted
 being represented by M-l-Ml.
    Let us now make a <U+FB01>nal variation in the conditions of the problem, by.
 supposing that at the moment of impact, and irrespective of the impact, a
 ve10city equal and opposite to V is communicated to each particle of the
impinging cylinder, so that at that instant, without taking account of
 any action of the one cylinder upon the other, the velocities of the two
 cylinders along their surfaces of contact will be equal, or, rather, will be
alike zero; at the same time that at every other point of the impinging
 cylinder there will be a variable velocity V1 increasing in amount as we
recede from the surface of contact.
    In estimating the effect of the cylinders being in contact under the cir
 cumstances last described, it is clear that the abstraction from each particle
 of the impinging body of the velocityV can only be regarded as preventing
 the transference to the second cylinder of so much of the momentum
 M-FMl as that velocity, if it had constituted the-entire velocity before
 impact of the impinging body, would have given rise to, viz. M; and that
 the momentum       Ml, whose appearance in the expression M+M1 is due to
 the fact of     the <U+FB01>rst cylinder having been originally endowed with the
 variable velocity V1 in addition to the constant velocity V, will still con
 tinne to be transmitted     to the second cylinder from the <U+FB01>rst.
    We are thus led to this ingular and, doubtless, pregnant conclusion,
that in a continuous material system in which there is neither discon
tinuity of velocity nor discontinuity of density, all the consequences of

collision may occur, viz. the instantaneous transmission of a <U+FB01>nite amount
of' momentum from one part of the system to another, provided we have
discontinuity in the tendency to COMPTQSSiO<U+FB01> in the different parts of the
system.
    The author has endeavoured, in former communications to the Royal So
ciety, to show that when the velocity in a <U+FB02>uid diminishes in the direction
to which the motion tends, the slower particles will offer a resistance to the
motion of the faster particles, which the received theory fails to take into
account.     The foregoing speculation goes to prove that the circumstance
of the surfaces of contact of contiguous elements of the <U+FB02>uid having the
same velocity, constitutes no objection to the reality of such resistance.

    The object of this paper is to exhibit the phenomena of diurnal inequality
in the tides on the coasts of India, and describe the mode adopted by the
author    for obtaining formulae based on astronomical elements for predict
ing them.     It is accompanied by the following records of observations given
in a diagram form      :—
                     Kurrachee,  1857—8,   December to March.
                         ,,       1865,    March to August.
                         ,,       1867,    The whole year.
                     Bombay       1867,    February to May.
    The height and times predicted by the author for 1867, and published
 by the India Of<U+FB01>ce, are given on the diagrams for that year, so that they
 may be compared with actual observation.
    The continuous curves of the height of the water taken at Bombay, at
 every ten minutes for the four months above named, are also given.
    By the rotation of the earth every meridian-line is brought twice a day
 under the in<U+FB02>uences which ultimately result in the well-known semidiur
 nal tidal  movements—once       when in the position nearest to the attracting
 body, and once when in that furthest from it.          But the actual point in
 that meridian which is in the centre of those influences will be alternately
 north and south of the equator, to the extent of the declination of the
 attracting body.      This alternation of the position of the centre of attrac
 tion from the northern to the southern hemisphere produces a diurnal
 tide, and that diurnal tide produces a diurnal inequality in the semidiurnal
 tide

   The character of the diurnal tide and the highly complex conditions
under which its constantly varying solar and lunar component parts are
combined are then traced.      Being entirely dependent on the dcclinations
of the   sun and moon,    the solar element vanishes    twice a year, and the
lunar element twice a month, each reappearing after the solar or lunar
equinox, with its times of high and low water reversed.
   The diurnal tide produces a diurnal inequality in height and time of
high and low water, a<U+FB01>'ecting simultaneously respectively high-water time
and low-water height, and high—water height and low-water time.         In par
ticular cases, the actual values of height and time of diurnal tide may be
directly deduced from the values of diurnal inequality. From these it
was found that diurnal tide     follows   the moon’s   movements    at a much
shorter interval than semidiurnal,   the retard of the former being from two
to three hours only, while that of the latter is from thirty-four to thirty
six hours.                                                                '
   The mode adopted for identifying the varying values of diurnal inequa
lity with their physical causes was then explained. A hypothetical series
of diurnal tides, based on the varying values of the declination of the sun
and moon, was calculated, the necessary local constants being deduced from
the particular cases in which their values could be directly obtained. These
hypothetical diurnal tides being combined with a series of semidiurnal tides
deduced from the diagram of observations, the diurnal inequalities so obtained
were compared with the actual diurnal inequalities.    It was then found that
a further element was wanting, which was approximately and provisionally
obtained by the introduction of a second empirical diurnal lunar tide of
twelve inches maximum half-range at Bombay, and six inches at Kurra
chee.     This tide was assumed, like the <U+FB01>rst and principal diurnal tide, to
be dependent on the moon’s declination, but to vanish at intervals of two
or three days, before the moon crossed the equator.      The author expresses
an opinion that this empirical correction might probably be superseded by
one more consistent with physical causes, if more extended and more
correct observations were subjected to investigation.
    Lastly, the comparison of calculated heights and times with the records
of   observations for four months at Bombay and eight months at Kurra—
chec were given.      This showed that three calculated tides out of four
were correct within three inches in height and <U+FB01>fteen minutes in time, the
errors of the remainder ranging up to nine inches in height, and thirty
minutes in time.
   Since receiving the observations made at Bombay and Kurrachee in the
year 1867 the author has subjected them to another process for obtaining
the actual times and heights of diurnal tide, which has been more suc
cessful than that described in the paper.
   The only data made use of were the diurnal inequalities in height at
high and low water, the range of semidiurnal tide and the diurnal ine—

 quality    in time, which were necessary to the previous process, being now
 altogether disregarded.
   The diurnal inequalities in height were obtained by measuring the widths
of the brown spaces where they were crossed by the vertical lines repre
senting noon on successive days.    The two daily values thus obtained are
respectively the sine and cosine of an angle which represents the difference
in time between semidiurnal and diurnal tide.    Dividing the low-water by
the high-water value gives the cotangent of that angle, and thence the
angle itself. Thus the time of' actual diurnal tide (<U+FB01>rst in relation to the
time of semidiurnal             low water,   and then in relation to solar time)        was
obtained.
   The actual range of diurnal tide was obtained by adding together the
squares of the high-water and low~watcr values (sine and cosine), and
taking the square root of the sum.
   With these two series of results as ordinates, curves were drawn repre
senting times and ranges of actual diurnal tide, which were thus presented
in a convenient form for comparison with the diurnal tide which had been
previously       calculated.
   The comparison            con<U+FB01>rmed     the previous    conclusion    that the tide based
on the simple declination theory was insuf<U+FB01>cient, and the empirical correc
tion which had been adopted seemed to provide an approximation       to the
required addition to     both in time and height.
                               it,                  But    appeared that a
                                                                        it
better coincidence in time would have been obtained by assuming the diur
nal tide at Kurrachee to be forty minutes earlier.   This supposition was
tested by treating the observations of 1865 in  similar manner, and also
                                                            a
by recalculating    portion of the tides of 1867 with the earlier diurnal
                       a
tide.   In both cases the supposition was con<U+FB01>rmed,     better agreement
                                                                       a
being  obtained.
   On treating the Bombay observations in the same manner,       fair generala
coincidence  with the calculated diurnal tides was found to exist; but                      it
was further found, on comparing together the Kurrachee and Bombay
curves of actual diurnal tide (thus for the <U+FB01>rst time recorded for the same
period), that the times were nearly identical at the two ports, and the
range at Bombay about one-tenth greater than that at Kurrachee.
  The tables for the four months over which the Bombay observations ex
tend were recalculated   with the diurnal tides which had been calculated
for Kurrachee  (but  made   forty minutes earlier, and increased in range by
one-tenth), and  the result was quite as good as that shown by the original
tables.  This fact would seem to point to the possibility that the diurnal
tide   is   a   vertical    nndnlation,   acting   simultaneously,     or nearly so, over   a
large area.

420       Prof. E. Frankland      on the Combustion    of Hydrogen     [June 11,
the presence of solid particles.      In reference to gas- and candle-<U+FB02>ames, it is
now well known that the fuliginous matter produced when a piece of wire
gauze is depressed upon such <U+FB02>ames, and the sooty deposit which coats a
piece of white porcelain placed in a similar position, are not pure carbon,
but contain    hydrogen, which is only completely got rid of by prolonged
exposure    to a white heat in an atmosphere of chlorine.       On pursuing the
subject   further,  I found    that  there   are many  <U+FB02>ames   possessing a high
degree of luminosity which cannot possibly contain solid particles.         Thus
the <U+FB02>ame of metallic arsenic burning in oxygen emits a remarkably intense
white light; and as metallic arsenic volatilizes at 180° C., and its pro
duct of combustion (arsenious anhydride)          at 218° C., whilst the tempe
rature of incandescence of solids is at least 500° C., it is obviously im
possible here to assume the presence of ignited solid particles in the <U+FB02>ame.
Again, if carbonic disulphide vapour be made to burn in oxygen, or oxygen
in carbonic disulphide vapour, an almoet insupportably brilliant light is
the result.     Now fuliginous matter is never present in any part of this
<U+FB02>ame, and the boiling-point of sulphur (440° C.) is below the temperature
of incandescence, so that the assumption of solid particles in the <U+FB02>ame is
here also inadmissible.      If  the last experiment be varied by the substitu
tion of nitric oxide   gas for oxygen, the result is still the same; and the
 dazzling light produced by the combustion of these compounds is also so
rich in the more refrangible rays, that it has been employedin taking instan
taneous photographs, and for exhibiting the phenomena of <U+FB02>uorescence.
    Many other similar cases of the production of brilliant light from incan
descent, gaseous, or vaporous matter might be cited; but I will mention
only one other.      Amongst the chemical reactions celebrated for the pro
duction of dazzling light, there are few which surpass the active combustion
of phosphorus in oxygen.           Now phosphoric anhydride, the product of
this combustion, is volatile at a red heat; and it is therefore manifestly im
possible that this substance should cxist in the solid form at the tempera
ture of the phosphorus-<U+FB02>ame, which far transcends the melting-point of
platinum. For these reasons, and for others stated in the lectures above
 quoted,  I  consider that incandescent particles of carbon are not the source
 of light in gas- and candle-<U+FB02>ames, but that the luminosity of these <U+FB02>ames is
due to radiations from dense but transparent hydrocarbon vapours.           As a
further generalization from the experiment above mentioned, I was led to
 the conclusion that dense gases and vapours become luminous at much
lower temperatures than aériform <U+FB02>uids of comparatively low speci<U+FB01>c
gravity, and that this result is to a great extent, if not altogether, inde
pendent of the nature of the gas or vapour, inasmuch as I found that
gases of low density, which are not luminous at a given temperature when
burnt under common atmospheric pressure, become so when they are
simultaneously compressed.          Thus mixtures of hydrogen and carbonic
oxide with oxygen emit but little light when they are burnt or exploded
in free air, but exhibit intense luminosity when exploded in closed glass
vessels, so as to prevent their expansion at the moment of combustion.

    1868.]       ana7 Carbonic Oxide in Oxygen under great pressure.           421
      I have   recently extended these experiments to the combustion of jets of
   hydrogen     and carbonic oxide in oxygen under a pressure gradually in
   creasing to twenty atmospheres.        These experiments were conducted in a
   strong iron vessel, furnished with a thick plate of glass of sufficient size to
   permit of the optical examination of the <U+FB02>ame.           The results are so re
   markable that, although still far from being complete, I venture to com
   municate them to the Royal Society before the close of the Session.        The
   appearance of a jet of hydrogen burning in oxygen under the ordinary
  atmospheric pressure is too well known to need description.              On in
  creasing the pressure to two atmospheres, the previously feeble luminosity
  is very visibly augmented, whilst at ten atmospheres’
                                                               pressure the light
  emitted by a jet about 1 inch long is amply sufficient to enable the
  observer to read a newspaper at a distance of 2 feet from the <U+FB02>ame, and
  this without any re<U+FB02>ecting      surface behind    the <U+FB02>ame.   Examined by the
  spectroscope, the spectrum      of Mia/lame is bright  and perfectly continuous
 from red to violet.
     With   a  higher initial luminosity,  the <U+FB02>ame of carbonic oxide in oxygen
  becomes much        more luminous    at a pressure of ten atmospheres than a
  <U+FB02>ame of hydrogen of the same size and burning under the same
                                                                         pressure.
  The spectrum of carbonic oxide burning in air is well known to be con
 tinuous; burnt in oxygen under a pressure of fourteen atmospheres, the
 spectrum of the <U+FB02>ame is very brilliant, and perfectly continuous.
     If it be true that dense gases emit more light than rare ones when
 ignited, the passage of the electric spark through different gases ought to
 produce an amount of light varying with the density of the gas; and this
 is in fact the case, for electric sparks passed as nearly as possible under
 similar conditions through hydrogen, oxygen, chlorine, and sulphurous
 anhydride emit light the intensity of which is very slight in the case of
 hydrogen, considerable in that of oxygen, and very great in the case of
 chlorine and sulphurous anhydride.           When lique<U+FB01>ed sulphurous anhy
 dride is sealed up in a strong tube furnished with platinum wires, and the
 temperature then allowed to rise until the internal pressure amounts to
 three or four atmospheres, the passage of induction-sparks          through the
 enclosed gas is attended with very brilliant <U+FB02>ashes of light.      Further, if a
 stream of induction-sparks      be passed through air con<U+FB01>ned in a glass tube
 connected with a condensing syringe, and the pressure of the air be gradu
ally augmented to two or three atmospheres, a very marked increase in the
luminosity of the sparks is observed, whilst on allowing the condensed air
to escape,    the same phenomena are observed in the reverse order.
    The electric are from <U+FB01>fty cells of Grove’s battery is incomparably more
brilliant when mercury vapour, instead of atmospheric air, is interposed
in the path of the discharge between the carbon points. The gases and
vapours just mentioned have the following relative densities      :—

                                  Hydrogen Gas by Metals.”
    GRAHAM, F.R.S., Master of the Mint.               Received May 22, 1868.
    In   my experiments,    already published, on the occlusion of hydrogen by
 the metals palladium,      platinum, and iron, the absorption of the gas was
 observed to be of uncertain        occurrence    at low temperatures, but was
 ensured by heating      the metal, whether     in the form of sponge or aggre
 gated by hammering,       and allowing it    to cool slowly and completely in a
 hydrogen atmosphere.         This fact was referred to the condition of absolute
 purity of the metallic surface being essential to the <U+FB01>rst absorbing action,
 as  it is to the action of platinum-foil or wire in determining the combus
 tion of the gaseous mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, as observed by Fara
 day.     A new method of charging the metals with hydrogen at low tem
 peratures has lately presented itself, which is not without interest.
     When a plate of zinc is placed in dilute sulphuric acid, hydrogen is
 freely evolved from the surface of the metal, but no hydrogen is occluded
 and retained at the same time.          A negative result was indeed to be ex
 pected from the crystalline structure of zinc.         But a thin plate of palla
 dium immersed in the same acid, and brought into metallic contact with
 the zinc, soon becomes largely charged with the hydrogen, which is then
 transferred to its surface.     The charge taken up in an hour by a palladium
  plate, rather thick, at 12° amounted to 173 times its volume.
     The absorption of hydrogen was still more obvious when the palladium
  plate was constituted the negative electrode in acidulated water to a
  Bunsen battery of six cells.      The evolution of oxygen gas at the positive
  electrode continuing copious, the c<U+FB01>'ervesceuce at the negative electrode
  was entirely suspended for the <U+FB01>rst twenty seconds, in consequence of the
  hydrogen being occluded by the palladium.          The <U+FB01>nal absorption amounted
  to 200'4 volumes, and was greater in amount than the volume of hydrogen
  occluded by the same plate heated and cooled in an atmosphere of the
  gas, which did not exceed 90 volumes.
     It is worthy of remark that, although         the hydrogen enters the palla
  dium and no doubt pervades the whole mass of the metal in such circum
  stances, the gas exhibits no disposition to leave the metal and escape into a
  vacuum, at the temperature of its absorption.          Thus a thin plate of pal
  ladium,    charged with hydrogen in the manner described, was washed,
  dried by a cloth, and then sealed up in an exhausted glass tube.              On

 1868.]                        Hydrogen Gas by Metals.                                 42-3
breaking the tube under mercury after two months, the vacuum was found
perfect.       No hydrogen had vaporized in the cold (about 12°) ; but on
the application afterwards of a heat of 100° and upwards, 333 volumes of
gas were evolved from the metal.
      A similar result was obtained on making a hollow palladium cylinder, of
which the length was         115 millimetres, diameter 12 millimetres, and thick
ness     1 millimetre,   the negative electrode in an acid <U+FB02>uid, while the closed
cavity of the cylinder was kept exhausted by means of a Sprengel aspi
rator.      No hydrogen whatever passed through into the vacuous cavity in
several hours, although the gas was no doubt abundantly absorbed by the
outer surface of the cylinder and pervaded the metal throughout.
      It appears, then, that when hydrogen        is absorbed by palladium the vola
tility of the gas may be entirely suppressed; and hydrogen may be largely
present in metals without exhibiting any sensible tension at low tempera
tures.      Occluded    hydrogen   is certainly no longer a gas, whatever may he
thought of its physical condition.           The same conclusion was indicated by
another series of experiments, in which it was found that, to be occluded
by palladium, and even by iron, hydrogen does not require to be applied
under much pressure, but, on the contrary, when highly rare<U+FB01>ed is still
freely absorbed by these metals.
     The occluded hydrogen is readily extracted from palladium by reversing
the position of the latter in the decomposing cell of the battery, so as to
cause oxygen to be evolved on the surface of the metal.                The hydrogen is
then drawn        out as rapidly as it had previously entered the palladium, and
the metal is exhausted in a complete manner by such treatment.                      When
palladium charged with hydrogen is left exposed to the atmosphere, the
metal is apt to become suddenly hot, and to lose its gas entirely by spon
taneous oxidation.
     Platinum may be charged with hydrogen by voltaic action, as well as
palladium, but with the usual- inferior proportion of gas.                  The charge
of hydrogen taken up in a decomposing voltaic cell by old platinum in the
form of a tube, of the thickness of a small crucible, was 2'19 volumes.
This absorbed gas was also readily withdrawn from the platinum and
oxidized on reversing the place of the metal in the decomposing cell. The
platinum acquired its well-known polarizing-power                 in virtue of the oc
cluded hydrogen.           This power was retained by the metal after being
washed with pure water and wiped with a cloth, and was brought into
action on placing the metal in dilute acid.             The temperature required to
expel the hydrogen so absorbed by platinum             was  found to be little short of
a red heat, although the gas had entered the metal at a low temperature.

     Soft iron, left some time in a dilute acid, occluded 0'57 volume 0f
hydrogen.        This charge of gas was also retained at low temperatures, and
did not     escape into a vacuum     till the temperature was raised nearly           red
                                                                                   to
ness.      This proves that, like platinum, iron     is not penetrated through      in  the
cold by hydrogen, the temperature of emission being elevated considerably *.

    While hydrogen       was absorbed freely by palladium and platinum as
negative plates, no oxygen whatever was absorbed by plates of the same
metals in the position of positive electrodes.          Oxygen gas was disengaged
freely on the surface of the latter without being condensed.               A platinum
plate which     had  acted  for  several hours  as a positive  electrode,   gave after
wards, when submitted to heat          with   exhaustion,  a small   trace of  carbonic
acid but no oxygen.
    The familiar igniting-power of platinum sponge (or clean plate) upon a
jet of hydrogen in the air seems to depend solely upon the in<U+FB02>uence of the
metal upon its occluded hydrogen.           The hydrogen appears to be polarized,
 and to have its attraction       for oxygen greatly heightened.         I beg to offer
 the following representation of this phenomenon,            with  an  apology for the
purely speculative character of the explanation.            The gaseous molecule of
hydrogen      being assumed to be an association of two atoms, a hydride of
hydrogen, it would follow that it is the attraction of platinum for the
                “ chlorylous” atom of the hydrogen molecule which attaches
negative or
 the latter to the metal.       The tendency, imperfectly satis<U+FB01>ed, is to the for
mation of a hydride of platinum.             The hydrogen molecule is accordingly
                                                “ basylous” side turned outwards,
 polarized, orienté, with its positive or
 and having its af<U+FB01>nity for oxygen greatly enlivened.              It is true that the
 two atoms of a molecule of hydrogen are considered to be inseparable; but
 this may not be inconsistent with the replacement of such hydrogen atoms
 as are withdrawn,      on combining with oxygen, by other hydrogen atoms
from the adjoining molecules.          It is only necessary to suppose that a pair
of contiguous hydrogen molecules act together upon a single molecule of
the external oxygen.         They would form water, and still leave a pair of
atoms, or a single molecule of hydrogen, attached to the platinum.
    The oxidation of alcohol, ether, and similar hydrocarbons, through the
 agency of platinum, likewise appears to be always an immediate conse
 quence of a similar polarization of the hydrogen of these substances, or of
 some other oxidable constituent.
    As has already    been   remarked,    it  does not follow that, because       a gas
 is occluded     by a metal, under the pressure       of the atmosphere, at a low
 temperature, the gas will also escape from the metal into a vacuum at
 the same temperature, a much higher temperature being often required for
 the expulsion of the gas than for its <U+FB01>rst absorption.           This is particularly
 true of carbonic oxide occluded by iron. Cast iron is much too porous for
 such experiments, and allows carbonic oxide, equally with other gases, to
pass through abundantly by the agency of gaseous di<U+FB01>‘usion.                  Even with
 malleable iron there is a ditliculty in observing, owing to the long time
 during which that metal continues to discharge carbonic oxide from its
 own store of that gas.         But a malleable iron tube, <U+FB01>rst thoroughly de
 prived of its natural gas, was found to allow carbonic oxide to pass through
 is no doubt penetrated through by hydrogen in the cold, but apparently from the
 penetrating agency of the acid which is insinuating itself into the metal at the same
 time.-—Comptea   Rendus, 4 Mai 1868,

  volume of carbonic oxide which the metal is capable of absorbing is very
  sensible, amounting to 4 volumes, and more considerable than the volume
  of  hydrogen which the same metal can occlude.              Carbonic oxide did not
  sensibly pass through iron of 1'7 millimetre         in thickness till the tempera

     The condition of hydrogen as occluded by a colloidal metal may be
  studied with most advantage in its union with palladium, where the pro
  portion of gas held is considerable.        In the pulverulent spongy state, pal
  ladium took up 655 volumes of hydrogen; and so charged it gave 05' no
 gas    in menu at the ordinary temperature, nor till its temperature was
  raised    to nearly 100°.     Hammered palladium foil has been observed to
 take up quite as much gas. But the condition in which palladium appears
 to be most absorptive is when precipitated from a solution of about 1'6
 per cent. of the chloride, by the action of a voltaic battery, in the form of
 a compact metal.        Palladium is not one of the metals readily thus preci
 pitated ; but it may be thrown down upon a thin platinum wire, in bril
 liant laminae, by the action of a large single cell. The palladium after a
 time detaches itself from the wire, exhibiting a bright white metallic sur
 face where it had been in contact with the platinum, and a dull surface,
suggesting metallic arsenic, on the side exposed to the acid.                 As so pre
pared, it does not contain any occluded hydrogen.             But the metallic <U+FB01>lms,
when heated to 100° in hydrogen, and allowed to cool slowly for an hour
in the same gas, were found to occlude 982'14 volumes of gas, measured
with thermometer at 11°, and barometer at 756 millimetres.                   This is the
largest absorption of hydrogen observed.              From palladium so charged
there was a slight indication of the escape of hydrogen into avacuum,
with extreme slowness in the cold. This charged palladium is represented
by weight       as

     It  is in the proportion of one equivalent of palladium to 0'772 equiva
lent     of  hydrogenit, or there is an approximation to single equivalents
 Pd H. But the idea of definite chemical combination is opposed by
various considerations.         No visible change is occasioned to the metallic
palladium by its association with the hydrogen.                 Hydrides of certain
metals are known, as the hydride of copper (W urtz) and the hydride of
iron (Wanklyn) ; but they are brown pulverulent substances with no me

tallic characters.      Indeed a hydride of palladium itself can be formed, but
not preserved, on account of its great instability.         Following the process
of M. \Vurtz for the hydride of copper, nitrate of palladium was boiled
with sulphuric acid, and the sulphate of palladium (a red crystalline salt) pre
pared. A solution of this salt, with an excess of sulphuric acid, was precipi
 tated by the hypophosphite of soda ; a black powder fell, which speedily un
 derwent decomposition at 0°, evolving copious volumes of hydrogen gas. The
 <U+FB01>nal residue appeared to be pure palladium, of its usual black amorphous
 appearance, and with no trace of crystallization.          It is singular that this
 palladium precipitate       contained  no  occluded  hydrogen;     and even when
 heated, and afterwards exposed to        an atmosphere  of  hydrogen in the usual
 manner,       the palladium   black so prepared   condensed no sensible quantity
  of that gas.
      I  am inclined to conclude that the passage of hydrogen through a plate
  of metal is always preceded by the condensation or occlusion of the gas.
  But it must be admitted that the rapidity of penetration is not in propor
  tion to the volume of gas occluded ; otherwise palladium would be much
  more permeable at a low than at a high temperature.                A plate of that
  metal was sensibly exhausted of hydrogen gas at 267°, but continued per
  meable,      and in fact increased greatly in permeability at still higher tem—
  peratures, and without becoming permeable to other gases at the same
  time.     In a striking experiment, a mixture of equal volumes of hydrogen
  and carbonic acid was carried through a small palladium tube, of which
  the internal diameter was 3 millimetres, and the thickness of the wall
  0'3 millimetre.         From the outer surface of this tube     gas escaped  into a
  vacuum, at a red heat, with the enormous velocity of 101754 cub. centims.
  per minute for a square metre of surface.        This gas did not disturb baryta
  water.      It  was pure hydrogen.
       A still  more rapid passage of hydrogen was observed through the sub
   stance of a hollow cylinder of palladium l millimetre in thickness, at a
   higher temperature, approaching the melting-point of gold.             The palla
   dium cylinder being enclosed in a porcelain tube charged with pure
   hydrogen, was exhausted as usual, and gave 105'8 cub. centims of gas in
   <U+FB01>ve minutes; measured with bar. 753 millims., therm. 10°. As the external
   surface of the palladium tube amounted to 00053 square metre, the passage
    of gas was
          399 2'22 cub. centims. from a square metre of surface, per minute.
        The rate of penetration of hydrogen through the same. palladium tube,
   at the lower temperature of 265° C., was previously observed to be
            327 cub. centims. from a square metre of surface, per minute.
        The velocity of penetration thus appears to increase in a rapid ratio with
    the temperature.
        When carbonic      acid was substituted for hydrogen, at the same        high
    temperature, a very minute penetration was perceived, amounting to
            1'86 cub. centim. from a square metre of surface, per minute.

     This    gives for carbonic acid one twenty-thousandth part of the rate of
hydrogen. \Vhether it is a penetration of the same sort, although greatly
less in degree, or rather the consequence of a sensible porosity in the
palladium (of which it would become the measure), remains uncertain.
     The quantity of hydrogen held by the metal at these high tempera
tures may become too small to be appreciated;                       but I presume it is still
present, and travels through the metal by akind of rapid cementation.
This extreme mobility is a singular property of hydrogen, which was in
 volved in the fundamental discovery, by MM. H. Sainte-Claire Deville and
 Troost, of the passage of that gas through plates of iron and platinum at
 high temperatures.
      The marked rapidity of the passage of the                   same   gas through a thin
sheet     of  caoutchouc appears to be more capable of explanation                  on known
principles.       Caoutehouc of less than 0'1 millimetre in thickness,             if impreg
 nated with hydrogen, loses its gas entirely by the most momentary expo
 sure to the air.          A tube of 2 millimetres in thickness, through which
 hydrogen and carbonic            acid were singly passed, each for             an hour, was
 found to retain—
                Of  hydrogen . . .   . . . . . .  ...........     0-0113 volume.
                Of  carbonic acid      ................           0'2200     ,,
 The absorption, then, is in the proportion of 1 hydrogen to 20 carbonic
 acid; but the comparative rate of penetration of the two gases through a
  sheet of caoutchouc is as 1 hydrogen to 2%— earbonic acid ; or the hydro
 gen moves eight times as rapidly as the density of its solution would
  indicate.       But these gases differ in di<U+FB01>'usibility as carbonic acid 1 to
  hydrogen 4'7.          The rapid passage of hydrogen through caoutchouc is
  thus partly explained by the rapid manner in which that gas is brought to
  one surface of the sheet and conveyed away from the other by gaseous
  di<U+FB01>'usion.       Again, both substances travel through the substance of the
 eaoutehouc by their ditfusibility as liquids.                   Suppose hydrogen in that
  form to     be  nearly as much      more       di<U+FB01>'usive  than the other substance as it is
   when both are gaseous,           then the observed rapid passage of hydrogen
   through eaoutehoue would appear to be fully accounted for.
       Liquid di<U+FB01>'usion has also a bearing upon the rapid dissemination of
   hydrogen through a soft colloid metal, like palladium or platinum, at a
   high temperature.         The liquid diffusion of salts in water is known to be
   six times as rapid at 100° as at 0°.                   If the di<U+FB01>'usion of liquid hydro
   gen increases with temperature in an equal ratio, it must become a very
   rapid movement at         a. red heat.         Although the quantity absorbed may be
   reduced      (or  the  channel    narrowed), the <U+FB02>ow of liquid may thus be in
   creased     in  velocity.    The whole phenomena appear to be consistent with
    the solution of liquid hydrogen in the colloid metal.                     The “solution
    af<U+FB01>nity” of metals appears to be nearly con<U+FB01>ned to hydrogen and car
   bonic oxide, so that metals are not sensibly penetrated by other gases than
    these.

          SCLATER, Esq., M.A., Ph.D.  Received May 6, 1868.
                                       (Abstract)
    The Solitaire of Rodriguez was <U+FB01>rst satisfactorily shown to be distinct
 from the Dodo of Mauritius (Didus ineptua) by Strickland in 1844, from
 a renewed examination of the evidence respecting          consisting of the ac

 count given by Leguat      in  1708, and  of the remains   sent to France and
 Great Britain.     Strickland, in 1848, further proved        to be generically
                                                                  it
 distinct from the Dodo.       The remains existing in Europe in 1852 were
 eighteen bones, of which <U+FB01>ve were at Paris, six at Glasgow, <U+FB01>ve in pos
 session of the Zoological Society (since transferred to the British Museum),
 and two in that of Strickland, who, at the date last mentioned, described
 them as belonging to two species, the second of which he named Pew
pkaps minor, from the great di<U+FB01>‘erence observable in the size of the
 specimens.     In 1864 one of the authors visited Rodriguez, and there found
in  a  cave two  more bones, while third was picked up by
                                      a                          gentleman with

him.      All these bones have been described, and most of them <U+FB01>gured, in
the publications of the Zoological Society, and in the large work of Strick—
land and Dr. Melville 4“.
   Encouraged     by his former success, that one of the authors of the present
paper who had before been to Rodriguez urged Mr. George Jenner, the
magistrate of the island, to make     more thorough search in its caves and in
                                      a                                      ;
1865 this gentleman sent no less than eighty-one specimens to Mauritius.
These were forthwith transmitted to London, and exhibited at  meeting ofa
the Zoological Society in that year, when   appeared that the notion pre
                                                 it
viously entertained of there having been two species of Pezoplzaps was
erroneous, and that probably the difference in size of the specimens was
sexual.
   News of this last discovery reached England during the meeting of the
British Association at Birmingham, and, prompted by Mr. P. L. Selater,
that body made       liberal grant to aid further researches.
                       a                                       Owing to
several causes, the scarcity of labourers in Rodriguez being the chief, nearly
a  year elapsed before these could be begun.              But in 1866, some
coolies having  been  expressly  sent thither to dig in the caves, very large
                                                                        a
collection of the bones of this bird, amounting       to nearly two thousand spe
cimens, was obtained.        These   specimens include   almost all the most im
portant parts of the skeleton, and furnish the authors with the material for
the present paper.

 1868.]                      Osteology  of   the Solitaire.                             429
    This vast series of specimens shows that there was             a very great     amount
 of individual variability in the bird, so much so as               to render the task of
 describing   them minutely, and yet generally, a very dif<U+FB01>cult one.                Yet, in
 consequence of this wealth of material, the authors have greater con<U+FB01>dence
 in the opinions they declare. Professor Owen, having lately published a
 very detailed account of the osteology of the Dodo *, the present paper
 follows as closely as possible the mode of treatment he therein adopted, the
 authors thinking that they are so consulting the convenience or those who
 may wish to compare the structure of the two allied birds.                      Thanks to
 him, also, they have been able themselves to examine the very specimens
 which he described; and they are further indebted to many others—Mr.
  George Clark of Mauritius, Professors Reinhardt, Fritsch, and Alphonse
 Milne-Edwards, Sir William Jardine, and Mr. Flower, for valuable assist
 ance in the shape of models or other additional material.                 To Mr. J. W.
 Clark they also mention their obligations for reconstructing from speci
 mens in their possession the skeletons of the Dodo and of two Solitaires
 now exhibited.
    The description of the latter follows in much detail, the amount of in
 dividual variability to which each bone was subject being specially dwelt
 on, and the whole compared bone by bone with that of the Dodo and also
 of Dizlunculus.      Pomp/zaps differs from Didunculus quite as much as Didus
 does, but it is nearly allied to the latter.             Still there are important dif
 ferences.    The neck was much longer than in Didus, and the vertebrae, on
 the whole, larger.      The ribs also possess perhaps somewhat thicker heads
 and articular tubercles.     The pelvis is much more rounded, and approaches
 that of the normal Pigeons much more than that of Didus does; but in its
 posterior portion it differs very remarkably from that of any known bird ;
 for the pubis in Didus has not yet been discovered.                     In the sternum
Pezophaps generally agrees with Didus, but has some distinctive features.
This bone shows articular surfaces for four sternal ribs only, instead of <U+FB01>ve,
 which seems to be the normal number in Didus ; and the posterior extre
 mity, so far as can be judged from the imperfect condition of the specimens,
is very unlike what it is in that bird; but the characters deducible from this
                                                                                 “
 lastportionin birds generally are shown to be very inconstant. The scapular

bling in this respect those of the generality ofbirds.            The angle made by the
junction   of  the coracoid  and  scapula   cannot       be  accurately determined, but
would appear to have been not much less than what it is in Didus. The
scapula is of very peculiar form, unlike, so far as known to the authors,
that of any bird, being inclined somewhat forward, and only pointing back
ward at its extremity, where it becomes spatulate in shape.                  The coracoid

racters.    It is much stouter than it is in Didus—a fact not so surprising
when the exceedingly abnormal form it there assumes is taken into consi
 deration.    At its  sternal end it differs from that of most other birds, in the
extension and rounding off of the outer border.            Other peculiarities in it
are also described, one of which appears to be sexual. This is the surface to
which the scapulais articulated, and which in the large individuals (presumed
to be males) is roughly quadrate, while in the smaller ones (the supposed
females) it is triangular.        In Pezophaps the bones of the wing are more
massive and smoother than in Didus, judging from such remains of the
latter as exist.     The most remarkable thing about them, however, is the
presence of abony knob on the radial side of the metacarpal, unlike what is
found in any other bird.         It is large in some of the specimens, supposed
to have belonged to old males, but very little developed in the presumed
females.     It is more or less spherical, pedunculate, and consists of a callus
like mass   with   a roughened surface, exceedingly like that of diseased bone,
 and   was probably covered by a horny integument.               It is situated im
 mediately beyond the proximal end and the index, which last would ap
 pear to be thrust away by it to some extent.           It answers most accurately
 and most unexpectedly to Leguat’s description of it =——“ L‘os de l’aileron
 grossit a l’extrémite', et forme sous la plume uue petite masse ronde
 comme une balle de mousquet.”            A description of its structure, as ascer
tained microscopically by Mr. J. Gedge, is added.            The extremity of the
wing is wanting.        The leg-bones of Pezophaps, when compared with those
of Didus, show more strongly developed ridges and muscular impressions,
just the converse of what is observable in those of the wing; but the leg
bones having been minutely and correctly described by prior authors, it is
unnecessary here to say much of them.             Part of the skull, too, had been
already described; but the only specimen then known was so incrusted
with stalagmite that not much could be made of it.            The present remains
show that it was very markedly di<U+FB01>'erent in many respects from that of
Dz'Jus.    The cranium is narrower and longer, and without the peculiar
frontal protuberance of Dirlus, being nearly <U+FB02>at at the top, with the fore
 and bind part elevated into two bony ridges of cancellous structure.           The
 upper mandible also presents a remarkable difference from that of Didue,
 where the axes of the nasal process and the maxillary converge, whereas
in Pezopliaps they diverge.         The maxilla also was relatively very small ;
and the mandible         differed by being much straighter above, showing a
 salient angle on its lower edge (which is very inconsiderable in Didus), and
being much more solid posteriorly.             In the quadrate the two birds are
more alike.     The rest of the bones of the head are wanting.
    A  comparison of the entire skeleton shows that Pezopkaps is in some
degree,   and perhaps on the whole, intermediate between Didua and the
normal Columbze, while it has some features, such as the armature of the
wing, quite peculiar. It has no very near a<U+FB02>inity to Didunculus ; indeed that
 form must be considered the type of a separate family, though not so aber

rant   as the Didirlee, which must be looked upon as the most remotely con
nected of the order Columbee.            Strickland was amply justi<U+FB01>ed in arriving
at  the  conclusion   that   the  Solitaire of Rodriguez was generically distinct
from the Dodo ; but it seems expedient to de<U+FB01>ne his genus Pezop/mps more
precisely.     Accordingly the following characters are assigned to it :—
    Rostrum mediocre, curvatum, processu nasali et ramis maxillaribus antice
divergentibus.      Frons plaua, porca osseo-cancellatii circumdata.             Ossa
coracoidea    robusta.     Alaa breves, involatiles.      Manus singulis bullis osseo
callosis armatae.      Collum ct pedcs longiores.
    In like manner the genus Didus may be de<U+FB01>ned :—
    Rostrum magnum, aduncum, processu nasali et ramis maxillaribusa nticc
convergentibus.       Frons tumida, in umbonem hypoconicum osseo-cancel
latum surgens.       Ossa coracoidea attenuata, scapulas obtuse attingentia.
Alze breves, involatiles.       Manus inermes. Collum et pedcs breviores.
    The account given by Leguat of his Solitaire is then quoted in full, as
also that of d’Heguerty, the latter from Strickland, and the authors pro
ceed to remark upon the different causes of extinction of species within
historic time. This, when effected by man’s agency, is seldom done by
man’s    will; and various cases are cited to support this opinion.          In extir
pating species man generally acts indirectly; and they succumb to forces
set in motion indeed by him, but without a thought on his part of their effect.
In the case of the extinction of the Solitaire of Rodriguez, the cause usually
suggested seems inadequate; and the authors consider it was probably
effected by feral Swine, and quote a remarkable passage from an old French
Voyage, showing the extraordinary abundance of these creatures in Mauri
 tius, where, in or about the year 1708, above <U+FB01>fteen hundred had been
 slain in one day.      It is plain that where these abounded inactive birds
 could not long survive.        It is supposed that the case was the same in
 Rodriguez as in Mauritius ; for in every country newly discovered by Euro
 peans, it has been an almost universal custom to liberate Pigs, and there is
 no reason to believe that the island <U+FB01>rst named was an exception thereto.
    The extraordinary <U+FB01>delity of Leguat’s account of the Solitaire is next con
 sidered. It is borne out in every point save one, perhaps, by a study of the
 remains.     The rugose surface at the base of the maxilla, the convexity of
 the pelvis, the somewhat lighter weight of the Solitaire than of the Dodo, its
 capacity for running, and, above all, the extraordinary knob on the wing, all
 agree with the description he has given us.             The authors attempt also to
 account for the origin of this last by observing that its appearance is so
 exactly that of diseased bone, that it may have been <U+FB01>rst of all occasioned
 by injuries received by the birds in such combats with one another as Leguat
 mentions, and aggravated by the continuance of their pugnacity;                   The
 authors remark, also, that it is the habit of Pigeons to <U+FB01>ght by bu<U+FB01>'cting
 with their pinions.                                   ~
     The particular in which chnnt may have erred is in the assertion, or
 perhaps rather inference, as to the monogamous habits of the Solitaire ; and

 432                   Messrs. A. and E. Newton on the                  [June 11,
 the cause of the error     (if such it be) may be ascribed, without derogating
 from his truthfulness,    to his anxiety to point a moral, which may have led
 him to imagine he saw what he wished to see. He especially mentions that
 one sex would not <U+FB01>ght with the other, which is just what takes place among
 polygamous birds.       The case of a very well-known bird (Otis tar-11a),
 about which much has been written, is then cited, to show that even now,
 after centuries of observation, it is doubtful whether it be monogamous or
polygamons.       Leguat, therefore, may easily have been mistaken in his
 opinion, even setting aside his evident leaning on the matter.        The notion
of Pezopkaps having      been polygamous was before entertained by one of the
authors, and arises from a consideration of the great difference in the size
of the two sexes, which in birds is generally accompanied by polygamous
habits  ; but the question is now not likely to be solved.
    The amount of variability which every bone of the skeleton of this species
presents, warrants the conclusion that as much was displayed in those
parts of its structure which have perished, letting alone Leguat’s direct
evidence as to the individual difference in the plumage of the females.          If
such a process, therefore, as has been termed
                                                         “ Natural Selection,” or
 “Survival of the Fittest,” exists, there would have been abundant room
for it to operate; and there having been only one species of Pezophaps
might, at <U+FB01>rst sight, seem an argument against the belief in such a process.
A little re<U+FB02>ection, however, will show that such an argument is unsound.
Con<U+FB01>ned in a space so restricted as one small island, every individual of
the species must have been subject to conditions essentially identical in all
cases.    Whatever power such a process might possess, there would be
neither occasion nor opportunity for its operation, so long as no change took
place in the physical character of the island.        But if we venture to indulge
our fancy, and consider what would have been the inevitable result of a
gradual upheaval of the island, and a corresponding extension of its area
until it became vastly increased and its original low rounded hills were
exalted into mountains, it is plain that a great variety of physical con
ditions would   be thereby incurred.        One side of the island would be ex
posed to  the full force and   direct in<U+FB02>uence  of the trade-winds, the other side
would be completely sheltered from them.            The climate of these two por
tions would    accordingly    differ, and a great difference would be speedily
wrought in the character of their vegetation, while that of the elevated
central part would undergo a corresponding modi<U+FB01>cation. After some longer
or shorter period, we can conceive the island itself being broken up into two
portions, separated from one another by a strait, such as divides the North
and Middle Islands of New Zealand.            This rupture would certainly tend
still more to a<U+FB02>'eet the existing fauna and <U+FB02>ora; and at the end of another
epoch there can be little doubt but the animals and plants of each portion,
exposed to different in<U+FB02>uences, would present a decidedly different appear
ance, and the eastern and western islands (supposing             the separation to
have taken place in the direction of the meridian) might each possess its

 own special form    of Solitaire, as the islands composing New Zealand have
 their peculiar species of Apteryx.
    But it is only in such a case as has just been imagined that considerable
 modi<U+FB01>cations would be likely to be effected.            It therefore seems to be no
 argument against the existence of such a process as that of “ Natural Selec
 tion,” to <U+FB01>nd a small oceanic island tenanted by a single species which was
 subject to great individual variability. Indeed a believer in this theory would
 be inclined to predicate that it would be just under such circumstances
 that the greatest amount of variability would be certain to occur.               In its
 original state, attacked by  no  enemies,  the   increase  of  the species would   only
 be dependent on the supply of food, which, one year with another, would
 not vary much, and the form would continue without any predisposing cause
to change, and thus no advantage would be taken of the variability of struc
ture presented by its individuals.
    On the other hand, we may re<U+FB02>ect on what certainly has taken place.              Of
the other terrestrial members of the avifauna of Rodriguez but few now
remain.     A small Finch and a Warbler, both endemic (the <U+FB01>rst belonging
to a group almost entirely con<U+FB01>ned to Madagascar and its satellites, the
second to a genus extending from Africa to Australia), are the only two
land-birds of its original fauna now known to exist.             The Guinea-fowl and
Love-bird have in all probability      been introduced        from Madagascar; but
the Parrots and Pigeons of which        Leguat speaks have vanished.           The re
mains of one of the <U+FB01>rst, and the       description of the last, leave little room
to doubt but they also were closely     allied to the forms found in Madagascar
and the other li'Iascarene islands ; and thus it is certainly clear that four
out of the sire indigenous species had their natural allies in other spe
cies belonging to the same zoological province.              It seems impossible on
any other reasonable supposition than that of               a    common ancestry to
account for this fact.     The authors are compelled to the belief that there
was once a time when Rodriguez, Mauritius, Bourbon, Madagascar, and
probably the Seychelles were connected by dry land, and that that time is
suf<U+FB01>ciently  remote to have permitted the descendants of the original inha
bitants of this now submerged continent to become modi<U+FB01>ed into the many
different representative forms which are now known.               Whether this result
                                                “                      ”
can have been effected by the process of Natural Selection                must remain
an open question;     but  that   the Solitaire    of  Rodriguez,    and  the Dodo of
Mauritius, much as they eventually came to di<U+FB02>'er, sprang from one and
the same parent stock, seems a deduction so obvious, that the authors can
no more conceive any one fully acquainted with the facts of the case
hesitating about its adoption than that he can doubt the existence of the
Power by whom these       species  were thus formed.

                                               (Abstract.)
   The authorities of the colony of Victoria formed (in 1862) the wish to
establish, in connexion with their new observatory at Melbourne, a power
ful telescope for observing the Southern Nebulae, and applied, through
the Duke of Newcastle, to the President and Council of the Royal Society
for encouragement and advice.      That body had in former years given
much        attention         to this subject, and had received a report              from a Com
mittee on    in the hope of inducing the British Government to take such
                    it,
a step.  The same Committee was consulted, and made another report
almost identical with the <U+FB01>rst.     In consequence of     the Legislature of
                                                                           it,
Victoria ordered   the construction   of the telescope in 1865, which was
undertaken early in the following year       Mr. Grubb, under the direction
                                                            by
of a Committee consisting of the late Earl of Rosse, Dr. Robinson, and
Mr. W. De La Rue. After Lord Rosse’s death, his son, the present Earl,
was appointed in his stead by the President. It has been very success
fully completed; and           thought that some account of
                                     it   is                         and the           it,
 notable thingsthat occurred in its progress, may deserve      record.  As        a
 an introduction to this account,   notice of the reasons which guided the
                                                 a
 Committee in some of their decisions may be useful.
      1.They chose         four-feet Re<U+FB02>ector,
                                a                  because,   from the experience
 gained   with  Lord  Rosse’s   and  Mr. Lassell’s   telescope, they were satis<U+FB01>ed
 that this aperture was suf<U+FB01>cient forthe work proposed, and also because                           it
 had not been proved that         larger one could be cquatorially mounted with
                                          a
 the requisite <U+FB01>rmness and ease of motion.            This last, however, has been
 convincingly disposed of by the present experiment.
    2. They chose the Re<U+FB02>ector in preference to the Achromatic, because
it     not probable that one of the latter will ever he made which shall
      is
 equal     four-feet in light, and because,
            a                                        were, the cost of
                                                            if   it        would be    it
 tremendous.       One of the Committee got from          great continental optician
                                                                       a
 an estimate for one of 30 inches, which would have amounted, complete,
 to £20,000, and been far inferior in power.           Absurd exaggeration        not        is
 uncommon in comparing these two kinds of telescopes, but             easily refuted.
                                                                                 is
A    speculum re<U+FB02>ects, after years of use, 064 of the incident light, which                        is
 the intensity of IIerschel’s front view.        In the Newtonian the coef<U+FB01>cient
 is 0401      in the Aehromatic light
                ;                         lost from two causes :-<U+FB01>rst, by re<U+FB02>ec
                                                  is

  Fresnel's formula, and gives the coef<U+FB01>cient of intensity 0'81, whence the
 equivalent to  four-feet Newtonian

 it must be greater than this; for no glass     perfectly transparent, and
                                                                      is
 therefore absorbs light according to  law depending on its thickness and
                                                       a
 a    certain constant.             Dr. Robinson discusses this, and comes to the con

   1868.]                  great PvIulbourne Telescope.                      4-35
   clnsion that the equivalent Achromatic will certainly not be less than
   3 feet, and may be much more.      He adduces experimental facts in support
   of this, and points out the conditions which are necessary for a fair com
   parison of the two kinds.
      3. The tube was to be metal lattice-work.       This plan, originally pro
   posed by Sir J. Herschel, had been tried by Lord Rosse, Mr. Lassell, and
   Mr. W. De la Rue, with marked advantage; its main purpose is to dimi
   nish the evils caused by currents of unequally heated air eddying in the
   tube.
      4. They decided that the speculum should be metal, and not silvered
  glass.    It seemed imprudent to risk the success of the undertaking by
  venturing on an experiment whose success was not assured; it was not
  known whether the silver could be uniformly deposited on so large a
  scale; some facts appear to show that glass is more liable to irregular
  action than speculum metal; and the intensity of the light in these tele
  scopes is not as great as had been expected.
      5. The telescope was to be a Cassegraiu, not a Newtonian; and this
  was the result of long discussion.   This form is little known, for Newton’s
  hostility to it has created a prejudice against it. Its chief defect is the
  dif<U+FB01>culty of getting a magnifying power so low that the eye can only take
  in the whole pencil, as the <U+FB01>rst image is magni<U+FB01>ed from <U+FB01>ve to six times
  by the second speculum.      This requires a huge eyepiece, of which the
 lenses are costly, and, by their thickness, intercept light.       One defect
 attributed to it by Newton proves to be an advantage; he thought that
 the re<U+FB02>ection of metal is like that of glass, faintest at perpendicular inci
 dence, but increasing in intensity with the obliquity; therefore brighter in
 his telescope at 45° than in the other nearly perpendicular.     But it is now
 known that the law is different, so that the re<U+FB02>ection at 45° is glu' less
 powerful than the other.      The chief advantage of the Cassegrain, and
 that which in<U+FB02>uenced the Committee, is its extreme convenience to the ob—
 server; he is near the ground, and has to move through a small space to
 command the whole sky, instead of standing on a structure nearly 40 feet
 high, which cannot be used without fatigue and even danger.
     Then formulae are given for <U+FB01>nding the constants of the telescope; the
 foci of its specula are 366 and 75 inches, its lowest power 240, and its
 extreme <U+FB01>eld of view 14"3.
     The composition of the specula is Lord Rosse’s, four equivalents of
copper and one of tin, respecting which much detail is given; and still
more of the process of casting the <U+FB01>rst speculum, which took place July
3, 1866.      This was managed according to the method of Lord Rossc,
with some modi<U+FB01>cation, caused by the necessity of having a projecting
band round the edge of the speculum, and an aperture in its centre. It was
conducted without accident, and safely transferred to the annealing-oven, in
which a thermocouple of platinum and iron was inserted, which, at the
end of twenty-four days, showed that it was completely cooled.         It came

out perfectly sound, but was a little “in winding,” and had Lord Rosse’s
“ Crowsfeet ” on part of its surface. These might have been ground out,
but Mr. Grubb preferred recasting it. It was broken by an iron ram of
70 lbs. falling four feet. When the blows were applied through a bar of
wood, they did nothing; but the <U+FB01>rst one through iron broke it into four
equal pieces.    These, when put together, <U+FB01>tted exactly, showing that
there was no unequal shrinkage in cooling.        Some changes were made
before the second casting, on Sept. 22.    The hoop-bed of the mould was
much strengthened ; the core, which formed the central aperture, and
seemed to interfere with the regular <U+FB02>ow of the metal, was raised 1% inch
above the mould; and this last set on a strong cast-iron frame, which
could be inclined at pleasure.    It was sloped, so that at the <U+FB01>rst part of
the pouring the melted alloy <U+FB01>lled it from its lower edge to its middle; it
was then lowered   rapidly to be horizontal while the pouring was com
pleted.   When it came from the oven, the central disk, which was under
the core, was cut out.  This, as well as the third casting, which was made
November     24, came out perfect.
  A   description is given of the polishing machine, which is remarkable
for its smooth and equable action, and not less so for the facility it gives
of testing the <U+FB01>gure of the speculum during the polishing. Removing the
polisher (which is built up of wood, so as to combine great strength and
lightness), one man, by turningawinch, sets the speculum upright. Doors
are opened, and by an eyepiece properly placed a dial or arti<U+FB01>cial star at a
suitable distance is examined.  The specula were ground <U+FB02>at at their back,
and true at their edges; and their focal lengths differ only 1; inch.
   Not less important than the perfect <U+FB01>gure of a speculum is its being so
supported both at the back and edge that it may be subjected to no irre
gular pressure, for to such it is almost inconceivably sensitive.   The ar
rangements to secure this are very elegant, and have proved entirely suc
cessful.
   The lattice of the tube consists of steel bars ;} thick, and, on average,
 2% broad, forming openings of l7 by 9 ; it is very light, and so stiff that
 l cwt. produced only a de<U+FB02>ection <U+FB01>lm inch at 20 feet. The mode of sup
porting the small specula is described, and the mechanism by which the
moving of them for focal adjustment is made easy to the observer.       One
of these speeula is peculiar; it is an achromatized lens, whose coincident
surfaces are cemented; its front one so curved that there can be no false
image formed by    it,
                     its fourth coated pretty thickly with silver. This will
be more permanent than the metal, and   expected to give more light.

    If, nevertheless, several modern authors have not hesitated to represent
the composition of persulphide          of hydrogen by the formula
                                           H2 82’       _
with or without     a sign   of interrogation, their statements   are no longer based
upon the secure      foundation     of experience.
    Of late peculiar circumstances have again directed the attention of
chemists to this remarkable compound.                 Among the technico-chemical
aspirations which the Paris Exhibition has brought to light, none have
been received with more satisfaction than the efforts, manifested in avariety
of forms, of resuscitating for the purposes of industry the quantities of
sulphur buried in the mountains            of soda-waste, which accumulate in the
neighbourhood of our factories.            Chemists have more especially admired
the processes by which M. Schatfner on the one hand, and Messrs P. W.
Hofmann and P. Buquet on the other, have endeavoured to solve this
problem.      In certain phases of the reactions utilized for this purpose,
enormous quantities of persulphide of hydrogen are frequently produced;
and only lately, when visiting the chemical works at Dieuze, where the sul
phur is regenerated on a colossal scale, the author of this Note has had an
opportunity of experimenting with many kilogrammes of this interesting
sulphur-compound.
    Under these circumstances the author has examined with great interest a.
compound which he discovered by accident, and the analysis of which
appears to throw some light on the composition of the persulphide.
    On adding a cold saturated solution of strychniue in strong alcohol to
an alcoholic solution of polysulphide            of ammonium, brilliant crystalline
spangles    soon  begin    to appear    in the   liquid, and after twelve hours, the
walls of  the  vessel  are  covered   with  beautiful  orange-red needles, frequently
attaining the length of a centimetre, which, after the removal of the
mother-liquor, have to be washed only once or twice with cold alcohol, in
order to render them perfectly pure. The crystals are insoluble in water,
 alcohol, and ether, also in bisulphide of carbon; indeed I have not yet
 found a solvent from which they could have been recrystallized.
    Analysis has led to the formula
                       021  H2: N2 02 Sa=Czi H22 N2 02! H: 83'
 Hence the crystals      are a compound      of 1 mol. of strychninc   with 1 mol. of
 a persulphide    of hydrogen, of the composition
                                            H2 8,.
 Indeed the strychnine-compound             splits up in the sense of the above con
 ception.    In contact with concentrated sulphuric acid the orange~red
 crystals are decolorizcd, and on addition of a small quantity of water, co
lourless, transparent, oily droplets of persulphide of hydrogen are separated,
 sulphate of strychuine remaining in solution.             The oily drops remain un
 altered for some time, but are ultimately decomposed into sulphur and
  sulphuretted   hydrogen.

   The investigation of this sharply de<U+FB01>ned strychnine-eompound, which
can be preserved for months without undergoing any decomposition, goes
far to prove the existence of a persulphide of hydrogen,

it    is,
      however, by no means improbable that compounds of hydrogen and
sulphur in several proportions may exist.
   The formation of the strychnine-compound   which   have described,            I
and which have often prepared with the same result, could not fail to
                I
lead to an examination of several other alkaloids in similar direction.          a
 Quinine, cinchonine, brucine, and several other vegetal bases were re
peatedly submitted to the action of an alcoholic solution of polysulphide
of ammonium, but in no case were similar phenomena observed.
    The compound of strychninc with persulphide of hydrogen          remarkable       is
 for its insolubility. An alcoholic solution containing 2'03 grs. of strychnine,
when mixed with an alcoholic solution of polysulphide of ammonium and
allowed to stand for twelve hours, was found to have deposited 2'287 grs.
of the red crystals,       e. 872 per cent. of the theoretical
                                1'.                                amount.                      It
 deserves to be examined, whether the property possessed by strychnine, of
 forming so insoluble     compound with persulphide of hydrogen, could not
                                a
 be utilized for the purpose of preparing this alkaloid, and in certain cases
 even for its detection and separation from other substances with which                         it
might        be mixed.

chemical equivalent, or      P
     The largest generalization arrived at is that the refraction-equivalent           of
a compound       is the sum of the refraction-equivalents         of its constituents.
This has been sufficiently proved in a multitude of instances among the
compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and it has been shown, or
assumed to be the case, in the combinations of many other elementary
bodies*.
     My   more recent researches have branched off into several lines, but an
 especial attempt has been made to answer the following questions.                  Have
 any of the elements more than one de<U+FB01>nite refraction-equivalent?                     and
 what are the refraction-equivalents          of the metallic elements?          A large
 mass of observations bearing on these points has been gathered together,
 and more or less collated, but it is yet imperfect, and my present object is
 rather to indicate     the principal method of inquiry than to publish the
 actual results.
     As the metals are opaque, their refractive indices cannot be determined
 in a direct manner as those of gaseous hydrogen, liquid phosphorus, crys
 tallized carbon, and other transparent elements have been.                An attempt
 must therefore be made to determine their effect on the rays of light by
 examining their compounds ; but their crystalline salts are very frequently
  doubly refracting, owing to some peculiarities of internal structure, and,
  where they give only one spectrum, there are practical dif<U+FB01>culties about
  the experiment that are not encountered in dealing with liquid bodies.
  The solutions of these salts have only one refraction, and it occurred to me
  that they might afford an easy means of determining the refraction-equiva
  lents, <U+FB01>rst, of the compounds themselves, and secondly, of their metallic
  and other constituents.        In practice, many sources of error presented
  themselves, all of which tell upon the ultimate result, and which necessi
  tated improved apparatus, and great care both in preparing the solutions
  and in taking the observations.
      The method generally adopted was as follows :—An amount of salt re
  presenting the chemical equivalent was dissolved in n equivalents of water,

and the refractive index and density of the solution were taken.        From
these was reckoned the refraction-equivalent,  and subtracting from this n
times the refraction-equivalent of water for the solar line A, there remained
the refraction-equivalent of the dissolved salt for that part of the spec~
trum.    That this fairly represents the action exerted on light by the
chemical compound itself is supported by several considerations.         1st. In
the few cases, such as chloride of sodium and sugar, where the refraction
equivalent of the substance has been obtained, both in the solid and
dissolved condition, it is found to be the same.      2nd. Solutions of several
organic  substances, such   as formic  and   citric acids, give the theoretically
correct equivalent for these substances.     3rd. The refraction-equivalent     of
a salt seems to be the same, whether it be dissolved in water or in alcohol.
4th. The refraction-equivalent      of a salt in solution is not affected by
altering  the amount  of  water  in which it is dissolved.    5th. The numbers
reckoned for these salts in solution bear such a remarkable relation to one
another as to force the conviction that they are made up of two compo
nents, the one depending on the metal, the other on the substance com
bined with it. To exhibit the nature and force of this argument, it would
be necessary to tabulate a long series of results; but for the present                                                           I

it   is evident that the refraction-equivalents of the compounds of potassium
differ    very widely according to the nature of the electro-negative     con
stituents; again,              that
                         the refraction-equivalents   of the compounds of
sodium    differ    pari
                    paasu with those of the potassium compounds, being
always less by a number varying from 3'0 to 3'9.        From this it may be
fairly concluded that the electro-negative constituent has the same effect on
light, whichever metal it is united with, and that the refraction-equivalent
of potassium exceeds that of sodium by 3'4, or thereabouts.     But does the
Table afford the data for determining the absolute equivalent of one or
other of these metals '2 It was at <U+FB01>rst thought that this would he arrived
at by a comparison of the metal with hydrogen, the refraction-equivalent of
which has hitherto been estimated at 1'3(or ['5 in the case of water) ; but
the last column shows that the difference between potassium and hydrogen
is not always the same, the differences being greater than can be attributed
to errors of observation.    Indeed the numbers seem to fall into two
groups: with the mineral acids the differences lie between 4'0 and 4'7,
while with water, alcohol, and the organic acids, they are always upwards
of 6, varying indeed from 6'2 to 6'8, the average being 6'55. But it is in
these last-mentioned compounds that the equivalent of hydrogen is believed
to be 1'3.      Assuming this, we may reckon the refraction-equivalent             of
potassium     to  be   about    6135+  l '3, that      7'85.    We is,have, however,
other means of arriving at an estimation.              Chlorine, in such bodies as

reckoned as 16'0+9'2, that is, 25'2.            Subtracting    these numbers from
those of the respective potassium salts, we obtain the equivalent of the
metal.    Thus from different sources we may calculate for the value of
potassium      :—

     These numbers are tolerably close, though the equivalent of potassium,
deduced from    its inorganic, would, on the whole, be higher than that

and since a sodium salt has a refraction-equivalent                 generally    3'4   lower
than the corresponding potassium salt, we may reckon
                    Sodium......      ....                    ..=4'6".
    If  instead   of taking     the  refraction-equivalent     P    %l,    we reckon      the

                    Sodium                                          0'200
This    implies    that  equal quantities of these two analogous metals exert
very nearly,    if  not precisely, the same effect on the velocity of the rays of
light.
    Another deduction from the above Table is that already alluded to in
 regard to hydrogen ; while in the organic acids it probably has the known
refraction-equivalent       1'3, it would seem that in the others, viz. hydro
chloric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, nitric, metaphosphoric,                   and sulphuric
acids, it has a very much higher refraction-equivalent,              one in fact which is
little less than sodium, and falls short of potassium by only about 4'3.
 Hence we may we deduce—
                    Hydrogen in organic compounds           . . . . =l'3
                    Hydrogen in mineral acids. .. . .      ... ..=3'7
How far this conclusion           may hold good throughout,            and whether one
number should        be an exact multiple of the other number, must remain to
be determined       by future observations.       It appears, however, to answer in
the af<U+FB01>rmative       the question whether an element can have more than one
de<U+FB01>nite refraction-equivalent.
    Of course, from the Table given above, it would be easy to deduce
values for each of the electro-negative constituents; but it would be safer
to generalize from a larger number of instances.
    The series of observations on potasisum and sodium salts are the most
complete and the most carefully revised of any which have yet been made ;
but   if their refraction-equivalents are <U+FB01>xed, it becomes a much simpler
matter to determine those of most other metals.               Thus, of lead the nitrate
and acetate have alone been examined;             but as the refraction-equivalents
reckoned for these salts differ from those of the corresponding potassium
compounds in each instance by 4'1, the presumption is great that the
refraction-equivalent      of lead is very near 8'0+4'l, or 121.
    The following are numbers deduced from two or more salts of each
metal.     They must be looked upon only as approximately true, and any
subsequent modi<U+FB01>cation of the value 8'0 for potassium, must lead to a
corresponding      modi<U+FB01>cation     of the whole series.

    The present Memoir is supplementary to my “ Second Memoir on Skew
 Surfaces, otherwise Scrolls,” Phil. Trans. vol. cliv. (1864) pp. 559—577,
and relates also to the theory of skew surfaces of the fourth order, or quartic
 scrolls.    It was pointed out to me by Herr Schwarz, in a letter dated Halle,
 June 1, 1867, that in the enumeration contained in my Second Memoir
 I have given only a particular case of the quartic scrolls, which have a
 directrix skew cubic; viz. my eighth species, S (1, 3"), where there is also
 a directrix line.      And this led me to observe that I had in like manner
mentioned only a particular case of the quartic scrolls with a triple direc
trix line; viz. my third species, S (13, 1, 4), where there is also a simple
directrix line. The omitted species, say, ninth species, S (13), with a triple
directriz line, and tenth species, S (32), with a directrix skew cubic, are
considered in the present Memoir; and in reference to them I develope a
theory of the reciprocal relations of these scrolls, which has some very
interesting analytical features.                           _

V.      “ Transformation of the Aromatic Monamines                      into Acids
         richer    in  Carbon.—III. On Menaphtylamine.”             By A. W. Hor
         MANN, LL.D., F.R.S.             Received June 1, 1868.
     The transformation of naphtaline into its carboxylic acid suggests the
existence of a large number of compounds which the progress of science
cannot fail to realize.           It is not my intention to examine in detail this
group of substances, the composition and even the properties of which are
suf<U+FB01>ciently indicated by theory.            There are nevertheless several terms of
this series      which   I  must   not  leave unprepared whilst engaged with this
 question.        These are the aldehyde, the alcohol, and the monamine of the
 series.      It is the latter substance of which I beg permission to submit to
 day a short account to the Royal Society.
     My <U+FB01>rst attempts to produce the aromatic monamine were anything but
 successful.        Cyanide of uaphtyl, when left in contact with zinc and sul
 phuric acid, even for weeks, was found to yield but tri<U+FB02>ing quantities
 of menaphtylamine.           The greater portion of the nitrile was left unchanged,
 while more or less, by the absorption of the elements of water, was con
 verted into menaphtoxylamide              and even into menaphtoxylic      acid.   A
 slight modi<U+FB01>cation, however, of the process usually adopted has removed
 these dif<U+FB01>culties.
      It  is well known that     M. Mendius,    after he had discovered the remark
 able property possessed by nitriles of <U+FB01>xing two molecules of hydrogen, has
 submitted also the amides to the action of hydrogen in conditions naecendi,
 in   the hopes of replacing their oxygen by hydrogen, and of producing also
 in this manner the primary monamiues. These experiments have not been
 successful.        In the presence of the dif<U+FB01>culties attending the preparation of
 menaphtylamine,           the idea suggested itself of trying whether the sul—
 phuretted amide of the series into which the nitrile is so easily transformed
 would not be more readily attacked by nascent hydrogen than the nitrile
 itself.     The result of this experiment was highly satisfactory.       On submit
  ting    an  alcoholic   solution  of  menaphtothiamide   to  the action of zinc and
 hydrochloric acid, torrents of sulphuretted hydrogen are at once evolved.
  The addition of zinc and hydrochloric acid, and sometimes also of a little
 alcohol, is continued, until, after a day or two, the disengagement of sul
 phuretted hydrogen almost ceases.            The liquid is now mixed with concen
 trated soda until the precipitate of hydrate of zinc, which is formed in the
 commencement, is redissolved.              An oily layer containing much soda and
  alcohol is seen to separate and to collect on the surface of the aqueous solu
  tion. This layer is removed and heated in the water-bath until the alcohol
  is volatilized. An aqueous liquid is thus produced, on which a yellow oil is
  <U+FB02>oating.       The latter is principally menaphtylamine, which is still mixed
  with a small quantity of cyanide of uaphtyl regenerated from the thio
  compound.           The oil is treated with dilute hydrochloric acid, the hydro

  chloric liquid separated by <U+FB01>ltration from the cyanide, and decomposed by
 hydrate of sodium, when the base separates in a state of purity.
     Menaphtylamine is a very caustic liquid, boiling between 290° and 293°.
  Freshly distilled it is colourless, but soon acquires a yellow tint. It at
 tracts carbonic acid with such avidity that it is impossible to pour it from
 one vessel into another without a pellicle of the di<U+FB02>icultly soluble carbonate
 being formed on its surface.
     The composition of the base was suf<U+FB01>ciently indicated by theory; it ap
 peared nevertheless desirable to establish it experimentally by the analyses
 of the hydrochlorate and the platinum-salt.
     The hydrochlorate crystallizes with the greatest facility in dil‘<U+FB01>cultly
 soluble needles, containing

     The yellow     crystalline precipitate which is formed by the addition         of
perchloride    of platinum to the hydrochlorate has the composition
               0,, n“ N, Pt       01, =  2  [(0, 11,) n, N, HCI], Pt 01,.
     The transformation        of the thio-ccmpound into menaphtylaminc is thus
 seen simply   to  consist    in the substitution of 2 atoms of hydrogen for 1 atom
 of sulphur :—
                       C,l H<U+FB02>    NS+2HH=Cll           H11  N+H2    S.
    I have but   little to   say about the properties     of menaphtylamine ; never
theless the extraordinary          crystalline tendencies of its salts deserve to be
mentioned.      The sulphate and nitrate are likewise dit<U+FB01>cultly soluble ; the
latter crystallizes in splendid nitrelike prisms.          In contact with bisulphide
of carbon menaphtylamine solidi<U+FB01>es at once to a crystalline mass. When
treated with alcoholic soda and chloroform, it is converted into the terribly
 smelling formomenaphtylnitrile, which I propose to examine somewhat
more in detail.
    I have also prepared       benzylamine, starting from thiobenzamide instead of
benzonitrile.     The experiment is of course likewise successful, the advan—
tage, however, less conspicuous, since benzonitrile            <U+FB01>xes hydrogen  with far
greater facility than the cyanide of naphtyl.
    Be this, however,     as it may, the facility with which hydrogen in condi—
tione naccemh'      acts   upon sulphur-compounds deserves to be noticed.            I
propose to examine      in  the direction indicated by the above experiments some
of the more important sulphur-compounds,               more especially the thin-acids
of the fatty and aromatic series, and the two groups of sulphocyanic ethers.
The investigation of the latter, indeed, has already furnished me results of
great neatness and precision.
    In conclusion,    I must not leave unmentioned           that, since my <U+FB01>rst com

is thus satisfactorily   established.

  The authors, after reviewing brie<U+FB02>y the two theories on the nature of
sun-spots, which are still subjects of dispute, refer to the stereoscopic views
obtained and the results published in their ‘ Researches on Solar Physics,’
and state the reasons which have led them to believe that sun-spots are
cavities and at a lower level than the sun’s photosphere. Their opinion
has been recently strengthened by observations of a sun-spot on the 7th of
May, which in disappearing produced in two successive photograms inden—
tations in the west limb.
   After proving by the measurements made, which, with the calculations,
are appended to their paper, that there can be no doubt about the identity
of the heliographical elements of the previously observed spot and the
successive indentations, they prove from the established details of the
phenomena of sun-spots that such indentations must under all circumstances
be very rare occurrences, and state fully the conditions favourable to the
recurrence of similar observations, inviting observers to give their particular
attention to them.

448                Mr. Callender    on the Bones   of  the Face.       [June 18,
fectly acquainted, such as the growth of the maxilla, and the formation
and subsequent obliteration of the intermaxillary bones.             As they are
simply a narration of facts, it is almost impossible        to give a satisfactory
abstract of them.
    After brief consideration of the arrangement of the cartilages for the
ethmoid and turbinate bones and for the septum of the nose, an account
is given of the appearances observed in a human fmtus four-tenths of an
inch long, noticing the relations of the maxillary lobes, of the parts which
represent the palate, and showing that the opposite sides unite from before
backwards to form the palate, the soft palate remaining ununited in a
foetus   one inch and <U+FB01>ve-tenths long.       The superior maxilla is described,
before ossi<U+FB01>cation has commenced, in a fmtus nine-tenths of an inch long.
Although ossi<U+FB01>cation begins in this bone at many distinct points, the ra
pidity with which the separate ossi<U+FB01>cations are fused make it undesirable
to name each as a distinct centre.       The palatal and alveolar portions are
formed somewhat later than the remainder of the bone.              In a foetus two
inches and three-tenths long the bone consists of a nasal process, deeply
grooved on its inner surface, of an incisor process, which has not hitherto
been accurately described, of orbital and of palatal-alveolar portions; the
infraorbital <U+FB01>ssure is distinctly marked, and a deep notch shows the situ
ation of the canine socket.
    The principal changes which are noticed during the growth of the bone
 result from the thickening and marking of the nasal process, the forma
 tion of the nasal groove and of the inner and outer walls of the antrum,
 the variations in the relative size of that cavity, the deepening of the sockets
 for the teeth, the formation of the septa dividing them, and the changes in
 the orbital plate.    The order and method of these changes are separately
 narrated.
     The ossi<U+FB01>cation of the vomer is shown to commence from its inferior
 and anterior parts, whence also ossi<U+FB01>cation extends to the intemaxillary
 bones, which are formed in the membrane bounding the anterior nares.
 Each of these bones acquires its greatest independent size in a fuatns about
 four inches and a half long, and then consists of a nasal process, which
 eventually fuses with the corresponding portion of the superior maxilla, its
 apex assisting to form the ridge for the turbinate bone, and of plates which
 strengthen the incisor portion, and form part of the walls of the incisor
 sockets.    In  a foetus  six inches and seven-tenths     long the apex alone is
  distinct, and in   a fuztus  nine inches long the bone is lost in the upper
  maxilla, although    the <U+FB01>ssure along its posterior margin still outlines its
  shape.    The bone grows in the <U+FB01>ssure between the incisor process and the
  palate, and is shut off from the face by the <U+FB01>rst-named and by the nasal
  process.    Distinctly outlined at the close of the fourth month, it is joined
  to the superior maxilla during the latter part of the <U+FB01>fth or beginning         of
 the sixth month.
      Some facts are related respecting the formation of several of the remaining

bones of the face, and that of the inferior maxilla   is specially referred to.
This  bone is beginning to ossify in a foetus nine-tenths of an inch long, and
is distinctly formed in a fmtus one inch and one-tenth long.         Each half
may be said to grow from four centres, formed (1) by the cartilage which
tips the condyloid extremity, (2) by the layer of membrane in front of
Meckel’s cartilage, (3) by the ossi<U+FB01>cation of the anterior extremity of
Meckel’s cartilage, (4) by deposits of bone in the pcrichondrium of the
anterior and middle thirds of the same cartilage, from which is derived the
plate of bone which forms the base of the dental canal.
   After giving the measurements of the angles formed between the ascend
ing ramus and the body of the bone, and after referring to the subdivisions
of the groove for the teeth, the growth of the mylo-hyoidean ridge is de
scribed, as well as the ossi<U+FB01>cation of the anterior extremity of Meckel’s
cartilage, the latter forming a triangular block beneath the incisor sockets,
to the twist acquired by which the prominence of the front of the maxilla,
known as the mentum or chin, appears to be due.     In a foetus four inches
and seven-tenths long, the block of bone formed in the anterior extremity
of the   cartilage of Meckel is still clearly de<U+FB01>ned.

  The experiments described in this paper were made in the laboratory of Mr.
Gassiot, who placed his great battery of 2600 cells of bichloride of mercury
at the disposal of the author. Mr.Willoughby Smith lent his resistance—coils
of 1,102,000 Ohms; Messrs. Forde and Fleeming Jenkin lent a sensitive
galvanometer,     a set   of   resistance-coils,  and a key for double
                                                      a bridge,
simultaneous contacts ; and Mr. C. Hockin undertook the observation of
the galvanometer, the adjustment of the resistances, and the testing of
the galvanometer, the resistance-coils, and the micrometer-screw.   The
electrical balance itself was made by Mr. Becker.
   The experiments consisted in observing the equilibrium of two forces,
one of which was the attraction   between two disks, kept at acertain differ
ence  of potential, and the other was the repulsion between two circular
coils, through which a certain current passed in opposite directions.      For
this purpose one of the  disks, with one of the coils  attached  to its hinder
surface, was suspended on one arm of a torsion-balance, while the other
disk, with the other coil behind         it,
                                     was placed at    certain distance, which
                                                               a
was measured by      amicrometer-screw.    The suspended disk, which was
smaller than the <U+FB01>xed disk, was adjusted so that in its position of equi
librium its surface was in the same plane with that of
                                                             “ guard-ring,” as
                                                                    a

   in Sir W. Thomson’s electrometers, and its position was observed by means
   of a microscope directed on a graduated glass scale attached to the disk.
   In this way its position could be adjusted to the thousandth of an inch,
   while a motion of much smaller extent was easily detected.
       An exactly similar coil was placed at the other end of the torsion
  balance, so as to get rid of the e<U+FB01>’ects of terrestrial magnetism.
       It was found that though the suspended disk and coil weighed about
  half a pound, a very slight want of equality between the opposing forces
  could be detected, and remedied by means of the micrometer.
      The difference of potential between the disks was maintained by means
  of Mr. Gassiot’s great battery.      To measure this difference of potential, it
  was made to produce a current through Mr. Willoughby Smith’s re
  sistance-coil, and the primary coil of the galvanometer shunted with a
  variable resistance.
      The current in the coils was maintained by a Grove’s battery, and was
 led through the secondary coil of the galvanometer.
      One observer, by means of the micrometer-screw,          altered the distance
  of the disks till the suspended disk was in equilibrium at zero. At the
  same    time the other     observer altered the shunt,   till the galvanometer
 needle was also in equilibrium.          The micrometer reading and the re
  sistance of the shunt were then set down as the results of the experi
 ment.
      The mean of twelve satisfactory experiments, at distances varying from
 '25 to '5 inch, gave for the ratio of the electromagnetic to the electrostatic
 unit of electricity——
                     v=27'79 Ohms, or B.A. units.
                       =277,900,000 metres per second.
                       = 174,800 statute miles per second.
     This value is considerably lower than that found by MM. Weber and
 Kohlrauseh by a different method, which was 310,740,000 metres per
second.      Its correctness depends on that of the B. A. unit of resistance,
which, however, cannot be very far from the truth, as it agrees so well with
Dr. Joule's thermal experiments.
     It is also decidedly less than any estimate of the velocity of light,
of which the lowest, that of M. Foucault, is 298,000,000 metres per
second.
     In  a note to  this paper the author gave his reasons, in as simple a form
as he could,    for believing that the ratio of the electrical units, and the ve
locity of light, are one and the same physical quantity, pointing out the
difference between his theory and those of MM. Riemann and Lorenz,
which appear to lead to the       same conclusion.

              the <U+FB01>rst place, there is no trace of a third line, and the second
              is more uncertain,     as though there were more than one fainter

X. " Notes         on Variations in the origin of the Long Buccal Branch
                                         ’
         of the Fifth Cranial Nerve.’ By \VM. TURNER, M.B. (Loud),
         Professor of Anatomy, University of Edinburgh.                 Communi
         cated by Dr. Snaarnr.          Received June 9, 1868.
     In the Journal of Anatomy and PhysiolOgy, November 1866,               I  gave a
 description of a specimen from the dissecting-room in which the long buc
 cal nerve, instead of proceeding frOm the third division of the <U+FB01>fth nerve,
 arose from the superior maxillary trunk in the spheno—maxillary fossa.
      This transposition of the origin of the nerve from its proper trunk to
 one which is sensory in function, seemed to me to be a strong additional
 argument, and from a new point of view, to those which had previously
 been urged by various writers on physiological and pathological             grounds,
 in favour of the purely sensory nature of this nerve.
      In a subject dissected during the month of March of the present year,
 variations of an interesting kind in connexion with this nerve were ob
 served, which a<U+FB01>'ord additional proof of its sensory nature.              _
      The occurrence within so short a period of two subjects presenting varia
  tions of so important a nature in their bearings on the much disputed ques
  tion of the physiology of this nerve, leads me to offer these notes to the Royal
  Society, in the hope that, if inserted in its Proceedings, the attention of
  anatomists may be more generally directed to the matter, and lead perhaps
  to further observations of a similar nature.
      When the superior maxillary trunk was eXposed on the left side of the
  head in the spheno-maxillary fossa, in addition to the orbital and palatine
  nerves usually arising from it in this locality, a branch of some size arose,
  which    descended   behind the posterior surface of the superior maxilla.        In
  its course    it  gave origin  to two    distinct superior   dental nerves,   which
  entered foramina      in the bone for the supply of the upper teeth.            The
  upper of these dental nerves was joined immediately before entering its
  foramen by another superior dental branch,         arising independently from the
   superior   maxillary trunk.     After giving origin to these superior dental
   nerves, the branch, now considerably diminished in size, passed downwards
   to the check, where some of its <U+FB01>bres pierced the substance of the bucci
   nator muscle at the spot where it is usual for the long buccal nerve to enter
   it, whilst others formed a distinct anastomosis with branches of the portio
   dura in the fat over the surface of Lthat muscle.           No buccal nerve from
   the inferior maxillary was observed on this side.          This arrangement cor
   responds almost exactly to the specimen above referred to, as described
                                                                       I
   in the Journal of Anatomy and Physiology, and the two are, beliet'e, the
   only examples of the kind up to this time recorded.
       On the right side of the same subject a different arrangement was ob
    served.   From the superior maxillary trunk in the spheno-maxillary fossa,
    in addition to its proper branches, two slender nerves arose, which passed
    obliquely downwards and forwards through the mass of fat beneath the ramus

1868.]       _
                   Buccal Branch   of the Fifth Cranial Nerve.                4557
of the jaw     and the anterior border of the masseter to the fat of the cheek,
where     they anastomosed with branches of the portio dura, and doubt
less   ended    in the integument.    These nerves represented,     I believe, the
branches which the long buccal nerve usually gives off before it enters the
buccinator muscle, and were the only parts of that nerve which arose on
this side of the head from the second division of the <U+FB01>fth. The remaining
part of the long buccal nerve arose from the inferior maxillary trunk and
entered the buccinator in the usual locality. When followed into the sub
 stance of the muscle, it passed obliquely and gave o<U+FB02>' branches of great
 delicacy, many of which were traced into the mucous membrane of the
 cheek.      Followed upwards to its origin, the long buccal nerve was seen to
 divide at the foramen ovale into two parts, of which one was traced with
 out di<U+FB01>iculty directly into the Gasserian ganglion, and must therefore be re
 garded as sensory ; the other, connected with the fasciculus, from which the
 temporal and masseteric nerves_arose, was followed upwards to the motor
 root of the <U+FB01>fth.       Almost immediately after receiving this offshoot from
 the motor root, the buccal nerve gave origin to the nervepf supply for the
 external     pterygoid muscle, and the <U+FB01>bres of the motor root were to all ap
 pearance prolonged directly into this pterygoid branch, whilst the <U+FB01>bres
 from the sensory ganglion could be distinctly traced into the proper buecsl
 part of the nerve.
     There can    be no doubt that in this case the entire buceal nerve on the left
 side was purely sensory.       There can also be no doubt that those branches
 arising   from   the superior maxillary trunk on the right side, which passed
 to the surface over the buccinator, were purely sensory.          The remaining
 part of the right nerve also, though connected with the motor root of the
 <U+FB01>fth, yet parted to all appearance with its motor <U+FB01>bres before it proceeded
 to its destination.
     I  may take this opportunity of referring to a case of variation in the
                                                    I
 origin of the buccal nerve, which, so far as know, has not yet been re
 ferred to by British anatomists, and which gives additional evidence of the
 sensory nature of the nerve.       In the Bulletins de la Soc. Anat. de Paris,
                                                         ‘
  1853, S. 109 (quoted in Krause und Telgmann Die Nerven-Varietiiten,’
 Leipzig, 1868), M. Gaillet describes the nerve as arising directly from the

XI. “Description      of  a Peudulum-Electrograph        now in use at the Mel
       bourne Observatory.”         By R. L.   J. ELLERY, Government Astro
        nomer to the Colony of Victoria.          Communicated by Banrorm
        S'rnwaa'r, Esq., F.R.S.       Received May 23, 1868.
                                     (Plate 11.)
    About eighteen months since, being desirous of making some improve
ments in our mode of observing atmospheric electricity, I tried' a series
of experiments with Sir William Thomson’s various methods of obtaining
observations and measures of the electric state of the atmosphere; the re
sults of these were so very satisfactory that I had a divided-ring re<U+FB02>ecting
electrometer made, as nearly similar as possible, judging from the descrip
tions available, to those used by himself.         This was attached to a water
dropping collector, and I obtained the de<U+FB02>ections of the needle measured by
means of a telescope and re<U+FB02>ected scale.         Prior to this, all observations of
atmospheric electricity were made with Quetelet’s modi<U+FB01>cation of the Pel
tier electrometcr, where the needle and its little directing magnet are sus
pended by a cocoon <U+FB01>bre instead of on a point.          The use of this, however,
was very troublesome, involving its being carried to the highest part of the
building at every observation, brought down, and placed on its stand within
doors, the needle brought to rest by a magnet, and, after reading off the
force of repulsion, the ascertaining of the character of the electricity by a.
separate operation.      After using the divided-ring electrometer for a few
weeks, it became apparent that no method of observing atmospheric elec
tricity that was not continuous could possibly afford results that would
embrace the numerous and rapid changes which take place.               I found also
in observing with the divided-ring electrometer that the torsion of the pla
tinum wire was uncertain, requiring very frequent alteration of the zero
point, especially after great disturbances.
    I  therefore endeavoured to devise an electrograph that should act by
 gravity instead of torsion; and for this purpose the electrometers of Sir
 \V.  Thomson and the photographic registration method adopted in the Kew
 magnetographs afforded me a suf<U+FB01>cient groundwork. In August last I so far
 succeeded as to obtain regular photographic curves of the electric condition
 of the air about l8 feet from the earth’s surface; experience of the <U+FB01>rst
 temporary apparatus suggested modi<U+FB01>cations;            and in November an im
proved instrumeut was erected, of which a brief description was read before
the Royal Society of Victoria in December.           Some defects in the perform
 ance of this, however, led to even a further modi<U+FB01>cation; and since Decem
ber last the improved     electrograph has performed most satisfactorily.
    Plate   II. will explain   its construction.    It may be generally described
 as  consisting of—

                             5. Lifting-cradle.
                             6. Outer metallic cover.
                             7.  Charging-apparatus.
    l . Reservoir qulectricity.—On       an octagonal slab of slate 1 inch thick and
15 inches from side to side, is <U+FB01>xed an ordinary Leyden jar, A ; to the inside
bottom of this jar, and in connexion with its inside coating, is <U+FB01>xed a pillar
of brass tube reaching to about the level of the mouth of the jar ; to the
top of this is <U+FB01>xed the support (12) for the moveable part with its mirror.
Connected with the pillar, and projecting upwards and outwards beyond
the top of the jar, is a branch of metal terminating in a ring (d), to facilitate
charging    the Leyden jar.
     The support of the moveable part will be best understood by reference to
the Plate, where it is marked d ; it consists of a Z-shapcd piece of brass
attached to the top of the pillar with a central screw and three set screws,
by means of which the surface (e) upon which the moveable part rests may
be set quite level.( The surface (e) is of polished hardened steel about 1 inch
long and } inch broad, dovetailed into the brass Z-piece.
     2. The Pendulum.—The moveable or sensitive part (P), which may be
called the pendulum, has its centre of gravity and point of suspension nearly
coincident.     It consists, <U+FB01>rst, of a mirror-frame (f) and knife-edge (g) with
counterpoise (h), needle (1') with its counterpoise (       and balance-screw
The     mirror, a piece of  silvered parallel glass about 1 inch  square, is clamped
 on to its frame by two little clips; the knife-edge (g) is of hardened steel, and
 is <U+FB01>xed as nearly as possible in a plane with the silvered surface of the
 mirror; the counterpoise brings the centre of gravity of the whole nearly to
 the centre of the knife-edge.
     The needle is a piece of No. 16 aluminium wire <U+FB01>xed to the back of the
 mirror-frame,     projecting vertically upwards for about 4 inches from the
 level of the knife-edge, and terminating in a piece of thin sheet aluminium
 (a) about 1% inch long and % inch wide, bent to a curve of 4 inches radius
 and <U+FB01>xed to the wire at right angles to the plane of the mirror, and with
 the chord of its curvature at right angles to the wire itself.         The counter
                                 j
 poise to this is found at ; a small brass wire, screwed, projects down
  wards from the frame and carries a small weight, which can be adjusted
  by screwing up and down the wire so as to obtain the required sensitiveness
  of the pendulum.         The balance—screw (k) is a piece of small brass wire
  screwed its whole length, terminating at each end in a little capstan head.
  It is attached at right angles to the frame and perpendicular to the plane
 of the mirror by means of a small stud (I), through which it can be screwed
  in order to adjust the whole pendulum to the required verticality.
      3. Electrodes.—Firmly        <U+FB01>xed to the slate base are two stout pillars of
  brass (m, m), zit-inch diameter and 20 inches high ; these are connected at the
  top by a bridge of stout brass (n), to the centre of which a block of ebonitc
  carrying the electrodes (0, o') is <U+FB01>rmly screwed. These consist of two seg

 460           Mr. R. L.  J. Ellery  on a Pendulum-Electrograpb.              [June 18,
  ments of a ring of brass of 4% inside and about 4% outside radius, and % of
  an inch wide; they are <U+FB01>rmly screwed to the ebonite so as to form together
  a true arch, but with the end at the vertex separated by about T15. of an inch,
  care being taken that they are perfectly insulated from one another and
  from all other parts.     Attached to each electrode is a stout brass wire (pp')_
 projecting upwards and ending in a ring*.
      4. Charge-measurer.——On the aluminium stem of the pendulum, and
  about two-thirds of the distance between the centre of the mirror and the
  curved piece of aluminium from the former, is a disk of gilded mica (g), 5 an
  inch in diameter with its plane parallel to that of the mirror; <U+FB01>xed to the
  outer metal case (to be described) is a sliding-tube and screw (r), through
 which passesa steel wire (a) terminating inside the case with a disk of sheet
 brass 1 inch diameter.         This is so arranged that the wire disk can be
 pushed free through the sliding-tube and <U+FB01>xed with the disk at any de<U+FB01>
 nite distance from the mica disk; while a further and gradual approach is
 made with the sliding-tube and screw, both of which are divided ; the wire is
 graduated to inches, the tube and screw together measuring to 613 of an inch.
 The large disk, when withdrawn, rests against the side of the covering case
  6 inches from the needle. The screw is a four-threaded one with six turns
 to the inch, and is suf<U+FB01>ciently long to allow of 2 inches” motion of the
 sliding-tube.
      5. Lifting-Cradle.—This consists of a cradle analogous to the lifting
 apparatus of a good chemical balance.              It lifts the pendulum at three
 points; one is a V, a prolongation of the knife-edge, the other two are
 formed by the arms of the balance-wire; the cradle (M) is <U+FB01>xed to a piece
 of ebonite (t) projecting from a tube (u) which slides on one of the pillars,
 which can be moved up and down to the required extent by a screw (0 v)
 passing upwards through the bridge.            This screw is worked by a key (10)
 through     the top of the  outer case.    The   cradle is set upon the ebonite with
 adjusting screws, so that it can be made to lift the pendulum            quite symme
 trically, and lower it without setting it vibrating.
     6. The outer metallic     coven—a'ra: is      a  cylinder of copper 22 inches
 high and     12 inches diameter,   covered at the top.        It has a <U+FB02>ange (N) of
 brass at the bottom which is ground <U+FB02>at and <U+FB01>ts almost air-tight on the
 slate slab; three studs <U+FB01>nd their places in three holes in the slab and
 keep it in position.       In front of the mirror is the window (W) of the
cylinder, which is closed by a piece of parallel plate-glass, and covered out
side by a metal plate having two tubular openings, to which are <U+FB01>tted the
telescope and dark channel for leading the slit of light to the mirror and
thence to the cylinder, as in the case of the Kew magnetographs.                  At the
back and opposite the window is the charging-hole (3;); this is an opening
lined with ebonite and having a cap to screw on outside.                Above the win
dow, the sliding-tube and screw of the charge-measurer              (r a) is <U+FB01>xed.     On
    “
       Adopting Sir W. Thomson's plan,   I have since covered all the ebonite or vulcanite
parts with para<U+FB02>in with great improvement in insulation.

the top of the cylinder are two tubular aperture lined with plugs of ebo
nite, through which the external parts of the electrodes pass.                     The key
for lifting the pendulum is also <U+FB01>tted on the top of the case.
     7. The chafging-appafatus.—This consists of an ordinary electrophorus,
 and of a rod of wire covered with guttu perch'a or ebonite, terminating at
 one end in a brass knob, at the other in a projection of unnovered metal for
 placing in contact with the ring which projects from the Leyden jar pillar.
 '
     The air inside the cylinder is kept perfectly dry by tWo leaden trays, con
 taining lumps of pumice-stone saturated with sulphuric acid‘.
     The arrangement of light, cylinder for photograph~paper and clockwork,
 as also of the reading-telescope and scale, are in all respects similar to those
 adopted for the vertical-force magnetograph of Kew, and described in the
 Report of the British Association for 1859.
     The water-dropping apparatus is of the same kind as described by Sir W.
 Thomson in N ichol’s Cyclopeedia (1860, art. “Atmospheric Electricity”).
 The cistern contains about twenty-eight gallons, which is found to give the
 requisite stream for about thirty hours.            It is a copper Vessel, 2 feet square
 and 1 foot high.         Keeping it shallow avoids much alteration of head of
 water, and consequently secures a more regular stream 8 this tank rests
 _upon four ebonite insulators indoors. A copper pipe ending ina <U+FB01>ne nozzle
 passes through a hole in the glass of the window, and projects to about four
 feet beyond the Wall of the building; the tank is connected with the elec
 trometer in another chamber by means of a copper wire very thickly covered
  with gutta percha.
      The mode of using the whole apparatus may be thus describod.                       The
  Leyden jar or reservoir is <U+FB01>rst charged by a fist? good sparks from the elec
  trophorus; to do this the cover of the opening (y) is rEmoved and the
  charging-rod inserted so that the bare end rests on the ring (c). The
  sparks from the electrophorus are then passed to the brass knob, which
  projects a few inches outside the case.           The rod is then withdrawn and the
  opening closed.        The act of charging generally sets the pendulum oscilla
  ting; it soon comes to rest, however.          An hour after charging l have gene
   rally  found   the charge su<U+FB02>iciently permanent for commencing registration.
   The two electrodes are then connected with the earth; in a minute the
   reading of the re<U+FB02>ected scale will give what may be styled charge-zero,
   which is always di<U+FB02>‘erent from the zero-reading before charging the jar,
   the latter being the reading of the position of rest of the pendulum (which,
   by the bye, I make so sensitiVe as to vibrate about once a second).                    The
   charge has now to be measured in terma of the slide and screw.                      To do
   this, the wire is <U+FB01>rst pushed in till the disk is at some de<U+FB01>nite distance from
   the pendulum-disk; to admit of this being done precisely and quickly, a
      * It is necessary that the sulphuric acid be quite pure, for nitric acid is often an im
   purity in commercial samples, which soon corrodes all the parts.       To aVOid this, it is
   best to heat the sulphuric acid wall in a platinum dish and. drive off all the nitrous
   fumes.

small step (z) is <U+FB01>xed on the rim, and when the stop is home and the screw
and slide reading two inches, the disks will be exactly two inches apart.
The disk is then gradually approached by means of the screw until, by the
attraction exerted upon the pendulum                      and consequent movement         of       the
mirror, the reading of the scale has altered any de<U+FB01>nite but small amount
(say, =10') ; the indices of the slide and screw are then noted and entered
as the charge-reading.      The photographic cylinder is now adjusted to its
place, and the dot of light falling on it ascertained to be of its proper bright?
ness; for after charging and after great atmospheric disturbances the pen
dulum will be found to have shifted, slightly displacing the dot laterally,
and rendering it weak and unde<U+FB01>ned; a gentle lifting and lowering of the
pendulum, however, by means of the lifting-apparatus and screw sets this
right immediately.
   The air-electrode (p) is now disconnected from the earth, but              left      11'   is
connected; the needle then assumes slightly different position, which after
                                                     a

                 is
This position becomes also photographed, and will appear as short but               a
undisturbed line on the sheet.       At the end of the <U+FB01>ve minutes the wire
leading to the water-dropper     attached and the whole left for twenty-four
                                           is
hours; at the expiration of this period the tank    detached, and <U+FB01>ve mi
                                                                  is
nutes after the earth-reading taken and entered as before.     The two elec
trodes are then connected and the charge measured, the light and barrel
readjusted for the second day’s curve, scale-reading observed and entered
again, and so on for the next twenty-four hours.
   The curves show at the commencement and end of each day     short                    a
straight line already referred to, and corresponding to the mirror’s
position for the earth-reading;    line drawn from one to the other of
                                                 a
these gives the zero or base-line for the day; any loss in the charge of
the jar, which   assumed to be proportional to the time,
                  is                                      thus accounted   is
for;  for the line will be inclined to the edge of the sheet in proportion to
the loss in the twenty-four hours.      In the case of this electrometer, the
charge of the jar being positive, and the front electrode being the one con
nected with the air,   positive charge will raise the re<U+FB02>ected beam of light,
                            a
and    negative one lower it; so that the curve above this zero-line indicates
       a

<U+FB01>cient de<U+FB02>ection is caused to alter the scale-reading (say, 10') from the zero,
and the indication of the slide-tube and screw noted as charge-reading.                 The
electrodes are now disconnected from the earth and connected with the
l2-cell battery, one with one pole and one with the other, and the de<U+FB02>ection

The charge-reading is now obtained again, as well as the zero-reading.

   The reading for battery in <U+FB01>rst positions differs from zero by +5'1 divi.
sions, and in the second by —5'8 divisions.                 A de<U+FB02>ection of 5'45 divisions
is therefore equal to twelve Daniell’s cells when the charge-reading is
940.    The charge is now reduced and the same process is gone through.
This is repeated for eight or ten degrees of charge; and by this means we
obtain a set of readings of the amount of de<U+FB02>ection caused by a l2-cell
battery for various states of the charge, as well as arbitrary measures of the
charge by the screw- and slide-tube.

charge   of  the reservoir.
    This apparatus has scarcely been in use for a suf<U+FB01>ciently extended period
to allow of any reliable deductions being made as to the existence of laws
in the variations of the force of atmospheric electricity. or of any relations
that may exist between this and. other meteorological phenomena.                 Some
facts however. can be already gathered from the curves nbtained.                These
are, <U+FB01>rst, the periods of manima and minima, which are most distinctly
shown.      The former occurs at from 6" 30‘“ to 8h 30‘n A.M., the latter at
from 1 P.1d. to 3 11.11.        A second maximum at from 9 to 10 P.M., and a
 second minimum at from midnight to 2 A.M. are also indioated.
    The greatest disturbances take place during our northerly winds, especi
 ally in dry hot weather, when a very great negative tension often occurs,
 so strong as to be beyond the measuring-power           of the instrument, in which
 case sparks may be generally obtained from the airqaleetrode.              The usual
 turning   of  the wind   from    N. to  S.W.  is always accompanied      for  a short
 period by an almost equally high positive tension, but during strong and
 hot northerly winds the high negative tension lasts as long as the wind
 blows strong and dry.

        Communicated by Dr. F. Smsorv, F.R.S.               Received June 18,
        1868.
                                   (Abstract)
    The starting-point in the inquiry has been the two           following pos
tulates   :—
    1. That there must be some relation between the substance administered
and the animal organism, on which the effects depend.
    2. That, so far as the substance is concerned, the basis of the relation
can only be its chemical properties, using the term in its widest sense.
    From these postulates follow certain corollaries :—
     1. That the physiological   and therapeutic action of the same substance
must be similar in kind.
    2. That the action of food, remedies, and poisons must be capable of
 explanation on the same principles.
    3. That substances chemically allied should have similar physiological
and therapeutic actions, or any diversity found to exist should be capable
 of explanation on chemical grounds,
    The second of these deductions is taken as a guide in the present inquiry.
 Something    is known as to the uses of the various classes of foods in the
 economy, and of the mode in which they subserve these uses; this know
 ledge may be applied in the endeavour to ascertain the mode of action 9f
 poisons.
    The operations taking place in the animal organism may be divided
into two great classes :—(a) for maintenance of structure, ([3)ifor evolution
 of force.    While mutually interdependent, they are distinct, and in cha
 racter essentially antagonistic, structural and chemical elaboration on the
 one hand, oxidation   or disintegration  on the other.
    The two great classes of food, organic and mineral, are in close relation
 with these. The organic foods build up the tissues, but ultimately undergo
 oxidation and yield force.     The inorganic foods take a subordinate part
 in the composition of the textures ; they do not yield force by oxidation,
  but they in<U+FB02>uence the nutritive processes.       So also the organic remedies
  and poisons a<U+FB01>'ect the evolution of force, mineral substances the organic
  processes.
  '
     (The action of mineral matters has been noticed elsewhere.)

466             Dr. W. H. Broadbent       on {he Action   of Poisons.    [June 18,
   The force evolved in the animal organism takes the form of heat, motion,
and nervous action ; but there are very important points of di<U+FB01>'erence be
tween heat on the one hand and nervo-muscular action on the other, both
as to the part they take in the vital processes, and in the conditions of
their evolution.
    It is through their action on the nervous system that the powerful
organic poisons destroy life; and in order to understand this action, it is
necessary to consider closely the evolution of nerve-force, and to endeavour
to realize the chemical conditions implied.
    In the <U+FB01>rst place, the source of nerve-force is oxidation, and the seat of
the oxidation      is the nervous structures.      This is generally admitted, and
seems     to be conclusively     established   by  an  analysis of the phenomena
observed in experiments with a prepared frog’s leg.
   This admitted, it is to be noted—
    1. That nerve-action is intermittent and of varying intensity, and that
in addition to the presence of the oxygen brought to the nerve-structures
by the blood, an impulse from without, or from some other part of the
nervous system, is necessary to determine the evolution of the force.
    2. Again, there is a storing up of potential energy in the nervous struc
tures   ; witness the necessity for sleep, &c.
    3.  A   due supply of oxygen is required.         The phenomena of asphyxia
show that the      demand   is most  urgent  in the  hemispherical ganglia.
    These facts indicate that the constituent of the nervous structures by
oxidation     of which the force is yielded, possesses what      I have ventured to
 call  chemical   tension, a  property   which  does  not belong   to non-nitrogen
ized matter, or to all nitrogenized matter.           It will be further explained
later; for the present, it is suf<U+FB01>cient to refer to nitroglycerine as an ex
treme example.
    The protagon of Liebreich, and the neurine recently identi<U+FB01>ed by Wurtz,
with hydrate of trimethyl-oxethyl-ammonium, have this characteristic in
a certain degree.
    Turning now to the poisons which kill by their powerful action on the
nervous system.        They all contain nitrogen, and all possess chemical ten
sion ; and these seem to be the only points common to the entire group.
    Nitrogen cannot be the poisonous element; it has no great chemical
energy,      and  it is present in large proportion in substances which are
inert.     It  is nevertheless the pivot on which the deadly in<U+FB02>uence turns.
Its   a<U+FB01>inity for H, O, and especially for C, is only feeble. When, therefore,
in  a molecule containing      0, H, and N, or C, H, N and O, the elements are
not so arranged that the mutual af<U+FB01>nities of C, H, and O cooperate to
maintain the integrity of the molecule ; there may be a more or less powerful
tendency on the part of C, H, and O to rearrange themselves without re
gard to the N, or to combine with O or H2 0 if presented.              This is what
is meant by the term chemical tension.           In the example given, nitrogly
cerine {0,H,(NO,),O,}, the dislocation is of 0 from N in favour of C and

1868.]            Dr.   WV.   H. Broadbent      on the Action     of Poisons.                   467
H.    Equally striking examples of dislocation of N from C or 11 cannot
be given, and it isnot easy in all cases to point out the source of the tension.
A very important method in which the balance of af<U+FB01>nities is deranged
and   the condition   of tension brought about, is by departure from
a stable type, as, for instance, in the nitrite bases, which are residues
derived from ammonium-salts      by dehydration.    To this class belong
morphia,   strychnia, brucia, and most poisonous alkaloids.    Additional
interest is given to these compounds by the fact that Dr. Crum Brown
and Dr. Fraser have shown that, by introduction into the molecule of
methyl-iodide, carrying back the constitution      a step in the direction of
the ammonium      type,  the  poisonous effects are greatly diminished, and
entirely altered in character.
  Let the deduction as to the evolution of nerve-force be accepted, and we
have in the introduction into the blood of substances having varying degrees
and directions of tension an intelligible method of in<U+FB02>uencing its mani
festations.
    Looking now upon nerve-action as a result of oxidation, in the various
methods     by which this oxidation may be in<U+FB02>uenced, analogies may be
 traced with conditions which affect ordinary combustion.       These condi
                                                                   i
tions are—
    1. The supply of oxygen.
    2. The character of the combustible.
    3. The presence of products of combustion, or of bodies having a
similar in<U+FB02>uence.
    It is of course necessary to bear in mind the peculiarities of the oxida
tion yielding nerve-force, the di<U+FB01>'erences between combustion and oxidation
in the moist state, and the special modifying conditions of the animal
organism.     For example, while in asphyxia the deprivation of oxygen
arrests all nervous action, the respiration of undiluted oxygen does not
intensify   it,either because the blood will only take up        certain pro
                                                                          a
portion of oxygen, or more probably because the effects of the            are          O
expended in altering the blood, which
                  ‘
                                              thus oxidized instead of being
                                                    is
oxygenated.
  The analogies to the above conditions found in the action of substances
on the nervous system are—
    l.The liberation in the nascent state  the nervous structures of
                                                    in                and                  C

equivalent to the exclusion of O. The      and H are set free

likely to occur, as       never present in an organic body in excess of

nation here given of the action of prussic acid.    Stated more explicitly,
this explanation is, that the prussic acid    carried by the blood to the

bear upon         it   (af<U+FB01>nities which  normally determine the oxidation by which
nerve-force        is     evolved), its elements are dislocated from each other, and
the   C    and    H     liberated in the latent condition appropriate the   destined   O
for the evolution of nerve-force which     thus arrested.

                                 is   the  composition of hydrocyanic acid,

will permit its elements to exercise their individual af<U+FB01>nity for O,   indi                is
cated      by
         its spontaneous decomposition in water, by its position as nitrile                a

  The phenomena by poisoning                     by
                                    prussic acid are perfectly consistent
with this view. All observers have noted their similarity to those of
asphyxia.
   Still more            striking     is the fact that arti<U+FB01>cial respiration, and espe
cially with oxygen,              is   the great means of neutralizing the effects of this
poison.
   Probably this chain of facts would be considered conclusive, were      not                  it
that the hypothesis as to the mode of death by H Cy          paralysis of the
                                                                            is
respiratory movements.    This hypothesis, however, still leaves unexplained
the cause of the paralysis itself, and therefore the real mode of action of
the poison.   It           is,
                   moreover, inconsistent with certain of the phenomena                             ;
the respiratory nerve-centres are actually the last to be paralyzed, except
those concerned in the action of the heart.
  Experiments nevertheless have been made for the purpose of ascertaining
whether the previous respiration of undiluted oxygen would retard, or in

any measure prevent the actiOn of prussic acid.         The results have been by
no means uniform; but instances have occurred (rats being the animals
used) in which, after the injection of an overwhelming            dose, the fatal
effect has been delayed quite beyond the operation of accidental causes;
and again, in which a dose fatal to two rats, and barely survived, after a
long train of symptoms, by one other, produced comparatively little effect
on another after the respiration of oxygen.
    It has been found also that a proportion of prussic acid diffused in
equal volumes of air and of oxygen, has a decidedly less powerful action
on the animal in the latter case.
    With frogs the results were most contradictory and embarrassing, till it
was discovered that prussic acid injected under the skin had scarcely any
action on them. But if they were subsequently placed under a glass shade,
or in some other con<U+FB01>ned atmosphere, into which the acid diffused, it
would gradually affect them.         It seems probable that the af<U+FB01>nities in
operation in the nervous structures of the frog are not suf<U+FB01>ciently energetic
to determine the decomposition of the H Cy, which will _then act upon
this animal as an anaesthetic.
    Nitroglycerine was at <U+FB01>rst made the subject of experiment, under the
idea that possibly oxygen might be evolved from the NO,. which is
substituted for three equivalents of H in the typical molecule.              Sub
sequent re<U+FB02>ection       showed that this is not likely to occur; but the
fact remains, that it is a substance liable to change, and very highly
charged with oxygen, as compared with the ordinary contituents of the
body.
    It  is a very powerful poison, having, however, entirely different      effects
on frogs and rats.
    In  frogs it very speedily induces powerful tetanic convulsions (a single
drop of    a solution of one pint of nitroglycerine in four parts of methyl in
alcohol placed on the back of a frog is followed in <U+FB01>ve or eight minutes by
stiffness of movement, and in thirteen to sixteen minutes by most violent
spasms).      In rats an hour or more elapses before any symptom is manifest,
and then death is by a gradually increasing feebleness of movement, in
two or three hours, without convulsion.
    It is unquestionable that this di<U+FB01>'erence in the effects has a relation with
the oxygen contained in the nitroglycerine.          The contrast with prussic
acid in the action on warm and cold-blooded animals is suggested.
    A   very extended and comprehensive inquiry, both as to the conditions
in the nervous system associated with convulsions, tetanus, delirium, &c.,
and into the relations      and constitution    of the poisons which give rise
to these symptoms, is necessary before the second analogy can be followed
out with any con<U+FB01>dence.         Experiments are being made with substances of
known composition        and constitution,   with  a view to elucidate   this part
of   the question.
    In conclusion,    two points are considered which cannot be passed over in
                                                                   2 s 2

any attempt to apply the principles of physical and chemical science to
the case of poisons.
   The <U+FB01>rst is as to the minuteness of the fatal dose. Any explanation,
before it can be accepted, must show that the cause is adequate to produce
the effect.  This is a dif<U+FB01>culty in the path of any rational explanation. It
is attempted to meet it by showing, on the one hand, that the equivalency
of nerve-forceis extremely small, by reference to its analogy with electrical
currents, and by other considerations, and that therefore the degree of
chemical change involved in its evolution is also small ; and, on the other
hand,   the maximum of force to be obtained from an organic body is
through the exercise of the af<U+FB01>nities of its individual elements.
   The second point is as to the special action of certain poisons on par
ticular nervous centres,—strychnia   on the cord, morphia on the brain, &c.,
the substances being carried by the blood to all alike.  It is as necessary
to explain why no effect is produced on those centres, or tracts which do
not suffer, as to explain the action on the one which does.   The explana
tion is sought in the fact that the difference in the functional activity of
the brain and cord, the need for sleep by the brain, not experienced, at any
rate in the same degree, by the cord, point to a difference of tension, and
                                                                              '
therefore          of relation with
                           the substances which act as poisons.   This con
sideration will apply where the differences of susceptibility and of tension
are not so marked.
   But this is only part of a still wider question—the different action of
poisons on different classes of animals.  The explanation is still the same.
Difference in the functional energy or activity of corresponding nerve
centres implies difference of tension.
   The following facts bear strikingly on this point :—
    1. Anaesthetics affect all classes of animals alike,    e. when the effect
                                                                    1'.
is   ageneral arrest of oxidation.
   2. Strychnia, which acts on the cord, affects all animals alike.      The
spinal system       the  centre
                        is      which    most similar
                                                 is   in its endowments in all
classes of vertebrates.
   3. The poisons which have the most diverse action on different animals
are such as in man act on the cerebral ganglia.

   some curious experiments which show the singular incapacity of' hydrogen
   either pure or mixed with air, for receiving and conveying vibrations from
   a bell rung in the gas.    The facts elicited by these experiments seem not
  hitherto to have received a satisfactory explanation.
      It occurred to the author of the present paper that they admitted of a
  ready explanation as a consequence of the high velocity of propagation of
  sound in hydrogen gas operating in a peculiar way.               When a body is
  slowly   moved  to and  fro in  any gas,  the gas  behaves  almost exactly like an
  incompressible <U+FB02>uid, and there is merely alocal reciprocating motion of the
  gas from the anterior to the posterior region, and back again in the oppo
  site phase of the body’s    motion,    in which the region that had been ante
  rior  becomes  posterior.    If the rate  of alternation of the body’s motion be
  taken greater and greater, or, in other words, the periodic time less and
 less, the condensation       and rarei'action of the gas, which in the <U+FB01>rst
 instance was utterly insensible, presently becomes sensible, and sound
 waves (or waves of the same nature in case the periodic time be beyond
 the limits of audibility) are produced, and exist along with the local reci
 procating <U+FB02>ow. As the periodic time is diminished, more and more of the
 encroachment of the vibrating body on the gas goes to produce a true
 sound-wave, less and less a mere local reciprocating <U+FB02>ow.             For a given
 periodic time, and given size, form, and mode of vibration of the vibrating
 body, the gas behaves so much the more nearly like an incompressible <U+FB02>uid
 as the velocity of propagation        of sound in it is greater; and on this
 account the intensity    of the sonorous vibrations excited in air as compared
 with hydrogen may be vastly greater than corresponds merely with the dif
 ference of density of the two gases.
     It is only for a few simple geometrical forms of the vibrating body that
 the solution of the problem of determining the motion produced in the gas
 can actually be e<U+FB01>'ected.       The author has given the solution in the two
cases of a vibrating sphere and of an in<U+FB01>nite cylinder, the motion in the
latter case being supposed to take place in two dimensions.             The former
is taken as the representative of a bell; the latter is applied to the case of
a vibrating string or wire. In the case of the sphere, the numerical results
amply establish the adequacy of the cause here considered to account for
the results obtained by Leslie.         In the case of the cylinder they give an
exalted idea of the necessity of sounding-boards in stringed instruments;
and the theory is further applied to the explanation of one or two inter
esting phenomena.

XV. “An Account of certain Experiments, on Aneroid Baro
    meters, made at Kew Observatory, at the expense of the
    Meteorological Committee.”   By B. STEWART. C0mmuni~
    cated by the Meteorological Committee. Received June 3,
      1868.
   In judging of the value of an instrument, such as an aneroid, it is not
the mere extent of difference between its indications and those of a standard
barometer that ought to guide us; but it is rather the constancy of its
indications under the various circumstances to which it may be subjected,
that determines its value.
   An   aneroid    may diii'er from a standard barometer         at the ordinary
 pressure,  and  to  a greater extent at other pressures ; but  provided  these dif
 ferences  can  be  well ascertained  and  remain   constant,  such  an instrument
'ought to be regarded as valuable, just as much as a chronometer of known
constancy, but of which the rate is wrong.                      .
  The circumstances which may be supposed to affect the indications                of an
aneroid may be classed under three heads, namely :—
          (1) Time.
          (2) Temperature.
          (3) Sudden variations of pressure.
  (1) Time.-——0f the in<U+FB02>uence of time, I am not able to say much; Captain
Henry Toynbee has allowed me to examine the various readings of an
aneroid, which he carried about with him for many years in his voyages,
and constantly compared with a standard barometer.
  This aneroid (which I shall call No. I) was between 4 and 5 inches in
diameter, and was compensated for temperature.
   In July    1860, as compared with a standard barometer, it read 0025 in.
too low.      In September 1862 it read (at the same temperature) about
0012 in. too low;      while in March 1864 (still at the same temperature)
it read about 0020     in. too low.
   This instrument, which was well cared for, and which, being used chie<U+FB02>y
on the surface of the ocean, was subjected neither to a very great not to a
very sudden change of pressure, must be allowed to have retained its cha
meter with great constancy.
  This is the only de<U+FB01>nite information      regarding the effect of time on these
instruments    which   I   have received.
   (2) Temperature.—A good aneroid is generally compensated byits maker
for the e<U+FB02>‘ects of temperature, and the question to be investigated          is,
                                                                       to*what
extent such compensations are trustworthy.      I record the results (obtained
at the Kew Observatory)    of subjecting       six ancroids,    each   4%-   inches    in
diameter, made by two different makers,        to   a   very considerable     range    of
temperature.

    These results are, on the whole, very satisfactory, and appear to show
that a well-made compensated instrument has its indications comparatively
little affected by  a very considerable temperature change.
    It ought always to be borne in mind that an aneroid is not capable of
being read to the same accuracy as a standard barometer, and that the
1+0-   of an inch is a very small quantity.              These temperature experi
ments were made at the ordinary atmospheric pressure.
    I am unable to say what effect a change of temperature would have at a
diminished pressure.
    (3) Sudden chanyes prressure.—-A preliminary investigation, made at
the request of Mr. De La Rue, into the behaviour of an aneroid belonging
to the Italian Government, seemed to show considerable error at low pres
sures.    For the purpose of investigating the in<U+FB02>uence of sudden changes
of pressure upon the indications of aneroids, I then applied to some of the
best known makers of these instruments, for the loan of several, and
through their courtesy in lending me a suf<U+FB01>cient number, and for a suf—
<U+FB01>ciently long time,    I have   been enabled to investigate this in<U+FB02>uence at some
length.
    In the following experiments, the instruments were, to begin with, sus
pended vertically, at the usual atmospheric pressure.               They were tapped
before being read.       The pressure was then lowered an inch, and the in
strument allowed to remain ten minutes at this pressure before being read,
after having again been well tapped.
    The pressure was thus reduced an inch every time, being allowed to
remain ten minutes at each stage; the instrument was always well tapped
before being read, by means of an arrangement contrived for this purpose
by Mr. R. Beckley.          The exhaustion was carried downwards to 19 inches
in the case of those instruments in which the scale was suf<U+FB01>ciently great,
and the instrument was allowed to remain an hour and a half at its
lowest pressure   ;   the air was then admitted an inch at a time, the previous
arrangement as to time and tapping being followed.

    jected to a decrease of pressure similar to that to which they were subjected
     in these experiments—
         (1) That        a well-constructed       large aneroid will not go far wrong down
     to 24 inches, but after that pressure its reading will be considerably lower
     than that of a standard barometer, so that a large positive correction will
     have to be applied.
         (2) That small aneroids are less trustworthy than large ones, and pro
     bably cannot be trusted below 26 inches.
         (3) That if previous experiments are made upon an aneroid, we are
     enabled by this means to obtain a table of corrections which, when applied
     to future observations with the same instrument, will most probably pre
     sent us with a much better result than had we not veri<U+FB01>ed our instrument
     at all, and that by this means we may use our instrument down to 19
     inches with very good results.
         Let us now consider the up readings of these instruments, and let us
     suppose that each instrument is right to begin with, that is to say, while
     remaining an hour and a half at its lowest reading.
         These corrections and up readings are exhibited                            in the       following

        We may learn from these results that       aneroids which have been sub  if
    jected   for at least one hour and   half to the lowest pressures which they
                                                                 a
     register, have the pressure increased by means of the gradual introduction
    of air into the receiver, after the manner already described.
              (1) That a well-constructed large aneroid will not go far wrong for
             about         8   inches above the lowest pressure.                                                             I
                (2) That in this respect small aneroids are somewhat less trust
             worthy than large ones.
                (3) That     the instrument read be previously tested and its cor
                                     if
             rections ascertained, we may consider     trustworthy (making use of       it
             these corrections) for up readings throughout    greater range than                         a                                          if

        It thus  appears that if an instrument reads correctly before it is put into
    the receiver it will read too low immediately afterwards, and that it may
    be some considerable time before it recovers its previous reading.                           The
    instrument    cannot, therefore, be safely trusted for absolute determinations
    if it has been recently exposed to rapid changes of pressure.
        The experiments hitherto recorded, in which an inch of pressure has been
     taken away or added every ten minutes, are perhaps analogous to ascents
     in  a balloon, or descents from a mountain; they are not, however, pre
     cisely analogous to mountain ascents, since a longer time than 10 minutes
     is usually taken to produce a change of pressure equal to 1 inch.
        At the suggestion of Mr. Charles Brooke, a couple of aneroids were
     tested in April 1868, with the view of rendering the experiment more
     analogous to a mountain ascent.
        The pressure was reduced by half an inch at a time and at intervals                        of
     30 minutes, the aneroids being well tapped.
        The following corrections were obtained for down readings (instruments
     supposed right at 30 inches).

    These     results,  when compared with the previous determinations              for
these same instruments, would seem to show              that a somewhat   better result
is obtained when the exhaustion           is carried on more slowly, and hence that
the corrections depend, to a considerable extent, on the nature of the treat
ment received. No. 8 seems to be more constant under di<U+FB01>‘erent treatment
than No. 9.
    From all these experiments we may perhaps conclude as follows :—
    (l) A good aneroid of large size may be corrected for temperature by
an optician, so that the residual correction shall be very small.
    (2 u)   If  an aneroid correct, to commence with, be used for a balloon          or
mountain       ascent, it will be tolerably correct for a decrease   of about 6 inches
 of pressure.
    (2 B) A large aneroid is more likely to incorrect than a small one.
    (2 7) The range of correctness of an instrument                used for mountain
 ascents may be increased by          a previous veri<U+FB01>cation, a table of corrections
 being thus obtained.
    (3 a)   If  an aneroid have remained some time at the top of a mountain,
 and be supposed correct to start with, then it will give good results for
 about 8 inches of increase of pressure.
     (3 B) A large aneroid is more likely to be correct than a small one.
     (3 7)   If  the aneroid has been previously        veri<U+FB01>ed, it is likely to give a
 better result.
    (4) After     being subjected to sudden changes of pressure the zero of an
 aneroid gradually changes, so that under such circumstances it ought only
 to be used as a differential and not as an absolute instrument, that is to
 say, used to determine the distance ascended, making it correct to begin
 with, or to ascertain the distance descended, making it correct to begin
 with, it being understood that the instrument ought to be quiescent for
 some time before the change of pressure is made.
    Before concluding I ought to mention that most of the experiments
 herein described were undertaken and executed in a very careful manner by
 Mr. T. W. Baker.

  taken by Her Majesty’s Government in 1840-1845 at the joint instance
 of the Royal Society and the British Association for the Advancement of
 Science.      The observations themselves, and their provisional discussion,
  have already been given in the previous numbers, V., VI., VIII., and X.

   the whole survey, and is accompanied by three maps, which have been
   prepared, with the permission of the Hydrographer, Captain Richards,
   R.N., F.R.S., under the careful superintendence of the Assistant Hydro
   grapher, Captain Frederick John Evans, R.N., F.R.S., one map being
   allotted to each of the three magnetic elements, viz. the Declination, In
   clination, and Intensity of the Magnetic Force.       In these maps the Isogo
   nic, Isoclinal, and Isodynamic lines have been drawn, by the author of the
   paper, conformably with the observations around the circumference of the
   globe between the parallel of 30° S. and the South Pole.          The paper also
   contains Tables, prepared with a view to the revision of the calculations of

   Gauss’s ‘ Allgemeine Theorie des Erdmagnetismus.’       They give the values of
   each of the three magnetic elements at the intersections of every <U+FB01>fth de
   gree of latitude between 40° of south latitude and the          South  Pole, and
   every tenth degree of longitude between 0 and 360°.
   “ On the Spectrum of Comet II., 1868.”                By WILLIAM Huooms,
           F.R.S. Received July 2, 1868.
                                       (Abstract.)
       The author describes the appearance of the comet in the telescope on
   June 22 to consist of a nearly circular coma, which became rather suddenly
   brighter towards the centre, where there was a nearly round spot of light.
   A tail was traced for nearly a degree.
       He found the light of the comet, when examined with a spectroscope,
    furnished with two prisms of 60°, to be resolved into three broad bright
   bands.
       The brightest band commences at about 6, and extends nearly to F.
   Another band begins at a distance beyond F, rather greater than half the
   interval between b and F.        The third band occurs about midway between
    D and E. In the two more refrangible of these bands the light was brightest
    at the less refrangible end, and gradually diminished towards the other
    limit of the bands.     The least refrangible of the three bands did not exhi
    bit  a similar gradation of brightness.
       These    bands could not be resolved into lines, nor was any light seen
    beyond the bands towards the violet and the red.
        The measures of these bands     are given, and a diagram of their appear
    ance.
        The author found this cometic spectrum to agree exactly with a form of
    the spectrum of carbon which he had observed and measured in 1864.
    When an induction spark, with Lcyden jars intercalated, is taken in a
    current ofole<U+FB01>ant gas, the highly heated vapour of carbon exhibits a spec
     trum which is somewhat modi<U+FB01>ed from that which may be regarded as
     typical of carbon.    The light is of the same refrangibilities, but the sepa
     rate strong lines are not to be distinguished.     The shading, composed of

 482     Mr. W. Huggins on the    Spectrum    of Comet  II., 1868.   [June 18,
 numerous <U+FB01>ne lines, which accompanies the lines appears as an unresolved
 nebulous light.
    On June    23  the spectrum of the comet was compared directly in the
 spectroscope with the spectrum of the induction spark taken in a current
 of ole<U+FB01>ant gas.
    The three bands of the comet appeared to coincide with the correspond
 ing bands of the spectrum of carbon.      In addition to an apparent identity
 of position, the bands in the two spectra. were very similar in their general
 characters and in their relative brightness.
    These observations were con<U+FB01>rmed on June 25.
    The remarkably close resemblance of the spectrum of the comet with
 that of the spectrum of carbon, necessarily suggests the identity of the sub
 stances by which in both cases the light was emitted.
    The great <U+FB01>xity of carbon seems, indeed, to raise some dif<U+FB01>culty in the
 way of accepting the apparently obvious inference from these prismatic
 observations.    Some comets have approached su<U+FB01>iciently near the sun to
 acquire a temperature   high enough to convert even carbon into vapour.
    In the case of other comets, the author suggests that the difficulty is one
 of degree only, for the conditions are not known under which even a gas
 permanent at the temperature of the earth could maintain su<U+FB02>icient heat
 to emit light.
    The author states that some phosphorescent substances give spectra
which are discontinuous, but he gives reasons which would scarcely permit
us to consider cometary light to be of a phosphorescent character.
    The spectrum shows that the colour of this comet was bluish green.
Considerable difference of colour has been remarked in the parts of some
comets.     Sir William Herschel described the head of the comet of 1811
to be of a greenish or bluish-green colour, while the central point appeared
of a ruddy tint. The same colours have been observed in other comets.
If carbon be the substance of some comets, this substance, if incandescent
in the solid state, or re<U+FB02>ecting, when in a condition of minute division, the
light of the sun, would afford a light which, in comparison with that emitted
by the luminous vapour of carbon, would appear yellowish or approaching
to red.
    The author refers to the bearing of     these results on certain  cometary
phenomena, and on the apparent identity of the orbits         of the periodical
meteors with those of some comets.

mens affecting l3 muscles proper to the head and neck, and 40 others
affecting 6 muscles which, acting upon the clavicle or scapula, are num
bered with the muscles of the upper extremity, viz. the cleido-occipital,
sterno-cleido-mastoid,        omohyoid,   trapezius,  levator   anguli   scapulaa,   and
levator claviculee.
    l.  C'lez'do-occipital (Cephalo-humeral      of the lower animals).—Of this
muscle 8 specimens have been found in the male subjects, all on both
sides—and 6 in the females, two of which were on the left side only.                  On
the left side of No. 3, male, and on both sides of No. 7, male, the curious
and interesting arrangement was found which is drawn from the former
subject in <U+FB01>g. 1.        A slip of parallel muscular <U+FB01>bres, three-fourths          of an
inch wide (a), arising from the sternal

end of the clavicle, close outside of
and    in   connexion      with the eternal
origin of the sterno-mastoid,        crossed
super<U+FB01>cially and obliquely the cleido
mastoid (b) (which was split into
two parts) to join the cleido-occipi
 ta! (0) about its middle.         The more
 usual    clavicular    attachment    of the
latter muscle was broad, and connected
 with the centre of the clavicle directly
 over the posterior triangle, reaching
 from the origin of the cleido-mastoid
 as far out as the clavicular attachment
 of the trapezius (d).         This arrange
 ment gives a very complex appearance
 to the whole group of muscles, and
 strikingly resembles the formation in
 the Marmot, Polecat, Genette, and
 striped Hyaena, and, to a less extent,
 in the Coati.     In these animals the ee
 phalo-humeral       is only connected with
 the trapezius      close up to the oceiput.         Towards the clavicle it is con
 tinued    forward, super<U+FB01>cial to the cleido-mastoid, and joins wholly or by
 a separate slip with the sterno-mastoid (see Cuvier and Laurillard’s plates).
 This resemblance to the cephalo-Itumeral of these animals tends strongly to
 con<U+FB01>rm the view of the homology of the cleido-occipital in Man, given by
                                       '
 the author in former papers.            On the right side of the subject No. 3,
 the cleidc-occipital was large, but presented no slip of connexion with the
 sterno-mastoid;       but it was found on both sides of No. 7.         A tendency to
 this formation was seen also in subject No. 21 of last year’s Table.
    In No. 13 the cleido-occipital was double, and distinct from both the
 cleido-mastoid and trapezius along its whole length.             This homologue of
 the cephan-ltumeral‘pf animals was found            distinct  and very well marked

by   Murie in his dissection of a Bushwoman (Journal of Anatomy and
Physiology, No. 2, May 1867, p. 198).
  2. Sterne-cleido-masloid.—In 4 male and 3 female subjects out of the
36, the clavicular origin of this muscle was double, or divided into two
portions.  In all but one of these the cleido-occipital was also present.
    3. Omohyoid.—In 2 male and 2 female subjects the posterior belly
presented an additional or clavicular origin.   Three were found on the
left side only, and one on the right only.    On the opposite side of one
male (No. 15), a muscular slip arising from the middle of the clavicle
(quasi-clavicular origin of the omohyoid) passed upwards and inwards to
join the demo-thyroid at its insertion, the omohyoid itself on that side
being normal, with the exception of having no median tendon.   In No. 9
the omohyoid, otherwise normal, passed through an opening between the
normal origin of the xterm-thyroid and an abnormal slip to that muscle
from the clavicle, at the junction of its middle and outer thirds. In No. 13
also, the median tendon of the omohyoid was wanting, a continuity of
muscular <U+FB01>bre passing from its origin to its insertion.  This is always the
case in Monkeys and the lower mammalia.       In a male subject (No. 2) the
anterior belly was double, the superior one fusing with the hyogloseus and
middle constrictor muscles, and receiving, moreover, a slip from the middle
of the sterno-t/iyroid (see fig. 2 It).
   Out of 70 subjects now examined by the author with a view to the abnor
malities of the omohyoid muscle, viz. 40 males and 30 females, the anterior
belly has been found double in 4 males, in two on both sides, and in two on the
right side only. In one male it was triple on both sides. A clavicular origin
of the posterior belly has been found in 2 males on the left side only; and in
3 females, of which 1 was on both sides, 1 on the right, and l on the left side
only. The median tendon has been found absent in 2 males, in l on the right,
and in the other on the left side only.    Thus in 12 out of 70 subjects some
irregularity existed in this muscle—a proportion greater than that found
by Professor Turner in 373 subjects, viz. 5 or 6 per cent. (Irregularities
of the Omohyoid, p. 2). A clavicular origin of the posterior belly was
found in 5 subjects out of the 70, or about 7 per cent.        Turner found it
in 17 out of 373 subjects,      e. rather more than
                                 1'.                   per cent.

70 subjects (also about     per cent.) the anterior belly was found double or
                            7
triple. Turner does not mention this abnormality, but found the anterior
belly blended with the sterno-hyoid in      out of the 373 cases.

     In   subjects examined by the author, the anterior belly of this
           102

supernumerary             decussated with its fellow across the median line.

Out of      34
            females   it was found double once only on the left side.
   In the Norway Rat (Zilus decumanus), the anterior bellies of the di
gastric are completely blended together, arising without any median <U+FB01>ssure
from an arched tendinous structure connecting the two median tendons.
They are also united in the Cercopithecus sabaeus, according to Rudolphi
(Heusinger's Zeitschrift, Bd. iii. S. 335), and blended so as completely to
cover the mylo-hyoids in Callilhriu: and Papio IIIormon (Cuvier and Lauril
lard’s plates).    More or less so they are found in the. ruminants.
   In the male subject No. 2, a combination of curious varieties led to
the sketch of the adjoining <U+FB01>gure (<U+FB01>g. 2), taken by the author from the
dissected parts.        The posterior
belly  of the  digastric (a) appeared             Fig. 2 (Subject No- 2)

different from the myla-glossus described in his last paper.  It also differs

superior constrictor which is attached to the side of the tongue, and
which was at <U+FB01>rst called by Winslow the “ mylo-glossus” (Comp. Myo
graph. Spec. p. 93).        For the sake of distinction the author has given
the name of genio-gloesus to this remarkable slip.
    On the same side of the subject was the bifurcation of the anterior belly
 of the omohyoid before mentioned (h), and also of the xterm-thyroid
 A considerable portion of the posterior <U+FB01>bres of each of these muscles was
 split off ; and the two slips, uniting together, were partly inserted into the
 tip of the greater horn of the hyoid bone, but chie<U+FB02>y blended with the
 <U+FB01>bres of the hya-glossus (k) and middle constrictor (l) muscles.
    5. Tl-opezius.-—1n 2 males the <U+FB01>bres of this muscle reached only so far
 down the back as the eighth and ninth dorsal spines respectively.            (This
 de<U+FB01>ciency has been found by the author in 4 males out of 70 subjects, viz.
 40 males and 30 females.)       in one (N o. 1 l) the cervical and dorsal portions
were completely separate and distinct muscles, one connected with the
 occipital bone and ligamentum nuc/ue, and the other with the dorsal spinous
 processes,—the     two joining only at their insertion into the acromion pro
 cess.    Something like this is the normal condition in the Mole, Omit/io
 rlzyncllus, and Echidna, and to a less marked extent in the Agouti, according
 to Meckel (Anat. Comp.) and Mivart and Murie (Proceedings of the Zoolo
 gical Society,   June 26,     1866).    It  has   been  recorded   in the human
 subject by Stemmerring (De Corp. Hum. Fabrica, t. iii. 1796), Fleischmann,
 Zagorsky, and Theile.       Macalister has also found it (“ Notes on Anomalies
 in Human Anatomy,” in Proc. Royal Irish Academy, April 23rd, 1866,
 p. 21).
    In the female    (No.31)   the cervical border of the trapezius was attached
 to the clavicle   as far inwards   as the origin of the sterno-cleido-mastoid,
and so covering the posterior triangle entirely.          A foramen or tendinous
arch, placed about the middle of the clavicle, allowed the passage of the
supraclavicular     nerves.   This very peculiar formation has been described
by Macwhinnie (London Med. Gazette, N0. 948, January 30th, 1846,
p. 194), and more recently <U+FB01>gured by Gruber, of St. Petersburg (Vier
Abbandlung. 1847, S. 16, 17). by Hallett (Edin. Med. and Surg. Journal,
 1848, N0. 174), and by Macalister.         The author believes it to be a blend
ing or fusion of the cleido-occipital or cepholo-liumeral with the cervical
border of the trapeziua, of the same kind as the more common blending
of the same muscle with the hinder border of the sterno-cleido-masfoid.
    This view is further supported by the arrangement found in another
female (No. 35), on the right side of whom the trapezius detached from
the upper part of its cervical border a considerable muscular slip to be
inserted    into the clavicle, close to the clcido-mastoid.       Through a ten
dinous    arch or opening left between this slip and the lower part of the
normal clavicular <U+FB01>bres of the trapezius the hinder belly of the omohyoid
passed, along with the supraclavicular        nerves, as before alluded to with

488           Mr.  J.  Wood on Variations in Human Myoloyy.           [June 18,
the abnormalities of that muscle.       On this side of the subject no proper
cleido-occipital was found; but on the other (left) side, this muscle was
large, well formed, and separate, both from the trapezius and steruo-cleido
mastoid.
     6. Levator anguli scapuhe.-—The variations of this muscle have been
this year recorded with a view to throw light upon the occasional occur
rence in the human subject of the levator claviculw described by the
author in former papers.
     In 2 males (Nos. 2 & 6) and ‘2 females (Nos. 20 & ‘29) this muscle was
much divided, forming a distinctly double muscle, one from the two upper,
and the other       from the third and fourth cervical transverse processes.
Such an arrangement is <U+FB01>gured by Cuvier and Laurillard in their plate 7
of the Anatomy of a Negro.        The upper one is there marked as the repre

     A  more perfect homologue of this muscle in the human subject, how
ever, has been recorded by Macwhinnie (op. cit. p. 194), and by the
author in his former papers—arising        from the transverse process of the
atlas, and, in some, as low down as that of the third cervical vertebra, and
inserted into the middle or outer third of the clavicle.
     Such a muscle has been noted and described by the author in 5 male
subjects out of 174 of both sexes in whom it has been carefully looked for.
Macalister has also found it in a spare female (0p.               In No. 5 of the
subjects noted in column 8 of the Table of the present year, a considera
ble and long muscular slip, arising by a tendon from the transverse process
of the third cervical vertebra, was found lying super<U+FB01>cial to the <U+FB01>bres of
the levator anguli scapulae, and inserted into the fascia placed immediately
behind the clavicle and covering the axillary surface of the <U+FB01>rst digitation
of the serratus magnus muscle.         A muscle similar to this was found by
Dr. Murie in the Bushwoman (op. cit.), and was rightly looked upon by
him as an imperfect levator claviculw, the insertion of which had only just
failed to reach the clavicle.    Kelch records that he saw, in afemale subject,
a triple division of the levator anguli scapulae, the middle part sending off a
slip to the scapulo-thoracic fascia (Beitriige zur pathologischen Anatomic,
  1813, xxv. S. 33).     Rosenmiiller found a slip from the <U+FB01>rst cervical trans
 verse process, inserted into the <U+FB01>rst digitation of the serratus magnus (De
 nonnullis Muse. &c. Leipzig, 1814, S. 5).         These were, no doubt, speci
 mens of the last-mentioned variety.         In the male subject (No. 6) the
 levator anguli scapula: was divided into six slips along its whole length,
 arising from the <U+FB01>ve upper cervical transverse processes, and all inserted
 into the usual place.
     On the left side of a female (No. 20), the subject of <U+FB01>g. 3, a less exten
   ive division of its <U+FB01>bres was found, combined with a double insertion, and
 a signi<U+FB01>cant   fusion of the lower portion with the serratus magnus and the
 r/lomboideus minor. This arrangement supports and illustrates the homology
 <U+FB01>rst pointed out by Meekel (Archiv, viii. S. 585, and Mnskellehrc, Bd. ii. S.

  402) between the levator anguli scapulee of the human subject and the uPper
  or cervical part of the serratus magnus as found in the lower animals—an
  homology which was disputed by no less               Fig. 3 (Subject No.
  an authority than Cuvier.       The muscle
 arose by <U+FB01>ve digitations from the hinder
  tubercles of the <U+FB01>ve upper cervical trans
 verse processes, and by a sixth from the
  <U+FB01>bres and fascia of the transversus colli
 muscle.     Those from the three upper
 and part of the fourth digitations (a) are
 inserted into the usual place at the su
 perior angle of the scapula.         The two
 and a half lower digitations     are  inserted
 as a separate muscle (6) into the verte
 bral border of the scapula as low down
 as   the spine, and are intimately con
 nected by their deeper surface with the
 <U+FB01>bres of insertion of the serratua mag
 nus.    A   muscular    slip from its lower
 border is attached      at its origin to the
 transversalis  colli, and through it to the
 upper cervical transverse processes; at
 its insertion it is blended with that of the
 rhomboideus minor             The lower por
 tion of the muscle may be considered as
 representing the <U+FB01>rst and second stages of that differentiation and transfer
 of insertion of some of the <U+FB01>bres of the levator anguli to the spine of the
 scapula which, in the omo-tracllélien or omo-atlanticus of animals, attains to
 the acromion process, and in the levator claviculaz of the Quadrumana and
 Man reaches, on the same line of departure, to the clavicle.           Macwhiunie
records a slip of the levator anguli inserted into the spine of the scapula
 (op. cit. p. 194), a little further advance in the same direction, in the
human subject.
    In two other male subjects (Nos. 9 & 10), also, the levator anguli scapulae
was connected by muscular slips with the hinder surface and upper <U+FB01>bres
of the serratus magnus.        In No. 10 it also received a slip from the scalenus
medias, and in the female (No. 29) from the sealenus posticus of one
side, and the serratus posticus superior on the other.           In No. 34 it gave
an interdigitating slip to the splem'ue capitis high up in the neck.
    7. Rhombo-utloid.—-In 3 male and 2 female subjects was found a
distinct muscle arising with the <U+FB01>bres of the splenius colli from the trans
verse process of the atlas, usually about half an inch wide, and forming a
muscular band which was placed super<U+FB01>cial to the serratus posticus supe
rior, and behind the rhomboideus minor, and inserted either into the upper
<U+FB01>bres of the tendon of origin of the rhomboideus major or into the verte

bral aponeurosis of the serratus posticus superior. In 1 male and the 2
females it was present on the left side only.          One of them was subject 20
 (given in <U+FB01>g. 3), where the abnormal muscle (e) is seen to pass under the
rhomboideus minor (d), to be inserted into the serratus tendon (f) under
the rhomboideus major (57), which is divided in order to show it.                 In
subjects 2, 3, and 23 its insertion was entirely into the serratus aponeurosis.
In Nos.     7 & 20 it was also connected with the spine of the seventh cer
 vical vertebra.     It has been described by Mr. Macalister as the Mambo
                                          a). In Haller’s
                                                             ‘

 tomicarum Selectiorum,’ vol. vi. (1733) p. 589, this muscle is described by
 F. Walther under the name of the “lifusculua singularis aplem'i accesso
 rius," or “Adjutor splenii.”
    8. Sundries.—In       subject 3 the demo-thyroid was double—the abnormal
 part arising from the <U+FB01>rst rib-cartilage and costo-clavicular ligament, and
joining the normal origin halfway up the neck. This abnormal slip bore
much     resemblance     at its origin to the costa-<U+FB02>zsdalis described by the
 author in his former      papers, differing only in its upper termination in the
 <U+FB01>bres of the sterno-thyroid, instead of the cervical fascia.          The origin of
 the sterno-hyoid was placed between the two heads.                In No. 4 was a
muscular slip arising tendinons with the anterior scalenus, and inserted
 <U+FB02>eshy with the medius.        In the male (No. 7) and the female (No. 33) well
 marked specimens of the “musculus glandular thyroideze”             of Smmmerring
were found.       The microscope proved satisfactorily that the structure of
the formation     was really muscular, and not median processes of the thyroid
gland, as sometimes is the case.          The slips appeared to be offsets from the
inner <U+FB01>bres of the thyro-hyoid muscle, which had become attached to the
gland-capsule.       In the female (No. 26) the thyro-kyoid was divided into
two distinct muscles, the inner one being the smaller, showing a tendency
to the formation of the levator thyroideaa.             In No. 9 the right sterno
 thyroid   was joined by    a clavicular   slip, round which the tendon of the emo
hyoid, as before described, played as through a pulley ; on the other side the
same muscle received aslip from the sterno-ltyoid.         The two sterno-thyroids
also decussated across the median line by a considerable portion of their inner
<U+FB01>bres.     This arrangement is found in the Squirrel and some other Rodents.
In No.    8 was a cephalo-p/taryngeus         muscle having the somewhat unusual
origin from the spine of the sphenoid and spheno-maxillary ligament.              At
its insertion it blended with the lower <U+FB01>bres of the middle constrictor.
    In the male (No. 11) and the female (No. 19) were found examples of the
slernalis brutorum muscle.          In both it was present on the right side only,
and well developed.         In the male it arose tendinons from the tendon of
the sterno-mastoid, from the manubrium sterni 1% inch below its upper
border, and from the fascia covering the pectoralis major muscle 2 inches
below the clavicle.       Its whole length was 3% inches, and it ended below
in  a <U+FB02>eshy radiating     way upon the fascia covering the sheath of the rectus
and external     oblique.    In the female it arose tendinons from the manu

                                                                       ____.__________-——

hrium sterni opposite the second rib, and had no connexion with the sterno
mastoid.      It formed a slender muscular belly, % inches long by % of an
inch wide, and ended upon the sheath of the rectus opposite the sixth rib
cartilage.
   This muscle      has been found        by the author in 7 out of 175 subjects,
in which     it has   been   carefully   looked   for.   This is 4 per cent.       Five
of the instances were in males, and 2 in females.              In the   males   it  was
found, in l on both sides, in 3 on the right side, and in l on the left side
only.     In the females it was found in both instances on the right side only.
   Professor Turner <U+FB01>xes the frequency of its occurrence, from observations
upon 650 subjects, at about 3 per cent.              He found it 9 times on both
sides, 5 times on the right, and twice on the left side only; while in 5
more it was single, and crossed the median line (Journ. of Anat. and Phys.
No. 2. May 1867, pp. 247, 248).             Professor W. Gruber found it in 5 out
of  95 subjects, in 3 on both sides, once on the right, and once on the left
side only (Mem. de l’Acad. Imp. de St. Pétersbourg, L. iii. 1860).
   Thirty-two columns of the Table are occupied by the remaining muscles
of the Arm. This is six more than those of last year; the additional lines
of variation      being made up by the sterno-scapular,             anconeus epitro
chlearis, extensor carpi intermedius, ext. pollicis et indicis, and ext. medii
digiti (which have been found so frequently as to require separation from
the muscles with which they are most closely connected), and the pronator
radii teres.
   9. Pectoralis major.—In the male (No. 2) and the female (N0. 25) a
detached outlying slip was found on both sides at the lower border of this
muscle, arising from the epigastric              aponeurosis covering the rectus
muscle, and inserted, separately from the rest of the pectoralis muscular
<U+FB01>bres, upon the deep surface of the upper <U+FB01>bres of the tendon of insertion.
In  the male the slip was small on one side, and arose opposite to the sixth
rib-cartilage   ; but on the other side large, and reaching as low as the seventh
rib.   The author looks upon the above abnormality as the homologue of
                            ” of Cuvier and Laurillard’s
the “portion ventrale                                         plates, constituting, in
most Mammalia, a large and separate portion of the pectoral group of
muscles.      It is also homologous with the “coda-humeral" of Professor
Huxley, and the clzondro-epitrochlear of Duvernoy.                Meckel describes it
as remarkably      distinct   in the Bats, drawing      the wings powerfully      down
and inwards      (Anat. Comp. vol. vi. p. 206). Zenker describes it as the
“braclzio-abdominal” muscle in the Batrachian reptiles, in whom it is
frequently continuous          with   the   rectus   abdominis   (Batrachomyologia.
Jenas, 1826, p. 39).
   In  the male    (No. [3)     was developed, on the left side only, a very large
and well-marked       example of the muscle described by the author as the
“clwndro-coracoid.”         It is placed in the Table among the sundries. It
consisted of a separate muscle arising by two digitations, the upper from
the sixth rib, and the lower from the epigastric aponeurosis covering the

  rectus, and formed     a muscle 2 inches wide, while passing upwards and
  outwards   across the axillary space, below and quite distinct from the
  pectorals, to be inserted by a broad tendinons expansion into the fascia
  covering the origin of the coraco-braelzialis muscle as high up as the coracoid
  process.   The pectoralis minor muscle was also very large and divided,
  and altogether the arrangement of these muscles resembled much that
 found in the Felidw and Rodents.           The chandro-coracoid portion forms,
 in the Norway Rat and Rabbit,         a separate element distinct from the other
 pectorals.    It seems   to be an upward transition of the insertion of the
 epigastric slip above described, with which it coincides closely at its origin.
  In animals it is considered by some writers a part of the panniculus
 camoaus.
    In 4 male subjects the clavicular <U+FB01>bres of' the peetoralis major were
 fused with those of the deltoid, leaving only a small opening below for
 the cephalic vein.      This arrangement has been recorded by Otto as an
 absence of the clavicular <U+FB01>bres of the deltoid, and by Seiler as an origin
 of the deltoid from the whole of the clavicle (Observ. Anat. 1808, fasc. i.).
 It indicates that kind of blending of the clavicular elevators of the upper
 arm which reaches its highest form in the lower portion of the cephalo
 humeral muscle of the Carnivore. and Rodents.
    In the female (No. 20) the clavicular <U+FB01>bres of the pectoralis were split
 into two distinct muscles, one occupying the sternal, and the other the
middle third of the bone. They were united at their insertion only.
    10. Pectoralis minor.—In no less than 8 subjects, 4 male and 4 female,
in 7 on both sides, and in     1 (male)
 on the left side only, a portion of                 Fig 4 (Subject No_ 10).
the tendon of this muscle, usually
 the   upper    part, was prolonged
over a pulley-like groove upon the
coracoid process, and pierced the
coraco-acromial ligament to be con
nected with the tendon of the su
praspinatus muscle, and implanted
with it into the capsular ligament
of' the shoulder-joint.    In  2 ol' the
males (Nos. 10 & 12) the tendon
was also connected with the upper
<U+FB01>bres of the glenoid ligament at its
point of union with the capsular.
In No. 10 the pectoralis minor was
arranged in the complex manner
shown in <U+FB01>g. 4.         The <U+FB01>bres of
the upper digitation (a), arising
from the second rib and intercostal
fascia, were joined to a roundish

of the glenoid (g).    The  middle   <U+FB01>bres  (b), arising from  the third and
fourth  ribs and fascia, were attached by    shorter tendon to the inner
                                                     a

coracoid muscles.   The lower <U+FB01>bres      d), arising from the <U+FB01>fth rib and

the adjacent intercostal and epigastric aponeuroses below the border of the
pectoralis major muscle (with which they were partly blended), divided
soon into two parts, of which the upper      was inserted into the fascia of
the coracoid        muscles (cut off short in the woodcut) while the lower (d)

were united         in   tendon which passed over these muscles, pierced the
                         a
 capsular ligament above the subscapularis (divided in the out), and <U+FB01>nally
joined with the uppermost tendon to be inserted into the upper part of
the glenoid ligament.       bursal opening existed at this point between the
                                 A
joint and the subscapular bursa.      In the adjoining <U+FB01>gure the pectoralis
 major, part of the deltoid, the coracoid muscles, and the subscapularis are
partly removed, and the shoulder-joint opened to show the glenoid ligament.
  In this curious instance the lower part of the muscular arrangement                     is
             “ chomlro-coracoid             ”
                                     muscle joined up to the pectoralis minor
evidently      a
at two separate points,    viz. at its origin and insertion.  At its origin               it
coincides with the usual origin of this muscle, reaching down nearly as far
as the latissimus dorsi; while at its insertion         fused with the glenoid
                                                         it    is
tendon of the pectoralis minor.  Its course over the origins of the coracoid
muscles quite coincides with frequent insertion of the “ chondro-coracoid.”
                                        a
It   resembles considerably  the intermediate pectoral of the lower animals.
     This remarkable insertion into the glenoid ligament goes far to corrobo
rate the views expressed           by
                          Macalister (Journal of Aunt. and Phys. N0. 2.
May 1867, p. 317) upon the homology of his cornea-glenoid ligament with
the humeral tendon of the pectornlis minor.
   In another male subject (No. 13) the upper <U+FB01>bres of the lesser pectoral
passed over the coracoid process to be inserted into the coraco-acromial
ligament.          In
                 female (No. 32) the upper <U+FB01>bres of the muscle on the
                        a
right side     were inserted
                        by   <U+FB02>at aponeurotic tendon, half an inch wide,

of the coracoid process, and inserted into the clavicle with the outermost
<U+FB01>bres of the subclaviaa muscle.        It has been named by the author the
Scapulo-clavicular muscle,    as it seems  clearly to be the homologue of the
muscle described and <U+FB01>gured by Cuvier and Laurillard, under the name of
the “ scapula-clavien,” in the Rat-mole of the Cape, and the Didelphys mar
supialis or Sarigue (plates 216 & 195). The author has found the muscle
also well marked, separate, and distinct in the Norway Rat (Mus decu
manus), as well as in the Guineapig, and in a less distinct form in the
Rabbit.     The muscle is noted in the Table, in column 40, among the single
specimens.
    12. Latissimua dorsi.——In the male (No. 9) was a detached slip from
the ninth intercostal fascia of the right side, which joined this muscle high
up near its insertion.     In the female (No. 29) was a musculo-teudinous
slip, passing from the left latissimus across the axillary vessels, and inserted
into the fascia covering the. biceps muscle.       It seemed    to  be a formation
                                        ” and
between the ordinary “ Achaelbogen             a  dorso-epitroclilear   muscle. A
similar slip, reaching only to the fascia covering the coraco-brachialis, was
present on both sides in N 0. 32.
    Out of 102 subjects, viz. 68 males and 34 females, :1 dorso-epitrochlear
slip of muscular <U+FB01>bres has been found by the author in 5 ; 3 of which were
males, and 2 females.     In 2 of the males the slip was lost on or joined the
scapular head of the triceps muscle.       In the third male it was lost on the
fascia covering the coraco-brachialis.     All these were found in both arms.
Of the 2 females, one was found on both sides, and ended on the fascia
covering the coraco-brachialia,     and the other on the left side only, and
ended in the fascia covering the short head of the biceps.         In 6 of the 102
subjects the latissimus gave 05 a considerable slip to the insertion of the
pcctoralis major (Achselbogen); 3 were in males, 2 on both sides, and l
on the left side only; and 3 in females, 2 on both sides, and         l on the left
only. In 3 subjects the upper costal <U+FB01>bres of the latissimus were con
nected with a broad muscular slip arising with them, which, after crossing
the axilla upwards and outwards, were inserted with the pectorah's minor
into the coracoid process, or into the fascia of the coracoid muscles just
below it (cliondro-coracoid). Two of these were in males, one on the right
side only (a similar slip on the left side joined the pectoralis major), and
the other on the left only.      The third was found in a female subject on
the left side only.
    13.  Curaco-brachialz's.—Iu 2 males (Nos. 1 & 10) and 3 females
(Nos.   21,  23, & 24) this muscle presented an entirely double formation.
The upper slip was inserted into the usual place ; the lower passed down
further, to be connected with the internal brachial ligament or intermus

cular    septum as far down as the ridge of the internal             condyle.     The
musculo-cutaneous nerve usually passed between the two.              The lower slip
has been described by the author as a separate element, the coraco
braclzialis longus (Journal of Aunt. and Phys. No. l. p. 49).          This form of
coraco-brachialis     is found in the Ornithorhynchus, Echidna, and some
 Rodents.     In  the female   (No. 30) this long muscle existed in the form of
 a distinct bundle given off from the middle of the coraco-brachialis,            and
ending in a long tendon which was implanted fairly upon the inner condyle,
and which seemed to originate in a differentiation of the internal brachial
ligament.      In the female (No. 23) was found a good specimen of the muscle
 named by the author in the same paper the “ coraco-braclzialis brevis,” or
 “ rotator Itumeri.”      It arose separately from the under surface of the cora—
 coid process near its base, and was inserted into the neck of the humerus,
just below the lesser tuberosity and above the latissimus dorsi.          It is found
 usually in the   Quadrumana,     coexistent with the longer form, and in the
 Rodents and Carnivora singly.
    In the male (No. 9) a large coraco-brachialis gave of? a considerable
bundle of muscular <U+FB01>bres, which joined bodily those of the brachialia an
 ticus.    This has been before found by the author, and also by Macwhinnie
 (op. cit.) and Hyrtl (Lehrbuch, S. 863).        It is signi<U+FB01>cant as the homologue
 of the semimembranosus in the lower extremity, supplying the homologous
origin from the coracoid (isehium)        as the brachialis   supplies the homolo
gous insertion.
    14. Biceps brackii.—ln       2 males and 6 females, out    of the 36 dissected
this session and given in the Table, this muscle was provided with a third
or humeral head.        In the left arm of No. 14 a slip of muscular <U+FB01>bres was
given off from the lower third of the coraco-brachialis, and joined the
short head about its middle. This seems to be merely a doubled or divided
short head, of which the lower portion separates from the coraco-brachialis,
lower down than usual, as we frequently <U+FB01>nd in the Quadrumana.                In both
arms of No. 17 the muscular slip, half an inch wide, was given o<U+FB02>' from the
humerus just at the insertion of the coraco-brachialis.          In the 6 other in
stances the third head arose, in the most usual place, with the upper <U+FB01>bres
of the brachialis anticus, and joined the tendon at the same point as the two
normal heads.       In 1 (No. 24) it was found on both sides, in 4 on the left
side only, and in l on the right side only.
    Out of 175 subjects examined by the author, a third or humeral head of
the biceps was found in 14, viz. in 7 males and 7 females.              In 4 others,
viz. 3 males and 1 female, it was found coexistent with a fourth head,
also arising from the humerus.        In 3 of these the fourth head arose from
one of the tuberosities or the borders of the bicipital groove ; and in the
fourth, from the outside of the humerus, between the insertion of the deltoid
and the origin of the supinator longus.        This gives a proportion of about 1
in 9 out of the 175 subjects, agreeing nearly with the computation of Theile,
viz. l in 8 or 9, and not with that of Hallett, viz. l in 15.

4-96          Mr.  J. \Vood   on Variations in Human Myology.             [June 18,
    In the right arm of the male (No. 10) (noted in column 15 in the Table)
was found a brachio-raa'ialis      as a detached muscle (<U+FB01>g. 5, a) of considerable
size, arising separately from the upper part of the outer condyloid ridge of
the humerus and intermuscular septum, just below the
deltoid        and above the supiuator longus             Passing        Fig. 5
         (11)                                       (c).           (Subject N0. 10).
as   a <U+FB02>at    muscular   band downwards,       forwards,  and in
wards, outside      the biceps (b), it was inserted by a <U+FB02>at
aponeurotic     tendon into the oblique line of the radius,
close below the bicipital tuberosity', and between the in
sertions of the supinator brevis (e) and prouator radii
teres  (f).     Although quite detached from other muscles,
and inserted into the radius below the biceps, the homo
logical relation of this muscle, in the situation of its
origin from the humerus, to the fourth head of the bi—
ceps just alluded to (recorded in the author’s paper of
 1864), is clearly apparent; and it holds the same rela
tion to that external humeral head of the biceps as the
detached brachio—<U+FB01>zscialis,         described in the author’s
papers    of   1864,  1865,  and    1866,  does to the internal
humeral      head   of  the same     muscle.     Meckel, quoting
 Pietsch (Journal de      Roux,  t.  xxxi. p. 245), mentions an
instance    in which three humeral         slips,  one from    the \
outside of the humerus (homologous            with the foregoing
abnormality), one from the inner side (homologous with
the more common third head), and one from the short
or coracoid head of the biceps, joined together to form
one muscle, which was inserted into the radius by a
separate tendon, behind the normal one, upon the bid
 pital tuberosity (Muskellehre, S. 504).           He also quotes
 Rudolphi (in Blumenbach’s Med. Bibl. Bd. i. S. 176)
 and   Sels (Diss. Anat. Muse. Variet. sistens, 1815,
 p. 12) for an instance in which a muscular bundle of the
 size of a <U+FB01>nger passed from the outer head of the
 biceps to be inserted separately into the radius.            The
 more perfectly detached form of this abnormality is also alluded to by
 Theile (in Scemmerriug’s Encyclop. Anatomique, Jourdan’s Trans. 1843,
 p. 217), by R. Wagner (in Heusiuger’s Zeitschrift, Heft iii. Bd. iii. S. 345),
 and by Hyrtl (Lehrbuch).            A case very similar to the present has been
 described by W. Gruber (in Miiller’s Archiv, 1848, S. 428) as a variety of
 the brachialis anticus, in the right arm of a very muscular male, in whose
 left arm was found the more common form of the third head of the biceps.
 It arose from the humerus, close to the outer condyloid ridge, as a thick
 muscle, and was inserted by a separate tendon into the radial tuberosity
just below the biceps, giving        OR a slip of tendon to the apoueurosis of the
 forearm.

   15. Brachiulis anticue.—-In    both arms of the male (No. 6) some of the
<U+FB01>bres of this muscle were directly continuous     with those of the supinator
lonyus, an ape-like arrangement before noticed by the author in his paper
of 1866.    He has found it in 6 males on both sides out of 102 subjects.
It is recorded also by Macalister (op. cit. p. 19). Slips from this muscle
to the outer part of the fascia of the forearm have been mentioned by Seem
merring, Theile, Macwhinnie, and Hyrtl.        In the female (No. 22) the bra
chialis anticns was divided into two muscles, an outer and an inner,
both inserted   into  the coronoid   process.    This has been observed by
the older anatomists.      It resembles the arrangement in the Rabbit and
Agouti.
   16. Anconeus epitrachlearis.—In his paper read before the Royal Society
in June 1866, the author mentioned and tabulated a detached muscular slip
in the right elbow of a male subject, arising separately from the back part
of the inner condyle of the humerus, and passing across and super<U+FB01>cial to the
ulnarnerve, and distinct both from the triceps and <U+FB02>exorcarpi ulnaris muscles,
to be inserted into the inner side of the alecranon process of the ulna.
This muscle he again described and <U+FB01>gured in his paper of last year, com
paring it with a like muscle he had found in the Rabbit.       During the last
session this muscle has been found in 4 male subjects out of the 36—in 3
in both arms, and in l in the left arm only.     The author has also found the
muscle in his dissections of the Orang, Bonnet-Monkey, Mole, Hedgehog
common Weasel, Cat, Norway Rat, Squirrel, and Ornithorhynchus. In the
Mole it is particularly large and well developed, as are all the muscles of
the upper arm. It is also well marked in the Norway Rat and Rabbit. In
the subjects of the Table of the present year it has been very carefully
looked for, with a view to determine the frequency of its occurrence, and to
compare the results with those stated by Professor Gruber of St. Peters
                                       ‘ Mémoires de
burg, in a paper published in the                      l’Acad. des Sciences de
St. Pétersbourg,’ in June l866.      This eminent observer states that he has
found this muscle (epitrochleo-anconeua) as frequently as in 34 per cent. of
subjects—in 26 out of 79 males, and in 8 out of 21 females.        In 14 it was
on both sides, in 12 in the right, and in 3 in the left arm only.     It seems,
therefore, to be more commonly found in the Sclavonic than in the Anglo
Saxon races.    Professor   Gruber <U+FB01>gures and minutely describes this muscle,
both in the human subject and in many animals—in Imma nemestrinus,
Cebusfaluellus, Galeopitbecua, M yogale, Daayurus viverrinus, Arctic Bear,
Lion, Cat, Hare, 3-banded Armadillo, Seal, and many others. It seems to
correspond with the muscle described in the Hyrax by Mivart and Marie
as a fourth head of the triceps, and in the Rabbit by Krause as the anconeus
guartus.    It is <U+FB01>gured, but not distinguished from the other anconeal
muscles,  in Cuvier and Laurillard’s plates of the Panther, Genet, Beaver,
Marmot, Rat-mole, Great Anteater, Elephant, and many other animals
of various genera.
   l7. Pronator radii     term-In     2 males and ‘2 females this  muscle was

doubled or split along nearly its whole length into a condyloid and coronoid
muscle, the latter being inserted higher than, and external to, the former
part.   In No. l    the coronoid origin was a rounded tendon.            In   the female
(No. 35) the two parts were distinct throughout, and connected only by a
small slip at their insertion. In No. 31 the condyloid origin of the pro
nator was the only one present.      The occasional occurrence of a double
pronator has been noticed by Albinus, Saammerring, Theile, and Meckel.
Mr. Macalister has lately called attention to this formation as an evidence
of a second or accessory embryonic germ, represented by the coronoid
origin, and homologous with the tibial head of the soleus (Journal of
Anat. and Phys. Nov. 1867). The coronoid origin is not found in the lower
Mammalia,   and is present only in the higher Quadrumana.       It was found
by  the author large  and  well marked   in the Orang, arising by a strong,
broad tendon, common to          it,
                                the <U+FB02>exor carpi radialis, and the <U+FB02>exor sub

the same animal there was no tibial origin whatever to the soleus. The
coronoid head of the pronator was not found by the author in the Bonnet
Monkey.     Dr. Humphry found      in the Chimpanzee disposed as in the
                                       it
human subject.
  18. Flavor sublimis digitorum.-—In the left arm of          a   male   (No.      4)   was
an unusual fusiform muscular slip from the coronoid origin of this muscle,
ending in   long tendon which, passing under the annular ligament to the
            a
palm, gave origin to the outer half of  bipenniform
                                                 a                <U+FB01>rst    lumbn'calis
muscle.  The inner head of the lumbrical arose from                its usual       place.
This abnormality was described in the arm of negro   a       in  the author’s paper
 of 1865, the long tendon arising in that instance from the deep <U+FB01>bres of
 the sublimis, along with    a  coronoid “ accessoriue ad <U+FB02>ew. long. pollicis,”
and was joined in the lower part of the forearm by muscular slip from the
                                                         a
radius.    In No. the tendon to the middle digit was double. In Nos.
                    7                                                                    ll
and 17, males, and in 20, 30, 32, 34, and 36, females        (7in all), the origin of
 the <U+FB02>exor sublimis from the coronoid process was twofold, viz. :—one, <U+FB02>eshy,
from the upper part of the inner border of the process, and continuous with
the <U+FB01>bres of the condyloid and ligamentous origins; and             a   second, <U+FB02>at,
 tendinous, and riband-shaped, from the lower angle of the coronoid process—
 the latter joining the <U+FB01>bres of the radial origin before these united with the
rest.    In all but this arrangement was on both sides.

    In females (Nos. 19 and 22) the sublimis tendon to the little <U+FB01>nger
        2
was absent.      In the latter the perforated tendon was supplied by the fourth
lumbn'calis muscle.      This arrangement forms      a contrasted instance to that
just mentioned, in wl<U+FB01>ch the <U+FB01>rst lumbricalis took origin from               tendon
                                                                               a
supplied    by the sublimis.   In the left arm of the female (No. 20) musculo

tendinous slip was given off from the sublimis to the palmar fascia, in aid
of very feeble palmaris longus.

 ject (op. cit. S. 6).      In the opposite arm both the palmaris longus and the
 substitutory slip from the sublimis were wanting.           In the female (No. 23)
 a separate digastric muscular belly was provided for the perforatus tendon
 of the index, while the rest of the muscle was much divided.             In No. 31 a
 like digastric muscle gave gave off the perforatus tendons to both the index
 and little <U+FB01>ngers.       This was exactly like the instance described in the au
 thor’s last paper.       It has been recorded also by Meckel, and lately by
 Macalister.      It is occasionally found in the Quadrumana.
     19. Flexor profundus digitorum.—In no less than 4 males and 6 females
 out of the 36 subjects of the present year, and in 19 subjects out of a total
 of 102, was found the rounded, tapering, muscular slip arising with the
 condylo-coronoid origin of the sublimis, and joining, either by <U+FB02>eshy <U+FB01>bres
 or by a long tendon, some part of the <U+FB02>ezor profundus or its tendons.              It
 was observed by Gantzer, and named by him the “ aecessorius ad <U+FB02>exorem
 pro<U+FB01>mdum digitorum.”            In two males (Nos. 2 and 9) it joined that part
 of the profundus which supplied the index <U+FB01>nger.               In No. 9 it came off
 from the coronoid in common with a like slip to the <U+FB01>exor longus pollicis.
 In seven subjects it joined the second tendon of the profundus, viz. that to
 the middle digit; and in one female (No. 31) it was large, and ended in a
 long and good-sized tendon, dividing at the wrist into separate tendinons
 slips to the three inner digits, presenting almost the appearance of an in
 termediate common <U+FB01>exor, homologous with that which constitutes the
 chief bulk of the combined <U+FB02>exor muscles in the Carnivora and other Mam
 malia.     It was similar in many respects to the arrangement in the Negro
 before alluded to.        The author has found the slip of connexion between
 the coronoid <U+FB01>bres of the sublimis and the profundus in the arm of the
 Orang-outang.        It is slender, and joins that part of the profundus which be
 comes di<U+FB01>'erentiated into a <U+FB01>exor indicis in this animal, as well as in the
 Gorilla and Chimpanzee. The author has also found the same slip in the Ma
 cacus radiatus, arising musculo-tendinous          with the sublimis, and uniting
just   above  the   wrist  with  the  combined  tendons  of the <U+FB02>exor profundus and
longus    pollicis,  just before the tendinons slip to the thumb is given off.
 In Nycticebus tardigradus, or Slow Loris (in which animal the common
 <U+FB02>exors are still distinct as in Man and the higher Quadrumana), a slip of
 tendon from the sublimis unites with the profundus above the carpus, and
joins also the <U+FB02>exor pollicis (Mivart and Murie, Proc. Zool. Soc. Feb. 1865,
p. 24).      Meckel also describes this in the Loris.            It is also found in
 Clieiromys,    according to Owen, and in Tareius, as described by Burmeister,
showing in these animals         a more decided tendency to the more complete
amalgamation and         substitution   found in animals lower in the scale.   In the
Hedgehog the author has noted its presence in a more decided form, and
still more largely developed in the Guineapig, Surmulot, and Rabbit, where
it assumes more of the size and importance which it possesses in the Carni
vora, in whom it constitutes the chief bulk of the combined <U+FB01>exors.

form belly.       In the right arm of the same subject, a single penniform
muscle, arising from the middle third of the front surface of the radius be
low the <U+FB02>exor longus pollicis, gave off a tendon which passed under the
annular ligament behind that of the <U+FB01>exor longus pollicis, and ended by
giving origin to the outer half of a bipenniform<U+FB01>rat lumbricalis muscle; but
it   did not form any other kind of junction with the indicial tendon of the
profundus.      The last abnormality has been observed by Theile and Henle.
It has an evident relation to that on the left arm of the same subject, al
 though the slip does not quite reach the tendon of the profundus; and it
 has also a more remote one to the slip before described from the sublimis
 to the bipenniform <U+FB01>rst lumbricalis—the connexion between the two in the
 latter being kept up by the blending of a coronoid accessory muscle of the
profundus or <U+FB02>ezor pollicis longus with the slip to the lumbricalis. In one
 of last year’s subjects the tendon to the bipenniform lumbricalis came di
 rectly from the belly of the <U+FB02>exor longus pollicis, in place of having a
 distinct radial muscular belly.     In the male (No. 7) the profundus itself
 gave off a long musculo-tendinous      slip to the second lumbricalis.     In the
 female (No. 19) that portion of the <U+FB01>bres of the <U+FB01>exor profundus which
 arises from the interosseous ligament, and gives rise to the indicial tendon,
 formed a distinct <U+FB01>exor indicis, an areolar interval extending along its
 whole length and separating it from the rest of the <U+FB01>bres of the pro
 fundus.
      20. Flexor longus pollicis.—In 27 out of the 36 subjects, viz. 13 males
  and 14 females, this muscle received a <U+FB02>eshy, fusiform coronoid origin, the
  “ muscular   accessoriua”   of Gantzer.    Sometimes it was distinct   from the
  coronoid <U+FB01>bres of the sublimis, but was more frequently blended withlhem.
  In both arms of the male (N0. 5) the accessory muscle received an addi
  tional muscular slip from the condyloid <U+FB01>bres of the sublimis, the <U+FB01>bres of
  which were continuous with those of the tendon before described as passing
  to the <U+FB01>rst lumbricalis   muscle.   This coronoid or condyloid slip has been
  found by the author in 40 subjects out of 102, viz. in 22 out of 68 males,
  and in 18 out of 34 females.      It would thus seem to be more common in
  the latter sex.     In 13 of the males and 12 of the females it was present in
   both arms, in 4 males and 4 females in the right arm only, and in 5 males
  and 2 females in the left only.      The condyloid origin occasionally found
   forms a still closer homology with the chief or condyloid origin of the com
  bined <U+FB02>exors of the lower animals.       In 3 subjects, viz. 1 male (No. 13) in
   both arms, and 2 females (in No. 28 in the right arm, and in No. 32 in the
   left only), the <U+FB02>exor longus pollicis tendon subdivided into two, the inner
   and smaller joining in two of them the indicial tendon of the perforans
   about the wrist—but in one (No. 28) having a distinct insertion into the
   outer part of the base of the ungual phalanx of the index <U+FB01>nger, lying in

the sheath as a separate tendon.          The former of these arrangements has
been observed by the older anatomists,'Fleischmann,            Loschge, Gantzer, and
Meckel. Both represent very closely the tendinous connexion usually ex
isting between the long <U+FB02>exors of the toes as a slip from the <U+FB02>exor hallucis
to the second, third, and sometimes the fourth tendons of the <U+FB02>exor com
munis.      In his paper of 1866 (p. 235) the author described a variety in
which the communicating slip passed in the opposite direction, viz. from
the indicial tendon of the profundus to the <U+FB02>exor longus pollicis, an ar
rangement which is found in the Gorilla, according to Duvernoy, and in the
                                                                 J
Chimpanzee as described by Professor Wilder (Boston ourn. of Nat. Hist.
vii. 364).     This resembles an occasional variety in the communicating slip
between the homologous tendons in the foot of the human subject.
    21. Lumbricales manila—Besides the abnormal origin of the <U+FB01>rst lum'
bricalis before alluded to, there were 8 other irregularities affecting these
muscles in the 36 subjects.         In Nos. 5 and 10, male, and No. 36, female,
the second lumbricalis was bipenniform in its origin from the contiguous
sides of the <U+FB01>rst and second perforating tendons.           In the left arm of Nos. 4
and 18, and in both arms of No. 8, all males, the third lumbricalis             was bi
furcated, with a double insertion into the extensor aponeurosis of the third
and fourth digits.       This was the case also in the left arm of No. 7, while
in the right arm, both the third and fourth lumbricales were bifurcated and
inserted into the contiguous sides of their opposing digits.            In the left arm
of No. 18 the fourth lumbricalis was absent.            In the left arm of No. 17 a
 slip of communication was observed between the origin of the <U+FB01>rst palmar
interosseus and the middle of the <U+FB01>rst lumbricalis, which thereby assumed
 the appearance of a bipenniform muscle, an abnormality which does not ap
pear to have been before recorded.          All these subjects but one were males ;
 4 were found on both sides, 3 on the left only, and           l on the right only.
     Out of 102 subjects, viz. 68 males and 34 females, examined by the author,
 some of the lumbricales of the hand have been found abnormal in 19.                  In
 4 of these, abnormalities of two kinds occurred, making altogether 23 spe
 cimens ; 15 were males and 4 only females, giving a proportion of twice as
 frequent in the male sex.        8 were found on both sides, 8 on the right side
 only, and 7 on the left only.        The second was doubled in its insertion once
 only,  in the  left hand;    and  was  bipenniform in its origin in two instances.
 The third was bifurcated and double at its insertion in 10 instances, in 6 on
 both sides, 2 in the right, and 2 in the left hand only.          It was bipenniform
 in its origin in 2 subjects, in both hands.        The fourth was doubled in 2 in
 stances, 1 in the right and l in the left hand.           In one female it supplied,
 in  both  hands,  the  perforatus   tendon  of the  <U+FB01>fth digit. Once it was inserted
 into the ulnar side of the ring~digit instead of the little <U+FB01>nger, as has been
 observed by Moser and Theile; and in three instances it was totally want
 ing—once on the right and twice on the left side. The last abnormality
 has been recorded by Smmmerring and Meckel.                  The above <U+FB01>gures are
 considerably    smaller than those given by Froment        (Recherch.    sur plusieurs

points d'Anatomie, 1853), who found some of these muscles abnormal in
45 per cent. of subjects. The proportionate frequency of the several muscles
affected, however, is much the same.     He also found the third to be most
frequently affected, as had been observed indeed by the older anatomists,
Petsche, Walther, and Heister (in Heller’s Disput. Anatom. Select.),                     as
well as by Meckel and Theile.
   22. Flea-or carpi radialis.—In three males and two females, two of
the males on the right side and the rest 0n the left only, the tendon of
this muscle gave a slip of insertion into the trapezium before being im
planted upon the base of the second metacarpal bone.    This has been re
corded by Albinus, Loschge, F   leischmann, Theile, and Hyrtl, and is men
tioned by Henle (Muskellehre, S. 191).
   Flea'or carpi radialis brevis seu pro<U+FB01>ndus*.—Iu the left arm of a female
(N0. 28) was found        a small    specimen of the variety of abnormality de
scribed by the author under         this name. It arose from the oblique line of
the radius, under the origin of the <U+FB02>exor sublimis, by a falciform aponeurosis,
with a fusiform belly 1% inch long, and was inserted by a round tendon into
that deep process of the annular ligament which is implanted upon the
ridge of the trapezium and trapezoid, enclosing the groove for the tendon
of the <U+FB02>exor carpi radialis.  In the left arm of No. 32 (also a female) 11
large specimen of the same muscle existed, arising aponeurotic from the
oblique line and outer border of the radius, with a fusiform belly ending in
a round tendon which crossed deeply and obliquely across that of the <U+FB01>exor
longus pollicis, close upon the wrist-joint, to be inserted in a fan-shaped
way into the head of the 0s magnum, almost but not quite reaching to the
base of the middle metacarpal bone.    This specimen supplies aconnecting
link between the fusiform muscle attached to the annular ligament of
N0. 23 (which it resembled in its shape and origin) and the completel<U+FB02>exor
of the middle metacarpal bone described by the author in former papers,
which it closely resembles in its insertion.   In the same hand the <U+FB02>ezor
carpi radialis gave off a slip to the trapezium.    In both arms of No. 28
the palmarie longua was wanting ; but in No. 32 that muscle was present
   * While this is going through the press, the author has been favoured by Professor
W.   Gruber, of St. Pétersburg, with the last and several back numbers of the ‘ Bulletin do
l’Acad. Imp. des Sciences de St. Pétersbourg.’ In the last he claims priority of discovery
and publication in the matter of the above-named muscle, which he <U+FB01>gured and described
in three male subjects in 1859 (in tom.       no. 28, of that periodical), and which he then
named “ M. radio-carpeus”      and “ M. radIb-carpometacmpcus."         The author takes the
earliest opportunity of acknowledging this priority as regards himself. He was aware of,
and has frequently referred to evidences of Professor Gruber’s industry in observation,
but he did not recognize his exceeding merits as a discoverer till informed of them by
the pamphlets above mentioned.    In the last, Professor Gruber himself refers to the
                                  " M.               ”                   ‘
publication of an instance of the      radio-carpet“   by M. Fauo in the Bull. de la
Soc. Anat. de Paris,’ in November 1851, with which he himself did not become ac
quainted before 1859!!   The grounds upon which he claims priority in face of this are
not‘convincing;  but he objects to the name given by the author, and announces that
the muscle shall from henceforward be called “ M radialis inlcrmls Movie       (8.

    and normal     in the same arm, and fusiform in the opposite or right arm.
    In both the sex was female, and the muscle was found in the left arm
   only.    In   the 8 instances previously described by the author the sex in 7
   was male    ;  and in all, the muscle was found in the right arm only. The
   latter peculiarity was also present in 2 specimens, of which notes have been
   kindly forwarded by Mr. Macalister of Dublin, one of which was inserted
   into the third metacarpal and the other into the annular ligament.                 In
   a note sent to the author      in March last, the same excellent observer         fa~
   voured him with a description of a peculiar arrangement of the muscle which
   he had found in a female in the left arm only.          The muscle arose by two
   heads, viz. the more usual one from the radius between the <U+FB02>exor sublimis
  and <U+FB02>exor      longus pollicis, and the other, <U+FB02>at and aponeurotie, from the
  internal condyle of the humerus. These joined in amuscular belly 4 inches
  long, which lay deeper than that of the <U+FB02>exor carpi radialis, and outside
  of the <U+FB02>exor longus pollicis, and was inserted by three slips of tendon into
  the deep surface of the annular ligament.          The palmaric longus was also
  present, and normal in this case.
      23. Palmarz's longue.—In three males (Nos. 1, 6, & 15) this muscle and
  its tendon were both double, in the <U+FB01>rst two in the left arm only.                In
  the last it was found in the right arm only—the supernumerary muscle being
  almost median and fusiform in shape, and the tendon of insertion reaching
  only to the annular ligament.        In both arms of a male (No. 17) its tendon
  was split up into several parts, all inserted into the annular ligament closer
 than usual to the scaphoid.          In both arms of No. 16 its belly was fusi
 form and nearly median, and its tendon of insertion gave off a slip to the
 origin of the abductor pollicis.        In the left arm of the females (Nos. 31 &
 34) the muscular belly was also fusiform and median in its position.               In
 the latter, the tendon of insertion was double.          In four, all females, the
 palmaris was found entirely wanting—in No. 28 on both sides, in Nos.
 20 Sr 31 in the right arm only, and in No. 36 in the left only.              In the
 right hand of the last, the palmaris breuis was also absent.              No slip of
 substitution     was found in any of these instances.      In the right arm of the
 male (No. 13), and in the left of the female (No. 29), the only representa
 tive of this muscle was a feeble rudimentary tendinous slip.
     Out of 102 closely observed subjects, viz. 68 males and 34 females, 23
 have presented abnormalities of this muscle.            In 7 of these they have
varied in the two arms, presenting altogether 3l instances; 6 were double
muscles, and 3 double tendons; of these, in 7 males and 2 females, 1 was
in both arms,      2 in the  right, and no less than   6 in the left arm only.      It
has been altogether absent in 9 instances, and rudimentary in 2,viz. in 4 males
and 7 females; of these, 4 were in both arms, 4 in the right, and 3 in the
left arm only.       The number of absent muscles was thus nearly double in
half the total number of females, giving a proportion             of  4 to  l of  fre
quency of absence in this sex.         In 5, viz. 3 males and  2 females, the mus
cular belly was median or inverted, in 2 on both sides,         ‘2 in the right arm,

and     1 in the left only.    In 1 male and 1 female only was the <U+FB02>avor carpi
radialis brevis present when this muscle was absent or rudimentary.               In
the left arm of one female a substitutory slip came from the <U+FB02>ezor sublimic
digitorum.        In  3 males,  in  2 on both sides, and 1 on the left only, such a
slip was derived from the <U+FB02>exor carpi radialis.
      24. Extensor carpi radialis Jungian—In 2 males and           1 female, twice in
the right, and once in the left arm, this muscle was entirely blended at its
origin with its twin muscle the brevior.            In the male (No. 11) the coal
esced muscle gave       off two tendons, which had the usual insertions of the
longior and brevior.        In No. 2 it gave off three tendons, the middle one
being that of the muscle called by the author the extensor inter-medias,
which was inserted with the brevior.           In the female (No. 32) there arose
in the left arm, from the combined muscular belly, no less than four ten
dons, of which the inner, corresponding to that of the brevior, was the
largest and subdivided into two (making <U+FB01>ve in all), the super<U+FB01>cial one
of which was inserted into the bases of the second and third metacarpals,
and the deeper into that of the third only.           The outermost tendon, repre
 senting    the  longior, was    inserted into the base  of the second metacarpal;
 while the two intermediate tendons united at the lower end of the radius,
 to be inserted together, on the inner side of the longior, into the base of the
 index-metacarpal.        This coalescence of the <U+FB02>eshy bellies of the longior and
 brevior has been alluded to as an absence of the extensor brevior, with the
 longior supplying two tendons, by Meckel (Muskellehre, S. 509), quoting
 Albinus (Hist. Muse. p. 446), and Salzmann, and also by Macwhinnie and
 Henle. Theile mentions it as a union of the longior and brevior (op. cit.
 p. 226).       Meckel remarks upon its resemblance to the arrangement in the
 lower animals, and after him Macwhinnie and Henle. The construction
 in the female (No. 32) somewhat resembles the formation in the Rumi
 nants; that in the male (No. 2) <U+FB01>nds its counterpart in the Hyaena and
  Brown Bear.        In the right arm of N0. 7, and the left of N0. 12, the ten
  don of the longior was split into two, both having the normal insertion.
      In the female (No. 21) the longior gave off a large muscular slip to join
  the supinator longus high up. This resembles the doubleheaded supinator
  longus found by Mivart in the Iguana tuberculata, the second head of
  which arose with the extensor carpi radialis (Proc. Zool. Soc. June 1867,
  p. 783).
       Extensor carpi radialis accessorius.—The         above-described doubling of
   the tendon of the longior forms, apparently, the <U+FB01>rst point of transition to
  the abnormality found in no less than seven subjects (viz. Nos. 4, 6, 10, 15,
   & 17, males, and Nos. 27 & 29, females).           In these a slip from the outer
   side of the tendon of the longior had a detached insertion into the base of
   the pollen-metacarpal and into the       <U+FB01>rst dorsal  interosseous muscle.    Such
   slips have this session been very closely looked for as intermediate transi
   tional forms of the muscle which has been described and <U+FB01>gured by the
   author in former papers as the extensor acccssorius.          In the male (No. 4)

the insertion of this       outer   tendinous  slip from the longior was found in
both arms, and was so signi<U+FB01>cant that it has been chosen as the subject of
<U+FB01>g. 6.       Leaving the outer side of the longior tendon and but slightly in
ferior to it in size, just above the radial styloid process,              Fig. 6

it crossed the depression of the “tabatiére” under the
extensor tendons of the thumb, and reached the <U+FB01>rst
interosseous space. There it subdivided into two slips,
the outer one of which was inserted into the inner part
of the base of the puller-metacarpal (a) ; and the inner,
 spreading out into a sort of aponeurosis, was <U+FB01>rst at
 tached to the base of the index-metacarpal (b), and then
 passed into the united origins of the abductor indicis
 (interosseus prior indicz's of Albinus) (c), and of an
 interosseus primus volaris of Henle (d).            The <U+FB01>rst dor
 sal interosseus was entirely divided into two muscles, of
 which the posterior (e) arose from the contiguous meta
 carpals     quite distinctly from the deeper muscle (c),
 which also arose by a bifurcated origin, one from the
  index—metacarpal, and the other from the slip of the
  accessorius tendon under description, in common with
  the interosseus volaris.         In the <U+FB01>gure, the dorsal por
  tion is cut off close to its two origins to show the deeper
  part.     In the same arm was observed an extensor-z'nter
  medias tendon, also leaving that of the longior (f),
   rather higher than the accessorius, and joining that of
   the brevior (g) at its insertion into the second and third
   metacarpals.      The thumb-extensors        are in the <U+FB01>gure
   cut 08' close to their origins and insertions.
       In this specimen we have clearly some light thrown
   upon the way of the formation of the anomalous exten
   sor accessoriua.       The abnormal muscle is produced
   simply by lateral differentiation and displacement of the
   outer part of the muscle and tendon of the longior, a                       a}
   process which stops, in the specimen just described, at                Q4
                                                                       w" 55'
   the tendon only.
       In the left arm of the male      (No. 6)   a similar slip from the longior was
   inserted into the base of the pollen-metacarpal, and was continuous with
    the deep origin of the <U+FB02>exor brevis pollicis, there being no interosseus
    volaris present.     In the right arm of No. 10 the same abnormal tendon
    was even larger than the normal one of the longior, and there were decided
    marks of a division of the muscular belly into a distinct muscle.               The
    accessory tendon divided about an inch above its termination into an inner
    slip inserted into the outer tubercular projection of the base of the index
    metacarpal, and an outer one which subdivided; one of the subdivisions,
    being inserted     into  the base    of the pollex-metacarpal,    gave   part origin

   gins   of  the abductor      indicis and deep head of the <U+FB02>exor brevis pol
   licis. On the opposite arm of the same subject, the longior had simply
  a double tendon, each part of which was inserted into the base of the
  index-metacarpal, one crossing under the other in a curious way.               In the
  left arm of No. 15, and in both arms of No. 17 also, the tendon of the
  longior gave off a slip to the pollex-metacarpal.             The female (No. 27)
  had a similar slip in the left arm, and No. 29 in the right arm.              In the
  opposite arm of the former was a complicated arrangement of the extensor
  intermedius.
      The foregoing accessory slips of the extensor carpi radialis longior
  would not be observed in a casual dissection of the part, the normal
  and abnormal parts of the tendon being closely applied to each other and
  divided by a mere chink.          It is only by following closely the tendons to
  their ultimate insertion, and removing the dorsal interosseous fascia where
 it    covers and conceals them, that the real insertion becomes apparent.
  Hence it appears that this abnormal slip, though now found to be not in
 frequently preent, has never before been recorded.             Maewhinnie mentions
 that the tendon of the longior is sometimes inserted partly into the dorsal
 fascia of the hand (op. cit. p. 191); and Heister (in Haller’s Disp. Anat.
 Select. t. vi. p. 739) describes a blusculus radiaus czternus tricornia,
 two tendons       of which      were inserted into    the <U+FB01>rst,   and the third into
 the second metacarpal bone.           These may have been instances of the same
 formation.
      The fully formed        muscle    and tendon     of the accessorius was much
 more adapted to challenge attention; but after a careful and prolonged
 search among the works of the older anatomists (kindly placed within his
 reach by Professor Sharpey), the author has found that only one incom
 plete example has been recorded.              The specimen referred to is described
 by G. Fleischmann          (in   Abhaudl.    der  physikalisch-medicin. Societiit zu
 Erlangen, 1810, Ed. i. S. 28, with a <U+FB01>gure by Loschge, Tafel I. <U+FB01>g. 2).
 It   was an example (found in both arms of a woman) of that variety of the
 muscle in which the tendon is not inserted at all into the pollex-metacar
 pal, but passes bodily into one           of  the muscular   bellies  of a double   or
 divided abductor pollicis brevis.            Such  a specimen    was <U+FB01>gured by the
author in his paper of 1854.           The absence of any bony attachment to the
pollex-metacarpal seems to have obscured the real nature of the muscle. It
was called by Fleischmann “ der :weibiiuchiger Abzielzer des Daumens,” or
“ abductor pollicis biceps.” It seems to have been the identical specimen
obscurely alluded to by Meckel under that name (Muskellehre, S. 517),
                                                                                      ”
and mentioned by Cruveilhier under the head of “ abductor pollicis brevis
as a double-headed abductor of the thumb.               Henle also seems to have fol
lowed this indication of a digastric long abductor of the thumb (Muskellehre,
S. 224).
     In   175   subjects   in which     the author   has had   this   muscle carefully

1868.]         Mr.   J. Wood      on Variations in Human Myology.                507
looked    for,  it   has been found      as  a muscle   and tendon,  distinct   from
the   extensor    carpi radialis longior, in 6 subjects ; viz. 5 males, in 3 in
both arms, and in 2 in the right arm only, and in 1 female, where it was
found in the left arm only.          In Cuvier and Laurillard’s plates of the dis
section of the Common Seal (Plioca vitnlina, pl. 19), is <U+FB01>gured a slip of
tendon from the single radial extensor of the carpus to the pollex-meta
carpal, sending off a slip to join the insertion of the extensor pollicis.
Humphry also describes the same slip as inserted simply into the pollex
metacarpal in that animal (Journ. of Anat. and Phys. May 1868, p. 306).
In the great Anteater and Tamandna, Meckel describes a double or second
supinator longus, of which the tendon of one is inserted into the ensiform
bone and palmar fascia.           This appears to be the homologue of the acces
sorius.    The author has also found its homologue in the Ornithorhynchus
and Echidna.
    25. Extensor carpi radialz's intermedius.—The muscle and tendon de
scribed by the author under this name, or its representative tendon
passing between the longior and brevior, have been found this session in no
less than 13 subjects.         In the male (No. 1]) and in the female (No. 22)
it was represented by        a muscular belly distinct from those of the longior
and brevior, an arrangement which has been recorded by Albinus, Meckel,
and Theile.      In the left arm of the former subject, the muscular slip left
the origin of the longior ; and the tendon, after crossing between that of the
longior and the radius, gave off a slip to the tendon of the brevior, and
was <U+FB01>nally inserted into the index metacarpal inside the longior.             It was
in the right arm of this subject that the radial extensors were blended, as
before described.       In the males (Nos. 2, 5, & 16) and in the females (Nos.
27   &  34), intermediate tendinous slips came off from both the longior and
brevior (see <U+FB01>g. 7 b).         A similar case is recorded by Bergman (Handschr.
Notiz.)   and   quoted    by   Henle. In Nos. 2 & 5 these slips simply joined
together to be inserted into the index metacarpal inside the longior.              In
the right arms of N05, 16 & 27, the slips crossed each other without join
ing, to be inserted with the opposite longior and brevior tendons respec
tively.    In the right arm of No. 34, two slips from the longior and one
from the brevior united in a single tendon, which subdivided to be inserted
with the longior and brevior respectively, as in the Ruminants. In the
left arm of No. 27 the double slips united into one, which crossed under the
tendon of the brevior to be inserted into the middle metacarpal bone on its
inner or ulnar side. In four males (in Nos. 4 & 15 in both arms, and in
 12 & 18 in the left arm only) and in two females (in the left arm of
Nos. 30 & 34) the slip passed from the longior above to the insertion of
the brevior below.        This form of divergence has been recorded by Albinus
and Smmmerring.           In another female (No. 23) the slip passed from the
brevior   above   to  the  longior below,
   Out of 102 subjects, viz. 68 males and 34 females, the ewtensor carpi ra
rlialis intermediate has      been found comnlete or incomnlete    in 32. 19 males

   26. Extenaor carpi radialis brevior.—In 16 subjects out of the 36 of
the present year, the tendon of insertion of this muscle was implanted
upon the adjacent part of the base of the second metacarpal, as well as
upon that of the third, its normal insertion.           In two of these (Nos. 15                      &
 16) this insertion  was made    by     short  but
                                                a   distinct   slip. In all the others
there  was  no  division of  the   tendon   at  its insertion.     In the right arm of
the females (Nos. 29        30)   the
                                   &   tendon    gave off    slip from its inner side
                                                                 a
to the origin of the third dorsal inleroaseaus muscle, showing               disposition a
to the formation of an insertion into the base of the fourth metacarpal, as
recorded by Albinus (Hist. Musc- p. 446), and quoted                                by
                                                                          Macwhinnie.
 In the Iguana    tuberculata,   Mivart   describes    the single radial extensor as
inserted by three tendons into the second, third, and fourth metacarpal
 bones.    Thus, at intervals, there are found in the human arm, slips from
 the radial extensors to the four outer metacarpals, the extensor ulnaris
 providing for the <U+FB01>fth. In his paper in the <U+FB01>rst Number of the ‘Jour
 ml of Anatomy and Physiology’ (Nov. 1866), the author showed the
 occasional occurrence of       special <U+FB02>ea'or also for each of the metacarpals.

                                        a                                                                is
 the <U+FB01>rst indication of that form of intermedius which passes from the
 brevior to the longior.     The latter muscle and tendon, however, seem more
prone to this <U+FB01>ssuring or differentiation than the former.
   ‘27. E's-tensor communis digitarum.—In two subjects,                             abnormalities        of
this muscle resulted from    division of its muscular belly.
                                            a                 In Nos.                                5   8:

 Brugnone, and Meckel.    In the female (No. 30) the indicial portion only
 was provided with distinct belly,-as mentioned
                               a                     Henle. In two males
                                                                     by
 (Nos.      7    &    15) and three females (Nos. 24, 33,   36) there was
                                                                 &           multi             a
 plication of its tendons.          In the female (No. 24) there were in both arms
 two tendons to the middle digit.   In both arms of the male (No. 15) there
 were two to the little <U+FB01>nger.    In the left arm of the male (No.    there                     7)
 were two each to the ring- and little digits; while     the right arm were
                                                                          in
 two each to the index and little <U+FB01>ngers, and no less than four to the ring
 digit.          In
            the left arm of the female (No. 36) there were two each to the
 index, middle, and ring-<U+FB01>ngers; while in No. 33 there were two each to
 the middle and ring.                  On the right hand of the last was            a   small fusiform
 muscle, ending in    tendon, which was implanted upon the fascia covering
                               a
 the <U+FB01>rst interosseous muscle.   All these abnormalities <U+FB01>nd    parallel in              a
 those of the extensor longus digitorum pedis.     The most noteworthy                                   is
 the last, which resembles the slip given off from the tendon in the foot to
 one of the metatarsals, described in the author’s last paper as resembling
 the formation in the Sloths and some Reptiles.
       In   the left arm of        a    muscular    female (No. ‘27),     a    large slip     of   muscle

and tendon from       the common extensor passed outwards, in the oblique
groove of theradius, to be united with the tendon of the extensor secundi
internodii pollicis at the    base of the <U+FB01>rst phalanx (<U+FB01>g. 7a).       This very
rare abnormality had its parallel also in the foot, in
a slip from the extensor longus digitorum pedis to                 Fig. 7

male (No. 25) a similar tendinous slip joined the
 tendon of the indicator.      This also occasionally has
 its homologue in the foot in     a. double tendon to the
second toe.
     28. Ewtensor minimi digiti.—With only two ex
 ceptions out of the 36 subjects, this muscle pre—
 sented a multiplication of its tendon; and in three
 instances a complete double muscle was present.       In
 the latter instances, all of which were in males (Nos.
  1,  l4, &  l7), and in both arms, the tendon of the
 abnormal muscle divided into two slips, one of which
joined the extensor aponeurosis of the ring-<U+FB01>nger.
 A    double muscle has been      found by the author in
  4 males out   of 68, and in   1 female out of 34, in all
 on both sides.      In both arms of the male (No. 10)
 and the female (No. 34), and in the right arm of
  No. 32, the extensor of the little <U+FB01>nger was provided
 with three tendons, one of which was furnished to
 the ring-digit.     In the right arms of the male   (No.
  II)   and the female (No. 20), and in the left arm of
  the male (No. 13), the muscle was provided with
  two tendons; one of which went also to the ring
  digit.   Thus, in 9 subjects, viz. 6 males and 3 fe
  males, ont of the 18 of each sex, the ring-digit re
  ceived a tendon from the extensor of the little <U+FB01>nger,
  as well as one from the common extensor.          In all
  the instances the latter was placed super<U+FB01>cial to the
  former, constituting     a close resemblance to the
  second or ulnar extensor muscle often met with in
  the lower animals.
      Out of 68 males this insertion has been found in 9, and out of 34
  females in   4; of these 9 (including 7 males) were found on both sides,
  3 in the right, and 1 in the left arm only.
      In 28 out of the 36 subjects in the Table, the tendon of the extensor
  minimi    was simply doubled, both being inserted into the <U+FB01>fth digit.
  Eleven males and 8 females were so provided in both arms, 2 males and
   1 female in the right arm only, and 6 females in the left arm only.        This
  has been found to be the case altogether in 25 out of 68 males and in 18

  out   of 34 females in 102 subjects—a          proportion of 43 per cent.     In 32 it
  was in both arms, in 4 in the right, and in 7 in the left only.           It seems to
  be the <U+FB01>rst point of transition of a slip to the ring-<U+FB01>nger.
      In the left arm of the male (No. 7), the extensor minimi digiti was
  entirely wanting.         It was, however, amply substituted by three tendons
  from the common        extensor.
      29. Eztcnsor carpi ulnarz's.—In 5 males and 1 female this muscle sent
  forward a slip of its tendon to be attached to the extensor aponeuroais of
  the liltle <U+FB01>nger.      In 2 males and 1 female this occurred in both arms, and
 in three males in the right am only.                In another male (No. 6) and a
 female (No. 31), this slip was present, but reached only as far as the head
 of the <U+FB01>fth metacarpal bone, into the upper border of which it was im
 planted.
     This curious homologue           of the peroneus quinti of the leg has been
 found     by   the   author    in  12 per    cent. of subjects,—viz. in 10 out of
 68 males (7 of       which   were  in  both  arms,  and 3 in the right only), and in 2
 only out of 34 females (in l in both arms, and in the other in the left
 only). Thus it is 2% times as common in the male sex as in the female.
     30. Eztensor oasis metacarpi pollicis.—In all the 36 subjects of the
 Table, except 1 male and 2 females, this muscle was provided with two
 or more tendons.           In the 72 subjects of the Tables of the present and
 last year it has been found to be the case in 49.                In the male subject
 (No. 5)    the   division   extended   to the  formation,  in both  arms, of two dis—
 tinct muscles, the inner one of which was inserted by a single tendon into
the base of the pollex metacarpal; and the outer was provided with not
less than four tendons, three of which were also inserted into the same
bone, while the other          gave part origin to the opponem pollicia.        In this
subject the extensor primi internodii was present, and inserted, with the
secundi, into the extreme phalanx.             In both arms of two males, and in the
right only of three more, there were three tendons to the muscle, of which,
in two instances, two were inserted into the metacarpal, and the third into
the trapezium, or gave part origin to the opponens or abductor pollicis
muscles.       In one subject, one of the tendons was inserted into the meta
carpal bone, trapezium, and opponens respectively ; and in another, into the
metacarpal, opponens, and abductor respectively.                In one, the tendon of
the extensor primi         internodii   came also from this muscle.      In both arms
of two females and in the left arm of a third, two of the tendons went
to the metacarpal bone, and the other to the trapezium and abductor, or
to the latter only.        In the opposite arms of those subjects in which three
tendons were found on one side only, there were always two tendons—one
inserted into the metacarpal, and the other into the opponens and abductor
pollicis.
     In  24  subjects, viz. 9 males and 10 females on both sides, 1 male and
 1
    female  in  the right arm only, and 2 females and 1 male in the left only,
the tendons of the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis were two in number.

 1868.]        Mr.     J. Wood     on Variations in Human Myology.                  511
In   7 of these, both the tendons were inserted only into the metacarpal. In
 14, the supernumerary         one was inserted into the trapezium also.         In 8 of
them, slips were given also to the origin of the opponens pollicis; in 3, to
that of the abductor; and in 4, to both these muscles.                  In two instances
only, the second tendon joined the opponens or abductor without being
connected with the trapezium—much resembling the slip of the exten
eor carpi radialia accessorius before described, by producing a digastric
abductor of the thumb. The latter has apparently been confounded by ana
tomists with the abnormality under description.               In the Orang-ontang, the
author found the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis provided with a double
tendon, one implanted into the trapezium and giving origin to the oppo
nens pollicis.      In most of the lower species of Monkey and Mammalia its
tendon is single; its differentiation is therefore an evidence of elevation
of  type.
    31. Eztensor primi inter-nodii         pollicia.—In six cases the belly of this
muscle was blended indistinguishably with, that of the extensor ossis me—
tacarpi pollicia.        From this sprang three or more tendons, one of which
was inserted into the base of the <U+FB01>rst phalanx of the thumb.                 Three were
in males, and three in females.            Three were in both arms; two in the right
and one in the left only.           This arrangement has been found in 4 out of
40 males, and in 4 out of 30 females.
   In   5 males,    1   in both arms,     2 in the right and 2 in the left only, the
tendon    of   this    muscle    was    inserted entirely into the ungual phalanx,
either in conjunction with or by the side of that of the exfemor aecunzli.
   In 3 males and 2 females the tendon, though having chie<U+FB02>y its
normal     insertion,     sent forwards     a   slip   to  the same destination.    This
last arrangement has been found in 12 subjects out of 70.
   In the male (No. 7) there were two slips of tendons to this muscle
in the right and three in the left arm; of which two on one side, and one
on the other, passed forward to join that of the extensor secundi.
   In three subjects both muscle and tendon were entirely wanting—in
the female (No. 19) in both arms, in the female (No. 22) and in the
male (No. 14) in the left am only.                   Also in the left arm of the female
(No.30)      the   tendon     only (apparently from abortive development) was
represented by       a   slip reaching from the styloid process of the radius to
the base of the <U+FB01>rst phalanx of the thumb, exactly as recorded in a subject
in the author’s last paper.           On the right arm of the same subject the
tendon    was very feeble, and came entirely from among those of the
extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis.             The muscle and tendon have been
found entirely, or almost wholly wanting in 2 out of 68 males, and in 3
out of 34 females, a proportion in the latter sex of three times as many as
in the former.

the tendon    of this     muscle was double, both         having the normal insertion.

females in the right arm, and in 1 male and 1 female in the left only.
 In the left arm of No. 22, in which the extensor primi was altogether
 absent, the secundi sent off a substitutory slip to the <U+FB01>rst phalanx.           In
the left arm of No. 33, a slip from the secundi was given to the <U+FB01>rst pha
lanx, and one from the primi was sent forward to the ungual phalanx,
forming a mutual compensation (see <U+FB01>g. 8, c, d).
    33. Ertensor indicis.—In         the left arm of the female (No. 33), the sub
ject of many abnormalities,        this muscle was found to be quite doubled, a
tendon     from each going       to the usual insertion.    The tendon only was
 doubled     in 3 males in both arms—and in 3 fe
 males,    1 in both arms, and 2 in the left only.          Fig-8(Subject N0-33)
 In  the left arm of a male (No. 15) the muscle                               \
arose from the radius, carpus, and interosseous
 ligament, and not at all from the ulna.            In both
 arms of the female (No. 35) it arose in common
 with an extensor medii digiti, from which also the
 index received a third slip of tendon, in addition
 to those from the double indicator          (see <U+FB01>g. 8 a).
 A   double    tendon or muscle to the indicator has
 been found in      11 out of 102 subjects, viz. :—in 6
 males, on both sides; and in 5 females—2 in both,
 and 3 in the left arm only.
    3-1.  Extensor pollicis et indicis.-—In       one  male
 (No. 11), in the right arm, and in two females
 (No. 32 & 36), in both arms, were found the
 curious muscle        <U+FB01>rst  described    by the author
 under this name.         Arising between the extensor
 secundi and extensor indicis, from the hinder sur
 face of the ulna       and adjacent    interosseous   liga
 ment and intermuscular         septum,   the  muscle  ends
 in a single tendon, which, passing in the common
extensor sheath, divides on the carpus into two
 tendons.      The inner is inserted either separately
into   the base of the      <U+FB01>rst phalanx, or joins the
 common     extensor aponeurosie of the index; while
 the other passes outWards to join either the e:
 tensor primi or secundi internodii of the thumb.
 In   both the females its pollex-tendon joined that
of the secundi, while its index-tendon joined wholly
the common        extensor in one, and sent part of its
<U+FB01>bres    to the base      of the <U+FB01>rst phalanx in the
other.
    In  the right arm of the male subject (No. ll), the origin of the muscle
was peculiar and differed from all the other specimens.                 Instead of
arising from the uhia with the other muscles, it arose more super<U+FB01>cially

1868.]          Mr.  J. Wood     on Variations in Human Myology.                 513
from the intermuscular         septum, between the extensor cornm_unis and ex
tensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, forming a layer intermediately placed, and
appearing, at <U+FB01>rst sight, to be connected with the deep surface of the
common extensor.          lts pollex-insertion was with the tendon of the secundi ;
and at its indicial it joined the outermost of the tendons of a double indi
cator to be inserted into the base of the <U+FB01>rst phalanx.            This origin of the
muscle seems to form an intermediate link, and to connect it with the
somewhat       similar   abnormality     of the extensor communis      digitorum    in
 subject 27 (see <U+FB01>g. 7 a).
     35. Extensor medii digiti.~—-In          2 males (1 in the right arm, and the
 other in the left), and in 4 females (2 in both arms, 1 in the right, and l
 in the left), this muscle was found arising in common with the indicator,
 the lower <U+FB01>bres of which gave of? a tendon to be inserted into the base of
 the <U+FB01>rst phalanx of the middle digit.            In 2 females, in both arms, it was
 found as a separate muscle arising, below the indicator, from the ulna and
 interosseous ligament.         In the right arm of one of them (No. 28) the
 muscle had a peculiar origin from the intermuscular septum between the
 extensor communis digitorum and supinator brevis, higher and more super
 <U+FB01>cial than the rest of the deep muscles.              Forming afusiform belly, it
 ended in a long tendon, which was inserted into the extreme or ungual
 phalanx of the middle <U+FB01>nger, internal to the common extensor, crossing
  the <U+FB01>bres of insertion of the interosseus.          This abnormality, again, has a
 resemblance to the variety of the extensor pollicis et indicis just described
  in the male (No. 11).           In both arms of No. 33 (the subject of <U+FB01>g. 8)
  the muscle (6) was distinct and gave all“ two tendons, of which the inner
  was inserted into the base of the middle          digit; and the outer subdivided
  into two slips, one to join the inner tendon of a double indicator, and the
  other to be inserted upon the middle metacarpal fascia.          This hand showed
  a remarkable complexity          and profusion of the special extensor muscles.
      Out of 102 subjects this special extensor of the middle <U+FB01>nger has been
  found 4 times in the 68 males, and 7 times in the 34 females, giving a
   proportionate frequency of nearly four in the latter sex to one in the for
   mer.    It is a muscle constantly present in the Quadrumana.
      36.  Extensor    brem'a digilorum manila—In 3 male and 3 female sub
  jects, slips of muscle were found on the dorsum of the hand, arising,
   distinct from the dorsal interossei muscles, from the os magnum or unciform
   bones, and inserted into the common extensor aponenrosis of one or more
   digits.   In the right hand of No. 3, and the left of No. 7, males, and in
   both hands of No. 21, a female, there was but one slip, which was inserted
   with the tendon of the second dorsal interosseus into the middle digit.
   In  both hands of No. 2, male, there were three slips, arising respectively
   from without inwards from the os magnum, unciform and cuneiform bones.
   The outer was inserted with the second dorsal interosseus into the middle
    digit—and the two inner on each side of the <U+FB01>fth digit, with the abductor
   and interosseus respectively.        In  the female (No. 23) there were two slips,

514         Mr.    J. \Vood   on Variations in Human Myology.            LJ line 10,
in both hands,     one from the os magnum to the middle digit, and the other
from the unciform to the ring-digit.     In the female (No. 33), the subject
of the last <U+FB01>gure, the right hand, only, showed three slips, arising from the
dorsal aspect of the bases of the second, third, and fourth metacdrpals
and their dorsal ligaments, and inserted into the corresponding digits.
   In 68 males this muscle has been found by the author in 7, and in 34
females in 3—giving nearly an equality in the sexes.     In looking over the
works of the older anatomists, the author <U+FB01>nds that short single dorsal slips
to the index or middle <U+FB01>nger had been observed by Albinus, and described
                 “
by him as the liIuacnlus ewtenaor brevis digiti indicis vel medii” (Acad.
Annot. lib. iv. cap. vi. p. 28, and tab. v. <U+FB01>g. 3, 1734). A single slip from
the carpus to the index is described by Gantzer as an indicator biceps
(op. cit. p. 14), and similar ones by Otto as an “indicator anomalus brez'is"
(Seltene Beobacht. S. 91), arising from the radius in one instance, and from
the third metacarpal in another.     In two other male hands the last-named
anatomist found a slip from the carpus to the middle <U+FB01>nger, which he calls
the “ ewtensor anomalus brevis des Mittel<U+FB01>ngera.”   Stemmerring, Petsche,
and Sandifort have described slips which might be confounded with these,
but which refer rather to the true indicator giving o<U+FB01>' an extensor medii
digiti.  In all of them, however, the slips were single, and did not form
the broad <U+FB02>at muscle described by the author in his former papers.    It is
remarkable that they were all found in male subjects.   The short common
extensor of the digits is represented in the Bradypus tridactylus, in the
two-toed Anteater,     and in the Saurian,        Chelonian,   and Batrachian   Rep~
tiles, according to Meckel (Anat. Comp. vol. v. pp. 386, 388, & 391, and
vol. vi. pp. 346 & 351, and Archiv, v. p. 47).
   37. Abductor pollicis.—In 2 males and 2 females this muscle was divided
into two portions, rather widely separated at their origins from the trape
zium and annular ligaments respectively.    In the 2 males and in 1 female
this was the case in both hands, and in the other female in the left hand
only.   In the two males there was, in addition, a considerable muscular
slip from the inner of the two to join the <U+FB01>bres of the opponens pollicis in
                                                        -
their insertion.
  38. Abductor minimi         digiti.—In   the right hand of the male (No. 2) a
separate muscular head from the anterior annular ligament joined the ten
don of this muscle at its insertion.  In both hands of No. 3 the muscle
was double, the <U+FB02>ewor brevis being absent.   In the left arm of No. 11 the
muscle was arranged in two parts, viz. the normal origin, and a high origin
2% inches above the wrist.    The latter arose by two heads, one <U+FB02>eshy,
from the fascia covering the <U+FB02>ezor carpi ulnaris, and the other tendinous,
from the tendon of the palmaris longus.           These united above the wrist to
form a <U+FB02>eshy muscle, larger than the normal origin, and placed external
to it,
     which became united with    just before its insertion.
                                     it
  This abnormality has        been found in   3  males only out of [0‘2 subjects of
both sexes examined by the author.         It   has been described by Sccmmerring

   1868.]        Mr.   J. \Vood   on Variations in Human lilyology.            515
   (op. cit. p. 272).    It was also found by G<U+FB01>nther and Milde (Die chirurgische
   Muskellehre, T af. 30. <U+FB01>g. 5. 18). In the right arm of a muscular soldier
   Gantzer found a <U+FB02>eshy muscle connected with the insertion of the abductor
  minimi digiti, arising from the sheath of the <U+FB02>ewor—carpi-radialia       tendon,
  to which he gave the name of the “ accessorius ad <U+FB01>erorem carpi radialem"
   (op. cit. p. 12), which was evidently a muscle of the same character as the
  foregoing.     Macwhinnie mentions similar high origins of this muscle,
  arising from the tendon of the palmaris longus, as varieties of the last
  named muscle (op. cit. p. 191).         This abnormal upward extension of the
  origin of the abductor minimi digiti seems to correspond to the shortest of
  the three muscles representing the ulnar carpal extensor found in the
  Anteater (Meckel, Archiv, B. v. S. 45, It).        In both hands of the female
  (No. 20) the muscle was provided with a double tendon of insertion; and
 in the right hand of No. 33 the whole muscle was divided into two parts.
      39. Inleroseei manila—In both hands of 4 males and 3 females, and in
 the left only of one other female, the “interoaseus primus colaris” of
 Henle was found. In No. 4 this muscle, as before described, was connected
 at its origin with an accessory slip of the extensor carpi radialis longior
 (see <U+FB01>g. 6 d).       It has been found in 12 out of 102 subjects, usually on
 both sides.      In the males (Nos. 3 & 4) the <U+FB01>rst dorsal was separated
 into two muscles, the abductor and interoseeus prior indicie of Albinus.
     40. Sundries.——Besides the scapula-clavicular and c/zondro-coracoid
 muscles described in the former part of the paper, in subjects 4 and 13,
 this column marks in the male (No. 7) an abnormality of the infra-sca
pular    muscle, which consisted in a separate origin and distinct super<U+FB01>cial
 position of the <U+FB01>bres derived from the spine of the scapula.         In the right
 arm of the female (No. 21) the supinator longus received a large muscular
 slip from the extensor carpi radialis longior, as described with the abnor
mality of the latter muscle.         On the right side of No. 35 two large <U+FB02>eshy
 slips from the ninth and tenth ribs, and on the left side from the eighth
also, quite separate and somewhat distant from the rest of the serratus
magnua, were inserted into the lower angle of the scapula, with the lower
<U+FB01>bres of that muscle, which reached no lower than the seventh rib.           This
differentiation of the lower <U+FB01>bres of the serratus resembles the depressor
scapula: muscle found in the Birds.          The female (No. 36) was remarkable
for the very rare absence, in the right hand, of the palmaris brevie muscle.
     The remaining sixteen columns are occupied by the abnormal muscles of
the Leg.       The additional lines of variation are partly composed of muscles
which have not been before especially regarded (such as the pyrzformia,
gemelli, and opponens minimi digiti) and partly of more numerous speci
mens of abnormalities presented by those which were before comprised in
the column of sundries (as the plantaris, peroneue brevis, and adductor
hallucis).
    41 & 42.    Pyriformie     and Gemelli.-—In    3 males and 1 female the ten
don of the pyri/‘ormis was blended with          that of the oblu-ralor  inlernua

and inserted with it into the groove of the great trochanter.            In one of
these males (No. 4), and in the female (No. 19), the superior gemellus,
which usually intervenes, was entirely absent on both sides, and in one
other male (No. 17) on the right side only.        In the other instances it was
inserted into the common tendon. On the right side of the female (No. 19)
the inferior gemellus was also absent.         In two females the pynformis
muscle was divided into two parts, between which passed a portion of the
great sciatic nerve.    This is a frequent and striking abnormality usually
noticed by anatomical writers upon the subject.
   43. Plantaris.——In the right leg of the male (N0. 3) a double muscular
belly was found, both joining a single tendon rather larger than usual.          In
both legs of the female (No. 22) a muscular slip, nearly equal in size to
the normal belly, passed from the inner side of
its origin to be inserted upon the posterior h'ga-        Fig 9 (subject No_ 7)_
meat of W'z'nslow, close to the insertion of the semi
membranosus-tendon,     and under the inner head of
the gastroenemius.     This curious slip appeared to
be an instance of a development of muscular <U+FB01>bres
in the substance of a tendon, similar to that un
usual one which is seen in the tendon of the pe
roneus quinti (<U+FB01>g. 10).      In its origin and direc
tion,  however, it has some resemblance to the
third head of the gastrocnemius muscle found in
the left leg of the male (No. 7), and marked in
the Table among the sundries (col. 56). It may,
 perhaps, be most convenient to describe it in this
place.    A <U+FB02>eshy tapering head of muscle of con
siderable size arose from the middle portion of the
popliteal surface of the femur just above the con
dyles (<U+FB01>g. 9, a).    Opposite to the knee-joint it
was joined on the outer side by a broad tendinous
slip (b), arising from the posterior ligament of
Winslow close to the plantaris muscle             The
two on joining, formed a considerable bundle of
muscular <U+FB01>bres, which, increasing slightly as it
 descended, joined the inner head of the gastrocne
miua just before its union with the outer.        This
abnormality resembled in some respects that de
scribed by R. Quain (plate 80. <U+FB01>gs. 4 & 5), in
which a third head, arising from the outer femoral
condyle, crossed the space between the popliteal
artery and vein, and <U+FB01>nally joined the deep sur-                  .
face of the outer head.       Henle also describes a         w      ' "7
third head, arising from the popliteal surface
of the femur, and ending in a cylindrical tendon which                spread   out

       and united     with the point of junction of the soleus and gastrocnemius
        (Muskellehre).     Theile also met with such a supernumerary head (op. cit.
                                                '
       p. 316).
           44. Flexor longus digitorum     and lumbricales    pedis.—In  2 males  (Nos.
       4 &   l2)  and 4 females (Nos. 22, 27, 29, & 30) the tendon of the <U+FB02>erur
       longua digitorum gave a considerable slip in the sole to join that of the
     <U+FB02>avor lunyus hallucis, as well as received one from it. In 1 male it was found
       in both feet; and in the other, as well as in 3 out of the 4 females, in the
       right foot only; in the remaining female it was present in the left foot only.
           This slip has been especially noted only in the present year, and returns
       an average of about 18 per cent.       Schultze of Rostock found it in 29 sub
      jects out of 100, and usually on both sides (Zeitschrift <U+FB01>ir wissenschaft.
       Zool. xvii. 1).    Nearly the same proportion was found by Turner in 50
      subjects (Edinb. Phil. Trans. xxiv.).         The slip did not in our subjects
      seem to be in any way compensatory for any want of size in the tendon of
      the <U+FB02>exor hallucis; for in one female (No. 22) that tendon was unusually
      large even before the junction.      In the female (No. 27) the <U+FB02>exor hallucis
      received also a slip of reinforcement from the <U+FB01>eaor accessorius.         In the
      foot of No. 29, female, the perforatiny tendon to the second toe was derived
      wholly from that of the <U+FB02>exor hallucis, the common <U+FB02>exor supplying only
      the three outer toes.      In the right foot of the male (No. 11) the perfora
      ting common flexor of the third toe gave of? a slip of reinforcement to the
     perforated opposite to the base of the metatarsus.
          In the male (No. l) the fourth lumbricalis was absent in both feet. In
     the left foot of No. 9 the same muscle was double and bifurcated, and
     inserted into the contiguous sides of the fourth and <U+FB01>fth toes.         In No. 8
     the third lumbricalis was double in both feet, and inserted into the con
     tiguous sides of the middle and fourth toes.
         According to Froment           cit.), varieties in the pedal lumbricales are
     very rare.      Gantzer had previously stated the same thing (op. cit. p. 17).
     In the notes of Smmmerring, quoted by Theile, Behrends is said to have
     observed the absence of the two middle ones.          Rudolph, quoted by Gantzer
     (op. cit),    found the third absent in the left, and the fourth in the right
  ‘
     foot of a muscular male.
         Out of 102 subjects examined, the second lumbricalis pedis was found,
    in one, absent on both sides; in one, the third arose from the tendon of
     the perforatus instead of the perforans; in another, it was double on both
     sides; the fourth was absent in three subjects—in one on both sides, in
    one in the right, and in one in the left foot only ; in one the same muscle,
'
    in both feet, was      doubled, bifurcated,   and inserted into contiguous sides
    of the corresponding toes.       This gives a proportion of only 7 per cent. of
    abnormalities in these muscles, contrasting widely with the frequency of
    irregularity of the same muscles in the hand.
         45. Flexor longus hallucis.—In both feet of a male (No. 17) the tendon
    of this muscle gave no slip to that of the common <U+FB02>exor.           In both feet of
                                                                      2 x 2

a female     (No. 31) the slip was, on the contrary, unusually large.        In the
right foot of another (No.27) it received a considerable slip from the
<U+FB02>ezor accessorius, as well as from the 'common <U+FB02>exor. In a third (No. 29)
it supplied the whole of the perforating tendon to the second toe, after
receiving only a very small slip of <U+FB01>bres from the common <U+FB02>exor.
     46. Eztenaor primi internodii hallucis [angina—In all the 18 males ex
 cept two, and in 13 out of the 18 females, the base of the<U+FB01>rst phalanx of
 the great toe was the point of insertion of a more or less considerable slip
of tendon, described by the author        in former papers under the above name.
 In all except three it existed in       both feet, in two in the right foot, and
 in one in the left only, exhibiting an unusual uniformity in this respect.
     In 3 males (Nos. 5, 7 & 11) the tendon was derived from that of the tibi
  nlis anticus, leaving it a little above the ankle.
    This curious parallel to the peroneus quinti on the outside of the foot,
had been previously found by the author in <U+FB01>ve other male subjects—in
four in both feet, and in one in the right only.              The frequency of its
occurrence is in about 8 per cent. of subjects, although this variety seems
to have escaped the observation of anatomists.          In the male (No. 15) the
tendon existed in the right foot only, as a well-de<U+FB01>ned and strong <U+FB01>brous
band connected with the anterior ligament of the ankle-joint, with a distinct
insertion into the <U+FB01>rst phalanx of the great toe. It was totally unconnected
with any other tendon. This instance presents a curious parallel to the like
occasional abortive development of the homologous tendon in the hand, viz.
the eztensor primi internadii pollicis, which has been described in these
pages as having been found, in two instances, connected solely with the
styloid process of the radius, close to the posterior ligament of the carpus.
     In all the rest of the subjects in which this tendon was found, it was an
offset of that of the extensor proprius hallucis, and was inserted either
singly into the middle of the dorsal border of the base of the <U+FB01>rst phalanx,
or joined with the innermost tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum in
the same insertion.       Sometimes it was connected separately with the lower
muscular <U+FB01>bres of the proprius, which showed, by a disposition to separate
from the rest, a tendency to form a separate muscle, such as that described
by the author in his former papers, and recorded by Meckel (Archiv, Bd. v.
S. 117), and mentioned by Theile and I-Ienle (Muskellehre, S. 277 - The
slip of tendon from the extensor propriuo is recorded by Saammerring (op.
cit. p. 323) and by \Valther (in Haller’s Disp. Anat. Select. vol. vi. p. 559).
     47. Eztensor longua digitorum pedis.—In No. 1, male, this muscle
 divided into four separate bellies, one to each tendon.        The outermost was
joined by two slips     from  that  of the  peroneus tertius,  which  was split into
 three parts.     In the left leg of the male (No. 6) a tendon of reinforcement
was given off in the opposite way, viz. from the outermost of the extensor
 longus to the middle of the upper border of the <U+FB01>fth metatarsal bone.            In
the right leg of the female (No. 35) the same abnormality           occurred in the
 shape of two tendons to the <U+FB01>fth metatarsal.

 1868.]         Mr.   J. Wood     on Variations in Human Myoloyy.              519
    Nearly the same arrangement was found in both legs of a male last year,
making a proportion of 3 in 70 subjects.               It was found, according to
Meckel, in the Sloths and Reptiles.
    In the female (No. 33) a slip was given from the second tendon of the
extensor longua to that of the extensor brevis, as found in a male in last
year’s series.      This was noticed by Macwhinnie (op. cit. p. 195) joining
the great-toe tendon of the brevis.
    48. Peroneus tertius.—In 15 subjects, viz. 8 males and 7 females, this
muscle presented abnormalities of various kinds.            The most conspicuous
was its entire absence in the right leg of one male (No. 8) and two females
(Nos. 21 & 23).        In the left leg of the male its tendon was very small, and
was lost upon the fourth interosseous fascia and muscle, not reaching the
metatarsus.
    Out of 68 males this muscle has been found to be absent in 5, and out
of 34 females in 5 also, giving a proportionate frequency of de<U+FB01>ciency
exactly double in the females.             In the 5 males it was wanting in 1 on
both sides, in 3 in the right, and in 1 in the left leg only.               In the
5 females it was wanting in l on both sides, in 3 in the right, and in
 l in the left leg only.      It would thus seem to be absent most frequently
in the right leg.         In the only instance in which the left leg only is
recorded,     the representative in the right leg was a mere slip from the
extensor-communis-digitorum            tendon, which could scarcely be called a
peroneus.       This   muscle   is  uniformly absent in the Quadrumana and all
the lower      animals, and appears to subserve especially the erect position
peculiar, among mammals, to the human subject.
    In both legs of the male (No. l) and in the right leg of the female
(No. 35) the tendon of the peroneus tertiua gave o<U+FB01>' slips of reinforcement
to the outermost tendon of the extensor tongue digitorum, in front of the
ankle.    In both legs of No. 16 a similar slip joined that of the extensor
brem's.    In 5 males and 4        females   it was provided with two tendons or
split.   In both legs of N0.       4, and in the right leg of Nos. 5 & 9 (males),
both the tendons were inserted separately into the <U+FB01>fth metatarsal bone,
one close to its base, and the other about its middle.          In the right leg of
Nos. 7 & 9 (males), and N0. 27 (female), in the left leg of No. 8 (male),
and in both legs of No. 29 (female), one of the double tendons, or a slip
from a single tendon, passed forward to join the fourth interosseous fascia
or muscle.       In both legs of No.18 (male), and in the left of No.19
(female), the tendon of the peroneus tertius was implanted wholly upon
the fourth instead of the      <U+FB01>fth metatarsal bone; and in both legs of N0. 34
(female)   it  was   mainly  inserted    into the fourth, giving o<U+FB02>‘ a slip only to
the <U+FB01>fth.
    Altogether in 102 subjects these varieties of redundancy were found to
be half as many again in males as in females, contrasting widely with the
greater frequency of de<U+FB01>ciency in females before described.
    49. Peroneus brevis.—In the male (N0. 3) the posterior <U+FB01>bres of this

 muscle were connected with a distinct tendon, rather smaller than the normal
 one, which, passing in the groove and sheath of the peroneus longus, was
 implanted upon the outer margin of the cuboid bone behind its peroneal
 groove.     A similar instance has been recorded by Macalister.                It is of the
 same character as the peroneus quartus of Otto, which was inserted into
 the calcaneum.
    The peroneus quartus has been found twice in 70 subjects by the author.
 Meckel describes it in the Kangaroo. In 1 male and 1 female the tendon
 of the brevis was found, in both legs, to give off a slip of reinforcement
 to that of the Mrtius.
    50. Peroneus quinti.—This variety, constituted uually, in the human
 subject, by a slip of tendon from that of the peroneus brevis, given off
 below the outer ankle and joining the extensor aponeurosis of the little toe,
 was found in the male (No. 11) to have developed upon it a complete,
 distinct, and fusiform      muscular

brevis in the usual way, became spread out in front and lost upon the upper
border of the <U+FB01>fth metatarsal             bone about its middle—an incomplete
arrangement, said by Mr. Davis to be found also in the Civet Cat                      (Journ.
of Anat. and Physiol. May 1868, p. 217).
    Out of 102 subjects, in the 68 males the complete muscle has                         been
found once, the complete           tendon in 18, and the incomplete tendon in 5,
making 24 in the males.           In the 34 females the complete tendon has been
found in 5, and the incomplete form in 8, making 13 in the females.                      This
gives about an equal average         in the two sexes.

     5]   .   Earlensor brevia digitorum.—In 4 males the tendon from this muscle
 to the secondtoe was found doubled;    l was found on both sides, 2 in the right
 foot, and l in the left only. In 3females the same arrangement occurred;
 in l in both feet, in l in the right, and in l in the left only.    In 2 0f the
 males (Nos. 4 8t 8) the supernumerary tendon was inserted separately into
 the base of the <U+FB01>rst phalanx.    In the rest it joined, like its fellow, the
 extensor aponeurosis.   In the right foot of one male (No.3) and one
 female (No. 22) the <U+FB01>bres of the muscle to the second toe gave a tendinous
slip to the <U+FB01>rst interosseoua muscle and fascia.                   This is doubtless an im
perfect form of the same abnormality.
     Out of 40 males the former arrangement    has been found in 6, and the
latter in 3   in 30 females the former was found in 3, and the latter in 1,—
                   ;
giving a total of 13 in 70 subjects.
   52. Abductor oasis metatarsi quinti.——This muscle, <U+FB01>rst described and
<U+FB01>gured by the author in his paper of 1864, arising from the outer tubercle
of the calcaneum, and inserted into the tubercle at the base of the <U+FB01>fth
metatarsal bone, covered and concealed by the abductor minimi digiti and
the insertion of the peroneus brevic, has been found this year in [9 subjects
out of the 36, viz. in 11 out of the 18 males and in 8 out of the l8females.
Of    the males, 5 were found in both feet, 3 in the right, and 3 in the left
foot only.   Of the females, 5 were found in both feet, 1 in the right, and
2 in the left foot only.   It has been described by Professor Huxley and
Mr. Flowerin            the foot of the Gorilla and Chimpanzee, and has been found
by the author in that of the ()rang-outang           and Bonnet-Monkey; and also,
lower in the scale, in the Cat, Hedgehog,  and Squirrel he has found evi
dences, though less distinct, of its presence.  It is <U+FB01>gured by Strauss
Durckheim in the anatomy of the Cat.       Mivart and Marie describe it in
the Hyrax, and the former observer also in the Iguana tuberculata.    In
the Echidna also are <U+FB01>bres answering to this muscle.  Meckel describes a
similar muscle in the Makis, the Brown Bear, and the Coati.
     Out of 68 males the author has found this muscle in 27, viz. in                  19   in
 both feet, in 4 in the right, and in 4 in the left foot only; out of 34
females he has found it in 16, viz. in 10in both feet, in 3 in the right, and
in 3 in the left foot only,——-giving a proportion of about 43 per cent. of all
the subjects, and a frequency of l in the male to                  1;}
                                                        in the female sex.
   53. Flezor brevis digitorum pedis.—ln         males and  3 females (in one
                                                                         3
of the former in both                 in the right foot only, and in
                                     feet, and   in   2               of the      2
latter in both feet, and in the other in the right foot only) the outermost
tendon of this muscle to the little toe was absent, as in the Quadrumana.
In some, substitutory slip of muscle, arising from the corresponding ten
               a
don of the pmforans or long <U+FB01>exor, was discovered, but often no trace of
a perforatus tendon could be found in the digital sheath.   In the right
foot of the male (No.     slip of tendon from the perforans of the middle
                                     8)   a
digit became blended with the perforatus at the metatarso-phalangeal joint.
In   the same foot           11   well developed fusiform   muscle arising from the tendon

 of the peiforans supplied the perforated tendon of the little toe. In the
 right foot of No. 11 along slip from the <U+FB01>exor-longus-a'igilorum                     tendon
joined that of the <U+FB02>aw brevis going to the middle toe—as before described
 with the varieties of the former muscle.               In the left foot of the same sub
ject   a similar   tendinous    slip   to   the <U+FB02>exor brevis tendon of the middle toe
 arose from the <U+FB01>bres of      the    accessorius.
     Out of 68 males the outer tendon of the <U+FB01>ezor brevis digitorum has been
 found absent in 10, viz. 6 in both feet, 3 in the right, and l in the left
 only. Out of 34 females it has been found absent in 5, viz. in both feet in
  4, and in l in the right only.           This gives a proportion of 15 per cent. and
 an exact equality in the two sexes.                 In 4 of these, viz. 3 males and 1
 female, at substitutory slip of muscle and tendon arose from the corre
 sponding tendon of the perforans, as in the Quadrumana.                    In one this was
 connected partly with the <U+FB01>bres of the accessorius, and partly had a separate
 origin from the tubercle of the calcaneum.
     54. Abductor hallucis.—A considerable slip from this muscle to the
 second toe, arising with the front <U+FB01>bres, and inserted into the base of the
 <U+FB01>rst phalanx, as <U+FB01>rst found and described by the author in his paper of
 last year, was seen this year in three males and one female.                 In one of the
 males   and  in  the female   it  was    found  in  both   feet,  in one male  in the right
 foot, and in the third in the left foot only.             A similar slip is said by Meckel
 to be found in the foot of the White Bear.
     Out of 40 males this slip has been found in 5, in 2 in both feet, in l
in the right, and in 1 in the left foot only.              Out of 30 females it has been
found in    1  only, in both feet.
     55. Opponens minimi digiti.——This muscle, <U+FB01>rst pointed out by Henle
 as frequently present in the human foot, has been noted this year in 6 sub
jects out of 36, in 1 male and 5 females.                In 4 it was found in both feet,
in l in the right and in l in the left foot only.                 In 1 female in last year’s
 series it was   found,   remarkably large,       in  both   feet. The author has found
 this muscle largely developed in the Orang.                    In the Bonnet—Monkey it
 was not present.        It is <U+FB01>gured in Cuvier and Laurillard’s plates as very
 large in the foot of the Lion and Panther.
     56. Sundries.—Besides the three-headed gastrocnemius already de
 scribed, we have in this column, in the male (No. 4), an entirely detached
 portion of the iliacus internus, arising from the middle of the iliac crest
 by a thin tendinous aponeurosis, forming a <U+FB02>at muscular slip, which was
 inserted into the common tendon of the psous and iliacus muscles.                        In
 both feet of the female (No. 20) the abductor minimi digiti was provided
 with two distinct tendons.           In the left leg of the female (No. 22) a con
 siderable   <U+FB02>eshy slip from the adductor brevis joined the tendon of the
 obturator externue.        In the right foot of the female (No. 27) the tendi
 nous slip from the insertion of the tibialia poetic-us to the outer cuneiform
  bone,  which usually gives part origin to the <U+FB02>ezor brevia hallucis, passed
 wholly into that muscle without being connected with the cuneiform.                      In

   1868.]        Mr.   J. Wood    on Variations in Human Myology.                523
  the left leg of N0. 29 a considerable muscular slip passed from the origin
  of the pectineua muscle across the deep femoral artery to join the <U+FB01>bres of
  insertion of the adductor longus.          This slip was noted in two subjects in
  last year's series.     It is also mentioned by Macwhinnie (op. cit. p. 194),
  and is found in some of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, and Rodents.
     In the right leg of the female (No. 33) was found a complete specimen
  of the <U+FB02>aw accessorius digilorum longus pedis, arising by a single penni
  form belly from the lower third of the outer border of the <U+FB01>bula and the
  posttibial fascia, and ending in a tendon which joined that of the <U+FB02>ezor
  digitorum longus at the point where the normal “massa carnea Sylvii”
  was connected with it.
     This abnormal muscle has been found in 4 male subjects out of 68,
  and in 1 female out of 34.          In all it arose from the lower third of the
<U+FB01>bula     and   the  fascia covering the <U+FB02>exor longus hallucia.        In 3 of the
  males it was found in both legs.         In the fourth male and in the female it
  was found in the right leg only.
     On reviewing the foregoing 18 males and 18 females with reference to
 the Table, it will be seen, as might be expected, that the greatest absolute
 number of abnormalities in the vertical columns (reckoning both sides as
 one) is found in those muscles the variations of which have been hitherto
 best known       to anatomists.     These   have been   noted to ascertain simply
  their exact frequency.
     Of  supernumerary      tendons of the extensor minimi digiti and extensor
 0ssia   metacarpi pollicis there are 33 instances—l only of the males and
 2 of the females, and these latter in the same individuals          presenting the
 single insertion described in most anatomical manuals.               The coronoid
 origin of the <U+FB02>exor pollicis longus is seen in 27 subjects, only 5 males
 and 4 females not possessing it.           Slips of junction with the <U+FB02>exor pro
fundus digitorum were found in 3 subjects.               The extensor primi inter
 nodii hallucis longus is found in 29 subjects, only 2 males and 5 females
 not possessing it.        The peroneua quinti tendon is found in 20 subjects,
  10in each sex. Next comes the abductor oasis metatarsi quinti in 19
 subjects,   ll  of which are males—a much larger proportion in that sex than
 was found in last year’s series.          The extensor carpi radialis brevior and
primi internodii pollicis      each give 18 abnormalities, 9 of which in the latter
 muscle were instances either of partial amalgamation or total absence, 4 in
 males and 5 in females.         The peroneua tertius presents abnormalities in
  15 subjects, 2    of which are instances of total de<U+FB01>ciency, and both of them
 in females. This is curious when compared with the greater frequency of
 absence in the same sex of the extensor primi internodii pollicis.            Both
 these muscles are eminently human muscles, and are never found even in
 the highest of the Simiadre.         The absence of the two muscles does not,
 however, seem to be correlated;         it is not found in the same individual in
 any of the cases.       The cleido-occipilal, palmaria longus, and <U+FB02>avor pro un
 dus (Iigitorum      come next in frequency,       each in 14 subjects, and   nearly

equally in the two sexes. The ea‘tensor carpi radialis longior (with the
accessorius) and the extensor communis digitorum are found abnormal in
12 subjects, and the extensor secundi internodii in 11.             These numbers
accord, relatively and proportionately, pretty closely with their parallels in
last year’s series.
    The greatest number of abnormalities          in each subject is found in the
males :-—No.      7 having no less than 25    (the greatest number, it is believed,
ever found in one subject), of which 17 are in the arms, and 5 only in the
legs; and No. 11 having 24, of which 14 are in the arms and 6 in the legs.
N0.    17 has 20,   of which  13 are  in the arms and 7 in the legs. In all these
the greatest number is found in the arms.              But, on the other hand, we
<U+FB01>nd that No. 4, having also 20 abnormalities,          has 9 in the arms and 10 in
the legs.
    Of the females, No. 33 has 20 abnormalities, of which 15 are in the
arms and 5 in the legs; while No. 29 has also 20, of which 11 are in
the arms and 8 in the legs.         In some, the proportion of the number of ab
normalities    in the arms to those in the legs is even greater than the above-—
as, for example, in the males No. 10 (in which it is 11 to I), No. 13
(12 to 2), Nos. 2 8: 6 (10 to 2), and in the females No. 31 (12 to 2),
and No. 23 (10 to 2).         In the male No. l the abnormalities in the arms
and legs are equal, 6 in each; and in the female No. 21 they are also
nearly equal, 8 in the arms and 7 in the legs.        In only one subject, the male
No. 8, is the number of abnormalities in the legs (8) greater than that
in the arms            The smallest number of abnormalities is in No. 14 (male),
viz. 5 in the arms and 2 in the legs; and in No. 26 (female), 1 proper
to the head, 2 connected with the arms, and 1 in the legs.
    In, estimating the total number of abnormalities, both sides of the body,
 when alike or nearly alike, and complications affecting mutually two or
 more neighbouring muscles, are, for the sake of convenience, reckoned as
one instance.       296 are found in the 18 males, and 262 in the 18 females,
 making    a grand total of 558.       Of the 296 in males, 13 are found in the
 muscles proper to the head and neck, 24 in those connected both with
 the head and neck and arm, 182 belonging to the arms only, and 77 to
 the legs only.      Of the 262 in females, 7 are found in those proper to the
 head and neck, 16 in those connected with the head and neck and arms,
 168 belonging     to the arms only, and 71 to the legs only.'
    The proportion of those in the arms to those in the legs in the two
 sexes is much more nearly equal         in this year’s than in last year's subjects
 (in  which   the   latter predominated), and amounts to about 5 in the arms
 to 2 in the legs.      All the lines of variation observed in former years, ex
 cept the occipito-scapular,       supracostalis, and a few other less    important
 muscles, have been noted in this year’s series.
    Of   the 296 abnormalities found in the 18 males, 173 have been found
 on   both sides, 62 on the right side only, and 61 on the left side only,
 making 123 single or one-sided specimens.            Of the 262 found in the 18

 1868.]     Easy <U+FB01>lellwd of     measuring   Intensity of Total Daylight.       525
females, 138 have been       found on both sides, 55 on the right side only,
and 69 on the left side only, making 124 single or one-sided specimens,
and giving rather fewer on the right and more on the left side than in the
males.     In the females,  also, it will be observed  that the proportion of the
abnormalities    found   on both sides to those found     on one side only in the
same sex, is much less than in the males.       This is found to depend upon the
smaller number      found  in both arms of the female, viz. 96 in the females
to 125 in the males, while      the number found in the left arm only of the
females is 51 compared with 38 in the males; and that found in the right
arm only of the females is 29, compared with 36 in the males.              On the
other hand, the number found in the left leg only in the female is but 10,
in comparison with 13 in that of the male, and with 20 in the right leg
only of the former sex.
   The disproportion in this particular comes out still more markedly when
the whole number of 102 subjects comprised in the Tables of the three
last years, viz. 68 males, and half that number, or 34 females, is taken into
consideration.
   The number of abnormalities        in the 68 males is 414 on both    sides, 108
on the right, and 101 on the left side only, making 209 one-sided speci—
mens. The number of abnormalities in the 34 females is 209 on both sides,
08 on the right, and 81 on the left side only, making 149 one-sided spe
cimens.
   Thus in the females we <U+FB01>nd a proportionate preponderance to the
amount of about 45 one-sided specimens ; and these are mainly composed
of those on the left side only.
   The total number of abnormalities in the 102 subjects is 981, of which
623 are in the 68 males, and 358 in the 34 females.            The number found
on both sides is 623, of which 414 are in the males and 209 in thefemales.
The number found in the right side only is 176, of which 108 are in the
males and 68 in the females.         The number found on the left side only is
 182, of which 101 are in the males and 81 in the females, making a total
of 358 one-sided specimens.
XVIII.      “ On an
                       Easy Method of measuring approximately the In
      tensity of Total Daylight.”          By ROGER. J. William, Esq. Com
      municated by Professor STOKES, Sec. R.S.                 Received May 21,
      1868.
   An easy method by which the amount of light may be at any time mea
 sured and registered appears to be still wanting.           I would suggest the
                              I
following plan, by which believe the desired object may be attained.
    AB   is a rod of solid metal, terminated by a heavy base, which keeps the
 rod in a perpendicular position.      C D is ahollow tube, blackened inside, of
such a diameter as exactly to <U+FB01>t and slide over A B. The extremity, B, of
the rod   A B is painted of a snowy white, with a jet-black spot in the centre,

  526 Easy Method       of measuring Intensity of Total Daylight.     [June 18.
  as shown in the <U+FB01>gure.      On A B is marked the scale, beginning with zero
 at  A.   The tube is pushed over the rod till the extremity C coincides with
 the zero line at   A.
    The method of using this instrument is as follows:—Draw the tube
 gently up the rod, at the same time looking steadily at the black spot
 before mentioned.      It will be found, as the tube ascends, that the black
 spot  will gradually disappear, and ultimately vanish in the gloom; it will
also be found that on di<U+FB01>‘erent days, and di<U+FB02>'erent hours of the same day,
 the point at which the blaclc spot vanishes will vary with the intensity of
the light.     This point is read off on the graduated scale, and thus we are
enabled to measure the intensity of the light at any required time.           In
taking an observation, it would be well to state whether that portion of sky
round the zenith from which the cone of rays proceeds be clear or cloudy.
    It will be seen that the result obtained by this method is not scienti<U+FB01>cally
correct, as it will be a<U+FB01>'ected by the eyesight of the person who makes
the observation, but only in a slight degree.       The method of measuring
light, as just described, has been known to me for upwards of three years.
The hope that I should some day be enabled to make the instrument
scienti<U+FB01>cally correct has hitherto prevented me from making it public.
As I understand that it is highly desirable to have some means of esti
mating the changes in the light which will occur during the total eclipse
of the sun in August next, I no longer feel justi<U+FB01>ed in keeping in the back
ground an instrument which may possibly be of some slight assistance.

                                                          Nov. 1867.
    Dr. BENJAMIN GUY BABINGTON was born in 1794. He was the son of
 Dr. William Babington, who, in his time, held a foremost place as apopu
lar and successful London physician.         Educated at the Charter House, he
 subsequently went through the usual course of study at Haileybury College
then required of young men destined for the Indian Civil Service; he
went out to the Madras Presidency as a member of that service in 1812.
After remaining seven years in India, he was compelled by ill health to re
turn home, and then determined to leave the Indian Service and adopt his
father’s profession. With this view he entered at Pembroke College, Cam_
bridge, and took the degree of MB. in 1825, and that of MD. in 1830,
In the meantime he commenced practice in London, and in 1831 was
elected a Fellow of the College of Physicians.        For the prosecution of his
medical studies in London he had chosen Guy’s Hospital, where his father
was physician, and he was himself appointed assistant physician to that
Institution in 1837, and promoted to be one of the physicians in 1840.
    Dr. Babington was much esteemed as a clinical teacher, and was the
author of papers on different professional subjects, published in the Guy’s
Hospital Reports, and elsewhere ; but he also engaged in researches of
more general scienti<U+FB01>c interest, and among them his observations on the
blood, published in the ‘Medico-C'nirurgical Transactions' of 1830, de
serve especial mention, inasmuch as he there showed that the liquid part
                                                    ”
of the circulating blood, or “liquor sanguinis        (a name proposed by him
to distinguish it from the serum, and very generally adopted since), really
contains or yields the coagulable matter, or <U+FB01>brin, which solidi<U+FB01>es in the pro
cess of coagulation.    This, no doubt, was merely a con<U+FB01>rmation by simple
but well-devised experiments of the doctrine held by Hewson and his con
temporaries, and accepted by most British physiologists ; but the con<U+FB01>rma
tion was needt'ul and well timed on account of the erroneous views then
prevailing on the continent on the authority of Prevost and Dumas.           At
a later time, namely in 1859, Dr. Babington         communicated to the Royal
Society a series of observations on the effect of various salts dissolved in
water in retarding or otherwise altering the rate of spontaneous evaporation,
and an abstract stating the nature and results of the experiments was pub
               ‘              ’
lished in the    Proceedings    for 1859.
    In the establishment of the Sydenham Society, since succeeded by the
new Society of the same name, Dr. Babington took an active share.            Up
to the time of its dissolution he acted as Treasurer, and contributed to its
                                           ‘
publications an elegant translation of Hecker’s Epidemics of the Middle
Ages,’ besides aiding in the revision of other works published by the So
ciety.    The Epidemiological      Society, founded in 1850, owes its origin
mainly to his exertions.     He was its <U+FB01>rst President, and continued in that
    iron. xvr.                                                       b

 otlice, taking part with unabated interest in its useful labours,  till within a
 short time of his death.
     It remains to be added that Dr. Babington was a man of varied accom
 plishments.    He  had a re<U+FB01>ned taste in art, and applied his hand in some of
 its departments with no mean success. He had great readiness and skill in
 devising and constructing apparatus and instruments of various kinds, and
 mechanical appliances for the ease and comfort of the sick.     Itis especially
 worthy   of note that in 1829 he  communicated    to the Hunterian    Society of
 London a method of inspecting the fauces and glottis in the living person
 by means of a small mirror passed back into the throat ; so that, for aught
 that appears to the contrary, Dr. Babington is entitled to the credit of
 having made the <U+FB01>rst practical step in the art of laryngoscopy.
     Dr. Babington was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1828; in
 1861—63    he served on the Council.      His death took place on the 8th of
 April, 1866.
     WILLIAM THOMAS BRANDE, D.C.L., F.R.S.,           was born on the 11th of
 January, 1788, in Arlington Street, St. James’s, London, and died at Tuu
 bridge Wells on the 11th of February, 1866, in the seventy-ninth         year of
 his age.
     When about six years of age he was placed in a private school at Ken
sington, where he remained four years.       At this school he made tolerable
progress in the rudiments of the Latin language, and learned to read Greek.
On leaving it he was sent to Westminster, where, during a period of eight
years, he made fair progress in classical and general knowledge.             His
father, who was an apotheeary, suggested that he should select the Church
for his future career; but he preferred the medical profession, and on the
2nd of February, 1802, according to the custom of those days, he was
bound apprentice to his brother, who was a Member of the Society of Apo
thecaries.    The family removed from Arlington Street to Chiswick, and
here it was that Mr. Brande <U+FB01>rst became acquainted with Mr. Charles
Hatchctt, whose daughter he subsequently married.         Mr. Hatchett at this
time was much occupied in chemical investigations, and it appears to have
been from his conversation and example that the subject of this memoir
<U+FB01>rst acquired a strong attachment to Chemistry and Mineralogy.          He often
assisted Mr. Hatchett in his laboratory, and he received from him speci
mens of minerals which formed the foundation of a collection which he
kept up through life.     He was then simply a schoolboy fond of science,
and this feeling was encouraged and developed by the kindness and atten
tion of Mr. Hatehett.      He had then no idea that chemistry would be his
future profession.
    In the year 1802, when in his fourteenth year, he paid a visit to his
uncle at Hanover. and here he acquired a good knowledge of the French
and German languages.       In the spring of 1803 he visited Brunswick and
Gi'ittingen; but all his plans of study were interfered with by the breaking

                                          iii
out of the war and the approach of the French to Hanover.               With some
dif<U+FB01>culty he escaped to Hamburg, and reached London after passing a
month at sea in a Dutch merchant-vessel.
    In   1804 he resumed his duties as apprentice to his brother, and in the
autumn      of that year, and in the seventeenth year of his age, he became a
pupil at the Anatomical and Medical School in Windmill Street.                 He
attended the lectures of       Mr. Wilson and Mr. Thomas, and it was during
this period of study that he made the acquaintance of Brodie (the late
Sir Benjamin), Maynard, Ewbank, and other professional men of repute.
He now studied chemistry under Dr. George Pearson, and became one of
his pupils at St. George’s Hospital.           He here made the acquaintance of
Dr. C. R. Pemberton, and by the aid of this gentleman he acquired a con
siderable knowledge of disease and a great liking for the practice of physic.
About this time also he found a friend in Sir Everard Home, who was then
in the zenith of his reputation.
    A weekly meeting was held on Saturday evening at the Windmill-street
School: this was founded on the ruins of the once celebrated Lyceum
Medicum, and it may be regarded as the parent of the Westminster Me
dical Society.       The meetings were attended by many medical men of
repute;      medical   and scienti<U+FB01>c papers were read and discussed; and as
chemistry was very often the subject of inquiry, Mr. Brande found that he
was frequently referred to as an authority on matters connected with this
 science.     Writing of this date, Mr. Brande states :—
     “ I  was now   full of ardour in its prosecution (i. e. of chemistry) ;   and
 although my brother, with whom I still lived, whose apprentice I was,         and
in whose shop, notwithstanding         all other associations, I still worked  and
 passed a large part of my time, threw every obstacle in the way of             my
 chemical progress that was decently in his power,        I  found time, however,
 to read, and often to experiment in my bedroom late in the evening.              I
 thus collected a series of notes and observations which          I   fondly hoped
 might at some future period serve as the basis of a course of lectures, and
 this in time they actually did.       It was at this period that, in imitation of
                                 I
 Mr. Hatchett’s researches, made some experiments on Benzoin, the results
 of which were published in Nicholson’s Journal for February 1805.”
     This, it may be remarked, was his <U+FB01>rst chemical contribution to scienti<U+FB01>c
 literature.     He was then only about sixteen years of age.           Mr. Brande
 also contributed     to the same journal for June 1805 a paper on Respiration,
 which had been read to the Westminster Medical Society.
     His <U+FB01>rst introduction to Sir Humphry Davy was about the year 180],
 when     he was a boy at Westminster         School, then in his thirteenth year.
 He was introduced to Davy at the Royal Institution, which had been re
 cently founded.        After his return from Germany in 1804, he renewed his
 acquaintance with Davy, and, as a result, his zeal in the pursuit of che
 mistry was greatly augmented.          Sometimes he stole away from home, or,
 instead of going to the Anatomical School in Windmill Street, contrived
                                                                       b 2

                                           iv
to get admitted to one of Davy‘s lectures at the Royal Institution.         It ap
pears that at this time he formed a resolution of losing no opportunity that
should    present itself to enable him        to take the of<U+FB01>ce of a lecturer   on
chemistry.
    In  the autumn of 1805 he drew up an account of some experiments on
Guaiacum      resin.   This formed the subject of a paper presented by Mr.
Hatchett, and read before the Royal Society on the 19th of December.
It was   printed in the ‘Philosophical Transactions’ for 1806. He now became
acquainted with Sir Joseph Banks.            He was frequently consulted by Sir
Everard Home on chemical and physiological questions; and by the advice
of Sir Everard he was entrusted with the analysis of the calculi then in
the collection of the College of Surgeons.         The results were communicated
in a letter to Sir Everard, which was read before the Royal Society on the
 19th of May, 1808, and published in the Transactions with some observa
tions by Sir Everard Home.          Two other papers relating to the state and
quantity    of alcohol  in fermented   liquids were published in the Transactions
for 1811 and 1813. For these he was presented with the Copley Medal
in 1813.
     The winter of 1808 was an important epoch in Mr. Brande‘s life. He
being then in his 21st year, commenced lecturing, and gave two courses of
lectures on pharmaceutical chemistry at Dr. Hooper’s Medical Theatre in
 Cork Street, Burlington Gardens.           These lectures were so well received
that    Mr.   Brande   was invited    in the ensuing autumn to join the new
Medieo-Chemical       School established     by Mr. Wilson in Windmill Street.
 Dr. Cooke and Mr. Brande lectured there on alternate mornings on physio
pud chemistry; but the weight of the entire course fell chie<U+FB02>y on Mr.
Brande.       Dr. Cooke withdrew from the lectures, and in 1813 Mr. Brande
joined Dr. George Pearson, who gave medical lectures at his house in George
 Street.    Mr. Brande gave a course of lectures on Materia Mediea at Dr.
 Pearson’s, and at the same time continued the course of Chemistry at the
 small laboratory which he had <U+FB01>tted up in Windmill Street.
     On the 13th of April, 1809, being then only 21 years of age, Mr. Brande
 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and took his seat on the 20th of
 that month.       This at once brought him in contact with all the leading
 scienti<U+FB01>c men of the day, including Cavendish, the elder Herschel, hIaske
 lyne, and \Vollaston.      To all these he soon became intimately known.
     On the 4th of November, 1812, Mr. Brande accepted the appointment of
 Professor of Chemistry and Superintending Chemical Operator to the Apo
 tllccaries’ Company.       This gave him the opportunity of remodelling many
 of their pharmaceutical processes, and of raising them to the level of the
 improved state of chemistry.        There can be no doubt that Mr. Brande
 aided in an important degree in resuscitating the character of the Society
 and giving to it a scienti<U+FB01>c status.       The late Mr. Hennell was his pupil.
Mr. Brande was made Professor of Materia Medica, and he delivered an
 nually a course of lectures on that subject.

                                         v
    In  the spring of 1812, Mr. Davy (afterwards Sir Humphry Davy), with
whom     Mr. Brande was on cordial and intimate terms, delivered his last
course of lectures in the Royal Institution.        On the occasion of his man
riage at this date he resigned the chair of Professor of Chemistry in the
Royal Institution, and invited Mr. Brande to deliver for him a course of
lectures which he had been in the habit           of giving annually before the
Board of Agriculture.     These lectures were delivered gratuitously by Mr.
Brande; but in the following year this Board was dissolved.
    In the winter of 1831, Mr. Brande gave a probationary course of Che
mistry at the Royal Institution, and in May of the same year he was unani
mously elected Professor of Chemistry.          In the autumn of this year he
took possession of the apartments that had been occupied by Sir Humphry
Davy, and was then completely installed as his successor.          Sir Humphry
went abroad and did not return for two years.
    In October 1815, Mr. Brande transferred the pupils from his School of
 Chemistry in Windmill Street to the laboratory of the Royal Institution,
and he commenced a regular and extended course of lectures on this science.
 In consequence of the death of Dr. Pearson, the chemical lectures were also
transferred from St. George’s Hospital to the Royal Institution.             His
lectures were well attended and contributed to raise the reputation of the
Institution as a seat of practical instruction.     He was subsequently assisted
in these lectures by Mr. Faraday.          Mr. Brande devoted himself at this
time entirely to chemical pursuits and to lectures on the science.
    In 1823 he was consulted by the Government and drew up a report
on the manufacture of iron and steel. The manufacture of the metal for
coinage formed a part of the inquiry; and the of<U+FB01>ce being vacant in 1825,
Mr. Brande was appointed Superintendent of the Die Department at the
 Royal Mint. In [854, he resigned his professorship in the Royal In
stitution,  and was made Superintendent      of the Coining department at the
Mint.
    It  was in the year 1825 that Mr. Faraday became associated with
 Mr.   Brande in the lectures delivered at the Royal Institution.        He also
had the assistance of    Mr.   Faraday   in the publication of the ‘Quarterly
Journal    of Science and the Arts,’ edited at the Royal Institution. This
publication was commenced in 1816, and was carried on until 1836, when
it fell into other bands and was soon discontinued.         In 1836 Mr. Brande
was named one of the original Fellows of the University of London, and a
Member of the Senate of that Body ; and in 1846 he became Examiner in
Chemistry, an of<U+FB01>ce which he retained until 1858.          He received the hono
rary degree of Doctor of Civil Law in the University of Oxford.          He was
a  Fellow of the Royal Societies of London and Edinburgh, and of many
other British and Foreign Societies.         From 1816 to 1826 Mr. Brande
was one of the Secretaries of the Royal Society.
    Mr. Brande was the author of a ‘Mauual of Chemistry,’ which went
through six editions, of a ‘ Dictionary of Pharmacy and Materia Medica,’

                                             vi
and of a smaller volume on Chemistry, especially designed for students,
published in 1861. In 1842 he undertook the editorship of the Dictionary
                                                                         ‘
of Science and Art,’       a most laborious    undertaking; and at the time of his
death he was occupied in revising a          new edition of this work.     His scien—
ti<U+FB01>c contributions to periodical literature        were also very numerous.        _
   From 1808 to         1855-1, the long period of forty-six years, the subject of
this memoir had        been before the public as a lecturer on chemistry.          He
was indefatigable      as a teacher   of this science. In addition to the lectures
regularly delivered at the Royal Institution and the Society of Apotheca
ries, Mr. Brande lectured for some time on chemistry to the classes at St.
Bartholomew’s Medical School.             Many of the past and present generation,
whether    in  or out   of the   medical  profession, owe much of their knowledge
of this science to his teaching.          The substance of his lectures is incorpo
rated in the great work by which he acquired a European reputation,
               ‘
namely his Manual of Chemistry.’ .This work was, in its day, one of the
most popular in the English language, and there are few recent treatises on
the subject which are not indebted to its pages for much valuable informa
tion. He found chemistry an ill-arranged collection of facts, and succeeded
in reducing them into form and order, thus aiding greatly in the cultiva
tion of the science and in placing it on an intelligible basis.
    No scienti<U+FB01>c man who was brought in contact with Mr. Brande could
fail to be struck with the accuracy and extent of his knowledge, the reten
tiveuess of his memory, and the truthfulness and honesty of purpose by
which he was always actuated.             The friend of Gay-Lussac and Thénard
and the associate of Davy and Faraday, he formed a connecting link be
tween the chemists of the past and the present generation.                He lived to
see the most remarkable changes in the science which he had himself so
successfully cultivated, but, like his great contemporaries, he preferred de
monstration      to speculation;     and although ready to adopt what was esta
blished by experiment, however it might con<U+FB02>ict with his previous views,
he was strongly opposed to innovations based upon mere hypotheses.                   In
private   life   Mr.   Brande     was  well known     as a man   of genial character.
His conversational powers         were great, and no man could pass an     hour in his
society without retaining a pleasant reminiscence of him as a companion.
                                                                           A. S. T.
    WILLIAM BRINTON, M.D.,              was the second son of the late Mr. Henry
Brinton,    one   of the principal carpet manufacturers of Kidderminster, where
the subject of the present notice was born, on the 20th of November, 1823.
After attaining remarkable pro<U+FB01>ciency at school, William Brinton was ap
prenticed to a surgeon in his native town, and in October 1843 entered
the medical department of King’s College, having in the preceding sum
mer matriculated, with honours, at the University of London.                He passed
through his student career with great distinction, and was noted among his
fellows not only for the general ability and indomitable perseverance with
which he applied himself to intellectual          work, but especially for his unde

                                           vii
viating aim at precision and thoroughness of knowledge in all his studies.
The character he bore as a student was honourably maintained at the Uni
versity of London, where he took the degree of MB. in 1847, and of M.D.
in the following year. In the meantime he was appointed Assistant De—
monstrator ofAnntomy, and in 1850 Medical Tutor, at King’s College,
which appointment he held until 1853, when he was elected Lecturer on
Forensic Medicine at St. Thomas’s Hospital.
     To St.Thomas‘s medical school Dr. Brinton became permanently attached
by his being elected Physician to the Hospital in 1860, and appointed
 Lecturer on Physiology, having previously been associated with the late
 Mr. Grainger in that lectureship.        He soon proved himself to be an able
 and accomplished teacher of physiology; and those who have heard him
 lecture speak with admiration of his appropriate language and agreeable
 delivery, and of the ready power and happy effect with which he used his
 pencil to illustrate  his oral instructions.
     From1852 until his appointment to St. Thomas’s in 1860, Dr. Brinton was
 Physician to the Royal Free Hospital, where he enjoyed large opportunities
 of medical observation ; and during his tenure of that of<U+FB01>ce he publishedin
  ‘The Lancet’ a series of “ Clinical Remarks,” which were much valued.
  He speedily rose in the estimation of his professional brethren and gained
  the con<U+FB01>dence of the public, so that for some years before his death he en
 joyed a much larger share of consulting practice than usually falls to the
 lot of young physicians of his standing.
     When quite a young man Dr. Brinton contributed several articles to Dr.
  Todd’s ‘ Cyclopsedia of Anatomy and Physiology,’ and translated Valentin's
  ‘Text-book of Physiology’ from the German.            In 1857 he published a
  work on ‘Ulccr of the Stomach,’ and, two years later, one of more ex
  tended scope, on ‘Diseascs of the Stomach ;’ this was followed by a treatise
  on ‘ Food and Digestion.’     These works were the result of a careful study of
  a subject to which he had given special attention.      He entertained original
  views on the natural and perverted movements of the alimentary canal, and
  on the nature and cause of intestinal obstruction, and gave an exposition of
  his doctrine in the Crooninn Lectures which he delivered before the Col
  lege of Physicians.
      Three papers by Dr. Brinton were read to the Royal Society, of which
  abstracts were published in the ‘ Proceedings ; viz. “ Contributions to the
                                                    ’
   Physiology of the Alimentary Canal” (1848), “ On the Dentate Body of
   the Cerebellum” (1852), and “ Experiments and Observations on the
   Structure and Function of the Stomach in the Vertebrate Class” (1861).
   He was elected a Fellow of the Society in June 1864.
      In a memoir of Dr. Brinton which appeared in ‘The Lancet ’ soon after
   his death, from which chie<U+FB02>y we have derived the substance of this brief
   notice, it is mentioned that among his numerous tastes and acquirements
   was a love of mountaineering, and that he was a member of the Alpine'
   Club, and contributed two papers to the second. series of “Peaks, Passes,

                                      viii
  and Glaciers.”    Dr. Briuton died on the 17th of January, 1867, at the
early age  of 43.    The cause of his death was renal disease of three years
duration, against  which  he had all along borne up with marvellous courage.
    Mr. WALTER CRUM,        an eminent scienti<U+FB01>c chemist and manufacturer  of
Glasgow, was born there in 1796, and died at his residence, the Rouken,
near that city on the 5th of May, 1867. He was the second son of Mr. Alex
nnder Crum, of Thornliehank, senior partner in the <U+FB01>rm of Alexander and
James Crum, long established and much respected as merchant manufac
turers in Glasgow.     His mother, to whose family his personal characteris
tics appear to have had the strongest resemblance, was a daughter of the
late Walter Ewing Maclae of Cathkin. Having received a liberal education
at the Grammar-school      and University of Glasgow, he entered upon the
business of calico—printing, a department of the work of his father’s esta
blishment.    With a view to the conduct and improvement of this branch
of manufacture be early devoted himself to practical chemistry, and in 1818
and 1819 was an ardent student of that science in the laboratory of Dr.
Thomas T homson—at that time one of the few laboratories, if not the only
one in this country, in which analytical research was systematically prac
tised and taught.     The intimate knowledge of chemistry which Mr. Crum
 thus acquired, combined with his general scienti<U+FB01>c attainments, enabled
him to introduce many useful improvements into his own business, and
thus to maintain and increase the excellence of its manufactures.      As an
important example of these may be mentioned the well-known process of
“ orange resist” on indigo, which was invented and practised for <U+FB01>ve years
by Mr. Crum before it became known to other manufacturers.
    Mr. Crum’s ability as a chemical analyst, however, gave to his researches
a scienti<U+FB01>c interest and a value beyond that which belonged to their mere
practical application; and his <U+FB01>rst paper on the Analysis of Indigo, pub
lished in 1823 in the ‘Annals of Philosophy,’ established his reputation as
a scienti<U+FB01>c chemist, and brought him into correspondence with, and pro
cured for him the friendship of, many of the <U+FB01>rst chemists of his time,
among whom may be mentioned, as the most intimate, Thomson, Faraday,
Graham, and Liebig.         He became a member of the Royal Society in
February 1844. His other Scienti<U+FB01>c papers followed in succession from 1830
to 1861; almost all of them were communicated to and printed in the
Proceedings of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow, which he joined in
 1834, and of which he became President on the death of Dr. Thomas
Thomson in 1852.        A list of these papers is subjoined; several of
them were translated into German, and published in Liebig’s ‘Annalen
 der Chemie,’ as in vol. lv. (1845), vol. lxii. (1847), and vol. lxxxix.
 (1854).
    The most important      of Mr. Crum’s researches are those relating to
 indigo, gun-cotton, the acetates of alumina, and the dyeing of cotton-<U+FB01>bre.
 It was from Mr. Crum’s analysis of sublimcd indigo that he was led to

                                         ix
 construct the formula for that substance, which is now universally adopted.
 This analysis was made at a time when accurate organic investigation
 involved much greater dif<U+FB01>culty and the exercise of higher ingenuity than,
 with Liebig’s method, is now required; and although Erdman and Dumas
 had from their analysis of a less pure substance deduced other formulae,
 they afterwards con<U+FB01>rmed that of Mr. Crum. The very ingenious method
 proposed by Mr. Crum for the analysis of nitrates was founded on the
 conversion of the nitric acid into nitric oxide by the action of sulphuric
 acid on mercury.       He applied this method to determine the quantity of
 nitrogen  in  gun-cotton. Having determined the carbon by combustion
 with chromate of lead, he was led to the formula of CI, H, 01+3 NO, for
 the most explosive gun-cotton—a result which has recently been con<U+FB01>rmed,
 after the most rigorous investigations, by Mr. Abel and others, and it is
 now universally accepted.      The action of sulphuric acid and mercury on
gun-cotton led Mr. Crumito regard the latter as a nitrate, a view which,
 making gun-cotton analogous to nitric ether, was long opposed by nearly
 all chemists, but is now very generally adopted.
    Mr. Crum's investigation of the acetates of alumina is very able and
complete, showing the precipitating         action of very dilute solutions of
various salts on soluble alumina, in the same manner as he had shown such
action at a much earlier date in the case of the sulpho-indigotates             and
sulpho-phrenicatcs.       His papers on the peroxide of copper and on the
action of nitric acid and peroxide of lead as a very delicate test for man
 ganese are esteemed valuable contributions      to analytical chemistry.
    After the death of Dr. Thomson in 1852, Mr. Crnm delivered to the
 Philosophical Society of Glasgow a discourse on the Life and Labours of
his instructor, in which he dwelt with much feeling, ability, and discrimi
nation on the varied acquireinents and contributions            to science of that
eminent and laborious chemist.
    Mr. Crum      was   remarkable   for unbending    rectitude of purpose and
love of truth, for great aenteness of perception     and decision of character ;
and his public spirit was as notable as his perseverance in conducting to
a successful termination      whatever he undertook.         He occupied during
many years     a  high place in public  estimation,  and   took   a leading part in
every good work       having for its object the educational, social, or political
improvement      of the people.
    In his own extensive and interesting works at Thornliebank, he had an
ample <U+FB01>eld for the energetic practical development of his sagacious and
benevolent plans for the moral and intellectual improvement of the nume
rous workmen in his employment.          For upwards of forty years Mr. Crum
devoted much time and personal effort to furthering the interests of An
derson’s University in Glasgow, of which he was a most liberal and effec
tive patron and supporter.      His election to the Presidency of that valu
able institution gave him ampler opportunity for indulging his favourite
desire of bringing scienti<U+FB01>c     knowledge   within reach of the artisan and

                                             X
the general public.          In many other ways be contributed       to promote the
cause of popular education.
     Mr. Crum’s character was marked by clear intelligence and strong
practical sagacity, unbending love of truth and justice, frank sincerity,
great kindness of heart, generosity, and active and judicious benevolence, but
so unsel<U+FB01>sh and        of such retiring modesty that he shrunk from the slightest
display.      Few men have lived more usefully, or have died more esteemed and
regretted.

being dyed, “coton mort,” both of which subjects he had studied very
profoundly.          The results of these important and dif<U+FB01>cult investigations,
illustrated      by numerous engravings,       were published in the Journal    of the
Chemical        Society for 1863.
     Josapn Envr.        was born at Plymouth Dock (Devonport) in 1791.            He
entered the Navy in 1805, and served as secretary's clerk under Sir John
Duckworth, on board the Superb in the action off St. Domingo
                                                                           (for which
he in afterlife received a medal), and also on board the Royal George, 100

                                        xi
guns, at the passageof the Dardanelles.         He attained the rank of Pay
master in 1811, and after service in the Erne was employed as Secretary
in 1823 and 1824 to the Hon. Alexander Cochrane at Plymouth, from
 1824 to 1827 to Lord de Saumarez at the same port, and from 1828
to    1834 to Sir Pulteney Malcolm in the Mediterranean            during the
paci<U+FB01>cation     of Greece and the expulsion of the Egyptians from the
Morea,     where he acted as British    Commissioner    at the headquarters of
Ibraham     Pasha, in concert with the Commissioners    of France and Russia,
for the purpose of rescuing from slavery about 2000 Greek women and
children found in the Egyptian camp, on which service he received an
injury that subjected him to severe suffering for the rest of his life.     He
was also with the same gallant commander in the North Sea during the de
 monstration made on the Dutch coast in 1832 and 1833 at the siege of
 Antwerp. From 1836 to 1839 he was with Sir Philip Durham, as secre
 tary at Portsmouth, and from 1839 to 1842 with Sir Graham Moore at
 Plymouth. He was placed on the half-pay of a sécretary in 1843, and re
 ceived a letter ofthanks from the Admiralty for his important special services
 as Secretary to the Commission consisting of Sir P. Malcolm, Sir C. Adams,
 and Sir T. M. Hardy, which framed the laborious production, ‘ The Code of
 Naval Regulations ;’ and in 1865 he was appointed Paymastcr-in-Chief, and
 received the Greenwich pension for his past service.
    Mr. Edye was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in January 1841.
 He died at his residence, Stoke, Devonport, November 12, 1866, leaving a
 widow and one son, a midshipman in the Navy.
    Sm Gnoaon Evuaasr was born at Gwernvale (Brecon), the seat of his
 father, Mr. Tristram Everest, on the 4th of July 1790.           In his early
 studies at Woolwieh he made such progress that he was found quali<U+FB01>ed
 for a commission before the age prescribed by the regulations, and
 was noticed by the Professor of Mathematics, Dr. Hutton, as one who
 would distinguish himself.      In 1806 the young cadet sailed for India,
 where he entered the Bengal Engineers, and after seven years’ service, was
  sent to join a detachment in Java.       There Lieut. Everest was selected by
  Sir Stamford Raffles, then Governor, to make a survey of the Island, in
  which   laborious task he spent two years, and afterwards returned to Ben
  gal.   He was next employed in engineering works (improving the navi
  gation of the outlets of the Gauges), and though appointed Chief Assistant
  on the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India in 1817, he remained for
  some   months in Hindoostan      to complete the establishment of a line of
  telegraphic posts  from  Calcutta to Benares.
     In 1818 Captain Everest joined the party under Lieut.-Col. Lambton,
  Superintendent of the Survey at the headquarters, Hydrabad.       Well quali
  <U+FB01>ed for this appointment by education and habit, he entered with great
  spirit on the duties by which his name has become noteworthy in the
  annals of Geodesy.     Before that survey was undertaken the topography of

                                           xii
 India was as incorrect as it was scanty ; there was an error of forty miles
 in the breadth of the peninsula as laid down in the maps, and it was in
 consequence of a resolution of the East-India Company to amend this
unsatisfactory     state of things, by making their Atlas depend on trigono
metrical operations, that the survey was commenced.
    Captain Everest was carrying the work through an unhealthy part of
the Nizam’s territory when, in 1820, his health failed, and he was ordered
to the Cape of Good Hope to recruit.           Here he employed his leisure in an
examination of the tract of country in which La Caille measured an arc of
the meridian in 1752       ; and in a letter to Colonel Lambton he reviewed the
circumstances under which the measurement had been made, and pointed out
the discrepancies between the results and those obtained in similar opera
tions in the northern hemisphere.          This letter, printed in the <U+FB01>rst volume
                 ’
of ‘ Memoirs         published by the      Astronomical     Society, led eventually
to    the remeasurement and extension          of La Cuille’s   are by Sir Thomas
Maclear.
    On the death of Colonel Lambton in 1823, Captain Everest was ap
pointed Superintendent of the Survey, and devoted himself earnestly to the
work. In the same year he took up the survey where his predecessor had
left it in the valley of Berar, and extended it into the mountainous tract
on the north.        In November 1824 he measured a base-line in the Seronj
valley, and in 1825 had carried the observations on to Bhaorasa, when
his health    again gave way, and he was compelled to seek             the restorative
climate of his native land.
   Pro<U+FB01>ting by his sojourn in England, Captain Everest made himself
acquainted with new scienti<U+FB01>c results bearing on his special pursuit.                He
was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1827.             Part of his time was
spent in drawing up an account of the progress of the survey“ subsequent
                                                                               ‘
to the operations recorded by Lieut.-Col. Lambton in the                         Asiatic
Researches,” which, with tables, maps, and plans, was published at the
cost of the East-India Company, by whose authority it had been prepared.
In this work, among the many scienti<U+FB01>c details, Captain Everest gives a
few particulars of his personal adventures in the carrying on of the work—
of the severe measures by which be disciplined his native followers and
quelled a mutiny among them—of separation from his instruments and
provisions by sudden <U+FB02>oods—of the explorations through wild jungles in
search of favourable observing stations—of journeyings through vast and
magni<U+FB01>cent forests where, more to he dreaded than tiger or hyaena, lurked
the deadly typhus which prostrated him and his whole following.                      For
months he was so weak that he had to be supported by two men while
taking his observations at the great theodolite, and could not reach out his
hand to the screw of the vertical circle without assistance; yet, though

advised to resort to the coast, he persevered with his task, having a convic
tion that his absence would be fatal to its prosecution.
    Colonel Everest     returned          to India in 1830, enabled to effect improve
ments in       the   survey,    for       he had   made himself acquainted with the
practice of the English Ordnance Survey, and with the best methods em
ployed in Geodesy in other parts of Europe ; besides which the Directors
of the East-India Company had furnished him with the best instruments
that could then be constructed.     His labours and responsibilities were
now largely increased; for in addition to his post as Chief of the Trigono
metrical Survey, he had been appointed Surveyor-General      of India. In
1832 he resumed operations on the great are, from which date it was
diligently carried on until its completion in December 184! by the remea
surement of the Beder base-line by Captain Waugh *.
   In this renewal of observations, one of Colonel Everest’s principal di<U+FB01>i
culties was the training of assistants. In some other respects the fatigue
and risk were mitigated; by the use of proper signal-lights, the surveying
could be carried on at night and during the hazy period of the hot winds,
whereby the parties were less called on for exposure during the rainy
season.  The chief himself was so indefatigable, that his contemporaries,
playing on his name, were accustomed to speak of him as Neverrest.
With his improved instruments, he was resolved to improve the Survey
and tolerate no inferiority in the execution. On this point he writes,
“   If Ihave had any reason to suspect any defect in the instrument, or any
instability in the platform, or any want of precision in the signal observed,
              I
or even if have found in drawing up the angles that they presented any
discrepancies for which          I
                             could not account,              I
                                                    have always felt not only
that     I
       was at liberty, but that it was incumbent on me to reject the whole
                                                                                        ‘

circumstances free from objection.”

             these concluding
one degrees in length had been measured by the two persevering chiefs of
the Survey and their assistants, extending from Cape Comorin to the northern
border of the British Possessions in India. Colonel Everest had speculated
on carrying it further, beyond the Himalayas and across the wild regions to
the north, until it struck the Russian triangulation within the dominions
of the Czar.   An are stretching from the Indian Ocean to the Polar Sea
would, indeed, as he himself describes   have been “a vast project.”

 Lieut.-Col. Everest one of their Honorary Members, with an appreciative
eulogium of his scienti<U+FB01>c services.           He was a Fellow of the Astronomical
and of the Royal Asiatic and the Geographical Societies.                Of the latter he
was a member of Council, and <U+FB01>lled the o<U+FB01>ice of Vice-President.                   He was
knighted and made C.B.          in  1861.    His   scienti<U+FB01>c writings  are comprised in
the two works above mentioned, in papers on subjects connected with sur
veying published in ‘Asiatic Researches’ and in the ‘Memoirs’ of the
Astronomical      Society, and in a letter on certain computation errors dis
                                                                                    ‘
covered in the logarithm tables of the Great Survey, printed in the Pro
ceedings’ of the Royal Society.
    In   1863-65,    Sir George Everest served on the Council of the Royal
 Society.     He died in London, December 1, 1866. His name having been
given to one of the highest summits of the Himalayan range, will long be
remembered in India.
    JonN Goonsm,          Professor of Anatomy in the University of Edinburgh
from l846 to 1867, was           born in the year 18l4, at Anstruther in Fife, in
which county his father and grandfather               were well known     and much re
 spected medical practitioners.
    When little more than        a boy he was sent as a student of arts to the Uni
 versity  of  St. Andrews,     where   he passed through the curriculum, but, as
 was the custom      at  that  time,   without     taking his degree.      At this early
 period of his life he was fond ofthe study of metaphysics, and imbibed the
 doctrines of Coleridge,      which indeed     gave a colour to the whole     of his  sub—
 sequent thoughts and speculations.
    Being destined to follow the medical profession, he was apprenticed to
 Mr. Robert Nasmyth, the eminent Dentist in Edinburgh, and during his
 apprenticeship     pursued     his medical     studies in the University and Royal
  In<U+FB01>rmary in that city.         His  anatomical teacher was Dr. Knox, and in his
 practical   rooms he made the acquaintance of Edward Forbes, which soon
 ripened into friendship.         For Forbes and Goodsir had tastes in common ;
 they   both  took  an  active  interest in watching the habits and tracing out the
 structure of animals, and their conjoint researches added several new mem
 bers to the British fauna.
     When he had obtained the Licence             of the Edinburgh College of Sur

                                        XV
geons, Mr. Goodsir returned to Anstruther, where, whilst assisting his
father in practice, he found time to pursue his anatomical and zoological
studies, and in 1838 brought before the British Association his observations
on the Development of the Teeth.
    Shortly after this he returned to Edinburgh to <U+FB01>ll the o<U+FB01>ice of Conser
vator of the Museum of the College of Surgeons, for the duties of which he
was well adapted, not only from his anatomical knowledge, but from his skill
in preparing and displaying anatomical and pathological specimens. He
now became a Member of the Wernerian,           Botanical,  Medico-Chirurgical,
and Royal Societies of Edinburgh, and communicated to their Proceedings
 and Transactions numerous memoirs, which rapidly brought him into notice
as an industrious    and keen observer of animal form and structure      in both
healthy and morbid conditions.        His well-known papers on Sarcina, on the
anatomy of Amphiozus Ianceolatus, on secreting structures, and on the
structure of the placenta may be mentioned as examples of his work at this
period.
    In 1842-43    he delivered lectures at the College of Surgeons, in which
he enunciated his views on various important physiological and pathological
processes, which were subsequently incorporated, along with some obser
vations by his brother Harry, in an octave volume published in 1845.          In
these lectures he contended that the nucleus of the cell was a persistent
element of the textures, that it existed even within the bone-corpus
cles, that it played a most important part in the nutrition of the textures,
and that great multiplication of the nuclei occurred in disease of cartilage,
bone, and other tissues.
    In 1844 he was appointed Demonstrator of Anatomy in the University
to Dr. Monro tertius, and on the resignation of that gentleman in 1846 he
succeeded him in the Chair of Anatomy, an o<U+FB01>ice which he continued to
hold until his death.      In  the same year he communicated     to the Philoso
phical    Transactions   a  Memoir on the Development        of the Suprarenal,
Thymus, and Thyroid          Glands,  and was elected a    Fellow of the Royal
Society.
    Mr.  Goodsir enjoyed for many years remarkable success as a teacher.
He gathered together      a large number of students, and for several years the
attendance on his class numbered between 300 and 400.           In his Lectures
on Human and Comparative Anatomy he did not satisfy himself with giving
a mere descriptive account of the various structures he was called on to ex‘-.
pound, but he pointed out the relations of his science to physiology, patho
logy, histology, morphology, and development.           It was to this mode of
illustrating the dry details of anatomy, more perhaps than to any special
faculty for exposition, that his success as a teacher was due.       He worked
most assiduously at Comparative Anatomy, and by his labours the collection
in the Anatomical Museum of the University has been very largely increased,
partly by the specimens added during his lifetime, and partly by the pur
chase of his private collection since his decease.     In 1850 be projected and

                                       xvr
 edited the Annals of Anatomy and Physiology ; but as his health shortly
 afterwards began to give way, the journal, after three numbers had been
published, was discontinued.    In 1853 he was obliged to withdraw for a
year from active work; and though after his return from the continent he
resumed the duties of his chair, yet he had to depute much of the work he
had at one time performed    to an assistant.    He still continued, however,
his original investigations, and in 1856 published a series of memoirs on the
morphology of the skeleton.      The mechanism of the joints also attracted a
large share of his attention, and he has left behind him some manuscript
essays on this subject which will shortly be published in the collected edi
tion of his writings.    The paralytic affection from which he suffered gra
dually impaired the vigour of his constitution.     At the close of 1866 he
could no longer attend to the duties of his class, and he died at Wardie, a
suburb of Edinburgh, on the 6th of March, 1867.        The retired life he had
led for many years before his death gave him much time for private study,
and his extensive knowledge of modern languages, as well as the excellent
library he had collected, made him well acquainted with the progress of
anatomy in all its departments.    He worked at his science in a high-toned,
philosophic, and  most  honourable  spirit; and in his scienti<U+FB01>c and personal
relations he strove to be candid and just to all men.
   WILLIAM     GRAVATT    was   born   at    Gravesend   in   1806.     His   father,
Colonel Gravatt,   having been appointed Inspector of the Royal Military
Academy,   settled with his family at ‘Voolwich; and here William Gravatt
acquired his <U+FB01>rst practical knowledge in military and civil engineering. He
was sent in due time to the establishment of Messrs. Donkin and Co. to be
prepared for his future profession of civil engineer, and soon secured the
good opinion of his masters as well as the regard of his fellow pupils.
 During his engagement with Messrs. Donkin he was employed for some
 time at the Thames Tunnel, and was twice instrumental in saving the lives
 of men who were working there.       His <U+FB01>rst independent employment was
 in 1832, when he was appointed Engineer to the Calder and Hebble Navi
 gation at Halifax.   In 1833 he removed to London, and was elected a Fel
 low of the Royal Society.     About this time he invented the level which
 bears his name, and introduced the system of reading the statf with
 the telescope, instead of trusting to the staff-bearer—a method of working
.which has long superseded all other modes of observation.        Mr. Gravatt
 also contrived another  instrument,  which  he  called a Nadir, of great value
 in carrying out a system of levels in cases when there were obstacles to the
 employment of a regular staff of assistants.     When M. Scheutz~ brought
 over his calculating machine to this country in November 1844, Mr. Gra
vatt announced its arrival to the Royal Society, and took a lively interest
in it. He further undertook to explain the mechanism and operation of the
machine to men of science and others who chose to inspect             it,
                                                                and after
 wards proceeded with the machine       to Paris for the same         purpose.    He

                                            xvii
  also superintended the publication of a volume of Specimen-Tables             calcu
  lated and printed by its agency.        In 1856 Mr. Gravatt read to the Royal
  Society a paper upon the theory of the Gyroscope, which was at that time
  exciting much interest in the scienti<U+FB01>c world.          About the same time he
  published    a short  pamphlet   upon   the propulsion  of  ships by means of a jet
  of  water,  an application  of  power  which   seems now  likely to be brought into
  practical use.
      1\Ir. Gravatt's life was unfortunately terminated on the 30th of May,
  1866, by the accidental administration of an excessive dose of morphia.
     CHARLES James Haacaaavn was born near Leeds in December 1820.
  After leaving his school (Bramham College) he distinguished himself at
  University College, London, and took the degree of LL.B. with honours
 in the University of London.          From 1843 to 1849 he was Professor of
 Jurisprudence      in  University. College.     Having acquired a high reputation
 at the equity bar, he was appointed in 1849 a Commissioner of the Incum
 bered Estates Court in Ireland.         Those who know the nature of the duties
 and the state of things for remedy of which the court was created, will be
 aware that a singular combination of legal knowledge, sound judgment, and
 imperturbable temper was required.           All were found in Mr. Hargreave, as
 was soon seen and acknowledged.            The condition of those who came under
the jurisdiction of his Court was described, we believe by Mr. Hargreave
 himself, in a manner which, all jokes being logical fallacies, has no worse
 fault than the sophism of a part for the whole.           He said that punch was
 no longer known in Galway, only toddy ; for whiskey and sugar could be
 got on credit from Dublin, but lemons required ready money.              Of himself,
 his colleague (Judge Long<U+FB01>eld) wrote as follows :—“ It may be said that
his <U+FB01>rst experience in a court of justice [he had been a conveyancer and
 draughtsman] was to preside in it as judge.           But no person could observe
 any de<U+FB01>ciency.        His patience, his learning, and his impartiality‘quickly re
 ceived the respect and con<U+FB01>dence of the practitioners in his court, and his
unequalled sweetness of temper made him a general favourite. . ~.. . But he
was most in his element when an unusual combination of circumstances and
complicated deeds seemed to produce inextricable confusion.                His habits
of order and his <U+FB01>ne mathematical mind at once arranged the rights of
the parties with a certainty approaching mathematical demonstration.              He
never seemed happier than when he was engaged in a subtle mathematical
analysis, or in determining the rights arising from a deed when every event
occurred except those contemplated by the conveyancer who drew the in
strument.”
     Judge Hargreave (so entitled from 1858, when the court was made per
manent) died at Bray, County Wicklow, April 23, 1866.                    There is no
doubt that his constitution was destroyed by his junction of two severe intel
lectual pursuits     ; and there is too much reason to fear that the excitement

 He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1844. In the ‘ Transactions
for 1848, 1850, 1858 appear his papers on Differential Equations, on
 Linear Equations of Differentials and of Differences, and on the Problem of
Three Bodies, the <U+FB01>rst of which received a Royal Medal. His other com
 munications are to the Philosophical Magazine, 184 7-1864.       One separate
and posthumous work, ‘An Essay on the Resolution of Algebraic Equa
tions,’ 1866, Svo (printed for private circulation), demands notice. This spe
culation especially refers to equations of the <U+FB01>fth degree, or quinties.  Mr.
Hargreave believed himself to have arrived at a solution in the same sense
and manner as the cubic has long been solved.        The solution of the cubic
is not quite pure.     An expression having nine values, or three triplets,
gives in each triplet the three roots of one of three cubics, which only
differ in containing different cube roots of unity.     Mr. Hargreave alleges
that he produces <U+FB01>ve similarly associated quintics,    of which the <U+FB01>ve quin
tuplets of roots can be given in an expression of the 25th degree.        The
complexity of the analysis, compared with that of a quadratic, is pro
bably in even a higher ratio than the complexities of the discriminant;
(p. 9) of a quintic and a quadratic; and there will be very few readers.
The result cannot yet be pronounced upon; but assuredly the thought and
the skill employed will remain the subjects of lasting admiration.
   His old teacher, Mr. De Morgan, informs us that the most remarkable
point, though not the greatest, about Mr. Hargreave was the change in his
handwriting.      From sixteen to eighteen years of age he wrote in a manner
which almost required a microscope to decipher; his examination—papers
put the proof of the binomial theorem into the area of avisiting card.     He
emerged from his legal studies with a round Roman hand of more than
average size, and much more than average legibility.
   On the 22nd January, 1867, died at Plymouth Sm WILLIAM Snow
HARRIS, Kt., in his seventy-<U+FB01>fth year. He was the only son of Thomas
Harris of Plymouth, Solicitor, whose family had settled in that town as
early as the year 1600.      He was educated <U+FB01>rst at the Grammar School at
Plymouth, after which he entered the medical profession, and completed
his studies in Edinburgh.        Harris commenced the practice of his pro
fession as a militia surgeon, and afterwards became a general practitioner
in Plymouth; but his love of science, especially of electricity, interfered
with his practice.
   In 1820 he invented a system of lightning-conductors,         by which he
became more generally known than by his discoveries.         This system had
reference chie<U+FB02>y to the defence of the Royal Navy from the destructive
effects of lightning, and its peculiarity consisted in permanently <U+FB01>xing
suf<U+FB01>ciently massive copper bands in the masts, and in leading these copper
lines along the ship’s timbers to the copper sheathing, so as to afford the

                                      xix
  required security at all times, and under all the variable circumstances in
  which the ship might be placed.
     In 1824 Harris married the eldest daughter of Richard Thorne, Esq.,
 of Pilton, North Devon, and from this time he chie<U+FB02>y devoted himself to
 the cultivation of electrical science. The earlier results of his study at this
 period were for the most part laid before the Royal Society of Edinburgh
 in a series of papers, the <U+FB01>rst of which, entitled “Experimental Inqui—
 ries concerning the Laws of Magnetic Forces,” appeared in the ‘ Trans
 actions’ in 1829; but the paper is dated Plymouth, July 1, 1827.             It
 contains an account of the hydrostatic        magnetometer.       The   second
 paper, “On a new Electrometer, and the heat excited in metallic bodies
 by Voltaic Electricity,” is dated May 5th, 1831.      The third paper, dated
 April 5th, 1833, is “On the Investigation of Magnetic Intensity by the
 Oscillations of the Horizontal Needle.”    By this time the author had been
 elected a Fellow of both the London and Edinburgh Royal Societies.
    The bent of Harris’s mind for improving and constructing electrical
instruments is shown at this early period.    Indeed his connexion with the
Royal Society was in a great measure due to this cause. The President,
Sir Humphry Davy, having been attracted by his electrical thermometer,
invited him to give an account of it to the Society, which he did in 1826 ;
and his <U+FB01>rst paper appeared in the PhilosophicalTransactions          under   the
following title: “On the relative powers of various metallic substances
as conductors of Electricity.”
   Harris’s researches on some of the elementary laws of electricity ap
peared in the Philosophical Transactions in 1834, 1836, and 1839, and
they display in a striking manner the author’s ingenuity and delicate mani
pulative skill.   He was not satis<U+FB01>ed with the attainment of his end by
any means, but the means themselves were the subject of long and patient
thought and repeated trials, until the best means possible under the cir
cumstances had been hit upon.      This care in the selection and improve
ment of apparatus might seem to an ordinary observer to he often super
fluous, but it led to success, and to the thorough understanding of the
conditions of success; so that the ultimate failure of an experiment in
Harris’s hands became next to impossible.     But with all this love of ap
paratus, and of its minute details, Harris had none of the spirit of a mere
mechanical artist; he knew that the best instrument does the best work
only under the guidance of the best mind.     But Harris’s ingenuity was by
no means con<U+FB01>ned to his apparatus.      There was not a room in his house,
from the attic to the kitchen, that did not bear marks of an original mind.
He converted the ceiling of his children's nursery into a planetarium, and
the <U+FB02>oor into a compass card. He did not disdain to invent a child’s toy,
or to rectify a defect in his ingenious kitchen range.
   In 1835 the Copley Medal, the “ olive crown ” 0f the Royal Society, as
Davy loved to call   it, was bestowed on Harris in recognition of the value
of his papers on the laws of electricity     of high tension.    In   1839 his
                                                                c

 “Inquiries concerning the Elementary Laws of Electricity               formed the
subject of the Bakerian Lecture.
    In the midst of these researches concerning the general doctrines of
electricity, Harris had never ceased to labour at the practical question of
the protection of ships from lightning. Erroneous views on the subject were
 then common       ; highly educated men and naval of<U+FB01>cers were found to
af<U+FB01>rm    that lightning-conductors did more harm than good; that they
attracted lighting to the structure they were intended to protect, and more
to the like effect.     A mixed commission of naval and scienti<U+FB01>c men was at
length appointed by Government to take the whole subject under review.
The committee met several times in the rooms of the Royal Society at Somer
set House, and Harris was called upon to give his evidence.         Dr. Wollaston
took great interest in the inquiry, and was present during Harris’s experi
ments, which were so satisfactory that the committee earnestly recom
mended     his system for general adoption in the Royal Navy.             Still, how
ever, he had much opposition         to contend with.    Trial had been made of
his conductors in the      case of ten ships sent to various parts of the world,
and experience had fully proved their value, yet an order was given (or
threatened) for the removal of the conductors from each ship as soon as
it came into dock.        But in the mean time the protective effects of his
system were so strikingly exhibited on shore, that the order above referred
to was never carried out.        Some granite chimneys in the victnalling-yard
at Devonport were in the course of being <U+FB01>tted with the conductors.                In
the case of one chimney the <U+FB01>ttings were completed, in the other the
work was delayed in consequence of some adverse order.             A storm passed
over Plymouth, the protected chimney was unhurt, the unprotected one
was struck and rent asunder.
    Harris's conductors now began to <U+FB01>nd favour at the Admiralty, and the
scienti<U+FB01>c    discoveries of their inventor were at length recognized in the
same quarter, so that he was recommended to the Government as worthy
of an annuity of £300 “in consideration of services in the cultivation of
science."      Prejudices   against his system, however, lingered     in the minds
of naval men and others, and in order to remove them Harris published
in 1843 his well-known work on ‘ Thunder Storms.’            IIc endeavoured also,
in papers in the Nautical Magazine and in separate pamphlets, to spread in
formation    concerning damage by lightning.        Hc was always on the watch
for an illustrative example, and once he got the trace, never gave it up until
he had tracked it to the ship’s log deposited in Somerset House, or obtained
an account from the captain or one       of the of<U+FB01>cers of the ship that had been
struck.     Accounts of such casees, in the form of letters or pamphlets,
be caused to be circulated among persons in authority,              including the
various foreign ambassadors ; and it may be mentioned that Harris’s
system was adopted in the Russian Navy before it was fully admitted into
our own. In 1845 the Emperor presented Harris with a valuable ring and
a superb vase, in acknowledgment of the merits of his system.

                                               xxi
       At length all dif<U+FB01>culties in the way of his long-cherished object were
   overcome.      The various objections to his conductors had been met, the
   merits of his system were clearly understood, and its adoption in the
                                                                                   Royal
   Navy was secured.          It was then also felt that some further public recogni'
   tion was due of the bene<U+FB01>t thus conferred on the Naval force and mari
   time industry of this country and the world.              Accordingly, in 1847 the
   honour    of knighthood was conferred upon him, and soon afterwards a
   grant of £5000 was made to him by Government, in consideration of his
   public services.     In 1850110 was elected an Honorary Member of the Naval
   Club at Plymouth, and in 1854 of the Royal Yacht Club at Cowes, as an
   especial acknowledgment of his services to the Royal Navy.                   Nothing
   could be more congenial to his tastes, for he was always more of a. sailor
  than a landsman.          He had a yacht of his own, and was never tired of
  exercising it; but he loved to be on the sea in whatever craft.
      In the midst of his multiplied engagements Sir \Villiam did not forget
  the claims of elementary instruction          in science.    The Manuals     of Elec
  tricity, bIagnetism, and Galvanism            published  in Weale’s   “
                                                                          Rudimentary
  Series,” and which had a large sale, testify to the activity of his mind in
  this direction.
      Harris’s    sympathies      were with the Bennetts, the Cavendishes, the
  Singers,  the   Voltas   of  a past age;    Frictional electricity was his forte, and
  the source    of  his triumphs.      He was be‘wildered and dazzled by the elec
 trical development of the present day, and almost shut his             eyes to it. He
 was    attached too closely and exclusively to the old school of science to
 recognize the broad and sweeping advance of the new.                 He was not con
 scious even of being behind his age when he presented to the Royal Society
 in 1861 an elaborate paper on an improved form of Bennett’s discharger,
 and still less in 1864, when he discussed the laws of electrical distribu
 tion, and still relied upon the Leydcn         jar and the unit-jar.
     Although Sir W. Harris’s powers as a scienti<U+FB01>c inquircr cannot be
 reckoned as on a par with those of some of his great contemporaries, he
 was highly ingenious           and inventive, a clear thinker, and a suggestive
 writer. He did his work well, and left his mark on the science of his
 day; and while some ofhis labours will be forgotten and others be ab
sorbed and blended with the branch of physical science that he cultivated,
still there are many points in Harris’s character as a man, and in his
habits as a philosopher, which will be dwelt on with pleasure and pro<U+FB01>t.
     In August 1861, on returning from an excursion in his yacht, Sir Wil
liam was seized with a painful disease of the eyes (iritz's), which did not
yield to medical treatment during some months.                He was con<U+FB01>ned to the
house     until  the following May.        In  the  autumn   of  1862, in consequence
of a return of the malady, he underwent two painful operations; but the
result eventually was, that he lost the sight of one eye, and found the
vision of the other much impaired, and his general health weakened.
     Recovering,    however, in some       measure, from this trying illness, he be

                                        xxii
 came most anxious to complete a work the materials for which had been
 accumulating    during a series of years. This was a complete Treatise on
 Frictional Electricity, to which he intended to add biographical notices of
 the leading electricians of the past.     He had also prepared a minute ac
 count of the history of the Leyden jar. The <U+FB01>rst portion of this work was
 completed, under the supervision of the author, at the close of 1866, when
 Sir \Villiam was seized with his last illness, which ended fatally on the
 evening of the 22nd January 1867.         He bore his sad calamity during <U+FB01>ve
years and ahalf with the greatest patience, calmness, and fortitude, and was
 never heard to murmur.
    Dr. WILLIAM HENRY HARVEY was born near Limerick, on February 5,
 1814.     Educated at Ballitore School, Kildare, his youth was spent in his
father’s of<U+FB01>ce at Limerick; but a love of natural history very early deve
 loped itself, and even while engaged in business he found time to pursue
botanical studies with ardour and success, contributing in 1832 and 1834
                        ” to Sir \Villiam
 articles on “ Algae                         Hooker’s ‘ British Flora,’ to the
 '                                                    ‘
   Botany of Beechey’s Voyage,’ and to Mackay’s Flora Hibernica.’
    His scienti<U+FB01>c zeal led him in 1835 to accompany his brother to the
 Cape of Good Hope, to which colony the latter had been appointed Trea
 surer and Registrar-General.       The results of his botanical studies during
his stay there    he  embodied  in  numerous   contributions to periodical litera
                    ‘
ture, and in his Genera of South African Plants,’ a work the second edi—
tion of which was nearly ready at the time of his death.         He came home
from the Cape in 1839, but returned again in the following year to <U+FB01>ll the
place of his brother, who had died on the voyage home.
    In 1844 he returned to Ireland upon being appointed Keeper of the Her
barium to the University of Dublin.        He also received the honorary degree
of MD. of that University, and was soon after elected Professor of Botany
to the Royal Dublin Society.        His botanical zeal and energy manifested
itself by the  commencement,     in  1845, of the publication of his ‘ Phycologia
Britannica,’ a magni<U+FB01>cent work, the numerous plates of which were drawn,
lithographed, and coloured by himself.
    Upon the occasion of being invited       to delivera course of lectures on
Algae before the Lowell Institute, Boston,         U.S., he travelled in North
America during 1849—50, carefully         exploring the coast from Halifax to
the Keys of Florida, and collecting material for a large work, the ‘ Nereis
Boreali-Americana,’      which was published by the Smithsonian Institute.
During 1853-56 he made a long tour in the Southern Hemisphere, the
University of Dublin continuing to grant him his full salary, and Professor
Allman delivering his lectures to the Royal Dublin Society.               Visiting
Ceylon, Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, the Friendly and the Fiji
Islands,   he investigated and collected the alga: of these countries, and on
his return home published      a part of his results in his ‘Phycologia Aus
tralis.’

   In 1859 be commenced, in conjunction with Dr. Sender and with the
assistance of the Cape Government, a complete description of the <U+FB02>owering
                                                     “ Flora
plants and ferns of South Africa, in a work entitled         Capensis,” the
chief share in the labour of which fell to Dr. Harvey. As a companion
  to this he also commenced a series of illustrations under the title “Thesaurus
  Capensis.” - Neither of these works did he live to see completed.
_    In 1856, the Chair of Botany in the University of Dublin becoming va—
cant through the removal of Professor Allman to Edinburgh, Harvey was
chosen to <U+FB01>ll         it,
               and about the same time he was appointed lecturer at the
Irish   Museum         of Industry.
   Unhappily his unceasing labours began to tell upon his health; and
though he recovered from      severe illness which prostrated him in 1861,
                                      a
his condition in 1864 became so alarming that he was obliged to pass the
following winter and spring in the south of France.   The improvement he
experienced there was, however, but temporary;   and after another winter
spent at Dublin in painful attempts to <U+FB01>nish the works he had begun, he
removed toTorquay, where he died, 1\Iay 15, 1866.
   He       was                           receive the full acknowledgment
                  thus cut off before he could
ofhis  many  services to science. He  had,  however, achieved     great repu
                                                                          a
tation as botanist, and on his own especial subject of Algae he was admitted
              a
to be the <U+FB01>rst authority. He was an accurate and careful observer; the
numerous illustrations,all drawn and lithographed, and many coloured, by
his own hand, are evidence that he spared no pains to make his works
trustworthy and sure, while the personal expense and risk to which he ex—
posed himself both in his exploring expeditions and in his literary under
takings, testify to his devotion to science. He was as modest as he was
meritorious, and his personal character endeared him greatly to his friends.
His election to the Royal Society         is   dated June   3,   1864.
   Paacrvar. Noa'row JOHNSON died on the 1st of June, 1866, aged 73.
He was the only son of John Johnson, at one time the only commercial
assayer in London; and after working with his father for some years, he
established himself in Hatton Garden half     century ago.
                                                      a
   He rapidly rose to the highest eminence as an assayer and metallurgist;
and his opinion was so much sought after that he could hardly get through
the work which crowded upon him.
   It not little remarkable that the extreme accuracy of his assays was
        is        a
made    aground of objection to them.     He for the <U+FB01>rst time reported the
exact amount of gold and silver in the specimens submitted, whereas, before,
the   quantities had only been stated approximately         and this was not
                                                                   ;
relished by the buyers of bullion, inasmuch as contingent advantages in buy
ing upon exactly known value were not so great. Upon this being represented
to him     the merchants, he at once stated that he was willing,
             by                                                   required, to
                                                                         if
purchase all bars upon his own assays          ;   and this was the reason of his taking

                                        xxiv
up the re<U+FB01>ning business, in which he so largely and successfully engaged.
His ability in this (as in all other branches that he entered upon) was soon
                                                                  “
recognized publicly ; and when the gold bars from the Brazilian     Gongo
Soco” mines, which came over in very large quantities, were refused at the
Mint on account of brittleness, he was consulted on the matter, and under
took to re<U+FB01>ne and toughen them, in which be perfectly succeeded.
   It was in this gold that he discovered the existence of palladium ; and
having succeeded in its separation, he introduced it commercially, at once
determining and making known the best uses to which it could be applied.
  After he had been in business some years he visited Germany, and was
much interested in mining operations there, to which he gave special atten
tion.  It was at this time that he met with the compound alloy called
“ German silver,” then in a very crude state of manufacture. He brought
over with him some of the metal, analyzed       it,
                                                and upon the basis of his
analysis he commenced and carried on its manufacture, and introduced              it
to general use, laying the foundation of the enormous business which has
since arisen in this branch of metallurgy.
   About this time he was much engaged in mining pursuits, and was con
sulted upon, and visited professionally, nearly all the mines in England.
Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, and many important ones abroad. He was the
<U+FB01>rst to introduce into Cornwall the German shaking, jigging-, and washing
table, with important improvements of his own.   He will always be remem
bered throughout the mining districts for his great kindness and considera
tion toward the miners, whose social condition     was his constant aim to
                                                  it
improve.  At great expense to himself, he erected schools in the neigh
bourhood of the mines, and took an active part in their supervision. He
also used his utmost  endeavours to alleviate the toil of the workmen in
ascending and descending mines, and with this view he, at the Tamar
mines, made the experiment of    sloping gallery, which ran for
                                    a                            consider
                                                                  a
able distance under the river, by which means the miners could walk up
and down without the use of     a   ladder.
   Amongst his many inventions of less note may be mentioned several pot
                                  “
tery colours, amongst them the      rose-pink,” at time when that colour
                                                       a
was much wanted in the potteries.
   His greatest success, however, and that which has proved the most
valuable to the progress of chemistry and manufacture generally, was the
platinum business.   To him undoubtedly belongs the credit of having been
the <U+FB01>rst who successfully re<U+FB01>ned and‘manufactured      platinum upon    com
                                                                         a
mercial  scale, and introduced  it for the important purposes  to which      it   is
specially adapted.    The <U+FB01>rst large and perfect sheet of pure platinum ever
produced was made by        Mr. Johnson   at 79 Hutton Garden; and, seeing
the immense importance        of the metal, he ever since made    his spe
                                                                  it
ciality.
    His    eminence as an analyst should also be noticed; so great was   it,   that

                                           XXV
the only other commercial assayers in London, though his rivals, used to
send him all compounds or minerals of a dif<U+FB01>cult and complicated nature
to report upon for them.
   Accomplished as he was in his department,           and singularly successful in
perfecting whatever he undertook, his opinion          was always sought for with
earnestness and received with con<U+FB01>dence.             Few men have worked more
perseveringly     and effectively for the improvement of their profession.
   Mr. Johnson        was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on April 30,
 1846.
   The life of Sir WILLIAM LAWRENCE, Bart., closed on the 5th of last
July.      He had nearly completed his 84th year. Not more than two years
before his death he resigned his active duties at St. Bartholomew’s Hos
pital, but even then he did not cease from work, and was attacked with
apoplcxy just previous to an examination at the College of Surgeons.
   Lawrence, the son of a surgeon, was born on the 16th of July, 1783, at
Cirencester, in Gloucestershire.         After receiving a preliminary education
at  a  private  school,    in his  seventeenth year he came to London, and was
apprenticed to Abernethy, in whose house he resided for <U+FB01>ve years.             But
at the expiration of three years, being then only twenty, he was appointed
Demonstrator of Anatomy at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital. He discharged
the duties of this office with remarkable ability for twelve years.          When
twenty-two, he received the diploma of the Royal College of Surgeons.
Eight years afterwards he was appointed Assistant-surgeon to St. Bartho
lomew’s Hospital, and eleven years later still he became one of the principal
surgeons.      He held this o<U+FB01>ice for more than forty years, and when he
retiredin 1865, he was unanimously elected by the Governors to the com—
plimentary oliice of Consulting Surgeon.           Thus from <U+FB01>rst to last he was
connected with the hospital for sixty-eight years.
   It is well known that at the early period of his life he worked very hard
without interruption, as indeed he did almost to the last.            Besides dis—
charging his public duties with rare ef<U+FB01>ciency, he read very much and
wrote too.     At eighteen years of age he published an anonymous transla
tion of a Latin work—Description of the arteries of the human body, by
 Dr. Ad. Murray, Professor at the University of Upsal. In his twenty
sixth year he obtained the Jacksonian Prize for an essay on Hernia. This
was the foundation of his important book on the subject, which went
 through <U+FB01>ve editions.          Lawrence on Rupturcs has been for many years
 past,  and  will  be  for  many years to come, a standard work on the subject
 of which it treats.        It is remarkable, not only for the thoroughly good
 English in which it is written, and for clearness and justness of thought,
but for the mastery of the subject which it exhibits, and for widely ex
tended and accurate research.
    In  the year he obtained the Jacksonian prize, he published a translation
of Blumenbach’s Comparative Anatomy.               About the same time appeared

                                       xxvi
 his paper on Fungus of the Testis.       The novel plan of treatment therein
 proposed was generally accepted and adopted for many years.
     In 1814 he was appointed Surgeon to the London In<U+FB01>rmary for Diseases
 of the Eye, now called the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital, and in the
 following year surgeon to the Royal Hospitals of Bethlehem and Bridewell.
 These o<U+FB01>’ices he held for many years.      He devoted a very large share of
 his attention to the study of diseases of the eye, and in 1833, after many
 years of patient observation and re<U+FB02>ection, he produced his celebrated trea
 tise on the subject, having previously (in 1830) published a smaller volume
 on syphilitic diseases of the eye.    A comprehensive work, written with all
 the ability and skill which characterized his work on Hernia, it may be
 said to have marked an epoch in ophthalmic surgery.           It was translated
 into many languages, a portion of it even into     Arabic,   and went through
 many editions     in English.   The last was published     in Philadelphia in
  1854.
     In 1813 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and subsequently
 nominated a Vice-President.      But it does not appear that he ever contri
 buted any paper.
     In 1815 Lawrence was appointed Professor of Anatomy and Surgery to
 the College of Surgeons.      There, during the years 1816, 1817, and 1818,
 he delivered those famous lectures on Comparative Anatomy, Physiology,
 Zoology, and the Natural History of Man, which astonished so many, and
 aroused such animosity, that had their author been a man of less capa
 bility, he would, beyond doubt, have been ruined for life.
    The question at issue between the author and his assailants is not one
 which can be discussed within the limits of this notice.        But it may be
 safely said, that were such a work to appear amongst us now, it would
 evoke no censure beyond that which lies within the bounds of fair scienti<U+FB01>c
 or literary criticism.  The doctrine (if it can be so called) which then
 prevailed concerning   the  nature of Life, and the weakness of which Law
 rence exposed with an unsparing hand, has long since become a dogma
 of the past; and in the discussion of this great question it is only fair
 to state that he was far in advance of his time.       And, again, his view
 of the other chief subject, the relation of mind to brain, which was then
 denounced so <U+FB01>ercely, is (whether right or wrong) identical with that of
many of the most enlightened physiologists of the present day.         In scien
ti<U+FB01>c argument, Lawrence was more than a match for his opponents, but
he was assailed by weapons which have happily been since discarded by
the champions of knowledge.         It may, however, be urged in excuse for
the grievous misrepresentation to which he was subjected, that he was
not always su<U+FB02>iciently careful to guard against being misunderstood, and
proclaimed what he then, and to the last, believed to be the truth, with
disregard of, or indifference to, the convictions of those who were then
looked up to as the leaders of thought.
    In 1816 Lawrence published “An Introduction to Comparative Ana

                                          xxvii
tomy and Physiology, being the two Introductory lectures delivered at the
College of Surgeons on the 21st and 25th of March, 1816;” and in 1819
                 “ Lectures on
he published                      Physiology, Zoolog , and the Natural History
of Man.” This last       was  the  celebrated volume Lawrence was subsequently
induced to suppress; but in 1823, Carlile, without the sanction or consent
 of the author, indeed, in spite of anything he could do to restrain him,
 printed   and  published   a volume, entitled “ Lectures on     Comparative   Ana
 tomy, Physiology, Zoology, and the Natural History of Man,” which
 included and was simply a copy of the two volumes mentioned above.
 Many other editions, variously modi<U+FB01>ed, afterwards appeared.              The last,
 called the 9th, was published by Bohn in 1848.
     Lawrence taught at the Aldersgate School of Medicine          in 1926—27, but
 he retired from this in 1829, when he succeeded Abernethy as Lecturer on
 Surgery at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital.          He occupied this chair for thirty
 three years.
     In  1828 he was elected on the Council of the College of Surgeons, and
 in 1840 one of the Examiners, and subsequently be was twice President
 of   the College.    Moreover,   he became a foreign Associate of the Institute
 of France, and      a member    of  a host of other societies.    Then he was ap
 pointed, at <U+FB01>rst, Surgeon Extraordinary, and afterwards Sergeant-surgeon
  to the Queen.      Finally, he received a title.
     Besides the works already mentioned, Lawrence wrote much.              He con
  tributed no less than eighteen papers to the Transactions of the Medical
  and Chirurgical Society, of which he was for many years a member, and,
  at one time, President.      He wrote many of the articles on Natural Science,
  some of them at a short notice, in“ Rees’s Cyclopasdia.”               IIe contri
  buted also to a work of Watt, entitled “Anatomico-chirurgical Views of
  the Nose, Month, Larynx, and Fauces.”
     In 1863 (he was then in his eightieth year) was published his last
  work, “Lectures on Surgery.” This, in one volume, by no means em
  braces the whole course, but only that part of it which was devoted to
  what may be called the more general subjects, such as the nature of dis
  ease, in<U+FB02>ammation     and its consequences, fever, wounds, and speci<U+FB01>c dis
                                                                                     i
  eases.    This charming book appeared perhaps somewhat after its time ; at
  all events, it would have produced          more effect had its able and accom
  plished author consented to numerous pressing solicitations to undertake
  the task—the materials being ready to his hand—many years before. But
  as it is, better late than never.      It is enough to say of it that therein are
   embodied the most matured experience of the author, and the conclusions
  at which he had arrived or the opinions he had formed on some of the
  largest questions which arise in surgery ; and moreover it is written with
   such soundness ofjudgment and felicity of expression, that it is not only
  a highly instructive, but a very attractive volume.           It is the work not
   only of a surgeon, but of a scholar.
      On two instances Lawrence delivered the Hunterian oration           at the Col

                                       xxviii
 lege of Surgeons.   On the last, when the great majority of those whom he
 addressed were hostile to the views he set forth, his power of public speak
ing was subjected to a test to which perhaps few men would have proved
equal.   For the second time in his life did he on a great occasion arouse
the anger of his auditory, and excite against himself bitter feeling of resent
ment.    The opinions he expressed on certain questions which were then
agitating the minds of many in the profession, and the contempt with
which he spoke of certain existing institutions, called forth from all parts
of the theatre loud expressions of dissent and denunciation.         Probably
most of those present thought that the orator would shrink from so un
equal an encounter, and bow to the verdict which was so unequivocally
pronounced.  But Lawrence never for an instant wavered from his pur
pose.   He, standing alone, calm and unshaken by the storm which raged
around him, proceeded in a strain of unfalteriug eloquence to the end, and
concluded with a peroration of such power and beauty that those who
had, during the hour, been loud in condemnation, could not resist joining
heartin in the burst of applause which greeted the close. Undoubtedly he
then exhibited some of the greatest qualities of an orator.
  Lawrence      was indeed richly endowed by nature, and he spared no
pains to  turn  his great advantages to good account.        Throughout his long
life he enjoyed almost uninterrupted health ; for within not many months
of his death, he declared that he had never been kept from his duties by ill
ness for a week together.      His excellent health, notwithstanding hard work,
continued through      so many years with scarcely any intermission, although
no doubt originally the result of an unblemished constitution, was yet, from
<U+FB01>rst to last, carefully preserved by habits of singular regularity and uniform
temperance in all things.        No man could be less self-indulgent than he,
no one was    ever more   orderly in his work or punctual to his engagements.
In person too he was much admired. Above the ordinary height, elegant
in form, strikingly handsome, and of noble presence, few who met him could
have failed to be impressed.        But Lawrence was still more remarkable for
his powers   of mind.     His intellect, naturally of extraordinary strength and
amplitude, had been very long and most industrioust cultivated. Through
out his life, from the time when he <U+FB01>rst entered the hospital to its close,
he was a diligent student, not of surgery only, in its highest and widest
sense, and of those natural sciences upon which it is more immediately
founded, but even of subjects less akin than those are to that which formed
the business of his life.
   Apart from all professional knowledge and skill, Lawrence was undoubt
edly an accomplished man.      He was a good classical scholar, and spoke
fluently French,  German,   and  Italian. His knowledge of history, both
ancient and modern, was extensive, and in some parts perhaps profound.
To the last he was true to the habit of his whole life. He not only read
very much, and remembered to an extraordinary degree what he read, but
thoroughly digested   it,   separating with remarkable   skill the wheat from

                                              xxix
the cha<U+FB01>'.       But beyond the more immediate occupation of his life—sur
gery, his chief affection was centred in those sciences which are included
in Biology.         He was not content to cultivate these sciences only, so far
as they are supposed to be directly            applicable to practice, but, from <U+FB01>rst
to last, he pursued them for the charms they possessed.                   The zeal with
which he studied, especially          in  early life, anatomy and physiology, human
and comparative, is well known.               Throughout his long career his interest
in these subjects never <U+FB02>agged.
     Again, it is acknowledged by those most competent to judge, that he
wrote well.        His style was excellent—correct, perspicuous, and graceful.
 He spoke, too, admirably.             \Vhether in private or in public, he never ap
peared at a loss either for thought or expression, but was always lucid and
to the point.        From egotism and all a<U+FB01>'ectation he was supremely free.
     Although      he  was very fond in his later years of discussing with his
 friends any     of  the   great questions of physiology, it does not appear that
 he ever committed his thoughts to writing.               But those who listened with
 delight to his conversation were often led to regret that he was never
induced to set forth his views in a more permanent form.                      There was
 something very         attractive   in  the power    of mind and range of knowledge
 which he, on almost all occasions, seemed to hold in reserve. But two
 facts especially impressed themselves on those who talked with him.                  He
 was always thoronghly well read in the subject,'_and his views, unfettered
 by prejudice, were ample and enlightened.
     As  a surgeon, Lawrence        was distinguished rather by his clear and vigo
 rous conception         of principles than by any special or peculiar skill in the
 details of practice.        His was no low or narrow view of the requirements of
 surgery;     its  practice in his hands was no mere empirical or mechanical
 art, but he thought it worthy of the highest powers of the intellect.                He
 was no mere skilled artisan,'lbut a thorough philosopher.              His great ability
 was never more conspicuous than in prognosis.                At times, with marvellous
  dexterity, he would predict the issue of a case which battled or misled every
 one around him.          Thus his most daring achievements as an Operator were
  often crowned with success, which to others appeared in the distance as
 the remotest chance.
     As an operator, he was decidedly skilful ; but his skill was shown not
 so much in grace         of action or in apparent manual dexterity} as in the
 ability with which he accomplished the end in view, and the manner in
  which he brought the operation to a close.                 Near-sighted in early life,
 his vision in his declining years, except towards the end, not only did not
  fail, but in some respects improved.               To the last he operated without
  glasses,  and   those   which   for  some  years  he  occasionally used at other times,
  still later he almost entirely laid aside.
      All his colleagues and pupils, and many others, were familiar with his
  amazing coolness and perfect self-possession under the greatest dif<U+FB01>culties.
  He seemed never to be disturbed, even by the most perplexing and unto—

                                      XXX
ward occurrence.      Beyond the faintest blush which, perhaps, now        and
then for a moment passed over his countenance, no indication of            any
kind appeared that he was in the least degree affected. This wonderful
equanimity made him the same at all times and under every circumstance.
Vl’hatever he may have occasionally felt was known only to himself.         So
far as observation went, the worst di<U+FB02>iculties of an operation, or the
storm of an indignant assembly, alike failed to evoke any evidence of
emotion.
   In the memoir of Sir Benjamin Brodie, which appeared in the Proceed
ings of the Society, it was truly said, “There is no profession where a
man may in his lifetime be so distinguished,     and leave behind so slight a
record of his life, as the profession  of Medicine or of Surgery.    With the
death of the man, there pcrishes in such case a vast amount of personal
 skill and observation, which, being unwritten, and, indeed, not capable of
being written, can be amassed again only by the combination of similar
talent, opportunity, and industry in another individual.”        Lawrence was
an eminent illustration of this.    Great and various as the merits are of the
chief of his published    works, they afford no adequate conception of their
author.     Lawrence,  too, Was greater in speech than in writing: as a leo
turer, in his best days, he was probably without a rival ; and those who
knew him well will endorse the opinion of Sir Benjamin Brodie, that he
was even greater in ordinary conversation than in public speaking.        But,
in truth, just as now his fame will not rest upon any single brilliant dis
covery, but upon the record of his whole work, so during life he was not
remarkable for one great faculty in particular, but rather for that harmo
nious combination of various powers which made his character so com
plete.    As asurgeon his name must ever be amongst the foremost of those
which adorn the annals of his profession.                          W. S. S.
   JOHN LEE, eldest     son  of John Fiott (a descendant of an old Burgun
dian family), was born April 28th, 1783.        He entered St. John’s College,
Cambridge, and in 1806 was <U+FB01>fth “'rangler, the senior for that year being
Sir Frederick Pollock.      In 1816 he took his degree of LL.D., and was
afterwards elected a Fellow of the College, when, as Travelling Bachelor,
he travelled widely on the Continent and in the East, during which time
 he gathered materials for the interesting collection of antiquities, which
were subsequently arranged at Hartwell.        In 1815 he changed his name
by royal licence from Fiott to Lee, in compliance with his uncle’s will, his
mother having been daughter of William Lee, Esq., of Totteridge Park,
and granddaughter of Sir William Lee, Lord Chief Justice in 1754.
    In 1827 Dr. Lee succeeded to the whole of the family property, and he
 eame Lord of the manors of Hartwell, Stone, and Bishopstonc, and patron
 of the livings of the two places <U+FB01>rst mentioned.        The presentation to
 these livings he afterwards conferred on the Royal Astronomical Society,
 of which he was Treasurer from 1831 to 184.0, and President in 1861—62.

                                        xxxi
    A   few papers on archazological subjects constitute nearly the whole of
 Dr. Lee’s contributions   to literature; but as a patron he excelled, and well
 deserved the designation of “ our science-loving friend,” bestowed on him
 by the late Admiral Smyth.         One of his favourite occupations was the
 increase of the collections     he had brought home from his travels; and
 visitors to the stately mansion of Hartwell will remember the pride with
 which the venerable owner conducted them from room to room, and
 fondly described his various treasures.      His appreciation of antiquities led
.to   his being chosen as Chairman of the Congress of the Archaeological
 Association and two local societies, which met on Bosworth Field in 1862.
    Dr. Lee’s chief claim to scienti<U+FB01>c consideration was the building of an
  observatory in the grounds at Hartwell, where for many years observations
 were carried on, which are of recognized value in astronomical aud meteor
 ological science.    It was there that Admiral Smyth continued his ‘ Cycle,’
 which was afterwards published, in the handsome quarto known as ‘ Spe
 culum Hartwellianum.’       The cost of this and three other works, by the
 same hand, ‘ Descriptive Catalogue of a Cabinet of Roman Imperial large
 Brass Medals,’ ‘ fEdes Hartwelliame,’ containing an account of the scienti<U+FB01>c
 observations there made by different observers, and of the mansion and its
                                      ’
 valuable contents, and ‘ Addenda       to the same, was defrayed by Dr. Lee.
    Dr. Lee was twice married, but died without issue. He was a Member
 of Doctors’ Commons, in which he served the o<U+FB01>ices of Treasurer and
 Librarian, though he never entered actively into the practice of his pro
 fession.   His appointment as Queen's Counsel by Lord Chancellor W'est
 bury in 1864, afforded him high grati<U+FB01>cation.        At the time of his decease
he was the oldest magistrate in Buckinghamshire,        having been named on
the Commission of the Peace in 1819.
    Though somewhat eccentric in manner, Dr. Lee was considerate and
bountiful to those around him. As a master and landlord he was much
respected.     He gave a thousand guineas towards the establishment of the
 Bucks County In<U+FB01>rmary.         He founded the Lee Fund of the Royal Astro
 nomical Society for the relief of widows and children of deceased Fel
lows, and presented to the Society the ‘Lee Circle,’ a valuable astrono
mical instrument.      He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1831,
and at the time of his deceasc, which took place February 25, 1866,
was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, of the Linnean, Geological, the
 Syro-Egyptian, and other learned bodies.
   SAMUEL Rom-"av MAITLAND died January           19, 1866, aged 74. His father
was a merchant, of Scotch extraction,        and in England a Nonconformist.
The son was brought up in his father’s persuasion, and accordingly, though
he was for some time at Cambridge, he could not proceed to a degree. He
was of St. John’s College from October 1808 to February 1910, when he
migrated to Trinity College, where, however, he never went into residence.
He    was called to the bar, practised for a year with good success, and then

                                     xxxii
abandoned the profession.   He soon married, and settled at Taunton, where
his father also settled. He then began the course of reading and collection
of books, which formed the basis of his future career.          In   1821   he took
orders in the Establishment,   and became    the incumbent of a new church at
Gloucester.   This post he resigned in 1830, having in the mean time found
that his vocation lay towards theological writing; he had then published
various controversal tracts on the prophecies.   In 1838 he was appointed
librarianto the Archbishop of Canterbury (Howley), from whom he re—
ceived the degree of D.D.; at the death of that prelate, in 1848, he re
turned to Gloucester, where he passed the rest of his life. From 1838 to
1865 is the period   in which the workswere produced which made him
conspicuous among writers on mediaeval history and theology.
  We need not enumerate Dr. Maitland‘s numerous and multifarious wri
                                           ‘
tings; perhaps the most read is the Dark Ages, a Series of Essays,’ in
indication of the period so called from the common charge of neglect of
literature and 0f the text of the Sacred Scriptures.      He was not a popular
writer; his subjects are too recondite, and his learning too profound.
    But he is one of a class of whose writings it must be said, that wherever
they take they bite.      They are imbued, but not in excess, with a kind of
humour which seems almost their own ; some would describe it as quaint,
but this word alone only distinguishes its class from others; ajournalist
 describes it as “ sly, dry, and shy, but never high.”     It has more likeness
in it to the peculiar humour of Pascal than is seen in any other writer of
our day.     The character of Dr. Maitland’slearning is that of the man who
reads books which he has always by him, as distinguished from that of
the man who knows how to go to the library and <U+FB01>nd by references.             He
had nothing to do with libraries except his own, and that of which he was
for ten years in 1000 possidentis.    Of this library he published a list of the
English works previous to 1600 which are found in     it,  with valuable biogra
phical references.     As well as man of letters, he was
                               a                            a  book-fancier, and
in early life little ofa bibliomaniac.
             a                             His taste for these articles led him,
when he <U+FB01>rst began to collect, to learn to bind them; and the writer of
this notice remembers endeavouring, when     a   boy, to extracta  book lettered
‘
  Maitland’s \Vorks,’ and <U+FB01>nding that he was trying his strength upon one
of the uprights of the bookcase, all of which were hacked and lettered by
the owner.
   Dr. Maitland became   a   Fellow of the Society in 1839. He was for some
years Editor of the ‘British Magazine.’       Cautious in the highest degree
about literary investigation, he wasin by temperament abold schemer. 'Long
before Sir Rowland Hill appeared         the <U+FB01>eld he proposed to the Minister
of the day that the Government should carry letters for nothing; he was
satis<U+FB01>ed that the de<U+FB01>cit would be much more than made up by the impulse
given to trade; and there are presumptions in favour of his view in the
extraordinary tendency upwards of the revenue since the great change in
the Post Of<U+FB01>ce.   In literature he was decidedly of opinion that would be
                                                                      it

amply worth its cost for the Government to pay for the construction of an
index which should give reference to every human name mentioned in every
book, from the invention of printing down to a recent period.
  GEORGE RnNNIs, C.E., was born in the parish of Christchurch, Surrey,
on the 3rd of December, 1791, and died on the 30th of March, 1866, at
his house in Wilton Crescent, London.
   He was the eldest son of the great engineer John Rennie,     and from his
early years was destined for his father’s profession. His school education
was commenced under Dr. Greenlaw, of Isleworth, and continued at St.
Paul’s School under the mastership of Dr. Roberts.      He was then sent to
the University of Edinburgh to pursue his academical studies, and during
two years of his stay enjoyed the great advantage of living in the house of
Mr. Playfair, the accomplished Professor of Natural Philosophy, and author
of the celebrated ‘Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth.’
On his return to London in 1811 he entered on the practical study of en
gineering, and was soon able to assist his father in all the departments of
his profession.
   In 1818, on the recommendation of J’ames Watt and Sir Joseph Banks, he
was appointed to the of<U+FB01>ce, then become vacant, of Inspector of Machinery
and Clerk of the Irons    (i.  or. dies) at the Royal Mint; and during the
eight years  that he held  the  appointment he made himself intimately ac
quainted with the construction and operation of the machinery employed in
coining.   The knowledge thus acquired stood him in good stead when he
was called on, in conjunction with Messrs. Bolton and Watt, to furnish
machinery for the Mints of Calcutta and Bombay, and, at     a later time, for
those of Mexico, Peru, and Lisbon, and when, in the reign of Louis Phi
lippe, he designed similar but more extensive machinery for the Paris Mint.
   On the death of his father he entered into partnership with his younger
brother, now Sir John Rennie, and went through     a  long and active profes
sional career, during which the brothers were engaged in designing and
executing many engineering works of great magnitude and importance, at
home and abroad.     Among these may be mentioned various national har
bours and docks and their subsidiary machinery ;  extensive drainage works    ;
railway surveys and constructions, and as specially worthy of note, the <U+FB01>rst
surveys of the present line of the Liverpool and Manchester railway, boldly
and successfully carried by the Messrs. Rennie’s advice over the Chat Moss,
and the Namur and Liege, and Mons and Menage lines, planned and exe
cuted by them in Belgium; also bridges-in various parts.     London Bridge
was erected after design made
                a               by George Rennie, which had been approved
by his father; but in consequence of his then holding government appoint
                                                       a
ment his brother was appointed engineer to carry the work into execution.
The Bridge over the Dec at Chester, with an arch of 200 feet span,       is   a
monument of Mr. George Rennie’s skill in this species of construction.   The
original design of this great stone arch was  byMr. Harrison,   awell-known
   von. xvr.                                                     d

                                through    age and
it,the whole plan was remodelled and rendered practicable, and the arch
equilibrated with great scienti<U+FB01>c precision by Mr. Rennie, who further
showed his constructive power by devising                      a   very ingenious centre for sup
porting the arch during the process of building.
   Mr. Rennie took much interest in the question of propelling vessels by
the screw.   The screw-propeller had been already tried at various periods
and in various forms.    Mr. Rennie’s attention was specially drawn to the
subject in 1836, by certain successful trials then made by Mr. Pettit Smith
with screw-propeller <U+FB01>tted to
         a                          small open boat.

tion of the results of this experiment, Mr. Rennie was satis<U+FB01>ed that the
method        would            and advantageous when applied on
                           be practicable                            larger                 a
scale,          that he and his brother, at no small pecuniary risk, com
            insomuch
bined with some other enterprising persons to carry     into effect, and    it                      a
vessel  called the ‘Archimedes was built for the purpose, and <U+FB01>tted with a

dictions, the ‘Archimedes’ succeeded perfectly; and the Messrs. Rennie
subsequently, in 1840, constructed for the Admiralty an iron vessel of 210
tons and <U+FB01>tted    with   screw-propeller, by which
                          it          a              speed was obtained of
                                                                        a

   Throughout his busy practical life Mr. Rennie bestowed much time and
thought on the scienti<U+FB01>c side of his profession, and undertook various ex
perimental inquiries on physical questions connected with it. Three papers
containing the results of some of his investigations are published in the
Philosophical Transactions, viz. “On the Strength of Materials,” in 1818                            ;
“ On the Friction and Abrasion of the Surfaces of Solids,” in 1820 and                          ;
“ On the Friction of Fluids,” in 1831. To the British Association for the
Advancement of Science he made two communications on the Quantity of
Heat developed by Water when rapidly agitated, and presented to the same
body an elaborate Report on the progress of Hydraulics as      branch of En      a
gineering, published in the volumes for 1833 and 1834; also Reports on
Railway Constants (1838), and on the Changes in the Channels of the

he was nominated                a   Vice-President,     and appointed     Treasurer   in succession
to the late Sir           J. W.     Lubbock, which of<U+FB01>ce he held till 1850.            He   was also
a   member of several foreign academies.

   Mr. Rennie married, in 1828,          Margaret Anne, daughter of the late Sir
John Jackson, Bart., M.P., by            whom he has left issue two sons and a
daughter.     Some time before his death he met with a severe accident, from
the effects of which he never recovered.
   Mr.   Rennie was a man of gentle nature and quiet demeanonr, in private
as well as in   public life greatly esteemed and respected.
    HENRY DARWIN         ROGERS was born         in Philadelphia in 1809.    At  the
age  of twenty-one     he was appointed Professor of Chemistry in Dickinson
College, Carlisle,   Pennsylvania, and afterwards to the Chair of Geology in
the University of Pennsylvania.           Then followed his superintendencc of the
GcOlogical Survey     of  the  State  of New   Jersey, residence at Boston, voyages
to Europe, and (in 1857) acceptance of the Professorship of Natural
History and Geology in the University of Glasgow,              in which honourable
post he died in May 1866.
    Prof. Rogers published his Report on the Geology of New Jersey in 1835 :
a year later he was intrusted       with the important task of investigating and
rectifying the geology of the great State of Pennsylvania, in which he spent
several years of earnest labour.         His brother, Prof. \V. D. Rogers, was at
the same time employed in the preliminary survey of Virginia, whereby some
of the most important problems in American geology—the structure of the
Appalachian mountain-chain, and, indeed, of half the continent of North
America—were simultaneously worked out by two of the ablest observers of
the day.      The results of this survey, discussed in a joint Report, were
communicated to the Meeting of the American Association of Geologists
and Naturalists held at Boston in the summer of 1842, “with an elo
quence and fascination of style never surpassed.”                It placed the two
 brothers in an eminent position, recognized by the geologists of the
world.
    The anticipations formed on this occasion were fully con<U+FB01>rmed by the
 <U+FB01>nal Report on the Geology of Pennsylvania, which was published at Edin
burgh, with maps and sections, in [858.              To ensure the bringing out of
this valuable work in         a style   commensurate with its importance, Prof.
 Rogers came to England,        and, while residing in Edinburgh, made intimate
 acquaintance with many men of mark in the literature and science of
 Scotland.     In society, and as a lecturer, his great and varied knowledge
 gave  him   an advantage which        he exercised with graceful facility, and on
 favourite  topics   he would     at times surprise    and charm his hearers by
 bursts of eloquence.
    Besides the works        above mentioned, Prof. Rogers wrote papers and
 reports,  which  were   published in the Reports of the American and of the
 British Association for the Advancement of Science, the Transactions of
 the American Philosophical Society, the Journal of the Boston Society of
 Natural History, in Silliman’s Journal, the Edinburgh Philosophical
 Journal, and the Proceedings of the Geological Society.             The long list of
                                                                       (Z 2

subjects therein contained may be regarded as a memorial honourable alike
to the author and to American science.
    For a few years prior to his decease, Prof. Rogers was one of the
editors of the Edinburgh Journal above referred to.               His health being
delicate, he spent his last winter in Boston, in company with his brother,
and returned      to Scotland   but a short     time before his death.     He was
elected a   Fellow of the Royal Society in 1858.
     WILLIAM     PARSONS, third EARL      or Rossr-z, was born at   York, June  1 7,
 1800, of a family which had been settled in Ireland from the time of
 Elizabeth, many of whom were distinguished in arms, at the bar, and in
 the  Irish House of Commons.         His  father was one of the most eloquent
 persons of his day, and was       the author     of some works of value. Lord
 Rosse was educated at home by a private tutor, and when 18 years old en
 tered Trinity College, Dublin.       His career there was very successful both
 in science and classics, for he obtained all honours that were Possible. He
 did not graduate there, though he answered for the degree ; but in com
 pliance with his father’s wish went to Oxford, where he entered Magdalen
 College.    At that time Oxford was far behind Cambridge in the cultivation
 of mathematical and physical science (to which he had now devoted him
 self), and he seems to have regretted this, though, no doubt, he did avail
 himself well of the instruction which he found.            On' leaving Oxford, he
 was returned for the King’s County, which he represented in Parliament for
 eight years.     He was not an active debater, though, whenever he spoke,
 he commanded attention; but in matters of business, and especially on
 committees, he had few equals. He then retired for a few years from poli
 tical life to follow his favourite pursuit with more leisure, and discharge
 more completely the duties of a landed proprietor, in which he was exem
 plary.    He was not exclusively devoted to astronomy or mechanics.             In
 fact few minds of our day have grasped so wide a range of knowledge.           He
 was a master of political economy, a greater one than many of its more
 renowned champions;        for he brought to bear on it the sound common
  sense which was one of his chief attributes.        He also devoted much atten
 tion to the great question of national education, and the loss of his autho
 rity and in<U+FB02>uence on that subject is deeply felt in Ireland at the present
  moment.      He was a good chemist, would have attained a high position as
  a civil engineer, and possessed a large amount of military and nautical
  knowledge.     As evidence of this it may be mentioned that he had formed
  the conception of armoured ships some years before the Crimean \Var, and
 had thoroughly investigated the problem.            His calculations showed that
 vessels of   no  great tonnage  could carry   a  sheathing of 4-inch plates which
 would be proof against the 32-pounder, the normal gun of the time. His
  elaborate memoir was sent into the authorities, acknowledged,        and probably
 forgotten.
     In 1836 he married Miss Field, the daughter of a Yorkshire gentleman,

                                        xxxvii
in whom he found one worthy of himself.              She sympathized in all his
pursuits, masteredzenough of astronomy to] help'him in his calculations,
and entered into all his plans for the welfare of his tenantry and the good
 of her adopted country.         And this last required no common strength of
mind, for there was what might well startle a young Englishwoman.
Kind and bene<U+FB01>cent as her husband was, he was not less resolute in sup
porting the authority of law and putting down the murderous societies
which were the terror and curse of that part of Ireland. This, of course,
made him a mark for the assassin ; he knew his danger; but the knowledge
 neither made him shrink from his duty, nor embittered his feelings against
the misguided people who were conspiring against him.            He held on his
 steady way, sustained by his calm determined courage, and perhaps by the
 fear inspired by his great physical power and consummate skill in the use of
 arms.      For several years this danger existed, so that in his own park and
 at his telescope it was felt that all who could use weapons had better carry
 them.       This continued till the terrible famine which ensued, crushed out
 under the weight of real misery the imaginary grievances of the agitators
 and showed men as they were. And none bore the test better than Lord
 Rosse,     who   applied   to relieve the distress which  surrounded  him,  not
 merely the power which belongs to habits of business and sound judgment,
 but something still more appreciable to common eyes; for during some
 years he devoted nearly all the income of his Irish property to give the
 unhappy sufferers the means of existence. This told on their hearts; and
 now also they began to be proud of his fame and to regard him as an
 honour to their nation, so that for the latter part of his life he ceased to
 be an object of hostility.
      On the death of his father in 1841, he was elected an Irish Repre
  sentative Peer; in 1831 he had been appointed Lord Lieutenant of his
  County ; from 1848 to 1854 he was President of the Royal Society; and
  in 1862 he was elected Chancellor of the University of Dublin.
      IIis appearance promised a long life, but it was cut short by an accident
  so tri<U+FB02>ing that it was neglected till too late.    A slight sprain of the knee
  produced, after some       months, a tumour which was ultimately removed by
  a. severe   operation.   The wound was slowly healing, but his strength sunk
  in the process;      and on October 31 he died as he had lived, patient and
  uncomplaining       under his long and acute sufferings, gentle and considerate
  to all around him, and strong in Christian hope.
      We think these personal details will interest the Society on their own
  account; but they also may serve_to illustrate the habits of thought and
  action which guided Lord Rosse in those researches which culminated in
   the magni<U+FB01>cent instrument with which his name will ever be connected.
      So early as 1826 his attention was directed to the improvement of the
  re<U+FB02>ecting telescope, and it is instructive to trace the steps of his progress
  as recorded      in his papers in Brewster’s Edinburgh Journal, and those
   which    appear in our Transactions for 1840, 1850, and 1861.        They are

                                    xxxviii
entirely original; for there was no available information except the memoirs
of Mudgc and Edwards, which were only applicable to specula of four or
<U+FB01>ve inches diameter.    Lord Rosse’s starting-point was the necessity of using
speculum metal of the highest standard.     For this he combined four equi
valents of copper and one of tin : this compound is very brilliant and
resists tarnish far better than if there be a slight excess of either ingre
dient.   A striking example of this is a compound speculum polished in
1830, which lay neglected in his laboratory, yet a few years ago was still
quite bright.   Arsenic and other metals which have been recommended in
small quantity, he tried, but preferred the simple alloy.  This, however, is
nearly the most intractable of all materials—harder   than steel, more brittle
than glass, friable, crystalline, and, worst of all, <U+FB02>ying in pieces with any
sudden change of temperature.        In consequence, the common process of
the founder does not avail here, except on a small scale; and all large
specula which had been previously made contained a larger proportion of
copper than the above, that they might have the necessary toughness.
Yet more, he shared the general belief that the polishing could only be
done by hand, that it was essential to feel the nature of the contact,
that therefore only small surfaces could be accurately <U+FB01>gured. For both
reasons he was led to build up a speculum of small pieces.   His <U+FB01>rst
attempt was very ingenious.  He combined  a central disk with annular
zones two or three inches broad, and ground and polished them               spherical.
In                                        focus than those within
     such a surface, each zone is of shorter                           and     it,
the resulting image would be indistinct.   But by     <U+FB01>t adjustment, each,
                                                          a
beginning at the centre, was drawn back till their foci coincided; and the
action of the compound was good even with an aperture of eighteen inches.
Yet the complexity of the arrangement and its liability to change with
temperature were weighty objections, and he was led            by
                                                              new fact to
                                                                    a
devise another plan. In polishing these rings, he found the outer ones too
large for hand-work, and made in 1828     machine which gave
                                             a                  rectilinear
                                                                        a
motion    to the polisher, while the speculum revolved slowly.   This was
only expected   to produce   aspherical <U+FB01>gure, but caused
                                                     it   rings  and other
irregularities, which he saw would be corrected by adding    second exccn
                                                                  a
tric, which, by giving lateral motion to the polisher, changed its course
                         a
into   curve which might be varied from
       a                                   right line to an ellipse almost
                                                 a
circular.  This had the desired effect but on watching its action he saw
                                         ;
that    would also give what was the great desideratum,
       it                                                 change of curva
                                                              a
ture from the centre to the circumference which could be varied at pleasure,
and therefore could be made to give true aplanatic <U+FB01>gure. The machine so
                                     a
altered was employed through his whole life with only one important change,
which was   ameans of setting the six-feet vertical while on the polishing ma
chine, and testing  it by    terrestrial mark.
                             a                    This was added in 1862, and
very much  facilitated  the obtaining a   perfect <U+FB01>gure. He met the dif<U+FB01>culty
of obtainingalarge speculum by making         astrong frame of  peculiar brass
                                                                  a
which has the same expansion as <U+FB01>ne speculum-metal,           and soldering on its

                                                 xxxix
front thin plates of the latter, cast on as large a scale as possible, and
closely <U+FB01>tting them at the edges.       From what has been said of the pro
perties of this alloy, it may be judged how much mechanical skill the pro
cess required; but he succeeded in making a three-feet speculum, described
in the Transactions for 1840. It was very light and strong, and de<U+FB01>ned
perfectly, except that with large stars the diffraction at the joints produced
four minute rays.      For those below the <U+FB01>fth magnitude, and of course for
fainter objects, this defect is insensible ; and Lord Rosse believed that in
this way only would it be possible to attain the extreme limit of telescopic
vision.     The construction is stronger than the solid speculum with a
third of its weight; and the cellular distribution of the greater part of
the mass enables it to assume the temperature of the atmosphere far
more rapidly.      During these experiments he was led to an important im
provement in the casting of speculum-metal.           When the melted alloy is
poured    into a  mould  the surfaces of  it in contact with the mould harden,
while   the interior of the  mass is still <U+FB02>uid ; this cools in its turn, and in
contracting exerts a powerful drag on the outerjcrust which gives way, and
the whole is shivered.   Besides, if the solidi<U+FB01>cation is gradual the mass
assumes a crystalline character, which gives              it,
                                                   when polished,  mottled a
surface.   Lord Rosse met these dif<U+FB01>culties by forming the bottom of his
mouldof  iron, the sides of sand, and by leaving the top open  the metal in
                                                                  :
contact with the iron congealed almost in an instant, the sides of the spe
culum more slowly, as the sand        worse conductor than the iron, the
                                                is   a
upper part remaining <U+FB02>uid longest  so that the contraction occurred chie<U+FB01>
                                            ;                                          y
at the back of the speculum, where     did no harm, while the front pre
                                                     it
sented   layer of uniform and comparatively tough material.
         a                                                      He found,
however, that this layer    little more liable to tarnish than that which
                              is   a
is cooled slowly.        The process    quite di<U+FB01>'erent from the chilling of cast
                                           is
iron, with which    it   has sometimes been confounded.    All this was well but   ;
now another dif<U+FB01>culty was found.    Copper in fusion absorbs    large quan
                                                                   a
tity of oxygen, much of which   gives out
                                       it on becoming solid, and  speculum
metal appears to possess the same property.    Owing to this         always
                                                                           is is
                                                                      it
full of microscopic pores, and the escape of the gas when the alloy cooled
by contact with the iron, as    cannot rise through the viscid <U+FB01>lm which
                                   it                                                  is
formed, probably causes the bubbles and cavities which are found even
when no air  isentangled in the pouring.   To give this gas free escape
                                                                   a
was the obvious remedy, and that was effected by making the bottom of
the mould of hoop iron, placed on edge and packed so closely that                      it
retained the metal, but was pervious to gases.  The plan was so successful
that in 1840 he had <U+FB01>nished    solid three-feet speculum, and had satis<U+FB01>ed
                                       a
himself that even   asix-feet was quite practicable.
   He soon made the attempt, and succeeded in April 1842, in obtaining
a perfect cast which, after being partly ground, was broken            by
                                                                   the care
lessness of aworkman: two other failures are mentioned in his third paper;
one of which, however, actually gave     disk more than seven feet diameter,
                                                     a

                                     xl
though of course too thin for use.    This he regarded as a valuable result,
for it showed the possibility of going far beyond the six feet, should such
optical power ever he required.      In these disasters his unfailing good
temper and patience were not less admirable    than his exhaustless   mecha
nical talent. The whole mighty instrument   was so far complete by Fe
bruary 1845, that on the 13th of that month he, his friend the late Sir
James South, and another, saw in a lucid interval of clouds a few double
stars and clusters.
   Lord Rosse has given in the paper just referred to (1861) ample details
of the telescope, both in respect of casting and <U+FB01>guring the specula and of
the mechanism by which it is pointed to the heavens, and the observers
enabled to use it with convenience and safety.        In these we need not fol
low him beyond noticing the modest and undemonstrative character of the
description, which gives but a very faint idea of the magni<U+FB01>cence of what
he had achieved.      To those of us who have seen the telescope, and still
more to the few who were present at the casting and polishing of the
 specula, it is but a lifeless shadow.  They can never forget the machinery
and furnaces that were installed in the towers and courts of the old castle
whose walls still show traces of the sieges sustained in times of yore,
the intelligence and discipline of the workmen whom he had formed from
ignorant Irish labourers, and above all the matchlcss self-possession and
unfailing resources of the master mind that guided all. In even beholding
the instrument it is not easy to realize its colossal vastness; the machinery
which moves it disappoints by its excessive simplicity, and it is not till one
stands in the highest observing gallery and looks into the profound below,
or over the surrounding country, that he obtains a true measure of its
magnitude, and feels that it is sublime.      It deserves notice that all this
massive work was executed in Lord Rosse’s laboratory, and that the whole
had been so thoroughly considered that in no instance was it found neces
sary to deviate from the drawings which had been prepared.
   With respect to its optical power, little need be added to what is said in
the memoir of 1861.    A   more unfavourable   location for it could hardly be
found   than the vicinity of the Bog of Allen; and its performance gives
little earnest of what it could do in a <U+FB01>ner climate and a few thousand feet
above the sea. Hitherto it has also suffered from a disturbing cause pecu
liar to re<U+FB02>ectors, and increasing very rapidly with their bulk. Besides the
undulations   of the air through which they look (which affect all tele
scopes), they have air-currents in their tubes caused by the great speculum
being warmer than the atmosphere.        The air in contact with the metal is
heated, and rises along the upper side of the tube, while a stream of cold
 air replacesit, descending on the lower; and the eddies of the two cause
 strange wings and twirlings in the image. This goes on increasing as the
 night becomes colder, till sometimes all de<U+FB01>nition  is lost. An example of
 this was given on March    5,  1845.   The speculum was uncovered while
 cooler than the air, and was, of course, dewed.    This did not dry off till

                                         xli
Regulus was passing ; that star was shown as a round point of intolerable
light; but as the night wore, the de<U+FB01>nition declined till 6 Bootes came,
which it only showed as two coloured <U+FB02>ares, and Lord Rosse gave up further
observing as useless.       On October 20, 1848, under similar cicumstances
of uncovering the speculum, the blue star of y Andromeda: was seen with
1500 divided a full diameter of the larger component, the colours blue and
purple.      The previous evening, after a longer exposure, the star looked
elongated, and the division appeared only by glimpses.          For this there
seem but two possible remedies, to keep the speculum as near the tempe
rature of the air as possible, and to make the tube of open work, so that
the warmed air may 'escape as soon as possible.         The <U+FB01>rst of these was
not easily practicable with so huge a block of metal, though he thought it
could be effected; but the other, which was many years ago suggested by
 Sir John Herschel, he tried on the three-feet, and with such success that
he resolved to       apply a similar tube to the six-feet when it should re
 quire renewal.      This will uncloubtedly extend its good de<U+FB01>nition through
a greater portion of the night, and make it more potent for the resolu
 tion of nebulae. But, even under average atmospheric conditions, its power
is astonishing.       No achromatic in Britain gives any adequate notion of
the way in which it shows the moon, close contrasted double stars, or
 clusters like 13 Messier.       lts chief employment, however, has been on
nebulae, and the results which they have afforded are very remarkable.
That it resolved a multitude of them which resisted all other telescopes
 was a matter of course ; but it also revealed in many ofthese strange bodies
 the existence of forms and forces completely at variance with our previous
 conceptions of celestial mechanics.      Many of the observations are given in
 our ‘Transactions’ for 1850 and 1861; and it may suf<U+FB01>ce to indicate a
 few of their results.      The most remarkable is the spiral arrangement,
 which seems to prevail very commonly in nebulae, and occasionally in
 clusters. Sometimes the spirals are as regular as the <U+FB01>re-curves of a pyro
 technic wheel; sometimes, when seen obliquely, like the section of a
 snail-shell  ; sometimes almost foreshortened into a ring ; occasionally there
 is a double system; and in one or two instances the two sets turn in dif
 ferent   directions.    The dynamical condition which is implied by these
 appearances cannot be explained by any cosmicalforces with which we are
 acquainted, and it is an object of the highest interest to science that they
  should be carefully watched for any signs of change.
     It has also been ascertained that a remarkable class of nebulae,     called
  Planetary from appearing like uniform circular or elliptic disks, have no
 existence ; they are shown to be systems of rings, sometimes very compli
 cated, so that annular nebulm, of which only two were previously known
 in our hemisphere, are by no means uncommon.            And thirdly,  some   in
 formation    has been gained as to nebulous stars.    These rare objects di<U+FB01>'er
 from ordinary stars in having a round atmosphere of some extent, and
 faintly luminous.      This is not continuous, as had been supposed; some

                                           xlii
 times consisting of rings, sometimes separated by a dark interval from the
 central star.    Such facts do not well accord with the old nebular hypo
 thesis, but rather indicate a permanent state like that which last year pre
 vailed for a few days in the noted star of the Northern Crown, in which a
 solid luminous nucleus is surrounded by an atmosphere heated to incan
 descence.    It is far from improbable that such is also the case with many
 of those minute stars which this telescope reveals in thousands in bright
 nebulae, which it cannot entirely resolve.          The stars and the nebula are
 evidently  connected,  yet  as  evidently   of different  nature.  As an example
 may be taken the great nebula of Orion, in which, when the speculum is
 in <U+FB01>ne order, it shows these lucid points as thick as dust, while yet there is
 manifestly a different source of light.           In this case the nebula seems
 brighter than the stars ; and so Mr. Huggins has found that the nebular
 spectrum alone is visible.       On this, and many similar questions, each new
 observation opens an ever~widening <U+FB01>eld of inquiry; and it is permitted
 to us to hope that the unrivalled power of this mighty instrument will
 still be exerted in that <U+FB01>eld, and that the son and successor of him whom
 we so deeply regret will follow his example in this, as in all else for which
 he was honoured and loved—T. R. R.
    James SMITH, ofJordan Hill, near Glasgow, was born in Glasgow on the
 15th of August, 1782.      He was the eldest sonjof Archibald Smith, Esq., an
 eminent West India merchant in that city, and of Isabella Ewing, who died
a few years ago   in her 10lst year.
    Mr. Smith    was educated        at the Grammar       School and University   of
 Glasgow.    He was for many years a sleeping partner in the West India
 House of Leitch and Smith in that city, but never took any active part in
business.    His tastes directed him to literary and scienti<U+FB01>c pursuits and
the <U+FB01>ne arts.    He was in early life an enthusiastic book collector, particu
larly in the department of early voyages and travels, of which he has left
a large and valuable collection.        His love of yachting was one of the most
prominent    features  in  his  life,  and it was lifelong.    His <U+FB01>rst cruise in a
yacht of his own was in the year 1806 ; his last in the year 1866.          He was
one of the earliest members of the Royal Yacht Club, now the Royal Yacht
Squadron ; and was one of the earliest and latest Commodores of the
Royal Northern Yacht Club.
   Most of M r. Smith’s scienti<U+FB01>c and literary researches were connected with
his love of yachting.     His earliest paper in any scienti<U+FB01>c publication was a
notice in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh of an un
described vitri<U+FB01>ed fort, in the Burnt Isles in the Kyles of Bute, disco
vered by him in accidentally landing from his yacht.               In geology, the
science to which he was peculiarly attached, his attention was early directed
to the question as to the relative position of the land and sea which had
subsisted at remote geological epochs; and the west of Scotland, the district
in which he resided, o<U+FB01>'ered admirable opportunities for his inquiries.          In

  the sandstone cliffs between Gourock and Largs, in the trap-dykes of Cum
  brae, and, indeed, nearly all round the coasts of the Firth of Clyde, there
  was unmistakeable        evidence of the slow and long-continued action of the
  sea; and the beds of fossil shells found at various elevations, and remote
  from the present coast, obviously demonstrated that a great part of Scot—
  land had, at a comparatively late geological period, been covered by the sea.
   In pursuing his researches, Mr. Smith soon perceived the importance of
   carefully comparing the shells of the living species of mollusca in European
   and more northern seas with those found in the super<U+FB01>cial deposits of
   Scotland now known as post—pliocene or glacial drift, and with the forms
  occurring in raised beaches and other later formations.            These researches
   he conducted by dredging explorations from his yacht.             In this investiga
   tion he discovered that a large proportion of the mollusks whose shells are
   found in these deposits, but do not now exist in the Clyde, are still to be
   found living in the arctic seas.      This led him to the conclusion announced
   to the Geological Society in      1836,  of the existence, before the present state
   of things, of   a colder climate than the present—~11 conclusion which, though
   opposed to what geologists had previously believed, is now universally ac
   cepted.     In continuing his investigations, Mr. Smith found reason to dis
    tinguish  the deposits in question into two, in the older of which a consider
   able proportion of shells and other remains had belonged to animals now
   extinct in our latitudes, but in the later of which, belonging to a more re
   cent period, every one of the shells has been found as species now exist
  ing, though     some of them only in the arctic seas.         This is the period of
   long repose   of  the  land,   at a depression   of about  40  feet below the sea,
   which now has left the modern          shores  of  the west   of Scotland fringed,
  at an elevation of 40 feet, with that old sea-cliff which is so marked a fea
   ture in its scenery.
       From 1839 to 1846         the health of members of his family caused Mr.
  Smith to reside successively at Madeira, Gibraltar, Lisbon, and Malta, and
  valuable geological papers on each of those localities attest the zeal with
  which he pursued his favourite science.
       His residence at Malta was the occasion of the remarkable series of inves
   tigations by which he is best known in literature and theology.          These were
                                   ‘
   <U+FB01>rst published in [8.18 in The Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul, with
   Dissertations on the Life and Writings of St. Luke, and the Ships and
  N avigatiou of the Ancients.’
       The part of the volume which relates to the voyage and shipwreck of St.
  Paul has    been accepted by all critics and theologians who have since written
  as conclusively    settling all doubtful and contested questions as to the nar
  rative.    This   work   is a remarkable instance of originality, ingenuity, and
  sagacity, and of the application of practical knowledge of seamanship
'
  and geology to the elucidation of a point of literary and theological
  interest.
       The minute study of the writings of St. Luke, to which Mr. Smith             was

                                          xliv
thus led, conducted him to a view on the much-contested           question of the
connexion of the <U+FB01>rst three Gospels, which was <U+FB01>rst published in the ‘ Dis
sertation on the Life and \Vritings of St. Luke,’ to which we have referred,
and which was afterwards worked out in greater detail in a separate ‘ Dis
sertation on the Origin and Connexion of the Gospels,’ published in 1853.
On this subject Mr. Smith’s view, which differs from any previously taken,
though not accepted to the same extent as his conclusions respecting the
voyage of St. Paul, has had many followers.           He was engaged in the col
lection of materials for a more extended dissertation         on the same subject
when interrupted by his last illness.
     Mr. Smith was a member of many scienti<U+FB01>c societies—of the Royal
 Society, the Geological Society, and the Royal Geographical Society of
 London, and the Royal Society of Edinburgh.              He was president of the
 Geological Society of Glasgow and of the Archaeological Society, and was for
 many years president of the Andersonian University in that city, and was un
 wearied in his exertions for its bene<U+FB01>t, and for the improvement of its value
 able museum.        The date of his election into the Royal Society is Dec. 23,
  1830.
     Mr.   Smith enjoyed vigorous health till the spring of last year, when a
 slight   stroke  of paralysis enfeebled his body, without affecting his mind. A
 further attack towards the close of the year terminated in his death at Jordan
  Hill on the 17th of January, 1867.
      Mr.  Smith was married in 1809 to Mary Wilson, granddaughter of Dr.
  Alexander    Wilson, Professor of Astronomy in the University of Glasgow.
  By   her,  who died in 1847, he had nine children, of whom three survive,
  —Archibald Smith, Esq., F.R.S., late Fellow of Trinity College, Cam
  bridge, a member of the Chancery Bar, and two daughters.
      Sm JAMES      SOUTH, born in October 1785, was the eldest son of an emi
  nent Pharmaceutical       Chemist    resident in Sonthwark.    Educated at a pri
  vate school, he acquired a fair knowledge of Greek          and Latin, and such
  elementary instruction in mathematics as was current in those days.             On
  leaving school he commenced the study of surgery, which he chose as a
  profession;    combining with it that of chemistry, in which he was no ordi
  nary pro<U+FB01>cient.      In due time he became a member of the College of Sur
  geons,    and  rose  rapidly into extensive practice.      Sir A. Cooper, whose
  dresser he had been for a time, believed that if he had persevered he would
  have been one of the most eminent surgeons of his time.            But a different
  fate was before him. While yet a boy his curiosity had been excited by a
   singular erection on the roof of a house near his father’s, and he contrived
   to get acquainted with its owner.         This was Huddart, an engineer of dis
   tinguished    talent;   known, among other inventions, by machinery for
   making ropes in which every <U+FB01>bre bears an equal strain.            The structure
   was a dome for containing      the equatoreal which afterwards became famous
   by his and Sir    John   Herschel’s   observations  of double stars.   The   ideas

                                        xlv
which he got from his visits to Huddart were not lost; and as soon as he
was able, be procured a 6-inch Gregorian with which he observed eclipses,
occultations, and looked at double stars.        Observing soon became a pas
sion; and when, in 1816, his marriage with          a lady who brought him a
considerable    fortune   made him    no longer dependent on his professional
work, be resolved to devote himself to astronomy. He began by constructing
at his house in Blackman Street a magni<U+FB01>cent observatory.        After the death
of Huddart he purchased the equatoreal which had been his <U+FB01>rst inspirer; a
<U+FB01>ne transit instrument, which he described in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1826, was soon added; and a circle was in progress.             His zeal for
astronomy and his personal character won the regard of such men as Davy,
Wollaston, Kater, Babbage, Baily, the two Herschels, and, at a later period,
Faraday and Lord Rosse ; and his house was a centre of scienti<U+FB01>c reunion.
He took an active part in the formation of the Astronomical Society; and,
in conjunction with Baily, exposed the defects of the ‘ Nautical Almanac ’
so effectually, that after some years of discussion it was brought to its pre
sent excellence in accordance with the recommendations of a committee, of
which he was the chairman. From 1821 (when he became a Fellow of the
Royal Society) till 1824 he worked with Sir John Herschel in forming the
Catalogue of 380 double stars which (with a description of the equatoreal)
appears in the Transactions for 1825. For this they obtained conjointly the
medal of the Institute, and till the publication of Struve’s Dorpat Catalogue
it  was quite unrivalled.     During its progress it became too evident that the
smoky atmosphere of the Borough was ill suited for delicate observations ;
and he transported another equatoreal to Passy, near Paris, where be ex
pected to <U+FB01>nd a purer sky. He resided there more than a year, enjoying
the society of those “men of renown,” of whom the chiefs were Arago,
Humboldt, and, above all, Laplace, whose scepticism about the orbits of
 double stars he had the pleasure of removing by showing him the angular
motion of 70 Ophiuchi, the components of which were then near their least
 distance.     The fruits of this    sojourn appear in the Transactions       for
 1826 as an additional     catalogue of 458 double stars, for which, and his
         “ On the Sun’s
 paper                       Right Ascension,” he was awarded the Copley
 medal of that year and the gold medal of the Astronomical Society.           On
 his return to England he purchased a property at Kensington, where he
 was free from smoke, not foreseeing (though many people who ought to have
 known better supposed him to be an Astrologer) that he should live to
 see it in the heart of a dense population.          There, of course, he built a
 magni<U+FB01>cent observatory, the <U+FB01>nest private one probably that ever existed.
 It was now increased by the purchase of Groombridge’s meridian-circle, to
 which he had eight additional microscopes applied by its maker, and by
 a valuable clock, the   gift of the King of Denmark. By this time the labours
 of Guinand on optical glass had made it possible to construct object-glasses
 of a size till then unattainable ; and be determined to procure one of the
 highest power, and pursue with his whole energy the career on which he

                                                   xlvi
had so successfully entered.  For this work he. was highly gifted; he had
akeen eye, asteady hand, great power of bearing fatigue and want of sleep,
prompt decision in catching a bisection, and boundless enthusiasm. Frann
hofer, to whom he applied in the <U+FB01>rst instance, declined giving him an
object-glass without also supplying its equatoreal.  It would have been a
happy thing  for him had  he accepted  this proposal; but he had no faith
in any instrument maker but Troughton, whom he worshipped with all the
intense devotion of his impulsive character.     He looked elsewhere :
Canchoix had completed a l2-inch object-glass, about which, in 1829, he
was cha<U+FB02>'ering with the French Government; South heard of     went over                 it,
to Paris, tried     paid it,
                         the optician the price which he demanded. and
started with   next morning on his way to England, to the great disgust of
               it it
Arago that    was lost to France.  But   was   fatal acquisition.
                                                          it    a Trough
ton was of course charged with the construction of the equatoreal; and                            a
dome for containing             it      was   also commenced.        Unhappily, both of them
were planned without much respect for the elementary principles of engi—
neering, the <U+FB01>rst especially; and though Mr. Babbage and others pointed
out to him its utter weakness, he merely answered, “        designed by     It     is
Troughton.”    He had no knowledge of mechanical science, and had unli
mited faith in Troughton's infallibility. As was foretold, the instrument
was a failure; and though many attempts were made to correct the inhe
rent vices of its framing, they were only partially successful. The result
was a  deadly quarrel between the two friends (which perhaps might have
been healed but for the intervention of other personal animosities), and a
litigation, which after run of four years was decided in way unsatisfac
                                    a                                          a
tory to both parties, most so to South.   The dome was also failure; in                 a
general itrequired four or <U+FB01>ve men to move       sometimes      stuck fast!
                                                                it   ;               it
The loss of full £8000 thus spent without any useful result was itself                            a
misfortune; but    was as nothing in comparison of the evil in<U+FB02>uence which
                         it
these transactions exerted on his character. The feeling that his con<U+FB01>dence
had been misplaced, that the friendship which had been his ruling passion,
and which he still cherished, was changed into bitter hate, made him sus
picious and irritable  and he lost that reliance on the truthfulness and
                               ;
honesty of others, without which life becomes      desert.   By degrees this
                                                                     a
left him in an isolation from many old and true friends    and also, as  ne;                  a
cessary consequence, deadencd his love of science, which, like all other
good things,        is
                strengthened by sympathy.    And he had no longer    de<U+FB01>                      a
nite pursuit  he could not resolve to adopt any practicable form of equa
                ;
toreal, though Lord Rosse offered to design and even to make one for him                          ;
and during the years that were wasted, the harvest of double stars which
he had hoped to reap was gathered by Sir        Herschel, the two Struves,
                                                               J.
Bond, and others.    This object-glass, while in his possession, made only
one discovery, the sixth star in the trapezium of Orion        and remained      ;
useless till he gave  to the Dublin Observatory in
                               it                    1862, when Lord Rossc
was elected Chancellor                  of that University.     In   the hands of Dr. Briinnow

                                        xlvii
it willdoubtless be well employed. South, however, still worked with his me
ridian instruments; among other things he observed a considerable num
ber of stars with the Groombridge circle, and the results are probably valu
able, as each observation was direct and re<U+FB02>ected on the same night with
twelve microscopes.     He for some years carried on an elaborate series of
experiments on clocks to ascertain their performance in mean, the air’s re
sistance to pendulums, the in<U+FB02>uence of various modes of suspending them,
and the effect of screens in their vicinity.   These are, it is believed, all pre
served, and may perhaps he published.        Another object to which he devoted
much research, was the disturbance which might occur to an observatory from
the vicinity ofa railroad; and an account of his observations at “'atford
respecting    it,
              which appears in our Proceedings for 186     was his last con

sight  were almost  entirely lost, and this helpless condition was made more
af<U+FB02>icting bymuch bodily suffering, from which he was released onOctober 19,
1867.  He was knighted in 1831 by William IV., with whom he was favo~    a
rite. He was one of the original Visitors of Greenwich Observatory, and        a
Member of the Astronomical    Society, the Linuean, the Royal Society of
Edinburgh, Royal  Irish Academy, and of several others—T. R. R.
   Josaru TOYNBEE, well known as an eminent Aural Surgeon, was dis
tinguished for the remarkable industry with which he strove to give            a
scienti<U+FB01>c character to the branch of medical practice to which he had de
voted himself.      He   was born atHeckington, in Lincolnshire, and died at
his professional    residence, in London, on the 7th of July, 1866, in the
<U+FB01>fty-<U+FB01>rst year of his age.
." After completing his education at Lynn, Mr. Toyubee was articled to
Mr. Wm. Wade, of the Westminster General Dispensary, and afterwards
became    a pupil at St. George’s Hospital. Having early exhibited       ataste
for anatomical pursuits, he was, whilst still young, appointed Assistant
Curator in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.            Soon after
this, his love of anatomical inquiry displayed itself in  amicroscopic inves
tigation, the results of which were embodied in      a paper read before the
Royal Society, and published        the Philosophical Transactions for 1841,
                                   in
entitled " Researches tending to prove the Non-vascularity of certain
Animal Tissues, and to demonstrate the peculiarly uniform mode of their
 Organization and Nutrition.”     This memoir, though, when viewed        bythe
light of recent histology, of but limited scope, was       a real contribution
to science at the period of its publication.
   In his subsequent labours, Mr. Toynbee turned his attention exclusively
to the Anatomy, Physiology and Pathology of the Organs of Hearing.
Thus be contributed to the Meetings of the Royal Society four papers,
bearing the following titles :—1. “On the Structure of the Membrana
Tympani of the Human Ear” (1850).           2. “On the Function of the Mem—
brane. Tympani, the Ossicles and Muscles of the Tympanum,           and of the

                                       xlviii
Eustachian     Tube in the Human Ear, with an Account of the Muscles of
the Eustachian     Tube, and their Action in different Classes of Animals”
                                                                    ”
(1852). 3. “On the Muscles which open the Eustachian Tube              (1853) .
4. “On the Mode in which Sonorous Vibrations are conducted from the
Membrana Tympani to the Labyrinth in the Human Ear" (1859).                The
<U+FB01>rst of the above-named memoirs was published in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1851 ; whilst, of the other three, records will be found in
the Society’s ‘ Proceedings.’                                                   .
    In investigating the pathology     of the ear, Mr. Toynbee proceeded by
collecting a very large number of specimens of the human temporal
bones and their contained parts, both healthy and diseased.       The morbid
specimens,    said to number    nearly  1700, were described by him   in nume
rous contributions    to the Royal Medical and Chirurgieal Society, to the
Pathological Society, and to various journals. Besides this, he published
an interesting ‘Descriptive Catalogue of Preparations illustrative of Dis
seases of the Ear in his Museum,’        and also a systematic work on ‘The
 Diseases of the Ear; their Nature, Diagnosis and Treatment,’ besides oc
casional
           “ Lectures ”  on the same subject.
    He was for some time Surgeon to the St. George’s and St. James’s
 Dispensary, and was engaged in the general practice of Surgery; but,
 whilst retaining the title of Consulting Surgeon to the above-named Insti
 tution, he soon devoted his time and energy to Aural Surgery alone, in
 which department of his profession he gradually acquired a wide-spread
 reputation, his practice as an Aurist ultimately becoming very large.      He
 was Consulting Aural Surgeon to St. Mary’s Hospital, and to the Asylum
for the Deaf and Dumb.
    Mr. Toynbee’s premature and sudden death was caused by the inhala
 tion of chloroform, on the possibility of introducing which powerful
 agent into    the tympanic   cavities through the Eustachian tubes he had
long   been experimenting.     He was found dead on his sofa, in his consult
 ing-room in Savile Row, with cotton-wool over his face, and a chloroform
 bottle, his open watch, and various memorauda of experiments lying near
him. It is but just, and it may be useful, to remark, that, while he doubt
less fell a sacri<U+FB01>ce to his experimental zeal, the deplorable event is in all
probability to be ascribed to the extreme imprudence of inhaling chlo
 roform when alone and unattended.
    The subject of this brief notice was a man of enlightened intellect,
 quick temperament, and energetic habits, of enlarged views, cultivated
 taste, and benevolent disposition.      In connexion with the St. George’s
 and St. James’s Dispensary, he founded a Samaritan Fund to provide
 the sick poor with bread, soup, wine, <U+FB02>annels, and coals, and also the
 means of ventilating     their apartments.      He was not only an active
 Treasurer to the Medical Benevolent Fund, but was an anonymous
  donor to it of the muni<U+FB01>ceut gift of £500.       He advocated the establish
  ment of local museums, libraries, and institutes, the better education of

                                          xlix
   the working classes, and the improvement of the dwellings of the poor;
   and, at one time, spent much time and money in furtherance of such ob
  jects and purposes.      He was vigorous and lively in both his professional
   lectures and his more popular “lecturettes,” as he himself preferred to
   call them.      His neighbours and friends at Wimbledon, where he latterly
   resided,   fully appreciated his excellent public and social qualities.     The
   date of his election into the Royal Society is March 10, 1842.
      ROBERT WARINGTON was born on the 7th of September, 1807, at
   Sheerness, where his father, Thomas Warington, who was a victualler of
   ships, then resided.     He was educated at Merchant Taylors’ School, and,
   being intended for a land-surveyor, he was, on leaving school, set to learn
   that business, but, after a few months, abandoned it in favour of chemistry,
   which he studied as the house pupil, and subsequently, in 1822, the arti
   cled apprentice of Mr.     J. T. Cooper, then a well-known lecturer and ma
'
   nufacturing chemist.
      On the opening of the London University (now University College) in
   1828,   Mr. Warington, having served his time with Mr. Cooper, was
   chosen by the Professor of Chemistry, Dr. Edward Turner, to be his
   assistant.    In that capacity he continued at the College for three years,
   during which period he communicated to the Philosophical Magazine his
  <U+FB01>rst published research, entitled “ Examination of a Native Sulphuret of
  Bismuth.”
      In  1831, Messrs. Truman, Hanbury and Buxton, desiring the services
  of an able young chemist in their great brewing establishment, engaged
  Mr. Warington, on the recommendation of Dr. Turner, and with them he
  remained till 1839.      His connexion with the brewery did not prevent his
  independent pursuit of chemistry, and during this period he contributed
                                                “ On the Establishment       of a
  papers to the Philosophical Magazine,
  System of Chemical Symbols” (Sept. 1832),            and  “On   the   Action  of
  Chromic Acid upon Silver” (Dec. 1837).
      On the death of Mr. Hennell in 1842, Mr. Warington was appointed
  Chemical Operator to the Society of Apothecaries, a position be con
  tinued to hold till about a year before his death.           His professional
  engagements now became numerous, and he was much employed as a
  scienti<U+FB01>c witness or adviser in important cases coming before the Courts
  of Law.
      Mr. Warington’s     scienti<U+FB01>c activity manifested itself in various ways.
  In   1841   he took an important part in the establishment of the Chemical
  Society, and became one of the original Secretaries, which post he held
  for ten years.     He was one of the promoters of the Royal College of Che
  mistry; and he took part in the formation of the Cavendish Society, and
  held the of<U+FB01>ce of Secretary for three years.      He was Chemical Referee of
  four of the principal gas companies of the metr0polis.     He served as Juror
  in the Chemical Section of the International     Exhibition of 1862, and was
      VOL. XVI.                                                       e

                                            l
  appointed to a similar of<U+FB01>ce in the Paris Exhibition of 1867, but was un
  able to discharge the duty.
     Mr. Warington’s       scienti<U+FB01>c acquaintance with Pharmacy, and the large
  experience   he  had acquired in the practice of the art, led to his being
  employed in revising the translation of the London Pharmacopmia, left
  un<U+FB01>nished    by Mr. Phillips, and in aiding in the construction of the
  Pharmacopmia       of 1851.      For a like reason he was consulted by the
  Committee appointed to prepare the British Pharmacopoeia of 1864,
  and undertook     a  still more important share, along with Mr. Redwood, in
  the preparation of the British Pharmacopoeia of 1867, although his failing
  health allowed him but partially to perform his task.
     Amid these varied labours of his active and useful life, Mr. \Varing
  ton continued to furnish numerous contributions on chemical and pharma
  ceutical subjects, to the Memoirs and Quarterly Journal of the Chemical
  Society, the Philosophical Magazine,           and other periodical works.  To
  the Transactions      of the Microscopical Society, of which he was an
 ef<U+FB01>cient member, he contributed several papers, and he was the inventor
 of  a portable microscope,      which has been favourably spoken of.
    A   subject of more general interest, which furnished an agreeable and
 instructive study to Mr. Warington for many years, was the mode of life
 of aquatic animals and plants preserved in the aquarium; and especially
 the maintenance in a limited quantity of unrenewed water of the chemical
 conditions necessary to their existence, through the mutually compensa
 ting   operations    of animal and vegetable organisms upon the medium
 they inhabit.        The results of his observations were published, from
 time to time, for the most part in the ‘Annals of Natural History,’
 and also furnished the subject of a Lecture delivered by Mr. Warington
at one of the Friday Evening Meetings of the Royal Institution.              The
latest yield of these long-continued          researches which he lived to make
known, forms the subject of a valuable and interesting paper “ On some
Alterations in the Composition of Carbonate-of- Lime Waters, depending on
the In<U+FB02>uence of Vegetation, Animal Life, and Season,” communicated to
the Royal Society within a month of his death, and published in the
‘                ’
   Proceedings     of December 1867.
    In 1835 Mr. Warington married Miss Elizabeth Jackson, by whom
he has left a family.          He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in
June 1864 ,' he died at Budleigh Salterton, in the county of Devon, on
the 12th of November 1867.
    Mr. Warington       was remarkable   for his varied taste and constant aeti
vity   as  an observer;      he may be said, indeed, to have pased from one
subject    to another    with   too great a facility, and consequently his com
pleted investigations bear but a very small proportion to the number
of subjects he had continually under examination.           He was of an exceed
ingly cheerful and genial disposition, and a man of simple una<U+FB01>'ected
piety.

      Tan  Ravsnm WILLIAM          WHEWELL, D.D., late Master of Trinity Col
    lege, Cambridge,    and a, Fellow of this Society, was born on the 241th of
   hIay, 1794,. His career a<U+FB01>'ords one more, and a very striking illustration
   in addition to those which the biographical annals of our country so abun
   dantly present, of what may almost be regarded as the normal progress
   from an origin altogether devoid of external advantages, and in the
   humbler walks of life, to eminence and distinction as well as social posi
   tion, wrought out by innate talent rendered effective by energy and
   persevering application, and sustained by high moral qualities. Beyond
   his immediate parents, little is known of his family. His father, a man
   of probity and intelligence, pursued the calling of a joiner or house
   earpenter in Lancaster.       His mother appears to have been a person
   not only of excellent principle and good sense, but of some considerable
   mental culture. Their family consisted, besides himself, of a brother
   who died at an early age, and three sisters.      His own health in early
   youth was feeble, and afforded no prognostic of the robust frame and
   stalwart vigour which so strikingly characterized his manhood.      On the
   other hand, from his earliest years be manifested a. remarkable fondness
   for reading, and exhibited such general promise of future ability, as in
   duced his parents to remove him from the Grammar School in Lan
   caster, where he received the <U+FB01>rst rudiments of instruction, to that of
   Hcversham, where he might obtain the advantage of an Exhibition for
   admission to Trinity College, the Vicarage of Heversham being in
   the gift of that body.      This be secured, and was in consequence ad
   mitted at that College as a sub-sizar in the October term of 1812, and
  was subsequently elected as a full, or foundation sizar, and obtained a
   scholarship.     In 1816 he graduated as second Wrangler and Smith’s
   Prizemau,    the   <U+FB01>rst honours being carried off by a competitor (Mr.
   J aeob of Caius College) by whom to have been surpassed could no way
  be considered as a defeat.      His undergraduateship, meanwhile, had been
  distinguished by obtaining the Chancellor’s prize in 1813 for the best
  English Poem on the subject of Boadieea—a. spirited production, which
  may be read with pleasure as something beyond a college exercise, and
  evidencing that strong vein of poetical talent which showed itself on
  many subsequent occasions.
      In the year following his graduation as B.A., he was elected a Fellow
  of his College with whose interests and glory he ever afterwards con
  sidered his own as identi<U+FB01>ed, and was very soon engaged in lecturing in
'
  Mathematics as assistant tutor, and subsequently in 1823 as full tutor
  of one of the “ sides " of that numerous establishment, the tutor’s chair
  on the other “ side” being <U+FB01>lled by Dr. Peacock, afterwards Dean of
  Ely. This important office be <U+FB01>lled during the ensuing sixteen years,
  being joined in the performance of its duties during the last six with
  the Rev. Charles Perry, afterwards Bishop of Melbourne.          Soon after
  taking his Master of Arts’ degree, he entered into Holy orders, and in
                                                                 e 2

                                      lii
due course graduated    as Doctor of Divinity.     He accepted no College
living, however, or special cure of souls—not from any want of appre
tiation of the importance of the ministerial of<U+FB01>ce, or doubt of his own
aptitude for its exercise, but from a conscientious persuasion that his
true sphere of utility would be found in the entire devotion of his
powers to the furtherance of the objects of the University as a place of
education, and to the improvement of its system of instruction in those
 great branches of mental culture in which it was beginning to be felt
 at that epoch that such improvement was not only possible, but largely
 needed.     Such prospects we have seen amply realized; but it should
 not be forgotten for the credit of that illustrious establishment, that
 the movement in advance then making originated within itself, and was
 in no way forced upon it by any presure from without.               Thence
 forward, then, his career may be considered as identi<U+FB01>ed with the great
 cause of University improvement, and in a larger and more expansive
 point of view with that of philosophical, moral, and religious culture in
 the widest and best acceptation of the words.
     During the period when he was pursuing his studies at Cambridge,
 the mathematical department of the University curriculum was in what
 might be called a transitional state. A perception had begun to be
 entertained of the absolute necessity of including within its range a
 knowledge of those powerful methods of investigation so familiar to the
 Continental mathematicians,      but which could hardly be said to be
 known in England, and which at Cambridge had by some even been
 regarded with dislike, as innovational. In' this latter feeling, in common
 with most of its younger members, he was far from participating, but
 on the contrary was only desirous to forward the movement which he
 saw commencing.
     About the period when he entered       on his tutorial duties, a very
 general   sense had come  to be  entertained of this necessity; but a great
 obstacle to the introduction of an improved course of mathematical
 reading existed in the absence of elementary works in our own lan
 guage adapted for the purpose of university teaching, in which the
 principles of the analytical methods as applied to physical subjects
 were exhibited, and a yet greater in the utterly unphilosophical and
  inadequate mode of treatment in what were termed “the branches"
  current in the University.     The primary di<U+FB02>iculty had been removed
  by the translation by Peacock and his eoadjutors of the treatise of
  Laeroix on the differential and integral calculus published in 1816, and
  followed by a copious collection of examples illustrative of its applica
  tion to problems of pure mathematics and the theory of curves in 1820.
  But the want of readable elementary works in all the branches, and
  especially in that of dynamics, such as might, as it were, break the
  abruptness of the transition, and bridge over the interval between the
  modes of treatment of that subject in the ‘ Principia’ of Newton and

                                       liii
 in the modern analytical processes, was severely felt. Accordingly we
 <U+FB01>nd him in the period of his tutorship, from its very commencement,
 engaged in the production of a number of elementary treatises devoted
 to this object, and to conveying the primary principles of mechanical
 philosophy in a sound and logical form, as well as to affording an insight
 into the modern ways of handling them, such as his ‘ Elementary
 Treatise on Mechanics ’ (1819) ; his ‘Treatise on Dynamics ’ (1823) ;
 his ‘Introduction to Dynamics,’ ‘First Principles of Mechanics,’ and
 ‘
   Treatise on the free motion of a Point and on Universal Gravitation ”
                ‘                                                ‘
 (1832) ; his Elementary Treatise on Mechanics,’ and               Analytical
 Statics (1833), and his Mechanical Euclid’ (1837). Of these works,
         ’                  ‘
 the <U+FB01>rst mentioned has been considered by one excellently quali<U+FB01>ed to
                         “
judge of its merits as a work of great value, and very far in advance of
 any then existing text-book, for the clearness and correctness of its
 treatment of bodies in contact, and in the precision with which the
 assumptions involved in the laws of motion and the composition of forces
 are stated, and illustrated.”    At the end of the last named (the Me
 chanical Euclid) is attached a section “ on the Logic of Induction,” in
which the leading idea which forms the foundation of his great work on
the Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, published three years later,
viz. that Induction consists in superimlucing upon an assemblage of
 observed phenomena, a conception—the creation of the mind, which is
not in the phenomena, but which serves to bind them under a common
aspect, and so give them an ideal unity—is anticipatorin introduced.
    By these works, and by the in<U+FB02>uence which, as moderator in the
years 1820, 1828, and 1829, he was enabled to exercise on the course of
the examinations for degrees, he contributed materially to that im
provement he so much desired to see established in the mathematics of
the University.
    It would give but a very inadequate idea, however, of the extent of
his reading and of his extraordinary intellectual progress at this period
of his life, to measure them by these productions. A more wonderful
variety and amount of knowledge in almost every department of human
inquiry was perhaps never in the same interval of time accumulated by
any man; embracing not only Mathematical and Physical Science in
all its forms, but extending over Classical and Continental literature,
Metaphysics and History, Ethics, Social and Political Economy, together
with Botany, Architecture, Engineering, and a host of other subjects—and
that not by merely a general and super<U+FB01>cial acquaintance, but one which
an exact and conscientious     application such as most men devote to some
favourite branch of study, alone can give.     Nothing short of such a store
of precise and varied   information   could have  quali<U+FB01>ed him for the pro
duction of those great works on the History and on the Philosophy of
the Inductive Sciences which have placed his name among the brightest
in the annals of our Philosophy, and the former of which appeared in

                                          liv
the year 1887, during the continuance of his tutorship, and the latter
about three years later. These works were preceded (in 1833) by his
Bridgewater Treatise On Astronomy and general physics considered in
                          ‘
reference to Natural Theology.’          But that a great change in his views
as to the origin of our fundamental axioms must have taken place be
tween the production of these and the last-mentioned work, may be
inferred from a remarkable passage in that Treatise’l‘, in which he di
stinctly refers the origin of even the axioms of Mathematics to experi
ence, i. e. to a slow process of inductive observation, growing with our
growth, and not to any innate a priori intuition.
   Dr. Whewell was one of the founders of the Cambridge University
Philosophical Society, whose initiation dates from November 15, 1819,
its <U+FB01>rst Meeting for the election of Of<U+FB01>cers being held on December 13
of that year, when Professor Farish was chosen President, and Dr.
WheWell was placed on the list of its Council.               In 1820 he contributed
his <U+FB01>rst paper to its Transactions,
                                            “ On the position of the Apsides in
orbits of great excentricity.”          To the Transactions of this body he
continued to contribute, up to within a short period of his death, papers
on a great variety of subjects,—on Dynamics, on Mineralogy and Crys
tallography, on Logic and Philosophy (more especially on the Platonic
philosophy of ideas), and on the mathematical exposition of the doc—
trines of Political Economy, in which the formulae embodying the
results of those doctrines, as applied to questions of supply and demand,
                                                                               "
price, currency, &c., are derived from what he cautiously terms The
                        " in                      “                        ”
                                                                             of the
Equilibrium Theory             analogy to the Equilibrium Theory
Tides, distinguishing very justly between this and their true or dyna
mical theory, which takes account of momentary changes in the amount
and incidence of the acting causes, and allows for the time requisite to
enable them to work out their effects—a. distinction of the most impor
tant kind, and one which goes to exhibit all the quantitative conclusions
 deduced in this science on the other hypothesis as tentative and provi
sional.
    During the   summers      of 1826 and 1828 he took part with Mr. Airy
in a series of experiments for ascertaining the mean density of the earth,
by comparing the rates of the same pendulum in deep mines and at the
 surface.   These experiments,       made in the Dolcoath Mine, near Cam
bourne, in Cornwall, were excellently planned, and, so far as they went,
 admirably conducted ; but by a singular fatality were in both intances
 cut short in their progress, and frustrated of their result, by accidents
which could not have been foreseen and provided against—in the one
 case by the combustion in mid-air (from some cause never explained) of
 the basket containing the pendulums and other apparatus, in the act
 of raising them from the bottom of the mine to the surface—in the
 other, by the mine itself becoming deluged with water, owing to the
                    it              Treatise, p. 336, ch. ix. et seq.

   had they not occurred, the third and successful attempt made by the
   Astronomer Royal in 18541, in the Harton Coal-pit, near South Shields,
   at a greater depth, and with the immense advantage of electric commu
   nication between the clock above and the pendulum below, might never
   have been undertaken.
       In 1828 Dr. Whewell was chosen Professor of Mineralogy, as the
    uccessor of Professor Clarke, a position for which he had prepared
   himself by a residence in Germany, under the instructions of Pro
   fessor Mohs.     The subject, especially its crystallographical depart
   ment, had previously, however, attracted much of his attention, as is
                                       “ On a
   evincedby his elaborate memoir             general method of calculating
  the Angles made by any planes of Crystals,” communicated            in 1824
  to the Royal Society (of which so early as 1821 he had become a
  Fellow).     Several papers on the same department of Mineralogical
  Science were also communicated by him to the Cambridge Society in
  1822, 1827, and 1828.      This appointment, however, he held only for
  four years, and resigned it in 1832, when he was succeeded by Professor
  William Hallows Miller.
      In 1827 he became a Fellow of the Geological Society, of which, such
 was the general sense of his pro<U+FB01>ciency in that science, in 1838, he
 was elected to the of<U+FB01>ce of President.      To this Society he communi
 cated (in 18 L7) a paper on the distribution of the Scandinavian boulders.
 In the Meetings of the British Association, too, he took a lively interest,
 and was President of that body in 1841. He was the originator, or
 one of the originators of that system of Reports on the present state
 and progress of the several branches of science, which have from time
 to time been so usefully and instructiver published in their annual
 Proceedings. In 1831 we <U+FB01>nd him writing to a friend on this subject.
 “ The advice    I gave them (the managers of the York Meeting) was to
this effect: that the meeting should select eminent persons in each
 department of science, and beg them to make, by the next annual
meeting, reports as to the present condition of their respective pro
 vinces, and the points where research will apparently be most useful ;
that the purport of these reports and the degree of interest which they
may excite should be the guide and basis of future operations of the Asso
ciation, if it continue; and that, at any rate, such collection of reports,
if it can be procured, be printed—by which means their Wittenagemote
will not have met in vain.” This idea being acted on, he himself con
tributed from time to time, Reports on the Tides and on the Mathema
tical theories of Heat, Magnetism, and Electricity.
     The subject of the Tides engaged at large portion of his attention,
and gave occasion for a series of researches on the progress of the
Tide-wave     in different regions of the ocean, communicated to the

                                           lvi
Royal Society,        and printed     in their Transactions from   1833 to 1850.
His labours   on this branch of physical inquiry were distinguished in 1837
by the award of one of the Royal Medals. In point of general result,
these investigations may be considered as having afforded a clear and
satisfactory view of the Atlantic Tides, while those of the Paci<U+FB01>c (to
which only a single memoir—the 13th in order—is devoted) remain still,
in many of their features, enigmatical, and perplexed with dif<U+FB01>culties
which can only receive their elucidation from a long series of dis
 cussion carried out on the same principles, and based upon far more
 extensive observational data than he then commanded, or than we yet
possess.     One of the most curious and unexpected results of these
 inquiries is,  that there exist two points in the North Sea, one be
tween Harwich and Amsterdam, the other near the entrance to the
Baltic, in which there      no rise and fall of the tides.
                            is                               Of these points,
thus <U+FB01>rst theoretically indicated, the former has been subsequently
veri<U+FB01>ed by observation; the other does not appear to have been sought
for.
    With exception of this series of researches, his labours as         direct
                                                                        a
contributor to Physical Science may be considered as having termi
nated with his acceptance of the professorial chair of MIoral Philo
sophy (or, as    it    of<U+FB01>cially designated, of Moral Theology and Casuis
                      is
try) in 1838. The work of Paley on Moral Philosophy, in which the
basis of moral obligation        made to rest on expediency (taken in its
                                 is
largest sense,   as that  which  on the whole, and on      abroad and general
view of human relations,          most conducive to human happiness), was
                                 is
at that time the text-book followed in the University. This view of the
foundation of morals was, however, peculiarly distasteful to him, and
the whole tenor of his teaching on this subject was devoted to the expul
sion of what has been termed the utilitarian theory of morals, and the
substitution for  it  of the inward teaching of      adivinely implanted con
science, enlightened and guided by reason—obeying in this, as in his views
 of Physical Science, that strong leaning towards the Platonic or ideal
system of philosophy which refers all our knowledge, in so far as          as
                                                                            it
  umesa    regular and systematic form (as other than the recollection of
individual facts), to innate and primarily implanted conceptions coordi
nated with facts       the operation of the mind. Thus, as in geometry we
                       by
 coordinate our perceptions of the external world in accordance with our
 innate conception of Space—so, in this view of morality we coordinate our
judgment of human action, and of our own emotions and desires in refer
ence to the innate and originally implanted idea of Right assuming that
                                                               ;
its fundamental axioms and leading propositions have found their utte
rance (though hitherto imperfectly, and only in the most usual and sim
plest cases of their application) in those positive laws which regulate the
 conduct of man towards his fellows in all civilized communities.       These
 views are embodied in his sermons on the Foundation of Morals, his

                                           lvii
‘
   Elements      of Morality,’ his ‘Lectures     on the  History of Moral Philo
 sophy in      England,’   and    more especially his ‘Lectures on Systematic
             ’
 Morality      (1846). The two views are no doubt ultimately reconcileable,
or rather essentially those of one body of truth approached from dif.
ferent ends of the vista: since if it could be shown that any legitimate
conclusion as to moral duty drawn from the it priori system were in
 compatible with the production of general happiness               and wellbeing,
 such conclusion could        not  but   be  deemed   an insuperable objection to
its truth; and since the ultimate reference to the enlightenment and
 guidance of reason (as distinct from innate orinspired intuition)—if it
 have any meaning at all—can only mean a reference to what experience
teaches the general reason of mankind to expect as the probable result
 of any proposed course of action on the general happiness.               But the
 dif<U+FB01>culty is far greater to ascend to the general axioms of morality
from the facts of history and social life in the way of induction, in the
 face of so much acknowledged confusion in the results of human action
in the more complicated affairs of life, than to start from an d priori and
 divinely inspired principle of right, interfered with in its application
by the disturbing agency of passion and ignorance, in rendering an
 account of so much evil intermixed with so much good.               Nor does this
 consideration appear to have been altogether without its weight in his
 choice of a. starting-point, if we may judge from a passage in the work
 last cited (Systematic Morality, p. 133. Ch. 29 et seq)                 The just
  celebrity   of  these works,    and  of   his philosophical treatises, with his
 other eminent claims to scienti<U+FB01>c distinction, procured him the honour
 of nomination by the French Academy as a correspondent in the depart
            “
 ment of Sciences Morales et Politiques—Section de Philosophie.”
     In 1839 he retired from the tutorship of his college, devoting him
  self thenceforwards entirely to those pursuits which he felt to be more
  congenial to the natural bent of his genius and to his personal habits,
 than the practical routine of education.          What, and how expansive, and
  at the same time how de<U+FB01>nite and sober were his views on the sub
ject of the higher education in general, and of that which ought to be
  the more especial object of a. University education, may be gathered
  from a series of essays and treatises published from 1835 to 1815 on
  this subject, one of which, a brief essay entitled ‘Thoughts on the
  Study of Mathematics as a part of a liberal education’ (1835), in
  volved him in a controversy with a. very formidable antagonist (if we
  are not mistaken, the late Sir \Vm. Hamilton), who, in an elaborate
  article in the Edinburgh Review (No. 126), laboured to show that
  so far from being an essential and important means of cultivating
  “ the noblest faculties in the
                                      highest degree,” such studies effect this
             “ at best in the most
  purpose                              inadequate and precarious manner,” and
  that, in point of fact, they “have less claim to encouragement than
  any other object of education.”           Dr. Whewell, however, was quite as

                                       lviii
   strenuous an advocate for the importance of classical as of mathematical
   studies as part of a course of liberal education,  as well as for admitting,
  if not insisting on, the study of natural history and other branches of
  Natural Science as a means of developing the intellectual faculties,
  and of jurisprudence, not only for its intimate connexion with sytema
  tized morality, but as one of the best exercises in, and exempli<U+FB01>cations
  of, applied logic.                         .
     In May lSdl he published his ‘Mechanics of Engineering,’ a most
  useful and much-needed elementary treatise on the practical appli
   cation of mechanical principles to questions of construction and
  machinery.     In the summer of that year he married Cordelia, the
  second daughter of John Marshall, Esq., M.P., of Hallsteads and Pat
  terdale Hall, Cumberland, and in October of the same year succeeded
  Dr. Wordsworth in the Mastership of Trinity College, which he re
  tained during the remainder of hi life.         In this distinguished and
 important    of<U+FB01>ce  (to use the words  of one excellently quali<U+FB01>ed to judge),
 though “there were some who feared that the new Master would be
 imperious and overbearing, their fears were dissipated by the result.
 His government was, with scarcely an exception, the government of a
 constitutional monarch, not of a despot.      Of his rights and privileges he
  was tenacious enough, but he preferred to delegate the active exercise
 of his power, and its consequent responsibility, to the several college
 of<U+FB01>cers, and was best pleased when all went smoothly without reference
 to him.    He did not interpose aisi dignus vindice noduc. The Lodge
 was the scene of generous hospitality, and received a constant succes
 sion of distinguished guests." His wife, a most amiable and excellent
 lady, suffered for several years from a painful illness, during which his
 care and attention were unremitting though unavailing; and in December
 1855 he was left a widower.      From the deep grief and distaste for his
 usual philosophical pursuits, and from the melancholy associations of
 his college residence, he sought at length relief in a visit to Rome
 (resigning his Professorship of Casuistry), where, however, with charac
teristic eagerness for the continual accumulation of mental acquire
 ment, he devoted much of his time to perfecting his knowledge of the
Italian language, “taking lessons and writing exercises like the veriest
schoolboy.” Returning, and resuming his college duties, in 1858 he
married Lady Af<U+FB02>eck, widow of Sir Gilbert Af<U+FB02>eck, a lady whose sweet
disposition and engaging manners rendered her universally beloved,
and contributed not a little to the increasing popularity with which he
at length came to be regarded in the University,—the inherent dignity
and loftiness of his character, and the splendour of his reputation, now
universally recognized as adding lustre both to his college and to
the University, overcoming somewhat of a contrary feeling which, in
the earlier part of his career, had prevailed as the result of a certain
uncompromising stiffness of dcmcanour and impatience of opposition.

     In 1858                    ‘

‘

cated to the Cambridge Philosophical Society, and of a series of ‘Re
marks on Induction with reference to Mr. Mill’s Logic’ (1849)—in
part comprising several new and very striking chapters on the theolo
gical views suggested by physical discovery.
   His devotion to the Platonic view of the ideal world seemed to grow
with his growth and strengthen with his strength, and may be said to
have culminated in his Platonic Dialogues, which appeared in 1860, 1861,
and 1862, being in effect a translation of the most important portions
of Plato’s dialogues, accompanied with a kind of running comment,
explanatory of such portions as might be judged irrelevant or tedious
if translated at length—a work which he declares to have been “not
lightly executed, but the labour of many years; each part gone over
again and again.”
  In 1861 he was called     upon by His Royal Highness the Prince Con
sort to deliver, for the express instruction of the young Prince of
\Vales (then a student of Cambridge),         short course of lectures on
                                                  :1.
Political Economy. This, as we have seen, was           subject which had
                                                            a
engrcissed   large share of his attention at an earlier period, and which
               a
he never relinquished, being an ardent admirer of his distinguished co
temporary and dear friend Professor Jones (whose posthumous works he
edited), and whose volume on Rent he considered as the only work in
which that subject       treated in its most general aspect, and on truly
                           is
correct principles.    Accordingly we <U+FB01>nd in these lectures, which he
subsequently published, frequent reference to his views, and copious
extracts from the work itself.
   In 1865 he again became widower. Stern and somewhat hard as
                                    a
he may have appeared to those who knew him but imperfectly, no man
was ever more susceptible of the gentle and tender in<U+FB02>uences of female
society, or had     deeper sentiment of domestic a<U+FB01>'eetion, and this last
                       a
blow for a time completely overcame him.        By very slow degrees, and
cheered by the society of an attached relative of his former wife, he so
far recovered as to be able to resume his philosophical pursuits, and to
                                                       “ Comte and Posi
compose a short but highly interesting article on
tivism,” which appeared in MacMillan’s Magazine.        It was his last pro
duction. On the 241th February 1866, while riding         horse which had
                                                                a

was by no means a <U+FB01>rst-rate horseman, riding negligently, and, in the
present instance,    probably greatly enfeebled, and perhaps affected
by vertigo), he was observed by the ladies in      carriage, beside which
                                                        a
he rode, to have lost the command of his horse, and to be partially
unseated.    Shortly after the horse appeared without his rider, and he

                                          lx
 was taken     up senseless, having received a concussion of the brain,
 unaccompanied however by any fracture. For a time hopes were enter
 tained of his recovery, but they proved delusive.          The fatal termination
 took place March 6, 1866; and on the 10th his remains were deposited,
 with every possible honour, and with an immense attendance on the
 part of the University, in the Chapel of Trinity College, at the feet of
 the statues of Newton and Bacon (the latter his own gift to the college).
 He left no family, and as he had throughout life identi<U+FB01>ed himself
 with the University and the College in which he had won fame and
 acquired wealth, so, at his death, he devoted the bulk of the latter to
increasing their ef<U+FB01>ciency.        The particular light in which be regarded
 systematic morality      had  led  him to a careful study of the principles of
jurisprudence and of the       law  of nations, during the course of which he
had been led to publish a translation of the great work of Grotius,
 ‘
       J
   De are Belli et Pacis ;’ and justly considering that international law
as a branch of the higher education          was far too much neglected in this
 country, he provided by his will for the liberal endowment of a pro
 fessorship and studentships of that science in the University; while,
 for the future enlargement of his college, he left a large and valuable
 area of adjacent ground, purchased for the purpose during his lifetime,
 together with ample funds for building on the site.
    To the worth and nobleness of his personal character it is scarcely
 possible to do justice within the brief compass of a notice like the pre
 sent.    Those who would appreciate it <U+FB01>tly will <U+FB01>nd it admirably deli
neated, and with a truth and <U+FB01>delity which leave nothing to desire, in
the biographical notice from which one passage has been already quoted
above'.       Of his works other than scienti<U+FB01>c, a brief mention will suf
 <U+FB01>ce.    His ‘ Architectural N otcs on the German Churches,’ and ‘ Notes
 written during an Architectural Tour in Picardy and Normandy,’ have
 been pronounced standard works on ecclesiastical architecture.               The
 enumeration     of the long list of churches visited, and noted by him
 according to a regular and systematic plan of annotation, in the course
 of a summer excursion, in the former of these works, will serve to give
 some idea of the surprising activity and energy with which he threw
 himself into everything he undertook. In 1847 he edited a collection
 of English hexameters and elcgiacs by various authors, himself contri
 buting a translation from the German of Goethe’s Herman and Doro
thea.      Of the admission of these metres into our English verse he was
always a strenuous advocate, justly apprehending their many and power
ful claims to such reception, and turning a deaf ear to the prejudice
which would refuse them their merited place in our literature. He
translated also Auerbach’s ‘Professor’s Wife.’
    The essay on the ‘ Plurality of \Vorlds ’ (attributed to him, though

liberate opinion, and should rather be considered in the light of a jaw
d’esprit, or, possibly, as has been suggested, as a lighter composition,
on the principle of“ audi alteram partem,” undertaken to divert his
thoughts in a time of deep distress.     Though it may have had the

attracted the notice of Sir Thomas Liddell, and through his in<U+FB02>uence was
placed at Killingworth Colliery, to learn the practice of      coal-viewer.
                                                                        a
Here he made acquaintance with George Stephenson, who was beginning
to develope that skill and ingenuity which afterwards made him famous.
The two young men became intimate, and both worked energetically in
carrying out the plans of the inventor of the future locomotive.                 Wood
made the drawing of the <U+FB01>rst safety-lamp, and was fearless enough to
accompany Stephenson in          trial of the lamp <U+FB01>rst constructed therefrom,
                                  a
at   a “blower” in the mine.          Taking the time and circumstances into
account, this experiment must be recognized as            a  manifestation of  a   high
degree  of moral  as well  as   physical  courage     on the  part of the  two   opera
tors.   Some of Wood’s earliest scienti<U+FB01>c papers, published in local journals
about the year 1815, were on the use of the lamp in mines and on points
in the controversy which its use had originated.           In the fact that Stephen
son afterwards placed his son Robert under Wood as              a   pupil, we have   a
further proof of the con<U+FB01>dence existing between them.
   In 1825, the year of the opening of the Stockton and Darlington railway,
Mr. Wood published         ‘Treatise on Railroads,’ which, embodying what
                              a
was then known of the principles and practice of railway construction, has
passed through three editions, and          is still regarded as  a   standard work,
                   that in  the  <U+FB01>rst  edition   the   author  treats     “ ridiculous
notwithstanding                                                       as

expectations                                       sanguine enough to believe that
locomotives          could be made to run twenty miles an hour.
     In    1827   Mr. Wood     gave evidence before the Parliamentary       Committee
on the proposed railway from Liverpool to Manchester.        His opinion was
highly valued, especially on  subjects connected with coal-mining, so that in
parliamentary inquiries relating to such subjects he was usually summoned
as   a    witness.    With   agrowing reputation as geologist and mining-engineer,
be communicated,           in 1830 and 1831, to the Natural History Society of
Northumberland, Durham, and Newcastle-on-Tyne,     two papers, which were
published  in their ‘Transactions’ as valuable contributions to the then
existing knowledge of the geology and palazontology of the district. The
subject was extended and further elucidated in two papers read at the

                                        lxii
Meetings of the British Association at Newcastle in 1838 and 1863.              In
these papers the limits of the several formations—the         millstone grit, the
mountain     limestone,   and   true  coal<U+FB01>elds—are     de<U+FB01>ned,  the  courses    of
 “ dykes
          ”  are laid down, their effect on the coal-measures is pointed out,
and in the numerous sections a clear view is given of the structure of the
country.    In  the paper on “ The Vl’ash,” a remarkable denudation through
a portion ofthe coalfield of Durham, written jointly with Mr. Boyd (1863),
the e<U+FB01>'ect of a great stream in remote epochs, in producing the present
geological con<U+FB01>guration, is ably traced.
    The demands on Mr. \Vood’s time and practical skill multiplied with
 the increasing demand for coal for lighting and manufacturing               pur—
poses.    In 1844 he proposed a registration of mining Operations as im
portant   alike  <U+FB02>ow   the geological as from the commercial point of view.
He    was  a member     of the local Committee afterwards formed to draw
up a report on the best method of preventing or diminishing accidents in
coal-mines, out of which resulted the Mines' Inspection Act of 185l.            In
the following year, with a view to give effect to practical suggestions, a
scheme for a society was proposed which in August of that year took shape
as the North of England Institute of Mining Engineers, with Mr. Wood as
President.     From that time to the end of his days he     was annually elected
to the same honourable       post, and discharged the duties thereof with ad
vantage, during a period in which, besides his inaugural address, he con
tributed fourteen papers on important professional subjects to the Society's
‘
  Transactions.’     In his address, as well as on other occasions, he reiterated
his appeal for the formation of a collection of plans and records as a means
of promoting mining and geological science. These papers, with one on
 “Improvements in the Workingof Coal-Mines," communicated to the
Society of Mechanical Engineers, and published in their ‘Proceedings,’
were the latest of his writings.
    In 1844 Mr. Wood removed from Killingworth to Hetton Hall, co.
Durham, where, while health permitted, he continued his active labours
particularly in the attempt to establish a school or College “for the culti
vation, improvement, and teaching of mining science, especially as applica
ble to coal-mines.”     The attempt failed, but the discussion had a bene<U+FB01>cial
effect in attracting public attention, and in impressing the Government
with its importance.
   Mr. Wood was a member of the local societies in his neighbourhood, of
the Geological Society, of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and in 1864
was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, but did not live long to enjoy
the honour.      He had been for some years a wid0wer, when failing health
compelled him to give up the duties which he had so bene<U+FB01>cially discharged,
and to resort for medical advice to London, where he died December 19,
1865, leaving four sons and two daughters.        He was characterized through
out life by a. calmness of temper which nothing disturbed; and one who
knew him well has recorded concerning him, that, “ whether he be viewed

                                           1xiii
 as an employer    of labour, as a successful man of business, as a promoter
 of knowledge, as a friend to education among all classes, as a neighbour, a
 parent, ora friend, we may safely say that his place in society will not easily
 be <U+FB01>lled.”
     Joan, Loan Waorrasu-zv,      was born on the 5th ofAngust 1798.    His
 father, the <U+FB01>rst peer, was the representative of a family which was of dis
 tinction when it acquired the estate of Wrottesley, near Wolverhampton,
 at a date which may be best remembered by the fact that the fourth pos
 sessor, and the third who took his name from        it,
                                               was made    Knight of the
                                                                    a
 Garter at the institution       of the order. The subject of our memoir gra
 duated at Oxford with       a   <U+FB01>rst class in mathematics, and was called to the
bar, at which he practised for several years as an equity lawyer. His
tastes were scienti<U+FB01>c.   He showed them when he joined the Society
for the Diffusion of Useful  Knowledge, in the Committee of which he
worked during the whole existence of the body   in its earliest days he
                                                       :
wrote   number of the Useful Knowledge Library, on navigation.
          a                                                          In
 1831    he became one of the Secretaries of the Astronomical Society, of
which he        was afterwards President
                                     (1841—43).    He became President of
the Royal Society in  1854,  on the retirement of Lord Rosse, and held this
post until 1858.    He died Oct. 27, 1867, aged sixty-nine.    No life was
more devoid of striking incidents than his: the only exceptions to its even
tenour were the loss of two worthy sons, one of whom fell in action at the
 Cape, the other at Bomarsund.
   His characteristics, says journal obituary, were plain manners, kind feel
                                 a
ings, sound judgment, and useful intellect. His knowledge of 1aw,his pursuit
of   science,    and his conduct of life were equally practical and equally unob
trusive.        His particular pursuit was astronomy, which he carried on in two
small observatories, one at Blackheath, while he was engaged at the bar, the
other at Wrottesley, after his accession to the title in 1841.   In 1839 he
received the gold medal of the Astronomical Society for        catalogue of
                                                                    a
stars.  This work was performed by himself with the aid of Mr. Hartnup,
now at the head of the Liverpool Observatory, whom he trained as his
assistant. The object of   was to make systematic observations of the
                                 it
right ascensions of all the stars of the Astronomical Society’s Catalogue,
of the sixth and seventh magnitudes; the higher magnitudes having been
u’ndertaken, or rather having been supposed to have been undertaken,                 by
other observatories.   Comparison with various cases obtained from public
observatories showed that hIr. \Vrottesley’s catalogue was, as  was styled
                                                                        it
by Mr. Baily in delivering the medal, of <U+FB01>rst-rate importance and entitled
to implicit con<U+FB01>dence.
   Lord Wrottesley also communicated two astronomical papers to the
Royal Society—one, “ On the Results of Periodical Observations of the
Positions       and Distances of certain Double Stars,”    published    in   the Philo
sophical      Transactions   for 1851; the other, which     was   published     in the

                                         lxiv
 “               ”                         “ On
    Proceedings     for 1859,is entitled        the Application of the Calculus
 of Probabilities to the results of Measures of the Position and Distance of
 Double Stars.”
    During the four years of his presidency of the Royal Society, Lord
 Wrottesley was unremitting in his attendance at the meetings of Council,
 and his conduct of business was guided throughout by the clearness of
 insight and rectitude of judgment which belonged to his mental character.
 Among the various subjects which came under his consideration during
 this period, there was one in which he may be said to have taken a special
interest; the question, namely, whether any measures could be adopted by
the Government or by Parliamentwhich would improve the position of science
 and its cultivators in this country.       The subject was brought under the
 consideration of the Parliamentary Committee of the British Association,
of which Lord Wrottesley was Chairman; and the Committee, after cor
responding with eminent men of science and learning their views on the
question, presented a Report to the Meeting of the Association at Glasgow
in 1855. In the following summer a motion was made in the House of
Commons, by Mr. James Heywood, for a Select Committee to inquire into
this question, which was, after some discussion, withdrawn, in order, as it was
understood, to allow the matter to be previously considered by scienti<U+FB01>c men.
On this, Lord Wrottesley, without loss of time, brought the matter before
the Council of the Royal Society, who referred it in the <U+FB01>rst instance to
the Committee who assisted them in the distribution             of the Govern
ment grant, and <U+FB01>nally adopted a series of resolutions which were com
municated to Lord Palmerston,then First Lord of the Treasury: but a
change of Government and a dissolution of Parliament having soon after
wards taken place, the matter was not again brought before the Legisla
ture.    Both as Chairman of the. Parliamentary Committee of the British
Association and as President of the Royal Society, Lord Wrottesley con
ducted the correspondence relating        to this question,  and took the chief
share in drawing up the Reports.
    Lord Wrottesley was President of the British Association at its Meeting
in Oxford in 1860, and in his Address delivered on that occasion, he
earnestly recommended due encouragement of the Physical and Natural
Sciences as branches of University study.        On a later occasion, in a speech
delivered in the House of Lords in 1865, on the Public Schools Bill, he
strongly urged the expediency of introducing science as an important branch
of school teaching.
   ALEXANDER DALLAS Bacna, For. Memb. R.S., was a son of Richar
Bachc, one of the several children       of the only daughter of Dr. Benjamin
Franklin.     His mother was Sophia Dallas, the daughter of Alexander J.
Dallas, and sister of George M. Dallas, whose names are well known in the
history of the United States, the former as Secretary of the Treasury, and
the latter as Vice-President of the United States, and subsequently as

                                             lxv
    Minister at the Court of St. James’s.        He was born in Philadelphia, on the
    19th  of July,  l906.   At  an early age  he became a pupil of a classical school
    of celebrity, and was distinguished by unusual aptitude in the acquisition
    of learning. Shortly before arriving at the age of <U+FB01>fteen, he was appointed
   a cadet of the Military Academy at \Vest Point, and graduated in 1825 at
   the head of his class.
       After graduating, he was selected to remain in the Academy as an
   Assistant   Professor, and in this position, which gave him an opportunity
   of  reviewing his studies and examining his reading, he continued one year,
   when at his own request he was assigned to engineering duty at Newport,
   R.I. Here he remained two years, engaged in constructing forti<U+FB01>cations,
   and devoting his extra hours to the study of Physics and Chemistry; and
   supported his mother and her younger children out of his stinted pay as
   Lieutenant of Engineers.         An unexpected change now took place in his
  circumstances, which enabled him to marry.             He was appointed to the
   Professorship of Natural Philosophy and Chemistry in the University of
   Pennsylvania,   at Philadelphia.     Having had, prior to this, some experience
  as a teacher, he soon gained the entire con<U+FB01>dence        of the authorities of the
  University    and  the affections  of his pupils.   He became   a member of the
  Franklin Institute, a Society then newly established for the promotion of
  the Mechanical Arts.         This Society was well calculated to exhibit his
  talents and develope his character.         It brought him into intimate associa
  tion with the principal manufacturers, engineers, and artisans of the city.
  Facilities were thus a<U+FB01>'orded him for the prosecution of science which he
  could nothave commanded in anyother way. Workshops were thrown open to
 him, and skilful hands o<U+FB01>'ered ready assistance in realizing the conceptions
 of   his suggestive mind.       His descent from the illustrious Statesman and
 Philosopher, whose name the Institution bears, contributed in some de
 gree no doubt to the in<U+FB02>uence which he acquired ; but it was in the main
 to his own industry, ability, and courtesy that he owed the favour' and
distinction which, in assigning to him the principal directorship of scienti<U+FB01>c
 investigations, afforded him the means of so greatly contributing to the
usefulness of the Society, and of advancing his own reputation. An account
of the labours in which he was engaged in his connexion with the Franklin
Institute will be found in the volumes of its Journal from 1826 to 1835
inclusive.      The results of his investigations relating to the bursting of
steam-boilers, after a lapse of more than thirty years, have not yet been
superseded by any others of more practical value.               These experiments
were attended with no small amount of danger, and required in their
execution no small amount of personal courage.
     He erected an Observatory in the yard of his own house, in which, with
the aid of his wife and his friend and former pupil, John Fraser, be deter
mined with accuracy, for the <U+FB01>rst time in the United States, the periods of
the daily variations of the magnetic needle, and in another series of obser
vations the connexion of the <U+FB01>tful variations of the direction of the
     VOL. XVI.                                                          f

magnetic force with the appearance of the Aurora Borealis.              He also, in
connexion with Mr. Espy, made a minute survey of the relative change of
position of the trees and other         objects in the track of a tornado which
passed over New Brunswick.             In   connexion with Professor Courtenay he
also made a series of determinations          of the magnetic dip at various places
in the United States.           Indeed, terrestrial magnetism was with him a
favourite subject, to which he continued to make valuable contributions at
intervals during his whole life.             He was also much interested in the
phenomena      of   heat,  and    was   the   <U+FB01>rst to show, contrary to generally
received opinion,     that  the    radiation    and consequent absorption ‘of dark
heat is not affected by colour.
     In 1836, when Professor Bache had just attained the thirtieth year of
 his age, the Trustees of the Girard College, an institution muni<U+FB01>cently
 endowed by a benevolent citizen of Philadelphia, preparatory to organizing
 the College, resolved to select Professor Bache as the most proper man for
 the of<U+FB01>ce of President, and to send him abroad to study the systems of
 education and methods         of instruction and discipline adopted in Europe.
 It  was with dif<U+FB01>culty that he could bring himself to regard with favour a
 preposition which threatened to separate him from the pursuit of science.
 The consideration      of a more extended <U+FB01>eld of usefulness at length pre
 vailed, and he accepted the proffered position, though not without some
 lingering regret. No American ever visited Europe under more favourable
 circumstances     for becoming intimately acquainted with its scienti<U+FB01>c and
 literary institutions.     His published researches had made him favourably
 known to the cultivators of science, and gave him ready access to intclli
 gent and in<U+FB02>uential society.        He remained in Europe two years, and on his
  return embodied the results of his researches on Education in his Report
  to the Trustees of Girard College.          This Report is an almost exhaustive
  exposition of the systems of education and methods of instruction in use at
  the time in England, France, Prussia, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy.
  The accounts which are given of the different schools of Europe are
  founded on personal inspection, the results being noted down at the time
  with his habitual regard for accuracy.
      After completing his report he was prepared to commence the organiza
  tion of the College, but the Trustees, partly on account of the un<U+FB01>nished
   condition of the building, and partly from a want of the <U+FB01>nal adjustment
   of the funds, were not disposed to put the Institution into operation.         In
   the  meantime,    Professor   Bachc,    desirous of rendering  the information he
   had acquired of immediate practical use offered his services gratuitously to
   the municipal authorities of Philadelphia to organize on an improved basis
   a system of public education for that city. This offer was readily accepted ;
   and he commenced the work with his usual energy, and with the cordial
   support of the Directors and Teachers of the common schools.            The result
   of his labours was the establishment of the best system of combined free
   education which had at that time been adopted in the United States.

                                          lxvii
   In 1842, having completed the organization of the schools, and <U+FB01>nding
that the Trustees of the College were still unprepared to open the Institu
tion, he resigned all connexion with           it,
                                         and yielded to the solicitations ot'
the Trustees       of the University
                                  to return to his former chair of Natural
Philosophy and Chemistry.       During his travels in Europe he provided
himself with portable instruments, and made         series of observations on
                                                          a
the dip and intensity of terrestrial magnetism at prominent points on the
Continent and in Great Britain, with the view of ascertaining the relative
intensity of the magnetic force in Europe and America.        The observations
also served in most instances to settle with greater precision the magnetic
condition of the points at which they were made.          In the midst of the
labour of organizing the schools of Philadelpha he cooperated actively
with the British Association in determining the <U+FB02>uctuations of the magnetic
and meteorological elements of the globe             by
                                               contemporaneous observations
at places widely separated from each other. He established an Observatory,
which was furnished with      complete series of the best instruments
                               a                                            the    by
Girard College, and was supported             by
                                         the American Philosophical Society,
and a   number of liberal and intelligent individuals.       The observations,
which were continued    at short intervals day and night for <U+FB01>ve years, form
a rich mine from which, until within the last few years of his life, he drew            a
highly interesting series of results without exhausting the material.        In
addition   to these     observations,   he made during his        summer    vacations   a
magnetic survey of Pennsylvania.
  In   November      1843, on the occasion of the death of        Mr.   Hassler, he was
called to take charge of the United States Coast Survey.        Though he
undertook the task with many misgivings,        may be truly said that no
                                                      it
otherliving man was so well quali<U+FB01>ed to secure the results which the nation
and its commercial interests demanded.        His education at West Point, his
skill in original investigations, his thorough familiarity with applied science,
his knowledge of the world and his gentlemanly deportment were all essen
tial elements in the successful prosecution of the Survey.        Besides these
quali<U+FB01>cations he possessed rare executive ability, and governed and guided
the diverse elements of the vast undertaking with consummate tact and skill.
Quick to perceive and acknowledge merit in others, he rapidly gathered
around him   corps of men eminently well quali<U+FB01>ed for the execution of
               a
the tasks to which he severally assigned them.   Up to the time of' the
appointment of Professor Bache little more than beginning of the Survey
                                                              a
had been made.         It
                    extended only as far from New York harbour as Point
Judith on the east coast, and southward to Cape Henlopen.      The new
Superintendent saw the necessity of greatly enlarging the plan so as to
embrace    much broader <U+FB01>eld than
           a                        had previously included.
                                         it                  He divided
the whole coast-line into sections, and instituted under separate parties the
essential operations of the Survey simultaneously in each.    He commenced
the exploration of the  Gulf-stream, and at the same time projected     series a
                                                                         f2

                                       lxviii
  of observations on the tides, also of the magnetism of the earth, and the
 direction of the wind at di<U+FB01>‘erent seasons of the year.   He also instituted a
 succession of researches in regard to the bottom of   the  ocean within sound
 ings, and the forms of animal life which are found there, thus offering new
 and unexpected indications to the navigator.     He pressed the electric tele
 graph into the service for the determination of the longitude, photography
 for the ready reproduction of charts, and the art of electrotyping for multi
 plying copperplate engraving.     Professor Bache, with his enlightened appre
 ciation of the value of abstract science, kept constantly in view the various
 problems relative to the physics of the globe which were incidentally con
 nected with the survey of the coast, and ever cherished the hope of being
 permitted to <U+FB01>nish his labours by their solution.    Among these was a new
 determination of the magnitude and form of the earth, the variations in
 the intensity of gravity at various points on the continent of North Ame
 rica, the discussion of the general theory of the tides, the magnetic
 condition of the continent, and the improvement of the general map of
 the United States by determining in relation to the coast-line, the geogra
 phical positions of the most important points in the interior.
    He was Superintendent of Weights and Measures, and rendered im
 portant services as a Member of a Commission to examine the condition of
the Light Home System.        In 1846 he was named one of the Regents of
the Smithsonian     Institution,  and by successive reelection‘was continued
in this o<U+FB01>ice until his death.    At the request of the Governor of Pennsyl
vania, although overwhelmed with other public labours, he planned a line
of defences for Philadelphia, and to a considerable extent personally super
intended their construction.     This work proved too much for his strength,
and brought on the malady which terminated his life.
    After some premonitory symptoms, which, however, did not diminish his
exertions, he was suddenly deprived in a considerable degree of the power
of locomotion, and of the expression of his ideas.      For several months he
was very anxious about the business of the Coast Survey, and it was with
dif<U+FB01>culty that he could .be restrained from resuming the full duties of his
of<U+FB01>ce.    It was hoped that a voyage to Europe would be of service to him;
the journey, however, was productive of no permanent advantage ; and after
lingering for more than two years, he departed this life on the 17th of
February 1867.
    But few Americans have been more highly honoured at home or more
appreciated abroad.       He was President of the American Philosophical
Society, of the American Association for the Advancement of Science,
and of the National Academy of Sciences lately established by Congress.
He was a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the
Royal Irish Academy, the Royal Astronomical Society, a Corresponding
Member of the Imperial Institute of France, of the Imperial Academy of
St. Petersburg, of the Royal Academy of Turin, of the Institute of

                                       lxix
Bologna, of the Royal and Imperial Geographical Society of Vienna, and
the Mathematical Society of Hamburg.          He was elected a Foreign Mem
ber of the Royal Society in 1860.
    The preceding notice has been extracted from a manuscript       memoir of
Professor Bache kindly supplied by Dr. Joseph Henry.
    Geoao FRIEDRICH BERNHARD RXEMANN was born on the l7th of Sep
tember 1826 at the village of Breselenz, near Dannenberg, in Hanover.      He
was the second of six children born to the Pastor of Breselenz.     Under his
father’s sole tuition till eight years of age, he exhibited great powers of
arithmetical calculation.     An able tutor, who from this time assisted in
teaching him, was forced to make unusual exertions in order to follow the
short and original solutions of the problems proposed to his pupil.
    In the spring of 1840 Riemann was sent to the Lyceum in IIanoaer,
where he remained two years.        He was then placed in the Gymnasium of
Liineburg under Director Schmalfuss.         The latter soon discovered Rie-‘
mann’s     mathematical talent, and not only gave him problems made
expressly for him during school hours, but lent him works on the higher
mathematical subjects, which he brought back after having thoroughly
mastered them in the course of a few days.          A week sufficed to make
Legendre’s theory of numbers his own for life.
    He entered the University of Gottingen at Easter 1846, by his father’s
wish, as a student of theology.      Here the lectures of Gauss stirred up in
him such    a passion for exact science that he sought and obtained permis
sion from his father to devote himself entirely to the studies of his choice.
For two years, commencing with Easter 184 7, he studied under Jacobi at
Berlin. He then returned to Gottingen, and graduated, his dissertation
on the foundations ofa general theory of functions of a variable complex
magnitude obtaining the warm approval of Gauss.
    In 1854 he quali<U+FB01>ed for the post of a teacher by a lecture on the hypo
theses on which geometry is founded, and by writing a memoir on the re
presentation of a function by a trigonometric series.     In September of the
same year he wrote on the distribution of electricity in non-conductors.
 In 1855 he contributed to Poggendor<U+FB02>" s ‘ Annalen ’ a paper on the theory
of Nobili’s coloured rings, and one on the mathematical theory of the gal
vanic current.     During the two following years he suffered much from
 failing health.
    In 1857 he became Professor Extraordinarius, and wrote four papers
which appeared in vol. liv. of Crelle’s Journal.      In 1859 he was elected
 a Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences of Berlin, and con
 tributed to the ‘ Abhandlungen’ of the Academy a memoir on the num
ber of primes below a given number, and was nominated Professor Ordi
 narius.   In l860 he was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences of
 Gb'ttingen, and in the course of this and the following year wrote a me
 muir on the propagation     of plane waves of <U+FB01>nite amplitude in air, and one

                                          but
on the motion of a <U+FB02>uid homogeneous ellipsoid. These two memoirs were
                                               ‘              ’
printed in the eighth and ninth volumes of the   Abhandluugen   of the
Society.
  Riemann married in 1562.      In July of the same year he suffered from
an attack of pleurisy.   Through the good o<U+FB02>ices of Professors “’eber and
v.\Valtershausen    he obtained leave of absence and pecuniary assistance
from a fund available for such purposes, to enable him to travel in Italy.
He quitted Go'ttingen in November and passed the winter in Messina. His
health in some degree restored, he left Messina in March 1863, on his
homeward journey, stopping in Palermo, Naples, Rome, Pisa, Florence, and
Milan, and making the acquaintance of the most distinguished men of
science  of Italy. He arrived in Gettingen in July, suffering from a re
lapse caused by exposure to cold in crossing the Spliigen.   In the following
August   he  entered upon his second  journey to Italy.    The Professorship
at Pisa, vacant by the death of Mosotti, was offered to him at the sugges
tion of Professor Betti, but declined by the advice of Riemann’s friends on
account of the state of his health.    He passed two successive winters in
Pisa.         In
          the autumn of 1865 he returned to Giittingen, and began to
write  paper on the mechanism of the ear, which was published after his
          a
death by Professors Henle and Schering.    He entrusted the completion
ofa paper on the surface of least area, having a given boundary, to Dr.
Hattcndorff. This paper is printed in vol. xiii. of the ‘ Abhandlungen ’ of
the Society of Gettingen.   Desirous of passing some months on the shores
of the Logo Maggiore in order to collect strength suf<U+FB01>cient to enable him
to complete his un<U+FB01>nished works, he left Gottingen on the 16th of June
1866, and after some delay, caused by the events of the war, reached
Lago Maggiore on the 23rd of the same month.
   Perfectly conscious of his approaching end, and fully prepared for    heit,
repeatedly urged his physician to tell him how long he had to live, in order
that he might thereby be guided       the selection of labour that
                                      in                a             might
                                                                      it
be possible for him to complete.       He died in entire possession of his
faculties on the 20th of     July   1866, at Selasca,
                                                near Intra, on the Lago
Maggiore,          only the day before worked on the mechanism of the
                   having
organs of hearing, whilst he warned his attendants that his death was at
hand.
   He    gratefully remembered
          is                         by
                                   his pupils for his liberality in

to them the results of known, new and important unpublished researches,
and for the unwearied zeal with which he strove to impress upon them the
whole truth of his lessons.

    Sra   EDMUND WALKER HEAD was born at Wiarton Place, Kent,
 February 16, 1805. His ancestor, created a baronet in 1676, resided at
 the hermitage near Rochester, in Kent; and his seat is said to have af
 forded shelter to James the Second during the memorable week of December
  1688, the last which he spent in England.        The grandfather of the sub
ject of our memoir, Sir Edmund, emigrated to America, and settled at
 Charleston.     In the War of Independence he took the Royalist side, lost
 the greater part of his fortune, and returned to England, bringing with
 him his son, afterwards Sir John.      This portion of the family history was
 much noted in Canada and in New Brunswick when the descendant and
namesake of this Sir Edmund went to administer the government of those
 provinces, in both of which there are many families descended from the
 “loyalists” of the last century.
    Sir John became a clergyman, and had by his wife, Miss Walker, two
 children, Sir Edmund and Annette, wife of the Baron de Milanges.            He
 died in 1838.
    Edmund     was sent to Winchester in 1815, where he became, through his
 rapid pro<U+FB01>ciency, a very favourite pupil of Dr. Gabell, the then head
 master.    “It is hard,” writes the Doctor to Sir John, in 1822, “ to part
 with so delightful a boy; but there is virtue in parting with him: pray
 do not detain him beyond the proper time.”          He entered Oriel College,
 Oxford, as a gentleman commoner in January 1824, was <U+FB01>rst class in
 classics 1827, and elected to a fellowship of Merton.
    Thus introduced into the academical world of his day, Edmund Head
 became familiar, and continued so through his life, with many of the
leading men of that remarkable time for Oxford, and especially for Oriel :
the two Newmans,       the three Wilberforces, Froude, Manning, W rangham,
Edward     Villiers, Denison,  the Bishop of Salisbury were all more or less
nearly his cotemporaries, and members of his Oxford circle.          But of the
friendships which he formed at that place, the most lasting, and in its con
sequences to himself the most important, was with George Cornewall Lewis,
then student of Christ Church.        No two men could be more singularly
<U+FB01>tted to love and esteem      each  other, and, in a certain   sense, to supply
each other’s de<U+FB01>ciencies.     Both were strongly addicted to the study of the
past ; but Lewis more in relation to antiquities and politics, Head especially
in the province of history and art. Both were classical scholars of mark——
 Lewis, no doubt, with far more of industry and research, Head with at
least equal elegance.     Both were early engaged in the same line of political
and social speculations; and in both liberal tendencies were accompanied
by the same singular candour and modesty of judgment.              Some of the
epitaph, so to speak, composed by Sir Edmund for his predeceased friend,
in his preface to ‘ Lewis’s collected Essays on the Administration of Great
Britain’ (1861), seems, to those who knew and valued them both, to
    von. xvr.                                                       g

                                           lxxii
illustrate his own character almost as much           as that of the subject of his
panegyric.
                 “ He   rarely  formed   an  opinion  without  looking at all sides of
the question before        him,    or  without   having   recourse   to all accessible
 sources of information, which few men knew so well where to seek as he
 himself did.      He was deluded by no prejudices, and jumped to no con~
 clusions without testing them by the application of sound common sense.
 When he had thus formed an opinion, be adhered to it steadily, but not
 obstinately.     He was ever open to argument, and he never refused to listen
 to it because it con<U+FB02>icted with his own view of the case.             He had none or
 those    crotchets   or fancies lurking in his mind which         so often   taint the
 reasoning.”
    The classical accomplishments of Sir Edmund’s early years he retained
 through life, though multiplicity of business on the one hand, and the pre
 valence in his mind of other tastes, especially for art, on the other, pre—
 vented him from “ keeping          up”   his classics as sedulously as some other
 politicians of his generation       have done.     But the readiness with which he
 could apply his early knowledge was often displayed—never                more neatly
 than in the prefatory quotation which he furnished to Professor Tyndall
 for his paper on Calorescence (Phil. Trans, Read Nov. 23, 1865).

    “I   am   indebted    to my excellent friend Sir Edmund Head,” says the
eminent Professor,       “ for this extract, which reads like divination.”
    Not long after his election to hierton in the year 1830-31, Sir Edmund
travelled over most part of Spain in company with David Roberts the
artist, then engaged in making drawings for his work on that country.
Three of the plates in that work, namely the view of Ronda, of the viaduct
at Segovia, and the bridge at Toledo, are from his sketches.                 It was on
this occasion that he made acquaintance with Richard Ford (then resi
                                                                       ‘
ding at Seville), the accomplished and genial author of the Handbook for
Spain,’ which ripened into a durable intimacy.
    Sir Edmund brought back from his tour in Spain, and also in Italy, an
 increased devotion to the pursuits of what was formerly termed a “vir
 tuoso,” fondness for art, and familiarity with its history and specialties,
 especially the art of painting.           The second part of Kngler’s ‘ Hand
 book of Painting,’ published in English by Murray, that which relates to
the German, French, and Dutch schools, was edited by him.                   The third
part (Spanish and French schools, published             as a separate work in 1848)
 is his composition.
    It  was his intention,    on leaving Oxford, to follow the civil law as a pro

                                            lxxiii
   fession;     but his scheme of life was altered         through   his intimacy  with
   Lewis, whose father, Sir Frankland, was at the head of the Poor Law
   Board.      Through the son’s in<U+FB02>uence, Head became Assistant Poor Law
   Commissioner in 1836.           He organized the unions in Herefordshire, the
   district assigned to him.       It was on that occasion that he made the acquaint
  ance    of the lady who became his wife, Anna Maria, third daughter of the
  Rev. Philip Yorke.          They were married in 1838. In the same year the
  baronetcy devolved on him by the death of his father.                The issue of the
  marriage were three children—a son, accidentally drowned in Canada, and
  two daughters, surviving.
      From Herefordshire         he was transferred to the London district, and in
  1841,    on    the resignation of Sir John Lefevre, became one of the chief
  Commissioners, with his friend Lewis and Sir George Nicholl.                This me
  moir does not a<U+FB01>'ord an occasion for recurring to the accusations and Par
  liamentary discussions, with which, indeed, Sir Edmund had personally
 little to do, which produced the disruption of that Board in 1847. It was
  reconstituted by Act of Parliament in that year under a new organization;
  but Lewis and Head were not included in the latter.
      In 1847 Sir Edmund was appointed Lieutenant-Governor                     of New
  Brunswick by Lord Grey, then Secretary for the Colonies.                The period of
  his appointment coincided with that of a great constitutional change in the
 government of the dependencies of Great Britain, the introduction of what
 is called    “   responsible government.”       Canada was already undergoing the
 transition      to the new state of things under the able management of the
 Earl of Elgin. New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were the next subjects of
 experiment.          Although the <U+FB01>eld of action thus a<U+FB01>'orded to Sir Edmund
 was     but  a   small one,  it was  one which    taxed the abilities and the temper
 of the administrator         to the full extent.     He occupied a post exposed to
 attack, on the one side, from colonial politicians who were bent on push
 ing their newly gained independence to excess, and British members of
 Parliament and politicians on the other, who could not for a long time be
 brought to comprehend the nature of the gift which they had bestowed,
 nor why a colony, having achieved the right to conduct its own a<U+FB02>'airs, was
 to be allowed to conduct them in a way which they disliked.                 And many
 points of serious difference were long left unsettled—the              management of
 the public laws, the disposal of the reserved revenue, then called the “ civil
list,” the embarrassing question of the initiation of money votes by the
local government instead of at the caprice of individual members.               During
seven years        of government in New Brunswick Sir Edmund Head contrived
so far to smooth away these causes of differences, that few portions of the
British empire have been better or more quietly governed than that which
he conducted through this <U+FB01>rst stage of self-government.               Cautious almost
to excess,      entirely free from that self-importance which induces colonial
governors       at  times to forget that the maxim of “ reigning and not govern.
                                                                         g  2

                                         lxxiv
 ing”    is to be carefully followed except in peculiar emergences, be united
 with these qualities    a very conscientious loyalty to those with whom he
 was placed in contact.     To let every project which he initiated be thoroughly
 known beforehand to his local advisers on the one hand, and to his supe
 riors in o<U+FB01>ice at home on the other, was with          him a fundamental rule of
 conduct.     And the result  was, that, though    often opposed on the one hand
 and sometimes overruled        on the other,     he was always and thoroughly
 trusted.
    The monotony of colonial life in a remote and thinly peopled province was
 diversi<U+FB01>ed, for Sir Edmund Head, by a strong love of nature and attach»
 ment to outdoor pursuits.       He had a taste for geology, and induced the
legislature of New Brunswick to employ Professor Johnston to survey the
 province, and publish a report on its agricultural capabilities based on its
 geological formation—a work of considerable local value.           In later years
 he took great interest in the geological survey of Canada, accompanied Sir
 William Logan in his <U+FB01>eld operations, and took part in many a discus
 sion on the mysteries of the “Laurentian strata.”            And besides his ad
 diction   to landscape-art   and the picturesque, he was, moreover, a very
 eager   and accomplished     sportsman.      Some of his happiest intervals of
 busy life were spent in the wild backwoods of New Brunswick, with Lady
 Head for his companion, geologizing, sketching, <U+FB01>shing, and shooting,
 until the close of the late Indian summer called them back to of<U+FB01>cial em
 ployment.
    In September 1854 Sir Edmund Head was promoted to the o<U+FB01>ice of
 Governor of Canada and Govemor-General of British North America, on
 the resignation of Lord Elgin.        In this instance Lord Elgin had laid the
 foundation of that system of government which was afterwards adminis
 tered by Sir Edmund.       But the period of his administration was signalized
 by serious dif<U+FB01>culties and important changes.
    Not long after his assumption of the Government of Canada the Russian
war broke out (1854—56).          It will be in the recollection of those who
 watched the events of that anxious period into what embarrassment this
 country was for a time thrown by the dif<U+FB01>culty of obtaining soldiers for
our immediate demand, and how greatly that embarrassment was increased
by the apprehension on that subject, amounting to a panic, which took
possession of the public mind.           VVell-meaning but over-zealous agents
suggested,    and attempted,   the  levy  of recruits among British subjects, not
only   in   our American    colonies,   but  in the United States.     Rightly or
wrongly, the jealous spirit of our kindred of the Republic was aroused by
the proposal, and by the very slight attempts which were made to carry it
into execution.     Sir Edmund Head, accustomed as he was to dealing
with the Americans,     saw at once its extreme      danger and checked it imme
diately, at all hazards to his own popularity,       along the precarious line of
boundary between his colony and the States.

                                            lxxv
     “ I am not in the habit of
                                      boasting,” he  says in a private letter of this
  date;    “  nor do I pretend to have foreseen all the consequences; but I sin
 cerely believe that if I had given in to some of the recruiting schemes, and
 had thus generated a hostile feeling at Buffalo and along the frontier, war
 would      have been   upon us before this time.”        The danger was averted;
 and Sir Edmund employed himselfin promoting the more worthy plan of
 raising troops openly in Canada itself.         This was accomplished, or at least
 initiated, by the levy of the “ hundredth,” or “ Canadian
                                                                  ”
                                                                    regiment.    But
 the termination of hostilities rendered its services unnecessary.           It was a
 strong proof, however, of the popularity of the measure in the colony, that
 Sir Edward received between two and three hundred applications for o<U+FB02>icers’
 commissions.
     The next question which engaged Sir Edmund Head’s serious attention
 was one of magnitude in itself, but rendered more di<U+FB01>icult by the amount
 of local interests and rivalries which were engaged in it. Upper and
 Lower Canada had        been   united into a single province, some years before,
under the administration         of the colonies by Lord John Russell.        But no
 decision was arrived at respecting the permanent seat of the future govern
ment.        Since the union, therefore, the executive had been located, in alter
nate years, at Quebec and at Toronto—a change attended with much in
convenience to the public service.          But to <U+FB01>x on a single capital was a de
cision which the local ministries shrank from taking, naturally fearful, as
they were, of encountering the hostility of the rejected candidates.            They
therefore acquiesced in the course advised by Sir Edmund Head, of referring
the question to the decision of the Queen, and praying her Majesty to se_
lect the site of their eventual metropolis.         But the corporations of all the
towns, which conceived themselves to have a claim to this honour and ad—
vantage, were to be <U+FB01>rst admitted to urge their respective claims.           Accord
ingly, in the course of 1857, Quebec, Toronto, Montreal, Kingston, Ottawa,
and Hamilton gave in their several memorials, showing their respective ad
vantages in point of population, commerce, position, and capabilities of
defence; and the case in behalf of each was urged with considerable abi
lity.     Sir Edmund Head’s Opinion was in favour of Ottawa; and that
place was ultimately selected by the Queen in the Ministry of Lord Pal
merston, but not without much careful investigation.             The dif<U+FB01>culties of
the question, however,        did not cease here.      The youthful democracy of
Canada were not easy          to hold    fast; and  a considerable  disposition was
manifested to repudiate the decision which the Crown had taken on the
invitation of the colonial authorities themselves.            This opposition was
surmounted,       however, through the patience and tact of the Governor, as
well    as   the general good sense of the community, and the conviction
that    (independently of the binding engagement into which they had
entered       towards  the   Crown)     the problem was really soluble in no
other way.        Ottawa,   situated   on the frontier between the two ancient

  provinces, became the capital of the colony, and is now that of the con
  federatcd “ dominion.”
     In the same year, and in the conduct of those negotiations, Sir Edmund
  Head visited England, and was appointed of the Privy Council.

     In 1860 occurred the “ progress                 Royal Highness the Prince of
  Wales   through British        North  America.       The  Governor-General       met
  the royal party at Gaspé, at the mouth of the St. Lawrence, and accompa
  nied them in their lengthened tour through his province.               Shortly after
  this he paid a visit to England, on which occasion he was made a Knight
  Commander      of the Bath.
     The last business of public importance in which Sir Edmund was en
  gaged in Canada related to the confederation of the British North-American
 provinces.     The movement towards the attainment of this object originated
 in Canada.      By the terms of the union between the two divisions of that
 province, Canada East and Canada West had an equal voice in the pro
  ceedings of the legislature.     But the latter division was rapidly outgrow
 ing the former in population and wealth.             The result was a collision of
 interests which     tended to a deadlock     in the Government—the         reforming
 party in the \Vest advancing the principle         of representation    according to
  numbers, the East clinging to that equality which the existing constitution
 secured to it.     To obtain the union of the so-called Lower Previnees (Nova
  Scotia, New     Brunswick, Newfoundland,         Prince Edward’s      Island) with
  Canada, and thus to recast the entire political arrangement, was an obvious
 expedient for getting rid of the dif<U+FB01>culty. Other motives concurred, but
 this was the principal; and in 1858 delegates from Canada waited on Sir
 Edward Lytton, then Colonial Minister, in order to urge it. The Governor
 General, though sincerely anxious to promote the scheme, thoughtit of the
 utmost importance that the initiative should be taken by the communities
 themselves and not by the executive, and therefore con<U+FB01>ned himself to
 the exercise of his      good of<U+FB01>ces in removing all dif<U+FB01>culties in the way of
 the negotiation.      Personally, he was of opinion that the best course would
 be to effect a union between between the Lower Provinces <U+FB01>rst, and then
 to connect the newly-consolidated dominion with Canada.                 But circum
stances rendered it impossible to proceed in that direction.               The whole
project,   however,     was adjourned  for  some   time;  nor was  it  practically re
vived until after the departure of Sir Edmund from Canada, which took
place in 186] . It was <U+FB01>nally carried into execution under the government
of his successor, Lord Monk.
    From the position which he had held in the University of Oxford and
his taste for literary pursuits, it might have been expected that Sir Edmund
should pay attention to the promotion of education and the extension of
science in the provinces which he was called on to govern ; and the sequel
shows that he successfully exerted his influence to further           these objects,
both in New Brunswick and Canada.

if
                                        lxxvii
    In New Brunswick       he took alively interest in the extension and improve
 ment of the Provincial University as a centre of liberal education; and in
 order to overcome local dif<U+FB01>culties      he appointed a commission of inquiry.
 Sir Edmund attended the meetings of the Commissioners, and took a part
 in their discussions; and although he was removed to Canada before the
 recommendations of the Commission were fully acted on, enough was done
 to ensure the permanence of the University and enhance its utility to
 the province.
    On entering on his administration of Canada, one of the <U+FB01>rst acts of Sir
 Edmund (1854—55) was to promote the efforts of a number of patriotic
 gentlemen then engaged in the attempt to reorganize the M‘Gill University,
 the only endowed institution in Lower Canada for the higher education of
 that part of the population which is of British origin.       The'. Governor not
 only gave substantial aid to their enterprise, which has been highly suc
 cessful and bene<U+FB01>cial in its results, but through his in<U+FB02>uence secured the
 appointment of the present Principal, Dr.          J.  W. Dawson, a Fellow of
 this Society, under whom a <U+FB02>ourishing school of natural science has been
 established in connexion with the University.
    It was also largely due to Sir Edmund’s in<U+FB02>uence that the provincial
 normal schools of Lower Canada were successfully established; and it was
 during his administration and under his patronage that the Natural-His
 tory Society of Montreal was enabled to erect a new building and greatly
 to enlarge its collections and other means of usefulness.
    In Upper Canada the University of Toronto especially has reason to re
 member the exertions of the Governor in preventing the division of its
 endowments,     and in furthering the erection of its new and magni<U+FB01>cent
 buildings.
    The Geological Survey of Canada under Sir William Logan was regarded
 by Sir Edmund as an object of special interest and importance.            In the
 <U+FB01>rst year of his administration he authorized the augmentation of the
 fund annually voted for its support, raising the amount from eight thou
 sand up to twenty thousand dollars; he took an early opportunity, without
 solicitation, of considerably increasing the salaries of the sta<U+FB02>'; and when
 the welfare and even      the continuance of the survey were endangered by
 political changes,   he  was  always ready to befriend it.
    These efforts of Sir Edmund Head made him distinguished as a Governor
 who understood the subjects and sympathized with the cultivators of science
 and literature,   and occasioned the termination of his government to be
 viewed by these with sincere regret.
    Seven years of of<U+FB01>cial labour in New Brunswick,         and seven in Canada,
 were now to be     followed   by seven years of comparative rest, which com
 pleted his career.      But his period of retirement was employed in a variety
 of public labours.      He acted for several years as an unpaid member of the
 Civil Service Commission for organizing competitive examinations for ap

                                       lxniii
  pointments in the public service, of the Commission appointed to consider
 the site of the National Gallery, and (in 1867) of the Trades’ Unions
 Commission.      And those who acted. with him in these several capacities
 can bear testimony to the in<U+FB02>uence which be exercised through his singu
 larly calm and temperate judgment and the unfailing considerateness with
 which he weighed the opinions of his colleagues.     He was for the last <U+FB01>ve
 years of his life Chairman of the Hudson’s Bay Company.       In April 1863
 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.      Besides his other literary
 works, of which mention has been made, he was the author of the little
 philological essay entitled “Shall and Will, two chapters on future auxi
                                                                        ’
 liary verbs” (1856 and 1858)——of a translation of ‘Viga Glum’s Saga from
 the Icelandic (1866) (a language of which the study occupied him a good
 deal towards the end of his life)—of articles on art-subjects in the Edin
burgh Review, on Eastlake (I84 7), Cavalcasella (1865), and Holbein (1866),
 on the law of settlement, on the American Civil War (l862)—and in the
 Quarterly on Isaac Taylor’s ‘Words and Phases,’ and the ‘Life of Sir
John Eliot.’      He also occasionally amused himself with poetical com
 position;   his essays in that department, chie<U+FB02>y translations, appeared
from time to time in Fraser’s Magazine.        He was engaged at the time
of   his death  on  editing a translation of Van Praet’s volume of historical
miscellanies, which has since been completed by Sir Alexander Gordon.
 If  the subjects to which his attention was thus devoted appear to in
dicate rather a discursive mind than serious addiction to any individual
vstudy, it must be remembered that his business in life was the public
service, and his pursuits in literature and art mere accessories, to supply
an active intellect with employment in the intervals of its appropriate
labour.
    Sir Edmund Head died suddenly, on the 28th of January 1868, pro
bably of disease of the heart, of which the existence was unknown to himself
and his friends.     With him the old Baronetcy enjoyed by his family be
came extinct.

                                       lxxix  _
    JOHN Davv was born at l‘enzance on the 24th of May, 1790; and he
died in his 78th year, at Ambleside, on the 24th of January last. He was
the youngest of <U+FB01>ve children, of whom Sir Humphry Davy, born twelve
years beforelhim, was the eldest.         He survived his brother thirty-nine
years; and one of the most marked features in his character for the whole
of this period, and, indeed, of his life, was the well-deserved gratitude and
veneratiou with which        he regarded that famous philosopher.       His <U+FB01>rst
introduction    to scienti<U+FB01>c  life was made at the age of eighteen, in the La
boratory of the Royal Institution, where his brother was then (1808) in
the zenith of his fame, lecturing and prosecuting chemical research.         Dr.
Davy     always considered the period of from two to three years during
whichghe acted as an assistant to Sir Humphry as one of the happiest
and best employed of his life.         On relinquishing this post he studied
medicine in Edinburgh, where he graduated in the year 1814, the same
year in which he was made a Fellow of this Society. From the year 1815,
up to the end of his life, he held various appointments in various parts of
the world in the Army Medical Department.             He passed a life of great
activity, which was but little less varied than this short sketch will
show the incidents of his history to have been.         He has left behind him
numerous papers on purely scienti<U+FB01>c subjects—chemical            and biological;
he has written the history of his brother’s life, and has also edited his
works    ; his medical experience has been embodied in a volume treating of
Army Diseases;       and he has written accounts, partly scienti<U+FB01>c, partly of
general interest, of the various countries—Ceylon,      the Ionian Islands, and
the West Indies—in which he was at di<U+FB01>'erent periods of his life stationed
in the course of his professional duties. The fact that the Royal Society
is now in course of publishing a Catalogue of Scienti<U+FB01>c Papers, renders it
 super<U+FB02>uous to specify Dr. Davy’s very numerous memoirs individually;
and it will be the aim of this notice merely to give the main features of his
life in outline, and to mark only the chief points upon which his multifarious
labours threw light.
     The <U+FB01>rst remark which a glance at a list of his contributions to science
 suggests, relates to the length of the period over which his activity in the
 way    of research extended itself.       His <U+FB01>rst paper was published in
 ‘
   Nicholson’s    J ournal' for 1811, and contained the result of certain
 investigations undertaken in vindication of the doctrines taught by his
 brother as to the simple nature of chlorine, or oxymuriatic acid, as it was
 then named, and as to the incorrectness of the then current views of the
 composition of hydrochloric, then known as “muriatic” acid.             His last
              “ On the
 paper, one              Temperature of the Common Fowl,” was read subse
 quently to his death before the Royal Society of Edinburgh this very year
  1868.
     During a considerable part of these <U+FB01>fty-seven years Dr. Davy was on
 actual service as a medical officer of the army.      His services began in the
 campaign of 1815, when he was attached to a General Hospital in Brussels ;
     von. xvr.                                                       I:

 he was shortly afterwards sent out to Ceylon', where he continued during
the suppression of a rebellion and up to the year 1820. After this he was
for several years on Mediterranean stations, in thellonian Islands <U+FB01>rst,
 and afterwards at Malta; and he was sent by Lord Palmerston in the
 year 1839 on a mission to Constantinople, which lasted nine months, and
aiming, as it did, at effecting a reform in the administration of the Turkish
 hospital system, ended in failure and disappointment.        His last public duty
was performed      as an  Inspector-General     of Army Hospitals on the West
Indian Station     during the three years     1845-1848. In the intervals of
foreign employment Dr. Davy was usually on duty at home.             An ‘ Account
of the Interior of Ceylon,’ a quarto volume published in 1821, ‘ Notes on
the Ionian Islands and Malta, with some account of Constantinople,’            two
octavo volumes published in        1842,   and a volume entitled      “The   West
Indies before and since Emancipation,” and bearing date 1854, contain
the results of his observations and investigations into the non-medical
history of these stations.     In a work ‘On the Diseases of the Army, with
contributions    to Pathology,’ published in 1862, Dr. Davy has embodied
the results of the medical experience which he gained in the discharge of
his professional duties at home and abroad.        Not the least valuable portions
of this volume are those which relate to the aetiology of the yellow and other
malarious fevers of the tropical and subtropical countries he was made
familiar with. Ten years previously to the publication of this work Dr.
Davy had acted as editor to Dr. Blair’s volume on ‘The Yellow Fever
Epidemic of British Guiana.’       It is well here to put on record that, whilst
discharging the duties of an Inspector-General at Barbadoes, he found
                                              ‘
time to deliver and publish a course of Lectures on the Study of Che
mistry,’ with especial reference to the agricultural requirements of the
 island.   Dr. Davy had many years previously acted as editor of Sir Hum~
phry’s   well-known   and much read treatise on ‘ Agricultural Chemistry.’
    Two volumes of ‘ Researches, Anatomical and Physiological,’ were pub»
lished by Dr. Davy in the year 1839 ; and they were followed by a third
on the same subjects in the year 1863.             The papers collected in these
three volumes are of a very varied character; those on the Torpedo ; on
the Structure of the Heart of Amphibia; on the Generative Organs of
Cartilaginous    Fishes; on the Blood-corpuscles of the Ornithorlzynclms;
on the Temperature of Man in the Tropics; on the ova of the Salmonidze,
with reference to the Distribution of Species; and especially those on the
Blood and the cause of its Coagulation, are the most particularly note
worthy, and the most particularly connected with the author’s name.
    The debt of gratitude which Dr. Davy owed to Sir Humphry for the
assistance and sympathy which he received from him in early life, be
discharged, so faras such obligations can be discharged, by the publication
in 1836 of ‘Memoirs of the Life of Sir Humphry Davy, Bart.,' in two
 volumes;    secondly, by his edition of the works of Sir Humphry in twelve
 volumes,   the <U+FB01>rst of which is a Biography condensed from the two

                                                                             -   “VI-r
                                        lxxxi
volumes just mentioned, the'author “ carefully abstaining from all that was
controversial and vindicatery, trusting that what was before a duty was
then super<U+FB02>uous ;” and, thirdly, by the volume of ‘ Fragmentary Remains,
Literary and Scienti<U+FB01>c,’   which contained a sketch of his brother’s life and
was published in 1858. The sixth volume of this edition of Sir Humphry
Davy’s works, and the second volume of the <U+FB01>rst of the Biographies of
him published by his brother, contain a full statement of the relative claims
of Sir H. Davy and George Stephenson respectively to be considered the
inventor of the Safety Lamp.      Upon another occasion, and as recently as
 1864—1865, as may be seen by a reference to the pages of the Philosophical
Magazine, Dr. Davy engaged himself in a vindication of his brother’s repu
tation from certain aspersions which had been cast upon it with reference
to his conduct when President of this Society.
   Dr. Davy was the author of two works on Angling, which have the form
of colloquies, and are discursive and digressive, especially in the direction of
the various biological bearings of the sport.      His liking for this pursuit
was, as is well known from the ‘ Salmonia,’        common to him with the
author of that work.
   Dr. Davy pursued a regular and methodical course of literary and
scienti<U+FB01>c work up to the latest days of his life.       His activity, as seen in
his later years at the Meetings of the British Association, which he regularly
attended, was the wonder of much younger men.           Those who saw him in
ordinary life gathered from the sight the moral that regular habits in
ordinary life are the best guarantee for the possession of a power for putting
forth extraordinary exertions upon extraordinary occasions.
   The great reputation which, in spite of all efforts to the contrary, has
settled round the name of Sir Humphry Davy, has necessarily put Dr. John
Davy’s claims for scienti<U+FB01>c distinction somewhat at a disadvantage.          The
younger brother’s main de<U+FB01>ciencies were de<U+FB01>ciencies affecting his power of
imagination and his faculty of exposition, and for excellence in these mental
qualities the elder brother was not less preeminently distinguished than for
his more strictly scienti<U+FB01>c abilities. It is much to the credit of Dr. Davy’s
moral nature that no shadow of morti<U+FB01>cation or jealousy ever darkened his
meditations on his brother’s achievements, into comparison with which he
was so constantly forced to bring his own.    Nor can we close this notice
more <U+FB01>tly than by saying what is the literal truth, that his sympathy with
the cause of his brother’s reputation, showing itself as it did in a repeated
and successful championship of      it,
                                      elevated his whole nature and spread
through and over his long      series   of labours the warm light of   a   sunny
memory.
