  The following communications            were read    :—
I. “On       the Expansion      of Wood by Heat.”              By    J.   P. JOULE,
        LL.D.; F.R.S. &c.         Received November 5, 1857.
  In pursuing                of which abstracts have been given in
                    the researches
    ‘
the Proceedings’ for January 29 and June 18, the author found that
the heat evolved by compressing wood, cut either in or across the
direction of the grain, was nearly that due to the application to the
particular case of Professor Thomson’s formula.     Exact agreement
could not be expected, on account of the discordant results arrived at
by di<U+FB01>erént experimenters on the expansion of wood.        On investi
gating the subject, the author <U+FB01>nds that the expansion of wood cut
in the direction of the grain, is greatly in<U+FB02>uenced by the tension-to
which it is exposed, as well as by its humidity.      A rod of well
seasoned and dried bay-wood, §ths of an inch in diameter, and exposed
to the tension of 26 lbs., gave an expansion of 00000461 per degree
Centigrade, but when a weight of 426 lbs. was hung to          its co      it,
e<U+FB02>-icient of expansion was increased to '00000566.     In conformity
with this result,    it   was found that the elasticity of the rod was con
siderably diminished   by an increase of its temperature.    On inves
tigating the effect of humidity, the author found that      occasioned
                                                                     it
a diminution in the expansibility by heat.   After the rod of bay-wood
with which the above experiments were made had been immersed in
water until    it   had taken up     150 grains,       making its total weight
-882 grs.,   its expansion with      aof 26 lbs. was found to be
                                         tension
only '000000436.  Experiments with     rod of deal 33 inches long,
                                               a
and weighing when dried 425 grs., gave similar results. Its expan
sion when dry, with 26 lbs. tension, was '00000428, and with 226 lbs.
'00000438; but when made to absorb water, its coefficient of
expansion  gradually decreased, until, when    weighed 874 grs.,
                                                          it
indicating an absorption of 449 grs. of water, expansion by heat
ceased altogether, and, on the contrary,           a   contraction   by heat equal
to '000000636 was experienced.
                                                                     B2

II. “On      the Partitions of the r-Pyramid, being the first class
        or r-gonous x-edra.”    By the Rev. T. P. KIRKMAN, M.A.,
        F.R.S.       Received October 14, 1857.
                                      (Abstract.)
  Partitions proper of the r-pyramid              are made by drawing diagonals
none crossing another in the r-gonal base, and diapeds (intersections
of non-contiguous faces) none enclosing a space, in the r-edral vertex.
The object of the memoir is to enumerate the number of such par
titions that can be made with K diapeds in the vertex and k diagonals
in the bases of the pyramid.    By the drawing of k diagonals, the
pyramid becomes a (r--1)-acral (r--k+1)-edron, which by the                                      in
troduction of K diapeds becomes a (r-i-K+1)-acral (r-Hk+1)-edron.
Such a figure is termed an r-gonous          (r-HK+1)-acral (r-i-k+1)-edron
of the first   class.        The definition of an r-gonous z-edron of the first
class is that     it contains a discrete r-gony, i.e. K diapeds and k
diagonals of which no diaped meets a diagonal, and such that the
convanescence of the K diapeds will form an r-ace, and the eva
nescence     of the diagonals forms an r-gon.
   If   the summits upon the k diagonals be, one or more of them,
partitioned by       K'   diapeds, or the faces about the              K   diapeds be       par
titioned by k’ diagonals, there arises a mixed r-gony, in which are one
or more angles made by a diaped and a diagonal.           such a figure    If
has not a discrete r-gony as well as that mixed one, and has no
(r-Hr')-gony, by the vanescence of which the (r-Hr')-pyramid                                 can
be obtained, it is an r-gonous r-edron of the second class.                                 And
r-gonous w-edra of the third class can be obtained by partitioning
the faces about the K' diapeds and the summits upon the k’ diagonals,
in such      a manner that no        (r-Hr')-gony shall be introduced; and so
on for higher classes          of r-gonous r-edra.
   It is proved
                                                                                                  is is,
              that every partition proper of the r-pyramid, that
any (1+K)-partitioned r-ace laid                on
                                            k)-partitioned r-gon,
                                                     a   (1   +
 an   r-gonous   (r-i-k+1)-acral (r--k+1)-edron.
                                                                                         of of
                                                                      The number                 the
(1+k)-partitions          of   the r-gon, and   of   the      (1   +K)-partitions                the
                        by
r-ace   is   known           the formulae given      in   the author's          memoir     “On
the partitions       of   the r-gon and r-ace,”          in   the Philosophical      Trans
actions, 1857.          The present memoir gives the formulae whereby the

                                                    5
 partitions of the pyramid are determined in terms of those of the
 r-gon and r-ace.
  Thus the entire first class of r-gonous x-edra is enumerated, with
out descending to any classification of polyedra according to the
rank of their faces and summits. The enumeration of the second
and higher       classes         will require such classification, which will                   in
troduce so vast a complexity as to render the further prosecution                                of
the theory of the polyedra, in the opinion of the author, practically
impossible by any method deserving the name of scientific generality.

         HERAPATH,              M.D. Lond, F.R.S.E.                      Communicated           by
         Prof. STOKEs, Sec. R.S.                     Received      June 19, 1857.
                                               (Abstract.)
     PART I.—Critical examination of the ordinary methods em
            ployed for the discrimination of the Cinchona Alkaloids,
            viz. Quinine, Quinidin, and Quinicine and Cinchonine,
            Cinchonidin and Cinchonicine; together with the optical
            and chemical characters of their Iodo-Sulphates, upon
            which new methods are founded.
    In   consequence       of the gradually increasing scarcity of the cortex
cinchonae     calysaya and               its   chief product quinine, many other barks
have been introduced into commerce, which furnish alkaloids having
a strong general resemblance     the physical characters
                                                  in         those                       of
preparations         of   them more commonly                 employed       in   medicine, but
differing widely          in   medicinal properties and commercial values.
    In   order   to   prevent fraudulent                adulterations,     it   has long been
highly desirable          to   have some ready methods              of   detecting admixtures
of   these alkaloids           and their salts.          The author having discovered
several optical salts           of   these vegetable alkaloids,            proposes      to   make
their well-marked              optical    characters the means             of   such detection,
and   the second part
       in              this paper has fully developed his views
                                     of
upon this ready method                    of
                           analysis, whilst   the present part        in
he has      passed    under review the various existing tests for the                     differ
ent cinchona alkaloids,               and the results        of   his investigations may        be

   The following different methods of detecting the various                                          cinchoma
alkaloids have been proposed:—
     To Bouchardat and Pasteur                    we are indebted             for the     use   of polarized
light   as a means            of discriminating             these alkaloids              by the rotatory
                                                       of its
power which they exercise upon                              plane.
     Liebig employs the difference                              their solubility          in   ether for the
same purpose.
               of all
     Almost             the other tests proposed have for their object only the
discovery           quinine.
     Professor Stokes employs fluorescence, combined with the peculial
reaction,     in   respect        to   this phenomenon,              of hydrochloric acid, alkaline
chlorides, &c.               Brandes, the green reaction produced                               by      the suc.
cessive addition             of   chlorine and ammonia, whilst Vogel has modified
this latter test         in    several ways.
     Pelletier has employed the agency                          ofa     stream      of   chlorine gas, and
Marchand           uses nascent oxygen, obtained from puce-coloured oxide
of   lead and sulphuric acid for the discovery                               of   quinine.
     Leers first proposed  combination a                        of   Liebig's ether test, with                tha.
of   Brandes's chlorine and ammonia reaction,
                                                                                                in of
                                                                             as
                                                                             a      means            establish
ing the purity           of   cinchonidin (miscalled                 by   him quinidin,                 common
with    all   German chemists).
     De Vry has advised the employment                          hydriodic acid
                                                                        of                              or   iodid
of   potassium          in   order     to   discover the quinidin    Pasteur. of
     Van Heijningen                  depends      on   oxalate       of   ammonia          to   discriminat
quinine from quinidin.
     All these      different tests the author has examined most critically
         :
and,    as    far       as        is   possible      to    do     so,     determined           the absolut

these remarkable alkaloids,                     from which              it    appeared that quinin
and cinchonidin               are powerfully laevogyrate, quinidin and cinchonin
pre-eminently            dextrogyrate, and that quinicine and cinchomicine                                      ar
only slightly dextrogyrate upon plane-polarized light.                                     These eminen
experimenters            determined also with accuracy the amount                                       of    thes
molecular          rotations for each alkaloid.                      Yet the expensive nature                    C
the apparatus, the complex formula requisite                                  to   reduce the observe
amount        of   angular rotation             to     the normal molecular standard,                          an

the many interfering               actions necessary to be guarded against, effec
tually prevented this from                     ever becoming             a process for general
adoption, either among chemists or manufacturers.
   Another method of recognizing the presence of quinine is founded
on the optical phenomena                  of fluorescence, which have                     been    investi
gated by Professor             Whilst endeavouring to turn this pro
                               Stokes.
cess to account in the quantitative estimation of quinine by means
of excessive dilution, and marking the points at which the various
phenomena of “epipolism,” “fluorescence,”                                and “internal            disper
sion” vanish, the author arrived at the following extraordinary re
sults; premising that he employs the term “internal dispersion”
to mean the positive, “fluorescence” the comparative, and                                             “epi
polism” the superlative               degrees    of the     same optical         power:
   I.    Solutions         containing      1   grain in 35,000             of either quinine or
quinidin of Pasteur, exhibit epipolism and fluorescence;                                      solutions
with     1   grain in somewhat less than 140,000 grains of water are still
fluorescent, with slight internal dispersion.
   When diluted with from 3 to                   10 gallons          of water,      these alkaloids
continue to exhibit internal dispersion.                                                                   -
   Solutions of quinicine are only slightly epipolic, and if the
change has been perfect, scarcely at                       all
                                        fluorescent, but neverthe
less strongly absorptive             of   rays   ofhigh refrangibility.
  Cinchonidin also exhibits optical phenomena, but                                       much slighter
                                                                              of or in
degree; about I'nth part      that    either quinine

   II.               on                                               of   quinine, quinidin,
                                                                                                           all or
             That         mixing     fluorescent solutions
other cinchona alkaloid with the soluble                              chlorides,         although
             of   optical phenomena are lost                       the eye, yet the media still
                                                           on to
traces
possess powerfully             absorbent powers                    the rays   of     high refrangi
bility, and,        if    sufficiently concentrated, are wholly opaque                           to   them,
without exhibiting any               of   the phenomena             of   dispersion, and greatly
impede chemical action.
  This        was proved
                               by   three methods          of   observation:—
   1st. By introducing                vessels    containing           fluorescent         solutions        of
quinine into other vessels filled with non-fluorescent solutions   the                                of
alkaloids, produced             by
                         previous admixture with chloride        ammo                        of
mium, when          all   optical phenomena disappeared from the inner vessel.

                                                           8
     2ndly.      By surrounding                  of fluor-spar with
                                                 fluorescent specimens
these prepared solutions of the alkaloids, when the blue colour in
the spar immediately disappeared.
     3rdly. By photography; employing concentrated solutions of qui
nine mixed with chloride                      of ammonium in troughs to intercept the
incident       light from any object anterior to the camera, when it was
found       almost impossible                 to obtain         any image upon the sensitive
collodion plate, although the intensity of the visible image received
on the ground-glass screen did not suffer any apparent diminution.
     4thly. By photographic                      printing;         troughs containing these                       solu
tions obstructed the chemical rays very considerably, thus interfering
with the production                     of a positive picture from the negative, much
longer exposure being necessary                           to produce any chemical effect.
     III.
        That certain reagents do not destroy fluorescence; others
only mask           its
                appearance                    by
                              their own colour; whilst some destroy
it    by
       neutralizing the excess      acid; others      of  producing                   do   so       by
salts which are themselves non-fluorescent media. Whilst      third                                          a
class destroy           it    by   really modifying the alkaloid itself.
     IV. That           as   so   many reagents         of   common occurrence interfere with
the manifestation                  of   fluorescence, and              as   itis   also    a   property           com
                                                                                                its
               no all
mon       to            the cinchona alkaloids                 herein described,                      appearance
becomes                 longer     of   any value         as
                                                          a    test for quinine.
     W.    Brandes's chlorine and ammonia test will discover                                             1   grain     of
either      quinine           or   quinidin      in   1   gallon       of    water, but shows                    no   dif
ference between                   these alkaloids,         except       in       very concentrated                solu
tions,      when there              is   a   precipitate        with quinidin,                 but       not      with
quinine.                                                           -
     Quinicine          is   also influenced by this test, but less extensively.
     VI.    Dr. Vogel's first modification                      of      this test
                                                                                       is
                                                                                       of             no   apparent
value; but              by   also employing ammonia, the author has found that                                         it
will indicate both quinine and quinidin, detecting readily                                                   1   grain
of either     pint, and showing slight evidence with grain
               in   a                                                                      1             in   10,000
grains      of   water.
     There     is   scarcely any reaction with quinicine.
     VII.Dr. Vogel’s other modifications   Brandes's test are unim     of
portant, with the exception   the fourth, viz. excess
                                                 of    chlorine, and                           of
very little ammonia.                      This detects         1   grain         in   about 2000 grs.                  of
fluid very readily,                if   excess     of   acid    be     avoided        at   first.        The test,

                                            9
however, is equally indicative of quinidin;                it gives scarcely any per
ceptible reaction with quinicine.
     VIII.      Pelletier's chlorine gas-test succeeds very well with the free
alkaloids, but does not show any indication with their salts.                           It is
equally capable    of detecting quinidin, and gives the same phenomena.
     IX.    Marchand’s test is not a delicate reaction.
   X. All the foregoing tests, although specially proposed for the
discovery of quinine, possess equal powers and show the same ap
pearances with quinidin.    But they have no reaction on cinchonine,
cinchonidin, or cinchonicine.
     XI.    Van Heijningen's test by oxalate of ammonia, produces, after
some hours, a crystalline oxalate        of quinine, when using a fluid con
taining only        1   grain of alkaloid in 800 grs. of water, and very
readily detects immediately 1 part in 350.  It does not precipitate
quinidin or cinchonidin, but it produces a white precipitate in con
centrated solutions of cinchonine.
     XII.    De Vry's test for quinidin by hydriodic acid, or iodide                       of
potassium   in neutral solutions, produces a well-marked crystalline
precipitate as a colourless salt, when one part of the alkaloid is
present in 1000 of the fluid; the crystals, being short hemihedral
prisms, are readily recognized; the neutral hydriodates of cincho
nidin are colourless, silky, prismatic needles, and much more soluble.
If  to a solution of the sulphate of quinidin in dilute spirit (#) we
add hydriodic acid, and expose to the action of light during                            some
days, there is formed the red iodo-sulphate of the author.
     The neutral hydriodate of quinine appears               as lemon-yellow     prisms.
The neutral hydriodate of cinchonine appears                   as long,   thick, colour
less prisms, and is very soluble.
     XIII.Liebig's ether test dissolves quinine, quinicine, and cin
chonicine, and therefore does not discriminate between them, as they
are   all
       uncrystallizable.          It
                            dissolves also    portion    the quinidin  of
and cinchonidin.         Should the proportions       of a   these alkaloids     not      ex
ceed the solvent powers          of   the ether employed, they will not           be    indi
cated      by
          this test. When crystallization occurs, the rhombic prisms
indicate cinchonidin; the long slender aciculae, quinidin; whilst                          an
amorphous         powder   is   demonstrative   of   cinchonine.          Ether also      ex
tracts cinchonidin from cinchonine; but              its   sparing solubility
                                                                                of in
                                                                                        ethe.
necessitates the employment            of warmth, and      a   large quantity      ether.

                                                 10
   XIV.        Leers' combination of the ether test with that of Brande
can readily detect small portions                    of quinine, quinidin, or quinicin
in cinchonine or cinchonidin, especially when                         used     in the manner a
modified by the author.
   PART II.—On the Optical and Chemical Characters of th
       Iodo-Sulphates of the Cinchona Alkaloids, Quinine
       Quinidin and Quinicin, and Cinchonine, Cinchonidi
              and Cinchonicine; together with the Chemical Ana
              lysis of many of the Salts, and new methods of discri
              minating those Alkaloids, founded upon the production
              of these remarkable compounds, and the recognition o
              their optical characters.
   In    the former part of his paper, the author examined the existin
tests for discriminating              between the various cinchona alkaloids,                    an
pointed out their insufficiency.                 In the present part, he shows tha
the optical       characteristics           of the iodo-sulphates              of the alkaloid
quinine       and quinidin        are sufficiently well marked to render the ex
istence of either one         of       these   alkaloids     certain, and that althoug|
the iodo-sulphate of cinchonidin                 is very closely related optically an
chemically to the homologous salt of quinine, yet there are sufficien
points of dissimilarity to enable us to diagnose between the two
and, moreover, that the production of this salt is a beautiful mean
of deciding readily whether cinchonidin is present in specimens o
cinchonine       or cinchonicine;              all   evidence      of   quinine      or   its   allie
having been decided           in      the negative          by   the results    of   the previou
                          of by
tests,   as   proposed        Brandes,Vogel, Pelletier, Leers,                    or   the author
  The cinchonidin    Wittstein has also, by the same method, bee.
proved by the author                   be
                           totally different from the cinchonidin
                                  to                                                               o
Pasteur.
  Acetic acid and chloroform may also                       be   employed for discriminatin
between cinchonine and cinchonidin.
   The chemical characters of all                these iodo-salts         furnish no means         c
discrimination,       for  as   class they
                                  a           agree   all            in   being more        or    les
soluble    in    spirit, giving    deep sherry-brown                    solution, from whic
                                   in a
water precipitates them                   an   amorphous form,       dark brown, cin
                                                                          as
namon-brown          or   purplish-brown             coloured precipitates; they                  ar

only very slightly soluble           in dilute spirit, and scarcely at all in
water, ether, turpentine, or chloroform: acetic, dilute sulphuric, or
hydrochloric acid have but little action upon them, whilst concen
trated   hydrochloric or sulphuric acid decomposes them.                      Nitric
acid rapidly acts upon them, even in the cold, with violent evolution
of nitrous acid and production of heat, iodine being oftentimes libe
rated in the crystalline form.
   Alkalies also decompose them.
    Sulphuretted hydrogen, soluble sulphides, sulphurous acid and
snlphites, together with chlorine-water,                instantly decolour their
alcoholic solution, with the production             of hydriodic acid.
    In  dilute  alcoholic     solutions, starch gives immediate          evidence of
iodine, and nitrate of silver gives a yellowish-white precipitate           of iodide
of silver, and    some    organic basic compound which can only be re
moved by the action of concentrated boiling nitric acid                ;  this reac
tion, although commencing at the ordinary temperature, with violent
disengagement of nitrous acid vapours, must be perfected by boiling.
    Baryta salts exhibit the existence of sulphuric acid, which in all
instances is an essential constituent in their formation.
    The quinidin and cinchonine salts dissolve with more difficulty, in
consequence      of their greater thickness and less extent of surface.
    Since the author had the honour of communicating                 his discovery
 of the optical salt of cinchonidin to the Royal Society (a preliminary
                                                                                       '
 notice of which was published in the ‘ Proceedings,’ vol. viii. No. 24),
 he has ascertained that its primary form is, like that of the quinine
 salt, that of a right rhombic prism, and usually very thin, but having
 for its acute angles     -13°, and 137° for its obtuse, with the rectangular
 axes  M%.m;        T%.-OW;        5'7,-mo-1-——the  quantity for P“ being variable
 and very minute.         In   a former communication        to the Royal Society,
                      ‘
 published in the       Proceedings’        (Feb. 16, vol. vi. No. 24, 1854), the
 quinine salt was shown to have a primary rhombus, having 65° for
 the acute, and 115° for the obtuse angles, with the three rectangular
 axes, thus related :—M{-.5-7-;             %.T,-W; P90-OWT.
     In both   salts the optical      characters    are usually examined through
 the shortest axis, P“      :  in   some     recent observations   on the quinine
 salt, the author has discovered that it transmits a blood-red beam                 of
 plane-polarized     light through the axes M“ and T“, and this is also              a
 beam polarized in a plane parallel to that of the axes M“ and T“.

     In
     the foregoing comparative Chart of the physical properties of
the two salts, the axis has been assumed to coincide with a line
drawn through the short diagonal    of the primary rhombic crystal,
which will coincide with the long diameter of the a-prism, and the
plane of the breadth of the /3-prism, and is therefore the T" of the
three rectangular crystallographic                                       axes.
     It   has been compiled from the observations                                                          of Professors Stokes
and Haidinger and the author.                                                It       appears to form a complete
optical description of the two salts, as far as they are at present known.
  Whilst in both salts the indicative body-colours, or those due to
the more absorbed pencils (3), are only to be seen in the thinnest
crystals, it is evident that the reflected rays may                                                         be seen indifferently

absorption, and therefore total obstruction, being more early arrived

     The results of the analysis of the cinchonidin salt having been so
remarkably            different from those of the formulae generally adopted for
the pure alkaloid, the author was induced to prepare some perfectly

which appears to be the constitution                          of the optical salt dried at
62°Fahr. over sulphuric acid.
  From this it appears that the optical salt of quinine differs in
chemical atomic numbers merely in the possession of                                         1    atom less
iodine, the cinchonidin salt having 3, the quinine salt 2 atoms iodime;

          of C*H*N*O" common to both. How this is derived

from C"H*N*O" in the one case, or C" H*N*O” in the other, it
is difficult to point out in the present                   state    of the question.
  Were these views correct, it might naturally                            be imagined that the
two salts may be mutually convertible.    The author has undertaken
numerous experiments with this object in view; and whilst he has
proved that it is possible (by boiling the quinine salt in spirit sur
charged with iodine) to communicate the golden tint of the reflected
ray and the blue tint of the body-colour                            to the crystals on their
re-formation,     yet this modified salt retains the crystallographic                               forms
of the true quinine salt; whilst, by treating the cinchonidin salt by
spirit and aqueous sulphurous acid, that salt is modified also,
becomes fibrous in character,                   and assumes the red body-colour                           of
quinine salt, yet is at once to be distinguished                         from the true quinine
salt even by the naked eye alone; and on redissolving                                            these in
spirit, the blue body-coloured                 salt again recrystallizes with                     its   ordi
nary golden reflected tint.                The effectsulphuric acid

converting the cinchonidin salt into the golden silky fibrous variety,
is
a   striking distinguishing characteristic between the two alkaloids.
                                 the conclusion, that the grouping                          of          con
                         in to
  These facts lead                                                                               the
stituent molecules           the two salts differs materially; that closely                               as
the quinine      and cinchonidin              salts agree amongst themselves, they
differ widely from the quinidin and cinchonine compounds.
   The quinidin salt, after recrystallization, presents itself                                     as   long

which differs from Gerhardt's formula for quinidin by the loss of
C”   H”; but        at this stage               of the question it is scarcely possible to
arrive at a solution of the manner in which it is produced.
     The cinchonine salt differs much from                                      all      those previously             de
scribed;       it   exists     in    long, acicular, quadrilateral                         prisms,        of a    deep
purplish-black colour, like that    elder-berries.          of
  Thin   crystals transmit    yellow tint—pure gamboge-yellow when
                                             a
very thin; soon passing through        deep sherry-brown     blood

red colour,          then      a       deep         port-wine              colour,       and     then      becoming
opaque.
     These crystals reflect                a   deep steel-blue colour when analysed                               with
a    Nichol's       prism,         and generally across the short diameter                                       of   the
prism, which         is   the analogue                 of   the a-prism             ofthe quinine salt. The
cinchonine salt          possesses doubly absorbent powers, much more                                            power
fully   so     than the quinidin                    salt, but inferior               to    all   the others; the
body-colour         is   deep sienna                or   bistre-brown.

the constitution            of   the alkaloid originally employed,                           we take the
formula C*H*N*O’,                        given       by   Gerhardt, for that
                                                                                        in of

  The cinchonine and quinidin salts further agree   containing
only  atom sulphuric acid, whereas the quinine and cinchonidin
        1
salts contain         2    atoms.
   These investigations              appear          to   show that the alkaloids                     in   each
instance undergo some modification, but not analogous                                         to   substitu
tion;   it     appears more like            a    splitting-up into different molecular
groups, and           a    rearrangement         of       these amongst themselves,                    the
                                                                                                       as
formulae       of     the organic bases differ much from those                           of   the original
alkaloids.
  All     these iodo-salts possess double refractive properties.
  When the acid sulphates                  of    the mixed alkaloids, quinine, quinidin,
cinchonine          and cinchonidin,            are dissolved     dilute spirit, and the
                                                                       in
temperature            increased    to    80°        or   120°, treatment with tincture                       of
iodine readily separates the quinine salt first.
   Subsequent further treatment                       in    the same manner produces the
cinchonidin salt, more              or   less mixed         with the quinine salt.
   On still further treatment, the quinidin                              salt     is   formed with its
well-marked characters.
  The cinchonine salt                is    by    far the most soluble                   in   spirit; and
when    a   large quantity          of   cinchonine          exists, this compound will also
appear along with the quinidin salt.
  This test         is
                    a      beautiful and ready method                   of
                                                        proving the presence
of   cinchonidin           incinchonine, which would otherwise    considered                be
pure, Brandes' test having shown the absence                                 of   quinine and          quini
din.      In     the same way, this test                   is   an    easy   method          of    detecting
mixtures         of   quinine and quinidin, the optical characters                               of   the two
salts being           so   well marked, that               no   difficulties      can    exist        in   their
discrimination.                                                                                               -
  It    does not offer such facilities for the separation                              of   quinine from
cinchonidin; the two salts                      go   down together,               especially       if      large
quantities       of   cinchonidin exist with mere traces                     of   quinine.

    For the success of this test, a small portion only is necessary:
with quinine and quinidin +5th part of a grain has furnished evi
dence of the two alkaloids; one grain would be abundant to detect
all the alkaloids.
    The foregoing method of examination has enabled the author to
prove that the substance which Rosengarten, of Philadelphia, called
quinidin, was really the cinchonidin of Pasteur, and the details of
his cures of fever, therefore, by quinidin are rather to be ascribed to
cinchonidin.                                                              -
    The cinchonidin    of Wittstein, of Munich, is a totally different
alkaloid, giving, with sulphuric acid and iodine,     a salt at once to
be distinguished    by the eye from either of the two iodo-sulphates
described,    but yet possessing optically   doubly  absorbent   powers.
This salt has     a deep  orange-yellow   colour  by transmitted   light,
merging into sienna-brown in thicker plates, which are generally
flat and much imbricated in the method of crystallization, and also
derived    from a rhombic   prism.    The reflected tints are brownish
olive, not unlike dead leaves, or brown beech-leaves.      These crystals
are more doubly absorbent than either the quinidin         or cinchonine
salt, but less powerfully optical as tourmalines than the quinine or
cinchonidin compounds.       When polarized, they transmit a sienna
brown body-colour if moderately thick, and thicker plates are bistre
brown, but when sufficiently thick, they are wholly impervious to
plane-polarized light. The substance was not in sufficient quantity
to admit of any analysis.
    All the alkaloids were furnished in a     most obliging manner by
Mr. John Elliott Howard, to whom the          author is deeply indebted
for them, and thus publicly desires to express his acknowledgments;
many     of these various alkaloids having taken more than ordinary
trouble in the preparation and purification.
    It is well known that quinine and quinidin, under the continued
effect  of heat and dilute sulphuric acid, undergo a molecular change
into quinicine, which M. Pasteur has asserted to be isomeric with
the original alkaloids, but hitherto no complete analysis has been
made    of the metamorphosed alkaloids.
   The author has produced an iodo-sulphate of quinicine, but it is
no longer a crystalline compound; it presents itself as a deep blood
coloured resin, very soluble in spirit and readily precipitated by water

                                                                    22

mitted          to   analysis.   During the production                                    of   the iodo-sulphate                 of

quinicine,             as   may          be   demonstrated                  by   the production              of    this resin

     The President then addressed the Society                                       as   follows:–
          GENTLEMEN,
IN      considering what ought to form the subject of the Annual Address,
it would naturally occur to any one, having the honour to hold the
office of your President, that it might be desirable to mention in
detail        all   the important discoveries and researches which had enriched
the annals            of   science since the preceding anniversary;                              and     in   addition,
to      describe any events which had occurred,                                  or      any specific measures
which had been adopted, tending                              to    improve the position                    of   science
or      its   cultivators.           With respect however                   to   the former, the range                  of
subjects within the cognizance                         ofthis Society            is      so   extensive, that the
time ordinarily appropriated                       to   the duty,        in   which      I     am now engaged,
would            be   utterly inadequate                to    the purpose; and                      it   is    the less
necessary, since                it   has become the annual custom                              of   the Presidents
                       of
of or
        Councils            Scientific Associations,                cultivating particular branches
        science,       to    take    a     very extended view                    of   the advance made                  in
their own particular departments;                                 and       in   the case           of   the British
Association especially, whose range                               of   subjects       is   almost        as   extensive
as   our own, the Presidents                      of   that Society have been                       in   the habit      of
giving         a   very detailed statement               of   the progress               of   science during the
past year.                  may       be   permitted perhaps                        refer for       an   example        to
                                                                            of to
                      I
the Address delivered                      at   the last meeting                    the British Association,
as      containing          a   most able and lucid statement                            of   the kind        to   which
I   allude.
     Under the other head                   to   which reference has been made, one                                ofthe
most important events has been the final adoption                                              by your President
and Council                of   the twelve resolutions,                to   which    I        took the liberty          of
referring             on   a    former      occasion.       I      then stated that we had taken

                                            25'
into consideration            the important question,            whether         any measures
could be adopted by the Government                     or Parliament that would im
prove               of science in this country’! and that, having
            the position
elicited and duly weighed the opinions of all those most competent
to give advice on the subject, we had <U+FB01>nally adopted those resolutions
and forwarded them to            Lord Palmerston.            This step was taken in the
beginning        of this year. The measures recommended by them relate,
<U+FB01>rst, to education, and they are contained in Nos.                         1   to 4 inclusive        ;
secondly, there are others which have for their object the encourage
ment of scienti<U+FB01>c discovery and research, and these are Nos.                                 5    to 9
inclusive; and thirdly, Nos.           10 to 12 suggest measures,                 which, while
they are calculated to confer great bene<U+FB01>t on cultivators                             of science,
are yet       of still greater importance, when viewed in their bearings
upon the interests of the nation                at large.        Although         I   shall have
occasion to allude to some of the other recommendations,                              it is with
respect only to the last-mentioned              that    I   shall trouble you with any
detailed observations.
   Many here present will doubtless be able to recall to their recol
lection instances in which great mistakes have been committed for
want either of access to competent                scienti<U+FB01>c advice, or from reluct
ance to refer to        it,   when access    was easy;          but those who are fa
miliar with the mode of conducting                  public affairs in this country,
and at the same time duly appreciate the value                       of scienti<U+FB01>c research,
are best able to estimate the extent of this evil                ;    and to such persons
it   is   distressing   sometimes to witness the injudicious expenditure                            of
large sums of money, while the same sums bestowed upon other and
more generally bene<U+FB01>cial            objects, and under proper                    advice, might
have been productive            of very valuable results.             But this        is   not all   ;
for, side by side with this wasteful expenditure, we are compelled to
witness the most rigid parsimony, where        little money timely be
                                                            a
stowed upon the furtherance            of some measure recommended by com
petent authority might have borne fruit                 a    hundredfold.
     Your President and Council have ventured to think, that,                               if    the
Government. could be induced                to consult some responsible body of
scienti<U+FB01>c      men, either one already existing,                or to be specially con
stituted for that purpose, some of these evils,                       so   far   as they affect
science at least, might be averted          ;     and happy indeed would               it    be    for
those researches and investigations               in which      we    all take so deep an

                                                         26
interest,     if a   small part only of the money thus saved to the nation
should be expended on their promotion; and happy would                                                       it   be for
the nation,         if   such a check were provided                          against the improvident
waste of the hardly-earned produce of                               its   own industry.
     The natural tendency                   of    men    is    to   undervalue what they cannot
understand,          and thus the abstruse speculations                                 of   the geometrician,
and the recondite researches                      of   the physicist, the object                   of   which even
is   unintelligible         to    the many, are deemed                  of    no   value when weighed                  in
the balance          of   public opinion against the splendid inventions which,
after   a    long series          of   years, emanate from their labours.                           Often, when
those who have scattered the precious seed are dead and forgotten,
and their families are perhaps pining                              in   penury,          and calling           in   vain
 on    an    ungrateful           country for       a    petty dole from                     the public purse,
does    the glorious              harvest ripen, which                  they have sown.                      For this
cause       among many others, the opportunity                                    of    taking the opinions
of   such    a   Body,       or   such     a    Board, would            be   of    the last importance                 to
the best interests               of    society, for their approval would                           be
                                                                                                    a    guarantee
     the public                                                any measure which they might
                         It of
to                               the expediency           of
recommend.                       is   impossible       of    course       to      suggest any innovation
from which those who make the proposal could                                            by   possibility derive
advantage, direct                 or   indirect, without subjecting them                           to   the charge
of   doing     sofrom interested motives;—and yet distinguished Mem                a
ber     of   the Government Grant Committee, from which these reso
lutions emanated, said early      the course    their discussion, “Let
                                                  in                         of
us  ask for nothing for ourselves,” and     this spirit were the resolu
                                                                    in
tions framed.              The chief object aimed at, was the encouragement                                            of
young men, competent                       to   the task, who, with insufficient means                                 at
their command, were just entering upon                               a    hopeful career                of   scientific
research.         You will therefore look                     in   vain for any recommendations
to   bestow titles, medals,                 or   other honours upon men whose scientific
labours have long been before the world.                                  But       no   amendment              our
                                                                                                                  in
institutions could ever                    be   carried out,                                 to   be    deterred by
                                                                to,
                                                                    if  men were
such considerations                   as
                                       I   have adverted                  from fearlessly advocating
that which        in     their conscience they believe                       to    be   fraught with advan
tage.        Since the resolutions were transmitted                                     to   the Government,
they have been moved for, laid                          on   the table         of   both Houses               of    Par
liament, and printed;                      whatever further steps may                         be   taken       to   urge
their adoption,        I         do   not think that     it   would          be   right that this Society,

                                                                        W
                                      27
or its o<U+FB01>icers, assuch, should take any part in them.
                                                              '
                                                                It is enough
that your Council have expressed their opinion;        they must leave the
result to time.
    Since the last Anniversary we have been installed in the occupation
of the building in which     we are now assembled, and      all the arrange
ments for our reception have been completed, except the painting           of
the Great Hall, which has been delayed by the dampness of the walls          ;
nor have the requisite    seats been yet supplied.     I trust that the fur
niture of the rooms and the arrangement         of the library in the main
building have given satisfaction.       I think credit is due to Mr. Weld
our Assistant Secretary, and also to Mr. White, for the care and
 attention  they have displayed       in carrying into effect all our in
structions.
    It would appear from the Address of the noble Earl the President
 of the Society of Antiquaries, that some of that distinguished body
are disposed to think we did not much regret the severance             of the
connexion which had so long and happily subsisted between the two
 Societies.   Speaking for myself, and     I have no doubt for many other
members of the Royal Society,      I may say that I should greatly rejoice,
 if  by the liberality of Her Majesty’s Government that ancient
 Society again found an abode in our own immediate neighbourhood——
 not however to the exclusion of any Scienti<U+FB01>c Society that had just
 claims to similar accommodation.
    Several applications have been made to your President and Council
 requesting   permission   to use the Great     Hall for various purposes.
 On the part of the Government it has been applied for, for the pur
 pose of holding Competitive        Examinations   for admission     into the
 Royal Academy of Woolw_ich, and likewise for the Examinations of
 Candidates for Commissions in the Army.             These applications on
 the part of the War Department          have always been framed with a
 courteous regard to our convenience, and they have been acceded to.
 Your Council were of opinion that the object sought to           be obtained
 was one of great public importance, and that under the circumstances
 they should not be justi<U+FB01>ed in withholding their consent.             At the
 same time     it must be admitted that frequent demands of this de
 scription might   be productive   of inconvenience, especially in reference
 to the access to the lower library.      An application was also made by
 the   Royal Geographical      Society for the use of the Hall during

                                                           28
 the ensuing session, and this request has also been willingly                                                     com
 plied with.              That    Society meets                but once a fortnight, and on a
 day which does not interfere with our own meetings.                                               Nor     can there
 be any difference of opinion as to the value of their labours in the
promotion         of science, if prosecuted,                    as there         is every         reason to hope
they will be, with a special view to that object.                                           Indeed there are
few associations that might render more important aid in this behalf,
 than a Society instituted for the purpose of originating,                                           organizing,
and supporting extensive explorations of such portions of the earth’s
surface as have not hitherto been surveyed at all, or have been                                               imper
fectly examined.                 But in order that the operations of such a Society
should be productive of                   all   the benefit       of      which they are capable, care
should       be   taken that           no   expedition            be      allowed          to   leave our shores
without being supplied with proper instruments,                                             and     accompanied
 by   those who are competent
                                                                                                                    be as
                                                    to   make such scientific                    observations
the nature        of  the case will admit                 of; and lastly, provision should
made for the proper reduction and publication                                         of   such observations,
 so   that the results may                be   rendered         as   extensively useful              as   possible.
      On the occasion             of   sending out Lady Franklin's last expedition,
every exertion was made                     by      us   to   supply       its   able commander, Capt.
M'Clintock, with             a    complete set            of   instruments, properly constructed
and carefully compared, and with observers trained                                           in   their use. As
to    the former we were quite successful;                             but       as   to   the latter, difficul
ties arose      in   reference       to   the employment                  of
                                                                           a     particular officer, whose
services the Admiralty were unwilling                            to    dispense with.             I   am happy

to         able      to   announce         to    you that       I         have had the pleasure
perusing   letter from Capt. M'Clintock, dated from the west coast
             a
Greenland, expressing entire confidence    his brave companions and   in
in    his ship, and hopeful anticipations                            as   to   the future.           Need    I     say
more than that            it   was   a    letter written             in   the true spirit           of   a   British
Naval Officer, embarked                   in    a   momentous enterprise, conscious that
many eyes and many hearts were anxiously tracking                                                 his steps over
the icebound watery waste, and determined                                         to       put forth         all   his
energies     to   achieve success              ina       noble cause.
  That any one should entertain any doubt                                        of   the propriety           of   ex
tending      to   the utmost our acquaintance with the globe                                          we   inhabit,
seems extraordinary.                   That      men should               be   found       to   undervalue the
results    of   scientific research              is      not surprising, but that they should

                                          29
overlook the other manifold          blessings which accrue to mankind          from
successful undertakings       of this description, could not be for       a moment
believed,  if we  had not evidence that persons do really exist, who look
with indifference      at such triumphs of human enterprise;              men who
might have joined in the outcry against Columbus, and have depre
cated the expeditions of Dampier, Flinders, Cook, Parry and others.
Had a majority of the so-called educated portion of mankind consisted
of such men, we should perhaps now be without America and Au
stralia,  the human       mind would have been miserably stunted in its
growth, and civilization impeded in its progress. Such views are not
likely to obtain much          support     at the present time       ; we may rest
assured, for example, that Government will entertain with favour the
proposal for exploring the river Zambesi, which has been suggested
by the travels of that most persevering benefactor of mankind,                    the
enterprising    and distinguished       Livingstone.
   Though,     as I  have already said, it would be impossible            to specify
all the facts of interest which have          been lately observed     in the arena
of physical research, there are some recent discoveries in magnetism
which    I should   be   unwilling to pass over in silence.
   All   who have attended to 'magnetical phenomena, are aware, that
among the results      of magnetic observations, and especially that exten
sive system of research, which was organized a few years ago at the
earnest request    of the illustrious traveller Humboldt, is to be reckoned
the correct knowledge which we now possess of the regular periodical
changes of the magnetic elements, depending on the hour of the day,
the  season-  of the year, and also on a period, somewhat exceeding ten
of our years, which, when <U+FB01>rst discovered, appeared to have no ana
logue in any other known periodical phenomenon.
   Besides these regular periodical           e<U+FB02>ects, there are changes which
occur suddenly at irregular intervals, and simultaneously in the most
distant parts    of the earth—
                                “ . . . . . though the main
                  Roll its broad  surge betwixt, and different stars
                  Behold their wakeful motions,”
to use the words of a poet and a Fellow             of the Royal Society, who,
writing at   a very early age, and above a hundred            years ago, seems by
an   extraordinary     accident to have described by anticipation             one   of

                                    30
the most remarkable magnetic phenomena revealed to us by modern
discoveries.
   Now these sudden changes are characterized by very large devia
tions from the normal state.      They are termed “ Magnetic Storms."
It  is found,   however, that these     storms occur more frequently        at
certain hours of the day than at others, and are therefore themselves
subject to periodical    laws.   These   laws have been worked         out by
our able and persevering Treasurer, who has devoted, and with such
distinguished   success,  so much  of his valuable time to this species of
research, and he <U+FB01>nds that even these storms observe diurnal, annual,
and decennial periods.
   Several who are now present are aware how many years of laborious
toil have been expended in procuring these striking results. In various
places of our colonies and dependencies, at St. Helena, at Toronto, at
Hobarton, for example, o<U+FB02>icers and non-commissioned o<U+FB01>icers of the
Artillery, and officers of the Royal Navy were engaged hourly
through the day and night in watching the vibrations and angles
of small magnetic needles delicately        suspended;     a class   of obser
vations of a very tedious and exhausting        description,   and requiring
great patience, perseverance and accuracy.         Still, undeterred    by all
these di<U+FB01>iculties,  and often doubtless at great personal sacri<U+FB01>ce, these
true votaries    of science continued     their anxious     vigils.    As the
observations    were received by General      Sabine, they were carefully
reduced and coordinated       at an establishment    organized      by him at
Woolwich for that purpose.
    But while this  was proceeding, there was, unknown       to our magnetic
observers, another persevering enthusiast at work, whose labours were
 destined to have an important relation to theirs.
   We must transport ourselves, in imagination, to the upper chamber
of a modest dwelling in an obscure town in Germany, in which an
old man has day by day for thirty long weary             years been in the
 habit of observing the sun through two small telescopes, placed in a
window overlooking the roofs of the houses.           Every day, when the
luminary was visible, did this persevering observer, Schwabe by name,
 survey its face, and note down the appearances        of its disk. In this
way he obtained a     faithful record of the con<U+FB01>guration of the spots
 during the whole of this long period. Science presents few examples
 of such unwearied concentration of attention on one object.            Often,

                                        31
no doubt, the friends, and perhaps the relatives         of the observer, have
presumed     to ridicule his devotion       to what seemed to them a trivial
pursuit;    but the result of all this labour was the discovery of what
had escaped the attention of all astronomers for two hundred years,
at least had been before only very faintly suspected, viz. that the spots
on the sun’s disk pass through the phases of maximum and minimum
frequency in a period    of about ten years.       But, strange to say, it was
then discovered, and <U+FB01>rst announced in our Transactions by General
Sabine the discoverer, that the decennial magnetic period coincides,
both in its duration and in its epochs of maximum and minimum, with
the decennial period observed by Schwabe in the solar spots ; that is,
the period     of maximum variation with that of the maximum fre
quency of spots, and so vice vers<U+FB01> the minimum. Hence it is clear that
the sun exercises some in<U+FB02>uence on the earth’s magnetism dependent
on the existing state of its own luminous         atmosphere.     Surely this is
anotherremarkable      instance that fact is often more strange than <U+FB01>ction.
How little could the secluded observer, watching the quiverings of the
needle in the remote regions of Australia, or on the shores of the
Polar   Sea,   dream either      that his labours would derive additional
interest from the unconscious         cooperation of a German astronomer,
or that he was himself engaged in watching vibrations              which were
oscillating in harmony with the motions of a gaseous substance ninety
<U+FB01>ve millions of miles away ! This is again another example added to
the many other illustrations of the same truth, that scienti<U+FB01>c               re
searches,   if skilfully and perseveringly      continued, often lead to most
valuable    results, which could not have been anticipated            a priori;
and this should surely be as great an incentive to toil as it is a glorious
reward of discovery.
   But this is not all: it has been found also that our          less obtrusive
satellite, that the mild in<U+FB02>uence of the moon affects the magnetic
needle;    the declination,    the inclination, and the magnetic force, all
undergo a small variation, dependent on the lunar hour angle.                 A
delicately    suspended     magnet is truly the most submissive          of all
slaves, affected by the sun, and the moon, and the earth, and the
sport of every electric or magnetic current that approaches it.
                                             “ Whate'er the line
                Which one possessed, nor pause nor quiet knew
               The sure associate, ere, with trembling speed,
                He found its path, and <U+FB01>xed unerring there."

       Before leaving the subject     of magnetism, I would mention another
    result lately obtained in that department of science, which we owe
    to one of those voyages to the Arctic Seas, which some are wont to
    describe as useless to mankind, and a foolish exposure of human life.
       Capt. Maguire commanded the Plover, one of the ships employed
    in the Franklin search in the years l852—3—4, and he was stationed
    from the summer of 1852 to that of 1854 at Point Barrow, the most
   northern cape     of the American Continent, between Behring's Strait
   and the Mackenzie River.          During every hourof seventeen months
   unremittingly did Capt. M aguire and his officers observe and record
   the variations of the magnetic declination and the concomitant
   auroral   phenomena,      in an observatory built of ice and lined with
   seal-skins;   in a most dreary and unenviable      locality indeed, but still
   one of the most favourable        for such investigations.      The observa
   tions, as usual, were reduced under the direction          of our Treasurer,
   and they reveal this important fact      :—()n comparing them with those
   made at Toronto, it was found, that although the de<U+FB02>ections of the
   same name at the two stations      did not correspond,there   existed, on the
   other hand, a very striking and remarkable         correspondence between
   the easterly disturbances at Point Barrow and the westerly at Toronto,
   and vice versli.    In the   case  of the regular solar-diurnal variation,
   the easterly and westerly extremes are reached at both stations             at
   nearly   the same     hours; but in the      case of the abnormal     diurnal
  variation, the progression is reversed, the easterly extreme at the one
  coinciding    very nearly with the westerly at the other.        The absolute
  disturbing force appears to be much greater at Point Barrow than at
  Toronto, and in correspondence therewith is the frequency of the
  auroral   manifestations.      During the six months of darkness in the
  two successive winters, out      of 3625 hourly observations, there were
   1077, or 30 per cent., at which-the aurora was visible.          It appeared,
  also, that   1 A.M. was the hour at which aurora most frequently           ap
  peared, and that between        ll  A.M. and 3 P.M. is the period of mini
  mum frequency.
      The  above   interesting  results have suggested to the British Asso
  ciation the importance       of instituting magnetic observations for an
  other winter    or two at some point, so situated between the above
  mentioned two stations, as to render it a proper           locality for ascer
. taining the laws on which the remarkable and characteristic          analogies

                                             33
   and differences in the results         derived from each depend.        There is
   no place better <U+FB01>tted for this purpose than the mouth of Mackenzie’s
   River.     I  cannot but express my earnest desire that Her Majesty’s
   Government will also consent to send out one vessel for this purpose,
  as  it will be attended with little or no risk, and           a most   important
  scienti<U+FB01>c object will be attained.           Moreover,  it will be a great satis
  faction to the friends       of Capt. M‘Clintock       and his gallant    crew to
  know    that there      is a vessel    stationed at such a spot, should       any
  unlooked-for misfortune          befall an expedition, which, thanks to the
  devotion     of  a bereaved widow to her heroic husband,            has cost the
  country nothing but the expenditure            of a few   hitherto unemployed
  stores.
     The Meteorological         Department      of the Board of Trade, under
  the able superintendence          of Admiral Fitz_Boy, bids fair to realize
  all the hopeful       anticipations    which were formed of the bene<U+FB01>cial
  effects which such an institution was calculated             to produce in im
  proving Navigation and the           science   of Meteorology. Agents have
 now been       established at the principal ports for the supply of instru
 ments properly veri<U+FB01>ed,           books    and instructions.     More than two
 hundred ships have been           so supplied,   and more than      one hundred
 logs have been forwarded,           which are in process of coordination      and
 reduction.       Valuable materials       are thus continually accumulating,
 and ‘to such a degree, that the only dif<U+FB01>culties             of the O<U+FB02>ice arise
 from the overwhelming extent of the communications which are daily
 pouring in,—-overwhelming, that is to say, when viewed in reference
 to the Staff available for reducing them.
     Meanwhile other Governments have not been slow to avail them
 selves of the advantages to be derived from Lieut. Maury’s Sailing
 Directions and Charts, and the measures which he recommends.
 The O<U+FB02>icer at the head of the Meteorological Department of the
 Dutch Marine states, that by their means the voyages to Batavia
have been shortened one-eighth.               An O<U+FB01>icer of the French Navy is
 also engaged in condensing           and translating    Maury’s works for the
use   of the French Marine; and              a French Department      of Oceanic
Meteorology is about to           be formed.      Other nations have followed
in the    same     track,   and, on the whole, voyages have been already
reduced     to from a tenth to a quarter of their former periods; a
result to   be attributed     in part doubtless to the improvement in ship

building, to which art Science has lately rendered important aid, but
principally to the cause in question.
   A portion of the      success  of this Meteorological Department          of the
Board of Trade is certainly due to the facilities afforded by that
admirable institution, the Observatory at Kew, for the veri<U+FB01>cation
of the instruments supplied.           I  have already had occasion to ac
knowledge     the    obligations   which Science is under           to   the same
establishment     for supplying magnetic           and   meteorological     instru
ments, duly veri<U+FB01>ed, to various scienti<U+FB01>c expeditions             sent out both
by this and other countries.           Our debt of gratitude to this Obser
vatory and its able Superintendent, Mr. Welsh, is likely to be shortly
still further augmented by valuable improvements in the photo
graphic record of various phenomena, and among others, of the
spots on the sun’s disk; for the observation of which a telescope,
by Ross, has been lately erected.            Surely it is a cause  of great con
gratulation    that,   by means of the fund, the income of which was
placed at their disposal by the liberality of Dr. Wollaston and others,
your Council were able to render essential aid, and at the time of
its greatest need, to an Institution whose e<U+FB02>icient maintenance has
become a European         necessity,
   In taking    a general view       of the proceedings of the Institutions,
both in this and other countries, whose common object may be said
to be the increase of the happiness          of our species,  though by various
and widely di<U+FB01>erent methods, one cannot but be struck, <U+FB01>rst by the
great number       of such establishments and the inadequacy                of the
results obtained,     if  considered in reference to the means provided;
and, secondly, by the fact, that in the same country and at the same
time many different        bodies are at work in striving to produce the
same end    ;  but, instead    of combining their forces, they often inter
fere with each other’s operations; instead of helping one another,
they are perhaps even disposed sometimes to view with jealousy the
success   of their rivals.       Thus, to take an instance, let us consider
how many different bodies of men, o<U+FB02>icial or otherwise, are now
employed in attempting, but hitherto with little success, to diffuse
more widely among the inhabitants                of this favoured      island   the
blessings of education,        including    a knowledge      of the elements      of
the physical     sciences.     Let us re<U+FB02>ect for       a  moment      what   might
be the result      of  so   many   diiferent    currents   of intellectual    force,

                                                __—~35
if,   instead      of crossing and jostling one another in various direc
tions, they were to be forced to <U+FB02>ow in one harmonious                                          channel.
Surely,      when        so   much        is   at stake,          and    the     prize     to be          ob
tained      is   human        happiness,       some       attempt        at combination     might
be made, some             effort to bring together                a   portion     of the divergent
elements.          The Scienti<U+FB01>c           Board,     above         suggested, might            do some
good; Government                or    Parliament might                  do more;         but    it   is    to
social progress and the general improvement                              of our    species,        that we
must look for the complete realization                            of the hopes which every
good man         is    sometimes led to form of               a   happy future in store for his
race   ;   and obliged, as we are, in our course through life, to witness
so much that we have great cause                         to   regret, and scarcely any power
to mend, this re<U+FB02>ection               is   perhaps one            of our brightest and purest
consolations.
  The Copley Medal has been awarded to M. Chevreul for his im
portant investigations in Organic Chemistry, particularly for his
researches upon the nature and composition                                of the fats and <U+FB01>xed
oils, and for his physical                investigations          on the processes of dyeing,
including those on the simultaneous contrast of colours.
      Previous        to the researches        of M. Chevreul upon the fats,                        it   was
supposed          that    saponaceous compounds                     were combinations              of the
alkalies,        and     of oxide of lead with oils and fats; and, with the
exception of Schee1e’s               discovery, that glycerine was set free during
the process of saponi<U+FB01>cation,                   no precise chemical               knowledge upon
this subject existed.                            -
   The attention of M. Chevreul                       appears to have been directed to
this matter by his observation that, on diluting   solution of  par          a                      a
ticular soap largely with water, crystalline substance was separated
                                                a
in pearly scales;             upon     examining          the            of this crystalline
                                                                    nature
compound          he found      it   to consist      of   a    combination of alkali with                  a
peculiar fatty body of distinctly acid character.               Starting from this
point, he         was induced        to    examine the subject of saponi<U+FB01>cation in
emtenso;         the result     of his inquiries              was     the discovery        of   a    large
number       of new compounds, and                   a    masterly elucidation of the che
rnieal history         of the <U+FB01>xed oils,        fats, soaps,        and plasters.
      M. Chevreul         showed that ordinary                 fats and <U+FB01>xed oils consisted
                                                                                          D    2

mainly of three distinct compounds united in very various proportions.
One    of these compounds, oleine, is liquid at ordinary temperatures,
the other two, margarine and stearine, are solid; and, according as
the liquid or solid constituents preponderate, the body assumes the
consistence of oil, or of a fat less or more hard.   He also showed
that     each     of these three principles                             contains a distinct fatty acid
united with the basis of glycerine, the sweet principle                                            of oils; that,
when the fat or

             in of of
the basis               the glycerine             is   displaced, combining with water                           at   the
moment            its separation, thus forming true glycerine.                                         The fatty        or
oily acid               the meantime unites with the alkali                                  or   metallic oxide        :
when the alkalies are used   effect the saponification, soluble soaps
                                                    to
are found; when metallic oxides, such                zinc,   oxide of                     of

lead, are employed                   as     the saponifying             agents,      a    plaster,          insoluble
metallic soap,           is    formed.

         and may      said              be              to   have enabled Organic Chemistry                             to
become what   now is.    it
    At   the time when the researches                              of   M. Chevreul          were commenced,
 no    trustworthy process                        of    ultimate        organic          analysis       existed.       A
method       capable furnishing results, which, for accuracy, though
                               of
not for rapidity and facility                          of
                               execution, challenges comparison with
those     at    present        in       use,      was
                                                            by   him devised             and applied.            But     a
still more important                        aid   to    these inquiries was supplied.                           M. Che
vreul was the first                         perceive that the numerical results obtained by
ultimate        analysis        its of      an organic compound were not the only data
necessary                              to                                           he

                   recognizing and systematically introducing   this
leading principle into the methods   research practised     Organicof                                    in
Chemistry     due is M. Chevreul; and the important services which
                                   to
 he   has thus rendered                      to   the progress           of   Organic Chemistry are felt
more and more                  in     each succeeding year.                         Like other great men,
M.     Chevreul          was       in       advance         of    his   age, and         a   few       years elapsed

                                              37
     before his contemporaries         justly estimated and began to apply the
     principles   which he had introduced.
        But there is another side from which             these  researches must be
    viewed.       Few investigations in Organic Chemistry have been fraught
    with more important consequences to the industrial arts than these
    which     we are now considering.        New methods of obtaining hard and
    valuable fats from oils of low price          have been introduced,       and the
    method of manufacture adopted for the better descriptions of candles
    has been      entirely  altered.     A  new branch      of industry has indeed
    been created by these researches, since it is to them that we owe the
    introduction of what are known           as stearine or composite candles.
        The second important         subject with which the name of           M. Che
    vreul is permanently connected, is that           of the contrast of Colours.
    His investigation upon this subject has, like his earlier            one upon the
   fats, been regarded by all subsequent inquirers as the classical work
   upon the       series  of phenomena to which it relates.          In duly    appre
   ciating the importance of these inquiries,           it is necessary to consider
   both their purely scienti<U+FB01>c value and their direct practical bearing
   upon the art of the silk-dyer and the calico-printer,              to whom they
   have afforded invaluable          assistance, by the establishment         of <U+FB01>xed
   rules to guide them in the selection            of suitable and harmoniously
   contrasted tints, upon which so          much of the beauty of their dilferent
   fabrics depends.

       Transmit this Medal to M. Chevreul,            as the best   proof which     we
   can give of the value which we attach to his discoveries            ;  and express
   to him the grati<U+FB01>cation with which we have learnt that he is still
   engaged in the prosecution of scienti<U+FB01>c labours ; and our hope that

  enjoy the honour he has so deservedly obtained.
       One    of the Royal Medals has        been awarded to     Dr. Frankland.
       In   the year 1846, the question of the constitution          of the alcohols
  and certain allied organic bodies excited the deepest attention among
  chemists.        Dr. Kolbe had succeeded, by         a most ingenious       electro
  lytic process, in isolating the hitherto hypothetical radicals, valyl and
  methyl ; but the indirect nature of the reactions, by which these radi

                                                         38
cals were separated from valerianic and acetic acid, failed to convince
a large number            of contemporary chemists, who had contended for
some years against the existence                  Early in 1848,
                                                             of such radicals.
Dr. Frankland commenced his attempts to isolate these bodies by
direct and unexceptionable reactions. Taking the isolation of the
elementary radical, hydrogen, by the action of zinc upon hydriodic
acid, as his type, he succeeded,                        in the laboratory of Professor Bunsen
at Marburg, in isolating from their iodides the compound radicals
methyl, ethyl, and amyl; thus establishing                                      the complete homology
of these substances with hydrogen.
    The subsequent prosecution                            of      these       researches also           led    Dr.
Frankland to the discovery                         of    a new series            of remarkable          organic
compounds, containing   the metals zinc, tin, and mercury, united
with the radicals before mentioned. These metals had not been
previously       known         to enter into combinations                              of that    class.      The
compounds of zinc with methyl  and ethyl have, moreover, proved
most valuable bodies in the hands of Frankland,  Hofmann, and
others, for effecting substitutions                            which had previously                    been    im
practicable.
    The laborious            and         masterly            researches         of Bunsen on cacodyl
had      rendered this             most         remarkable             substance an object of the
highest interest to chemists;                           nevertheless,           its   isolated position, and
                                                                  its its
the complicated reactions attending                                     formation, stood           in   the way
of   any satisfactory          conclusion               as   to             rational    constitution.         The
study     of   the organo-metallic bodies containing zinc, tin, and mercury,
and   of   those discovered                by
                              Löwig and others, led Dr. Frankland                                                  to
a   generalization, which grouped cacodyl and the rest  those organo                       of
metallic       compounds            into    a      harmonious                family,     and according             to
which these substances are formed upon the types                                           of    the inorganic
compounds         of   the respective metals with oxygen, sulphur, and other
similar bodies.
     In   the hands        by of   Dr. Frankland, this theory has already borne
fruit.     Guided                  it,   he     has succeeded                 in    replacing     the oxygen
                                           of by
of   binoxide        of   nitrogen,                ethyl and methyl,                   thus obtaining          two
members         ofa   new series                acids; while the formation,                       by   one    ofhis
pupils,     of   two new organic                    derivations              from      sulphurous       acid,      is
another result         of   the same important generalization.

       DR. FRANKLAND,
   Accept this Medal        as the appropriate           reward of researches, which
have excited the greatest interest among all those who cultivate or
appreciate     the science which you have so materially                     advanced and
adorned.
   The other Royal Medal has been awarded to Dr. Lindley,                                in
recognition       of the value of his labours in various branches of Scien
ti<U+FB01>c Botany; and more especially for his learned and comprehensive
works on the Natural Orders of Plants, on Orchideae, and on theo
retical and practical Horticulture.
  The eminent position           which Dr. Lindley has attained amongst
naturalists,      is founded upon a knowledge                  of the Vegetable King
dom,      in the most extended       sense         of that term, such         as few have
acquired; the result of many years of diligent research and con
tinued study of the structure, morphology, and development of
plants     from                           To the knowledge thus ob
                   every part of the globe.
tained, he has applied the resources of an original and vigorous
intellect, and a quick appreciation of a<U+FB01>inities; and he has embodied
the results    of his labours in    a series        of works upon the a<U+FB02>inities of
plants, which are alike remarkable for the clearness                    of their arrange
ment, the lucidity of their style, and the in<U+FB02>uence                         they have had
upon the progress of philosophical Botany. In these labours we
recognize with satisfaction the evidence of his regarding systematic
Botany in its true light,         as the sister science       of the Comparative
Anatomy of animals; and, like                it,   depending for the value of its
results    upon the number         and variety,           as    well   as   the   complete
ness     and accuracy     of the naturalist’s            observations,      and upon his
powers     of combination.
  In      the systematic     investigation         of the Orchideous          plants,   Dr.
Lindley has devoted himself during                  a   long series of years to one of
the most difficult branches of Descriptive Botany. The species of
this remarkable and extensive natural order are of singularly com      a
plicated structure—the clue to their a<U+FB02>inities lies in minute organs;
and as by far the greater number of species are only to be obtained
for study in dried and mutilated state, their investigation demands
                  a
an amount of patience and skill in microscopic analysis, such as very
few botanists have devoted to similar inquiries.

        In    the science        of Horticulture Dr. Lindley has also taken the
highest position; nor is  it too much to say, that it is mainly due to
his efforts that this branch of knowledge has risen from the con
dition of an empirical art to that of a developed science.      In no
department have his labours been more widely appreciated than in
this; not only because, up to a very recent period, the ignorance of
sound principles             and the prevalence                  of injudicious practice retarded
the progress of scientific horticulture,                             but because these evils could
only be remedied by                       one   combining             that knowledge                  of scientific
Botany and of gardening operations which he possesses.                                                    To these
requirements              he has added the power                    of studying the results of
experimental research by means                              of those laws of climate in   rela               its
tions        to   horticulture,       which had previously been                       so   ably expounded
 byour late illustrious Fellow, Professor Daniell.  pursuing these                       In
inquiries, Dr. Lindley has displayed the same ready facility   ap                                             in
plying his varied knowledge                          to   the investigation      of   difficult problems,
which characterizes his works                         on    the affinities      of   plants.
I         may also briefly allude                    to    Dr. Lindley's numerous elementary

                 Obituary Notices    of  deceased Fellows.
    HENRY James Bnooxn was born at Exeter on the 25th of May,
 1771. His relations were engaged in the manufacture of broad-cloth.
After having received an ordinary scholastic education, he studied for
the bar, and had very nearly completed the usual period, when the
prospect   of advantageous connexions with the manufacturing <U+FB01>rms in
the west of England induced him to engage in the Spanish wool trade
in London, for which object he spent nearly two years in Spain.
    The precise habit of thought and expression which the active study
of the law must necessarily induce, was perhaps mainly instrumental
 in imparting the tone of extreme precision by which all his subsequent
acts and observations were characterized.
    Soon after he took up his residence in London, in the year 1802,
his attention was turned to the subjects of Mineralogy, Geology, and
Botany; and to the two former of these sciences, then in their in
fancy, the greater portion   of his leisure hours was devoted.      He was
elected a Fellow     of the Geological Society in 1815, of the Linnean
in 1818, and of the Royal Society in 1819.              He served on the
Council of the Royal Society in 1842-44.
    Mr. Brooke was associated with the late Mr. Henry Hase, cashier
of the Bank of England, and others in the establishment of the
London Life Assurance Association, the commercial success of which
bears ample testimony to the soundness of the principles on which
it was established.
    On the decline of the Spanish wool trade, which was superseded in
a great measure by that with Germany, Mr. Brooke sought a com
mercial pursuit more congenial to his tastes, and devoted his energies
to the establishment of companies to work the mines of South Ame
rica; but in these undertakings      the fairest prospects were blighted
by an entire absence of good faith abroad, and failure was the inevit
able result.    After this period he accepted the of<U+FB01>ce of secretary to
the London Life Association, the duties of which he discharged for
many years; and -on his retirement,       the appreciation   of his services
by the Society    was evinced by the grant    of a liberal annuity.
    During   a period  of several years, his devotion to his favourite
pursuits was much interfered with by the result of an accident :-—he

                                        42
was knocked       down by a horse suddenly turning the comer of a road
near his residence at Stockwell, and the fall produced                   a   slight con
cussion    of the brain; after which, for           a considerable           period, his
accustomed mental          efforts were followed    by sleeplessness and other
symptoms of undue cerebral excitement.    During this period, <U+FB01>nding
absolute inaction extremely irksome, he sought pursuits which would
occupy his hands, with less demand on the brain than those to which
he had been devoted.           He formed     a large collection         of shells, but
feeling    the pursuit to be objectless,      if   irrespective    of the structure
and functions      of their living tenants, be abandoned          it,   and presented
the collection      to the University of Cambridge.               Mr. Brooke then
became     a         of engravings,—having in early life imbibed
               collector                                                                a
taste for art, and exercised that of water-colour drawing. These he
was so successful in cleaning and restoring, that when, having so far
recovered as to resume his original pursuits, he disposed of his collec
tion, the aggregate value was greatly augmented, notwithstanding the
presentation      of some specimens of rare excellence to the national
collection in the     British Museum.
  Having been blessed to the last with an unusually perfect enjoy
ment of his faculties, his favourite studies were actively pursued until
a very short period before his decease, which occurred from natural
decay, accelerated by the depression           of the system produced              by   a
severe cold, on the 26th        of June, 1857.
  The     Familiar Introduction to Crystallography,’ the <U+FB01>rst system
          ‘
atic treatise on this branch of science, was published in 1823.    In
this, following the steps of Haiiy, he referred            the existing forms           of
crystals to an unnecessarily large number of primary forms; but the
trigonometrical relations of the various             existing     plane surfaces        of
crystals were then <U+FB01>rst clearly traced out.
   In     the subsequent     treatise on Crystallography published in the
Encyclopaedia Metropolitana, the former system was much simpli
<U+FB01>ed and the number of primary forms reduced to six, which, differing
essentially from each other, correspond with the six systems generally
adopted by continental        crystallographers.
   The discovery and description         of thirteen new mineral species are
due to Mr. Brooke’s researches: to these may be added two others,
the published descriptions of which were just anticipated, in point of
time, by those of continental         mineralogists.      These notices will be

                                       43
found in the pages of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals, and of
the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal.
    He was the <U+FB01>rst to make extensive use of the re<U+FB02>ective goniometer
in determining the forms of the crystals of arti<U+FB01>cial salts. The An
nals of Philosophy for 1823 contain the determination             of the forms
of no less than <U+FB01>fty-<U+FB01>ve different laboratory          crystals,—a work of
much persevering labour.         If only  the chemical composition     of these
salts had been accurately known in England at the time, their mea
sures would have served as a basis whereon to found the theory of
 Isomorphism.
     The treatise on Mineralogy in the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana
 was the <U+FB01>rst systematic work on the subject with which the name of
 Mr. Brooke is associated.         This was originally intended to have
 been a very complete treatise, but repeated editorial          remonstrances
 on account of want    of  space   compelled our author to cut it down to
 little more than   a mere catalogue       of minerals, with   a few   of their
 more important    chemical characters.       The only complete treatise on
 Mineralogy with which his name is connected is the recent re-edition
 or rather reproduction of W. Phillips’s treatise, in conjunction with
 Professor W. H. Miller, who took upon himself by far the greater
 portion of the labour incidental to publication.
     It may be here remarked        that  Mr. Brooke entertained a strong
 impression   of the desirableness of rendering the study of crystal
 lography more attainable to many, whose minds          are not so habituated
 to the abstractions   of analysis    as to contemplate    a plane merely as
 the geometrical impersonation of a.z'+ by + cz=O        : this object he pro
 posed to attain by means of a more direct reference           of the existing
 planes  of crystals to simple geometrical, or primary, forms than the
 last-mentioned   treatise presents.
     Mr. Brooke’s latest efforts were directed to the general relations
 and geometrical    similarity of all crystals belonging      to the same sy
  stem.   A paper on this subject, read before the Royal Society, which
  was in the press at the time of his decease, contains a comparison of
  the forms of all known minerals belonging to the Rhombohedral and
  Pyramidal systems, and will probably be found to throw             some   new
 light on the theory of Isomorphism.
     His unrivalled collection of minerals, comprising the choicest speci
 mens that he could, with ample opportunities,          collect during half a

                                          44
  century, has been presented to the University            of Cambridge, as the
  best means of rendering       it subservient to the advancement of mine
  r alogical science.
      M. Aucusrm C.wcur* had the good fortune to belong to that
  middle class of society which is neither exposed to the miseries of
  poverty nor to the temptations of wealth.               His father was Archi
  viste-Secrétaire of the Sénat Conservateur              from about 1800 or
   1801, and of the Chamber of Peers from 1814 to 1830.                   Of two
  brothers,    both   younger     than    himself,   one became an      ornament
  to the highest     court of justice, to which he was promoted, and the
  other succeeded his father as Secrétaire-Archiviste           to the Chamber
  of Peers.       Augustin Cauchy was born on the 21st of August,
  1789.     His classical education commenced early under his father,
  and    was   continued    afterwards      by  able   teachers   at  the   Ecole
  centrale du Pantheon.        He left this school in 1804, at the age of
  <U+FB01>fteen, carrying off the second prize for Latin composition, and the
  <U+FB01>rst for Greek and Latin verse. This success procured for him the
  wreath    given   to the best classic among         the pupils   of the lilcole
  centrale.    After having attended for one year only the public mathe
 matical lectures of an excellent Professor, Dinet, Cauchy felt himself
 quali<U+FB01>ed to enter the examination         of candidates for admission to the
 Ecole Polytechnique.        He   was admitted,      being second on the list,
 in 1805, at the      age  of sixteen years; and at the end of the two
 years’ course, he came out third in 1807.             On quitting the school
 he adopted the career of the Ponts et Chanssées, in which he passed
 rapidly through the inferior grades, was employed in many works,
 and became ingénieur en chef in l825.
    On the 6th of May, 1811, at the              age  of twenty-two years, he
 presented to the mathematical           class of the Institute, a very re
 markable memoir on the polyhedron of geometry, and completed
the theory      of  a new   kind    of regular polyhedrons       discovered   by
M. Poinsot.        Legendre,   a most      austere judge, regarded this me
moir   as the production     of well-exercised powers which promised in
due time the highest success.         He urged the young author to follow
out these researches, and to endeavour to establish a certain              theo

  rem not previously         demonstrated.       Cauchy    obtained   it in 1812.
  Legendre     reported    on it to the Academy with an enthusiasm very
  foreign to his character.         “We   only intended,”     he said,     “ to give
  an idea of this demonstration,        and have extracted almost the whole
 of it.    We have thus furnished          a new     proof of the sagacity with
  which this young geometer has succeeded in conquering a difficulty
  which had arrested the progress of the masters of the art, and
  which it was of importance to solve in order to complete the theory
  of the solid bodies.”         These <U+FB01>rst two memoirs of Cauchy seemed
  to foretell a peculiar and exclusive aptitude for pure geometry              ;  but
  it was soon discovered that his genius had              a much     wider range.
  In   the years 1813 and 1814 he produced               two remarkable       analy-
  tical memoirs, and in 1815 he presented a memoir on the theory                   of
  numbers, in which he proved and extended a theorem enunciated                    by
  Fermat,    a theorem      some   particular   cases  of which only had been
  established by the most able writers in that department of mathe
  matical    science, Legendre       and Gauss.       He published      an elegant
  theorem on the number         of values which    a function  can assume, when
  the letters which     it contains are interchanged.        Twenty years later,
   this theorem enabled the celebrated Abel to prove the impossibility
   of solving algebraic equations of the <U+FB01>fth or higher degrees.                   In
   the same     year, the Academy proposed,         as the subject    of the great
   mathematical     prize, the investigation     of the theory of the propaga
   tion of waves on the surface of a heavy <U+FB02>uid of inde<U+FB01>nite depth.
   Cauchy gave a complete solution of the problem.                   His memoir,
   which obtained the prize in 1816, has for its motto the line of
_
   Virgil—
               “ Nosse quot Ionii veniant ad littora <U+FB02>uctus.”—Georg.   ii.
   A peculiarly   happy quotation, as the line may be said to contain a
   striking enunciation of the problem proposed.
      This fertility in a young man of seven-and-twenty                would     have
   secured for him the <U+FB01>rst place which became vacant in the Mathe
  matical    Section    of the Institute.     He   was   admitted   into it under
   circumstances     much     to be regretted.      After the short crisis of       a
  hundred days,       a  royal ordinance,    dated March 21,        1816, re-esta
  blished the old Academies under their original names,—the Academy
   of France, of Sciences, of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres, of the

                                                         46
Fine Arts, -and also appointed the members of the restored Acade
mies.      In the Academy of Sciences, two celebrated                                         names, those               of
Carnot and Monge, were replaced by two new names, Breguet and
Cauchy.          The opinion                 of men of science was indulgent                                  towards
Breguet, but severe towards Cauchy.
  Towards the end of 1815 he was appointed Assistant-Professor of
Analysis at the École Polytechnique; he became titular Professor
in 1816.          It    was      impossible for any man to be more zealous than
Cauchy in discharging the duties imposed upon him.                                                 Appointed to
teach, he turned                 all   his thoughts           to   the art      of      teaching.            Between
                              he   published                               of   Algebraic Analysis,

In     the same interval                    he   published         a    memoir           on   integrals            taken
between imaginary limits, which has been the foundation                                                 of   import

analysts      of      our times, wrote             to   one   of   his friends, “Cauchy                      is,   of    all
others, the geometer who best understands how mathematics ought
to  be studied.”      fact, the discoveries
                                   In          methods and the                   of
sketches       of      new views, scattered through these ‘Exercises,                                               have
been not only               to   the author, but also                     to   many other geometers,
the fertile initiative                 of   brilliant    researches.             Cauchy continued                       the
nurture and publication                     of   this mathematical treasury                     up      to   the time
of his death.
     The calm flow            of his existence was unexpectedly disturbed   the                                    by
Revolution            of   1830.    At this epoch                  he
                                                     was married and the father
of   two daughters.              He had allied himself with                       an     honourable family,
whose social position, tastes and sentiments were     harmony with                        in
 his
   own.   Besides                  his
                       Professorship    the École Polytechnique,at                                                       he

                                       47
 <U+FB01>lled a chair  in the Faculté    des Sciences de    Paris, and was Assistant
 Professor of Mathematics applied to Physics, at the College de France.
 The new government thought proper to establish its titlebto power de
facto by an oath of allegiance imposed upon all public functionaries,
 even on those who had no duty beyond that of teaching the mathe
 matical   and   physical sciences. Cauchy took refuge in Switzer
land in order to preserve his loyalty to Charles X. unimpeached.                 ~
 The presence of     so distinguished     a geometer    in the country of the
 Bernoullis and of Euler could not remain long concealed.             The king
 of Sardinia, informed of his voluntary exile, created for him a chair
 of mathematics at Turin, the duties of which Cauchy discharged
 with éclat, pursuing at the       same   time his other researches.      Thus
 France lost one of her most illustrious geometers, and             one  of the
 most able   of her Professors.      In  1832 Cauchy was elected a Foreign
 Member of the Royal Society.           In  the same year he was invited to
 Prague by Charles X., to take a part in the education of the Count de
 Chambord. He sent for his wife and two daughters, and with them
 followed the princes to Goritz      ; and during the six years devoted to
 this honourable     employment      found leisure to write a multitude      of
 valuable memoirs on various parts of mathematics,            which, scattered
 throughout Germany, are not easy to obtain.             He took leave of his
 pupil in 1837, returned to France, and resumed his place in the
 Institute, which, contrary to rule, had been left vacant,--protected
 by the admiration which the genius of its possessor inspired.
 From this period, his studies being no longer disturbed by the duty
 of teaching, his mathematical labours being never interrupted except
 when    engaged in works       of charity, Cauchy poured forth at the
 meetings of the Institute the inexhaustible abundance of his mathe
 matical genius.      During the last nineteen years of his life, be com
 posed and published in the volumes of the Academy or in the
 ‘
   Comptes Rendus,’      more than 500 memoirs, besides a multitude          of
 reports on memoirs presented by others.            Of this immense     mass  of
 labour, many parts have a great value         of their own   ;  others present
 the initiative  of ideas and of methods, which have been or will at           a
 later time   be fertile.    All   bear upon     the highest    departments of
 mathematics,    the perfection     and extension    of pure analysis, the in
 vestigation and direct determination        of the planetary movements and
 of their most complicated       inequalities, the theory of the undulatory

movement of light, considered in                               its     utmost generality.                    Unfortu
nately, this haste                in   production       did not leave him patience                               to   bring
his works           to     maturity.         Each new way that presented itself                                      to    his
mind occupied him exclusively;                           and       in     order      to   follow      it    he   quitted
that which            he   had begun         to   explore, even without taking time                                   to   see
to    what     it   would lead.              For the         sake       of     proceeding more rapidly,
he almost always                  condensed       his    new researches                  in      an   unusual nota
tion, which rendered them unintelligible                                       to   everybody but himself;
and often           he     did not discover that these innovations only disguised
under some strange form results already known.
                                                                                                                            by by
     In    1840          place     in   the Bureau des Longitudes became vacant
                    of a
                                                                       of of

Cauchy was unanimously elected,                              but declined    take the oathto                                of
                                                                   Philippe,

allegiance          to     the government                    Louis           consequently  his
election        was         not     ratified.                1843 Cauchy                  was         commissioned
by       the Academy              to   verify     the determination                      of      an   inequality            of
long period              in   the       planetary motions.                      M. Leverrier announced
the discovery,              in    the motion        of       the planet Pallas having                              period
of                                                                                                          of a
         795 years.             Its maximum             effect upon the longitude                                    Pallas
exceeds         15', according              to   the calculations                   of   M. Leverrier.                    For
want       of   a   direct analytical             method,            he   had determined                   its   amount
by    extremely bold numerical
          an                                                  interpolation               which required                    an
immense amount of calculation.                                    In      order          toavoid the trouble
                      it,   Cauchy invented                                                                     by   which

         inequalities       of    this kind can              be   determined              in   every case.                 He
obtained the same coefficient                           as   that found                  by   M. Leverrier,               and
from that time,                  in    problems     of       this kind, the power                          of    abstract
science replaced individual exertion.                                  In      1848 Cauchy resumed the
Mathematical                Professorship          in    the Faculté des Sciences                            de       Paris,
the only one               of   his former posts which remained unoccupied.                                                In
1851 Cauchy    resigned this Professorship for the second time, but
soon afterwards, the Minister   Public Instruction, M. Fortoul, easily
                                                   of
obtained permission                     from the Emperor                    for Cauchy                toresume his
Chair unfettered                  by   any condition              or   political         test.        He expressed
his gratitude for this indulgence                        by   devoting the whole
                                                        the income                                    of
 hereceived from the Faculté des Sciences   charitable purposes                 to                                         in
the little Commune     Sceaux,         of
                               where he resided.   Once, when the

                                        49
Maire, who was the dispenser of his charities, expressed some aston
ishment on seeing him so prodigal, he exclaimed, “ Be not alarmed,
it is the Emperor who pays.”
    Cauchy’s determination of the number of real and imaginary roots
of any algebraic equation; his rigorous method of calculating ap
proximately the same roots ; his new theory of the symmetric func
tions of the coe<U+FB02>icients of equations of any degree whatsoever; his
1)-prion‘ valuation  of a quantity   less than the least difference between
the roots of an equation      ;  his mathematical     theory   of light, and
especially of dispersion; his 12-priori determination,     without any pre
vious photometric     observations, without any data besides two angles,
of the quantity of light re<U+FB02>ected at the surfaces of metals,-have
placed him among the number of the truly creative minds, and have
made him the illustrious chief of a new mathematical           school, much
superior in its aims to the school of Laplace his master, or that of
his rival, Poisson.
    A  classical education  had developed his natural       aptitude  for the
study of languages.       At Turin he lectured in Italian; at the      age of
<U+FB01>fty-three he learned Hebrew, that he might assist his father in
some scriptural researches in which he was engaged.
    In the sitting of the Institute on the 4th of May, 1857, M. Cauchy
read a second memoir on the employment           in astronomy of coe<U+FB01>icient
regulators, an employment which constitutes an arti<U+FB01>ce in analysis
on which he founded the greatest hopes and which he classed among
the happiest of his discoveries.       He was present at the sitting of the
 llth  of May, but was suffering from a bad cold; his family and
friends perceived with grief that he appeared much weakened, and
that his features were changed.          On Tuesday, the 12th of May, he
repaired    to his pleasant    residence at Sceaux.      He was unable to
leave his room, yet nothing indicated his approaching          end.   He was
continually occupied with the new developments in series, for which
he was indebted to his regulator, and he completed the programme
of his lectures at the Faculté des Sciences. On Thursday, the 21st
of May, he conversed for some time with the Archbishop of Paris.
His weakness increased on Friday, but he slept well that night; he
awoke at three o’clock on Saturday morning, the 25th of May, in a
state of great feebleness, and in about half an hour expired, appa
rently without pain.

   The Rev. WILLIAM DANIEL                                    CoNYBEARE,                 Dean of Llandaff,
was born in London, 7th June, 1787, and died 12th August, 1857,
aged     71.     The family                 name       has been for some                  time honourably
connected with the Church of England.       His father was Rector of
St. Botolph, Bishopsgate.
   Following at a short interval, in Oxford, the academical progress
of his brother John Josias Conybeare, and his friend William Buck
land,     he speedily associated himself in their mineralogical                                              and
geological studies, contributed actively to the growth                                       of the Oxford
Museum, and assisted in the early labours of the Geological Society.
He explored personally much of the country round Oxford, and
examined the north of Ireland, the vicinity of Bath and Bristol, and
the coasts of Dorset, Devon, and South Wales.
   Organic remains attracted his attention in the early part of his
career.        In 1814 he presented to the Geological Society remarks on
some     singular         impressions              occurring       in    flint*; in          1821, he was
associated with De la Beche in the discovery                                      of a   new fossil animal,
forming a link between the Ichthyosaurus                                 and the          Crocodilet; and
in 1824, completed this investigation on the almost perfect skeleton
of the Plesiosaurust.
   In    these papers Conybeare opened a new and very fertile field                                        of
research, and cultivated                    it   with success;          manifesting so much             know
ledge     of   anatomy and the skeleton                         of reptiles,        as to    win from the
great author         of    the ‘Ossemens Fossiles’ the free adoption of his                                  con
clusions, novel and startling as they appeared.                                      Whoever will now
read the admirable descriptions by Owenof this extinct reptile, or
strive for himself to recompose from the ordinary fragments in
museums         its   strange figure,                  will    revere    the early and successful
labours    of   Conybeare, and comprehend                               in   how high       a   degree they
have helped forward the Palaeontology   Britain.                   of

geology, he gave to the Geological Society in 1816 *, “Notices of the
Sections presented by the Cliffs of Antrim and Derry,” the fruit of a
tour with Buckland, whom he also accompanied to Germany.        In
1822 appeared the <U+FB01>rst volume of the Geology of England and Wales,’
                                    ‘
in which the names of W. Phillips and W. D. Conybeare occur
together,—a most valuable work, of which the weightiest parts were
contributed by Conybeare.             Strange that thirty-five years elapsed in
the life of the author, without drawing from his hand the second part of
that capital work—not less remarkable the fact, that the                      deep respect
of English geologists prevented any other hand from taking up the
pen to complete         the work he had begun so well.                      Among other
contributions     to his favourite science may be mentioned, Memoirs on
the Hydrographical Basin              of the Thames 1',—on the Structure                         of

his daily conversation; no one hailed with more delight the ‘dis

science    in other parts of Europe.           Perhaps nowhere can he found,

    Dean Conybeare was a Corresponding Member of the Institute            of
 France; he was admitted Fellow of the Royal Society in 1819, but
 he was not a contributor to the Philosophical Transactions.
    Dr. MARSHALL HALL was born at Basford in Nottinghamshire,
 in the year 1790.     His father is stated to have    been a man   of supe
rior ability, and to have made considerable attainments in chemistry
and mechanics, whereby he was enabled to introduce           improvements
into the cotton-spinning trade in which he was engaged.
    Dr. Hall received his early education at Nottingham and Newark,
and at the age of twenty entered on the study of medicine at the
 University of Edinburgh, where three years later, in 1812, he took
his degree. For the next two years he held the o<U+FB02>ice of Clinical
                                    ‘
Clerk (or as it is now termed, Resident Physician’) in the Royal
In<U+FB01>rmary of that city, after which, with a view to further professional
improvement, he visited Paris, Berlin, Giittingen, Giessen, and other
medical    schools of the Continent     of Europe.     Having commenced
practice in Nottingham in 1815, he was appointed           Physician to the
 General Hospital there, and rapidly rose to eminence.
    During the ten years that Dr. Hall followed his profession in his        i
native county, his mind was actively engaged in scienti<U+FB01>c pursuits ;
and it was at this time that he communicated          to the Medical and
Chirurgical Society of London his well-known memoir “On the
Effects of the Loss of Blood,” subsequently published as a separate
work, which was directed against the practice, at that time prevalent,
of what the author considered    excessive  depletion in in<U+FB02>ammatory    and
supposed in<U+FB02>ammatory       disorders.
    Having already earned    a name   in the medical profession, Dr. Hall,
in 1826, transferred himself to London.         His career   as a physician
in the metropolis was eminently successful,      so  that he was enabled at
the age  of sixty to release himself from strictly professional labour.
    Amid the cares and duties of a London physician’s life, Dr. Hall

                                       53
  continued to apply himself assiduously       to original scienti<U+FB01>c research,
 and physiology, especially in its relations to medicine, was his favourite
 pursuit.      In  1831 he
                                          “
                           published his Essay on the Circulation of the
  Blood,” which contains observations on the <U+FB02>ow of blood in the
 capillary    vessels  of Batrachia and Fishes, and on the characters by
 which these vessels      are distinguished from arteries and veins.        On
 this occasion he made known his discovery of a remarkable pulsa
                                ” connected with the vessels in the tail of
 ting sac or “caudal heart
 the eel.   The results of further physiological inquiries were published
 in the Philosophical Transactions for 1832, in two papers, one “On
 the Inverse Ratio which subsists between the Respiration and           Irrita
 bility in the Animal Kingdom,” the other         “ On Hybernation ;” and
 a few years later he contributed the articles “Hybernation” and
 “Irritability” to Dr. Todd’s Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology.
    But his name will hereafter be best known in connexion with the
 doctrine   of the Re<U+FB02>ex Function of the Nervous System, which was
 his most engrossing subject of pursuit for the last twenty-five         years
 of his life.    In the Philosophical Transactions for 1833 appeared his
 “ Memoir on the Re<U+FB02>ex Function of the Medulla
                                                          oblongata and Me
 dulla spinalis,” the object of which is to show that certain involun
 tary acts previously designated    as
                                       “ sympathetic motions ” are excited
 by impressions made on the extremities of certain nerves, and con
 ducted by them to the spinal marrow and medulla oblongata, whence
 as from   a centre they are re<U+FB02>ected on the motor        nerves of the parts
 moved; that these motions are concerned especially in various func
tions which are ‘necessary for the preservation of the individual or of
the species, and that they are independent           alike of sensation and
volition; moreover, that the      “ tone
                                         ”  of the muscular system belongs
to the same order of phenomena and depends on the spinal marrow;
lastly, that the re<U+FB02>ex function may be exalted or depressed by medi
cinal agents, and in its abnormal or morbid conditions give rise to
various well-known spasmodic, convulsive, and other nervous diseases.
    Dr. Hall admitted that the phenomena of which he treated had
long been known to physiologists, but he believed himself to have
been the <U+FB01>rst to show their independence of sensation, to bring them
together under one generalization, to establish with precision the laws
of their production, to assign them their just rank in physiology, and
to apply the doctrine to the elucidation of disease. But while we do

                                              5%
not question the sincerity          of Dr. Hall's conviction of his own origi
nality, there can     be no doubt that he was much more largely anticipated
by preceding physiologists than he could ever be brought to recognize;
and this not only in the observation,       but in the generalization and
physiological applicationof the phenomena, and, in short, in all essential
parts of the doctrine, such at least as are likely to maintain their ground.
This, however, being admitted, it is equally true that from the time
this subject was taken up by Dr. Hall, the physiology and pathology
of the nervous system may almost be said to have entered into a new
phase.   With all the ardour of a discoverer persuaded of being the
founder of a great and in<U+FB02>uential doctrine, he thenceforth                    made the
re<U+FB02>ex, or, as he subsequently called               it,   the excito-motory   system, his
chief study, and laboured incessantly in extending and consolidating its
province for the rest of his life; and to him belongs especially the merit
of successfully applying the principle to the interpretation of disease.
By his numerous writings and unwearied personal exertions, atten
tion was awakened on all sides to the importance of the phenomena                         ;
and they soon became         a             of intelligent observation
                                   prominent subject
and earnest discussion among physiologists and medical men both in
this country and on the Continent, where Professor Miiller had inde
pendently and almost simultaneously                  arrived at results in great part
similar to those of Dr. Hall, though he was somewhat later in publi
cation.      In   this way the principle of the re<U+FB02>ex function has come to
take its due_ place in physiology and medicine, and important truths,
previously seen or at least comprehended in their systematic connexion
only by     a   few, are now established and familar doctrines in science.
  Four years after the date of his <U+FB01>rst memoir, Dr. Hall communi
cated   a   second paper to the Royal Society, which formed the subject
of the Bakerian Lecture for 1837.In this paper, which was entitled
“ On  the True Spinal Marrow, and the Excito-motory System of
Nerves,” he gave new exposition of the constitution of the nervous
                        a
                                                                                    ”
system, on the assumption              that    there       are special   “excitor       and
       ” nerve-<U+FB01>bres subservient
“motor                           to the re<U+FB02>ex function, and dif
ferent from the sensory and volunto-motory <U+FB01>bres, though mixed with
them    in   the same sheaths      ;   and that these special nerve-<U+FB01>bres are            in
relation to     a   special part   of the spinal marrow and of its encephalic
prolongations,       which   serves as   a    centre, anatomically        blended with,
but physiologically distinct from, the part of the cord ministering to

                                     55
sensation and volition.      Opinion was much divided      as to the validity
of this hypothesis, and the subsequent progress of inquiry cannot be
said to have been on the whole favourable         to it.  In   the same me
moir Dr. Hall adduces observations and experiments to show that
the ordinary (but not voluntary) movements of respiration are excited
in  a re<U+FB02>ex manner    through the medulla oblongata, and do not ema
nate from that part as their primum mobile, as he had previously
conceived in common with most preceding            and contemporary       phy
siologists.   This second memoir was not inserted in the Philosophical
Transactions,    which was ever after   a subject   of grievance with the
author; but in point of fact the original matter contained in it had
                                                                ‘
 already been made public by Dr. Hall himself in his Lectures on
the Nervous System and its Diseases,’ published          in 1836; and his
new experiments and amended views respecting the respiratory move
ments had also been communicated by him to the Zoological Society
and published     in their ‘              ’
                                            in 1834: it subsequently

publication by the author, under the title of Memoirs on the Ner
vous System,’ 4to, 1837.
    Dr. Hall’s further researches and later views in Neuro-physiology
 are to be found chie<U+FB02>y in his    ‘
                                    New Memoir on the Nervous System,’
  1843, and his ‘Synopsis of the Diastaltic Nervous System,’ which
is an outline of the Croonian Lectures delivered by him at the Col
 lege  of Physicians in 1850.     His more strictly professional writings
 are many and valuable; they appeared partly as independent             publi
 cations, and partly in Journals and in Transactions       of Societies  ; but
 it would exceed our limits to give even the titles of the numerous and
 varied productions of his fertile genius, active temperament and ready
 pen.    The more important of them are indicated in the obituary
 memoirs of Dr. Hall which have appeared in the medical journals;
 but we cannot thus pass over his last service rendered to the cause
 of humanity, in the introduction of a simple and easily applied method
of restoring suspended respiration, which, if       we may   trust the posi
tive testimony <U+FB02>owing in on all hands, has already been the means
of rescuing many from untimely death.
    In 1853 Dr. Hall paid a visit to America, but in the mean time            a
severe and exhausting complaint under which he had long suffered
was gaining upon him, and to escape           its aggravation     by our less

of life at length succumbed, and he died at Brighton on the 11th of
August, 1857.
  Dr. Hall was              a member          of the Institute of France, and of most of
the learned societies of Europe and America.The date of his elec
tion into the Royal Society is April 5, 1832; he served on the
Council in 1850–52.

   From London he went                     in                                  in   Cornwall, and there,

besides obtaining               a   high degree                medical reputation,                 he   became
eminent      in      mineralogical            and geological             researches;          he   proposed,

contributed           to,   the Royal Geological Society                      of   Cornwall.        His con
tributions comprise papers                      “On    a   Recent Formation                   of   Sandstone

   Geological   Structure of Cornwall,” &c.          A valuable paper         on the

     Dr. Paris returned       to London    in 1817.        In   the course of an
 honourable and successful career       of practice, he was elected President
of the Royal College of Physicians, on the death of Sir Henry Hal
 ford, after serving repeatedly in the o<U+FB01>ice of Censor.                 Finally, in
 the full possession of his mental powers, and to the last moment
 devoted to the interests        of the College, which he loved, Dr. Paris
 departed this life,   June 24, 1857, under very painful disease,     I
                                                                          borne by
him with great constancy.
     Dr. Paris was elected     a  Fellow of the Royal Society in 1821, and
repeatedly served on the Council.
     His works were numerous, and obtained            a large   circulation.    The
 ‘Treatise on Medical Jurisprudence,’ published in conjunction with
Mr. Fonblanque, 1825; the ‘Treatise on Diet,’ 1827; the ‘Life of
Sir Humphry Davy,’ 1831, a most felicitous instance of perfect bio
                                               ‘
graphy; his delightful little book,              Philosophy in Sport made
Science in Earnest.’         But, greatest of all in its originality and prac
tical usefulness, though earliest in its appearance, was Dr. Paris’s
 ‘                  ’
   Pharmacologia      ;  it came out <U+FB01>rst  as a small volume        in 1812.     On
this last work,    if  he had published      nothing    else,  his claims,    as en
larging the science of medicine, might safely be rested.
    The Rev. \Vu.r.rAM Scomcssv,            son of the well-known whaling
captain, was born at Crofton near Whitby in 1789.               At the  age  of ten,
having been taken on a farewell visit to his father, who was about to
set out on a voyage, he was so delighted          with all he saw in the ship,
that he contrived      a boyish   scheme for remaining on board, and thus
unpremeditatedly       began his acquaintance with the sea.           Some   of the
incidents   of this voyage, and among them the clever               escape from a
                                     ‘
hostile cruiser, are related in        Memorials of the     Sea,’   a book   which
he published <U+FB01>fty years afterwards.           The voyage made him            a con
<U+FB01>rmed     sailor,  and from 1803 he accompanied               his father    in the

                                     58
Resolution for eight years, and manifested his diligence and turn for
observation by keeping a regular journal in addition to his other
duties.     The fact that  he won the responsible post     of <U+FB01>rst mate of
the ship while yet in his sixteenth year, and that he was appointed
commander in 1811, as soon as he became         of legal age, supplies  good
testimony as to his courage and skill in his adventurous        profession.
    It  was during this period, in 1806, that the Scoresbys sailed to
a higher north latitude than, in the absence of trustworthy evidence
to the contrary, had ever before been reached.         Steering northwards
from the western coast of Spitzbergen,        they found an open sea, in.
which they not only captured as many whales as furnished a full
cargo, but found on one occasion their position to be 81° 30' N.,
about 510 miles from the Pole.       The   sea was then so clear,   that but
for the risk of detention from sudden frost, they might have still
sailed uninterruptedly to the northward.
     In  his subsequent voyages, the younger        Scoresby   observed the
 disappearance     of the vast accumulations of ice that had for years
 closed the sea    on the west of Greenland; and in 1817, pursuing a
 correspondence     of some years’ standing    with Sir Joseph Banks, he
 informed that eminent person of the remarkable          phenomenon.        In
 the following year the Government,      acting   on this information, and
 the recommendation      of the Council of the Royal Society, despatched
 the <U+FB01>rst   of the expeditions which, within the present century, have
 resolved the important geographical           question of a north-west
 passage.
     The winter   season between his voyages had always been employed
 by Scoresby in the acquisition       of scienti<U+FB01>c    knowledge   :  he had
  studied during two sessions at Edinburgh, where by his assiduity he
  had gained the friendship    of some of the Professors.     In 1820, after
  his seventeenth voyage to the Polar seas, he published,        at the sug
  gestion of Prof. Jameson, his well-known book in two volumes,            An
                                                                         ‘
  Account of the Arctic Regions, with       a  History and Description of
  the Northern Whale Fishery.’        Being the <U+FB01>rst popular work on
  that subject, it was eagerly read, and while it brought fame to the
  author, prepared the way for further developments of whaling enter
  prise, and for arctic research generally.
      Meanwhile Capt. Scoresby was making observations on magnetism,
  a part of science to which, at a later period of his life, he especially

                                     U19
applied, and carrying out measures for preserving the health of his
crews, in which, though he maintained        strict  discipline,  he gained
their esteem.     He owed much of his    success to a   rigid observance of
Sunday,     making it a complete day of rest.       And it is said that in
“his   later voyages he adopted the temperance principle on board his
vessel, <U+FB01>nding that hot coffee was a very much stronger preservative
than spirits against the intense cold of arctic regions.”
    On the death of his second wife in 1822, Capt. Scoresby relin
quished the whale <U+FB01>shery, and thenceforth devoted himself to scienti<U+FB01>c
pursuits   and religious  duties on shore.   He had been for      some time
a Fellow    of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, when in 1824 he was
elected a    Fellow of the Royal Society of London, and subsequently
he was chosen a member of the section Geography            and Navigation,
of the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of France.              Yielding
however to the religious convictions which had always characterized
him, he entered himself     as a student of Queen’s College, Cambridge,
where he took his degree of B.D. in 1834, followed afterwards by
that of D.D. and entrance into Holy Orders.               He o<U+FB01>iciated for
 awhile at the Mariners’ Church, Liverpool, then at Exeter, and at
Bradford in Yorkshire, but eventually resigned the living and retired
to Torquay.
    Here he applied himself anew to the study of magnetic phenomena,
 and published in a collected form, with new facts and observations,
 the various papers which had appeared from his hand            in the Edin
 burgh Philosophical Journal, the Transactions        of the Royal Society
 of Edinburgh, and the Philosophical Transactions.              The import
 ant questions of the effect of the iron of ships upon the compass—
 the effect of concussion and of change     of latitude on the permanent
 magnetism of iron ships——the      capacity and retentiveness of steel in
 different states for the magnetic condition--the nature and phenomena
 of magnetic induction, and other allied questions, are discussed in the
 publication referred to, which appeared at intervals from 1839 to
                                                     ‘
 1852, in three volumes, under the title of Magnetical Investi
 gations.’
    The Reports of the British Association also contain papers by Dr.
 Scoresby on these subjects.     At the meeting of that body at Glasgow
 in 1855, he communicated additional evidence in favour of his views
 and suggestions, particularly on the question of elevating the com

                                        60
pass to a considerable      height above the deck in iron ships.            And a
few months later, with a view to further observation              and experience,
he undertook a      voyage to Australia in the Royal Charter, making
careful and laborious investigations        on the question which he had so
much at heart, both going and returning.               His arrival at Melbourne
was made the occasion of conferring on him the degree of M.A. of
the University of that city.
   Dr. Scoresby came back from Australia in a weakened state of
health, caused by the fatigues of the voyage; nor did his return home
promote recovery.         He grew gradually weaker, and died at Torquay
on the 21st of March, 1857, at the age of sixty-seven, leaving his
third wife    a widow.
   Dr. Scoresby was the author of several works not mentioned above.
Besides a volume of Sermons and books of a religious character, he
published     in 1822, ‘Journal of      :1 Voyage     to the Northern      Whale
Fishery   ;  including Researches and Discoveries on the Eastern Coast
of West Greenland.’ A translation of this book into German appeared
three years later at Hamburg.           In   1851   he brought out a volume,
entitled    ‘Memorials of the Sea,’ being records of his father’s               ad
venturous life, and intended to follow         it by a  similar volume concern
ing his own.       This will probably now appear        as a posthumous     work.
                             ‘
He published also the          Zoistic Magazine,’     with  a view to   elicit the
scienti<U+FB01>c    principles of mesmeric phenomena;            and during the <U+FB01>rst
excitement      respecting    the  lost  arctic    explorers,    he  wrote   ‘
                                                                               The
Franklin Expedition,’ a small book embodying                his views as to the
course and fate      of the party, and the means to           be  taken for their
rescue.
   M. Tniiusnn        was  born on the 4th       of May, 1777, at Nogent sur
Seine, in Champagne.         His father,   a farmer  in humble circumstances,
was a man of strong sense.          He soon discovered the abilities of his
son, and, at a great sacri<U+FB01>ce to himself, procured for him a good ele
mentary education at Sens.          There, young Thénard acquired a taste
for classical literature, which never forsook him. At the age of sixteen
he went to Paris, in order to study pharmacy, with the intention of
returning to practise it in Loutiere. By good fortune he commenced
his chemical studies in the laboratory of Vauquelin, who soon dis
covered the talents of his pupil.          Thénard felt a new life spring up

                                      61
within him in the midst of the intellectual activity of Paris, and the
intention of returning to Champagne           was abandoned.         Thénard’s
ability  as a teacher, and his power     of elucidating science with       a kind
of dramatic effect, suggested, it is  said, by witnessing the performances
of Talma, induced Vauquelin to        obtain for him the appointment            of
Répétiteur    at the E'cole Polytechnique,       where he <U+FB01>rst became ac
quainted with Gay-Lussac.          This happened about the year 1798.
Soon afterwards, Vauquelin deputed him to deliver              some    chemical
lectures for him at the E'cole Polytechnique,        celebrated then, as now,
for the ability of its lecturers.     In this task he was eminently suc
cessful, notwithstanding     the disadvantage       of a strong   Champagne
dialect, which he overcame with difficulty.           About this time, being
twenty years old, his labours,       for which the E'cole Polytechnique
opened a <U+FB01>eld, attracted the attention, and earned the applause of
 Laplace and Berthollet. Thénard’s <U+FB01>rst publication, a memoir on the
 combinations of antimony with oxygen and sulphur, appeared in
 1800.     Guyton de Morveau, one of the Commissioners appointed
 to report upon it to the Institute, declared they recognized in
 M. Thénard, at that time only twenty-three years of            age,  xi  chemist
 practised in the most delicate manipulation,        and possessed    of all the
 means of promoting     the science,  and that he ought to be encouraged
 in a career upon which he had entered with such success.                In 1801
 M. Thénard obtained sebacic acid by submitting to distillation various
 fatty substances.    He discovered     a new method       of making      cerusse,
 which was carried into practice by Roard; also        a blue pigment,     known
 by his name, obtained by igniting hydrate         of alumina with arseniate
 or phosphate of the oxide of cobalt, and a very simple and practical
 method    of purifying oils and rendering them more <U+FB01>t for the pur
 poses of illumination.     This process has been used on an enormous
 scale for more than the third of a century.         He was the <U+FB01>rst chemist
 who devised    a process  for_ estimating   with accuracy the quantity of
 carbonic acid present in atmospheric air, by agitating the air with a
  solution of baryta.   In 1802 Thénard was appointed to <U+FB01>ll the Chair
  of Chemistry at the Collége de France, vacant by the retirement of
  Vauquelin, who recommended Thénard           as  his successor.    About the
  same period he became one       of the ordinary Professors of the E'cole
  Polytechnique, and may        be  considered    to have fairly established
  himself on  a level with the most eminent men of his time.           From the

                                     62
year 1807 he was associated with Gay-Lussac in the production               of
the ‘Recherches     Physico-chimiques,    which have founded their         re
putation in Europe, and have contributed so largely to the progress
of chemical science.      The account of their labours appeared in two
volumes in 1811.       The following are some of the more important
subjects discussed in this work. The discovery          of a purely chemical
process of preparing in considerable quantities the metals of the
alkalies by decomposing potash and soda by contact with iron at a
high temperature, immediately after Davy had obtained them in
minute quantities by the action of a voltaic current; the discovery of
 boron,  of fluoboracic acid, and of hydrofluoric acid; researches on
muriatic acid and oxygenated muriatic acid, since known as hydro
 chloric acid and chlorine;      and lastly,    a discovery      which ranks
among those that have had the greatest influence on the progress
of chemistry, two methods of analysing organic compounds, with
an application of one of these methods to the analysis of fifteen
different   organic  substances.    So highly was this work esteemed,
that in 1810 M. Thénard was unanimously elected Member of the
 Institute in the place of Fourcroy.
    About this time a third Professorship was bestowed upon him, that
 of Chemistry at the Faculté des Sciences de Paris. The discharge of
his new duties was followed by the       same    brilliant  success  that had
attended his lectures at the Ecole Polytechnique          and the Collége de
 France.    The three Professorships which he held at the same time,
 and the duties     of which he discharged without apparent effort,
seemed    hardly sufficient to satisfy the extraordinary activity of his
mind.     The attractive richness of his teaching, combined with his
beautiful discoveries, spread his reputation over the whole scientific
world.     It became requisite to   build larger lecture-rooms for him,
 and during    twenty years he lectured to       a  class   of more than a
 thousand hearers.      In 1812 appeared his “Traité Elémentaire de
 Chimie Théorique     et  Pratique.   It went through six editions, and
made the fortune of the publisher.         This treatise, equally remark
able for lucidity of exposition and         completeness      of matter, was
translated into many different languages, promoted a knowledge              of
chemistry, and rendered the name of Thénard popular in every country
                                           -
into which science has penetrated.
   The most remarkable of his discoveries      was that    of the peroxide  of

                                         as
  hydrogen     in 1818.    This was followed by the discovery of the per
  oxides of calcium and strontium.         M. Pelouze, in his address to the
  Academy on the occasion of the death of Thénard, from which, and
  that of M. Ch. Giraud, the greater part of this notice is taken,
  observes that no person has so largely contributed              to spread a taste
  for chemistry by his books and lectures, and especially through the
  medium of his numerous pupils, as Thénard.                     In 1827 he was
  elected a Member of the Chamber of Deputies, in which he joined
  the liberal and moderate party.
     After the Revolution of 1830, he became          a Member of the Council
  of Public Instruction, and soon afterwards, in company with Gay
  Lussac, was called to the Chamber of Peers.                  In the capacity of
  Administrator      of the College    de  France,    and of the Faculté des
  Sciences,    as Member,     and   afterwards   Vice-President, for       a great
  number    of years, of the Conseil supérieur      de   l’Instruction publique,
  he contributed, more than any person since Cuvier, to the develop
. ment and progress of the principal scienti<U+FB01>c institutions of France.
     He was three times President of the Jury of the Exposition; he
  took an active part in the administration of railroads, and was Pre
  sident of the Société d’Encouragement after the death of Chaptal in
   1832.
     To the end of his life he took     an active share      in the labours of the
  Academy.       He was elected   a  Foreign Member of the Royal Society
             ’
  in 1824.
     He married the daughter of M. Humblot Conté. She was the
  granddaughter of Conté, .Member of the Institute of Egypt.                   Her
  death, after a union of forty years, was soon followed by that of one
  of his sons.
     During the last years of his laborious life, he published some in
  teresting researches on the waters of Mont Dore, and, conjointly with
  his son, M. Paul Thénard, commenced researches on decompositions
  by contact, the <U+FB01>rst part of which has been read before the Academy.
  A few months before his death, he undertook the formation of a
  charitable   institution, called “ La Société     de Secours des       Amis   des
  Sciences.”    M. Thénard came from his       estate   of La Ferte-sur-Crosne,
  near Chalon-sur-Saone,       to his house in the Place Saint~Sulpice in
  Paris, in order to undergo a slight surgical operation, the removal of
  an encysted tumour. The operation was successfully performed by

                                              64
  M. Velpeau.      The wound healed rapidly, and there                       seemed      no doubt
  of a complete cure, when he             was attacked           by a catarrhal affection,
  which, during the last <U+FB01>fteen years             of his life, had often obliged him
  to keep his bed. On Thursday, the 18th of June, 1857, the mildness
  of the air tempted him to drive in the Bois de Boulogne.                                  On re

I. “ On the Chemical Action of Water on Soluble Salts.” By
        Dr. J. H. GLADSTONE, F.R.S. Received November 19,1857.
   Before extending      my researches on chemical     a<U+FB01>inity among sub
stances   in solution, it seemed  desirable to ascertain, if  possible, what
speci<U+FB01>c chemical action water exerts on a salt.       This inquiry is beset
with unusual di<U+FB01>iculties, and unfortunately my experiments have not
led to any conclusive result.        Yet some of the observations made
during the course of the inquiry have a value independent of theory,
and a brief notice of them may not perhaps be deemed unworthy of
a place in the Proceedings of the Royal Society.
    It is well known that many anhydrous      salts will absorb water, and
still remain solid bodies, either amorphous      or crystallized.     In such
a case the water combined       is always in simple atomic relation      with
the salt itself;   great heat is often evolved, and a change of colour
frequently    ensues.    These   “ hydrated” salts
                                                     (as they     are  usually
considered)    are  generally soluble in water; and it is the condition
 of such   a body when dissolved that opens    awide <U+FB01>eld for speculation.
The water may act merely as a        solvent; or it may unite without de
 composition with the dissolved salt, becoming an integral part of the
 compound in solution; or reciprocal decomposition may ensue, each
electro-positive    element combining    with each electro-negative one in
certain proportions; or the ultimate result may be due to two or more
of these modes of action in conjunction.
    When a “hydrated” salt is dissolved in          a minimum        of water,

                                       67
nothing is usually       observed beyond      the    new physical      properties
resulting from the change in its state of aggregation and the absorp
tion of beat.     No change of colour,     as  far  as I  can <U+FB01>nd, ever ensues,
though a change in the amount of <U+FB02>uorescence may occur.                     When
an anhydrous salt, which will not combine with water to form a
solid compound, dissolves, a change         of colour   does sometimes ensue.
Sometimes, however, an evident decomposition                takes place, the hy
drogen and oxygen         of the water combining each with            one  of the
elements    of the other binary compound, and the products of this
action remaining uncombined.           Chloride of bismuth and citrate of
ammonia     are instances.      Butvin the vast majority of instances,’ the
salt MR    and the water      HO   do not suffer reciprocal       decomposition,
unless indeed, as has been contended, the resulting            MO, HR remain
combined together in solution.
   If  a reciprocal   decomposition     of this character actually occurs, it
may be anticipated by analogy, that by increasing the amount              of HO,
more   MR will    be decomposed.        Now,    if additional    water he added
to saturated aqueous solutions        of pentachloride       of antimony, ferric
sulphate, ammoniacal nitrate of copper, or nitrate of bismuth, decom
position   results, and a precipitate forms proportional           within certain
limits to the amount of water added; but not               one  of these is a salt
of the simplest constitution.        Sometimes, however, a change is ren
dered apparent      in simple salts by     a change      of colour without the
formation    of a precipitate.
   This was closely examined.         It might be expected, ti priori, that
a  certain amount of salt would have the same absorbent effect on a
given quantity     of light, whether it were dissolved in much or little
water, and that as the absorbent power of water is practically nil, it
would appear to the        eye  of precisely the same depth and character
of colour in the two        cases.   And this actually holds good in the
majority of instances; but to prove it a special contrivance was
necessary, in order to make the same quantity of light impinge upon
the solution before and after dilution.          This was effected by means
of colourless cylindrical glasses of uniform diameter and the same
size, closed at one end with a <U+FB01>at plate of glass, so that when placed
upright they could hold liquids : they stood in a case so contrived
that all the light which passed through the strong or diluted solu
tion, as looked through from above, had to enter by the <U+FB02>at plate
                                                                   I2

                                             68
 at the bottom.         Every experiment was performed               by a comparative
 method, two glasses being placed side by side, one containing the
 solution to     be diluted,   the other a similar quantity          of the same solu
 tion which served as a standard.
     In this manner it       was determined      that the following salts absorbed
 the same light whether dissolved in much or in little water                    :
          Ferrous Sulphate.                          Terchloride of Gold.
          Ferric Nitrate.                            Terbromide of Gold.
          Ferric Meconate.                           Protochloride of Platinum
          Ferric Comeuate.                              (in hydrochloric acid).
          Ferric Comenamate.                         Bichloride of Platinum.
          Ferric Gallate.                            Bichloride of Palladium.
          Nitrate of Nickel.                         Chromate of Potash.
          Nitrate of Cobalt.                         Ferrocyanide of Potassium.
          Sulphate of Cobalt.                        Ferridcyanide of Potassium.
          Chloride of Chromium.                      Nitroprusside of Sodium.
          Acetate of Chromium.                       Sulphindigotic acid.
          Chromate of Chromium.                      Sulphindigotste of Ammonia.
          Nitrate of Uranium.                        Carbazotate of Copper.
          Chloride of Uranium.                       Peutasulphide of Potassium.
          Sulphate of Ceric Oxide.
     The following salts were affected in regard to their absorption of
 light, by adding water to their saturated solutions :—
                 Salt.                Saturated solution.         Dilute solution.
    Ferric Acetate.                iRed.                    Darker.
   Ferric Tartrate.                 Red.                    Slightly paler.
   Ferric Chloride.                :Orange-red.             Orange-yellow.
   Ferric Citrate.                 IRed.                    Orange and paler.           I
   Ferric Sulphocyanide.           ‘Intense red.            Orange.
   Chloride of Nickel.            ;Yellowish green.         Bluish green.
   Iodide of Nickel.              IDeep green.              Paler blue-green.
   Chloride of Cobalt.            ‘Red.                     Paler and less pure.
   Iodide of Cobalt.              Deep green.               Pale red.
   Acetate of Cobalt.              Red.                     Paler and more orange.
   Sulphocyanide of Cobalt.       .Intense purple.          Pale red.
   Chloride of Copper.            IGreen.                   Blue.
   Bromide of Copper.              Green.                   Blue.
   Acetate of Copper.              Greenish blue.           Paler and purer blue.
   Permanganate of Potash.        lPurple.                  Paler and redder.
   Chromic acid.                    Red.                    Orange.
     That these changes of colour are due to the action of the water,
and not to any merely physical cause, is proved by the fact                         that
alcohol does not occasion them.                   Quantitative      experiments     were
instituted with acetate of copper and sulphocyanide                   of iron, to deter
mine whether the effect of successive additions                     of water is in      a
decreasing      ratio.    It  was    found    to be so on the whole,             but the

                                                69
results showed certain irregularities                  that do not usually       occur in
cases     of reciprocal        decomposition,        where the mass       of   one   of the
compounds is successively increased.
     A   prismatic       examination     of the rays absorbed by these salts in
different states          of solution revealed two very suggestive facts.              The
one      is,   that in every        ferric acetate) the salt in dilute
                                 case (except
solution not only transmits every ray that was transmitted by       in                it
saturated solution, but also some rays which     then absorbed.it The
other      that strong solutions of the chlorides, bromides, and iodides
           is,
of    copper, cobalt, nickel, and iron—analogous metals-exhibit not
only the absorption due to the respective bases, but another absorp
tion which can be identi<U+FB01>ed with that produced by the halogens
themselves when simply dissolved in water                  ;   while, when these solu
tions are diluted, they cease to produce                  this second absorption, and
give precisely        the same prismatic             image as any compound           of the
same base         with   a   colourless acid.        The amount of water required to
effect this change depends on the temperature.                      That the phenomena
indicate some  difference of arrangement among the elements of the
dissolved salt and the water, cannot,   think, be doubted, but they
                                                     I
fail to show in any distinct manner what that difference is.
     The action of water on double salts                  is   a   still more complicated
                                                          the two
problem; but the question as~to whether water separates
components did not prove so di<U+FB02>icult of decision. While on the one
hand the physical properties of many double salts, as for instance
the potassio-chloride                       prove that they are not
                                 or iodide of platinum,
                                                         other hand,
decomposed by water, the experiments of Graham, on the
show that some salts, as for instance alum, su<U+FB01>'er at least   partial            a
decomposition            in diffusion.
   The iodide of mercury and potassium, and the sulphocyanide of
silver and potassium, dissolve in small quantity of water, but the

addition of more             causes    of the insoluble component.

                                                           and the
potassium, the iodides of platinum or gold with potassium,
hydrochlorate of chloride of gold, do not change in colour on the
dilution of their aqueous solutions; but this does not prove that no
separation has taken place, for the colour of these double
                                                             salts in
solution   precisely that of an equivalent amount of that component
                 is

                                    70
to which the colour is due.      But bichlorate of potash and bicome
namate of iron likewise exhibit no change of colour on dilution,
though   such must ensue,    if they be converted into neutral salt and
free acid.   On the other hand, the red potassio-oxalate of chromium
varies in intensity of colour on the addition of water, and the different
double chlorides of copper undergo the same change as the simple
salt.   If hydrochlorate  of terchloride of gold be added to the terbro
mide of that    metal,  a reduction in colour ensues, and an analogous
result is obtained when the double sulphate of copper and potash
acts on the acetate of copper—facts which point to a decomposition
of the double salt in solution. Indeed it is evident that some double
salts are resolved more or less into their components by water, while
others are not so affected.
   The general tendency of my observations has led me to the opinion,
that water does not act upon a salt dissolved in    it in a manner analo
gous to that of the hydracids, but     I hesitate to draw any conclusion
as to the rational constitution of a dissolved salt.

       GoRE,    Esq.     Communicated by Dr. TYNDALL, F.R.S.

                                 (Abstract.)
   Antimony may be readily deposited by the electro-process from
either of the following liquids:–5 parts of tartar-emetic and 5 parts
of tartaric acid dissolved in a mixture of 2 parts of hydrochloric acid
and 30 parts of water; or 3 or 4 parts of tartar-emetic dissolved
in 1 part of the ordinary chloride of antimony.
    The metallic deposits obtained from these two liquids differ greatly
in appearance, in structure, and in physical properties: that obtained
from the first liquid has a silver-grey colour and frosted surface, is
hard in texture, and has a beautiful radiating crystalline structure;
whilst that obtained from the second liquid has the colour and ap
pearance    of highly polished steel, and has a bright metallic amor
phous fracture.      The specific gravity of the former is 6:55, whilst
 that of the latter is 5'78, both being somewhat variable in this
respect.    The electro-chemical    equivalent of the crystalline variety,

after deducting a small portion          of gas contained in          it,   is   about 40'2    ;
and   of the amorphous kind, after deducting  much larger per-cent

age   of gas and of chloride of antimony, which   always contains,   it
the same;       but the equivalents actually           obtained,          including those
substances, were 40"/‘ for the crystalline and              433 for the amorphous
variety.  Amorphous antimony was found to be electro-positive to
the crystalline kind, both in acids and alkalies was also thermo ;   it
electro-positive     to that substance;         and both reduced silver by im
mersion in     a   solution of nitrate   of silver.
   Both these substances when deposited           in unequal
                                                           are                        states   of
cohesive tension at their two surfaces, frequently in so great                        a   degree
as to   rentthe metal in all directions.           But the most remarkable cir
cumstance, and of which        a    brief account     was published              in the Philo
sophical     Magazine,     January 1855, is, that amorphous antimony                           is
liable, by percussion or heat, to undergo              a    rapid     and intense mole
cular change throughout its mass, consisting apparently of violent                   a
commotion amongst its particles, similar, but in   much higher de    a
gree, to the changes already observed by other experimentalists                                in
sulphur, selenium, iodide of mercury, &c., and attended by evolution
of an extraordinary amount of heat, su<U+FB02>icient, when the substance                              is
massive, to raise its temperature from 60° to upwards of -150° Fahr.,
melting in several instances bars of tin and other metals.
   During the action the chloride of antimony and                         a   portion     of the    _
gas are expelled by the heat, and the substance loses its remarkable
property. After the action the antimony               is   found to have undergone
no oxidation, but to have considerably altered in its physical charac
ters;   it   has lost its steel-bright    colour and become comparatively
grey,    and has acquired       a   dull grey granular fracture; its speci<U+FB01>c
gravity has also increased, and          it   has evidently passed            a    considerable
stage towards the condition           of the other variety.                 The grey metal
undergoes no such change.
   By careful trituration of thin pieces of the amorphous metal under
cold water,     has been obtained in the state of <U+FB01>ne powder posr
                it                                                    a
sessing the same         molecular     property.       The chloride                of antimony
adheres to the metal with considerable                  force, and            is   only partly

       fessor ALBERT KöLLIKER, of Würzburg.      Communicated
       by Sir B. C. BRoDIE, Bart.   Received December 1, 1857.
     During my stay in England, in the autumn of 1857,                                    I was   so
fortunate as to acquire the rare poison of the famous                              Antiaris toxi
caria (Lesch.), with which no experiments have been tried since the
time of Magendie, Brodie, Horsfield, and Schnell and Emmert (1809–
1815).       I owe my specimens of the Antiar                   Prof.
                                                                    poison to my friend
Christison, of Edinburgh, who had it from Borneo, and to Dr. Hors
field, of London, who collected it himself during his stay at Java in
the beginning of this century; and as both specimens were fully
active—as some preliminary                    experiments made in company with my
friends      Dr.          Sharpey and Dr. Allen Thomson showed—I thought
it well worth while to devote some time to the study of the poison,
and to try to elucidate               its   manner    of   action    on   the animal organism.
The following are the principal results which                       I     obtained   in   my expe
riments with frogs, and              I hope that they will not             be   deemed   unworthy
of of             in by
        notice            those who    take     an   interest   in   the physiological      action
        poisons           general.

                                                    73
  The Antiar, like most other poisons, acts from the intestinal canal,
and from wounds; but it must be remarked, that it is much more ener
getic and rapid when introduced into                      a wound.     The symptoms which
are observed in frogs, in the latter case,                      are the following:—First of
all, the voluntary movements become less energetic, and at length
cease totally, 30 to 40 minutes after the introduction of the poison
(after 21" min. and               1h   21" max.).          Then follows         a time       in which
reflex movements may be caused by stimulating the skin; but this
faculty also is lost very soon, viz. at from 50 to 60 minutes (at 33"
min. and 85" max.); and the animals die without the slightest
trace     of convulsions or tetanic spasm.                     If now      the frogs are opened,
we find that, without any exception, the heart has ceased to beat.
The auricles are dilated, the ventricle corrugated, rather small, and
generally red, as            if   blood had been extravasated into                     its   muscular
parietes; but very soon the exposure                           of   the heart    to   the air causes
the ventricle         to   shrink little more, and
                                     a                become pale and stiff,
                                                                 to                                     as
if   in   the state        of rigor mortis. All interior organs, especially the
lungs, liver, stomach, intestine, and kidneys, are gorged with blood,
and     in   a    state    of   great, especially venous, hyperaemia.                      The blood
is fluid and rather dark, but soon coagulates when exposed      the                               to
air, and assumes    brighter colour. The lymphatic hearts cease
                            a                                                                           to
beat as soon as the reflex movements are lost.                                 At     the same time
the nerves are yet found excitable, but their power                             is    very low, and
generally vanishes              in   the second hour after the application                        of   the
poison.           The same must              be   said   of    the muscles, which contract
very feebly when     directly stimulated     galvanism, and     by
                                                                most                          in
cases lose their power totally    the second    third hour, and gene
                                               in                     or
rally    little after their nerves.
          a                            The rigor mortis begins early,
sometimes          in     the sixth hour, and             is   generally well established               at
the eighteenth hour.
     Amongst         all   these symptoms,          to   which we may add some signs                    of
vomiting occurring                now and then, there was none which attracted
my attention more than the cessation                       of   the movements          of   the heart,
considering        the great energy which                  this organ possesses              in   frogs;
and  I       tried, therefore, before all,                to   elucidate the action               of   the
Antiar upon the heart.                        For this purpose             I   instituted     a        new
series       of   experiments,         in   which   I    exposed the heart            by   the section
of   the sternum, before the poison was introduced into                                 a    wound      of

                                                             74
the back; and in this way                             I    easily got the result, that the heart
ceases to beat as soon                      as from the           fifth to the tenth minute after
the introduction                of the Antiar; and                   so,   that first the ventricle stops,
and      half       a minute or one minute later, also the auricles.                              Now, as
the frogs at this time are not at                                    all   deprived                their faculty                     to
move, we may have the rather astonishing view                                              of of     an   animal, with
artificially-paralysed                 heart, which moves and leaps                                   as    freely            as    if
nothing had happened.
  The experiments just mentioned prove, that the first action the                                                           of
Upas Antiar      paralyse the heart; and am therefore quite
                          is    to                                                I                                                 in
accordance with Sir Benjamin Brodie, who,     his experiments                         by                                             on
mammalia, came    the same result 1812;
                                 to      whilst cannot otherwise
                                                                de in
                                                                                           I
than disagree with Schnell (Diss.                                       Upas Antiar, Tubingae, 1815),
who assumes that this poison acts                                    in    the first place                on   the spinal
marrow.              Now this point fixed, the further question arises, whether
the other symptoms mentioned, viz. the paralysis                                                of      the voluntary
and reflex movements, and the loss                                              the irritability                             mus
                                                                        of of                             of of
                                                                                                                  the
cles and nerves, are only the results                                           the paralysis                  the heart,
or   must           be   attributed
                                            to
                                            a         specific action              of   the Antiar.                  For the
elucidation              of    this question,        I      found       it      necessary       to   study the                 con
sequences            of     the suppression                of   the heart's action                 on     the organism
of   frogs, which           I    did       in   the same way               asit   had been done                   by   others,
                    by by
especially                 Kunde (Müller's Archiv, 1847); viz.                                  by   cutting out the
                                                                                        of
heart,         or         putting ligature around the base
                                      a                                                 it,        so     as   to   stop the
circulation              totally.      The results              of   these experiments were                           in      both
cases the same,              that       say, the voluntary movements ceased
                                           is   to                                                                                   in
from 30          to      60 minutes, and the reflex movements after one     two                                         or
hours.          Hence          it    follows that these two symptoms                             of     the poisoning
with Antiar are simply dependent      the paralysis             on
                                                     the heart caused                       of
 on by
       With reference
         it.              the irritability    the muscles and nerves,
                                                to                              of
                                                                                                                            in of
         the contrary,          it    is   easy      to   show that the ligature                or   excision                       the
                                                                as   the Antiar; inasmuch
                                                                                                                    or as
heart has not the same influence                                                                                                    the
first      case      the muscles and nerves are found irritable six                                                          seven
hours, and more, after the experiment has been made.                                                       Therefore                 it
may        be   said that the Antiar has                     a   direct action             on   these organs.
     These points once demonstrated, there remained one more question
to       elucidate, namely, whether                         the Antiar acts only upon the                                     mus
cles,      or also upon the nerves.                         If    we consider that the                         Antiar               un

                                          75
doubtedly paralyses the muscles, we may easily see that the loss              of the
excitability of‘ the nerves possibly depends merely upon the impair
ment of the muscular contractility, and is therefore not real, but only
apparent.        With    a view to determine      the real state      of things,   I
tried   a   third    series   of experiments—poisoning          frogs   in such     a
manner that the muscles of one limb were kept free from the in<U+FB02>u
ence   of the poison.         This was done in two ways: <U+FB01>rst, by putting
a ligature round the crural artery and vein of one leg; and secondly,
by cutting through a leg entirely, after the ligature of its vessels, with
the exception only        of the ischiadic nerve. In poisoning frogs treated
in  one  of   these ways, through a wound of the back, I found that, with
the exception of the heart, the Antiar acts in the <U+FB01>rst instance upon
the muscles.        This is shown by the fact, that in the second hour, at
the time when the muscles of the poisoned                 parts have lost their
irritability,    the    nerves  of the sacral plexus in the abdomen still
possess      their full in<U+FB02>uence upon the muscles of the leg which has
been kept free from the action of the poison.                  One might be in
clined     from this to conclude, that the nerves are not at all acted
upon by the       Antiar; but this inference would be erroneous.            In  fact,
the experiments just          mentioned,    if followed    a  little longer, show
that in the third or fourth hour the               sacral  plexus    also becomes
inactive,     at a time when the muscles          of the non-poisoned leg are
fully contractile.        The Antiar, therefore, paralyses also the nervous
trunks, but later than the muscles.
    From all these experiments, it seems           to follow that the Antiar is
a poison which acts principally upon                the muscular      system (the
heart and the voluntary muscles), a conclusion,              in favour of which
I   may further add, that the muscles and the heart of frogs poisoned by
 Urari (Woorara, Curare) lose their irritability totally, and in             a short
 time,   if Antiar    is introduced   into a wound some time after the        Urari.
If   we consider that, as      I  have shown (see Proceedings         of the Royal
Society, 1856, p. 201), the Urari only acts upon the terminations of
 the nerves in the muscles, and does not affect the irritability of the
 heart    and muscles at all, we may conclude, that a poison, which,
 as the    Antiar, is capable of paralysing the muscles after the Urari,
has really a direct action upon the muscular <U+FB01>bre.
     The results of my investigation into the effects of the Antiar upon
  frogs, are therefore the following       :—

                                          76
    l. The Antiar      is a paralysing   poison.
   2.   It  acts in the <U+FB01>rst     instance and with great rapidity          (in 5  to
10 minutes) upon the heart, and stops its action.
   3. The consequences        of this paralysis of the heart         are the cessa
tion of the voluntary       and re<U+FB02>ex movements in the <U+FB01>rst and second
hour after the introduction        of the poison.
   4. The      Antiar     paralyses in     the   second place       the  voluntary
muscles.
   5.   In the third place it     causes the loss    of excitability of the great
nervous trunks.
    6. The heart and muscles          of frogs poisoned with Urari may be
paralysed by Antiar.
    7.  From all this it may       be deduced,     that the Antiar principally
acts upon the muscular <U+FB01>bre and causes paralysis              of it.
   So much for this time.           My experiments with the Antiar upon
warm-blooded        animals have only begun, and          I am not yet able to
draw any conclusion from them.              As soon   as this  will  be possible,   I
shall take the liberty to submit them to the Royal Society, together
with the results of my experiments with the Upas tieuté, which
poison    I had also the good fortune to obtain through the kindness               of
Sir Benjamin Brodie and Dr. Hors<U+FB01>eld. With regard to the Antiar
I may further add, that experiments made independently, and at
the same time, by my friend Dr. Sharpey with this poison, have con
ducted to the same results as my own.
II.    “On    some Physical Properties         of Ice.” By Joan TYNDALL,
             Ph.D., F.R.S.         Received December 17, 1857.
                                    (Abstract.)
   In this    paper the following points are considered        :
    1.  The   effects  of radiant heat upon ice.
    2.  The   effects  of conducted heat upon ice.
    3. The air- and water-cavities        of ice.
   4. The effects      of pressure upon ice.
    For the experiments on radiant heat, slabs of Wcnham Lake and
 Norway ice were made          use of.    Through these       a solar beam, con

                                        77
densed by a double convex lens, was transmitted.                     At   the moment
the beam crossed the transparent solid, the track of the beam became
instantly starred by little lustrous spots, like shining                  air-bubbles.
Round     each   of   these a figure, shaped like a flower      of six petals, was
formed.   The petals were manifestly liquid water. When the beam
was permitted to traverse different portions of the ice in succession,
the sudden appearance of the stars, and the formation and growth of
the flowers around them, could be distinctly observed through an
ordinary pocket lens.
  To test whether the brilliant spots at the centres of the flowers
contained air or not, portions of ice containing        them were gradually
melted in warm water.           The moment    a   liquid connexion was esta
blished between the cavities and the atmosphere, the bubbles                       col
lapsed, and no trace of air rose to the surface of the water. The
formation of each  liquid  flower is therefore accompanied by the
formation of a vacuum at its centre.
  The perfect symmetry of these flowers at once enables                    us to infer
that ice is a uniaxal crystal, the line perpendicular            to the planes in
which the flowers are produced being the optic axis.
  For a long time during the investigation it was found that the
flowers were formed in planes parallel to those        of freezing; but           some
apparent exceptions to this rule were afterwards noticed, which                    are
described in the paper.
  In    some masses      of ice, apparently homogeneous, the flowers were
formed on the track        of the beam, in planes which were in            some cases
a quarterof an inch apart. This proves that the interior portions
of a mass of ice may be melted by radiant heat which has traversed
other portions of the mass without melting them.
   In                  of the paper the author describes the gradual
        a second section
liquefaction of masses of ice by the formation of drops of water within
them; and he infers from his observations that the melting-point of
ice oscillates within small limits on each side of the ordinary standard.
Through weakness of crystalline texture, or some other cause, some
portions of a mass of ice melt at a temperature slightly under 32°
Fahr., while others of stronger texture require a temperature slightly
                                                      of is,
over 32° to liquefy them.     The consequence       that such    mass,        a
raised   the temperature 32°, will have some
          to                                                   its
                                                      parts liquid and
some solid.

                                                                     78
   In   a   third section the air- and water-cavities observed in ice are
examined.             These            the author                observed in lake ice, and they are
manifestly the same as those described by                                            M.        Agassiz, the Messrs.
Schlagintweit,            and        Mr. Huxley, as occurring in the ice of glaciers.
The hypothesis of M. Agassiz and the Messrs. Schlagintweit                                                             is,   that
the air-bubble             absorbs the heat which                               the ice,        as   a   diathermanous
body, has permitted                         to   pass, the solid surrounding                          the bubble being
liquefied by the heat thus absorbed. Mr. Huxley makes the suppo
sition most     accordance with the facts known
                     in                          the time of his                                  at
observations, namely, that the water                                          in   the cavity has never been
frozen.        It    is   shown
                                            by    the author that the water-cavities examined
by him have           been produced
                                                          by     the melting            of   the ice.
   But      the hypothesis                   of    M.      Agassiz and the Messrs. Schlagintweit,
which appears              to       have received general acceptance, leads                                       to   the   fol
lowing consequences:—Taking                                      the specific heat               of    water and        of      air
into account, the author shows that                                       a   bubble      of   air,    in   order      to   raise
its                           of                                temperature, must lose 3080°.
                                                        of in
      own volume                     water         1°
   Taking the latent heat                                       water into account, the author shows
                           or its
that,   to     melt                 own volume                  of   ice,     an   air-bubble            must part with
3080x142.6,                         439,208°            of      temperature.              Now M. Agassiz states,
that when        a    piece          of     ice containing bubbles                        is   exposed        to the sun,
the water formed soon exceeds the air                                              in   volume.             Hence,    his
                                                                                                                       if
hypothesis           be
               correct, the quantity     heat absorbed     the air         of                               by                   in
                     observation, would,

traversed our atmosphere and been sifted                                                by    it,
                                                                                             is        absolutely           inap
preciable.           This conclusion                      becomes             stronger when the absorption
 by            ice   in                                      us                      to   the absorption

   Regarding              heat
                                       as
                                       a         mode           of   motion, the author shows that the
liberty     of   liquidity            is    attained             by   the molecules             at     the surface           of  a
mass of ice before the molecules                                     at   the centre         of the      mass can attain
this liberty.                                                                                                                    its
                                                                                                                        at in
              Within the mass each molecule                                                     is     controlled
motion by the surrounding molecules. But                                                if    a   cavity exist                  the
interior,      the molecules surrounding                                    that cavity are              in   a   condition

                                                    79
similar to those at the surface                ;   and they are liberated by an amount
of motion which has               been transmitted             through the    ice   without pre
judice to its solidity. The conception is helped when we call to
 mind the transmission of motion through a series of elastic balls, by
which the last ball of the                series is detached, while the others do not
suffer visible separation.
  The author proves, by actual experiment, that the interior portions
of a mass of ice may be lique<U+FB01>ed by an amount of heat which has
been       conducted        through the              exterior    portions     without melting
them.
  The converse of this takes place when two pieces of ice at 32°
Fahr., with moist surfaces, are brought into contact. Super<U+FB01>cial
portions      areby this act virtually transferred to the centre ; and
as    equilibrium soon sets in between the motion of the tenuous <U+FB01>lm
of moisture between the pieces of ice and the solid on                              each side   of
it,   the consequence        is   shown to be that the <U+FB01>lm freezes, and cements
the two pieces of ice together.                      The fourth section of the paper            is
devoted to these considerations.
      In   the <U+FB01>fth section       a   series       of observations bearing upon the con
ductivity of ice for heat             is   recorded.
      In   the sixth section the in<U+FB02>uence of pressure upon ice                      is   examined.
A     cylinder of the substance was placed between two slabs of box
 wood, and subjected to               a   gradually-increasing         pressure.         Looked at
 perpendicular        to the axis, cloudy lines were observed drawing them
 selves     across the cylinder.               Looked         at obliquely,    these lines were
 found to be the sections of dim surfaces which traversed the cylin
 der, and gave       it   the appearance of              a   crystal of gypsum whose planes
 of   cleavage      had been forced out of optical contact by some external
 force.
      The surfaces     are not        of plates of air, for they        are formed when the
 compressed ice        is   kept under water.       They also commence sometimes
 in the centre of the          mass,       and spread gradually on all sides till they
 <U+FB01>nally embrace the entire transverse section of the cylinder.                                    A
 concave mirror was so disposed that the diffuse light of day                                  was
 thrown upon the cylinder while under pressure. The hazy surfaces
 produced by the compression of the mass were observed to be in                                   a
 state of intense commotion, which followed closely upon the edge of
                                                                                                      1"

                                   80
the surface as it advanced through the solid.       It  is <U+FB01>nally shown
that these surfaces are due to the liquefaction     of the ice in planes
perpendicular  to the pressure.
   The surfaces were always formed with great facility parallel to
those planes in which the liquid <U+FB02>owers already described are pro
duced by radiant heat, while it is exceedingly difficult to obtain them
perpendicular   to these planes.    Thus, whether    we   apply heat or
pressure, the experiments   show that ice melts with peculiar facility
in certain directions.

        16, 1857.
    In the spring of 1857, Her.Majesty’s         Government,       designing  to
 send an expedition to examine and survey the yet unsettled country
 north of the boundary-line between the British territory and that of
 the United States, and comprised between Canada on the east and
 the Rocky Mountains on the west, noti<U+FB01>ed               their intention   to the
 Royal Society, and invited suggestions regarding any objects of
 physical research, for which the Royal Society might deem this to be
 a <U+FB01>tting occasion.

Observations,    and to assist generallyin Geographical Determinations,
the Royal Society undertook        to provide the instruments       suitable for
the purpose,    and with the sanction       of the Committee of the Kew
Observatory     of the British     Association,   placed     their preparation
under the superintendence        of Mr. Welsh, Director of that Observa
tory, where also Lieut. Blakiston received instructions for their           use,
and acquired practical experience in their manipulation.             About the

                       Prince of Wales          for  York Fort, where he arrived
on the 16th of August, and after completing                the Magnetic Observa
tions which he had been charged to make at that station, proceeded
on the 30th      of the   same   month,     by the canoe route, to join         Mr.
Palliser, who had quitted England some days before him, and had
taken the route by the United States to Canada and the Red River
Settlement,      and thence to Carlton House, where the whole party
would be assembled in the fall.
    The care which Lieut. Blakiston bestowed upon his determinations
at York Fort appears to have been commensurate with the theoreti
cal importance which, before he quitted England, he was aware would
attach to the results.        In submitting these to the Society, I must
solicit a  continuance of the patience and indulgence so kindly given
to me on a recent occasion        ;  for the subject of Terrestrial Magnetism
is far less     generally   understood      than     I believe it deserves   to be;
and there is often an apparent           complexity      in the details, especially
to those who are       not familiar with the subject, which requires time
to be occupied in their elucidation.             I  shall commence with showing
the con<U+FB01>rmation         which   Lieut. Blakiston’s results give to the ap
proximate accuracy of the value assigned in the ‘Philosophical Trans
actions’ for 1846, for the absolute magnetic force at its principal
 point of maximum in the northern hemisphere.
    Those who are conversant, either from personal recollection                or as
 a matter    of history, with the opinions regarding the phenomena of
 terrestrial   magnetism entertained          in the <U+FB01>rst quarter of the present
 century,    will scarcely  need    to be reminded how generally the belief
then prevailed, that the magnetic dip and the intensity                of the mag
 netic force at different points of the earth’s surface might be repre
 sented with at least a sufficient approximation              by mathematical    for
mulae,   obtained by supposing the magnetism                of the earth to be con
 centrated    into two magnetic poles, very near to each other and to
 the earth’s centre;      the supposition       being also equivalent to that       of
 an in<U+FB01>nite     number of small magnets parallel             to each other, distri
 buted    equally   throughout the earth’s surface.              According to this
 supposition, the greatest intensity of the magnetic force in each of
 the two hemispheres        should    be found       at the points where the dip
 should be 90°, and the intensity should vary in the proportion             of  2 :  1
between places where the dip should be respectively                90° and 0°.

    In the Arctic Expeditions of 1818, 1819, and 1820,           I had an op
portunity of measuring the intensity of the magnetic force at several
stations in the immediate vicinity of the dip of 90° ; and in the years
 1821 and 1822,      of comparing    these   measures with others made at
several points of the coasts of Europe, Africa, and America, and at
islands in the Atlantic Ocean (which I visited for the purpose of
making observations with the pendulum), in dips which, including the
Arctic stations, varied from 0° to 88° 47'.        The result of this compa
rison was to place beyond a question the irreconcilability of the phe
nomena with the supposition of a coincidence between the points of
90° of dip and of the maximum            of force.   For example, the mag
netic force was found to be considerably greater at New York, where
the dip was not more than 73°, than at the stations in the Polar Sea
where    it was nearly 90°; and by graphical delineations, according to
well-known     methods, in which all the observations were taken into
the account, it was shown that whilst the dip of 90° could not be in
a more southerly       latitude  than   70°,   the greatest intensity of the
force would      be  found    somewhere about the 53rd parallel in the
vicinity of Hudson’s Bay, not          less  than   1000 geographical    miles
distant from the point of 90° of dip with which        it had   been supposed
to coincide.
    The hypothesis,     so generally  put forward in the elementary trea
 tises on Magnetism       of that period, was therefore shown to be no
 longer tenable.     It  was in fact specially one of that class of specula
tions designated by Bacon as          “anticipations of nature,” of which
it is  so commonly the fate to be swept away, as knowledge advances
by that more slow and gradual, but more philosophical and certain
 “interpretation of nature,” which results from a strictly inductive
 process.
     Steadily pursuing this last-named process, the Royal Society—after
 provision had been made by the establishment          of Colonial Magnetic
 Observatories for a systematic examination of the phenomena of the
 variations of comparatively small amount, which are produced at the
 surface   of our planet by the in<U+FB02>uence of other bodies of our system;
 and by the Antarctic Expedition of Sir James Ross, for the magnetic
 survey of such portions of the higher latitudes of the southern hemi
 sphere as are accessible to navigation,—recommended         to  HerMajesty’s

     York Fort had been                        one     of   the stations visited                 by   Lieut. (now
Lieut.-Col.)               Lefroy,       in    the Survey             of    1843–44.          It        is    situated
nearly due north                   of   the point      of   maximum deduced from that survey,
and less than 300 miles distant from                                  it.    The intensity              of   the force
        York Fort            in   July    1843, derived from the combined observations
of at                                                                                            by

with these Lieut. Blakiston's results                                in   August 1857, viz. 14:024 by

in   the magnetic moment                       of   the needle employed               in   the determination.
The first          of   these two last-named results has been computed                                         by   Mr.

  Welsh, of the Kew Observatory, from the observations received from
  Lieut. Blakiston, who was too much pressed for time by his ap
  proaching    departure     from   York Fort to compute                 them himself.
  The second is the     mean     of <U+FB01>ve determinations              on   three different
  days, which were computed by himself on the spot;                   they are severally
  as follows  :—

     We   have  therefore     by the mean of the two methods in 1843,
  14-05, and by the mean of the two methods in 1857, 1402,                           dif
 fering   only about   <U+FB01>lvth from each other.                    As far, therefore,   as
 agreement at a single station may be regarded                      as  con<U+FB01>rming    the
 conclusions    of the survey of 184344, Lieut. Blakiston’s results
 furnish that con<U+FB01>rmation; and judging from the result at the <U+FB01>rst
 station at which the comparison          has been made, we may anticipate,
 from the opportunities which        he is   likely     to have     of repeating obser
 vations at other stations     of the former survey,           as well as of adding sta
 tions previously unvisited, that the ultimate conclusion in respect to
 the absolute value of the magnetic force at its point of maximum at
 this particular magnetic epoch, will        be as perfect as could be desired.
 With respect to its present geographical position,                 we may also    hope
 that Lieut. Blakiston may have an opportunity, before his employ
 ment is terminated, of removing any doubts that may exist as to the
 precision of the longitude assigned to it by the survey of 1843-44.
 It  cannot have escaped       notice that the 78 stations of that survey,
 which by their combination assigned the latitude and longitude of
 the point of maximum, did not perfectly ful<U+FB01>l one important condi
 tion regarding   their distribution,      viz. that of symmetrical            arrange
 ment on all sides of the point in question.                 There was   a considerable
‘preponderance of stations situated on the west of the meridian of the
 point itself, and a de<U+FB01>ciency on the eastern                 side, which might have
 been remedied, had circumstances permitted,                   by a line of stations as
 originally contemplated on the        canoe      route from Canada to Moose

                                       86
Fort at the south-western        end of IIudson’s   Bay,   and possibly   by
some additional    stations between Moose Fort and       York Fort.     The
experience which Lieut. Blakiston has had in canoe-travelling           will
have prepared him to pro<U+FB01>t by the opportunities           it may afford for
observation, and the route referred to is one of the ordinary canoe
routes of the Hudson’s Bay Company: with this addition, the deter
minations of geographical      position and of the value of the magnetic
force at its point  of maximum, may       be expected to be amongst      the
most perfect, as they will undoubtedly       be amongst the most   import
ant data, in this great branch of Physical Geography.
    I proceed to notice Lieut. Blakiston’s observations upon the mag
netic declination at   York Fort, which, taken in conjunction with those
of the survey in 1843-44, tend to substantiate conclusions            of no
less  theoretical  importance     than  those with which we have been
occupied regarding the magnetic force.         It is well known   to those
who are conversant with the phenomena of the secular change          of the
declination,that   during the whole of the last century, and for some time
after the commencement of the present century, the secular change
which took place in the position of the isogonic lines in the northern
parts of the North American continent, consisted in the progressive
translation of the lines from west to east.     The line of no declination,
for example, to which, when Halley collected and coordinated the most
trustworthy observations previous to the publication of his Magnetical
Map in     1702,  be assigned a position     “about the meridian     of the
middle of California”      (Phil. Trans., No. 148), appears in Hansteen’s
‘
  Mappa hydrographica sistens Declinationes magneticas Anni 1787’
 (Erdmagnetismus,     Atlas), at the latter epoch, as crossing Lake Supe
rior, and proceeding from thence in a direction west of north, so as
to pass altogether to the west of any part of Hudson’s Bay; whilst
from well-assured observations of a still later date we know that soon
 after the beginning     of the present century, places situated on the
western shores of Hudson’s Bay had east declination, showing that
the line of no declination had passed over and was now to the east
 of them.     Consistently   with this generalmovement of the isogonic
lines from west to east,    the declination at York Fort, which, accord
ing to the observations       of Capt. Middleton      (Phil. Trans. 1726,
 N0. 393, and 1731, No. 418) was at least 19° West in 1725, had
 diminished to about 5° West in 1787 (Hansteen, l. 0.).         In Septem

                                          87
 her 1819 it    was found by    Sir John Franklin to      be 6° East (Journey
 to the Shores of the Polar Sea, 1819-22, p. 26), and by Lieut.
 Colonel Lefroy in 1843,      9° 25'   East.    Thus we perceive that in little
 more than a century (from 1725 to 1843) the declination at York
 Fort had changed progressively, by the operation of secular change,
 not  less than 28°, always     in the direction of westerly decreasing or
 easterly increasing;     (which is in effect the same as a movement of
translation of the isogonic lines from west to east).
    In 1841 the Toronto Observatory commenced its observations,
 and although (from defective instrumental organization) the conclu
 sions in regard to the secular change of the declination were not at
first   as precise as could be desired, they were su<U+FB02>iciently so to justify
 a strong    persuasion    that    some   very notable change had recently
 taken place in the order of the phenomena, and to lead to the com
 mencement, in January 1845, of a special series of monthly determi
 nations in a detached building, appropriated          chie<U+FB02>y to a close inves
 tigation into the direction and amount of the secular change.               The
result is stated in the 3rd volume of the Toronto Observations, p. cxxvi,
 and is as follows_:—“The secular change of the declination from
  1845 to 1851 inclusive was an annual increase of l' '95 of west decli
 nation.     From  July   1851 to    April 1854 (two years and nine months)
 an annual increase of     254   :   and assuming the circumstances of a new
 series commenced      in 1855 with the      same instrument placed    in a new
 building to    be strictly comparable with those of the old         series, the
 increase from    April 1854 to October       1855 is at the mean annual rate
 of 3"54.”      The progressively increasing amount of the rate of         secu
lar change is    a circumstance which, for obvious reasons, may be ex
 pected to follow for a time after the reversal of the direction of the
                        ‘
 change.
    Attention being thus alive, particular care was taken that the
 azimuth compass with which Lieut. Blakiston was supplied should
 be free from instrumental      error, and the practice was recommended
 to him of repeating observations at di<U+FB02>'erent hours and on different
 days.     The following is a transcript of the report received from him
 from York Fort, showing how thoroughly these directions were kept

   It  appears therefore that the secular variation which between 1819
and 1843 caused an increase of east declination, caused on the con
trary between l843 and 1857         a decrease       of  east    declination.        This
is a reversal in the same sense     as that    which has         been     seen to have
taken place at Toronto.      It  seems probable from an inspection                 of the
intervals,  and  of the differences of declination-value, in the three
determinations above noticed, that the epoch of reversal must have
coincided very nearly with that of the survey of_ 1843-44 ; and con
sequently that Lieut.-Col. Lefroy’s result may show approximately
the maximum which the easterly declination attained at York Fort
before the change took place.         If  we   might assume            1843 to be      the
precise epoch, it is deserving of. remark           that it is the same year             in
which the observations of the inclination             at  Toronto show that the
annual secular variation of that element changed from a decreasing
to an increasing    rate.    The dip observed by Lieut. Blakiston at
York Fort   was  83° 53' in 1857, and by Lieut.-Col. Lefroy 83° 4'/"'2
in 1843, showing,    as at Toronto, a slight increase to have taken place
in that element in the interval.
   I  am indebted   to Dr. Norton Shaw, Secretary of the Royal Geo
graphical Society, for a copy     of declinations observed by Mr. Palliser
in his passage between     Fort William and the Red River Settlement.

     At all the stations the easterly declination                           is    less    in 1857 than in
1843-44; and on the                average         of the four stations                   it   would        appear
to have decreased about 1° in the fourteen years.
     It   would be unjust to the memory of the profound                                        and sagacious
philosopher,       by whom, more than 150 years ago, the facts both of
the magnetic declination                in different parts of the globe and of its
changes were <U+FB01>rst collected and framed into an hypothesis (Halley
in Phil. Trans. 1692, No. 193),                  fail to recognize that
                                                       if   we were to
this reversal in the direction of the motion of the isogonic lines, in
the vicinity of the principal magnetic pole in the northern hemisphere
(using the term ‘pole’ in the physical sense in which Halley employed
it),   is   conformable    to the hypothesis which he propounded                                        at that
early date,—“ to explain,”                    according to        his own words, “ the change
in the variation (declination) of the magnetic needle.”    By the sup-v
position of     double system of the terrestrial magnetic forces, occa
                  a
sioning        two poles or principal points                      of attraction in each hemi
sphere producing          resultant phenomena in all parts of the surface of
the globe according         to their relative strength and proximity, Halley
showed that all the apparently complex phenomena of the magnetic
direction        might   be systematically                  represented;            and by the further
supposition that one of the two systems (the stronger one) was <U+FB01>xed,
and the other (the weaker one) possessed    gradual and slow motion,  a
that      a   reasonable explanation               could be given of the phenomena of
the secular change in different parts of the globe, as far as they were
known in his time. At the period when this hypothesis was ori
ginated, viz. in 1692, the two poles in the northern hemisphere were
considered to be situated                as    follows      :   that of the stronger and <U+FB01>xed

                                         90
   system in North America,       about the meridian of the middle       of Cali
   fornia, and that of the weaker and moving          system, about the meri
   dian of the British Islands, having a progressive motion towards the
   east.    Now   as  the resultant phenomena in the north         of America,
   though in<U+FB02>uenced       principally by the nearer and stronger system,
   would still exhibit in a slighter    degree  the in<U+FB02>uence     of the weaker
   and moving      system,   the isogonic lines in that part of the globe
   should have, according to the hypothesis,       a movement     of translation
   from west to east conformably      to the motion     of the weaker system,
   until the di<U+FB01>'erence in longitude between the poles of the respective
   systems should amount to 180°, an event which would constitute an
   epoch in the secular magnetic variations, characterized (amongst
   other circumstances) by the reversal of the motion of the isogonic
  lines in America, which would thenceforward          take place from east to
  west, as the distance between the poles should diminish on the Sibe
  rian side   of what Halley termed the American Pole. Now it is well
  known that the expedition of MM. Hansteen, Erman, and Due, across
  the continents     of Europe and Asia in 1828 and 1829, had, for its
  principal object, the determination of the magnetic phenomena around
  the point of maximum attractive force of the weaker or moving sy
  stem    ; and that the position those gentlemen assigned to it in longi
  tude at the time of this expedition was about 115° East of Greenwich,
  to which meridian it had progressively moved in the interval which
  had elapsed since Halley assigned its position         near the meridian     of
  our Islands.      Fully recognizing that in the present,    as in the   earlier
 state    of magnetical science  we can   only regard such assignments         as
 approximate, we have still full reason to believe that about the time
 of the memorable expedition of         MM.    Hansteen,    Erman, and Due,
 i.  e. a few years earlier or a few years later than     1828-29, the epoch
 must have occurred when the points         of greatest attraction of the two
 systems in the northern hemisphere must have passed through their
 greatest longitudinal distance from each other, and when, according
 to Halley’s hypothesis, the direction of the movement of translation
 of the isogonic lines in the northern parts of America should be
 reversed, which we <U+FB01>nd to have now taken place.
     I   have ventured    to think that these few remarks,        recalling   to
recollection     an hypothesis   which    was  not framed without a most
laborious     coordination   and sagacious grouping       of the phenomena

                                      91
 which it professed to represent, and which has its place in the earlier
 volumes of our Transactions, would not be unacceptable to the Mem
 bers of the Royal Society, of which Society Halley has ever been
 regarded as one of the brightest ornaments.

                                  (Abstract.)
    Dr. Frankland, in his valuable memoir communicated to the Royal
 Society, has pointed out that hydrargyro-methylium, zinc-ethylium,
 and analogous bodies may be regarded as formed upon the type                of
 the metallic oxides, the oxygen of which he considered was repre
sented by methyl, ethyl, &c.        The hypothetical radical hydrargyro
 methylium,     C2  H,        according to this view would correspond to
numerous oxides, O
    Diinhaupt and Strecker have studied and described the salts of
hydrargyro-methylium and hydrargyraethylium, but chemists do not
appear, hitherto, to have succeeded in reducing these bodies to the
 mercuric type, or in preparing the metalloids themselves.
    The author has undertaken experiments with a view to the com
pletion of this portion of their history, a brief summary of which he
now offers.                                                               .
   Iodide of hydrargyro-methylium was prepared through the agency
of sunlight, in the usual manner; and after the removal of every
trace of iodide of methyl,      it was intimately   mixed in a mortar with
<U+FB01>nely powdered cyanide of potassium.           Small charges were then in
troduced into <U+FB02>asks and distilled over the gas <U+FB02>ame.            Gaseous and
solid products    are formed, together   with  a heavy  liquid, which  passes
into the receiver.      After washing with water, and recti<U+FB01>cation over
chloride of calcium, this liquid has the following properties :—
   It  is colourless, highly refractive to light, and almost wholly in
soluble in water.     When pure, it has     a faint and somewhat sweetish
odour.     It is very combustible,     and burns with a luminous        <U+FB02>ame
and abundant      evolution  of mercurial vapour.      It  is very soluble in

                                         92
alcohol   and in ether, from       the former of which        it precipitates on
addition of water.     lts boiling-point lies between 93° and 96° C, and
its speci<U+FB01>c gravity      is  3069.      It  thus   appears   to have a weight
greater than any known non-metallic           liquid at ordinary temperature.
    By analysis it  gave    numbers according with the formula
                                     C,II,Hg.
    The formation of this body is readily intelligible from the following
equation,   if we  neglect secondary decompositions,
             c,n,ug,, 1+ KCy=C,II,Ilg+ Kl                + Cy +11,;.
    The cyanogen      does    not, however,      appear as liberated gas, but
 remains behind in the form of paracyanogen.
    From the constitution of this substance, the name mercuric methyl
 is proposed.     Should this appellation be accepted, Dr. F rankland's
radical would be styled mercurous methyl.
    To control the analysis, and further corroborate the formula, the
speci<U+FB01>c gravity     of the vapour was taken after Dumas’s method.
 It was found to be l4'86.         The weight represented by theformula
 C,H,lIg,    divided   by the experimental        density,  gives the quotient
 7'73.   Supposing     the constituents      of mercuric    methyl condensed
into   one volume    of vapour, the number 7'23 should have been ob
 tained.
    The theoretical density of mercuric methyl is                            It is,
                                                            %l%=l5'9.
however, more probable that the elements of this compound are con
densed into two volumes, whence the formula should be doubled to
 (C2H3)2Hga
    Mercuric methyl may also be obtained, but less readily, by em
ploying hydrate of potassa or lime, instead of an alkaline cyanide.
    In this reaction much gas is liberated.
  2(C,H,Hg,,I) + 2KOHO= C,H,Hg + C,H4                  + 3HgO +     H0   + 2KI.
    Mercuric methyl       exhibits   no tendency to unite with the electro~
negative elements, such as chlorine, oxygen, &c.                All attempts     to
produce such combinations lead to the destruction             of the substance.
With iodine or bromine the liquid hisses          as if hot metal were plunged
into water.     Methyl     gas  is liberated, and the iodide or bromide          of
mercurous methyl is produced:—

    The salts of mercurous methyl, and the radical mercuric methyl,
are both decomposed by the action of a dilute acid and clean zinc,
into metallic mercury and gases.
    Mercuric methyl furnishes with bichloride          of tin   a crystalline
compound, which decomposes, on addition of water, into chloride of
mercurous methyl and a soluble tin salt.          The  same chloride also is
produced by the action of terchloride of phosphorus.
    Mercuric methyl is     a ready  solvent of caoutchouc,       resins, and
phosphorus.      It, however, has but little solvent action on sulphur.
    Some interest attaches to the circumstance          that iodide of mer
curous methyl is easily produced        by heating mercuric iodide with
mercuric methyl.

its proneness, however, to decomposition at the high temperature at
which the reaction is effected, he has not        been able  to obtain more
than su<U+FB01>icient     to make a qualitative   examination     of the new body.
It  boils at a temperature above that of water, and burns with a more
lurid <U+FB02>ame than is exhibited by mercuric methyl.

was recalled to the subject by two remarkable                                     identities obtained in
Prof. Donkin’s memoir, “On the equation of Laplace's Functions,

identities    I       perceived to belong to the class of formulae above                                           re
ferred   to: the first of the two identities is in fact readily deduced from
a formula in my paper; the demonstration                        of the second is much

   All   the metals were the same as those used for my thermo-electric
experiments, with the exception of cadmium, which was purified by
my friend Mr. B. Jegel.
  The alloys of bismuth-antimony,                                    bismuth-tin,     antimony and zinc
were determined in order to ascertain whether, as they give, with other
metals, such strong thermo-electric currents, they might be more                                               ad
vantageously employed for thermo-electric                                    batteries than those              con
structed    of bismuth and antimony.
  Coppers      No.     1,    2, 3 were wires of commerce.                                No.        1   contained
small quantities of lead, tin, zinc, and nickel.                                    The low conducting
power of No.       1    is owing,                  as Professor          Bunsen      thinks, to a small
quantity of suboxide being dissolved up in                                   it.

                                               of
Brodie's patent and pressed                         by    Mr. Cartmell,        to   whom  I        am indebted
for the above.
  The conducting power for gas-coke, graphite, and Bumsen's bat
tery-coke increases               by    heat from                0°    to    140°C.;     it    increases for
each degree 0.00245,              i.    e.     at    0°C, the conducting power                      =   100, and

                                             97
    between the common temperature and a              light red heat about 12 per
    cent.    The following metals were chemically pure :—Silver, gold,
    zinc, cadmium, tin, lead, antimony,          quicksilver,   bismuth,      tellurinm.
    Those    pressed were       sodium, zinc, magnesium,          calcium,    cadmium,
    potassium,    tin, lead, strontium,      antimony,    bismuth,      tellurium, and
    the alloys of bismuth-antimony         and bismuth-tin.         The way in which
    these wires were made is described          in the ‘Philosophical Magazine’
    for February 1857.

          THIESSEN, Ph.D. Communicated by Cnaanss WHEAT
          STONE, Esq.        Received November 20, 1857.
                                       [Abstract]
                                                                ‘
       Being enabled by the method described in the Philosophical Ma
   gazine’ (Feb. 185 7) to obtain wires of the metals of the alkalies and
   alkaline earths,    I  have determined their places, together with those
   of most of the other metals, in the thermo~electric              series.
       If A, B, C     are   different   metals,   and    (AB), (BC), (CA)            the
   electromotive powers of thermo-elements             formed out of each two of
  these    metals, whose alternate soldering points           are at two different
  temperatures, so is      (AB) + (BC) + (CA) =              0, and therefore
                                     (AB)=a-6,
                                     (BC)=b—c,
                                     (CA)=c-—a,
  where the values a, b,      c  not only depend on the two temperatures, but
  also on the nature of each of the metals          A, B, C.       As the differences
  of the same constitute the electromotive powers, the value for either
  of these metals maybe put = 0.
      If the  temperatures      of the soldering points of        a thermo-element
 only vary slightly, the electromotive powers may be said to be in
 ratio with the difference of the two temperatures, and under the
 same conditions        the values a, b, and      c  are  also in ratio      with the
ditference      of the temperatures,        and their relations        to each    other
therefore independent of the           same.

  If now    the value of the second metal relative to the above value
of the first be taken equal to            of the others, in relation
                                                     1, the values
to these, become constants, and only depend on the nature of each
metal; these values            I   will call the Thermo-electric                                          Constants.                     The
results obtained are given in the following Table, where the thermo
electric constant of chemically pure silver is taken                                                      = 0,           and that             of

   The method by which these determinations were made is the
following:—Two thermo-elements, whose warm and cold soldering
points had the     same temperatures, were compared                               with each other;
these formed a circuit with the coil                      of    a   multiplicator, which sur
rounded a magnet rod (of about a pound weight) to which was                                     fast
ened a piece of looking-glass, thereby allowing the deflections of the
magnet to be observed at a distance by means                                   of   a telescope and
scale,   in the same manner           as observations are made                        with the mag
metometer.      Two commutators             were     also brought into the circuit; the
one changed the direction of the current in the wire of the                                  multipli
                                                                                     H    2

cator, the other allowed the currents of the thermo-elements                                    to pass
either so as to strengthen, or so as to oppose each other.
     The foregoing experiments were carried out in the Physical Ca
binet at Heidelberg, under             the direction                of Professor      Kirchhoff,        to
whose advice and assistance             I   am much indebted.

     The term matrix might             be used     in a more general                   sense,      but in
the present memoir          I   consider only square and rectangular matrices,
and the term matrix used without quali<U+FB01>cation                                   is to be understood
as meaning a square matrix             ;    in this restricted sense, a set                   of quan
tities arranged in the form           of    a square, e.            g.

and the consideration            of such        a      system       of equations leads to most
of the fundamental notions in the theory of matrices. It will be
seen that matrices (attending only to those of the same degree) com
port themselves as single quantities                     ;      they may be added, multiplied,
or compounded together, &c. the law of the addition of matrices
                                            :                                                           is
precisely similar to that for the addition of ordinary algebraical quan
tities;   as regardstheir multiplication (or composition), there    the                            is
peculiarity that matrices are not in general convertible;        never                  it    is
theless possiblelto form the powers (positive or negative, integral or

                                         101
fractional)   of  a matrix,      and thence to arrive at the notion        of a
rational and integral       function, or generally of any algebraical func
tion of a matrix.      I  obtain the remarkable theorem that any matrix
whatever satis<U+FB01>es an algebraical equation of its own order, the coe<U+FB02>i
cient of the highest power being unity, and those of the other powers
functions of the terms of the matrix, the last coe<U+FB01>icient being in fact
the determinant.      The rule for the formation of this equation may be
stated in the following condensed form, which will be intelligible
after a perusal of the memoir, viz. the determinant, formed out of
the matrix diminished         by the matrix considered as a single quantity
involving   the matrix unity, will be equal to zero.             The theorem
shows that every rational           and integral   function  (or indeed every
rational function) of a matrix          may be considered as a rational and
integral function, the degree of which is at most equal to that of the
matrix, less unity    ;  it   even   shows that in a sense, the same is true
with respect to any algebraical function whatever of a matrix.              One
of the applications of the theorem is the <U+FB01>nding of the general ex
pression of the matrices which are convertible with a given matrix.
The theory of rectangular matrices appears much less important
than that of square matrices, and I have not entered into it further
than by showing how some of the notions applicable                to these may
be extended to rectangular matrices.

       a Bipartite Quadric Function.”                  By ARTHUR CAYLEY,
       Esq., F.R.S.         Received December 10, 1857.
                                     [Abstract]
   The question of the automorphic              linear transformation    of the
function    .z'”+g/2+2’,     that   is the transformation    by linear   substi
tutions, of this function         into a function    .z*f+y,’+z,’ of the   same
form, is in effect solved by some formulae of Euler’s for the transform
ation of coordinates, and it was by these formulae that I was led
to the solution in the         case   of the sum of    n squares, given  in my
paper “ Sur quelques propriétés des determinants gauches,” Crelle,
t. xxxii. pp. ll9—l23 (1846). A solution grounded upon an &-priori

was <U+FB01>rst obtained by M. Hermite in the memoir

une Mémoire de M. Cayley relatif aux determinants gauches,” Cam
bridge and Dublin Mathematical             Journal, t. ix. pp. 63-67 (1854).
This solution is in my Memoir            “  Sur la transformation d’une func
tion quadratique en elle-méme par des substitutions linéaires,” Crelle,
t. 1. pp. 288-299 (1855), presented under a somewhat different form
involving    the notation of matrices.        I  have since found that there is
a  like transformation of    a bipartite     quadric function, that is a lineo
linear function     of two distinct     sets,   each    of the  same    number   of
variables, and the development          of the transformation       is the subject
of the present memoir.

    In this paper the author describes the method adopted by him for
 the separation of the three classes of hydrocarbons forming the more
 volatile portion    of the distillate.      On treatment with bromine           in
presence    of water, the naphtha is entirely converted into           a heavy  oil,
 containing the C“ H“ series chemically, and propyle and benzole me
 chanically    combined.     The two latter may            be removed     by mere
 distillation on the water-bath.        They    are easily separable ‘by    fuming
 nitric acid, the benzole being dissolved while the propyle is un
 touched.      The nitro-benzole obtained in this manner, on treatment
 by Béchamp’s process, yields aniline mixed with a little toluidine, but
 no bases belonging to any other class.
    The bromine compound (in consequence of its preparation in pre
 sence of water) could not be obtained free from oxygen. When kept
 for  some   time it separates    into three layers, the upper being water
 faintly acidulated with hydrobromic           acid, the middle bromine       com
 pound,    and the lower, hydrobromic           acid of 37 per cent.,      and the

alcoholic potash and sodium, undergo a curious decomposition, the

            Received November 30, 1857.
   After referring            to   the well-known phenomena manifested                                 by     elec
trical fishes, and           to   alleged instances         of   numbing effects, but                 of  doubt
ful electrical nature, produced                       on   the naked hand                 by    the contact       of

tions and experiments with the Actinia                               as   follows:–
   Suppose that into               a   vessel containing some actiniae well expanded,
and apparently           on   the look-out for food, some                        of   the tadpoles         of   the
common frog             be   introduced, these little creatures                         do   not, like many
freshwater         fishes     of   about the same               dimensions, immediately                         die;
 on   the contrary, the salt water seems                        to   stimulate their activity, they
become very lively and swim about with vivacity.                                        One      of   them may
not unfrequently              be   observed      to   make       its   way among the tentacles                    of

                                           104
  an actinia and get      05 again quite uninjured ; it may even for a time
  nestle among the tentacles with as much impunity as if it were only
  in contact with a piece of sea-weed; but should the tadpole have the
  misfortune     to fall in with a more voracious actinia, the reception             it
   meets with is very different.      Sometimes, when by an       incautious lash of
  its tail it touches even a single tentacle, it may at once be laid hold
  of, and in the violent efforts which it forthwith makes to break loose,
  often merely      brings   itself within the reach of other tentacles, by
  which it is seized and overpowered.              Occasionally,     however,    after
  having been thus seized, the tadpole by its superior activity succeeds
  in effecting its escape, and when it does so, it seems for a time sin
  gularly excited; it twists and writhes and wriggles through the
  water, so as to leave no doubt that some very remarkable in<U+FB02>uence has
  been exerted upon      it.
     These observations are no doubt familiar to all who have studied
 the habits     of these animals; for although the tadpole seems more
 susceptible of the peculiar stimulus which the actinia can com
  municate than most of those creatures which are ordinarily cast in
 its way, yet the same          occurrences    take place with the small crus
 taceans, &c. which are abundant in sea-water.               Indeed no very close
 attention is necessary to perceive, that while on some occasions these
 little animals may creep to and fro over the surface and among the
 tentacles of the actinia, at other times they are seized and killed with
 the greatest promptitude.
     It remained to be determined what              is the exact nature       of the
 power which the actinia has been thus found to have under its con
 trol.   If   it seized its victim by        a simple    mechanical     effort, why
 should     the   tadpole    be   so   agitated   for  some    time   after  having
escaped      from its grasp?         No peculiarly    viscid   secretion could be
detected on the tentacles, nor could any decided reaction be discerned
on their surface dilfering from the feebly alkaline                condition  of the
sea—water     in which they were placed; moreover, the power of the
actinia    seemed    often to be exerted with too much promptness to be
compatible with the notion          of the formation of a poisonous or sting
ing <U+FB02>uid over its surface.
     On the hypothesis        that it is an electrical power with which the
actiniae   are endowed, it is obvious that the existence            of animal   elec
tricity in them ought           to be experimentally        demonstrable      by its

                                                    105
physiological effects, inasmuch                     as    these phenomena        are the most
striking which animal electricity is capable of producing in common
with other electricities derived from different sources.
      The following experiments, in which the frog’s limb                          was used as
a galvanometer (the limb of this animal being, as is well known, an
instrument of extreme delicacy for this purpose), seem satisfactorily
to establish          the fact that the common                   actiniae   of our shores    are
gifted with electrical power.
      lst. Having prepared the lower limb of                          a   lively frog after the
mode described by Matteucci, by stripping off the skin, dissecting
out the sciatic nerve from among the muscles                          of the thigh, and then
cutting off the thigh              a   little above the knee,       so as to leave the nerve
uninjured and              as   long    as possible,       the limb was laid on a small
piece        of glass,     so that the nerve             hung down over its       edge.     The
pendent nerve was                lowered     into    the water and gently brought in
contact with the tentacles of an expanded actinia.                           From the <U+FB01>rst or
the      second,      or    even       several, possibly         no effect may result,      but
arriving at last at one more vigorous                         than his neighbours,        smart
muscular           contractions follow as he grasps the nerve in his tentacles,
and the toes are thrown into active movement.
      2nd. The next experiment, although of precisely the same nature
as    that <U+FB01>rst detailed, renders the effect produced on the muscles of
the frog’s limb more striking.                  A    large and lively frog is killed, the
skin is stripped off, and the viscera being removed, the body is cut
off about the middle ; a knife being slipped behind the lumbar
plexus of nerves, the pelvic bones and contiguous soft parts are cut
away, so that the lumbar vertebrae remain connected with the lower
extremities merely by the nervous cords passing to each limb.                             Thus
prepared,          the limbs are laid on a thin piece of board, so that the
vertebrae       hang over its edge dangling by the undivided nerves.                       The
piece of board is placed <U+FB02>oating on the surface of the water in which
are the actinise, and is slowly pushed over within reach of an active
one.         Immediately        that the actinia         seizes the morsel thus offered to
it,   contractions are observed to commence in the thigh, extend to the
calf, and soon the toes are in movement.
      3rd.    In   order to set aside the supposition that these muscular con
tractions       might      be the result      of chemical or mechanical irritation
applied to the extremities of the nerves,                   it   became necessary to devise

                                                                  106
a modification               of the foregoing experiments;                                  for although irritants,
such as turpentine,                  croton oil, ammonia, friction with a nettle leaf,
&c., were applied to the nerves without producing                                                         any effect like
that obtained from the actiniae, it seemed still possible that the con
tractions might be due to some other agent than electricity.
   The following experiment seems to remove        doubt.      piece                        all                 A             of
copper wire,                 few inches long, was coated with sealing-wax, except
about half            an a   inch       at   each end; the ends were rubbed clean with
sand-paper, one               of    them was thrust into the lower part                                     of   the spinal
           of        frog prepared                                the last experiment, while the other,
                                                          an in
                                               on to as

nerves and vertebrae attached, are laid                                         on   a   piece    of   board, while the
copper wire, which                  is   curved, arches over the edge                                of   it;    so   that the
end covered with frog's intestine can   readily brought within the              be

is   placed floating               on   the water, and the frog's intestine offered                                      to   an
actinia;         muscular            contractions                      ensue,        perhaps      not       so   promptly,

then the toes move actively.                                This last experiment has                       been modified
in   a   variety     of   ways, but the same result has been constantly obtained.

canal     of    the frog.            The whole, except the surface   the disk, which
is   to    be   given        to    the actinia, and the point for the spinal canal,                                           is
covered with sealing-wax, and the frog's limbs extended upon                                                           a    thin
piece      of    board.            With      this arrangement precisely the same effects
were produced                as    already described.
     It   is    a    remarkable              fact, and deserves                       special notice, that
                                                                                                         all            in
these experiments the muscular                                         contractions,    when once  strongly

influence        of the actinia in the first experiments, or removed from
the wire in the last, strong muscular contractions                    continue to take
place for from three to five minutes.
     All    the varieties   of actinia which have hitherto             been      made the
subject of experiment, have given similar evidence of electrical power,
but by no means in an equal degree. The large varieties are found,
in proportion to their size, much feebler than those of less dimen
sions, and any attempt to succeed in the experiment with the copper
wire has failed with them.
     A somewhat       similar observation has        Dr. John Davy
                                                      been made by
regarding the torpedo, for he tells us (Philosophical Transactions,
1834, p. 548) that he has seen strong vivacious fish which made
great muscular exertions in the water, almost or entirely destitute                       of
electrical action.
     It    is obvious that in creatures of such moderate dimensions                       as
actiniae,    of   so peculiar       a form and      of such    feeble power, much       dif
ficulty is to be expected in demonstrating the other experimental
effects which animal electricityis capable of producing in common
with other electricities, viz. magnetic deflection,-magnetising of
needles,—spark,-heating power, and chemical action; and it must
be admitted that         all   experiments hitherto undertaken             on   this subject
have been attended with negative results.                 I    hope, and indeed expect,
when further opportunities             are afforded    of   examining these creatures
in   health and vigour         in   their native pools,   to   obtain more satisfactory
results      on   these points, when    I   shall look forward       to   the pleasure    of
making       a   further communication         on   the subject.

  The following communication              was read      :
“ On    the Physical Structure            of the Old Red Sandstone of the
       County of Waterford, considered with relation to Cleavage,
       Joint Surfaces, and Faults.” By the Rev. SAMUEL Haven
       TON, Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, and Professor of
       Geology. Communicated by Dr. TYNDALL, F.R.S. Received
       January 19, 1858.
   After describing the general features of the district and giving his
reasons for selecting it, the author proceeds to give a detailed account
of the faults, joint surfaces, and cleavage planes, 345 in number,
observed by him during the course of his survey.
  The faults      are nineteen in number              and reducible to two pairs            of
rectangular systems. The bearings of these systems are E. 7°                            30' N.
and E. 34° 22' N.  The other faults, which form nearly right angles
with the preceding and may be called Conjugate Faults, have the
following bearings,        N. 3° 45' W. and N. 33° 24' W.
  The author considers that the existence of two systems of conju
gate faults indicates two distinct systems of upheaving force in the
district;    a supposition     which is strongly con<U+FB01>rmed                   by the fact that
the average      strike of the beds is           E.   10° 46'     N.,     a direction   inter
mediate between those           of the systems of faults.                  He then demon
strates from      345 observed planes, that                    of joint and
                                                             the systems
cleavage     planes are also conjugate systems, reducible to four, of which
two are      identical with the two conjugate systems of faults already
established.      The      average     observed angles between the conjugate
axes   of   these four systems       of planes    are 89°     1   1',   91C 52', 91° 20', and
90° 30' respectively;        and the bearings of their cleavage planes are—

                                        109
                     Cleavage.                        Faults.
              7° 46'  North of East.         7° 30'  North of East.
             33° 31' North of East.         34° 22' North     of East.
            30° 30' South of East.
             10°     South of East.
    The cleavage planes        are distinguished   from the joint planes by a
peculiar <U+FB02>aggy or platy structure developed in the rock-mass, parallel
to their direction.     This structure the author thinks to be the result
of pressure; and that it indicates that the cleavage planes              are per
pendicular to the lines of maximum force ; he considers the             cleavage
planes   to have been developed while the rock was yet soft.                 The
joint planes, on the contrary, which          are   conjugate    to the cleavage
 planes,  are  considered    as perpendicular     to the lines      of minimum
force  of compression     ; they were formed by the shrinking of the rock
 mass, were subsequent to the cleavage planes, and formed when the
 rock  was  hard.
    Having established the geometrical relations of the structural planes
 of the conglomerate, the author then deduces from them the mecha
 nical forces which have been at work in bringing the district to its
 present   condition   and form.      He believes that the method he has
 adopted in reference to the conglomerate         of the county of Waterford
 is applicable to the physical structure of other districts; and that
 his results,  if con<U+FB01>rmed       by corresponding    results in other districts,
 of which he is con<U+FB01>dent, will prove to be a substantial addition to
 the arguments in favour of the mechanical theory of slaty cleavage.
    The paper was accompanied by four diagrams illustrative of the
 cleavage and joint planes of Portally Head, Swiny Head, Shanooan
 Head, and of the reversed fault at Portnashrughann.

 La démonstration serait la même pour deux machines de Wolf
   On peut remarquer que le théorème précédent aura lieu qu'elle
 que soit la détente, pourvu que les volumes d'admissions restent
 égaux. Seulement, la vaporisation commune variera avec la pression,
 et dans le même sens.
      Il
       résulte de ce qui précède que dans deux machines de méme
 système, l'une à condensation, l'autre sans condensation, travaillant
 à la détente du maximum d'effet, et dont les capacités homologues
 du système distributeur sont dans les rapports indiqués ci-dessus, une
 méme quantité d'eau vaporisée produira le méme travail aux limites
 de la pression. Ce travail pourra aussi être rendu égal pour de
 certaines pressions moindres que les pressions limites.

action of nitrous acid on aniline,                        I
                                   found that the reaction does not
take place exactly as these chemists state;                                   Hunt gives the reaction
aS

     Hofmann says that phenylic alcohol is not formed, but nitrophe
massic acid, when binoxide                      of nitrogen is led into                 a diluted   solution
of the mitrate:
          Cl2     H.                                               H

  This reaction, although correct in the                               end result, omits          the   inter
mediate stage, which is—
            Cis H5
                      H >N+H, O, + NO3=C1,                           He O2     +NH3+NOs,
                      H
and then          NH3+NO3=N,+3HO.
     On account of the free nitric acid, the phenylic alcohol is always
converted into nitrophenassic                          acid.       The ammonia was determined
as platinum            salt, and two experiments gave 43.9 and 44.1 per cent.
of platinum; the theoretical quantity required is 44.2 per cent.
     It   appears, therefore, when nitrous acid acts on aniline, that                                      in
the first part of the reaction                    it   causes      only      a substitution,      and   after
wards, the ammonia being attacked by                                    it,   gives off nitrogen         and
Water.

   Ammonia was obtained either by treating aniline with nitrous acid,
or by the action of nitrate of potash on the chloride, or by leading
the binoxide of nitrogen                    into a solution          of the nitrate; the latter
was the way generally employed.                           After about twelve hours' action
of NO, on a solution of the nitrate in                              a water-bath,               the solution
was filtered from the nitrophenassic acid, and distilled with potash,
the distillate treated with ether to dissolve out the aniline, redistilled
in hydrochloric acid, evaporated, and the ammonia determined as
platinum        salt.       These      results       have led me to try the action                                  of
nitrous acid on other organic bases, and                        I have already                 obtained from
ethylaniline        a base which              to    all   appearance           is    ethylamin.                   The

chloride gives off, when heated with potash,                                   alkaline inflammable
gas, and        the platinum salt resembles that                                  ethylamin; but the
platinum        determination          made with          it   does not agree very                  well with
                        am now repeating the reaction                    on       larger scale,                   that

   Another observer, Dr. Schenk*, has lately noticed the occurrence
of starch in            a state        of solution in the epidermal cells of the stem,
leaves, and other parts of Ornithogalum nutans and Ornithogalum
lanceolatum.   These cells were found to contain (besides nuclei) a
thick homogeneous fluid. Tincture of iodine coloured the fluid first
wine-red, then violet, and finally indigo-blue; and the fluid at the
same time            lost       its   homogeneous nature, and became                                     finely granular
and flocculent.

the contents, and                 if      the former,      it     is    as     likely that the colour (being
clear blue) arose from the presence                                of    cellulose         in   a    young condition,

isolated sacs            or      asci containing               sporidia; and              a     few     of    the plants
which were              in   a   younger state than the rest exhibited asci                                     in   abun
dance, showing satisfactorily that the fungus must                                              be   classed    with the
Ascomycetes,—not with the Gasteromycetes.
     There        is   no    doubt that the asci are absorbed                                 at     an   early period,
and the sporidia then form                         a    dense mass.
  It    is   exceedingly difficult, from the crowded state                                           of   the contents,
to    trace out the manner                         in   which        the asci originate; but                    I       have
satisfied myself that they spring    intervals from threads proceed

                                      these threads with the asci springing                                     from
magnified 315 diameters.                            The asci themselves are broadly clavate,
with    a    very short stem, and are frequently,                               if      not usually, drawn out
at   the apex into             a      sort   of   point,       as   shown     in    figs.     2,3       and   4.
     The      sporidia are extremely curious.                                 They are globular and co
lourless, and furnished with long delicate sharp rays projecting from
the surface            in    every direction.                Each sporidium                is   furnished with              an
internal nucleus,                     or   probably        oil-drop (sometimes broken                              up   into

                                                   122
several), which          varies somewhat in size, and is sometimes in the
centre     of the globe, sometimes placed eccentrically.                                       Their form
will be    seen   by reference to fig. 5.
     The average diameter of the sporidia is about                                #55th of           an   inch.
Upon placing         a   thin section of one of               the plants in water under the
microscope, and adding a drop                   of solution of iodine, the sporidia in
the course of a few seconds                    assume a more or less dark                             purple
colour, precisely similar to that produced in starch by the same                                             re
agent; and not only            are the sporidia themselves thus affected, but
the fluid surrounding          them is tinged of an intense purple colour for
some distance round the mass                   of sporidia.              This latter colouring                  is
doubtless produced by the effect                    of    the iodine upon a viscid matter
which surrounds the sporidia, and which may either originate in the
disintegration        of the asci, or may be an independent                                     secretion.
There     can be     little doubt,       I think,      that this viscid matter is starch
in   a state   of solution.         It
                             might be taken for dextrine, but that it
differs from that substance in assuming a purple colour under iodine.
   The sporidia, although coloured by iodine in the same manner as
starch-granules*,         do not exhibit any cross when viewed by polarized
light.      The small size of the Fungi precludes the possibility of                                       pro
curing a sufficient quantity of the viscid matter to test                                its   effect upon
the plane      of   polarization.
I    find the sporidia unaffected     boiling water  by even    long                or               by
soaking     sulphuric acid,
            in                 which respect they differ from starch
                                         in
granules.         The purple colour, however (as                        is   the case with starch),
disappears under the action               of   heat      or   of   alcohol.
I      have named the plant Amylocarpus                             encephaloides, for reasons
sufficiently      obvious     from       the above description.                         Its systematic
position  certainly with the Tuberacei, but
            is                                                               ithas       no
                                                                                      near allies.
The only plant resembling       structure it   in                        is   Endogone, but                it   is
doubtful whether the vesicles                 of   Endogone             be   spores     or   asci.    If    the
latter, the affinity with Endogone would                           be   close.
     In   conclusion     I   may mention, that                in   a    very late number              of    the

fore, that the absence          of starch can no longer     be considered as cha
racteristic    of the Fungi, and that the existence of that substance in
an amorphous state may be considered as satisfactorily                proved.

     In this paper the writer exhibited tables of the movements of
meteorological       instruments      registered      at Toronto in       1846, in the
months     of January and July,           as specimens        of the changes which
take place in the atmosphere in winter and summer.                        The principal
object was to <U+FB01>nd the cause of the fall of the barometer in the middle
of the day.    The author endeavours to show that the vapour, which
in the early part of the day was produced              by
                                            solar heat at the surface,
by its expansive power, bore that heat to the upper regions                        of the
air, where   it   was condensed by the cold          of the   gases   in that situation,
when the heat of elasticity was set at liberty to warm and expand
the gases, and that      it   was this expansion which reduced atmospheric
pressure in the locality and caused            a   fall of the barometer.

        By PHILIP HENRY GossE, Esq., F.R.S.                                    Received January
        18, 1858.

  The organs which have been termed “thread-cells,” “thread
capsules,”       “urticating organs,” “lasso-cells,” &c.,                              I propose        to call
cnidae.      They are found in various tissues of the body, but are
specially localized in two sets                   of organs, which            I    call craspeda and
acontia.       The craspeda are gelatinous cords connected throughout
their length with the free                edges    of the muscular            septa.           The acontia
are somewhat similar                 cords, but free throughout,                        except at their
base, where they are inserted into the septa.                               The cord-like appear
ance    of these latter organs              is,   however, illusory,              as    each   is  a   narrow
ribbon with involute margins.                       Both the craspeda and the acontia
are composed             of
                          a   clear plasma,        in   which many cnidae are crowded.
      The craspeda appear              to   be    universally possessed                  by
                                                                                   this tribe                  of
animals, but the acontia are limited                           to   a   few genera, principally
Sagartia and Adamsia. They are ejected from the body                                                    of   the
animal, and are again withdrawn.
      For the emission          of    these organs special orifices exist, which                             I
                                                                                    in of
term      cinclides.          These       are minute         perforations                   the muscular
coats and the integument, bearing                        a   resemblance                    appearance         to
the spiracles        of   insects.     Being placed            in   the interseptal spaces, they
have    a   perpendicular arrangement, but are not regularly disposed                                          in
any other respect.              They can           be   opened widely,             or    perfectly closed
at the will   the animal; and are well

tended      in a    parallel-sided glass vessel, with                   a   strong light behind                it.
The width      these orifices varies from #5th

No ciliary current passes through them.
  Under irritation the Sagartia forcibly and repeatedly contracts                                              its
body, forcing out the water which had distended    aquiferous canals              its

escape         in a loop or bight, shows that the issue is the result of a
merely mechanical action, viz. that of the escaping water.
  The cnidae occur under four distinct forms.    1. Chambered cnidae
(Cnidae cameratae).  This is the most widely distributed, and the
most elaborately armed.  In Cyathina Smithii they occur of com
paratively large size, and are therefore well suited for observation.
They are transparent, colourless vesicles, of                            a long, oval figure,         #5th
of   an inch in length, and                #57th in diameter.                  A   fusiform chamber
passes         through       the centre of the anterior moiety, merging at one
extremity into the walls of the cnida, and at the other diminishing to
a slender chord, which is irregularly coiled within the general cavity.
     Under stimulus               the cnidae suddenly               expel their contents with
great force.               In general the        eye can scarcely follow                    the excessive
rapidity with which the chamber and       twining thread are shot  its
forth. When fully expelled, the thread, which distinguish by the              I
term ecthoraeum,             is   often thirty times           as   long      as   the cnida; but             in
Sagartia generally,            it      frequently    is   not more than once and                     a    half
the length           of   the cnida.
   In     the ecthoraeum               from chambered cnidae the basal portion
distinctly swollen; thence, becoming attenuated,                                                 on   as      an is
                                                                                   it   runs
excessively slender wire                 of   equal diameter.             Around this basal part
wind one         or      more spiral thickened bands, varying,                      in   different        spe
cies,      their number, the number
          as   to                       volutions made by each, and
                                                              of
the angle which the spiral forms with the axis. The direction                                                 is
from east    north. The spiral armature

  These thickened                 spiral      bands afford insertion               to   a   series   of   fine
setae, which        I      call pterygia.        These are from eight                   to   twelve      in   a
single volution,             and they project            in   a    diagonal direction from the
ecthoraeum,   but often become reverted.      some cases, perhaps   In                                     in
all, the strebla and the pterygia are continued beyond the swollen
portion        of

     2.   Tangled         cnidae (Cnidae glomíferae).                This sort differs from the
preceding chiefly            in   the uniform slenderness                of   the ecthoraeum, which
lies coiled up more               or   less regularly     in   the cnida, without any                 cham
ber.      Corynactis viridis affords excellent examples for observation.
     3.   Spiral cnidae (C. cochleatae). The walls     the tentacles,         of                          in
                                                                                                          a
few species,              contain very elongated fusiform                      cnidae,      which     seem

                                          127
composed        of a slender thread coiled up in        a very close and regular
spiral, bearing a resemblance to the shell of                  a Cerithium.               The
ecthoraeum is discharged           reluctantly,     and the wall of the cnida is
very subtile.
  4. Globate         cnidae (Cnidae globatae)?        These are globose vesicles
found in the acontium of S. parasitica, which have some characters
in common with the cnidae, but of whose real nature   am doubtful.      I
   In    the indubitable      cnidae the emission     of the   ecthoraeum          is a   pro
cess    of eversion.       This is proved by many circumstances, such                        as
the order in which the portions are evolved, the basal portion first;
as well as by direct observation, the terminal part               of the         ecthoraeum
being occasionally detected in running out through the centre of the
portion already evolved.
   The    cnidae      are filled with a fluid, which holds organic corpuscles
in suspension, and          these are seen driven     rapidly through the ectho
raeum in the process of eversion. I conclude that in this fluid resides
the expansile force, which, on the excitement of a suitable stimulus,
distends and projects the tubular portion of the wall that has hitherto
been inverted.
   All    of the four kinds of       cnidae enumerated have been at various
times     seen surrounded       by a membranous investiture, which                  I   distin
guish     as   the peribola.     This   coat must be ruptured before the cnida
can emit the ecthoraeum.
   Several experiments show that the ecthoraeum                       has the power          of
penetrating          the tissues of other creatures, and even of the Verte
brata.         In   some of these experiments shavings of human cuticle,
presented for an instant to the tentacles of B. crassicornis, and to
the acontium of S. parasitica, were found on examination to                                  be
pierced through with numerous cnidae.
   Experiments with blue vegetable juices were instituted,                              with a
 view to test the acid or alkaline properties              of the poisonous fluid
 supposed to be ejected on the discharge of the ecthoraeum; but with
 no definite result. The existence of such a poisonous fluid is in
 ferred, however, with a degree of probability amounting to moral
 certainty, and that of such concentrated power                 as,   under certain        cir
 cumstances,         to   destroy life with great rapidity,        even      in   vertebrate
 animals.
    Admitting         the existence     of   a   venomous fluid,      it    is   difficult    to

                                   128
 determine where it is lodged, and how it is injected.       I incline to
 the hypothesis,   that the cavity of the ecthorreum in its primal in
verted condition, while it yet remains coiled up in the cnida, is
occupied with the poisonous <U+FB02>uid, and that it is poured out gradu
ally, within the tissues of the victim, as the evolving tip of the wire
penetrates farther and farther into the wound.
   The paper is illustrated by <U+FB01>gures of the organs described.

“An     Account of some recent Researches        near Cairo, undertaken

                                (Abstract.)
   In   the <U+FB01>rst part   of this Memoir, read on the 8th of February,
 1855, and published in Part I. of the Transactions of that year, the
author states the main object of the inquiry to have been, to endea
vour, by probing the alluvial land in appropriate places, to discover
the probable    time that has elapsed since the lowest layer      of Nile
sediment was deposited, and thus to connect geological and historical
time.    This object, in the opinion of the author, can only be at
tained by means of shafts and borings of the soil in the immediate
neighbourhood     of monuments of a known    age.  The places he selected
for these excavations were the vicinity of the Obelisk of Heliopolis,
and the site of ancient Memphis.      The general introductory matter,
and the analyses     of the various soils penetrated, together with a
description  of the researches at Heliopolis, are given in the <U+FB01>rst part
of the memoir ; but the author deferred his general conclusions, and
all inferences as to the secular increase  of the alluvial deposits, until
he should have an opportunity of laying before the Society an account
of the more extensive researches in the district of Memphis.         That

                                          129
  account, together        with the author’s     general conclusions,    form the
   subject  of this second part.
      The practical part of the whole inquiry has been conducted under
  the immediate direction of Hekekyan Bey, an Armenian engineer
  oi<U+FB01>cer in the service of the Viceroy of Egypt; and a brief biogra
  phical account of him is given, showing his eminent scienti<U+FB01>c quali
  <U+FB01>cations for such researches.          The author had the advantage of ob
  taining the zealous cooperation of our Consul-General in Egypt, the
  Honourable Charles Augustus Murray, and his successor, the Honour
  able Frederick Bruce,          on whose    representations    the late Viceroy
  Abbas Pacha, and the present, not only             gave a ready assent to the
  undertaking,      but, with a rare'and most exemplary liberality, ordered
  that the whole expense should be defrayed by the Egyptian Govern
  ment.
     As at Heliopolis the Obelisk         is all that remains above ground of
  that city,    so,   at Memphis, there is one solitary         monument     of its
 former     greatness, a fallen      colossal statue of     the  great king Ra
 messes    II.,  the Sesostris of the Greeks.          All testimony appears to
 concur    in assigning the foundation of Memphis to Menes, the <U+FB01>rst
 king of the <U+FB01>rst dynasty, who, according to Lepsius, began his reign
 3892 years      13.0.   The   same   authority assigns the dates of 1394 to
  1328 a.(:. for the reign of Ramesses II.            The site of Memphis pre
 sented therefore a peculiarly <U+FB01>t situation for prosecuting the inquiry,
 by sinking pits to the greatest practicable            depth near this colossal
 statue, and around it.
     The surface of the ground, for some distance around the statue,
 being uneven, it became necessary, in order toascertain the variable
 depth    of water during an inundation,           at the mouths     of the pits,
intended to be sunk in various parts of the area, that the level of the
highest rise of the water over the ground at a given time should be
determined. This was done for the inundation of 1851, and it proved
to be somewhat above the 24th cubit mark of the Rhoda Nilometer,
a   height of water which covers the entire surface of the valley, leaving
above it arti<U+FB01>cial elevations.           The inequalities of the ground are
such, that in any section, under the 24th cubit level, the surface
varies from where        it coincides with that level to nearly    20 feet in the
deepest part;        so that, while   in one part of the district there might
be a depth      of nearly 20    feet of turbid water, in another it might be

                                          130
less than an       inch; and consequently, the      same period   of time would
be represented by very different degrees          of thickness of the sediment.
    Two pits were sunk close to the fallen colossal statue, sections of
both of which are given.           In the deepest, the shaft was continued to
the depth of 24 feet        5  inches, when further progress was stopped by
<U+FB01>ltration water.         This interruption to excavations occurred in every
other pit that was sunk.            From the bottom of the shaft, a boring
tool was applied, and cores of soil were brought             up from successive
depths, the lowest being 41 feet           4% inches from the surface of the
ground.        The sections given of the two pits in this locality show, that
the soil consists of varieties of loam and sand in irregularly alternating
layers   ;   and the Nile sediment from the lowest part of the boring was
found, by a careful analysis, to be nearly identical             in composition
with that deposited by the inundation of the present day. At a
depth of 5 feet 8 inches from the surface of the ground they came
upon the upper surface of the platform              on which   the colossus had
 stood, consisting       of two courses of cyclopean masonry, together
 5 feet    6  inches thick, resting on an arti<U+FB01>cial bed of sand, the sand
resting on Nile sediment.            Throughout the excavation various ob
jects of art and some bones          of domestic animals were met with, and
 the boring instrument brought up from the lowest_depth a fragment
 of pottery.
    The author next proceeds to describe, with references to detailed
 sections, seventeen pits and borings sunk in the area of Memphis,
 and also a series of seven pits opened in ground below the inundation
level of 1851, in a line across the valley from the foot of the Libyan
 Hills  on the west       of the Nile, to the skirt of the Arabian Hills on
 the east of the river, embraced within an area of about <U+FB01>ve miles
 from west to east, and a mile from north to south.
    In 1854 another       series  of pits and borings were sunk in the parallel
 of Heliopolis,       above   eight miles above the apex of the Delta, in
 ground below the inundation            level of 1853, which was very nearly
 the same       as   that of 1851, the .line including <U+FB01>fty-one pits in a
 distance of about sixteen miles, eight miles on the right, and eight
 miles on the left bank of the river;         two of them near the river were
 carried to a depth of 50 feet, and one to a depth of 60 feet from the
 surface of the ground.       _  This last reached   to within  7% inches of the
 mean level      of the Mediterranean.

    The author    then reviews the chief facts made known                 by the
 ninety-<U+FB01>ve   probings of the alluvial land         above described, and gives
 the following results   :
     1. That the alluvium consists of two principal kinds, viz. an argil
 laeeous earth or loam more or less mixed with <U+FB01>ne sand, and of
 quartzose sand, which is probably brought from the adjacent deserts
 by violent winds   ;
    2. That the Nile sediment found            at the lowest depth reached is
 very similar in composition to that of the present day;
    3. That in no instance did the boring instrument strike upon the
 solid rock, which may be presumed to form the basin between the
 Libyan and Arabian Hills, containing              the alluvium accumulated
 through unknown ages ;                      .
    -1. That, except minute organisms discoverable only by            a powerful
 microscope,   few organic     remains were found,          and those met with
 were recent land shells and bones of domestic animals ;
    5. That there has not been found a trace of an extinct               organic
 body   ;
    6. That at the same level great varieties in the alluvinm have
been found in adjoining pits, even when the distances between them
 were very moderate    ;
    7. That there is an absence        of all lamination        in the sediment.
 The author points out the       causes that account       for this,—chie<U+FB02>y the
 rapid drying of the soil, so soon as the inundation water has sub
 sided, the operations of agriculture, and the violent winds that sweep
                                                                           T
over the valley forming vast clouds of dust           ;
    8. That in many places the disintegrations              of sun-burnt bricks
have contributed largely to the soil      ;
    9. That in nearly every part of the ground penetrated, arti<U+FB01>cial
substances have been found, such as fragments and particles of burnt
brick and pottery, and      at the lowest depth reached.
    The author then enters,       at some   length,     into the circumstances
which modify the deposition of the sediment in diiferent parts of the
valley, showing how the coarser and heavier matter held in suspen
sion in the inundation     water must be deposited in greatest amount
in the higher parts of the river’s course, in its bed, and near its
banks; that this must be further caused by the slight fall, which
between Assouan and Cairo is less than           6%  inches in a mile, the Nile
                                                                  K 2

in its whole course from the <U+FB01>rst cataract to the sea not being used
as water power          ;    that the vast heat must cause an evaporation that
lets fall the solid matter more abundantly in the southern latitudes;
that    the river from 42 miles                 below the <U+FB01>rst         cataract is nowhere
allowed to over<U+FB02>ow the land, but is con<U+FB01>ned                            by embankments, so
that the waters             of irrigation    are spread by canals, by            which and by
the irregularitiesof the ground eddies are formed.   From all these
causes affecting the distribution of the sediment over the land, the
depth of the annual deposit by the inundation is very different in
different parts         of the valley, and consequently                   the same lapse         of
time may be represented by very different depths of the soil.
   The author next treats of the rate of secular increase of the allu
vial land.           Before entering upon the results at which he arrives by
these recent researches, he refers to the operations                             of the French
engineers at the end                of the last century, who          state the mean         of the
rise   of the land between Assouan and Cairo to                        be 5 inches in a cen
tury.      From that conclusion, and especially from the application of
it,   the author dissents, and states his reasons at considerable length
in the Appendix to his Memoir.                         He considers that in every situa
tion where       a    calculation      is   to be made   of the rate of secular increase,
we must have           a    <U+FB01>xed point in time to start from          ;   that     is,   the known
age     of   a   monument, the foundation                of which rests upon Nile sedi
ment, and upon the sides of which the latter has accumulated by sub
sequent inundations.                 If there    have been no local causes to disturb
the probability that the sediment above and below the foundation

thefoundation by the number of centuries known to have elapsed
from the erection              of the monument to the present time, and then
apply the same chronometric                    scale to the greatest ascertained depth
of sediment below the foundation.                     Estimated by this rule, the re
searches      at Heliopolis gave             the result of   rate of increase of 3'18

Nile; whereby           it    became       doubtful whether      a   bed of sand penetrated
was sedimentary or              a   part    of the desert land.

platform on which the statue had stood, after making a due allow
ance for the foundation                   of the platform having           been below the then

which the        above depth         of sediment         was accumulated         ;   and supposing
that no disturbing                 cause     had interfered         with the normal              rate of
deposition in this locality, and of which there                             is   no evidence, we
have thus       a     mean rate of increase within              a   small fraction of       3%   inches
in   a   century.          Below the platform, there were 32                     feet    of the total
depth penetrated, but the lowest two feet consisted of sand, below
which      possible there may be no true Nile sediment in this loca

posited at the same rate of                   3%   inches in    a    century,    it      gives for the
lowest part deposited an age of 10,285 years before the middle of
the reign of Ramesses               II.,    11,646 years       13.0.,   and 13,500 years before

presumptive           evidence that the whole of the land of Egypt between
the bounding hills, from the <U+FB01>rst cataract to the sea, extending
nearly 700 miles—that land which associated in our minds with all

recent geological period.                   No trace of an extinct organism has                    been

                                   (Abstract .)
     As in my present effort to obtain further light upon some of the
 still obscure points in the physiology of the ear I have been prima
 rily guided by observations made upon my own cars, I should pre
 mise that both are very e<U+FB02>icient for hearing; but that they diifer
 from each other in the important             particular that the faucial ori<U+FB01>ce
 of the right Eustachian tube         closes much less    tightly than that of the
 left, insomuch      that there are times when the former           becomes quite
 patent, with no disposition         to collapse.      Again, having lately been
 troubled for above <U+FB01>ve weeks with a tympanic                deafness,  I carefully
 registered     a series   of auditory phenomena resulting therefrom, and

                      __._‘_~           135
found them exceedingly noteworthy.                Lastly,   I  have made certain
experiments upon the external auditory canals              of the sound    ears.
   I  compare, then, with one another, the phenomena yielded by a
normal ear, an ear with an open Eustachian tube, an ear with the drum
impaired in a particular manner, and an ear whose external meatus is
in  a known altered condition        ; calling in facts from other sources in
aid; and, <U+FB01>nally, endeavour to determine the uses to be assigned
to the several structures        of the drum in order to embrace all the
phenomena*.
    I assure  myself that my Eustachian tubes are ordinarily shut, by
the difficulty (greater for my left one) of forcing the breath into the
drums when       I  stop my mouth and nose, and the hinderment                 to its
escape   till  I  swallow or eructate, showing          that those acts open the
tubes.    If we mark    the sinking-in   of the lachrymal sac when       we swallow
with the mouth and         nose stopped, we may see that the naso-guttural
cavity enlarges as the glottis is closed in that act, producing a partial
vacuum in the drums,           and therefore       from   the greater barometric
pressure a feeling of tightness          upon the membrana tympani, whilst
from loss of usual pressure the Eustachian tubes thereupon close more
<U+FB01>rmly, and the faucial parts swell and stick together.
    I can readily distinguish the act of opening the Eustachian tube
from all other guttural       ones, both by hearing and feeling.          A  tearing
 sound, or an irregular run of clicks, marks a slower, a sharp click a
 quicker opening of the tube,          a  sou<U+FB02>e the rush of air through the
patent tube, and a        small crack the displacement of the membrana
tympani.        I  frequently perceive       these    phenomena in deglutition,
 though, owing to the strong pressure of the current of ejected air in
 the fauces, more especially in eructation.           Sometimes also in yawning,
 showing that      a sundering contraction       of the muscles of the pharynx
 and palate attends the opening of the tube.
    With the tube patent       I  feel the membrana tympani,          as  expiration
and inspiration alternate the greater amount of pressure in its two
 surfaces, oscillating from outwards           to inwards, as the inner canthus
of the    eye,   as reached by the nasal duct, may be              seen to do.     In
 violent explosive       expirations,    the    strength    of   the  membrane      is
   * A note shows,that though I     speak particularly from these sources, the results
rest on much broader grounds;      and mentions how far anything like any portion
of this paper  has been previously published by myself or others.

severely tested; the mildest speaking, coughing, or sneezing even, is
always disagreeably felt thereon.
  But to pass to the attendant sonorous phenomena —the rippling
of the air in the tube at each elevation and depression of the ribs
expresses itself by a souffle, and every word        is taken to the             I utter
labyrinth directly through the tube with a force that proves annoy
ing;—observations which plainly evince why the Eustachians are
usually impervious, and why they almost never open except at that
instant   of deglutition, or of the                       reverse act, eructation,               which occludes
the glottis.
     From numberless observations,                           I am able to affirm             that the faculty
                                       of all                        be by
of audition is not at                           deteriorated                 patency    of   the tubes,       how
ever the ordinary use                           the ear may                  perplexed       by   sounds enter
ing the tube.              Nor     does stretching                the membrana tympani,                   by   aug
menting        or     diminishing the aërial pressure                              on      its   inner surface,
enfeeble hearing.
I     will now turn               to              made upon my left ear when
                                       observations                                                                it
was deafened.          I        show that the external meatus was unaffected; and
if
I     rubbed my finger over the skin covering the bone behind the ear,
or   carried the ticking                of      a   watch     to     the bottom         of   the meatus            by
means     of   a     metallic probe, and then did the like                              to   the other ear,       I
heard well, and             as   well upon one               as   the other.           Hence the labyrinth
and     acoustic       nerve remained                      healthy,          and the drum              alone was
affected.       Singing noises                  in   the head had been developed                    just     to   the
same extent           as   hearing had been blunted,—phenomena                                    that for three
weeks before           an   instantaneous cure remained quite unchanged.
     The noises were             caused          by the circulation              of    the blood about the
drum, for they rose and fell                        as   the circulation was quick                or   otherwise.
And  I    was led          to   the belief that these noises were not created                                by   any
morbid change               of   local circulation,               but that,       by   a   morbid change           in
the acoustic properties                   of     the tympanum, ordinary movements                            of the
blood     thereabouts              were heard               in   a    multiplied manner;                 for the
click and souffle from air entering the Eustachian                                           tube,      as   heard
in   the healthy            ear,    were wonderfully                    magnified          in    the deaf one.
The louder souffle, that      eructation, normally but very weak,
                                                 of
even when the intruding air strongly forces outwards the membrana
tympani,             the deaf ear was always                         very pronounced bruit.                   And
             of in
                                                                 a

site   of the membrane         are described, which,         hardly audible in   a normal
ear, are loud in an ear thus diseased.
     Thus  group of phenomena beckon to the inference, that this
             a
deafness had so modi<U+FB01>ed the acoustic properties of the drum, as both
to render all sonorous vibrations                affecting    the air within it by far
more audible than before, and all those entering                     the meatus audi
torius externus as much less audible than before.                       What physical
cause can bring about these inverse effects?
     1.   If the   fenestra rotunda be the chief portal for sound, no change
at   it could render     one     set   of sounds more audible without doing            so
for the other also.
     2.   If sound   be mainly conveyed to the labyrinth by undulatory
displacements        of the membrana tympani, causing bodily oscillation
of the ossicles, the membrane could not be rendered more responsive
to aerial waves falling upon one side of it without becoming equally
so   for those falling upon its other.
     3.   If the   fenestra rotunda chie<U+FB02>y afford passage to sound, and the
membrana           tympani has acquired            an abnormally        high re<U+FB02>ecting
power,      repelling    vibrations      that     would heretofore       have     escaped
through it from the drum back upon this fenestra, and those that
fall upon its outer surface back through the meatus, effects of an in
verse kind do result.           This hypothesis, therefore, cannot            be rejected
without      a careful consideration.
     Let us inquire, then, what in<U+FB02>uence the existence of                  a membrana
tympani would, under this supposition,                    exert on hearing.      Sonorous
vibrations impressed upon the walls                 of the head, that is, of the      ex
ternal meatus, are heard more loudly when                       we anyhow cover this
canal so as to close       it,   as any cavity when           closed resounds like an
open one of greater size          (J. Miller). In          again testing this principle,
I have used various materials for closing the meatus, have plugged
the entrance, and laid the thing over               it,
                                         and observe always that the
smallest ori<U+FB01>ce in the occluding                body detracts from the resonance;
which    know to occur in the con<U+FB01>ned air, and not in the parietes
          I
                                                                                            '
of the canal, for my deafened car was deaf to it. Such experiments,
however, do not evince that the membrane                        aids hearing     by reso
nance, but the contrary.               Dealing    with vibrations      already existing
in the walls of the cavity insulating the air, they do not at all imi
tate the case of vibrations passing into the tympanum through a

                                                   138
medium,—the              membrane.            As no substance can            be applied over the
meatus, however it be done, which does not hinder our hearing                                    of
external sounds just as much     it occasions resonance of parietal
                                                 as
ones,    the membrane on this supposition must in some degree or
other he a positive detriment to the auditory function.                              Besides, were
hearing aided by resonance within the drum, a patent Eustachian
tube by allowing vibrations to disperse must impair hearing, which
I   know not to be the case.                    Again,    if    we assume the membrane           to
but slightly arrest               the transition       of sound from the outer to the
tympanic air, to be, in short, an unavoidable impediment                                to hearing,
ful<U+FB01>lling         some non-acoustic           purpose, the loss         of it would not prove
at once, as it does, a serious detriment                        to hearing rather       than some
bene<U+FB01>t.           I   may append too, that were it but a tri<U+FB02>ing obstacle, the
group     of sounds occurring within                      it,   so described, should       be aug
mented by resonance in the external                             meatus, on its outlet being
stopped       ;   yet  I   can detect nothing of the sort.                   Further, I   squeezed
a plug of chewed brown paper, and one of dry paper, <U+FB01>rmly into the
bottom of the meatus of the healthy ear, against the membrane, co
vered the membrane with                     a   stratum     of wax, and <U+FB01>lled the meatus
with water         ;    but in not one       of these experiments            were the said   group
of sounds rendered louder.                   So that   it   appears that the application to
the membrane of even                   a   highly re<U+FB02>ecting          surface fails to intercept
and cause             intra-tympanic sounds, which can only be be
                      to return
cause    the membrane   difficult for such sound to pass through. But
                                  is
if   the membrane highly resists the transition                         of aerial vibrations,    it
(the fenestra rotunda being the chief portal)                           is   a   serious detriment
to hearing.   Hence this fenestra cannot be                            of this acoustic conse
quence.           And     we must have recourse to the only other theory                     which
suggests itself, which             is—
  4. That the membrane and ossicles form the essential path for
sonorous vibrations, which traverse    the mode of condensation
                                                       it       by
and rarefaction; that aerial                  upon the outer surface
                                                ones impinging
of the membrane easily impress themselves upon its substance, and pass
into      ossicles, whilst the inner surface presents
        the                                           great obstacle             a
to their escape into the air in the drum, and equally repels vibra
tions that fall upon              it   from this air.           Thus, when disease nulli<U+FB01>es
the great re<U+FB02>ecting qualities                 of the inner surface, much of the sound
from without passes               into the drum and               is   wasted, or deafness re

                                                       139
sults; whilst much of that in the drum enters the membrane, and
some of it finds              its
                    way along the ossicles, and noises the head                                     in
are engendered.
   Now    find that the cutaneous surface
            I                                                               of the drum-head admits
vibrations from air with very much greater facility than water does,
that    is,   readily; for           on   filling the external meatus                    of    the sound ear
with water, and then letting                    itleak out again,           I    remarked that for more
than half       an   hour afterwards septa                     of    water were constantly forming
themselves across the canal and producing much deafness, and then
breaking again with   loud noise, and the deafness vanishing. After
                                    a
some evaporation the following instructive effects alone took place:—
the membrane would attract       film     water over its surface, and
                                                      a          of
deafness ensue; but              air plunging into the drum through
                                      on   a   gust   of
the Eustachian tube, the membrane springing outwards with smart                                               a
smack, would throw off the fluid, and the hearing     instantaneously                    as
 be    restored.       This would gradually wane away again                                              by   the     re
attraction       of   the water,           to    be   instantaneously regained again, and                               so
on.         But since the transition                  is   easy between the membrane's outer
surface and air, what has been said above shows that                                       it    must be           diffi
cult between the inner surface and air, and the statement                                                in    (4.)     is
demonstrated.
   Accordingly the external layer    the membrane    formed of skin,                     is                   of
a dry tissue         of
                loose texture, penetrable   air, and coming into in         by
timate relation with it; whilst the mucous membrane       the drum                                  of
 is,   as
        it    were, unparalleled not only for tenuity, but compactness and
high vascularity, though                    it, it    barely possible            to   verify the presence               of

 midable barrier                    the passage           of            air, and vice

 versá; and this                    so reflected, that the membrane and ossicles lead
 ing    to    the labyrinth               lie   without        it,   confining         useful vibrations                to
 their destined path, and excluding                              hurtful         ones from             it;    and the
                                                                                               of by
 mastoid cells help                 to   further stifle such vibrations                   as           any accident
 intrude upon the air                    in   the drum.          The membrane                          the fenestra
 rotunda,        by    its    elasticity,        protects the acoustic nerve from undue
 compression, &c.               The membrana tympani avails acoustically                                           by   its
 area, whilst         its    flexibility, the joints the ossicular chain, &c., are

 the fenestra ovalis, and provision against mechanical accidents.                                                     The

                                          I40
structure of the labyrinth admits          of explanation,      in a great degree,
upon like principles.
     The personal    of deafness studied in this paper was from a
                        case
cold draught on the ear, a mere inflammation of the mucous lining
of the drum, ultimately forming a layer of dried mucus upon the
membrana          tympani,     which originally involving much air-bubbles,
remained very permeable             by air, and assimilated acoustically       the
inner face of the membrane to the cuticular outer one.                 The instan
taneous dispersion   of the noises and deafness was caused by the
sudden peeling oil‘ of this false cuticle; whilst a <U+FB01>lm of water upon
the cuticular face assimilates that to the inner one, when the ear
excludes both tympanic and outer sounds from the labyrinth.                  Deaf
ness     produced by disease in the external         meatus only yields noises
when it propagates irritation so as to excite secretion              of mucus on
the inner face        of the drum-head.       Simple perforation     of the drum
head only deafens in proportion to the extent                 of surface removed.
If there       co-exist a more or less <U+FB02>uid discharge from the drum, this
spoils hearing        by covering the cuticular surface of the membrane,
though it may not deviate          so much    acoustically    from that lined by
mucous membrane as to very materially              damage it.     To remedy such
deafness       mechanically,    we should <U+FB01>rst essay     to rescue the cuticular
face from the      <U+FB02>uid by placing   some material to draw oil‘ the discharge
from     it,   so as to keep the membrane       <U+FB01>t for its duties, and still   ex
posed to aerial vibrations.          If the   mischief   is   so extensive that we
are obliged to employ some disc to rest against the remaining ossicles
as   a   substitute    for the true membrane,       try to form one
                                                    we should
with surfaces acoustically imitating those of the membrane itself.
  The paper concludes by pointing out how the various injuries which
have been known to occur by disease              or otherwise     to the different
parts of the tympanum,           are readily accounted    for by the functional
hypothesis here submitted.

     yesterday,      I    see some very interesting             experiments         described in        a
     communication           by Dr. Tyndall,          “On      some     Physical Properties          of
     Ice.”       I   write to you to point out that they afford direct ocular
     evidence of my brother’s theory of the plasticity of ice, published in
     the ‘Proceedings of the 7th of May last; and to add, on my own

             a
     the lamellar         structure which Dr. Tyndall has                   hown to be induced
    in ice by pressure, as described in the sixth section of his paper.
       Thus, my brother, in his paper of last May, says, “ If we com
    mence with the consideration of       mass of ice perfectly free from
                                                     a

    and     if
           we suppose     to be kept in an atmosphere at or above 0° Cent.,

    then, as soon as pressure               is   applied to     it,   pores occupied by liquid
    water must instantly be formed in the compressed parts, in accord
    ance with the fundamental                principle of the explanation            I       have pro
    pounded—thc lowering,                  namely,    of the freezing-point           or melting
    point, by pressure, and the fact that ice cannot exist at 0° Cent. under
    a pressure exceeding that               of the atmosphere.”              Dr. Tyndall <U+FB01>nds
    that when        a   cylinder of ice    is   placed between two slabs of box-wood,
    and subjected to gradually increasing pressure,                     a   dim cloudy appear
    ance    is   observed, which he <U+FB01>nds             is   due to the melting         of small por
    tions of the ice in the interior of the mass. The permeation into
    portions of the ice for time clear “ by the water

    from such parts as may be directly subjected to the pressure,” theo
    retically demonstrated by my brother,                      is   beautifully illustrated        by
      VOL.       IX.                                                                 L

Dr. Tyndall’s statement, that “the hazy surfaces produced by the
compression of the mass were observed to be in a state of intense
commotion, which followed closely upon the edge                 of the surface   as it
advanced through the solid.            It  is <U+FB01>nally shown that these surfaces
are due to the liquefaction        of the    ice in planes perpendicular       to the
pressure.”
     There   can be no doubt but that the         “oscillations” in the melting
point of    ice,  and the distinction between strong and weak pieces in
this respect, described by Dr. Tyndall in the second section of his
paper, are consequences of the varying pressures which different por
tions of a mass of ice must experience when portions within it
 become lique<U+FB01>ed.
     The elevation of the melting            temperature     which my brother’s
 theory shows must be produced              by diminishing the pressure         of ice
 below the atmospheric pressure, and to which               I alluded as a subject
 for experimental       illustration,   in the article describing        my experi
 mental demonstration of the lowering effect of pressure (Proceedings,
 Roy. Soc. Edinb. Feb. 1850), demonstrates that a vesicle of water
 cannot form in the interior of a solid of ice except at a temperature
 higher than 0° Cent.          This is a conclusion which Dr. Tyndall ex
  presses  as a result     of mechanical considerations:         thus, “Regarding
  heat as a mode of motion,”          “liberty of liquidity is attained by the
  molecules at the surface of a mass of ice before the molecules at the
  centre of the mass can attain this liberty.”
      The physical theory shows that a removal of the atmospheric
  pressure would raise the melting-point of ice by F’;-6ths of a degree
  Centigrade.       Hence it is certain that the interior of a solid            of ice,
  heated by the condensation           of solar rays by      a lens,  will rise to at
  least that excess of temperature above the super<U+FB01>cial parts.             It appears
  very nearly certain        that cohesion will      prevent the evolution        of   a
   bubble  of vapour of water in     a vesicle   of water forming by this process
   in the interior of a    mass of ice, until a high “ negative pressure” has
   been reached, that is to say,       until cohesion has been called largely
   into operation, especially     if the  water and ice contain little or no air
   by absorption     (just   as water freed from air may be raised consider
   ably above its boiling-point under any non-evanescent                  hydrostatic
   pressure).      Hence it appears nearly         certain that the interior       of  a.
   block of   ice  originally clear, and made to      possess vesicles    of water by

the concentration         of radiant heat, as in the beautiful experiments
described         by Dr. Tyndall in the commencement of his paper, will
rise very considerably in temperature, while the vesicles enlarge under
the continued influence of the heat received by radiation through the
cooler enveloping ice and through the fluid medium (air and a watery
film, or water) touching it                  all    round, which          is      necessarily         at   0°Cent.

        BARLow, Esq. Received January 28, 1858.
    A   Government          Commission               to   Ceylon        in   the beginning             of    1857,
led the author,           as    Chief Engineer                     charge      of      the Expedition,
                                                                                                                     of to
                                                              in
provide (among            other instruments)                    some     aneroids,           as   a   means
saving time        in   ascertaining the levels                 of   the mountain             passes       of   that
Island.          The aneroids offered                by   makers did not appear sufficiently
graduated          to   admit    of   minute observation, and                      at   the author's           sug
gestion      Messrs. Elliott furnished                    a   more complete vernier,                       which,
however, was shown               to   be   susceptible          of   material improvement.
    With these comparatively imperfect instruments,                                          it   was shown
that    an   elevation     of   950 feet may               be   taken        to   correspond with the
fall through the first inch   the aneroid; that about 970 feet more
                                           of
corresponds with the fall through the second inch, and about 1000
feet corresponds          with the fall through the third inch. These altitudes
having been checked                   by   levels taken with the ordinary surveyor's
spirit-level,      it   was shown that this experience corresponds with the
Tables published           by    M. Bellville, within                1   per cent.
    The thermometer, which                  is     usually attached               to   the ameroid,        is   not
a   necessary      adjunct, but       is   frequently useful, and always interesting.
The compensations introduced                        to   provide against variations           L            tempe
                                                                                              2 of

                                       144
rature, as affecting the results given by the instrument,        were shown
to be etfectual without the aid       of the thermometer.
    The di<U+FB02>iculties to     be contended    with in taking accurate observa
tions were shown to be local variation,         diurnal variation, and some
irregularity in the action of the mechanical parts of the instrument
itself.    These difficulties were examined aeriatim, and modes        of ap
proaching      to their corrections were explained.      The modes of com
pensation for variations      of temperature affecting the instrument were
shown as at present practised          by the makers: the diaphragm-box
being compensated by means of the introduction~ of a small portion
 of aériform <U+FB02>uid, instead of being allowed to act with         a perfect va
 cuum, and the metallic connexions          between the diaphragm-box     and
 the index being compensated by compound              arms or connexions    of
 steel and brass so adjusted       as to neutralize  mutually the respective
 contraction     or expansion   of  each at variations  extending to 100 de
 grees   of temperature.
     The mode now practised by makers of graduating the aneroid
 (when thus compensated) by comparison with a standard mercurial
 barometer, was stated, and it was suggested that improvement on this
 practice might be made by reference to standard elevations running
 up to 2000 feet at least in Great Britain.          Practical examples were
 given    of the  use of the instrument in Ceylon, showing the variations
  of the aneroid (when properly checked) to lie between          1 foot and  6
  feet, as compared     with the surveyor’s spirit-level: other examples
  were given of practice on the Great Western, South-Eastern, and
  North Kent Railways, varying from the true levels from 6 inches
  to 6 feet, over distances of between 300 and 400 miles.
     The paper concluded with Tables in the Appendix, and with dia
   grams explanatory of the construction of the instrument; the Tables
   being intended to illustrate     the effects  of diurnal and also of local
   variation within the tropics (in Ceylon), and also in England.

The BAKERIAN      LECTURE was delivered by JoHN P. GAssior,
       Esq., W.P.R.S., “On the Stratifications and Dark Bands
       in Electrical              Discharges              as    observed       in Torricellian             Wa
       cuums.”
   The Lecturer gave an exposition of the substance of a Paper,
communicated by him under the above title, and illustrated his Lec
ture by a repetition, before the Society, of the Experiments described.
The following is          an      abstract:—
  The author refers to the stratified appearance of the electrical                                         dis
charge when taken from the terminals of a Ruhmkorff's                                          induction
coil in the vapour of phosphorus,                              and in highly attenuated gases,
first noticed by Mr. Grove (Phil. Trans. Part I. 1852, and Phil.
Mag, Dec. 1852).      Having witnessed the experiments of Mr.
Grove,    Mr. Gassiot in the                   same year examined the discharge
                                                              in a
barometrical vacuum in which the mercury had been carefully boiled,
but he could not obtain any signs of stratification.                                      These      experi
ments were subsequently repeated by several continental electricians,
whom he names, and who                         all   describe the induction-discharge                      in
                                                                                                            a
barometrical vacuum                  as   intensely white, and filling the whole tube
without stratification.
  After alluding  the experiments
                           to                                  of
                                    the Rev. Dr. Robinson (Proc.
R.I. Acad., Dec. 1856), and     some recent improvements
                                                     to      the                                      in
construction       of    the induction-coil,                   the author proceeds             to   describe
                          of he
apparatus which                   had constructed for the more careful examination
of   the character                the induction-discharge.                     His first experiments
                be on
were made               glass tubes about                  10   inches long,        in   which the     mer
cury could              lowered      or   raised      to   any required level            by   means   of   the
air-pump.        He also experimented with barometrical                                    vacuums         ob
tained    by   inverting       a    tube    of   about          44   inches    in   length, filled     with
boiled mercury, over               a   vessel containing that metal, and then sealing
                         inches above the barometrical height.

  The results obtained                    by   these       methods having been found                       un
satisfactory, the author                                                 that first suggested         by   Mr.
                                                                 by to
                                        had recourse
Welsh (Phil.        Trans. 1856,               p.    507),               which that gentleman              con
structed the large barometer                         at   the Kew Observatory.                  Following

                                                             147
out the principles indicated by      Mr. Welsh, by carefully removing                                                   all
trace    of    moisture, and thoroughly cleaning the tubes before intro
ducing the mercury, the author succeeded                                             obtaining Torricellian
vacuums which exhibit the stratifications                                        in in   a   uniform        and very
marked manner.
  The sealed tubes generally                            used
                                                                   by   Mr. Gassiot          are then described.
They are made                of      the usual glass tubing,                      about           an   inch internal
diameter, and             of   the form fig.                1.

                   f                                         i
They vary from                 10     to     38 inches           in   length.        In      the latter case the
platinum           wires     a  b      are about 32 inches apart.                              One tube           is   de
scribed       5   feet   3   inches          in   length, with wires             4   feet     9   inches apart.
  With        a    tube prepared                   on   Mr. Welsh's principle, and the usual
sized Ruhmkorff's                    induction-coil excited                     by  a    single cell        of   Grove's
nitric acid battery, with                         or   without        a   condenser, the phenomena                      of
the stratified           discharge can                  be   seen       and examined with ease, and
without the trouble and uncertain manipulation                                               of    an   air-pump,       or
the employment                 of    phosphorous                 or   other vapours.
  If    the discharges are made                         in   one direction,              a   black deposit takes
place     on                             the tube nearest the negative terminal.                                   This
                                     in of
               the sides
deposit       is   platinum              a     state    of   minute division emanating from the                               -
wire, which becomes black and rough                                        as  if   corroded.           The minute
particles         of   platinum              are deposited            in   a    lateral direction from the
negative wire, and consequently                               in   a    different manner from what                      is
described          as    occurring            in   the voltaic arc (De               la   Rive's ‘Electricity,’
vol.    ii.   p.   288),      so     that the luminous                    appearance          of   discharge from
the induction-machine                         can      in    no    way arise from the emanation                         of
particles         of   the metal.
  The author describes                                       of   experiments made                     the apparatus

vacuum tube;                         describes the peculiar appearance when the                                    mer

when the mercury                     rose above the negative                      ball, but when the pole

of   a magnet was presented to the positive                                     ball, the stratifications
were drawn to the length                   of two or three inches down the tube.
     In   the sealed tubes the stratified discharge was obtained by                                                       fric
tional electricity; and              if   a charged Leyden                    jar is discharged through
the vacuum by a wet string, the stratifications are as distinct as from
the induction-coil.
  The author next proceeds to show, that by a single disruptive dis
charge of the primary current excited by a single cell, the entire
tube, whatever may be                    its   length,        is   filled with stratifications                           as   far
he asthe dark band near the negative wire; and from this experiment
is        of   opinion that the phenomenon cannot                                    be   in   any way due                     to

contact,    it   only appeared                on    breaking.            If,   however, the intensity                          of
the primary current                 is   increased        by       using ten        or    more cells,             stratifi

primary circuit.               These stratifications                    are always           concave towards
                                                                               on

several electricians                have described and figured the form                                      of   the         dis
charge with the coil. These stratifications appear                                     in   quick succession,
but they         can    always           be    separated           in    any part          of     the tube by                   a
magnet.
      Under certain conditions the positive discharge                                     assumes            a    peculiar
form,      of   which the author gives                   a    drawing.             He considers that this
 exhibits      a   direction        ofa   force from the positive                     to   the negative,                   cen
 tering     to   the axis       of   stratification,           which cannot                be     connected with
 the passage         of   particles, and that the latter phenomenon,                                         as

 in   the voltaic arc, may                be    but the result            of   a   secondary action.
   The author notices the peculiar difference between the positive
 and negative discharge;                                                                            by

                                                                                          or or

 surface        of   mercury, and the negative                       of   a    wire,           the reverse.                    In a
 this apparatus, moreover, the mercury                                  at    one end could              be   elongated
8     or   10   inches.         When the mercury was negative,                                    its   entire surface
 was covered with               a   brilliant glow; when positive, the extreme point

                       __._-n_~      149
of the mercury exhibited intense light, but the remainder of the sur
face appeared unaffected by the discharge.         In order to test whether
any signs of interference could be detected, he had a tube prepared
with four wires, by which discharges could be observed when taken
from' separate coils, as shown in <U+FB01>g. 2, where a b and a' 6' are
platinum wires hermetically       sealed, as  in the previously      described
apparatus.      Care was taken to manipulate with induction-coils       giving
discharges    of equal intensity; but in no     case did any sign     of inter
ference appear.      The discharges, whether in the      same or  in opposite
directions,   mingled; the strati<U+FB01>cations, having a tendency to rotate
round the poles of      a magnet    and obeying the well-known          law  of
magnetic rotations, could be separated by either pole.
    If, instead of scaled wires, tin-foil coatings,   a b (<U+FB01>g. 3),  are placed
 on the vacuum tube, and the coatings are attached to the terminals
 of the induction-apparatus, brilliant strati<U+FB01>cations immediately ap-           ,
 pear in the portion of the vacuum between the coatings, but without
 any dark discharge.       On approaching    a powerful    magnet, the stra
 ti<U+FB01>cations divide into two equal series, in which the bands or strata
 are concave in opposite directions.
    If a vacuum    tube, with or without wires or coatings, is placed on
 the induction-coil, or on the prime conductor      of an electrical machine,
 strati<U+FB01>cations   appear which are divided       by the magnet.        Having
 thus ascertained that there are two distinct forms of the strati<U+FB01>ed
 electrical discharge, the author, for the sake      of clearness of expres
 sion, terms them the direct and the induced discharge.             The direct
 discharge is that which is visible in a vacuum when taken from two
 wires hermetically    sealed therein; this discharge has       a tendency to
 rotate, as a whole, round the poles of a magnet.           The induced dis
 charge is that which is visible in the same vacuum when taken from
 two metallic    coatings attached to the outside of the tube, or from
  one coating and one    wire; this discharge     is divided by the magnet,

                                       150
 and the two divisions      have a tendency to rotate in opposite        direc
 tions.     The character of    these two forms   of electrical discharge can
 always be determined by the magnet.
    The author concludes his paper in the following words :—“ I refrain
 for the present from any observations as to the action of the magnet
 on the discharge.        The intimate relation of magnetic and electric
action has long since been shown; but the curious effect of the
power    of a magnet to draw out the strati<U+FB01>cations from the positive
 terminal, and in some instances its powerful action on that portion of
 the discharge which exhibits the phosphorescent           light in its great
 est intensity,    are worthy of further examination.        In the preceding
 experiments my object was directed to the examination of the stra
 ti<U+FB01>ed and of the dark band discharge ; at present I am inclined to
 the opinion that the strati<U+FB01>cations in the positive, and the dark band
 between it and the negative glow, although           apparently similar, are
 eifects arising from distinct causes—the        former   from pulsations     or
 impulses     of  a force  acting   in a  highly   attenuated    but  resisting
 medium, the latter from interference.         I am at this time engaged in
 making      further experiments for the elucidation        of this novel and
 remarkable phenomenon."

    These successive           substitutions were accomplished           by the action of

    It   was   long my intention     to extend my researches to the poly

the subject by the beautiful results obtained of late, especially in
France, by the study of the poly-acid alcohols, by the experiments of
M. Berthelot, and more particularly by the classical researches of
M. Wurtz, which enable us to take a general view of this subject.
  Taking as a point of departure the neutral compounds which are
formed     by the action of ammonia upon bibasic and tribasic acids,
the diamides and triamides, derived respectively from                   2   or 3 equivs.
of ammonia, it      became extremely probable that the action               of ammonia
upon poly-acid       alcohols would        give rise to poly-ammonium             bases.
In the conception of this analogy there appeared but little doubt that
ammonia, under the in<U+FB02>uence of the bromides and iodides of bi-acid
alcohols, would       furnish   a series    of bi-ammonium           bases,   exactly as
treatment of ammonia with the analogous compounds of mono-acid
alcohols has given rise to the formation                of the mon-ammonium
bases above referred to.In other words, it was to be expected that
a   compound ether R" Br2 or R" I, (R" representing a bi-atomic
electro-positive radical) would act upon two equivalents of ammonia,

                               About <U+FB01>ve years ago, soon after the
derivatives of bi-acid alcohols.
publication of my experiments upon the action of ammonia upon
bromide and iodide of ethyl, M. Cloéz* obtained a series of bases,
on submitting ammonia to the action of the brominetted Dutch liquid
(C4 H4 Br,).  Two of these bodies he described under the name of
formylia and acetylia, whilst a third body subsequently obtained is
designated by the term propylia-1-.
   To these three bodies M. Cloéz attributes the following formulae :—
                              Formylia........                   C,HaN
                              Acetylia                          C4H5N
                              Propylia........                  C6H7N.
   At    a later period       M. Natanson has studied the action of ammonia
on the chlorinetted Dutch liquid (C4 H4 C1,). This reaction produces
analogous results, but the number of bases is smaller, the chief
product being a chloride, which contains                          a base      either identical or
isomeric with the acetylia of M. Cloéz.
  When carefully considering the results obtained by M. Cloéz, it
appeared to me probable that the bases which he describes, are
in fact the di-ammonium                    compounds            for which      I   was searching.
The constitution assigned by M. Cloéz to his substances is not very
probable.   It is difficult to understand how the action of ammonia
upon a compound like the Dutch liquid can produce simultaneously
three bodies belonging                  to three different         homologous        families, the
formyl-, acetyl-, and propyl-series.                           Our doubts     are,   however, in
creased     if   we    examine into the physical                  characters of these bodies,
especially       if        their high boiling temperatures, and the
                      we consider
diiferences between the boiling-points of the three bases :—

the differencesof the boiling-points of substances, related in the way
that the formulae of M. Cloéz suppose, do not often exceed 20°, and
very rarely rise to 40° and 47°.
  All these difficulties disappear by                             submitting            the formulae        of
M. Cloéz to a slight alteration, and by                          regarding            formylia,       acetylia
and propylia as the di-ammonium                             bases      of the     same series,         of the
ethylene series.            If   we adopt this view, the three bodies are                                  de
rived from 2 of ammonia, in which 2, 4 or 6 equivalents of hydrogen
are replaced respectively by 1, 2 or 3 equivalents of the bi-atomic
molecule ethylene; and the formylia, acetylia and propylia of M.
Cloéz present themselves as monethylene-diamine,                                  diethylene-diamine
and triethylene-diamine.
  I   have endeavoured experimentally to solve this question.                                             The
analysis of acetylia, which is remarkable for the definite character                                        of
its salts, appeared to promise                     an answer to        it.

These numbers appear to me in favour of the formula which I pro
pose for formylia; there remains but little doubt that acetylia and
propylia are analogously constituted.
   There remains yet to find the last term of the                                       series,      the tetre
thylene-diammonium                    compound.               Up to the present moment                   I have
only established by experiment that the three lower bases are
powerfully attacked by bibromide of ethylene, a non-volatile com
pound being produced possessing properties in every respect analo
gous to the character of tetramethyl- and tetrethylammonium.
   If   further experiments confirm                              the   hypothesis            which       I       have
advanced, the action                  of ammonia on bi-bromide of ethylene would
 give rise to four compounds analogous to the bases which                                                I       have

        ()W., with indications of other new Species of Placodus,
        and evidence of the Saurian Nature of that Extinct Genus.”
        By Prof. Rronaan OWEN, F.R.S. &c.                Received February
        6, 1858.
                                  (Abstract.)
     The author premises    a brief sketch of the history of the discovery
 of the fossils referred by Count M<U+FB01>nster, Professors Agassiz, Bronn,
 and Meyer to the Pycnodont family of Ganoid Fishes, under the
generic name of Placoclus; and then            enters upon    the anatomical
 grounds on which he concludes that the Placodus is a Saurian reptile.
 These   are stated to be, principally,-—-l , distinct external bony nostrils,
 divided by an ascending process of the premaxillary, and bounded by
 that bone, the maxillaries and nasals; 2, orbits circumscribed below
 by the superior maxillary and malar bones;            3, temporal   fossae   of
great size and width, bounded externally by two zygomatic              arches,
 the upper formed by the postfrontal and mastoid, the lower formed
 by the malar and squamosal;        4, the tympanic     bone formed by one
 bony piece, with a trochlear lower articular surface; the limitation of
 the teeth to the premaxillary,        maxillary,   palatine,  and pterygoid
 bones, in the upper jaw, with a demonstrated absence            of a median
 vomerine series, such as exists in the true Pycnodonts.           With   these
proofs of the reptilian nature of the Placoeiua, Prof. Owen combines
others exemplifying     its a<U+FB01>inities to the Lacertian order, and more
especially    with that modi<U+FB01>cation       of Lacertia    exempli<U+FB01>ed    by the
extinct genus Simosaurus, from the Muschelkalk.
    The author then describes the dentition of the upper jaw of the
specimen of Placodua,      demonstrating     the foregoing    characters.     It
includes    two premaxillary    and three maxillary teeth, forming           an
outer or marginal series, and two teeth of larger size, forming an inner
or palatal series, the last of which is described as the largest grinding
tooth in proportion to the size of the head, hitherto known in the
animal kingdom.
    From the cranial and dental characters the author deduces the
speci<U+FB01>c distinction of his specimen from previously described Placodi,

   Certain Australian lizards present teeth with large rounded obtuse
crowns, like those of certain Placodi,       and  have on that   account
received the name of Cg/clodua, for their genus.
   The author next proceeds to describe certain specimens of the
mandible or under jaw of the genus Placodus.        The <U+FB01>rst of these he
refers to a species    for which he proposes the name of Placodus
packygnathus.     The second may probably be the lower jaw of the
Placozius Andriani, Ag. ; but should it prove to belong to a different
species,  the term bombidens would best express the speci<U+FB01>c pecu
liarity in the shape of the grinding surface of the teeth. A third
species is named Placoalus bat/tyynathus, in reference to the great
vertical extent of the mandibular    ramus.
   All  the above-described fossils are from the Muschelkalk member
of the triassic   series,  near Bayreuth,     Germany,   and have   been
recently   acquired   for the   Palaeontological  Series in the British
Museum.

    The deposits of mineral matters from natural waters offer many
points of interest to the geologist. Besides the rock-salt and gypsum,
which in many cases have doubtless been formed by the spontaneous
evaporation    of saline waters, it is well known that many mineral
springs charged with carbonic acid under pressure, deposit great
quantities of earthy salts when they come to the surface, and that
the travertines thus formed often constitute extensive     masses.   The

antimony, tin, copper and lead.                   Carbonate       of magnesia is however
wanting, or present only in very small proportion in these deposits,
and the same is true of the calcareous sinter from cold springs. The
Carlsbad water, however, contains for 17 parts of carbonate                                 of lime,
10 parts     of carbonate of magnesia; but this latter salt, according to
Berzelius, is only deposited after evaporation.
  The analyses by Berzelius and Struve of the various carbonated
waters of Germany, show that carbonate of lime is generally present
in much larger quantities than carbonate of magnesia; and it is only
in the waters of Püllma and the Elisenbrunnen                       of Kreuznach, which
contain very little carbonic acid, that we find a large amount                                        of
carbonate of magnesia, with a small portion of carbonate of lime.
The water of Püllna, according to Struve, contains in 1000 parts,
32.72 of solid matters, consisting of sulphates and chlorides of sodium,
magnesium and a little calcium, besides                   10   of carbonate of lime and
‘83 of carbonate of magnesia;               it   contains only T#nths           of    its   volume
of carbonic acid gas.
     In   my analyses    of   the waters    of   the western basin        of   Canada,  I      have
found many brine-springs, which, although rising from Lower Silurian
limestones, hold          no    appreciable amount           of   earthy carbonates, but
contain besides common salt, large quantities                     of   chlorides     of     calcium
and magnesium;           they are     in   fact veritable bitterns.              The mineral
springs     of   these palaeozoic     strata appear       to   be   in   all   cases connected
with undulations producing disruptions                  of   the strata, through which
the subterranean            waters find egress.          In     the almost undisturbed
region    the west, the springs are consequently rare, but
           of                                                                                        the
disturbed country further east, along the north-western limit
                                                                                             of in   the
Green       Mountains, which          are        composed      of   these same palaeozoic
strata     in    an   altered    condition,       the   mineral        waters     become very
abundant.    Five       or   six springs, often differing   kind, may sometimes
                                                                  in
be   found within       a    short distance  along   the same line    fault, but of

                                         161
  where the strata become crystalline, the mineral waters are no longer
  met with.
      In  this eastern region the saline waters issuing from the same
  limestones as the springs just described, are generally more dilute
  than those of the west, and although, like them, containing but very
  little carbonic acid, deposit by boiling or evaporation large quantities
 of earthy    salts, chie<U+FB02>y carbonate    of magnesia.    Many of   these waters
  contain    earthy chlorides,    and are analogous to the Piillna       spring,
 while others, still strongly saline, are alkaline from the presence of
 carbonate of soda. The solubility of the carbonate of magnesia in
 these waters is explained by the observations of H. Rose, who has
 shown that the partial precipitate produced in the cold, by carbonate
 of soda in    a solution  of aneutral salt of magnesia, is redissolved by an
 excess either     of the magnesian salt or the alkaline carbonate, and is
 only thrown down from these solutions by heat. Longchamp has
 further remarked, that the precipitation by heat is rendered less com
 plete in proportion as the carbonate, sulphate or hydrochlorate          of the
 alkali is in   excess, and that the precipitate at   <U+FB01>rst formed under these
 circumstances      is redissolved   on cooling.    I have veri<U+FB01>ed this last
 observation in the case of these natural waters, from which the mag
 nesian carbonate is only separated, when they are evaporated to a
 small volume.        VVhen thus evaporated, even at a very gentle heat,
 these mineral waters yield large quantities         of granular carbonate of
 magnesia, often nearly pure.
      With  these facts   in view, it is very easy to trace a relation between
the saline waters, containing carbonate of magnesia, and another class
of springs in which the predominant element is carbonate of               soda,
with small quantities of common salt, borax and earthy carbonates.
These waters, although         wanting in the west, are very abundant in
eastern Canada, and rise from            the same formations     as the saline
springs, but are most abundant in the argillaceous strata immediately
overlying the lower limestones, which appear to be the source of the
salines.     These alkaline waters probably owe their origin to the slow
decomposition of felspathic débris in presence of earthy carbonates.
By the mingling of these solutions of carbonate of soda with the
bitterns of the limestones, the carbonate of lime would be precipitated,
except so far as an excess       of carbonic acid were present, while car

                                                           162
bonate of magnesia would remain in solution, as in the Carlsbad waters.
The mixture of these alkaline springs with sea-water would yield
similar results.
   From my analyses of more than sixty of the different mineral
springs of Canada, to be found in the published reports of the
Geological Survey,                  I select a few    of each class,
                                                                characteristic waters
giving here only approximatively the determinations of the principal
ingredients for 1000 parts.
        A. Saline waters, containing little or no earthy carbonate.
        B. Alkaline waters, feebly saline.
        C. Saline waters, holding abundance of earthy carbonates.
            a. Neutral, containing earthy chlorides.
                   b. Alkaline, containing carbonate                                  of soda.

 of soda in the above analyses.          Bromine and iodine         are found    in all
 the saline waters.       I  have shown, in my analyses of <U+FB01>ve alkaline
 saline waters from       Caledonia    and Varennes,         that   the amount       of
 carbonic    acid is much less than is required            to form     bicarbonates
 with the    soda, lime and magnesia which these waters contain, so that
 the magnesia must be held dissolved as a mono-carbonate.                       In the
 water of Chambly, on the contrary, there is no de<U+FB01>ciency of carbonic
 acid, and the bases exist as bicarbonates.           The temperatures of these
 springs range from 46° to 53°        F.  ;   some of them are therefore to be
                                                           '
 regarded as slightly thermal.
     Iuterstrati<U+FB01>ed with the shales and sandstones of the Quebec divi
 sion of the Lower Silurian rocks, which immediately overlie the
 strata yielding    these   alkaline  waters, are found thick beds of pure
 limestone,    sometimes presenting         the agatized structure        and semi
 translucency     which characterize        certain   travertines,    but   at   other
 times opaque, homogeneous, and including remains of orthoceratites,
 trilobites and other fossils.      Associated with these beds of pure car
 bonate of lime are others         which     are  magnesian, and contain con
 siderable    quantites   of carbonate of iron, which             causes    them    to
 weather reddish brown.          These beds are always granular in texture,
and contain a variable portion of siliceous sand; they often become
 conglomerate, enclosing pebbles of quartz and schist, or more fre
quently fragments of a pure compact limestone, seemingly identical
with that of the beds just described.            Thin layers of the ferruginous
magnesian rock sometimes separate beds of the pure carbonate of lime,
or form lenticular     masses   in its midst, and     seem to replace its fossils.
The pure limestones also sometimes form the base of                a conglomerate,
or are mixed with sand and argillaceous matters.
    These magnesian rocks, like the pure limestones of this formation,
occur in irregular and interrupted beds; they often attain a thick
ness   of many yards,     are destitute     of fossils, and contain from ten to
forty per cent., and     even more,    of sand or clay. The portion soluble
in acids is sometimes       a  dolomite with carbonate of iron; at other
times the lime is wanting,        or present only in traces,        and we have a
ferrnginous     magnesite.      In   two previous       notes presented        to the
Society,   I  have already explained         the manner in which          I  suppose
these siliceous carbonates to have been, in some parts of the forma

                                      164
tion, transformed    into silicates, such as serpentine, talc, chlorite and
pyroxene, by the subsequent intervention       of heated solutions of alka
line carbonates.
    It appears to me that we may explain the origin of these magne
 sian deposits, by the spontaneous evaporation of magnesian waters.
 If  the waters of Carlsbad were to become stagnant above their de
 posited travertine,   they would yield by evaporation      beds  of ferru
 ginous dolomite,    and waters like those of Caxton, Plantagenet, and
 Sainte-Genevieve    would furnish carbonate      of magnesia nearly free
 from lime.    Nothing forbids us to suppose the existence of waters
 more highly charged than these with magnesian carbonate, formed
 perhaps by the action      of carbonate of soda upon lagoons of        sea
 water, whose lime may be removed as carbonate, or by previous eva
 poration as sulphate.     The lagoons in Bessarabia, supplied with the
 waters of the Black Sea, deposit annually large beds of rock-salt;
and it would require only the intervention of waters like those       of the
natron lakes   of Hungary and Egypt, to produce deposits of magne
 sian carbonate.
    The conditions of   these deposits at  Pointe-Lévis and elsewhere in
the Quebec group, seem to point to the existence        of basins along an
ancient sea-shore, which probably marked the <U+FB01>rst upheaval of the
older Silurian strata.      Beds of travertine were there formed, and
then the sea <U+FB02>owed over these deposits and gave rise to the fossili
ferous limestones;    but there were intervals of disturbance, indicated
by the conglomerates, and these movements, or the deposition         of bars
along the shore, gave rise to lagoons or basins cut off from the sea,
where, by evaporation under the conditions which we have supposed,
magnesian precipitates would        be deposited.   The  absence  of fossils
in these beds is probably connected with the peculiar composition of
the waters.

     The object of the present memoir is the further development of the
 theory of binary quantics ; it should therefore have preceded so much
 of my third memoir, vol. cxlvii. (1857), p. 627, as relates to ter
 nary quadrics and cubics. The paragraphs are numbered continu
 ously with those of the former memoirs.         The <U+FB01>rst three paragraphs,
 Nos. 62 to 64, relate    to quantics  of the general form (*I.z',;1/, . .)"',
 and they are intended to complete the series of de<U+FB01>nitions and expla
-'nations given in Nos. 54 to 61 of my third memoir; Nos. 68 to 71,
 although introduced in reference to binary quantics, relate or may be
 considered as relating      to quantics   of the like general form.     But
  with these exceptions the memoir relates to binary quantics of any
  order whatever : viz. Nos. 65 to 80 relate to the covariants and inva
  riants of the degrees 2, 3, and 4    ;  Nos. 81 and 82   (which  are intro
  duced somewhat parenthetically)        contain the explanation   of  a pro
  cess for the calculation of the invariant called the discriminant; Nos.
  83 to 85 contain the de<U+FB01>nitions of the catalecticant, the lambdaic and
  the canonisant, which are functions        occurring in Prof. Sylvester’s
  theory of the reduction of a binary quantic to its canonical form; and
  Nos. 86 to 91 contain the de<U+FB01>nitions of certain covariants or other
  derivatives connected with Bezout’s abbreviated method of elimina
  tion, due for the most part to Professor Sylvester, and which are
  called Bezoutiants, Cobezoutiants, &c.         I have not in the present
  memoir in any wise considered the theories to which the catalecticant
  &c. and the other covariants and derivatives just referred to relate;
  the design is to point out and precisely de<U+FB01>ne the different covariants
  or other derivatives which have hitherto presented themselves in
  theories relating to binary quantics, and so to complete, as far as may
  be, the explanation of the terminology of this part of the subject.

III. “A    Fifth Memoir upon Quantics.”             By Aivrnua CAYLEY,
            Esq., F.R.S.      Received February       ll,  1858.
                                  (Abstract.)
   The present memoir was originally intended to contain a develop
ment of the theories of the covariants of certain binary quantics, viz.
the quadric, the cubic, and the quartic; but as regards the theories
of the cubic and the quartic, it was found necessary to consider the
ease of two or more quadrics, and I have therefore comprised such
systems of two or more quadrics, and the resulting           theories   of the
harmonic    relation and of involution, in the subject      of the memoir;
and although the theory      of homography or of the anharmonic rela
tion belongs rather to the subject of bipartite        binary quadrics, yet
from its connexion with the theories just referred to, it is also con
sidered in the memoir.      The paragraphs     are numbered continuously
with those of my former memoirs on the subject: Nos. 92 to 95
relate to a single quadric; Nos. 96 to 114 to two or more quadrics,
and the theories above referred to; Nos. 115 to 127 to the cubic, and
Nos.   128 to 145 to the quartic.     The several quantics are considered
as expressed not only in terms of the coefficients, but also in terms
of the roots,—and I consider the question of the detennination of
their linear factors,—a question, in effect, identical with that of the
solution of a quadric, cubic, or biquadratic equation.       The expression
for the linear factor of  a quadric is deduced     from a well-known for
mula; those for the linear factors of     a cubic and a quartic were       <U+FB01>rst
given in my    “Note sur les Covariants d’une fonction quadratique,
cubique ou biquadratique      ii deux indéterminées,”     Crelle, vol.  1. pp.
285 to 287, l855.      It is remarkable    that they are in one point        of
view more simple      than the expression for the linear         factor   of a
quadric.

 generally entertained regarding the formula of the                                         oil   to   be   erroneous.
 Before continuing his experiments,                             he   has therefore reinvestigated the

    The precision obtained by this process is such, that the authors
were able to determine the different conducting powers                                   of the      same
metal, when rolled or cast, as shown above.                              They      were also able to
 appreciate the in<U+FB02>uence of crystallization                       on conductibility, for they
 found that the conducting power of a metal was different when it was
 cast horizontally or vertically, from the different directions which the
 axes  of crystallization took under these circumstances.
    The importance of having the metals as pure as the resources of
 chemistry allow, is shown by the action which                              one    per cent. of im
 purity exerts on the conductibility of a metal, in some cases reducing
 it one-<U+FB01>fth or one-fourth. Copper alloyed with one per cent. of various
 metals gave different conducting powers, in the same manner as                                        Mr.
 Thomson has shown that the conduction                            of electricity by the              same
 metal is affected by a similar amount of impurities.
    Alloying    a metal      with a non-metallic substance also exerts                              an  in
 <U+FB02>uence, as is shown in the case                       of the combination of iron with
  carbon, thus-—

their conducting powers.  The general result obtained              is,
                                                          that alloys
may be classed under the three following heads :—
   lst. Alloys which conduct heat in ratio with the relative equiva
lents    of the metals composing them.
   2nd.    Alloys in which there   is   an excess of equivalents of the worse
conducting metal over the number of equivalents of the better con
ductor, such as alloys composed of lCu and 2Sn      lCu and 3Sn
                                                             ;                   ;
1Cu and 4Sn, &c., and which present the curious and unexpected
result that they conduct heat as   they did not contain
                                        if               particle of

the better conductor; the conducting power of such alloys being the
same as    if   the square bar which was used in the experiments were
entirely composed of the worse conducting metal.
  3rd. Alloys composed of the same metals as the last               class, but   in
which the number of equivalents of the better conducting metal                   is
greater than the number of equivalents of the worse conductor  for         ;
example, alloys composed       of lSn 2Cu; lSn 3Cu; lSn 4Cu, &c.;
in this           alloy has its own arbitrary conducting power, and
           case each
the conductibility of such an alloy gradually increases and tends
towards the conducting      power   of the better conductor of the two
metals composing the alloy.
   Experiments      were also made with bars composed of various metals
soldered together, in order to compare the results obtained with alloys
with those afforded by the     same metals when mixed.
   The <U+FB01>rst part of the paper concludes with the conducting                power
of several commercial brass alloys.
  The second part, which will shortly            be published,   will contain the
conduction of heat by amalgams.

  The consideration of the surface in question was suggested to me

a   quartic function.
     The paper contains            a    preparatory discussion                      of   the curve, and the
surface      is   then discussed          in   a   similar          manner, viz.             by   means       of   the

the surface for the case                in   question.           The equation                of   the surface       is

III.   “ Some Remarks on the Physiological               Action of the Tang
       hinia venenifera.”         By Professors A. KGLLIKBB of Wiirz
       burg, and E. PELIKAN of St. Petersburgh.                 Communicated
       by Sir B. C. Baonm, Bart.             Received March         1,  1858.
   The famous poison-tree of Madagascar            was described for the      <U+FB01>rst
                                                 ‘
time by Aubert du Petit Thouars in his              Genera Madagascarensia,’
under the name of Tanghinia venemfera.               At  a later period,   Sir W.
Hooker published a good description, with          a <U+FB01>gure   of this tree, named
by him Cerbera Tang/tin (see Botanical Magazine, pl. 2968), so that
nothing is wanted with regard to the botanical knowledge of this
plant.     On the other hand, the physiological         effects  of its poisonous
parts have not been hitherto investigated.           All  we know is, that the
fruitof   the Tanghinia is a strong poison, and is used in Madagascar
as an ordeal poison in the most strange and revolting way.                    The
only experiment on animals made by Ollivier, showed that 12 grains
kill a dog in some hours, but this experiment gave no further in
sight into the real action of the Tanghinia.         We hope, therefore, that
the Royal Society will take some         interest in the experiments which         _
we undertook with this poison, of which the following is                  a short.
abstract.
   The poison used by us was the alcoholic extract of the leaves and
small stems of the Tanghinia, prepared from dried specimens, which
Prof. Pelikan had received from Count Seyderitz of Mecklenburg.
About one centigram of this extract was su<U+FB01>icient to show the full
effect of the poison on frogs, when introduced into a wound of the
back.     It  acted also when given by the mouth,            but in this case a
somewhat larger dose was required to produce a full effect.
   The observed symptoms were the following :—
    1. First .of all, viz. in about 5 to 15 minutes, the heart was affected
and stopped in its action, in such a way that the ventricle                became
contracted and very small, whilst the auricles remained dilated, but
were also paralysed.
   2. The voluntary and reflex movements were at <U+FB01>rst not at all
affected ; but some time-from half an hour to one hour—after the
paralysis of the heart, they became weaker and weaker, and gradually
ceased totally without any sign of spasms or tetanus.
    VOL.   II.                                                         N

                                      174
   3.  In the third place the Tanghinia has      a great in<U+FB02>uence upon the
voluntary muscles, which become paralysed.          This action begins very
soon, and we have been       able to show, with the aid of the myogra
phion of Volkman, that      as soon as the heart is paralysed, the muscles
also begin to lose their force.       Nevertheless,  the total paralysis   of
these organs is not observed     till after six hours and more, that is to
say, when the muscles have been preserved in a temperature of 14°
to 16° R.      In a temperature of 4° to 6° R., the irritability of the
poisoned muscles may last for double this time, as is usual with all
poisoned    muscles and nerves; but even in this case it disappears
long before that of the non-a<U+FB01>'ected muscles.
   4.  If muscles   which have lost their irritability through the Tang
hinia are put into a solution of common salt of from -} to l per cent.,
their power of contraction      reappears after a certain time, but only
when they have been        preserved at the lower temperature       of 5° to
6°  R.
   5. Lastly, the nerves also are paralysed by the Tanghinia, and, as
far as we were able to pursue this question, under the same circum
stances as the muscles, only perhaps a little earlier.
   From all this it follows that the Tanghinia is         a paralyzing, and
above all, a muscular poison.        As far as we have been able to   follow
its action, it resembles very much        the Upas Antiar, only its power
would seem to be a little less strong.
   Professor Stokes drew the attention       of the Meeting to some pho
tographic specimens illustrative of the recent researches of M. Niepce
de Saint Victor on “a New Action of Light” (Comptes Rendus,
March    1  and 8).   They were presented to the Society by the author
through Mr. Grove, F.R.S.

    The following communications        were read   :—
 I. “ On Tangential Coordinates.’ J By the Rev. JAMES Boorn,
        LL.D., F.R.S. Received March 20, 1858.
    Many years ago, after I had taken my degree, I was much inter
ested in the study of the original memoirs on reciprocal curves and
curved surfaces, published      in the ‘Annales Mathématiques’ of Ger
gonne, and in the works       of such accomplished geometers as Monge,
Dupin, Poncelet, and Chasles. In the course of my own researches,
it occurred to me that there ought to         be some some     way of express
ing by common algebra the properties of such reciprocal curves and
surfaces, some method which would, on inspection, show the relations
existing between the original and derived surfaces.          I was then  led to
the discovery of a simple method and compact notation from the fol
lowing considerations.      But before     I state them, it is proper to men
 tion that  I published   the discovery in a little tract which      I printed
at the time,   of which the title     was,   ‘On the Application of a New
Analytic Method to the Theory of Curves and Curved Surfaces.’
This little tract, which is now out of print, as only a few copies were
printed, excited but little attention.        Nor is this to be wondered at.
Mathematical researches, and, indeed,           I might  add, scienti<U+FB01>c pur
suits in general, command but small attention in this country, unless
they promise to pay. The obscurity of the author, and the remote
ness   of a provincial  press, still further account for the little notice it
obtained.     Besides, it must in fairness be added, that the materials
were hastily and crudely thrown together; that to save space,               the
demonstrations     were for the most part omitted,         and that the prin
ciples on which the method rests were not so clearly explained as to
enable an ordinary reader,—who had to incorporate                with his own
thinking the notions of another,-to pursue the train of argument, or

the successive steps     of  a  proof with facility and conviction.       This
may to some extent also explain why the method has hitherto received
so little countenance    as not to be admitted into any elementary        work
on the application     of the principles and notation of algebra to the
investigation and discussion of the properties of space.          But the ad
dition of a new method of investigation to those already in use, the
 development of its principles, with illustrations of the mode of its
application,   are surely not of less value to a philosophical apprecia
tion  of what that is in which mathematical knowledge truly consists,
than the giving of problems, which, while they embody no general
principle,  are yet often   di<U+FB01>icult to solve  ;  and when solved, frequently
afford no clue by which the solution          may be rendered available in
other cases.
   The radical vice in mathematical         instruction in-this country and
in our time would       seem    to be, that knowledge       of principles  and
familiarity with methods of investigation are subordinated to nimble
dexterity in the manipulation of symbols, and to cramming the me
mory with long formulae and tabular expressions.
   Again, it often happens that an investigation, which, if pursued by
one method, would prove barren of results or altogether impracticable,
when followed out from a different        point of view and by the help of
another method, not unfrequently leads by a few easy steps to the dis
covery of important     truths, or to the consideration of others under a
novel aspect.     Hence the multiplication       of methods of investigation
tends widely to enlarge the boundaries of science.
   My object in the following paper will         be to show that  problems of
great difficulty, some of which have not hitherto been solved, while
others by the ordinary methods admit only          of complicated and tedious
modes of proof, may by this method be treated with singular brevity
and remarkable simplicity.       I will <U+FB01>rst premise a few simple principles.
   When two <U+FB01>gures in the         same plane,     or more generally in space,
are so related that one is the reciprocal polar of the other, then to
every point in the one corresponds a plane in the other; to every
right line in the one a right line also in the other; to any number of
points in the same right line in the one, as many planes all intersect
ing in the   same  right line in the other; to any number of points in
the same   plane in the one, as many planes all meeting in the same
point in the other.       I might easily proceed to any length with this

                                                          177
enumeration   of the reciprocal properties of curves and curved surfaces.
Hence given a series of points, lines, and planes, we may construct a
series of as many planes, lines, and points, according to a <U+FB01>xed and
simple law.
   Now we know that in the application of algebra to geometry by
the method of coordinates, a point is determined in position by its
projections on three coordinate planes, or by three equations, that is
by three conditions.                   A right    line may in like manner be determined
when we are given the positions                           of two points in it; and                         a plane is
determined by one condition,                          which is called its equation.                                  But
in the inverse method,                     a   point should               be determined                 by one con
dition,          a   right line by two, and                a plane by             three.             Again,     a   right
line may be determined by considering it as joining two <U+FB01>xed points,
or as the common intersection of two <U+FB01>xed planes. Now all these
conditions may be expressed by taking                                     as a new system                  of coordi
nates the segments                  of the common                axes     of coordinates between the
origin and the points in which they                                are met            by    a moveable plane.
Thus           if these      segments be designated by the symbols                                      X, Y, Z, the
three equations which determine a plane are
                         X= constant,           Y= constant,                   Z= constant.
   Again, the equation in (x, y, z) of a plane passing through a point
of which the coordinates are zvyz, and which cuts off from the axes

off segments from the axes of coordinates, having a certain relation
to each other, may be imagined to wrap round or envelope a certain
curve, just as we may see a curve described on paper by the success
ive intersections             of   a series    of straight lines.               Hence there are two
distinct modes according to which we may conceive all curves to be
generated, namely by the motion of a tracing-point, or the successive
intersections         of straight lines; by                  a pencil or   straight    edge, as a     joiner
would say.                These conceptions are the logical basis                      of the methods
by which the principles                  and notation               of common algebra are general
ized from the discussion of the properties of abstract number to those
of pure          space.       The former view gave rise to the method of projective
coordinates, the latter suggests the method of tangential coordinates,
a term          which     I   was the <U+FB01>rst,        I   believe, to invent and apply.
     It     is sometimes very easy to express both                            the projection        and tan

This is the tangential equation of the “surface of centres of curva
ture,” or as it may for brevity be called, the surface of centres.
   This surface in general consists of two             sheets,   one generated by
one centre of curvature, the second sheet by the other centre.                    Let
a perpendicular    P    on a tangent plane to the surface of centres make
the angles A, u, v with the axes of coordinates, then                     P5+ cos A,
Pv=cos u, P = cos          v, and the last equation may be          written

 Now the first member of this equation represents
semidiameter squared

                              of the original ellipsoid, making the angles
X, u, v with the axes, and a cos"A+ b cos’ u + c cos’                 v-P,     is the
square  of the perpendicular on a tangent plane to the ellipsoid parallel
to the tangent plane to the surface of centres.              Hence

Whence we have this remarkable property of the surface of centres:—
   Any two parallel tangent planes being drawn to the surface                       of
centres and to the ellipsoid, the difference          of   the squares     of the  co
incident perpendiculars        let fall upon them from the centre is always
equal to the square       of the coinciding semidiameter of the ellipsoid.
   We may reduce the original equation (6) to the form

By giving to    & a set   of constant values, we might determine the tan
gential equations of the sections made in the plane of ay by the cone
whose vertex is in the axis of 2, and which envelopes the surface of
centres.
   But it will  be better to determine the sections           of the surface made
by the principal planes, and this may be effected by putting                   £, v, ;
successively equal to co and 0. Hence we shall have in the planes

    Hence the sections of the surface of centres in the principal planes
 are two in each; one an ellipse, the other the evolute of an ellipse.
                    On the umbilical lines qf Curvature.
    Among the French mathematicians there has been much difference
 of opinion    as  to the nature      of the lines of curvature which pass
 through the umbilicus of the ellipsoid.             Some hold with Monge and
 Dupin, that the two lines of curvature which everywhere else on the
 surface are at right angles to each other, here merge into one. This
is such a violation     of the law of continuity, that others adhere to the
opinion of Poisson and Leroy, to the effect that at the umbilicus the
radii of curvature     are all equal, and     that there is an in<U+FB01>nite number
of rectangular systems of lines of equal curvature all passing through
the umbilicus.
    An examination of the surface of centres will demonstratively show
that the latter opinion is the correct one.
    For this purpose let a tangent plane to the surface of centres be
drawn through the umbilical normal. Now the projective coordinates
of the umbilicus     are
              d=a»/§:g¢=,                      z<U+FB02>wx/g:g;               ..     um
and the segments of the axes        of .2: and  2   cut oil‘ by the normal are
            2:    A/(62-—c“’)(a’—-c’)

                                        )     a=VW“@W—m.um)   G
Hence the tangential equations of the normal in the plane of we               are
                              2
                            c                             a

Now substituting       these values of      Z and   £ in the equation (9) of the
surface  of centres,   we   shall have for the value of v” the following ex
pression  :
                     [(a’— b’) + (b’-—c’) + (c’—a’)]u”=
                        2     2     2     2       2     2
Hence an in<U+FB01>nite number          of tangent planes may be drawn through
the umbilical normal to the surface of centres.
    The principal sections of the surface of centres in the mean plane,
or in the plane of xz, the plane       of the greatest and least      axe, possess
some very curious properties.

                                       182
   The tangential equations of these sections       are
                   0252+”:   2:(ae_c2)2E2z-2                  '  '   '     ' (13)
                  (a2_b2)2c2E2+(b2_ca)aa:(2=a2c2}'
Now the former of these is the tangential equation of the evolute of
an ellipse, while the other is that of an ellipse whose semiaxes are
the radii   of curvature at the extremities of      a and c    in the planes of
 my and   zy diminished by      a and c.
   It is easy to show, that     if through  the four umbilici of the ellipsoid
normals to the surface be drawn, they will lie in the plane           of 1:, they
will touch the evolute internally and the ellipse externally in the same
points,   so that   the lozenge formed      by the four normals will be in
scribed in the evolute and circumscribed      to the ellipse, and the distance
                                                                       I
of the point of contact to the umbilicus will        be equal to    2    .
                                                                    UL‘
   The respective     areas  of the lozenge, of the inscribed ellipse, and of
the circumscribed      evolute, are connected by relations independent         of
the axes   of the ellipsoid.
   It is in these four points, and in these four points only, that the
two sheets of the surface     of centres touch each other.      We should <U+FB01>nd
on investigation,    that the points of intersection of the sections of the

                                    183
surface   of curvatures in the other principal planes are the      one set
real, while the other are imaginary,    as in the subjoined <U+FB01>gure.
    It may easily be shown,    as in the preceding <U+FB01>gure, that in the
principal planes of the surface of the centres of curvature, the vertices
 of the diameters of the evolute and ellipse are the vertices of the
ellipse and evolute in the adjoining plane.      Thus the semiaxes OX,
 04  of the evolute and ellipse in the plane of XZ.are the semiaxes of
 the ellipse and evolute in the plane of   XY.
    There are many other curious properties of this surface which will
                                                                 '
be developed in the memoir.
    Before passing from this surface,   I would mention    that the funda
 mental property   of the surface of centres suggests   a simple property
 of the evolute of an ellipse.

                                                                      184
        Parallel tangents being drawn to an ellipse and its evolute, and
perpendiculars                       from the centre let                 fall      upon them, the difference                    of
the squares                  of these perpendiculars is equal to the square of the semi
diameter        of the ellipse which coincides with the perpendiculars.
       I   will proceed with a few other applications of the method.                                                        For
example,—
   A surface of the second order touches seven given planes, to find
the locus of its centre.
       Let the tangential equation of the given surface be

and let the twenty-one                                   coordinates        of the           seven     given planes be

successively                  in      the preceding                 equation, we shall have seven                      linear
equations               by          which we may eliminate the six quantities                                    a,   a',   ";
                                                                                                                            a
 £3,     6',   3".      The resulting equation will also                                 be   linear, and      of   the form
                                                 Ly+My,+Nyu-H                   l   =0,
which          is    the equation                    of   a   plane.        Now         y,   y,   and yu,       as   may        be
shown, are the projective                                  coordinates          of      the centre        of   the surface.
Hence the centre                          of    the surface moves along                      a   plane.       When there
are eight planes, we may then eliminate                                            y     or   y,   and the two        result
ing equations will become
                                    Ly+My—l =0,                          L'y+Nyu–1 =0,
or     the centre will move along                               a   right line.
       Again, perpendiculars                              are   let   fall from          n    points
                                                                                                          on
                                                                                                          a     plane, the
sum           of   the squares              of   which        is    constant, the plane will envelope                           an
ellipsoid.
       Should the sums                         of   the squares           be   varied, the successive surfaces
will       all     be   confocal ellipsoids.

of     contact, two             by   two, will subtend right angles                  at   the centre.     The

   My <U+FB01>rst sounding for temperature at any depth, was in 32° 13' N.,
long. 19° 5' W., where at 400 fathoms the minimum temperature
was 5l°'5, the surface at the time being                        70°.       The water brought
up in the bottle was of greater density than we have since found                                    it,
namely, 1031 at temp. of 70°, whilst at the surface      was 1026.                  it
Supposing      that you will         see all the registered depths, &c. sent to
Captain Washington,            I    do not enter into                full detail here.            The
next time, I     sent two thermometers                 down at 500 and 800 fathoms                      ;
at the greater depth,             44°'5; at the lesser, 50° was the minimum
temperature.         But now       I    began to observe some alterations                           in
the indexes      of the instruments,               that of the maximum                          column
not    returning to the surface in the                     same        position in which            it
stood on starting,         viz.    close to the mercury
                                             (brought to the sur
face temperature          by
                   being kept su<U+FB01>iciently long in the water along
side, and then compared with the deck-thermometer     in constant
use for that observation).  Now    know from former experience that
                                             I
these indexes will shift by shaking the instrument, and with much
less   force than    is    frequently       communicated             to   it   by   a
                                                                                        shake   of the
line, on its passing up and down.                  From this           we may       infer that the
minimum index also moves, how much                         it   is   impossible to say.           And
on looking over the results obtained during the voyage,                                 I   <U+FB01>nd that
but few of the maximum indexes have come in standing at the point
they started with.        I    therefore draw your attention to the fact, that
such remedy       may be applied             as   will obviate the defect.                  I     have
found another fault in thermometers before now (but then                                  it   was at   a
low temperature, and not Six’s self-registering instrument                                  that was
employed). During my second winter at Fort Simpson,    every three                  I,
hours throughout twelve of the twenty-four, registered twenty-one
thermometers,        eighteen       of Adie’s and three of Negretti’s, on glass
scales.   I   never found Adie’s at any temperature to differ more than
a   degree and   a   half from each other.                 Negretti’s, when they ranged
low, say twenty           below     zero,   I   have found             twenty,      eighteen,      and

                                                  190
twelve degrees          lower      than Adie's.              Here,    in a high temperature
(eighty degrees),           I   <U+FB01>nd three di<U+FB01>"ering from the deck-thermometer,
as well as from                     (having only six remaining), being
                        the other three
six, seven, and ten degrees higher.    The correction (but a few tenths
of a degree) can be allowed for certainly, but this difference may not
be the same at a lower temperature, therefore it occasions a serious
drawback     to the e<U+FB01>iciency            of these instruments; and                    I    always feel
                                                                                                             ‘
doubtful about the results.              As yet      I   have only used those that agree
nearest with each other.
   My      next       sounding      was in               W., the
                                                   10° 7' N., long.             27° 32'
position of the Hannah Shoal, no bottom with 2000 fathoms of line.
There is 15 marked in some charts on this shoal.     In 4° 16' N.
and 28° 42' W., two thermometers were sent down to 1500 and
1000 fathoms,           the greater depth               showing       a     minimum 39°'4, the
lesser 42°'5.         No specimen of bottom had yet been brought up,                                    as
all the soundings hitherto, except those for the Devil’s Rock in the
Bay of Biscay, as well as the determinations of temperature, had
been taken from a boat with small lines;                                  so   in the next cast          I
sounded from the ship with a large line,—the regular deep-sea line
and combined the experiments.                      Two thermometers were sent down
on the line; and the sinker was down, by intervals, at about 1080
fathoms.      The valve brought in                plentiful supply of bottom, and
                                                    a
the thermometers                showed a     minimum temperature of 38°'5 at the
lowest   depth,        and      46°'2    at 680         fathoms.            This    was    in latitude
2° 20'N., longitude 28° 44' W., 90 miles from Saint Paul’s Island.
The specimen of bottom was a <U+FB01>ne light greyish sand.
   Drawing now to the Equator,                    I determined, if possible,              to get a cast
directly on     it,
               and also the temperatures    accordingly the boat took
                                                               ;
the cast  for bottom, while  from the  ship an endeavour was again
made to combine the experiments.                        It   failed, however,       I     am sorry to
say, resulting in the loss              of   a   large portion        of the line, and two in
struments sent down with it.                     From this     I     felt fully convinced that
the uncertainty         of concluding            when the weight               is   down, from the
intervals,   is   such, that the sounding becomes                         of little value,   as   far   as
the true depth         is   concerned.
   [An extract of Capt. Pullen’s Journal                             is    here given,—showing
the uncertainty of judging by the ‘intervals’ as to the time                                 of reach
ing the bottom, and the consequent liability to pay out too much

                                           191
    line  ;  also the increased strain then occasioned by the friction of the
    under current on the over-long line, and the great risk of the latter
    giving way on being pulled in; and stating the conclusion of the
    writer, that, in order to arrive at true results, soundings for bottom
    and temperature must not be combined.]
        I have before this noticed how irregular the intervals always were
    when getting temperatures,         particularly when more than one ther
    mometer was on the line, but had never thoroughly considered the
    cause, nor the results likely to follow from the increased weight on
    the line; for although the addition of the thermometer (weighing
    about six pounds in the water-bottle) gives rapidity to the descent of
    the weight; its bulk offers great resistance on coming in, consequently
   the line has more tendency to break.              And when it is intended to
4  send down more than one thermometer,             the line must be stopped to
   attach the addition, which at once checks the rapidity              of descent,
   and the line has then to        be let off the reel with more force, impos
   sible to apply equably; and the intervals become so irregular, that
   all certainty of when the sinker is at the bottom is lost, and you feel
   at a loss when to stop.
        From this experience     I think I may    say we have pro<U+FB01>ted, for not
   a single fathom       of line has been lost since, although going double
   the depth      ; once, too, with a fresh breeze with 2380 fathoms of line
   out; and it was with the greatest dit<U+FB01>culty we could get the deck
  engine to reel it in again, and then only by putting all the Watch on
  to assist with their weight. I now began to observe more regularly for
   the temperatures, and with a stouter line than that usual for sound
  ing, kept exclusively for the purpose.          After crossing the Equator,   I
  sent the thermometers down at nearly every tenth parallel, three at a
  time, at twelve, eight, and four hundred fathoms, reserving portions
  of the water brought up to send home for analysis.
       In   latitude   26° 46' S. and longitude       23° 52'  W., nearly mid
  way between where Sir James Ross has sounded without getting
  bottom,      I got  2700 fathoms.      A  single thermometer was sent down
  to this 2700 fathoms depth, secured just above the sinker, and came
  in showing      a minimum    temperature   of 35° F. ; and the bottom brought
  up in the valve was a very <U+FB01>ne brown-coloured            sand.
      In this     case the  common deep-sea line was used, and weighted
  with l20lbs. sinker (Brook’s detaching),          just one-<U+FB01>fth of its break

breaking                  strain, as shown in the American                                 soundings.             One hour
from the time we                            let   go, the intervals showed that the weight was
down.
I               ran the easting down between the parallels                                       of    35° and 38° S.,

several               of  50 and 80 fathoms.                       The first was 1110 fathoms down by

bottom                or    on    its     passage       up    or   down,      I   immediately determined on
getting               another             cast, although             darkness          was coming                 on.         The
weather fortunately                           was calm with very little sea                       on;        so   stationing
a    number               of    lanterns, the lead was                   at   once dropped over the bows,
and             as   satisfactory          a      cast was got           as   could possibly            be   wished,          the
sinker striking bottom                                 by   intervals      at    1120 fathoms, thus proving

1375 fathoms of line, which gave me the <U+FB01>rst idea, that what    had                   I
before thought of the Indian Ocean not being so deep as the Atlantic
was wrong.              Proceeding      northward,     I       passed west      of Cargados
Garazos, Saya de Malha, east   of Seychelles, and crossed the Equa
tor in 58° 20' E.; getting cast miles south of with 2380 fathoms,

   Forty or <U+FB01>fty miles west of the northern part of Cargados, 1400
fathoms of line reached the bottom.      In 14° 41' S., 58° 43' E.,
no bottom           with 1570 fathoms        ;    10° 30'        S., and 58° 52' E., no
bottom       with       1320      fathoms.       At this cast         I    sent down       three
thermometers            at the      1320, 880, and 440;               the minimum       at the
greatest depth 51°'5,                at the centre depth          4l°'5, and at the least
depth 51°'5. The maximum tell-tales at the two least depths came
in all right, but that of the greatest depth had fallen 6°; and
its minimum showing an increasing temperature after passing through
the colder stratum,  quite proof enough of its tell-tale falling down
                               is
too, at least down the column instead of remaining up at what                          it   once
must have been in passing through that stratum, which the tell-tale
of the thermometer at 880 fathorns shows the temperature of.

over   it   nearly   a   mile within its southern point, and having no signs                    of
being on shore,          I   conclude that no such island ever existed in the

fathoms in the Atlantic, further south than this cast, which was near
Rose Galley Rocks.               I   am therefore        inclined to think that this is
about the minimum temperature                      of the great depths of the Ocean,
and that it commences soon after passing 2000 fathoms.

           an   apparently Single Picture                    produces the Stereoscopic
           Illusion.”       By A.           CLAUDET,          Esq.,     F.It.S.        Received
           March 10, 1858.
      In   a former
                                 “ On the Phenomenon
                                          of Relief of the Image
                         paper
formed on the ground glass of the Camera Obscura,” which I com
municated to the Royal Society on the 8th of May 1856, after having
investigated the cause of that extraordinary                       fact and tried to explain
it,
  I        found that the images produced                      separately    by the various
points of the whole aperture of an object-glass are visible only when
the refracted rays are falling on the ground glass in       line nearly          a
coinciding with the optic axes   so that when both eyes are equally
                                             ;
distant from the centre of the ground glass, each eye perceives only
the image refracted in an oblique direction                     on that surface from the
opposite        side    of the object-glass.            Consequently        each side        of an
object-glass, in proportion to its aperture, giving                     a   different perspec
tive of     a   solid placed before         it,   the result    is   an illusion of relief as
conspicuous as when looking naturally at the objects themselves.
      Fromthe consideration of these singular facts, unnoticed before,
I   was     led to think that          it   would be possible to construct                  a   new
Stereoscope, in which looking with both eyes at once on                                a   ground
glass at the point of coalescence of the two images                         of   a   stereoscopic
slide,      each refracted       by   a     separate lens, we could see              it    on that
surface         in the    same    relief which          is    produced      by the common
stereoscope.
      This instrument,          as may be perceived             at once,    isnothing more
than an ordinary camera obscura                         supplied      with two lenses, each
mounted on     sliding frame in order to be able to give them, accord
                   a
ing to the focal distance, the horizontal separation necessary for pro

                                        I95
ducing on the ground glass the coalescence of the images of the two
sides  of  a slide placed before the camera.
    The slide itself being cut in two parts, the two images can also,
moving in a groove, be separated in a horizontal direction, until
they are sufficiently apart to be refracted on the ground glass by
 the two lenses in the most oblique direction consistent with the pro
 duction of a well-de<U+FB01>ned image; for it is to the increased degree of
 obliquity of the refracted rays in falling on the ground glass that is
 due the more effective extinction or evanescence of the image for the
eye whose axis consequently          deviates in a greater degree from the
line of refraction.
    By the   same    principles which produce the phenomenon          of relief
of the image formed on the ground glass of the camera obscura, the
right picture of the slide, being obliquely refracted on the ground
glass by the right lens in a line coinciding with the axis of the left
eye, is visible   only to that   eye ; and the left picture, being refracted
obliquely by the left lens in an opposite direction coinciding with the
right   eye, is  only visible to that   eye.   Consequently  each eye seeing
only   one image, and     that image having its own perspective, the optic
axes have to converge more or less according to the angular separa
 tion of the similar points of the two coincident images;          and by the
 di<U+FB02>'erent degrees     of convergence producing single vision of these
various similar points, we have the sensation of the comparative
distances of the objects represented on the ground glass.
    Before having constructed this new stereoscope and tried its effect,
it would have     been hasty on     my part to pretend that its success was
certain, and for this reason      I took care in my former paper to propose
it  as a mere speculative       idea suggested by the phenomenon         I had
discovered, Without vouching for the result.          Indeed  it was not long
before   I had to congratulate      myself on my caution, when   I found  that,
the truth of my experiments           being questioned and the deductions
from these experiments denied, my proposed stereoscope was declared
impossible, as being founded on principles completely at variance with
the laws    of optics.
    However, these remarks did not shake my conviction, and after
the usual di<U+FB01>iculties,      I have now the satisfaction of being able to
prove that    I  was perfectly right, and that    I had not  been led astray
by any erroneous notion         in my analytic    and synthetic    deductions.

 I  have constructed       the instrument      which    I  propose   to call the
 Stereomonoacope, as it        exhibits  in   perfect   relief  a picture  which
 appears single on the ground glass of the new instrument,                and as
 single as the image of the camera obscura has always been supposed
 to be.
    The instrument, in its present rough state, is undoubtedly very im
 perfect and susceptible of many improvements which time and ex
 perience will suggest.       I present it as the result of a <U+FB01>rst attempt,
 hoping that it will    be found    curious as illustrating a new and inter
 esting   scienti<U+FB01>c  fact and producing an c<U+FB01>'ect quite unexpected in
 optics.

       22, 1858.
    Engaged    for some years in investigations        into the phenomena of
audition,   I have become cognizant       of some facts which     I believe have
hitherto remained unnoticed, and which are certainly not generally
known to physicists and physiologists.
    The <U+FB01>rst of which        I   shall treat is the     restriction of hearing
external sounds     of the  same character     to one car, when the intensity
is moderately, yet decidedly greater in one ear than in the other, the
hearing being limited to that ear into which the sound is poured in
greater intensity.      The sound is heard alternately in one ear and in
the other, as it is conveyed in increasing degrees of intensity, and
hearing is suspended alternately in one ear and in the other, as the
sound is conveyed in lessening degrees of intensity.
    Sound, as is well known,      if applied  to both ears in equal intensity,

                                                          197
is heard in both ears; but                         it will be found, if the intensity in respect
to one ear be moderately                           yet decidedly increased, by bringing the
sounding body nearer that ear than the other, or otherwise, as by the
employment,                 in respect to one ear, of a damper or obstructor of
sound, or in respect     of the other ear, by the employment of some
intensifier, or good collector or conductor of sound, the sound is heard
in that ear only which is favoured and has the advantage of greater
intensity.
  There is little doubt that this law holds with regard to sounds
passing through the air, and carried to the ear in the ordinary
manner, without the aid of any mechanical contrivance, as for                                                      in
stance those of a watch placed in front                                of the face; but                  as the     re
striction         of    hearing to one ear, and                       its   suppression            in    the other,
admit        of   being rendered more obvious                               by    an   apparatus that shall
collect      sound,          prevent         its   diffusion        through the air, and carry                      it
                                      propose             give the results                  experiments made
          an to
direct            the ear,   I                      to                                 of
with              instrument           which   I      have invented for hearing with both
ears respectively, and which,                        as   itis   specially adapted for the auscul
tation    of      differences          in   the sounds          of    different parts             of   the chest,   I
have named the Differential Stethoscope,                                    or   Stethophone.
  The results thus procured will                            be   more satisfactory than those                      ob
tained       by    ordinary audition;                 a    sound will            be    increased
                                                                                                         as

object    is      magnified           by   the microscope, and                   as   both ears are similarly
dealt with,            a    perfect parity            of    conditions will hold                    in   respect    of
both ears.
 The differential stethophone                         (see figure)      is   simply          an   instrument      con
sisting      of   two hearing-tubes,                 or    trumpets,         or       stethoscopes, provided
with collecting-cups and ear-knobs,                             one   for each ear respectively. The
two      tubes are, for convenience, mechanically                                          combined, but may
 be   said   to        be   acoustically separate,              as    care   is       taken that the sound,
once admitted into one tube,                         is   not communicated                   to   the other.      The
tubes are composed                    of   two parts nearly equal                     in   length, one near the
ear-knob, made                of  metal     (C); while the other                 part, near the collecting
cup,   is    made           ofmetal wire (B),     impart flexibility.

for insertion           into the meatus externus.                           The other end              of   the tube,
being intended                   to   collect sound,           is   supplied with            a    hollow cup,       or

receiver       (A)         made of wood, or some such material.                                  The mechanical
construction of this instrument is borrowed from the stethoscope
contrived by Dr. Caman of New York, and intended by      inventor                                          its
for the purpose                 ofhearing with both ears
sounds emanating                     from       one point,             and
collected into one cup.                          The two tubes
are brought                near   together,            a    few inches
in    front      of   the face,        by means              of  a     con
necting-bar           (E), but calculated                   to   prevent
the transmission of sound from one tube to
the other.                 This barwith   is   supplied                      a
joint, which permits the tubes      freely                 to   be
moved,         necessary
                 as   is     applying the      in
knobs         to
           the ears. The two knobs are
kept steadily              in   the ears        by     means         of      an
elastic band           (F)      connecting the two tubes
near the bar, already described.
   The instrument                    being fitted into the
ears,    with the knobs directed upwards,
and the cups being applied equally near

with that ear only which                                connected with the cup placed upon the
watch, and the sensation                       in is                                   so

 beremoved     little further than the other cup,
                      a                                   less favour                  so   as   to   be
ably situated for collecting sound, say one inch from the watch, the
ear connected with                   it   becomes totally unconscious                        of   sound, and the
sensation          of  hearing        is   most unequivocally felt                     in   the ear, and          in   that
ear only, which but                   a   moment before was utterly deaf                              to   it.   If     one

                                                    199
cup be placed upon the middle                       of the watch, and the other on the
edge, the watch            sound is heard in that ear only which is connected
with the cup placed upon the middle.
   These experiments may be thus varied, and the result will in
reality be the same, though apparently more remarkable. The watch,
being held in the air, at the distance of about an inch from one ear,
is heard distinctly beating into that car only; but if the watch be
now connected with the collecting-cup of the tube of the stethophone,
insertedinto the other car, the sound, being greatly magni<U+FB01>ed, is
heard in this ear, and in it only, the ear in which the sound had
been primarily heard being now altogether                               insensible           to    it,   or un
affected by     it   as far as our        consciousness           is   concerned.                 The    sensa
tion of sound         is   transferred from one ear to the other, although the
watch    is   allowed to remain in close proximity to the ear that                                       is   now
deaf to its sound.
    A   watch placed upon or inside the check,                          is   heard to beat in that
ear which       is   nearer   ;   but   if   the opposite ear be connected with                           it   by
means    of one of the arms of the stethophone, or by                             a    common <U+FB02>exible
stethoscope, the watch sound                  is   no longer heard in the ear nearer the
watch, but in the ear further from                       it,   which   is    now in reality brought
into nearer connexion with                it,   by means of the hollow tube.
    Sounds, produced in whatever material,                             are    alike subject to this
law, so far as my experiments have yet been made.
    The medium in which sounds                      are produced does not alter this law.
A   watch ticking, or         a   bell ringing, either in the air or under water,
affords the same results.
    Sounding bodies give the                  same results when covered                      with soft or
hard materials.         A     watch placed          in   one corner          of   a   box,   a    few inches
square, and an inch deep,                is   heard to beat in that arm of the ste
thophone only which               is   near it.       By this         means,      and by successive
movements of the instrument,                       and by attending to degrees                     of inten
sity, the exact position          of the watch may               be    with certainty indicated.
Or this may be eifected by successively excluding                                 those parts which
fail to cause hearing in           one    of the      ears.
  The interposition of body calculated to obstruct the sound at its
                                  a
entrance into one of the cups of the stethophone, causes the sound to
be heard in that car only which        connected with the cup which
                                                     is
remains       free   from     obstruction.            This       admits       of ready proof, by

                                                                200
applying the two cups                            as much as possible equally on the middle                                           of
a watch about an inch above                                     it,      and       by    placing two fingers held
together between one cup and the watch.      When this      done, the                                          is
watch    heard
           is    tick into the ear that remains free from obstruction.

                                         in an
     The removal                    of           obstructing body from one cup, while                                       it       is
allowed         to      remain                  operation with the other, causes sound which
had been equally heard with both ears,                                              to   be   heard      in   that one only
which       is      connected with the cup freed from the obstructing body.
Thus,      if      the fingers    interposed between the watch and the cups
                                               be
held equally over                      it,     and the fingers                 be   separated under one                of        the
                                                 of   atmospheric communication,

placing the tubes                    of    the instrument across                         a   block      of   wood with the

satisfactory and conclusive, although the remarkable sensation                                                                       of

pouring in of sound into the ear is less marked,——a fact sufficiently in
telligible from the diffusion of sound which must take place outside
the car, when the extremity        of the tube is held there, and is not
inserted into the meatus.       It is therefore obvious that the restriction
of hearing to     one car, under the conditions      speci<U+FB01>ed, is not due to
closure of the meatus externus, the cause      of the augmentation of sound
in some experiments of Mr. Wheatstone, to be shortly referred to.
    The remarkable phenomenon of the restriction of hearing to one
ear, above described, seems not to be       without important signi<U+FB01>cation.
It  holds apparently in virtue of a law seemingly established for the
purpose of enabling man and the lower animals to determine the
direction of the same sound, with more accuracy than could be done
had a judgment to be formed between the intensity               of two similar
sensations in the two       cars   respectively.     All  source   of error is
removed by there being only one sensation, although there may be
two    impressions.    This law of a stronger impression in one ear,
rendering us unconscious of a weaker, but similar impression in the
other, has an analogue,      though perhaps an imperfect           one, in the
sense    of touch.    Very strong      impressions    upon one part of the
body     cause  such acute sensations, that minor impressions of the
same kind upon another part are frequently not felt, in fact, produce
 no sensation.
    The only observations bearing upon this law which have been    I
 able to discover, are some by Mr. Wheatstone, in a paper entitled
 “ Experiments     on Audition,”
                                                        ‘
                                    published in the Quarterly Journal of
 Science, Art, and Literature,’ vol. ii. New Series, 1827. These expe
 riments    are intended to show the augmentation         which the sensation
 of autophonic sound, and the sounds of         a tuning-fork applied to the
 head, acquires when the ear is closed, although the perception               of
 external sounds is diminished.         Mr. Wheatstone     shows that a vocal
 sound is heard louder in that car that is closed, say with the <U+FB01>nger,
 than in the other.      He also shows, that the sound of        a  tuning-fork
 placed upon the head is heard louder in that ear which is closed than
 in the other which remains open,         even  though the tuning-fork may
 be brought nearer the open car than the closed one.             These experi
 ments,    Mr. Wheatstone            prove that
                                                  “ sounds immediately com
                             says,
 municated     to the closed meatus externus are very greatly magni

                                                      202
sounds can be communicated                          to act on the cavity in a similar man
ner, they must receive a corresponding                           augmentation.”
     This distinguished philosopher constructed the instrument named
a Microphone, for the purpose of augmenting weak sounds upon this
principle, e. the augmentation
                1'.              of sound by closure of the ears;
and he informs us that                it   “
                                          for hearing sounds when
                                               is   calculated                                        it
is   in immediate contact with sonorous bodies,” and that “ when they
are diffused by their transmission                         through the air, this instrument
will not afford the slightest assistance.”                         This instrument           is   spoken
of in connexion with the augmentation of sound, and not in reference
to the limitation of sound to one ear, or to the comparison of sensa
tions in the two ears.               The remarkable, and, to the uninitiated mind,
the wonderful fact, made known more than thirty years ago by
Mr. Wheatstone, that tuning-fork held upon the head close to an
                                    a
open ear     is       not heard in this ear, but in the opposite ear, provided                        it
be     closed with the <U+FB01>nger,                   or by some         other means, proved              that
sounds communicated                   to the skull were exclusively                    heard      in the
closed car.            Inof the tuning-fork, the fact made known by
                             the case
Mr. Wheatstone      undoubted.is  The rationale of the phenomenon
appears to be this :—The vibrations of the tuning-fork are commu
nicated to the bones of the head, and through them to the cars,
including their bones, cartilages, and contained air                             ;    but in the case
of the closed ear, the vibrations                        are permitted    no egress or escape,
as    in the open ear; reverberations take place, and the consequence
is,   that the sound   not duly moderated; and
                               is                    virtue of the law      in
I    have just enunciated, the sensation                         of sound    is   restricted      to the
closed car.When the tuning-fork, duly sounding,    held in the air,              is
and not connected directly with the head, the closed ear remains
insensible to          it,   and the sound          is   heard exclusively in the open ear.
      Mr. Wheatstone’s              interesting          observation   relates to      a   head-sound
not duly moderated, as in the opposite and open ear, and virtually
more intense, and comes                    within the general law advanced in this
paper, which embraces all sounds, whether internal or external, viz.
that   a   sound       of the      same    character in the presence      of both ears,               if
conveyed by any means to one                        ear, or to the nerve of that ear, more
intensely than to the other,                   is   heard in the more favoured ear only.
     It seems   necessary, in         Mr. Wheatstone’s experiments, that the bones
of the head shall vibrate freely; weak sounds, such                                  as gentle blow

                                                203
ing, will not succeed; and if the tuning-fork be placed immediately
under the open ear, and passed upon the soft parts, little <U+FB01>tted for
vibration, between the mastoid process of the temporal bone and the
lower jaw, the sound is heard in this ear, and not in the closed car.
  It    may perhaps            be well, before proceeding          further, to acknow
ledge that       I
            am well aware it has been long known that a very loud
sound conveyed into one ear will render the other ear insensible to
sound     of     a weak              But the phenomenon which I
                           or low character.
have ventured to bring under the consideration of the Royal Society
differs from this well-known and readily admitted fact in this im
portant particular, that no very great loudness is required, and that
no very great augmentation of sound in one car over that in the
other is necessary in order to restrict the     of hearing to one ear,
                                                           sense
and to deprive the less favoured ear of the sense of hearing which it
had previously enjoyed.    A moderate, yet a decided increase of in
tensity is all that is required to remove the sense of hearing from the
less favoured ear, and to cause the more favoured organ to be alone
sensible to the sound.
  When sound is proceeding into the two ears, but in consequence
of its reaching one ear in greater intensity than the other is heard
only in one ear, the sensation of hearing in the favoured ear, though
strictly limited to        it,   is   augmented by the sound entering                  the less
favoured ear, although            it   entirely fails to cause     a   sensation there, or
to produce       a   consciousness      of sound in that organ.           The more sound
collected by the less favoured ear, as long as the amount                        is   less    than
that conveyed to the other ear, the more the sensation                           of sound          is
augmented in the more favoured ear.                     The intensity of sensation in
the more favoured ear increases in               a    ratio with the increase of sound
in the    less    favoured ear, until the intensity of sound               is   the same, or
nearly the same, in both ears, when the sensation experienced                                is   the
ordinary one of hearing with two cars.
  This fact admits of satisfactory proof in this way :-—A watch
                                                                                                   is is
placed on        a                             The stethophone
                     table equidistant from both ears.‘
applied to the ears; one cup   placed within an inch of the watch,
                                           is
while the other      turned away from
                          is              at the distance of some
                                                          it,
inches.    As the further cup            is   brought nearer and nearer the watch,
the sound,       always con<U+FB01>ned to the more favoured               ear,   is   gradually and
steadily intensi<U+FB01>ed, until the two cups are, or are about to be, similarly

                                           204
placed, at which moment the sensation ceases to be restricted to one
ear, and has acquired         its greatest intensity.      This fact proves, that
though the sensation of hearing be con<U+FB01>ned to the ear to which sound
is communicated with greater intensity, we pro<U+FB01>t by the sound which
is conveyed into the other car, though failing to produce a sensation
or a consciousness of sound there, by its serving to augment very
materially     the sensation of sound in the more favoured ear.                The
less favoured       ear thus augments the sensation         which   we experience,
 at the same        time that    it fails to interfere with the aid which the
 sensation con<U+FB01>ned to one ear affords us as to the direction of external
 sounds.
    The sounds of which          we have been treating as differently affecting
 the two cars, according to the intensity with which they are respect
 ively communicated,         are  of the   same    character, though differing    in
 intensity.      It is sounds of the same character only which exhibit the
 phenomenon of restriction in virtue of moderately different intensity.
 The sounds must          emanate     from the same sounding         body, or from
 bodies sounding similarly.           A little difference in character will cause
 the experiment of restriction to fail.
    Thus,   if  two bells, differing considerably       in character,   be rung re
 spectively in the two cars, one louder and graver than the other, the
 louder and graver sound does not render the other ear insensible to
 the weaker sound of the weaker bell.               Both  ears hear perfectly,   but
 the loud, grave sound is heard in one ear, and the weak sound is
 heard in the other.
    If, instead of one watch,        we place two together, having sounds          of
 different character, as for instance          one low and grave, and another
 loud and sharp, and the two arms of the stethophone                be placed over
 them respectively,        the sounds      of both watches     are  heard. but the
 sound of one is heard in one ear, and the sound             of the other is heard
 in the other car.         The loudness of the sound in           one ear does   not
 increase the weakness of the sound in the other;              or, in other words,
 the intensity     of the sensation produced by the weak watch-in the one
 ear is not reduced by the sensation produced by the loud watch in
 the other ear.
    The sound of        a watch    ticking continues to     be heard    in one   ear,
 although    a large-sized bell is made to        ring at the other   ;  and I have
 not perceived that the sensation produced                by the watch     is at  all

                                           205
impaired by the bell.         A whistling      lung-sound    heard in one ear, is
not rendered less obvious by a loud blowing lung-sound                 in the other.
A hissing murmur         at the apex of the heart conveyed into one ear,
and a rasping sound at the base conveyed into the other, are both
heard without alteration        in the     ears   to which they are respectively
conveyed.
    By virtue of these two laws,—1st, that sounds of the                  same cha
racter are restricted       to that ear into which they are conveyed in
greater     intensity,  and 2nd, that sounds differing          in character may
be heard      at the same time in the two cars respectively, even             if they
be made to reach the ears        in different     degrees of intensity,—it is pos
sible to analyse a compound           sound, or one composed        of two sounds,
and to divide it into its component parts.              In  order to effect a divi
sion   of   a compound     sound,     it is only necessary that the two sounds
of which it is composed may respectively               be heard at certain points,
in greater and lesser intensity, and that the respective cups of the
stethophone be placed at these points.                The ear connected with the
cup placed where one half of the sound is in greater intensity, hears
that half sound only, and the ear connected with the cup placed
where the other half of the sound is in greater intensity, hears that
half sound only.         The sound is divided into two parts, and one is
heard in one ear,      and the other part in the other ear.           For example,
 a compound       sound composed          of the two sounds of two watches
placed     together    upon a table, with the unassisted ear is distinctly
 heard    in its compound         state,    and     cannot   be divided     into   its
 two constituent parts.        \Vith the stethophone this is readily done.
 One   cup, is placed where the sound of one watch is in greater in
 tensity, and the other is placed where the sound of the other watch
is in greater intensity, and the result is obtained of one watch only
 ticking in     one ear, and   of the other watch only ticking in the other
 ear.   The greater intensity of each watch-sound in one ear has ren
 dered all hearing of it in the other ear impossible, and as each watch
 sound in its greater intensity is conveyed to different ears,
                                                                               one is
 heard in one ear only, while the other is heard in the other car
 only.     Without the stethophone,            or   some   such   instrument,     this
 analysis could not be made         ;   the ordinary stethoscope will not suc
 ceed,  for wherever it is placed it conveys the mixed or compound
 sound    to the ear.      If the naked ear be applied           over or upon the

                                            206
watches, the same result follows            ;    and   it is the     same    if instead       of two
arms  of the stethophone we employ only one.                                This remarkable
                                                                           e<U+FB02>‘ected also          when
separation of the components of a sound may
                                            be
the sounding bodies are enclosed in a box capable of transmitting
sound, or when separated from us by the interposition of materials
                                                  trials and comparisons
capable of conducting sound ; and by successive
of intensity at different places, and by a process of exclusion of those
                          sensation, the respective positions of two
parts which fail to cause
adjacent sounding bodies may be predicated.
                                             If, for example, we have
two watches,         A   and B, enclosed in a box, and through one cup,                                A,
    we hear watch        A, and with the other cup, B,               we hear watch             B, we
    may conclude that cup A is nearer watch
                                             A than cup B    and so on.            is,
    In the same manner we may auscultate the morbid sounds of the heart.
    By cup A, placed at the      apex,_
                                          and cup      B      placed at the base, we hear
    separately the morbid sounds of the two parts; for example, blow                          a
    ing murmur at the apex in one ear, and      rasping murmur at the
                                                               a
    base    in the other ear.    This     we are enabled to do, although                      at any
    intermediate      point with the single            ear,    either      with or without a
    stethoscope, we hear the conjoined two sounds.   It     obvious that      is
    with the stethophone  we  not only succeed in separating sound, but
    that this instrument, or some similar contrivance, a<U+FB02>'ords the only
    possible means of hearing, with two ears at once, sounds emanating
    from the      same region   or surface, for the sides               of the head can be
    applied,      of course, to the     same      sounding         surface only in turn or
    succession.      With this instrument         we, as      it   were,    place our ears             in
    our hands, apply them where we choose, and listen with them both
    at adjacent or distant points of the same surface, at one and the
    same instant     of time.
       It   is   not unlikely that the property which the stethophone                                 p05
    sesses    of pointing out with precision where sound                     is    most intense,
    may be very usefully employed.                It   seems possible that
                                                                might be             it

the inconvenience         of moving the head, or the ordinary stetho
scope, from place to place, the extent of the respiratory sounds
in different parts, so that a very minute difference, an excess in one
part or a deficiency in another, may with certainty be discovered.
Differences in quality, such as softness or roughness, are readily
recognized.       The increased length and loudness in one part is accu
rately contrasted with the healthy conditions of another part.                    In
cases where the inspiration          has been very  full in one place, in order
to compensate for deficiency in another place, and where the expira
tion was long and coarse in the deficient part, I have heard the in
spiratory sound only in one ear, and the expiratory sound in the
other ear.     The sounds were respectively restricted to the two parts,
and they alternated in a very marked             manner.      One part has re
mained silent while the other has been heard to             sound,      and this has
been silenced when the other has awoke the ear.

    The influence which the acts of respiration exert in heightening
and lowering the murmurs in veins, say of the neck, in persons
affected with a thin and watery condition of blood, is well exhibited
by placing one arm of the stethophone on the chest and the other
 upon the veins.
    When the respiration in two parts is alike in character, but                 de
 cidedly louder in one part than in another, the sound in the weak side
 is lost.   While this loss proves, in      a very emphatic        manner, the   im
 portant fact of deficiency,      it of course for the time deprives us of the
 opportunity of judging of the quality of the deficient inspiration; but
 this is readily obviated by removing the cup of the instrument from
 the full respiring part, and then the deficient respiration is immediately

heard through the other cup.                      Thus while the two sounds, being
of like character, and one being more intense than the other, can
be heard only in one car at the same                       time, an admirable opportu
nity is obtained for contrasting the extent, and some of the qualities,
of the sounds of the two parts, by placing the cups alternately and
rapidly upon the two spots respectively.  Vocal extussive resonance
in two parts of the thorax, is well contrasted with the two tubes
employed at once, or in immediate succession.
   The sounds of the two sides of the heart, and of the valves of the
two great arteries proceeding from that organ, are, by means of the
stethophone,         very advantageously               dealt with.   By placing it over
the two sides of the heart, or the origin of the two arteries, we ascer
tain the character and loudness of the sounds of these parts.       One
cup being placed over the aorta, and the other over the pulmonary
artery,    if   the sounds they collect differ in character, one sound is
heard in one ear, and another in the other car.                      We may have at the
same moment               an aortic       murmur and    healthy pulmonary artery
                                                           a
sound, one sound in one ear,               and another sound in the other car. But
when it
         is desired to listen to each sound singly and in succession,
the instrument will still be available, for the cups may be applied
singly and in succession, thus affording ample means for contrast.
   In cases of disordered heart, in which it is desired to discover
whether the sounds                 of the two sides of the heart are synchronous, the
stethophone          affords the most satisfactory mode of investigating                   the
fact.     With      it,  virtually place our two cars over the two sides of the
                          we
heart; and       if   one side sounds at all after the other, the fact   made         is
known, and the end of                  one sound    and the beginning of another are
clearly and distinctly de<U+FB01>ned.                  With the ordinary stethoscope this          is
impossible      ;   for where         one sound   is   heard, the other may be inaudible,
and long before the head or stethoscope can possibly be adjusted at
another part, the second sound has taken place, and                      is   long since over.
   In     conclusion,      I       may perhaps be permitted          to say, that the      dif
ferential stethophone proves                a   great auxiliary in examining the heart
with the cardioscope or sphygmoscope, which had the honour to        I
exhibit to this Society two years ago. While the latter instrument
exhibits the movements of the heart, the stethophone informs us                             of
their sound,              in   a   more   complete manner        than can be otherwise
effected;       and from the stethophone permitting                  of auscultating two

                                       209
 parts at once, and with the eyes directed to the chest, the relation of
 the movements        and  of the sounds, normal or abnormal, of this most
 important organ is very fully and satisfactorily         made out.
                 POSTSCRIPT.        Received   April 22, 1858.
    In connexion with that part of          my paper which treats of the re
 striction of hearing to the closed ear,       I  desire to add the fact which
 I have    ascertained within the last few days, that      if one ear be closed
 wholly or partially at its external part, i.    e. at the meatus externus,    by
 disease   or by congenital malformation, while the other car is healthy,
 the sound      of the tuning-fork, applied to any part of the head, is
 heard only in the closed car.          This fact holds, although the closed
                                                                                  \
 ear is  totally unaffected by sounds conveyed through the external air.
    I have further to mention the fact, that all persons, deaf in one ear,
 whom     I have   lately examined, with one exception, hear the sound of
 the tuning-fork applied       to the head in that ear only that is deaf to
 external    sounds.      A  man who has been totally deaf in one ear for
thirty years, in consequence of a violent blow upon the head, had the
tuning-fork applied over the forehead.            He started, and said that he
heard only in the car which had been deaf during that long course of
time.     In such   cases I have  been disposed to believe that, amidst other
lesions    of the organ of hearing, there may        be present an obstruction
or closure, that a reverberation      takes place, and that thus a restriction
of hearing is secured for the diseased organ.
II. “On        the Strati<U+FB01>cation of Vesicular Ice by Pressure.”               By
        Professor      WILLIAM THOMSON, F.R.S.                In   a  Letter to
        Professor Sroxas, Sec. R.S.           Received    April 3, 1858.
    In  my last letter to you I pointed out that my brother’s theory of
the effect of pressure in lowering the freezing-point of water, affords
a  perfect explanation of various remarkable phenomena involving
the internal melting of ice, described by Professor Tyndall in the
Number of the ‘Proceedings’             which has just been published.          I
wish now to show that the strati<U+FB01>cation of vesicular ice by pressure
observed on a large scale in glaciers, and the lamination            of clear ice
described     by Dr. Tyndall       as   produced    in hand specimens by        a
                                                                 Q 2

Brahmah’s press,         are    also    demonstrable         as    conclusions       from        the
same theory.
  Conceive a continuous mass                 of ice, with vesicles containing either
air or water distributed          through          it;   and let this mass be pressed
together by opposing           forces on two opposite sides                of it.    The vesi
cles will gradually become arranged in strata perpendicular                                to the
lines of pressure, because         of       the melting     of    ice in the localities           of
greatest pressure and the regelation                 of   the water in the localities             of
least pressure, in the neighbourhood                 of groups of these        cavities.     For,
any two vesicles nearly in the direction                     of the condensation will
alford to the ice between them a relief from pressure, and will occa
sion an aggravated pressure in the ice round each of them in the
places farthest out from the line joining their centres;                             while       the
pressure in the ice on the far sides                of the two vesicles will          be some
what diminished        from what it would be were their cavities <U+FB01>lled up
with the solid, although          not nearly as much diminished                      as   it is in
the ice between the two.               Hence, as demonstrated              by my brother’s
theory and my own experiment, the melting temperature of the ice
round each vesicle will          be highest on its side nearest to the other
vesicle,    and lowest in the localities                 on the     whole      farthest      from
the line joining the centres.                 Therefore,     ice    will melt from these
last-mentioned       localities, and,        if
                                  each vesicle have water in                               it,   the
partition between the two will thicken by freezing on each side                              of it.
Any two vesicles, on the other hand, which                        are nearly    in   a   line per
pendicular to the direction of pressure will agree                    in   leaving an aggra
vated pressure to be borne by the solid between them, and will each
direct» away some of the pressure from the portions of the solid next
itself on the two sides farthest from the plane through the centres,
perpendicular to the line of pressure.  This will give rise to an in
crease     of pressure   on the whole             in the solid all round the two cavi
ties, and nearly in the plane perpendicular                  to the pressure, although
nowhere else so much as in the part between them.                                Hence these
two vesicles will gradually extend towards one another by the melt
ing of the intervening ice, and              each    will become <U+FB02>attened in towards
the plane through the centres perpendicular to the direction of press
ure, by the freezing       of water on the parts of the bounding surface
farthest from this plane.              It   may be similarly shown that two vesi
cles in    a   line oblique to that of condensation will give rise to such

                                                 211
variations         of pressure in the solid in their neighbourhood,                 as to make
them,      by melting and freezing, to extend, each obliquely towards the
        from the parts of its boundary most remote from a plane
other and
midway between them, perpendicular to the direction of pressure.
     The general tendency clearly is for the vesicles to become <U+FB02>attened
and arranged   in layers, in planes perpendicular to the direction of
the pressure from without.
   It is clear that the same general tendency must be experienced
even      when there are bubbles of air in the vesicles, although no doubt
the      resultant effect would be to some extent in<U+FB02>uenced by the run
ning down of water to the lowest part                   of each cavity.
     I        will be found that these principles afford a satisfactory
         believe it
physical explanation of the origin of that beautiful veined structure
which Professor Forbes              has shown to be an essential organic pro
perty      of glaciers.        Thus the <U+FB01>rst effect of pressure not equal in all
directions,         on a mass    of snow, ought to       be, according to the theory,
to   convert it into                of layers of alternately clear and
                             a strati<U+FB01>ed mass
vesicular ice, perpendicular to the direction of maximum pressure.
In his remarks “ On the Conversion of the Névé into Ice *,” Pro
fessor Forbes says,
                             “ that the conversion into ice is simultaneous”
(and      in   a   particular case referred to “identical ”) “ with the forma
tion     of    the blue bands ;.     . . .   and that these bands are formed where
the pressure is most intense, and where the differential                       motion    of the
parts is a maximum, that              is,    near the walls   of   a   glacier.”    He farther
states, that, after long doubt, he feels satis<U+FB01>ed that the conversion                        of
snow into ice         is   due to the effects    of pressure on the loose and porous
structure          of the former; and he formally abandons the notion that
the blue veins are due to the freezing of in<U+FB01>ltrated water, or to any
other cause than the kneading action                   of pressure.         All    the observa
tions he describes seem to be in most complete accordance with the
theory indicated above.    Thus, in the thirteenth letter, he says,
“ the blue veins are formed where the pressure    most intense and     is
the differential motion           of the parts     a   maximum.”
  Now the theory not only requires pressure, but requires difference
of pressure in different direction to explain the strati<U+FB01>cation of the
vesicles.‘ Difference of pressure in different directions produces the
“ di<U+FB02>'erential motion” referred to by Professor Forbes.       Further,

the difference of pressure in different directions                 must be continued
until   a very                  amount of this differential            motion, or dis
               considerable
tortion, has taken place, to produce any sensible degree of strati<U+FB01>ca
tion in the vesicles.     The absolute amount of distortion experienced
by any portion of the viscous mass is therefore an index of the per
sistence of the differential pressure, by the continued action of which
the blue veins are induced.       Hence also we see why blue veins are not
formed in any mass, ever so deep,      of snow resting in a hollow or corner.
     As to the direction in which the blue veins appear to lie, they
must, according    to the theory, be something                 intermediate     between
the surfaces perpendicular       to the greatest pressure, and the surfaces
of sliding; since they will commence being formed exactly perpen
dicular to the direction of greatest pressure, and will, by the differ
ential motion accompanying          their formation, become gradually laid
out more and more nearly parallel to the sides             of the channel through
which the glacier is forced.       This circumstance, along with the com
paratively weak mechanical         condition    of the white strata (vesicular
layers between the blue strata), must,         I think,   make these white strata
become ultimately, in reality, the surfaces             of “ sliding” or of “ tear
ing,” or of chief differential        motion,      as     according      to Professor
Forbes’s observations they seem to be.    His <U+FB01>rst statement on the
subject, made as early as 1842, that
                                     “ the blue veins seem to be per
pendicular to the lines of maximum pressure,”                   is,
                                                    however, more in
accordance with their mechanical  origin, according to the theory                    I
now suggest, than the supposition that they are caused by the tear
ing action which    found to take place along them when formed.
                     is
It   appears to me, therefore, that        Dr. Tyndall’s conclusion, that the
vesicular strati<U+FB01>cation    is   produced    by pressure in surfaces perpendi
cular to the directions    of maximum pressure,           is   correct as regards the
mechanical origin       of the veined structure; while there              seems every
reason, both from observation and from mechanical theory, to accept
the view given by Professor Forbes of their function in glacial motion.
     The mechanical theory    I    have indicated as the explanation of the
veined structure  of glacial ice   especially applicable to account for

by    my     brother’s   theory,  published in     the      Proceedings         for
May 1857.
    I believe  the theory  I have given above contains the true explanation
of one   remarkable fact observed by Dr. Tyndall in connexion with the
beautiful     set of phenomena which he discovered to          be produced      by
radiant heat, concentrated       on an internal portion of a mass of clear
ice   by  a. lens; the fact, namely, that the planes in which the             vesi
cles extend      are generally parallel to the sides when the mass          of ice
                                                                          “
operated on is a <U+FB02>at slab; for the solid will yield to the                  nega
tive”    internal   pressure  due  to the  contractility of   the  melting ice,
most   easily in the direction perpendicular to the sides. The so-called
negative pressure is therefore least, or which is the same thing, the
positive pressure is greatest in this direction.        Hence the vesicles of
melted ice, or       of vapour caused by the contraction of melted ice,
must, as     I have   shown, tend to place themselves parallel to the sides
of the slab.
    The divisions of the vesicular layers into leaves like six-petaled
<U+FB02>owers is a phenomenon which does not seem to me as yet so easily
explained; but_I cannot see that any of the phenomena described by
Dr. Tyndall can be considered as having been proved to be due to
ice   having mechanical properties of a uniaxal crystal.

     By the author’s request, observations were made at               9  A.M.,    ll
 A.M., and from noon every <U+FB01>fteen minutes up to              2*‘ 16'“,  at 3 P.M.,

4 !'.M.,  5  P.M., and   9  P.1v1.,  and these observations, consisting       of
the “Temperature in shade,” “ Wet-Bulb Thermometer in shade,”
 “                                             “ Temperature in sunshine,”
   Temperature on grass in sunshine,”
 “Amount of cloud and direction of wind,” have             been   arranged    in
Tables according to their distance from the annular              path.    The
 observations were made at the following stations        ;—
    Somerton, Towcester, Isham, Peakirk, on the central line         ; Teign
mouth, Little Bridy, and Bicester,         within   10 miles of the central
line; Exeter, Gloucester, Grantham, and Belvoir Castle, within 25
miles  ;  Truro,    Guernsey,      Helston,   Aldershott,   Berkhampstead,
 Hereford, Royston, Norwich, and High<U+FB01>eld House, within 50 miles ;
London, Tottenham, Ventnor, and Southampton, within 75 miles;
 Uck<U+FB01>eld, Leeds, Scarborough,         Wake<U+FB01>eld, Hawarden, Old Traiiord,
and Chorlton, within 100 miles; and Hastings, Fairlight, Lampeter,
North Shields, Silloth, Liverpool, Stonyhurst, Durham, Edinburgh,
Culloden, Isle of Man, Aberdeen, Orkney, Armagh, Belfast, Utrecht,
and Vienna, above 100 miles from the central line.          Readings    of the
barometer and extra remarks are appended at the close of the Tables.
    The differences between the sun-thermometers in the air and on the
grass are not so marked as might be expected, for it happens that            in
March and October their readings nearly approach each other.                In
winter the temperature in sunshine on the grass is considerably below
that in the air, whilst in summer this conditi.on is reversed. The dry
bulb thermometer fell at the middle of the eclipse from       2 to 4 degrees,
the average being about     2-} degrees; to this, however, must be added
an extra amount, on account of the time of day at which the eclipse
took place; had there beentno eclipse, the temperature would neces
sarily have risen.    The wet-bulb thermometer         did not fall quite so
much, as the air became more charged with water at the centre               of
the eclipse, the result of the phenomenon.           Thermometers     in sun
shine (even where overcast) fell twice as much as those in shade.
   At the majority of stations the early morning was exceedingly
<U+FB01>ne, and the sky almost free        of clouds, yet before the eclipse com
menced the sky became overcast and continued so.            It seemed quite
evident that the clouds were formed in situ.           Durham, Edinburgh,
Scarborough,    Uck<U+FB01>eld, London, Norwich, Southampton, Royston,
Leicester, Belvoir Castle, Little Bridy, Isham, and Guernsey, were
all places in which the weather previous to the eclipse had been more

                                    215
or less free  of clouds, and yet all were enveloped by cloud before
noon.
    The following features were very apparent :—The wind, although
brisk before and during the progress of the eclipse, considerably
moderated at the time of greatest obscuration, becoming brisk again
afterwards.     The darkness, although felt, was by no means so great
 as had been expected ; yet this was in a great measure owing to the
overcast sky. The pupil of the eye was not contracted by strong light,
consequently    it was able to take in the diminished light over a larger
surface, diminishing the effect of darkness to our senses. Practically
it was dark ; the impossibility of reading the instruments at Isham,
Towcester, and Grantham, was a certain measure.       I have seen  greater
apparent    darkness   produced   by a storm,  and yet the darkness was
not such as to prevent instruments     being read.  The contracted land
scape was    well shown at Isham and High<U+FB01>eld House.         The change
in the colour of the landscape was almost universally remarked, as
well as the great stillness    at the time  of greatest obscuration.      A
solar halo occurred in the Orkney Islands during the time of greatest
obscuration.      Rooks everywhere returned to their rookeries; fowls
prepared    to go to roost; peafowl actually went to roost ; turkies
hastened home; cooks crowed; sparrows appeared frightened          ;  song
 birds sang as in early morning,    and kept up their song all afternoon.
 Bees returned to their hives. Cows seemed to have imagined that milk
 ing-time had arrived.     The crocus and hepatica closed their <U+FB02>owers.
 An effect on  sea animals was not observable ; the  Actinia crassicornis,
which always expands in the evening, did not open during the eclipse.
II. “ On     the Structure and Functions of the Hairs of the Crus
       tacea.”   By CAMPBELL DE Moaorm, Esq. Communicated
       by Gsoaon BUsK, Esq.          Received March 13, 1858.
                                  (Abstract)
    The object of this communication is to determine, by the observa
tion of their anatomical relations, the uses of the hairs and similar
appendages to the shell of the Crustacea.       The author mentions the
observations of those who have of late specially investigated this sub
ject.    M. Lavalle   noticed the connexion at times of the canals   of the

                                            216
hairs with canals penetrating              the whole thickness    of the shell, and
the occasional continuity   of the matter which <U+FB01>lled the hairs with
that which exists in the corresponding canal of the shell. M. Hollard
says that the canals of the shell which correspond to the hairs, are
occupied by membranous investments, which embrace the base of the
hairs, and seem to receive an extension of the nutrient system.   He
suggests that amongst other functions, the hairs may possibly be con
nected with that of general sensibility.             Dr. Hiickel in        a recent   pub
lication has shown that the canals of the shell and hair                   are   lined by a
continuation   of the outer layer of the soft internal integument, which
he calls the chitinogenous layer.            He describes minutely the structure
of the inner integument, and his account on the whole                        agrees   with
that given by Milne-Edwards ; but he does not recognize the presence
in the canals, of any of the elements of the inner integument except
the external cuticular or chitinogenous              layer; nor the connexion           of
these canals with the         corium         which lies beneath        it,       and which
receives abundantly      nerves and vessels.
_ According to the investigations of the author,   with this deeper,
                                                            it   is
vascular and nervous layer that the contents of the hair-canals and
of the corresponding canals in the shell are especially connected.
This can be readily seen in parts where the shell thin, as in the foot
                                                            is
jaws for example.    In section made in such situation, the canals
                            a                               a
leading to the hairs will be found to he often nearly as large as the
bases of the hairs to which they correspond. They are lined by a
thick membrane, which invests the cup-shaped cavity in which the
hairs are implanted,     and becomes so closely connected with the bulb
of the hair itself, that    it   is   often dragged out with          it   when the hair
is   pulled out.   The cells and other elements of the deeper layer
of the internal integument <U+FB01>ll up the canal and pass on into the
                                  '
hairs.
     Where the shell   is   thick,    as   in the claw of   a   lobster, the sheaths
which    are connected   with the hair-bulbs and line the shell-canals can
be demonstrated   in the manner adopted by Mr. Tomes to show the
existence of the dentinal <U+FB01>bres. If section of part of the shell of
                                               a            a
the claw where the hairs are implanted, and which has been previously
softened in dilute acid, be torn through, the sheaths will usually be
dragged out, and will be seen projecting from the torn edges, their
contents often remaining         in them.         The connexion of the inner in

                                                          217
tegument with these sheaths may be seen in sections                                         of the claw with
the integument still adhering to                          it,   when    on   carefully tearing away the
latter,    its   prolongations             into the sheaths will               be     dragged out.                     That
the hairs have some especial and important                                   connexion with the inner
vascular and nervous layer                      of   the integument            of   the lobster's claw and
elsewhere, seems probable from the observations made                                                by    the author
 on   the contents         of   the claw.         The terminal moveable piece, the pollex,
and the prolongation                  of    the metatarsus which                  it   opposes, the index,
 do   not contain muscular fibre, but are filled entirely                                     by    a     soft pulpy
mass      of    corium.          The nerves               of    the limb are large, but only some
                                                           go
small branches will                  be   found   to      to     the muscles; the principal nerves
pass      on   and terminate    the pulp which fills the opposing pieces
                                           in                                                                               of
the claw.           The author believes that      the office of the hairs to
                                                                  it    is

                                by                                 of                       on is

 In the smaller claw the edges are sharp, and have fine tubercles
along their margin; and the hairs are placed     regular series                       in
                                                                                      a                                     of
 short tufts          on   each side         of   the tubercles, beyond which they                                 do   not
 project.        But       on   the larger crushing claw, the tubercles are massive,
 and no hairs are seen projecting above the surface.    however,                                    If,                     a

                                                                                  means        abun       of
 dant series        of canals which terminate                    in   bulbous extremities, sometimes
 projecting beyond the surface, sometimes lodged                                       in   depressions
                                                                                                                   in in

 shell.        This arrangement may                        be   found    in   other parts; and                             the
 crab's        claw, where the tubercles are deficient, these hairless                                                 pulp
 cavities almost entirely replace the hairs.
    Here, then, lodged within the densest part   the shell,                       of                       is  a     struc
 ture richly supplied with nerves, shut off from other parts                                                      of       the
 body, and having communication with the surface only through the
 medium          of
           canals, which are sometimes continued into short bristles,
 and sometimes terminate                        in   mere bulbs.             As   a   prehensile organ, the
 claw needs sensibility, but                         no   force which the animal could exercise
 could make any impression                            on   the parts within, through                           its     dense
 tuberculated            edges.           On the other hand,             it   is    difficult        to   assign any
 office     to    the bristles,             and still more              to   the bulbs, mechanical                          or

  The author had satisfied himself, before the appearance                                                  of     Dr.

                                                                   In
and even         in    the claws    in    these animals, he found that the structures
within the shell were arranged   the form   tubes corresponding
                                                      in                    of                                      to
the hairs, through which passed from the deeper parts, fibres which
were prolonged into the hair-canals.        the claw the nerve was     In

            to                                                some                                       in
instances merged internally into the general mass                                 of       the corium;              in
others they were truncated.                      Externally,          or   towards the margins, they
presented open orifices, through which the fibres passed.                                        The fibres,
when drawn out from the hair-canals, often presented the plumose                                                    or
serrated character, according      the form      hair towhich they          of             to
belonged.  They could                     be

and    at   times completely through                         them, but their deep connexions
could not        be    clearly made out.               Several modifications           of       this arrange
ment are described and figured.                             The author believes that the facts
brought forward are sufficient                        to   establish that the hairs             of   the   Crus
tacea are probably             organs           by    which external impressions are                          com

  In    Bunsen’s admirable method                           of   gas analysis,    considerable                time
and trouble are expended                           observing the exact temperature and
                                              is in
pressure   which the gas                          subjected        at    measurement; of
               in to
                                                              the time
and also   calculating from these data the volume which the gas
would occupy    the normal temperature and pressure.

excellent           apparatus,         on the other hand, protects                      the gas from the
in<U+FB02>uence            of variations            _of   atmospheric           pressure,     and, under favour
able      conditions, even from the in<U+FB02>uence of change of temperature;
but the complication                   of this apparatus, and its liability to derange
ment, seem likely somewhat to limit its use.
     If, when fall of temperature takes place, we could diminish the
                     a
pressure on the gas exactly in proportion to the diminution of elas
ticity which    undergoes, such fall of temperature would evidently
                        it
not alter the volume                    of    gas       in the eudiometer.             In like    manner   a
rise      of temperature might,                    if   known, be counteracted by lowering the
eudiometer-tube.                      The    same remarks               apply to variations of barome
tric pressure;               as    an increase               of this in<U+FB02>uence might          be    counter
balanced            by raising the eudiometer, and                            a   diminution by depress
ing    it.
     It   is      therefore       a   question          of some interest to <U+FB01>nd, for any atmo
spheric temperature                    and pressure, at what height                    of the eudiometer
the enclosed gas will occupy the same volume as at the normal tem
perature and pressure.                        This      is   easily found by introducing           a   stand
ard quantity             of air into        a      tube over mercury,             marking off the height
of the mercury in the tube at the normal temperature and pressure;
then, at any other temperature or pressure, raising                                      or lowering     the
tube      in the mercurial trough                       so as exactly to          bring the enclosed air
to    its normal volume.                     The mercurial pressure needed for this pur
pose      is      evidently the         same           as that     needed under the same circum
stances           for the reduction of any quantity of                        gas to the volume        which
it   would occupy at the normal temperature and pressure.
     The apparatus We use in applying this principle to gas analysis
(<U+FB01>g.         1)    consists  of the ordinary Bunsen’s eudiometer,
                                  essentially
and a
             “ pressure-tube,” which
                                 simply tube of some     or inches
                                                         is               a                  6     7
 inlength, and about the diameter of an ordinary eudiometer.   It                                          is
closed at one end, and to the other   <U+FB01>xed   smaller tube of about is         a
the same length.     Such    quantity of air   introduced into this
                                                   a                              is
 pressure-tube,              that when in the trough the mercury
                                                   it   is   inverted
stands at convenient height in the narrow tube.
                    a                              At this point                                             a
mark    made, which indicates the height of mercury needed at any
             is
 temperature             or pressure to reduce the enclosed air to its original
 volume.                   trough which we have used differs only
                     The mercurial
 from the ordinary one in being provided with well at one end, thus               a


                                        221
  enabling the operator to raise or depress the eudiometer at pleasure,
  so as  always to bring the gas which it contains to the                  same pressure
  as  the air in the pressure-tube.             Both the eudiometer and the
  pressure-tube    are held in a perpendicular                   position by means of
  clamps which slide on upright rods.                 Each clamp is provided with
  a simple kind of slow movement, by which the tube can be raised or
  lowered   by the operator whilst he is looking through a horizontal
  telescope at a suitable distance. We place the pressure-tube in front
  of the eudiometer,   and by means         of the <U+FB01>ne adjustment              bring the
  column    of mercury in the small tube exactly to the normal mark.
  The eudiometer is then adjusted, also by means of the slow move
  ment, so that the top of its meniscus (as seen through the horizontal
  telescope) exactly coincides with the top of the meniscus in the
'
  pressure-tube.    This is easily done; for the diameter of the pressure
  tube is considerably smaller than that of the eudiometer, and the
  meniscus in the latter can be clearly seen on both sides of the me
  niscus  in the pressure-tube.
     By this method we      are able to obtain             very accurate results with
  considerably less trouble than by Bunsen’s method, and also without
  having any calculations     to perform.            The following analyses made
  during very stormy weather, of air deprived of its carbonic acid by
  potash, gave results amongst which the greatest difference was only
  four hundredths    of a per cent. ('04).

IV. “ On     the Theory of Internal Resistance and Internal Fric
       tion in Fluids ; and on the Theories of Sound and of Aus
       cultation.”     By Roamvr Moon, Esq., M.A., late Fellow of
       Queen’s College, Cambridge.                Communicated by ARTHUR
       CAYLEY, Esq.         Received      April 3, 1858.
                                  (Abstract.)
   The   author shows    in  the <U+FB01>rst   instance, that when sound is propa
gated along a cylindrical tube <U+FB01>lled with air, the compression which
takes place in any element calls forth a resistance which diminishes
the velocity  of the particles in the element, at the            same   time that
the dilatation which takes place in any element calls into            playa force
which will tend to increase the velocity of the particles in the                ele
ment.     He considers that the amount of the force thus called into
play (whether it be accelerative of, or retarding the motion) in an
element of given magnitude in a given inde<U+FB01>nitely short interval,
will depend solely on the amount of compression or dilatation deve
loped in the element in the interval, and the state of density in the
element at the time;       and he is thus led to the conclusion,           that to
the ordinary equation for the transmission of sound through a column
of air must be added      a term   of the form

the conclusion, that in order to represent the effect of internal                                                          fric

the author next shows that          if the  initial disturbance consist of     a con
densation alone,    it will be transmitted with the velocity a(l —e) in
the direction in which its particles are moving            ;  and that  if it consists
of a rarefaction alone, it will       be transmitted     with the velocity    a(l + e)
in the direction contrary to that in which its particles                are moving.
It  is here shown      also incidentally, that whether            the resistance be
taken into account        or not, the particles of a wave of condensation
must all move in the same direction,               which will be the direction of
transmission    ; and the particles of a wave          of rarefaction will all move
in the same direction, which will          be   contrary to that of transmission.
   In con<U+FB01>rmation of          the conclusion      that waves of rarefaction        are
transmitted more rapidly than waves of condensation, the author
adduces the fact, that when explosions of gunpowder have taken
place,    the glass in windows has been observed to break outwards
rather than inwards.
   It  is then suggested, that, as when sound is produced,                 a conden
sation and rarefaction        of air usually occur in immediate succession,
if both kinds of disturbance were capable of affecting the human car,
we   should hear sounds double; and             as we   know practically that this
is not the case,   it is contended that only one kind of disturbance,
i. e. either rarefaction alone, or else condensation alone, can stimulate
the ear.                                                    _
   It  is shown to be     1) priori probable, that if one of the two classes
of aerial disturbance is suppressed by the             ear, that one  would    b‘e dis
turbance by condensation,          inasmuch       as waves     of rarefaction being
swifter, would better perform the duty entrusted to them: and it is
pointed out that     if the    sensation of sound is produced by aerial rare
factions alone, a di<U+FB02>iculty attending            the received theory will be ob
viated, by reason of the velocity deduced upon that theory being too
 small.
   The author considers, however, that the question, whether either
and which of the kinds of aerial disturbance is suppressed, can only
 be satisfactorily determined by examination of the ear itself.                    He
                                                                     11 2

                                           226
 accordingly endeavours to establish, by arguments derived from the
 structure    of the   ear,  that aerial rarefactions       are  alone capable     of
 stimulating that organ        in man.       These   arguments      are    brie<U+FB02>y as
 follows   :—
     1.  The tympanal membrane being convex inwards, a condensation
 could only affect the air in the tympanal cavity by stretching the
 membrane, which would           cause   an expenditure      of force; whereas a
 rarefaction    would produce      the    effect by a    simple <U+FB02>exure of the
 membrane.                               _
     2. The sense    of hearing being certainly produced by the motion
 of the <U+FB02>uid in the labyrinth, which is           a closed vessel    <U+FB01>lled with an
incompressible      <U+FB02>uid, the requisite motion could not be produced by
a compression      of the atmosphere.
    3. The disposition of the muscles of the ear is such as is calculated
to assist and regulate the impressions produced by rarefactions rather
than those produced by condensations.
    4. The existence      of the Eustachian tube is indispensable to the
action    of the organ (when all its other parts        are   in a normal state),
on the supposition      that sound is occasioned by rarefaction          ;  whereas
its uses are not satisfactorily      predicable on the contrary hypothesis.
    The author     observes,  that   if rarefactions   alone produce sound,       it
follows that a simple contraction of the muscles of the ear will ren
der sounds inaudible.         It follows also, on the same hypothesis,          that
a more delicate exercise       of the    same muscles     will render the organ
minutely susceptible to the in<U+FB02>uence           of certain sounds, to the exclu
sion    of others.   It is urged also, that, admitting the action of these
muscles to be to a large extent involuntary, there can be no doubt
that    by practice   a great degree      of command may be acquired over
them.       The author conceives that         we may    in this way account for
the facility acquired by many persons of reading and writing, and                 of
carrying on intricate trains of thought, without being disturbed by,
or being conscious of, the noises around them.                  He conceives also
that the    same mode    of explanation may be applied to account for the
power of appreciating        and analysing      the most complex        harmonies
possessed     by persons having a <U+FB01>ne musical          car; which the author
considers to be as certainly the result        of speci<U+FB01>c mental and muscular
training,    as the   faculty of vocalization, or the art of playing on            a
keyed instrument.

                                   227
   The author concludes by observing, that the equations for the
transmission of an undulation along a musical string require a similar
correction to that introduced in the     case  of aerial vibrations.    The
discussion   of this branch of the subject    he reserves  for a future op
portunity.

       April  13,  1858.
                               (Abstract.)
   In this  paper the author stated that the Hadleian theory      of winds,
which is now the one generally recognized, is not supported by the
evidence of facts, but rests on assumptions founded on imaginary
effects of the partial expansion of the atmospheric    gases  by heat.   It
is assumed   in that theory, that when the tropical heat expands these
gases,  they rise and <U+FB02>ow away laterally in the higher regions towards
the poles, from which they return to the tropics in the lower regions.
But it was contended by the writer of the paper, that such heating

                                                           228
of the     gases           merely expands them, without making them rise and
overflow to other parts. The theory of Halley, once generally adopted,
represented that the air was greatly heated in the particular part
where the sun was nearly vertical, which made the air rise in that
part alone, admitting                   cooler air to flow into the place of that which
had ascended, and produced an influx of cool air below, from                                                      all   parts
around,         to    the heated part, and                  an   overflow above from                     it.       But      in
time experience showed that this hypothesis                                        was not        in     accordance
with facts, and               it   was abandoned.                     The theory            of    Hadley, which
has been since adopted, substitutes the whole tropical belt, for the
heated locality               of   Halley, which travelled with the sun                                 in    his daily

supported              by    experience, and, being unproved,                            may                 fallacious.
The rise         of    heated air       in         chimney, sometimes pointed                                as   an    illus

that   it            gravitation which establishes                      an   equilibrium          of    pressure            in
the atmosphere, and that direct solar heating                                          of   the surface             of   the
earth and the air near                    to   it,
                                                 does not destroy that equilibrium.                                     The
sun    by     heating the gases                merely expands them,     proportion     in                           to   the
increase       of     temperature           in     the part near the surface, and the gases
over every portion                 of  the hemisphere that                   is   exposed      to   the action              of
the sun               proportionally heated, expanded and raised without any
overflow      of is   air taking place; leaving the equilibrium  pressure un                   of
disturbed             by   such heating. The solar heat merely raises the air that
is   near the surface, over the most heated latitudes,                                   a   little higher than
the adjoining               less heated, the difference                     in    the rise       in   the various
latitudes, from the polar                          to   the tropical regions, being successively
small; and              as   there     is   no     alteration produced              in   the weight               of     any
vertical column               of   the atmosphere,               in    any latitude, there                   is   neither
overflow         of    air above, nor disturbance                     of   the equilibrium             of     pressure.
The great disturbances that take place                                 in   the atmosphere were then
maintained             to    be   caused
                                               by       the heat which            is   conveyed, from                    the
surface       of     the globe,        in   vapour         to   different parts          of   the atmosphere

                                     229
at  various heights, and liberated in those parts when the vapour is
condensed into liquid. This liberation of heat creates ascending cur
rents in the parts locally affected, when horizontal        winds, produced
by gravitation,    blow over the surface towards the ascending currents
to re-establish    the disturbed equilibrium.      This process, by heating
the air in the middle regions, was asserted to have been proved to be
the cause, not only      of the great trade-winds and the monsoons, but
of the storms and local winds over the different regions of the globe.
II.    “Notes of     Researches    on the Poly-Ammonias.”           By A. W.
        HoFMANN, LL.D., F.R.S.—No.              II.  Action of Chloroform
        upon Aniline.       Received   April 15, 1858.
     In a former Note addressed to the Royal Society (Proceedings,
vol. ix. p. 150),    I have alluded to some new alkaloids which are         pro
 duced by the action      of the bromides of triatomic alcohols upon the
 primary amidogen       bases.
     I have  since examined more minutely one       of these bodies.      At the
 common temperature, chloroform          and aniline   may be   left in contact
 for a considerable time without any change becoming               perceptible.
 Even at the temperature of boiling water scarcely any reaction takes
 place.    But on exposing for ten or twelve hours        a mixture    of about
 equal volumes      of chloroform and aniline in sealed       tubes to a tem
 perature of 180° or 190° C., a hard brown crystalline mass is ob
 tained, which consists chiefly of the hydrochlorates of aniline and of
 a new crystalline base.
      To obtain this compound in a state of purity, the brown crystalline
  mixture formed in the digester-tubes is triturated with a small quan
  tity of water, thrown upon a filter and washed with water. The first
  washings    chiefly   consist  of hydrochlorate    of aniline, which      base
  separates in oily globules on addition    of potassa to the filtrate. By
  testing the filtrate in this manner from time to time, it is found that
  the basic body separated by addition of potassa gradually exhibits a
  tendency to solidify, and ultimately falls as a yellowish-white        crystal
  line precipitate.     The residue upon the filter is now dissolved in
  warm (not     boiling)  water, separated by a filter from a brown resinous
  insoluble substance, and precipitated      by ammonia or potassa.          The
  crystalline precipitate obtained in this manner is washed       till free from

                                                      230
alkali, and repeatedly crystallized from weak spirit.                                         It   is difficult
to obtain it perfectly white, a yellowish substance, which appears to
be partly formed              during the process of solution, adhering with great
pertinacity.                                                                                  -
  Thus obtained, the new base is a white crystalline powder; fre
quently it is obtained in minute scales, generally of a yellowish tint.
It   is insoluble in water, but readily dissolves in alcohol and ether.
From the hot solution in these solvents it is precipitated by water as
a yellow oil, solidifying on cooling with crystalline structure.  It is
easily dissolved by acids, with many                              of which it forms crystalline
compounds.               From the saline solutions thus produced the base is
reprecipitated           by potassa and also by ammonia.                              The salts of the
new base are not very stable; their solutions, especially when heated
for   some time, inevitably contain more or less aniline, the crystalline
base     itself undergoing               changes which             I    have not yet sufficiently
examined.
  The analysis of the new compound presents some difficulty.
Even after protracted exposure over sulphuric acid in the exsiccator,
it retains       a small quantity               of water, while             a temperature          of 100° is
apt to decompose                it.
     The nature          of    the body was, however, readily established                                    by   the
examination        perfectly stable hydrochlorate,
                        ofa                                                         and also        of   a    very
definite platinum-salt.
     The results obtained               in     the analysis       of   these salts establish            for the
new base the formula

                                                                       |
    It is   obviously formed by the substitution                            of   the triatomic molecule

which thus coalesce into                 a     diamine molecule.                 Accordingly the base

   As   seen from this equation, the new base, although        unmistakeably
 corresponding      to  2 molecules of ammonia, like many other poly
 ammonias, is monoacid.
   The analysis of the hydrochlorate leads in fact to the formula
                                 C26 H12 N2, HCl.
   The platinum-salt contains
                             C25 H1, N2, HCI, PtCl,.
   The new derivative of aniline undergoes several remarkable changes
which require further elucidation.

    In this paper the author gives an account of certain tubular and
vesicular bodies which he has discovered in the spermatic cord, and
which he considers to be the remains of the Wol<U+FB01>ian body of the
embryo.
   The structures in question, which he proposes to designate col
                           “
lectively by the term        Corps Innominé,” form a small group situated
behind the tunica vaginalis, between that membrane and the spermatic
vessels, and extending        usually from the head of the epididymis       as
high as the point where the membrane is re<U+FB02>ected forwards from the
cord; sometimes, however, reaching much higher up, or, on the
other hand, being more concentrated in the neighbourhood of the
                                                                  '
epididymis.
  ‘The “Corps Innominé” is found in the new-born infant, and in a
more or less modi<U+FB01>ed condition at all later periods of life; it has
also been met with in the lower animals.          To facilitate its detection
and examination, the author has found it advantageous previously to
render the surrounding tissues transparent,         by macerating the sper
matic cord in an acid solution, for which purpose he recommends the
use  of tartaric or citric acid in the infant, and of dilute nitric acid in
the adult.

    After this preparation minute whitish specks make their appear
ance in the situation above mentioned, which, when examined with
the microscope,      are found to be produced        by small  vesicles and
convoluted tubes    of varied and curious shape, surrounded by      a plexus
of small blood-vessels, which     are distributed   on their parietes.   The
tubes are short, tortuous, and for the most part beset with very un
equal-sized   and irregular varicose dilatations,      and sometimes with
short branches ending in rounded swollen extremities.           The vesicles
are round or oval, like short closed segments of a varicose tube, and
generally with irregularly protruding        outline.    The walls of both
vesicles and tubes are formed    of a <U+FB01>brous connective tissue, and lined
with epithelium, and they enclose a consistent but clear <U+FB02>uid, hold
ing in suspension epithelium-particles and transparent granules. This
description   applies to the condition    of the structures in question as
found in the infant, and up to the age of from six to ten years; after
this they begin to be atrophied,     so  that although still present in the
adult, they are usually less marked    ; but, on the other hand, they then
sometimes contain a more consistent liquid, and are occasionally          di
lated, so as   to constitute certain forms of cysts known to occur in
 the spermatic cord.
    As already stated, the author regards the “ Corps Innominé” as
 formed by the atrophied remains of the Wol<U+FB02>ian body, and there
 fore comparable to the so-called     “organ of Rosenmiiller,” which is
 found in the broad ligament of the uterus, and represents the ves
 tiges of the Wol<U+FB02>ian body in the female; and as certain vesicular
 productions    in the broad ligament      may take their rise from these
 remnants, so the author,     as before remarked,      has satis<U+FB01>ed himself
 that the origin of some of the cysts of the spermatic cord may be
 traced to dilatation of the tubular elements of the “ Corps Innominé”
 in the male.
    The paper is illustrated by drawings representing the objects in
 their natural size and situation, and also as seen under the microscope.

IV. “On         Chondrosteus,      an Extinct Genus of Fish allied to the
        Sturionidae.”         By Sir PHILIP DE MALPAs GREY EGERTON,
        Bart., F.R.S.         Received      April 20, 1858.

  Before the conclusion of his great work on Fossil Fishes,                          Pro
fessor Agassiz recognized in some fragmentary                remains found in the
lias strata at Lyme Regis, unmistakeable evidence of the existence, at
that period of the earth's deposition, of a representative of the still
extant family of the Sturgeons.     To this extinct fish he assigned
the name Chondrosteus.                 The author of the present memoir has
been enabled,      by the examination            of numerous specimens more           re
cently acquired, to describe in some detail the external features                      of
the fish, and the structural             peculiarities   of those portions of the
exo- and endo-skeleton which have been preserved.                           In the former
respect the fossil differs from the recent sturgeon in having a shorter
and deeper trunk, in the greater vertical expanse and wider                        diver
gence   of the lobes of the caudal fin, in the median position of the
dorsal fin, and in the absence            of dermal plates on the back, belly,
and flanks.       Before      describing       the cranial   anatomy,         the author
points out certain homologies between the head-plates of the recent
sturgeon and the epicranial              bones of the teleostean fishes, more
especially with reference to the parietals, mastoids and frontals; and
explains that these conclusions have resulted from the examination
of the inner table of skull, where the relative position and propor
tions   of the component plates are constant, however much the outer
or dermal layer may vary.
  The remainder of the memoir is devoted to detailed descriptions
of such parts                   in the several specimens; and the
                   as are preserved
author concludes by stating as the result of his investigations, that
Professor Agassiz was right in referring the liasic fish to the
Sturionidae;      that   in some respects it evidenced a transitional form

  I. “On the Resistance of Tubes to collapse.” By WILLIAM
        FAIRBAIRN, Esq., C.E., F.R.S. &c.               Received April 21,
        1 858.
                                    (Abstract.)
    The object kept in view by the author of these researches was to
  determine the law which governed the resistance         of cylindrical tubes
 to external uniform pressure.         The anomalous condition       in which
 these constructions    have been placed in reference to the internal <U+FB01>ues
 of boilers, and the frequent fatal accidents from explosions produced
 by collapse, have imperatively called for inquiry into the causes which
 have led to these unfortunate results.         Ever since the <U+FB01>rst introduc
 tion of the   steam  engine as improved      by Watt, and especially since
 the increased     demand    for its construction,    and its application   to
 almost every branch       of industry and every system of transit, the
 consideration of all circumstances which may affect its economy and
 security, has become of vast public importance.
    During the more early period which followed its <U+FB01>rst introduction,
 the form of boiler and its powers of resistance to strain, were con
 siderations of much less importance than at present. Then the force
of steam, or the pressure under which it was generated, was only
about one-eighth, and in some cases less than a sixteenth of what            it
now is.     Besides, the fertile genius of Watt had provided           against
accident,   by  a self-acting   apparatus,   which regulated not only the
pressure, but the supply      of water to the boiler.      Since that time    a.
total change has taken place in the construction         and working of the
steam engine; and boilers     which were perfectly safe at 7 lbs. upon the
square inch, are absolutely inadequate for generating steam at 40 lbs.
to 50 lbs. on the square inch. This being the case, it follows that every
precaution    becomes urgently necessary which may serve to increase
the strength, and equalize the resisting power of vessels containing

                                                          235
an element  of such potent influence, and yet so essential to the com
forts and enjoyments of civilized life.
     Entertaining these views, the author goes on to say, that hitherto
it has been considered an axiom in boiler engineering, that a cylin
drical tube, placed in the position of an internal flue, is equally
strong in every part when subjected to uniform external pressure;
the length not affecting the strength of a flue so placed.                                                      This rule
is,   however, only true when applied                                                  infinitely great length,
                                                                                  of of
                                                                   to   tubes
and    it     is   very far from true when the length                                   the tube does not                   ex
ceed       certain limits, and when the ends                             are retained           in       form       by   being
riveted         to   the boiler, and thus prevented from yielding                                              to   external
pressure.              These facts were fully demonstrated                                     by   the experiments
related        in   the Paper, which, for obvious reasons were conducted under
circumstances              as     nearly      as   possible analogous                  to   those now               in   actual
operation upon             a      larger scale.          With           this view,         a   large and powerful
cylinder,          8   feet long, and              2   feet   in    diameter, was prepared for the
reception           of   the tubes; and being acted upon                               by   hydraulic pressure,
collapse was produced, and the results recorded,                                                as   fully explained
in   the Paper.           It    will suffice here            to    state the more important conclu
sions derived from the investigation, which fell under the following
heads: viz.—1st, the strength                            of   tubes          as   affected          by   length; 2nd,
the strength             of   tubes      as   affected        by   diameter;           lastly, the strength                     of
tubes         as   affected

are conclusive             and interesting.                   Within the limits                     of   from            foot

those of larger dimensions, the strengths diminishing as the lengths
are increased.
        The        same law           of resistance is maintained in 6-inch tubes, giving,
for a tube 30 inches long,                              55 lbs., and            for    one 59 inches               long only
32 lbs. on the square inch, as the pressure                                            of collapse. Again, in                     8

    The above variations are slight when compared with the resisting
powers             of   the tubes; they are doubtless caused                                   by   the varying             rigid
ity      of     the iron,        or    by    defects        in   the cylindrical form.           Similar results
follow          in    the experiments                  on   tubes      2   feet   6   inches long; and although
some slight variations                            occur, they are nevertheless not more than
might have                  been anticipated                within the ordinary limits                        of   error.
        3.      The strength            of    tubes         as   affected         by   thickness.
        In    these experiments                   it    is   found that the tubes vary                            in   strength
according               to  a    certain power               in      the thickness; the index                      of   which,

                                         237
 taken from the mean of the experiments,                 is 2'19, or rather higher
 than the square.
    Combining the above laws into            a general expression,          we have, as
 the formula for the strength       of tubes subjected to           a uniform external
force,
                                             /52-19
                                  P=C><
                                            Lx      D’
 where    P  is the collapsing      pressure,    la  the thickness      of the plates,
 L   the length     of the tube, which should not be less than 1'5, or
 greater than 10 feet; D the diameter, and C a constant to be deter
 mined by the experiments.           For tubes of greater length than those
 above   speci<U+FB01>ed, a variable quantity, dependent upon the length, must
 be  introduced   ;  and the value of this has yet to be determined.                 For
 ordinary practical calculations       the following formula will probably,
however, afford the needful accuracy :—
                              _
                            P-806,300       X

                                                L X D.
    Thus, for example, take        a tube or boiler-<U+FB02>ue           10 feet long, 2 feet
diameter,    and composed of plates         %  inch thick; and the collapsing
pressure will be
                                           -25*
                      P=806,300       ><             =2l0     lbs.
                                         10 x   24
per square inch or nearly so.
    Some experiments have also been made upon elliptical tubes                    ; and
the results have been most conclusive               as to the weakness         of such
forms in resisting external pressure.               No tubes in use for boilers
should ever    be made    of that form.
    With regard to cylindrical internal <U+FB02>ues, the experiments indicate
the necessity of an important modi<U+FB01>cation of the ordinary mode of
construction, in order to render them secure at the high pressures to
which they are now almost constantly subjected.                    If we take  a boiler  _
of the ordinary construction,        30 feet long,        7  feet in diameter,      and
with one or more <U+FB02>ues       3  feet diameter, it will       be   found that the outer
shell or envelope is from three to three and              a half times    as strong   in
resisting an internal force as the cylindrical <U+FB02>ues which have to resist
the same external force.         This being the        case,   it is evident that the
excess of strength in those parts        of the   vessel subjected to tension, is

                                                         238
 actually        of no    use so long as the elements                      of weakness are present
 in the other parts subjected to compression.
      To remedy           these     defects,       it is proposed to rivet strong rings of
 angle iron at intervals along the flue—thus practically                                      reducing          its
 length,        or   in   other words increasing                    its   strength     to   a    uniformity

 terested       in   the construction              of   vessels    so   important      to   the success         of
our manufacturing system, and yet fraught with such potent elements
 of   disaster when unscientifically constructed                           or   improperly         managed.

These odd numbers may                        be   divided into     4    squares, and the roots may

2   more, the other            2    less than the corresponding roots                       of   the other.
Putting the roots below the number and comparing them, the result
is   obvious.

the result is the same;                          and     it is true of         all   adjoining odd squares.

      If,   instead     of      comparing the adjoining squares, the alternate squares
be    compared,         a       similar result             is   obtained; the middle roots                       are the

     The proof          of       this property depends upon                          a   general property                  of
all   odd numbers and upon                           a   general theorem.
     The property                of    odd numbers              is   this, that every odd number can
be    divided into          4     squares         in    such manner that              2     of   the roots will            be

     capable (from               its   magnitude)             of    having roots large enough

into    12+       l'+ l’+6’,           and then the equal roots are discovered.                                        It   is
proved from the known properties            of numbers that this property of
having 2          roots whose difference will be 0, 1, 2, 3, &c., as far as is
possible, belongs to all odd numbers.                                 A            new symbol is then sug
gested to represent                   the division          of   a number                    into 4 squares, such
that    2    of the roots will have                  a given difference, and these are made
the exterior roots; the number or <U+FB01>gure denoting                                                      the difference is
placed           above on the left                 hand: thus ‘25 denotes 0,                                0,   3,   4     or
—2,         l,   4,    2; '25 denotes l,                2, 4, 2.
   The general theorem is this :—If any odd number of odd numbers

9, 13, I7, 21, 25, then if the common difference be assumed as the
index of the difference of roots to the middle term, and the higher
terms in the series have as indices (4 +1), (4 +2), &c. in succession,
and the lower terms have as indices                                 (4-1), (4-2),                       &c., the series
with its indices will be

then the terms greater than the middle term will have this relation
to the terms less than the middle term                                ;    the terms equidistant from

  An algebraic proof                     is       then    given as to                  a     series     whose     middle

        Comparing       the terms above with the terms below,                                      it is manifest
   the terms  of the series are divisible into 4 squares whose roots con
   form to the law of the theorem. It is then shown that the odd squares,
   and also all the numbers mentioned in the beginning of the paper,
   can be made terms            in an arithmetic                   series,       and will therefore              have
   the property         stated.     It    is then suggested that the properties                                    of
   numbers stated in the paper may have been in some form a portion
   of the mysterious properties of numbers by which Fermat announced
   he could prove his celebrated theorem of the polygonal numbers.
         A Postscript     was added,           dated 20th May, which is here given
   entire.
        Since this paper was sent to the Society, some other theorems of
   a   similar kind have occurred to me, in which the terms of a series
   (not arithmetical of the 1st order) have a similar relation with regard
   to the roots of the 4 squares of which they may be composed, that
   is,those which are equidistant from the middle, or the middle term
   (according as the number of terms    even or odd), have the middle
                                                                 is
   roots the same, and the exterior roots have an arithmetical relation
   to each      other (varying with the distance from the centre), viz. the
   one     being less and the other greater by the                           same       quantity.
        Thus,   if   any number          of terms (exceeding                       3)   of either of the           2
   series above-mentioned                          1,   3,       9,   19, &c., or        1,   5,   13, 25,      &c.),

  of the valley towards which the glacier turns its convex curvature.
   It has hitherto been believed that the portion of the Mer de Glace
  derived from       the Glacier du Géant          moved swiftest.     The _author
  shows that the tributaries        which form the Mer         de  Glace lose their
  individuality in the trunk stream, the latter <U+FB02>owing as if it proceeded
  from a single source. The point of maximum motion is sometimes
  on the eastern, sometimes on the western side of a line drawn along
  the centre    of the glacier, the change from side to side depending
  upon the curvature of the valley.             The locus of the point of swiftest
  motion    in   a   glacier   which    moves      through a sinuous valley, is
  exactly similar to that       of a river moving through       a sinuous channel    ;
  it forms   a curve     more deeply       sinuous than the valley       itself, and
  crosses the centre     of the valley at each point of contrary <U+FB02>exure.
      A rare opportunity of determining the comparative velocities of
  a glacier at its surface and close to its bed, was          furnished by   a preci
  pice  of ice  140 feet    in height, which was exposed near the Tacul.
  Three stakes were <U+FB01>xed in this precipice, one at the top, the other
  near the bottom, and a third in the face of the precipice at a height
  of nearly 40     feet above the bottom      ;  the velocities of the three stakes
  were found to be        6  inches, 4'59 inches, and 2'56 inches per           day;
  thus furnishing additional        proof of the correctness of the law <U+FB01>rst
  predicted by Prof. Forbes, and con<U+FB01>rmed subsequently by his own
  observations and those of M. Martins.
      Attention is drawn to the immense exertion of force necessary to
  drive the glacier through the neck            of the valley at Trelaporte. The
  sum of the width of the three tributaries of the Mer de Glace before
  they mutually act upon each other is 2597 yards.                    All  these are
  squeezed through a gorge at Trelaporte, measuring 893 yards across.
  The Glacier     de  Léchaud, which, before its junction with the Talefre,
  possesses   a  width of upwards of 37 chains, is          squeezed  at Trelaporte
  to a driblet less than 4 chains wide.
      As  a natural consequence       of this obstacle in front, the Glacier du
  Géant is generally in a       state of longitudinal compression.          But the
  mechanical meaning         of this term must be that the points behind are
  incessantly advancing upon those in front,--the distance between two
- points upon the axis of the glacier being thus gradually diminished.
  The daily motion of these points upon the axis of this glacier was
  determined, which led to the remarkable result, that a section of the
   glacier 1000 yards in length is shortened by the thrust to which it

                                        247
is subjected, at the rate     of 8 inches is day; which,   if the   action were
uniform at all     seasons,  would amount to 240 feet     a year.
     The author also describes a system of remarkable bands of white
 ice which he observed to sweep across the Glacier du Géant in the
 same general direction as the “ dirt-bands.”         He traced these bands
 to the following origin.        The streams which <U+FB02>ow upon the glacier
 in its upper portions, cut     deep   channels in the ice  ;   these channels,
  during the winter,      become gorged with snow, which is afterwards
  compressed to a highly resistant white ice during the descent           of the
  glacier.   Similar bands were also observed in a most remarkable           po
  sition at the  base  of the Talefre cascade; and here also he found the
  glacier crumpled into a series of protuberances, one consequence
  of the crumpling being the production of a “ backward ” as well as
  a. forward  “ dip ” of the  veined structure.     A similar    system  of pro
  tuberances occurs on the Glacier du Géant       ; and here also the author
  found the same structure dipping backward as well           as forward.   The
  cause of the crumpling is assigned in the paper.
      The physical quality in virtue of which ice is able to change its
 form in the manner indicated by the observations is next inquired
 into ; and it is shown by measurements carried out upon the glacier
 itself, that no quality which could with propriety be called viscosity
  is possessed by glacier ice.     All  the phenomena    appear to be rec0n~
  ciled by reference to the fragility of ice at a tenfperature of 32° F.,
  coupled with its power of regelation.        The intestine motion of the
  parts is no doubt aided to some extent by the partial liquefaction of
  the ice by pressure; a fact <U+FB01>rst publicly pointed out by Mr. James
 Thomson, and proved experimentally by Prof. William Thomson
 and the author.

       tion.”’ By Sir CHARLES LYELL, F.R.S., 820. Received
       June 10, 1858.
                                (Abstract.)
    The question whether lava can consolidate on       a steep slope, so as
to form strata of stony and compact rock, inclined at angles         of from
 10°  to more than 30°, has of late years acquired        considerable im
portance,   because geologists   of high authority have af<U+FB01>rmed that
lavas which congeal on a declivity exceeding 5° or 6° are never con
tinuous and solid, but are entirely composed of scoriaceous and frag
mentary materials.     From the law thus supposed to govern the con
solidation  of melted matter of volcanic origin, it has      been  logically
inferred that all great volcanic mountains owe their conical form prin
cipally to upheaval or to a force acting from below and exerting an

                                       249
upward and outward pressure on beds originally horizontal or nearly
horizontal.      For in all such mountains there are found to exist some
stony   layers dipping at      10°, 15°, 25°, or even    higher angles; and
according to the assumed law, such an inclined position of the beds
must have been acquired subsequently to their origin.
    After giving   a  brief sketch of the controversy respecting “ Craters
of Elevation,”     the author describes the results of his recent visit
(October, 1857) to Mount Etna, in company with Signor Gaetano
G. Gemmellaro, and his discovery there of modern lavas, some of
known date, which have formed continuous              beds of compact stone
on slopes   of  15°, 36°, 38°, and,   in the  case of the lava of 1852, more
than 40°.      The thickness of these tabular layers varies from 1% foot
to 26 feet; and their planes of strati<U+FB01>cation are parallel to those of
the overlying and underlying scoriee which form part of the same
currents.     The most striking examples of this phenomenon were
met with—1st, at Aci Reale; 2ndly, in the ravine called the Cava
 Grande near Milo, where        a section  of the lava of 1689 is obtained;
3rdly, in the precipice at the head of the Val di Calarma, in the lava
of 1852-53     ;  and 4thly, at a great height above the sea near the
base of the Montagnuola.
    Sir C. Lyell then alludes to the extraordinary changes which had
 taken place in the scenery of the Valley of Calanna and the Val del
 Bove since his former visit to Mount Etna in 1828—-changes effected
by the eruption of 1852-53, one of the greatest recorded in history.
A brief account      is given, extracted from contemporary     narratives and
illustrated by a map, compiled with the assistance of Dr. Giuseppe
Gemmellaro, of the course taken in 1852-53 by various streams of
lava, some    of them six miles in length, <U+FB02>owing during nine succes
sive months from the head of the Val del Bove to the suburbs of
Zafarana and Milo. The present aspect of this lava-<U+FB01>eld, parts of
it still hot and emitting vapour, and the numerous longitudinal ridges
and furrows on its surface are described.           As to the origin of these
super<U+FB01>cial inequalities, the author inquires whether they may be due
to the <U+FB02>owing of lava in subterranean tunnels, or whether they be
 anticlinal and synclinal     folds caused by fresh streams pouring over
 preceding and half-consolidated        ones, so that these last may be bent
 and crumpled by the newly superimposed weight, like soft yielding
 ground on which a railway embankment has been made. The cas

                                          250
cade   of the lava of 1852, descending            a precipitous      declivity 500 feet
high, called the Salto della Giumenta, and the stony character of the
layers which encrust the steep slope at angles of more than 35° and
even 45°,     are commented         upon.         This lava has over<U+FB02>owed     that
of 1819, which congealed         on the same       precipice; and it is shown that
in such    cases    the junction-lines         separating two successive currents
must     be obliterated,    the bottom          scoriae    of the newer dovetailing
into the upper scoria: of the older current.
   The structure of the nucleus of Etna, as exhibited                       in sections       in
the Val del Bove,      is next treated of, and the doctrine                   of   a   double
axis is deduced from the varying dip of the beds.                           The strata        of
trachyte and trachytic agglomerate               in the Serra Giannicola               seen   at
the base of the lofty precipice at the head of the Val del Bove are in
clined at angles of 20° to 30°          N.W., i.      e. towards the present           central
axis of eruption.  Other strata to the eastwards (as in the hill of Zoe
colaro) dip in an opposite direction, or S.E., while, in a great part of
the north and south escarpments of the Val del Bove, the beds dip
N.E. or N., and S.E. or          S. respectively.          There    is,   therefore, aqua
quaversal dip away from some point situated in the centre of the area
called the Piano di Trifoglietto.              Here   a   permanent axis of eruption
may have existed for ages in the earlier history of Etna, for which
the name of the axis        of Trifoglietto       is   proposed,     while the modern
centre   of eruption, that now in activity, may                   be called the axis          of
Mongibello.        The two      axes,   which are three miles distant the one
from the other, are illustrated by an ideal section through the whole
of Etna, passing from west to           east   through the Val del Bove, or from
Bronte to Zafarana.         Touching the relative           age   of the two cones,           it
is   suggested that   a   portion only of that of Mongibello may                   be newer
than the cone of Trifoglietto.            The latter, when         it   became dormant,
was entirely       overwhelmed      and buried         under      the upper and more
modern     lavas of the greater cone.              This doctrine of two centres,
originally hinted at       by
                      the late Mario Gemmellaro, had been worked
out (unknown to Sir C. Lyell at the time of his visit) Baron Sar            by
torius v. Waltershausen,         and has been            in the <U+FB01>fth
                                                       since supported
                                         “ The Atlas of Etna
                                                              ” both
and sixth parts of his great work called
by arguments founded on the quaqu<U+FB01>versal dip of the beds as above
explained,    and by the convergence             of   a   certain class     of greenstone
dikes towards the axis of Trifoglietto.                Von Waltershausen           has also

                                    251
shown that the superior lavas and volcanic formations crowning the
precipices at the head of the Val del Bove, from the Serra Giannicola
to the Rocca del Corvo, inclusive, are unconformable to the highly in
clined beds in the lower half of the same precipice, the superior beds
being horizontal, or, when inclined, dipping in such directions as would
imply that they slope away from the higher parts of Mongibello.
   According to Sir C. Lyell, the alleged discontinuity between the
older and modern products         of Etna is, in truth, only partial, and
almost con<U+FB01>ned to that <U+FB02>ank of the mountain, where its physical geo
graphy has been altered by three causes: lst, the interference of the
two foci of eruption (Trifoglietto and Mongibello) ; 2ndly, the trun
cation of the cone of Mongibello; and 3rdly, the formation of the
 Val del Bove.     The truncation of the mountain             here alluded to is
proved by the remains of the upper portion of a cone, traceable at
intervals around the borders of an elevated platform between 9000
 and 10,000 feet high.      These remains bear the same relation to the
 highest and active cone, nearly in the centre of the platform, which
 Somma bears to Vesuvius.      The manner in which the north and
 south escarpments of the Val del Bove diminish in altitude                as they
 trend eastward from the high platfonn, is appealed to               as showing
 that the great lateral valley had no existence till after the time when
 Mongibello had attained its fullest development and height.
   The double axis of Etna is then compared to the twofold axis of
 the island of Madeira, as inferred from observations made in 1354
 by   M. Hartung    and the author.    In   that island the principal chain
 of volcanic vents, running   east and west, and 30 miles long, attains at
 one point a height of 6000 feet.         Parallel to   it,   at the distance     of
 two miles,   a   shorter and lower,   secondary chain once existed, but
 was afterwards     over<U+FB02>owed     and buried   to   a   great depth       by lavas
 issuing from the higher and dominant chain.              The     space    between
 the two axes, like the      which separated the two cones of Etna,
                          space
 has been <U+FB01>lled up with lavas in part horizontal. On the north side
 of Madeira, as probably on the west side of Etna, where no second
 ary centre of eruption interfered with the slope of the volcanic for
 mations, and where the order of their succession and superposition
 is   uninterrupted, there occur, both in Madeira and Etna,               deep   cra
 teriform valleys (the Curral and the Val del Bove) intersecting the
 products of the two axes of eruption.

                                        252
      In concluding    this part of his memoir, Sir C. Lyell observes, that
   the admission    of  a double axis, as explained    by him, is irreconcile
  able with the hypothesis of “craters of elevation;” for it implies that,
  in the cone-making       process, the force of upheaval       merely plays   a
   subordinate part.     One cone of eruption, he says, may envelope and
   bury an adjoining cone of eruption; but it is obviously impossible
  that one cone of upheaval should mantle round and overwhelm
  another cone of upheaval.
      An attempt is then made to estimate the proportional amount of
  inclination which may be due to upheaval in those parts of the
  central nucleus of Etna where the dip is too great to be ascribed
  exclusively to the original steepness    of the <U+FB02>anks of the cone.       The
  highest dip seen by the author was in the rock of Musarra, where
  some   of the strata, consisting      of scoriae  with  a   few intercalated
  lavas, are inclined at 47°.     Some masses of agglomerate and beds        of
 lava in the     Serra del    Sol<U+FB01>zio   were also seen     inclined   at angles
 exceeding 40°.       Some   of these instances    are believed to be excep
 tional   and due to local disturbance;        others may have an intimate
 connexion    with    the  abundance    of <U+FB01>ssures, often of great width,
 <U+FB01>lled   with lava, for such dikes are much more frequent near the
 original centres of eruption than at points remote from them.
 The injection     of  so much    liquid matter into countless rents may
 imply the gradual tumefaction and distension of the volcanic mass,
 and may have been attended by the tilting of the beds, causing them
 to slope away at steeper angles than before, from the axis of erup
tion.     But instead of ascribing to this mechanical force,          as many
 have done, nearly all, or about four-<U+FB01>fths        of the whole dip, Sir C.
 Lyell considers that about one-<U+FB01>fth may, with more probability,            be
assigned as the effect of such movements.
     The alleged parallelism and uniformity of thickness in the volcanic
beds of the Val del Bove, when traced over wide areas, is next con
sidered, and the author        remarks   that neither   in the northern nor
southern    escarpments of the great valley, could he and his compa
nion verify the existence     of such parallelism.    Examples    of a marked
deviation from     it are given, both in cliffs seen from      a distance, and
in others which were closely inspected, even in cases where these last,
when viewed from far off, appeared to contain regular and parallel
strata.

                                    253
   The direction and position of the dikes in the Val del Bove is then
spoken of, both in reference to the two ancient centres of eruption,
and to the question of the altered inclination of the intersected beds.
In regard to the arrangement also of the lateral cones of eruption,
the question is entertained, whether they are disposed in linear zones,
or are in some degree independent of the great centre of Mongibello.
   The origin of the Val del Bove has been variously ascribed to
engulfment,    explosion, and aqueous erosion.   Admitting the probable
in<U+FB02>uence of the two <U+FB01>rst      causes, the author calls attention     to the
positive   evidence in favour of aqueous denudation       afforded   by the
accumulation of alluvium in the low country at the eastern base of
Etna between the Val del Bove and the sea. This rudely strati<U+FB01>ed
deposit, 150 feet thick and several miles in length and breadth, con
tains at Giarre, Mangano,     Riposto and other places, fragments, both
rounded and angular, of all the rocks, ancient and modern, occurring
in the escarpments of the Val del Bove, and it implies the con
tinuance there for ages of powerful aqueous erosion.         The alluvium
of Giarre is therefore supposed to bear the     same relation to the     Val
del Bove that the conglomerate        of the Barranco    de las  Angustias
bears to the Caldera of Palma in the Canaries     ; and those two crater
like valleys,  as well as the Curral of Madeira, are believed to have
been shaped out in great part by running water.       But to render this
possible, the suspension, for a   long period, of the outpouring of lava
 on the eastern <U+FB02>ank of Etna must be assumed.
    The author fully coincides in the generally received opinion that
 the accessible parts of Etna are of subaérial origin, and refers to some
 fossil leaves presented to him by     MM. Gravina     and Tomabene,       of
 Catania, as well as to others collected by himself in situ, from the
 volcanic tu<U+FB02>'s  of Fasano and Licatia, which have been determined by
 Prof. Heer to belong to terrestrial plants, of the genera Myrtle,
 Laurel, and Pistachio, now living in Sicily. These tuffs, together with
 the general mass of Etna, repose on marine strata of the newer Pli
 ocene period,    in which 150 species of shells, nearly nine-tenths of
 them identical with species now existing in the Mediterranean, have
 been found.      A  very modern    marine  breccia, with shells   of living
 species extending to the height    of thirty feet on the coast along the
 eastern base    of Etna, was pointed out to the author by Signor G.
 G. Gemmellaro near Trezza, and in the Island of the Cyclops.           The

                                       i

   same formation has been      traced together with lithodomous        perfora
   tions by    Dr. Carlo Gemmellaro and Baron v. Waltershausen             along
   the sea-shore as far north as Taormina,      beyond the volcanic region
   of Etna.     From these and other data enlarged upon in the memoir,
   Sir C. Lyell concludes, <U+FB01>rst, that       a very  high antiquity must be
   assigned to the successive eruptions of Etna, each phase of its vol
  canic energy, as well as the excavation of the Val del Bove, having
   occupied a lapse    of ages compared to    which the historical period is
  brief and insigni<U+FB01>cant; and secondly, that the growth of the whole
  mountain      must nevertheless be referred,     geologically,   to the more
  modern part of the latest Tertiary epoch.

      A résumé    of the greater part of this paper has already appeared
           ‘
  in the     Proceedings’ for January 29, June       18, and November        26,
   l857.     The author has since examined the expansion by heat of
  wood cut across the grain, which, as well as that cut in the direction
  of the <U+FB01>bre, he <U+FB01>nds to       be increased by tension and decreased         by
                                     quantity of water has
'
  moisture.      When   a su<U+FB01>icient                              been absorbed
  the expansibility    by heat ceases, and wood is contracted        in each  di
  rection by rise of temperature.      Nevertheless,   when wood, saturated
  with water, is weighed in water of different temperatures, the result
  shows cubical expansion of the substance of the wood by heat. The
  inference drawn by the author from these facts is, that the contraction
  of the dimensions of wet wood is owing to the action of heat in di
  minishing the force of capillary attraction, and that thus the walls of
  the minute     cells and tubes of the woody structure       are  partially re
  lieved from a force which thrusts them asunder, a small quantity            of
  water exuding at the same time.          In the case of wet wood which
  contracts by heat, he <U+FB01>nds, in accordance with Professor Thomson's
  formula, that a rise    of temperature is produced by the application of
  tension.    In conformity with the deductions of the same philosopher,
  the author     has also been able to detect experimentally        the minute
  quantity    of heat absorbed, in bending or twisting an elastic spring,
  arising from the diminution of the elastic force of metals with a rise
  of temperature.

        By Professor WILLIAM THoMson, F.R.S., &c., being ex
        tract of two Letters to J. P. Joule, LL.D., F.R.S., dated
        February 2 and 3, 1858.                             Received             April 30, 1858.
    A   very novel application               of Carnot's cycle has just occurred to
me in consequence of looking this morning into Waterston's paper
on Capillary Attraction, in the January Number of the Philosophical
Magazine.    Let T be the contractile force of the surface (by which
in Dr. Thomas Young's theory the resultant                                         effect    of cohesion on
a   liquid mass of varying form is represented), so that,                                         if II       be the
atmospheric          pressure, the pressure of air within a bubble                                            of the
liquid of radius r, shall be                     4T +           II.       Then     if  a   bubble be blown

                                         of in

equal    to   2T.
    Now since liquids stand                  to   different heights                 in   capillary tubes                 at
different temperatures, and generally                                to   less heights                 the higher

temperatures,        T      must vary, and              in      general decrease,                      the tempe
rature rises, for one and the same liquid.                                       If T    and   T       denote the
values    of   the capillary tension              at    temperatures               t   and   t'   of    our abso

 IV.      “ 0n       the Logocyclic          curve, and the geometrical origin
        of Logarithms.”               By the Rev.      J. Boorn, LL.D., F.R.S.
        Received         April 15, 1858.
    In   a paper      read before the Mathematical Section of the             British
Association       during its meeting at Cheltenham             in 1856, and which
was printed         among the reports          for that year, I   developed at some
length     the geometrical origin           of logarithms, and showed that       a tri
gonometry exists as well for the parabola as for the circle, and that
every formula           in the latter may be translated         into another which
 shall indicate        some     property     of parabolic arcs analogous to that
 from which it has             been   derived.     I  showed, moreover,     that   the

                                            25?’
whole theory of logarithms was founded on                       a basis as      purely geo
metrical as the trigonometry of the circle, and                 I pointed     out how the
imaginary expressions in the latter-—such                 as  De Moivre’s theorem-—
have real counterparts in the trigonometry of the parabola.                            As the
principle of duality is of the widest application in geometrical investi
gation, and       as every    property of circumscribed          space has its dual,         it
would be strange         if the dual  of circular trigonometry had no existence.
     In  the paper to which        I have referred,      I showed    how, by the help
of certain arbitrary lines drawn about the parabola, numbers and their
logarithms might be exhibited.                 But     as there was something            con
ventional in this representation,            I  was not quite satis<U+FB01>ed with the
construction.          I suspected   that the geometrical theory           of logarithms
was    just as little conventional as            the trigonometry of the circle.
With this view I have again lately considered the whole subject, and
by the help of a new curve, which I have called the Logocyclic Curve,
 from the similarity of many of its properties to those of the circle,
and from its use in representing               numbers       and their logarithms,           I
 have succeeded in exhibiting the whole theory of logarithms in a
 geometrical form as complete as it is comprehensive,                    and simple         as
it is beautiful.
     The properties of the Logocyclic curve,                 a curve    which hitherto
 has escaped discussion,          if not  discovery,      are many of them as re
 markable      as   they are simple, and         I  will now proceed to mention
 some    of the most obvious.
                      The equations qf the Logocyclic curve.
     Let  r and   6  be the polar coordinates of the curve, then its equation
is

 Let the focus F of the parabola, whose vertical focal distance F0 is
 a, be taken     as the     origin, the axis and parameter of the parabola
 being the axes ‘of .z' and y; let the vertical tangent OT
                                                                                   and the
 directrix of the parabola DS be drawn, then the following proper
 ties  of this curve may easily        be shown      :
                                                                         'r   2

                                            258
   I.   The directrix DS of the parabola is an asymptote of the curve,
which has two infinite branches along this line above and below the
axis.    These branches intersect at right angles on the axis of the
parabola in      its   vertex, and form          an   oval   or   loop between this point
and the focus        of   the parabola     F.
   II.   The radius vector r=a(sec 6+tan 6), drawn from the focus                                 F
of   the parabola, cuts the loop and one                of   the infinite branches          in   the
points    R1   and   R,    so   that
               FR=     a(sec 6+tan 6), and            FR   =  a(sec      6-tan 6).
The product     the segments
                     of                     of   this secant,       as   in   the circle,   is   con
stant and equal   a”.     to
     These points may            be   named Reciprocal Points.

                                       259
    III. 0 being   the vertex of the parabola, in which the two branches
of the curve cut at right angles, the angle ROB’ is always               a  right
angle.
    IV.  Through the points      R   and    R, let normals     be drawn   to the
Logocyclic curve, they will meet the parabola in the same point Q,
and the parabolic arc OQ diminished by the protangent QT is the
logarithm of the number FR or of its reciprocal FR,.
    Q, the intersection on the parabola of the normals, drawn to the
Logocyclic curve at the reciprocal points-R,             R1 may be called     the
Logarithmic point of the line     FR.
    V. The   normals   RQ  and  R,Q are      equal.    This is also  a property
of the circle.
    VI. At   the points  R and R“ the reciprocal paints, let tangents
be drawn to the curve and meet in V.              The tangents RV and R,V
 are equal, and they are equally inclined to the chord           RBI.    This is
another property of the circle.
    VII.  The locus of V, the intersection         of tangents drawn to the
curve through the reciprocal points, is the Cissoid of Diocles, a curve
 discovered in the Schools of Alexandria.
    VIII.  Since  the line  VQ    is at right angles to the line        VO, we
 have this new property    of that old curve, that       a line drawn through
 any point  of a Cissoid at right angles to the radius vector drawn to
 the cusp of the curve envelopes a parabola.
    IX. The directrix of the parabola is the asymptote of the Cissoid,
 and its cusp is at O the vertex of the parabola.
    X. The    sum of the ordinates of the reciprocal points R and R1 is
equal to the ordinate of the logarithmic point Q on the parabola,
and the sum of the distances of the points R and RI from the
asymptote    DS is constant and equal to 2a.
    XI.  The sum of the products of the            abscissse  and ordinates    of
the reciprocal points on the curve is constant, or
                             "”4”u'l'.'/1?/n=“2'
    XII.  The distances of any point Q on a parabola from its focus
and directrix are equal.     We may generalize this well-known theo
rem, and say the distances are equal            of any point on     a parabola
from its Logocyclic curve, measured along the two normals to this
curve drawn through the point Q.

                                                260
           XIII.     As the tangent to     a parabola makes equal angles                   with the
    focal radius vector and a perpendicular                   on the directrix, so also
    this tangent makes equal angles with the normals to the Logocyclic
    curve drawn through this point of contact.
       XIV. The two reciprocal points R and R1 on the Logocyclic, the
    .logarithmic point Q on the parabola, and the intersection V of the
      tangents to the Logocyclic which meet on the Cissoid lie on the
    circumference         of   a circle,   or in other      words,        any two reciprocal
    points on the curve, the intersection of the normals                        at these        points
    and the intersection          of the tangents at the           same       points lie in the
    circumference         of a circle.
           XV. Through         the two reciprocal points
                                               and R1 a circle mayR
    be drawn touching the axis at O, and having its centre at T the
    intersection of the vertical           tangent    OT, with the radius vector F B‘.
    This property leads to a simple construction of the curve by points.
      XVI. The tangent to the curve at either of the reciprocal points
    makes with the radius vector through this point an angle whose tan
    gent is equal to the cosine of the inclination                 of the radius vector to
    the axis.
           XVII.      The sum of the polar subtangents             FC     and       FC, belonging
     to the reciprocal points R and R‘ is constant, and equal to 2a.
        XVIII. The sum of the reciprocals of the polar subnormals be
                                                                                       2
    longing to two reciprocal points is constant, and equal to‘;
           XIX.              of the tangents to the curve between any

     two reciprocal points and the asymptote are equal, or Rt=R,t,, and

           XXI. Let      p and p, be the reciprocals        of the radii of curvature of
     the Logocyclic curve at the points                 R   and     R,;       and let p” be the
     reciprocal        of the radius of curvature           of the parabola at              a    point
     through which the normal makes the angle                     ill   with the axis, then
                                                                          '

           XXII.      The Logocyclic curve         is   the envelope of all the circles
     whose centres range along the parabola, and whose radii are succes
     sively equal to 4/    f    2—a‘*,

circle from the focus of the parabola.  This follows from an inspec
tion of the figure; but it may easily be proved as an independent
theorem.
     XXIII.           The vertical tangent                 OT       bisects      all   the cords        of   the   Lo
gocyclic passing through                        F.     The angles             VRT        or    WRT=\!              and
6    or   OFR     are    so   connected that tan                W-cos         6.      Hence the maximum
ordinate         of   the loop       is      found        by   making         V-6,       or   tan 6=cos           6,   or

    The author states that the principal object of this memoir is to
 set forth two new methods of treating the dynamical equations by
 processes of variation of elements, differing from the ordinary pro
 cesses  of this nature principally in this particular, that the variations
 are  represented in explicit terms of the elements themselves and of
 the  time, and not through the medium of partial differential coeffi
 cients.    It has been his object to render the processes as elementary
 as  possible;    and to preserve them in a vigorous          form, by post
 poning all attempts at approximation until the formulae are actually
 applied to practical problems.       The applications    given in the paper
 comprise    the circular and spherical     pendulums,    and the, planetary
 and   lunar theories, and    a special   theorem    as to the movement     of
 the plane    of a planet's  motion    under the in<U+FB02>uence    of several other
 planets.

as representing motion in two planes inclined to each other at the
angle     I, and in ellipses having eccentricities       e, and e,,   it is shown
that, no matter how small or how large may be the disturbing force
produced on each orbit by the other planet, the aggregate amount of
disturbance of the planet m, is of the order of the quantities            I and  c2,

 the author concludes that the ordinary direct methods of solution
 by approximation, being based upon the erroneous assumption that
 the variations of the coordinates are of the order of the disturbing
 force, are not, in a mathematical         sense,  legitimate     processes;    and
 that, in the planetary theory, they produce            results practically true
 only on account of the minuteness of the disturbing forces, and the
 consequent      great length   of the secular periods; and that, in the
 lunar theory, their failure is made evident, in consequence of the
 comparatively large magnitude of the disturbing force, and the con
  sequent rapidity with which the elements          of the moon’s orbit pass
  through their secular periods.
     The formulae for the variations of the elements are then applied
  to the lunar      theory;   and some    of the integrations are effected
  by means of a lemma containing the solution of the di<U+FB02>'erential

     By this method, the total motion of the moon’s perigee,             as well as
  the coefficients    of the evection, are fully obtained         in the <U+FB01>rst in
  stance, without the necessity      of any second approximation; and the
  usual difficulty as to the movement of the perigee does not present
  itself.    The motion of the node, and the evection in latitude, are
  correctly obtained in     a similar manner.
     This part of the memoir is concluded by an extension of the
  general formulae for the tangential variation of elements to the case
  in which we suppose the constant p to become variable, the result
  being to add to each variation a term involving (in.
     The third part of the Paper contains the development                    of the

                                     270
method    of osculating variation, before brie<U+FB02>y described    ;  from which
are deduced the formulae for the osculating variations        of elliptic  ele
ments.     This method is capable of being applied to the planetary
and lunar theories, as well as that of tangential variation; but the
advantages of this method did not appear to be such as to justify
the actual expansion     of the formulae for these theories. The author,
however, shows that with reference to any system of three bodies,
the equations of motion        for each body naturally assume the form
                           x"+n’(x—‘X)=O, &c.
(being the system solved by this method) ; and that the X, Y, and
Z are absolutely the same for each of the three bodies.               This is
shown by demonstrating,       that at any given moment the three lines
which represent the direction of the force acting on each of the
three bodies all pass through the same point, which is denominated
the centre of force.     The coordinates of this common centre of force
are’

    The invariable plane of this system of three bodies is then found ;
and it is shown that the nodes of the three orbits upon this plane
 are always in a certain relative position, constituting a kind of tri
 angle of equilibrium about the centre of force; resulting, in the
 limiting  case where one     of the three bodies is in<U+FB01>nitely larger than
 the other two (or in what is denominated         the undisturbed    Problem
 of Three Bodies), in an exact opposition of the two nodes of the
 orbits of the latter two bodies upon the invariable plane of the
 system.
    The formulae for the osculating variation         of elements are then
 applied  to a system     of three bodies, of which     one possesses   a pre
 dominating magnitude, so far as is necessary to determine the move
 ment of the planes of the orbits     ; and it is readily shown that,     if we
 consider only the <U+FB01>rst order of the disturbing force, the inclination

                                                                      27]

stant; and that the two modes are always in opposition to each
other, and move with a uniform angular velocity round the inva
riable plane.

about a central predominant                                      body; and it is shown that the                                      ag

chemical         of the four bodies be compared, for while urea
               mature
exhibits the deportment of a base, and the saline character of
sulphocyanide of ammonium is so well defined, carbanilide and sul
phocarbanilide          are apparently perfectly indifferent substances.
   Nevertheless, on considering the difference                      of the chemical pro
perties   of urea and sulphocyanide of ammonium, and on recollecting
that the saline constitution of urea is much more hidden than that
of sulphocyanide           of ammonium, it appeared worth while to try
whether     the action of powerful             agents would not reveal a similar,

carbanilide and sulphocarbanilide              to the action        of agents capable of
fixing aniline (anhydrous phosphoric acid, chloride of zinc, and even

stance which        Idiscovered many years ago among the products of
decomposition       of oxamelanile”, while the latter furnishes a remark

the examination of sulphocyanide                           of phenyl.            This body, which is

1:135 density at 15°.5, and of a perfectly constant boiling-point at
222°C. under a pressure of 0"762. The odour is aromatic and
pungent; it distantly resembles that of mustard; the body in
question is in fact the mustard                      oil   of    the phenyl-series.

     This substance            is   the thiosinamine                of   the phenyl-series;              like the
 latter,   it    possesses the characters                  of   a   weak base.        I     have not been

acid.     It   forms,   however, compounds          with nitrate of silver and
bichloride of platinum.            The latter has the usual composition,

cyanide    of   phenyl  is  acted   upon by  a   great   number     of ammonias
with formation of bodies the composition of which is su<U+FB01>iciently
 pointed out by theory.
   The mode of producing cyanate and sulphocyanide of phenyl,
which    I have described in the preceding paragraphs, deserves some
notice, since the usual processes        suggested by the experience in the
methyl-, ethyl- andiamyl-series, such as distillation of sulpho
phenylates with cyanates and sulphocyanides, have altogether failed
in producing       the desired result.      The     same    reaction   may be of
 course applied      to tolylamine, cumylamine,        naphthylamine,      and all
 primary monamines.

    While engaged in       some    experiments on the action of bibromide
 of ethylene on ammonia,          a short  account of which         I  have lately
 communicated to the Royal Society *,          I  induced    Mr. Henry Bassett,
 then working in my laboratory, to study the deportment of the same
 bromide with aniline, a characteristic         representative of the class of
 primary monamines.          In the following     pages    I  propose to submit
 to the_Society     Mr. Bassett’s observations, together with the results
 of a series of experiments which I carried out myself after Mr. Bassett
 by circumstances had been prevented from a further continuation of
 the inquiry.
    A  mixture of    1 volume of the bibromide of ethylene and 2 volumes
                * Proceedings of the Royal Society, vol. ix. page 150.

                                                  278
of aniline, when exposed to the temperature of boiling water for an
hour or two, solidifies into a crystalline mass of more or less solidity.
This    massis chiefly hydrobromate of aniline; it contains, however,
in addition, three new organic bases, partly free, partly in the form
of hydrobromates.                These substances are formed in very different
quantities,—a beautiful crystalline body, difficultly soluble in alcohol,
being invariably the chief product of the reaction, while the two
other bases, the one solid but extremely soluble in alcohol, the other
likewise solid but quite insoluble in this liquid, are found to be                                pre
sent in much smaller proportions.
  The preparation, in                a state     of purity, of the principal product of
the reaction presents no difficulty.                         The solid        mass   obtained by
digesting bibromide              of ethylene and aniline in the stated propor
tions is mixed with water, and submitted to distillation, when any
bibromide left unchanged, together with some unaltered aniline, passes
over.        The residuary liquid is then mixed with                        a strong solution         of
potassa, which separates                all
                             the bases existing   hydrobromates          as                           in
the form of   semi-solid resin. This
                  a                     washed with water and then
                                                          is
again submitted            to   distillation with water, when, together with more
or                    an
               additional quantity
     less water,                    aniline distils. The residuary
                                                        of
mass, when treated with boiling (methylated) spirit, leaves the in
soluble base
                     as
                     a     white, flour-like         powder, while the other two bases
dissolve. On cooling, the solution deposits beautiful crystallization
                                                                  a
of white needles, while the more soluble base remains dissolved                                       in
the spirit.          The crystals are rather difficultly soluble                      in    alcohol;
two     or   three crystallizations from this solvent render them absolutely
pure.
     Thus obtained, the new                base, for which,       in   accordance with the            re
sults    of   analysis,I    propose the name ethylene-phenylamine,                         isa   snow
white, inodorous and tasteless crystalline compound,   nacreous lustre,        of
insoluble    water, soluble
                in              boiling, less
                                           in     cold alcohol,   so

in   ether.       The solutions            are   without action          on   vegetable      colours.
The substance dissolves readily                    in   hydrochloric,       sulphuric and nitric
acids, especially          on   gently heating the liquids, which                    on   cooling     de
posit well crystallized saline compounds.    The hydrochlorate yields
yellow precipitates with bichloride      platinum and terchloride

as the simplest molecular expression for this compound.
  This formula is confirmed by the analysis of the hydrochlorate
and of the platinum-salt, the preparation of which, on account of
their instability, requires some management.

  What is the constitution of this             new base?     This question could not
be answered     without further experiments,             on account        of the twofold
mature     of bibromide of ethylene.               In many   cases        this remarkable
compound       exhibits     the character of the hydrobromic         ether of a
biacid ethylene-alcohol,            of (C, H,)"Br, whilst in the majority of re
actions    it splits into hydrobromic acid and the bromide C, H, Br,

alcohol,    C, H, O, homologous to allylic alcohol.                  It   remained there
fore uncertain whether the new basic compound retained the original
molecule (C, H,)" replacing 2 equivs. of hydrogen, or the modified
molecule C, H, replacing 1 equiv. of hydrogen.   In other words, it
had to be established by further experiments, whether the base was

name of the substance has been selected.
     It   deserves      to be noticed, that there are already two other bases
known which             have exactly the same composition, the one obtained
by M. Natanson in the reaction of bichloride of ethylene upon aniline,
and described by him as acetylaniline, the other discovered by M.
Dusart among the derivatives of nitronaphtaline and designated as
phtalidine. It is only necessary superficially to glance at the descrip
tionof these bodies in order to see that they are essentially different
from ethylene-phenylamine.    The constitution of acetylaniline and
phtalidine        has not been experimentally fixed.                                     It     is probable that
Natanson's base contains the molecule C,                                      H, formerly called acetyl,
but for which the more appropriate term vinyl has lately been
proposed, while phtalidine probably derives from the hydrocarbon
styrol or     an isomeric body, so that the difference                                     in the constitution
of the three bodies would be expressed in the following formulae:—

A     repetition of this experiment in the ethyl-series has given perfectly
 similar results.           On account of the                  less powerful action              of iodide of
 ethyl, the reaction requires longer digestion.                                  The iodide formed            is
 less soluble in boiling              water than the corresponding                               methyl-com

      The action of iodide of methyl and ethyl upon ethylene-pheuyl
  amine, although different from what might have been anticipated’,
  nevertheless appears to <U+FB01>x in an unequivocal manner the state of
  substitution of this base.                It   is   obvious that ethylene-phenylamine                        no
  longer contains any replaceable hydrogen, and consequently that the

 the aniline.
    But how is the composition of the bodies formed by the action of
 iodide of methyl and ethyl to be interpreted?     Are they simply
 compounds          of the alcohol-iodides with 2 equivalents of ethylene-phe
 nylamine, analogous to the salts produced by the union of                                           1   equiv.
 iodide    of mercury with 2 equivs. of ammonia?
   Does not the existence of these bodies involve a further considera
 tion of the formula which has been assigned to ethylene-phenylamine?
 Does the formula               C, H, N          actually      of this
                                                              represent the molecule
 body, or is it not more correct to double that expression and to con
 sider the formula C, H, N, as a more appropriate representation of
this molecule?                Ethylene-phenylamine              would then be derived from 2
equivalents       of ammonia, it would be                   a diamine, and the hydrochlorate

had been discovered that chemists began                        to consider the formula
  .                                C20 H22 N2 02
as a more appropriate       expression for the molecule                    of quinine.
    Probably further examination of the salts of ethylene-phenylamine
—I retain this name for the present——will furnish saline compounds
corresponding to the methyl- and ethyl-derivatives, showing that this
base, like quinine, is capable of forming two groups of salts.
    It  deserves   to be noticed that the diammonic nature of ethylene
phenylamine       is also strongly marked by its deportment under the
in<U+FB02>uence of heat; for while all the mouammonic basic derivatives of
aniline    are volatile   without      decomposition,                 ethylene-phenylamine,
when submitted         to distillation,        is destroyed with reproduction                  of
aniline,    like the well-established           diamines belonging to this group,
melaniline, formyl-diphenylamine,                  &c.
    In describing the preparation of ethylene-phenylamine, it has                           been
mentioned that the action of bibromide of ethylene on aniline gives
rise at the same time to two other basic compounds.                                 These sub
stances,   which   are formed    in smaller quantity, differ in a very marked
manner from the principal product of the reactions. Their study is
 not yet completed, but        it may       even now be stated,                 that they have
 the same composition as ethylene-phenylamine                           itself.    One of these
 substances,    remarkable for its solubility in spirit, is capable of being
 converted into ethylene-phenylamine by a simple molecular change.
The relation in which         these      three isomeric bodies stand to each
 other is not yet <U+FB01>nally <U+FB01>xed by experiment.                         The idea     suggests itself
 that it may possibly be represented by the formulae—

     The result of these experiments led                       me to examine the             behaviour
of aniline under the influence of                  organic chlorides containing                       even a
larger number of chlorine equivalents.                          The      agent selected was the
body well known        by the name                 of bichloride of carbon, i.                   e.    tetra
chlorinetted      marsh-gas,       or chloroform,                  in which           the       residuary
equivalent of hydrogen is replaced by chlorine.
  Aniline and bichloride of carbon do not act upon each other at the
common temperature; at the temperature of boiling water a change
is perceptible, but    even after several days’ exposure the reaction                                      is
far from being complete.               On submitting,                   however, a mixture                 of
3'    parts by weight of aniline and                      1    part of bichloride           of    carbon,
both in the anhydrous state,              for      about thirty hours             to  a   temperature
of          C., the liquid will                               to   be
                                       or be
     170°                                      found                    converted into          a     black
mass, either soft and viscid,                  hard and brittle, according                        to   time
and temperature.
     This black   mass, which       adheres firmly                 to   the tubes       in   which the
reaction has been accomplished,                    isa    mixture       of   several bodies.            On
exhausting with water,        a   portion dissolves, while                   a   more      or   less solid
resin remains behind.
     The aqueous solution yields,              on    addition       of   potassa,      an    oily preci
pitate containing     a   considerable portion                     of   unchanged         aniline;         on
boiling this precipitate with dilute potassa                            in
                                                                        a     retort, the aniline
distils over, whilst      a   viscid      oil       remains behind, which gradually

                                       285
 solidifies   with a crystalline structure.      Washing with cold alcohol
and two or three crystallizations from boiling alcohol render this body
perfectly white and pure, a very soluble substance            of a magnificent
 crimson colour remaining in solution.
    The portion of the black      mass which is insoluble     in water dissolves
almost      entirely in dilute   hydrochloric    acid,  from which solution
it is reprecipitated by the alkalies in the form of an amorphous
pink or dingy precipitate soluble in alcohol with       a rich crimson colour.
The      greater    portion of  this body consists of the same        colouring
principle which accompanies the white crystalline substance.                 On
the other hand, considerable quantities          of this crystalline  body are
 occasionally present in the product insoluble in water.
    The crystalline body is insoluble in water, difficultly soluble in
 boiling alcohol, soluble in ether. From the hot alcoholic solution it
crystallizes     slowly on cooling in elongated four-sided plates, often
grouped      round a common centre; this substance is a well defined
base; it freely dissolves in acids, from which, on the addition of the
 alkalies, it is thrown down as a dazzling white precipitate.
    The analysis of this     new base has led to the expression
                                    C. H, N,         *
 a formula corroborated       by the  analysis of a fine, somewhat difficultly
 soluble hydrochlorate,
                                 C, H, N, HCl,
 which is obtained by dissolving an excess of the new base in hot
 diluted hydrochloric acid, when it crystallizes on cooling.
    A    further confirmation     was  furnished    by the examination     of a
 bright yellow platinum-salt,
      -                     C, H, N,     HCl, PtCl.
 Both the hydrochlorate and the platinum-salt           are extremely soluble
 in  an excess    of hydrochloric acid, which has therefore to be carefully
 avoided in their preparation.
    The phase of the action of bichloride of carbon          on aniline,  which
 gives rise to the formation        of the   new  base,  is expressed    by the
 equation
          6C, H, N+C, Cl, = C, H, N, HCl·H3(C, H, N, HCl).
 What is the constitution of the new body? It is obviously derived
 from 3 molecules of aniline from which 4 equivalents of hydrogen
 have been eliminated by the 4 equivalents of chlorine               in the   bi

                                                    286
 chloride, the carbon entering as a biatomic molecule into the complex
 atom.          The    new body would thus become a triamine,

It    is   however more probable that the carbon replaces                                    in     the form       of

 V1. “Researches on the Phosphorus-Bases.”                  By A. W. Hor
          MANN,  Ph.D., F.R.S. &c.           Received  May 28, 1858.
    In   a paper published      in the Transactions of the Royal Society, we
 (M. Cahours and myself) have given a detailed account of the pre
paration of the phosphorus-bases, and also an accurate description of
triethylphosphine,      the most characteristic     and accessible represent
ative of this class of compounds.
   The object of our joint inquiry          was chie<U+FB02>y to examine the phos
phorus-bases as a class, and to establish their analogy with the corre
sponding terms      of the nitrogen-series.     The deportment of the phos
phorus-bodies     in their relation to other compounds has as yet been
scarcely investigated.         For several months I have been engaged in
this study, which promises a rich harvest of results.            Most of the
experiments were made with triethylphosphine,             a substance  which,
in consequence of its convenient position in the system of organic
compounds, in consequence of the variety of its attachments, the
energy and precision of its action, and, lastly, the well-de<U+FB01>ned cha
racter of its compounds, will probably become an agent of predilec
tion in the hands of the chemist.
   It  is my intention to trace the history of this remarkable body in its
several directions   ; and for this purpose, in fact, a considerable amount
of material has    been already accumulated.       But since necessarily some
time must elapse before such an inquiry, which from the peculiar
character of the compound is often obstructed by unusual di<U+FB02>iculties,
can be     completed,    I   beg leave   to present my results in the same
measure     as the  inquiry advances, hoping that        at a later period   I
may be allowed to collect the scattered observations, and to lay them
in a more elaborated and digested form before the Society.
   Among the numerous reactions of triethylphosphine,            my attention
has been chie<U+FB02>y directed to the compounds which this body furnishes
when submitted to the action of organic chlorides,             bromides, and
iodides.
     I. Action qf Bibromide qf Ethylene          upon Triethylphosphine.
   In   the anhydrous condition the two bodies act even at the common
temperature with considerable power upon each other, a white cry
   v0L.    Ix.             i                                      x

   stalline substance    being immediately precipitated.         If the reaction be
   allowed to go on in the presence           of  a large volume     of anhydrous
   ether,  the deposition of the crystalline body is considerably retarded,
   unless the mixture, in an appropriate apparatus, be exposed to the
   temperature of boiling water.           After a short digestion, on distilling
   off the ether and the excess of bibromide, a crystalline cake is left in
   the retort, consisting of several bromides, the nature and the relative
   proportions    of which appear in       a great measure to depend upon the       _
   rapidity of the reaction.       I  have found     it most convenient to work
   with ethereal solutions     at the common temperature.
      The determination of the bromine in the crystalline body revealed
   at once the compound character of this substance, for it steadily
  diminished by dissolving the bromide in absolute alcohol, and repre
  cipitating   it partially by ether. By repeating this process four or
  <U+FB01>ve times,    a body of constant composition was obtained.
      The compound thus prepared          is a crystalline mass, without odour,
  extremely soluble in water, and          even  in absolute alcohol, but inso
  luble in anhydrous ether.         It exhibited    a  rather unexpected compo
  sition, for on analysis it was found to contain
                                    C2, H29 PBr2,
 and consequently to have been formed by the simple union of                1 equi
 valent    of triethylphosphine and        1 equivalent of bibromide of ethy
 lene,
                     C22 H2,  P+ C2 H2 Br2=       C22 H22, PBr2.
     The bromine in this compound exists in two perfectly different
 forms; addition of nitrate of silver precipitated only one-half of this
element as bromide of silver, while even by protracted ebullition the
second     half remained untouched.          The result changed, however, on,
digestion with freshly precipitated oxide of silver, when the whole of
the bromine separated at once in the form of bromide of silver.
     On adding to the solution of the bromide             an excess  of nitrate of
silver, <U+FB01>ltering off the bromide, and removing the excess of silver by
hydrochloric      acid, a corresponding chloride was obtained, from which
bichloride    of platinum precipitated a beautiful orange-yellow pla
tinum-salt.      In   a moderately diluted solution which had been pre
viously gently heated,      no immediate precipitate was produced;             but
on cooling, the same salt was deposited          in magni<U+FB01>cent    needles,  which

                                             289
could be recrystallized            from boiling water, or better from                       hydro
chloric acid.
  This     compound contained
                                 C, H, BrPCl, PtCl,
   A   difficultly soluble gold-salt, crystallizing from boiling water in
small     scales, was found to have the corresponding                       composition,
                                C, H,      BrPCl, AuCl,.
  Very different results were observed when the whole of the bromine
was removed by means of oxide of silver.       A powerfully alkaline
solution was thus obtained, which, converted into hydrochlorate, gave,
with bichloride of platinum,          a precipitate only after very considerable
evaporation.       The       precipitate    was likewise of a deep                    orange-red
colour; it readily dissolved in boiling water, from which it separated
on cooling in the form of well-defined octahedra having the compo

  The compound phosphonium                   of this bromide          possesses very            con
siderable stability, as is sufficiently         evinced by            its   deportment with
mitrate   of   silver, and    by   the formation     of   the platinum-               and   of   the
gold-salt.      All   my attempts, however,            to   separate          the base itself
have entirely failed.          Under the influence           of   oxide          of   silver,    the
bromide yields        an   alkaline solution possessing           all       the characters        of

   I have ascertained by experiment that the brominetted bromide is
by no means the only result of the action of bibromide of ethylene
on triethylphosphine,  although under favourable circumstances it
appears to be the chief product.   Invariably a portion of the bibro

 touched upon as an agent of research,               is instantaneously decomposed

    The reaction is     so violent that care must be taken to prevent the
 phosphorus-base from being in<U+FB02>amed.
    Triethylphosphine        is not less powerfully attacked by bisulphide of
 carbon; but the result          is different.      On mixing the two bodies in
 the anhydrous condition, they are               found to combine with explosive
 violence, a deep crimson-coloured               crystalline compound being pro
 duced.     This    substance      is obtained in better crystals         if   ethereal
 solutions, instead of the anhydrous              compounds, be employed.          The
 new body separates       in beautiful crimson lea<U+FB02>ets the moment the two
 solutions are mixed.          This phenomenon is so characteristic, that
ever since    it was  <U+FB01>rst noticed, it has served me as a valuable test for
the detection of even minute traces of triethylphosphine.                   A watch
glass, moistened with the liquid in which the phosphorus-base is sus
pected,   is held over a vessel containing bisulphide of carbon:                   the
vapourof this compound immediately causes the formation of a crimson
network of crystals,      if  the smallest quantity of triethylphosphine            be
present.     It  is necessary       that the base should be free; its saline
solutions are not affected           by bisulphide        of carbon;   the reaction,
however, immediately           appears      when the base is liberated by the
addition of an alkali.
   The new body produced by the action of bisulphide of carbon
upon triethylphosphine is insoluble in water, nearly insoluble in
ether, but soluble     in alcohol.         From boiling alcohol it      is deposited
on cooling     in crimson     needles,      somewhat similar to the crystals of

                                                    292
chromic acid as obtained by the action                 of sulphuric acid upon bi
chromate of potassium.                    The presence of bisulphide of carbon in
the alcohol considerably increases                        its   solvent power for the crimson
body.        The                                                         95°C;

decomposition.
     The crimson crystals appear                 to   have the character                 of  a    weak base;
they easily dissolve           in    concentrated hydrochloric acid,                             a   colourless

drying       becomes        dingy,    with indications              of   decomposition.                A   gold
salt    similarly obtained exhibits                     a       like deportment.                  Both salts
appeared but very little adapted for analysis.                                The alcoholic solution
of   the body       is    decomposed           by   nitrate         of   silver with formation                 of
sulphide       of  silver.

chemistry     we are acquainted    with   a compound closely allied in com
position and formation to the new compound.              Bisulphide of carbon,
when treated with an alcoholic solution of ammonia, furnishes, together
with_other products, a salt crystallized in long lemon-yellow needles,
which is known by the name of sulphocarbamate of ammonium.
    This compound,                            _
                              (H4 N)  H2 N, C2    S4,
when treated with diluted acids, is converted into an oily acid of but
little stability, sulphocarbamic acid:
                                   H H2 N,   C2 S4.
    If we  replace in this compound the hydrogen by ethyl, the nitrogen
by phosphorus,       in other words,    if we replace the ammonia by          tri
ethylphosphine,      we arrive at the composition     of the body which forms
the subject of this note.
    I have convinced myself experimentally that trimethylphosphine
exhibits with bisulphide of carbon a perfectly similar deportment.
The compound formed is likewise of a crimson colour, but of a some
what lighter tint; it is more volatile and more readily soluble in
alcohol than the corresponding ethyl-compound:             it is also somewhat
soluble in water.
    Triethylarsin is not altered by the addition of bisulphide of carbon ;
after some time, however, long needles are formed in the mixture of
the two bodies.        These needles    are probably an analogous arsenic
compound      :   I have not however examined them.              A    mixture  of
triethylstibin and bisulphide        of carbon     was preserved      for several
months, without undergoing any change.
VIII.      “ Contributions       towards     the    History of        the  Mon
       amines.” By A. W. HOFMANN,               Ph.D.,F.R.S.     820.   Received
       May 28, 1858.
    The progress of my experiments on the poly-ammonias and on the
phosphorus-bases, now and then involves the study of reactions
which     are   scarcely comprised    between     the boundary     lines of the
principal inquiries.      For the  sake  of perspicuity,   I beg leave to sub
mit the results of these studies separately to the Society.
        1.  Action of Bibromide of Ethylene         on Trimethylamine.
    The unexpected result obtained in the action of bibromide of ethyl

                                      294
 ene on triethylphosphine,     induced me to examine the deportment            of
 the tertiary amine-bases under the in<U+FB02>uence of the same agent.               As
 a characteristic representative of this class      I  have selected trimethyl
 amine, which may be readily procured in tolerable quantity and in a
 state of purity.
    On submitting trimethylamine to the action of bibromide of ethyl
 ene, phenomena are observed which            are perfectly     similar to those
 which   occur in the analogous experiment with triethylphosphine.
 On account of the volatility of the trimethylamine, I have never
 worked with the anhydrous base, but invariably either with aqueous
 or alcoholic solutions.     At the common temperature bibromide of
 ethylene is only gradually acted on by an aqueous solution of trime
thylamine.       Frequent   agitation    and contact for several        days are
 necessary   to complete the reaction;       addition of alcohol accelerates
 the process;    which may be still very considerably shortened by ex
 posure of the mixture in sealed vessels to       a   temperature of from 40°
 to 50°.    To exclude complication, it is desirable to avoid a higher
 temperature and to keep always the bromide in considerable excess.
    By adopting   these precautions, the mixture       of the two bodies is soon
 found to deposit    a white crystalline salt, the formation of which con
tinues until the liquid has assumed an acid reaction.             A considerable
quantity of this salt is dissolved in the water; it is therefore most
convenient to distil off the excess of bibromide of ethylene and to
evaporate the residuary liquid to dryness.              The dry saline     mass,
separated   from a slightly yellowish deliquescent substance by washing
with absolute alcohol and      once or twice recrystallized from the same
solvent, furnishes      magni<U+FB01>cent white needles,         extremely soluble in
water, readily soluble in boiling alcohol, much less so in cold alcohol,
and insoluble in ether.      This salt can    be boiled    with the <U+FB01>xed alka
lies without disengaging a trace of an alkaline vapour.            This deport
ment renders it easy to recognize the absence           of impurities.
    The composition of this      substance,     established by many deter
minations, is represented    by the formula
                                      C=

    This substance,    which presents itself as bromide of trimethyl-bro
methylene-ammonium, is formed by the simple union of 1 equivalent

                                           295
of bibromide of ethylene with 1 equivalent of the tertiary mon
amine.     A glance at the formula exhibits the perfect analogy of the
composition       of this compound with that of the bromide formed by
the action of bibromide of ethylene on triethylphosphine.                    The de
portment of the two          salts with  nitrate   and  with   oxide of silver is also
similar  in every respect.
   By treatment with nitrate of silver, the bromine not belonging to
the ammonium may be removed without affecting the bromine of
the radical.      The nitrate thus obtained, after separation of the excess
of silver, furnishes with bichloride of platinum a di<U+FB02>icultly soluble
octahedral salt, crystallizable         from a large quantity of boiling water,

    reactions.       I     have not, however, minutely examined the substances
    which are formed. They are su<U+FB01>iciently characterized by theory.
      The unexpected deportment of bibromide of ethylene with the
    tertiary monamines and monophosphines, furnishes a1 new proof                                      of

    If alcohol   be slowly oxidized       by nitric acid at ordinary tempera
 tures, besides other substances,       glyoxal, C2 H2 ()2, and glyoxylic acid,
 C2 H2 02*,   are formed.
    I have   continued the investigation        of  these  substances, and beg
 to lay before the Royal Society some of the more interesting results.
    Glyoxal, of the consistency of ordinary syrup, is mixed with about
 three times its bulk of strong ammonia, and the mixture kept for
 twenty minutes at a temperature from 60° to 80° C.                   The liquid

 precipitate,         which     I propose to call glycosine, and the other in
 solution, to which             in this paper the name of glyoxaline will be
 applied.   Besides these two substances, only a little formic acid and
 the excess of ammonia can be recognized in the liquid.
    Glycosine=C. H. N.                    The crystals contained in the ammoniacal
 liquid are collected on  a filter and washed with cold water.    By
 dissolving them in diluted hydrochloric acid, treating with charcoal
 and adding ammonia to the decolorized solution, the glycosine is
 obtained as a colourless, crystalline precipitate.  The crystals are
little prisms, tasteless, imodorous, and only soluble in a great quan
tity of boiling water. They become very electric when rubbed in a
mortar.    A little glycosine placed between two watch-glasses and
heated on a sand-bath, sublimes without leaving a residue, and                                      pro

length.          It
            forms salts with acids, which generally crystallize well.
The chloride has a great tendency to form double salts with the
chlorides of copper, mercury, and platinum.
     Chloroplatinate,          C, H,      N,+2(HCl Pt Cl),                forms a fine yellow
crystalline powder, soluble with difficulty in water. An excess of
water seems to abstract bichloride of platinum and hydrochloric
acid.  Glycosine is formed from ammonia and glyoxal according to
the equation—

X. “An Experimental Inquiry into              the alleged   Sugar-forming
       Function    of the Liver.”        By F. VV. PAVY, M.D.          Com
       municated by Dr. OWEN REES.               Received   May 26, 1858.
                                 (Abstract.)
    The author commenced by stating that the question to        be discussed
in his communication      was, not whether sugar was to be found       in the
animal system     independently of a saccharine alimentation, for that
he considered to stand upon irrefutable          ground; but whether the
sugar encountered in the liver after death was a natural representa
tion of the condition during life, or was only the result of a post
mortem    occurrence.     He had noticed       as early as February     1854,
that the blood removed by catheterism of the right ventricle during
life, was  almost completely       destitute of saccharine impregnation.
The observation did not then, however,             receive the attention    it
deserved; but on repeating the experiment at a later period, and
meeting with    a  similar result, an investigation was made which has
led to the conclusions advanced      in his communication.
    From upwards of sixty observations, it is asserted that the con
dition of the blood after death can no longer be taken as indicating
its state during    life.  For,  if blood be withdrawn       from the right
ventricle of the living animal in a natural or tranquil state, there is
scarcely an appreciable amount of sugar to be discovered, whilst,           if
the animal be afterwards sacri<U+FB01>ced and blood collected from a <U+FB01>ne in
cision of the ventricle, it will be found to present a strong indication
of the presence of sugar.       In  one  of the experiments quoted, there
was a barely appreciable reaction in the blood removed during life,
and nearly 1 per cent of sugar in the blood collected after ‘death,
the animal having been sacri<U+FB01>ced immediately after catheterism has
been performed.
    Observing this striking contrast in the blood abstracted from the
right ventricle before and after death, the possibility occurred that
there might be a corresponding contrast in the organ that was con
sidered tb be specially endowed with a sugar-forming function.           The
recent researches    of Bernard had taught      us that a material naturally
 existed in the liver which was extremely susceptible of conversion
 into sugar.   It was this material, in fact, which was looked upon as

                                         301
giving rise to the sugar thought            to be largely present in the liver
during life. At the outset of the inquiry, an agent was sought for
which would check the transformation of- the sugar-forming material
after death, and thus present the liver in a condition as near as pos
sible to that which existed during life.           Potash was found to possess
this   e<U+FB01>'ect  without destroying the principles concerned.            A strong
solution of it was then injected,       as instantly after death as practicable,
through the portal vein into the liver; and,           as the result, the organ
presented scarcely any appreciable trace of the presence of sugar.             A
liver similarly treated when it had          been  allowed to remain a short
period after death, gave the usual strong reaction of sugar that has
been hitherto noticed.          By injecting only    a part  of the organ with
the alkali,    it is most strikingly susceptible of demonstration, that
the presence of sugar is in reality due to a post mortem occurrence,
and can therefore be no longer looked upon as a representation of
the natural ante mortem condition.
    The sudden abstraction           of heat from the liver instantly after
death, leads to a     similar arrest of the production of sugar, and thus
enables us likewise        to represent the real condition        of the organ
belonging to life.       In   one   of the experiments mentioned, where a
dog was sacri<U+FB01>ced, and a          piece of the liver instantly sliced off and
thrown into a freezing mixture of ice and salt, the absence of sugar
 was almost complete;        the amount at least was so small, that it was
found impossible       to arrive at a quantitative       determination   with  a
 concentrated spirituous extract, notwithstanding           the process is sus
ceptible of so great a delicacy.          The portion of the liver which was
 not submitted to the action of cold, and which was allowed to remain
 a short time in the animal, yielded on analysis an indication of 2'96
 per cent.   of sugar.
    Division of the spinal cord in the lower part of the cervical region,
 the effects   of which have      been noticed    by Bernard, but differently
interpreted, leads to a corroboration          of the deductions drawn from
 the preceding experiments.           When the weather     is cold or moderate,
 the operation is followed       by a gradual reduction    of temperature; and
 if the animal    be sacri<U+FB01>ced when its body has cooled down to about
 70°, the   liver is found    free from sugar, upon an ordinary immediate
 examination, because at such a degree the post mortem transforma
 tion is not effected   with sufficient rapidity to lead to our deception.

                                        302
   Placed aside, however, it soon becomes strongly saccharine.            Should
   the operation   of division     of the cord        be   performed,    and   the
   temperature of the animal      be afterwards       maintained   at about the
   ordinary height   by exposure to external warmth, then the liver is
  as strongly saccharine upon ordinary examination             after death, as   if
  the animal had been taken and simply sacri<U+FB01>ced.
      By oiling the coats of rabbits and exposing them to cold, the
   temperature of the body falls, and precisely the same phenomena
   are noticed as after division   of the cord.
      With frogs in   a vigorous    condition,     the “presence or absence     of
  sugar in the liver submitted to the ordinary process of examination
  after death, is dependent upon the temperature of the animal at the
  time of the destruction   of life.   This fact     was independently noticed
  by myself about the time that it was mentioned by Bernard                  in a
  communication    to the Parisian       Academy       of Sciences.    Bernard’s
  interpretation of it is connected with the relative activity of the ab
  dominal circulation; but, for myself,        I  bring it forward as strongly
  supporting the views that have been advanced,           and consider it to be
  explained by the in<U+FB02>uence of temperature on the post mortem pro
  duction of sugar.
     The material which occasions the         presence    of sugar in the dead
 liver, has been called by Bernard           “Glucogenic matter,”--a term
 which, being only specially applicable after death, it is suggested
 should be abandoned, and replaced by Hepatine.
     The amount of hepatine in the liver of the dog is much greater
 under a vegetable than an animal diet. The amount is also increased
 by mixing sugar with animal food.            From the examples given, it is
 shown likewise that the relative.weight           of the liver presents   a pro
 portionate variation, according to the quantity of hepatine present.
 In eleven dogs taken indiscriminately, that had been restricted to
an animal diet, the weight      of the liver     was one-thirtieth   that of the
animal.     The average per-centage      of hepatine yielded by eight livers,
also taken indiscriminately       after an animal diet, was         6'97.    Five
instances have been collected of dogs restricted to a vegetable diet
for some days prior to death.         The average weight of the liver was
one-<U+FB01>fteenth    that of the animal.         In only three of the examples
was the actual amount     of hepatine determined, but in the other two
it  was noticed to be exceedingly large.            The average given by the

                                       303
three was l7'23 per cent.           Four dogs were placed upon an animal
diet,   and about a quarter of a pound of ordinary                   cane-sugar    ad
ministered daily for a short period.             The   average     weight given by
the   four livers  was one-sixteenth and a        half that of the animal, and
the average amount of hepatine yielded was               14".’) per cent.
    The natural destination of hepatine in the living body remains to
be determined.        It has also to be shown how it resists transforma
tion    into sugar during life, when it is           so   rapidly changed       at an
elevated temperature immediately after death.                   A possible analogy
may be presented by the following occurrence               :-When       a solution  of
hepatine,     in a neutral state,      is   placed in contact with saliva, an
almost instantaneous        transformation      into sugar takes place;         but if
a  little acid alkali or carbonated alkali        be added,      scarcely a trace of
change is for some time discoverable.
     Under normal       circumstances,       rarely  an appreciable       amount of
sugar is encountered in the circulatory system——0nly, according to my
analyses, from about ‘O47 to ‘O73 of a grain in 100 grains of de<U+FB01>
brinated right~ventricular       blood; and this would appear to result
rather from a simple escape of a small amount of hepatine from the
 tissue of the liver into the blood whilst circulating through the
 capillaries, than from a special functional operation of the organ; for
 when a disturbance of the circulation,           whether by congestion or the
 opposite, is occasioned, sugar makes its appearance to a considerable
 extent in the system, because          the admixture        of hepatine with the
 blood is favoured.       It  can be easily shown by experiment, that on
 introducing    hepatine into the circulatory         system, a saccharine state
 of the blood is induced,         and    if  enough     have been employed,          a
 strongly marked diabetic condition           of urine is established.
    Sacri<U+FB01>cing an animal and maintaining the circulation                by perform
 ing arti<U+FB01>cial respiration,      occasions a well-marked           diabetes.     With
 the   destruction   of life, the transformation          of hepatine into sugar
 takes place, and this, being carried away by the blood, is eliminated
 by the kidneys, and thus renders the urine strongly saccharine.
    Many phenomena which           were    before obscurely explained, receive
 a  lucid   interpretation    from   the new facts        which     have   now been
 brought to light.

XI. “On      the Properties of Electro-deposited           Antimony” (con
      tinued).    By   Gaonca         Golw,     Esq.     Communicated by
      Dr. TYNDALL.        Received June 1, 1858.
                                (Abstract.)
   In this paper the following additional information is given respect
ing this singular substance.
   The change observed in it      is shown      not to be an exercise of the
force of cohesion, because the amount of heat evolved by the powdered
metal is not sensibly different from that set free by the substance in
its coherent massive state.
                              _
   The thermic discharge is not limited to a particular temperature,
but commences between 170° and 190° Fahr., and increases in rapi
dity to some point above 212° Fahr., when it becomes sudden.
   The heat may    be discharged either suddenly or gradually,        accord
ing to the amount to be discharged in relation to the amount of
cooling in<U+FB02>uences present.
   The speci<U+FB01>c heat of the unchanged metal               was  found  to be=
0'06312; and of the       same   specimens, after being gradually          dis
charged, the speci<U+FB01>c heat was not sensibly different.           But the   spe
ci<U+FB01>c heat of the substance,      after sudden discharge, was found to
be=0'0543.
   The total amount of heat evolved by the              substance  during its
change was su<U+FB02>icient to raise the temperature of its own weight of
ordinary antimony (sp. heat=O'0508) about 650° Fahr.
   The evolution of vapour which generally occurs during the change
is a result of the molecular heat acting upon the terchloride of anti
mony contained in the substance.            It occurs when a sufficient tem
perature is produced either by internal or external causes, and does
not occur when the molecular discharge is gradual and the tempe
rature is not sufficiently raised   ;  in such   cases the weight of the sub
stance remains unaltered.
   The substance,   as usually produced from ordinary muriate         of anti
mony, or from a mixture of that substance and tartar-emetic, contains
small quantities of nearly all the ingredients and impurities of the
depositing liquid.

stance much more readily after the thermic discharge than before                                                   it.
     Differences        of   physical appearance were detected                                 in   the changed

the former were granular and less bright.                                      No mechanical mixture
could    be   detected        in    the changed powder.

       Assistant   Physician     and   Lecturer   on    Chemistry     to the
       Westminster Hospital.         Received   June 10, 1858.
                                 (Abstract .)
   Having formerly observed and communicated to the Société de
Biologie of Paris, that by heating a solution of neutral tribasic
phosphate of soda (2NaO . HO . P05) mixed with animal fatty acids,
an emulsion was obtained attended with the formation of a small
quantity of soap, while no such action occurred         if neutral  fats were
used instead of fatty acids,   I  was induced to inquire    into the nature
of the action of bile on neutral fats and fatty acids (sheep’s bile being
used), with the <U+FB01>nal object of throwing, if possible, some additional
light on the digestion of fats.      These investigations led to the fol
lowing results  :—
   1.  A  mixture of bile and neutral fats (stearine, oleine and marga
rine), heated to a temperature above the fusing-point         of the  fat, un
dergoes no change,    and no chemical action takes place.
   2.  A mixture of bile and fatty acids (stearic, oleic, and margaric
acids), heated to   a temperature above     the fusing-point     of the fatty
acids, is transformed into a solution, a very few and minute globules
only of fat remaining unacted upon from the presence           of oleic acid.
This solution   becomes  a perfect emulsion on cooling, and is attended
with a chemical decomposition of the bile; and further,         if the emul
sion of bile and fatty acids be <U+FB01>ltered when quite cold, and the residue
on the <U+FB01>lter thoroughly    washed with distilled water, the <U+FB01>ltrate and
washings mixed together again possess         the property of forming       an
emulsion with another quantity of fatty acids, being also at the same
time partly decomposed,     although in the previous operation the bile
appeared to have exhausted its power on the fatty acids.              The <U+FB01>l
trate and washings from this second           operation again act upon a
fresh quantity of fatty acids, and so on; only in every subsequent
operation the proportion     of emulsion obtained      appears  to diminish,
and the induced chemical decomposition to be lessened.
   3. Pure oleic acid, when agitated with bile, cold or hot, produces
no emulsion or chemical action whatever.
   4. The stomach during digestion has the power of decomposing

                                     307
the fats contained in the food into fatty acids, fats acquiring thereby
the property of being acted upon chemically by the bile, and of being
transformed into an emulsion.
    The chemical action, or saponi<U+FB01>cation, induced by the fatty acids
under the     above circumstances, was proved by the mixture acquiring
a strong acid reaction; and it     was further observed that the acid    <U+FB01>l
trate from the cold emulsion       was not precipitated   by hydrochloric
acid, showing apparently that fatty acids exert on bile         a chemical
decomposition     at least as extensive as hydrochloric acid.     With the
view of determining precisely the amount of        soap formed, a method
of analysis   was adopted calculated to indicate the proportion    of fatty
acid remaining unacted upon by the bile: the difference between the
fatty acids used and the result of the above operation was equal to
the weight of the fatty acids saponi<U+FB01>ed. It was found, in three ana
lyses, that the mixture of bile and fatty acids being exposed for three
hours (in Analysis II. for 3-} hours) to the heat of an open water-bath,
contained an amount of soap in which the proportion of fatty acids
was 30'21 per cent., 20'5 per cent., 11-5 per cent. of that employed
in the analysis. The <U+FB01>ltrate from the emulsion in analysis No. II.,
mixed with the solution obtained by washing the emulsion with di
stilled water,   was treated for three hours    on the water-bath with a
fresh quantity of fatty acids, which operation yielded a proportion of
fatty acid saponi<U+FB01>ed equal to 127 per cent. of that used in the ana
lysis.    Finally, the <U+FB01>ltrate and washings obtained in this last group
were mixed with another quantity of fatty acids, and exposed for three
hours to the heat of the water-bath, in which case the proportion of
fatty acid saponi<U+FB01>ed was equal to 3'8 per cent. of that used in the
analysis.    The various operations had    been attended  with the forma
tion  of an emulsion.
   In order to    be certain that,  after exposing a mixture of bile and
fatty acids to the heat of a water-bath for three hours, the chemical
action thus induced was completely         exhausted, two analyses were
undertaken according to the process just mentioned, and with bile
from the same gall-bladder; but in one operation the mixture was
heated   for three hours, and in the other for six hours: the propor
tion of fatty acid saponi<U+FB01>ed was the same in both cases, showing that
after three hours the bile had ceased to act on the fatty acids.
   Having obtained the     above results, an inquiry was next undertaken

                                                308
respecting the state of the fats of food in the stomach during diges
tion.     For this purpose the contents of the stomach of several dogs,
fed    with cooked meat and neutral sheep’s fat, were examined at dif
ferent stages of digestion;                the acids of the stomach soluble in water
were        removed by protracted washings with distilled water,                      and the
residue being treated with alcohol and ether, yielded solutions found
to contain fatty acids.              In    some cases the contents        of the stomach
were <U+FB01>rst treated with alcohol, and the fatty matters thus obtained
subsequently washed with distilled water, and <U+FB01>nally again dissolved
in alcohol and ether.               These analyses constantly yielded fatty acids,
which, when heated with fresh sheep’s                      bile, were found to dissolve
and produce an emulsion.
      In order    to determine whether the cooking               of   the meat with which
the dogs had been fed had transformed any of the neutral fats into
fatty acids,      a   sample of roast meat was mixed and washed with di
stilled water until the washings had completely lost their acid reac
tion    ;   the meat was then mixed with alcohol and allowed to stand for
more than        a    week.       After that time the <U+FB02>uid        was found to be per
fectly neutral, showing that no fatty acids had been formed.
      From     these researches       it    appears   that the presence of bile in the
intestines is closely connected with the digestion of fats.
   The results of recent investigations on excretine show that this
substance exists on an average in the proportion of O'460 grm. for
one evacuation when the excretine is impure, and of O'l84 grm.
when it is pure.          From       the careful examination of the             faeces   of   a
child one year old,           I   have ascertained that they invariably          contained
no excretine, but cholesterine;                 the proportion of the latter, puri<U+FB01>ed
by repeated crystallizations,               being equal to 0036 grm. in one eva
cuation, which number                is,   however,   a   very low estimate.         Nothing
in the food could account for this singular                     result.    It   is   therefore
most probable that excretine                  is   only present in the evacuations of
the full-grown         or adult individual.
 I      have been most ably aided in these investigations by my assist
ant,    Mr. Frederick Dupré, Ph.D.

XIII.     “ Further Remarks       on the Organo-metallic          Radicals, and
       Observations more particularly directed to the isolation of
       Mercuric,     Plumbic,     and Stannic       Ethyl.”        By Geoaon
       Bownuza BUoK'roN, Esq., F.R.S. Received June 17, 1858.
    Before again entering on the subject of the organo-metals, the
author    wishes to call attention to the remarks           he has previously
made* on the dif<U+FB01>culties which presented themselves at that time in
the    preparation    of mercuric      ethyl.   Secondary       decompositions,
induced     by the nature of the materials employed               and the high
temperature     necessary   to the reaction, showed themselves even in
 the more easily prepared mercuric methyl, and reduced the quantity
 obtained considerably below that pointed out by theory.
    The loss sustained in the similar operation of distilling together
 cyanide of potassium and iodide of mercurous ethyl, C, H5 Hg, I, is
yet more marked; and it may be remembered that the portion
obtained did no more than su<U+FB02>ice for           a  cursory examination of its
most marked characters.          A  new mode of operating was therefore
 desirable, and it was not long before the following              considerations
 presented themselves.
    The powerful and well-de<U+FB01>ned affinities of zinc-ethyl have already
furnished a valuable key to the explanation of several chemical
problems, and seem to be well suited for experiment in the present
case.    Bearing in mind its well-known reactions on water and hydro
chloric acid, there appeared to be well-grounded reasons for supposing
that interesting decompositions might be effected with various oxides,
 chlorides, and iodides.
    Through the instrumentality of zinc-ethyl the author has succeeded
in isolating, in a neat and efficient manner, several of the organo
metals, and he indulges a hope that they may, when taken as starting
 points  of investigation, prove of    service  in <U+FB01>xing     exact formulae   to
 some   of those bodies, the composition of which,          at present, appear
 doubtful from their complexity.

 so,   as   to   render     it   necessary              to   cool the apparatus                 in   water, and add
the well-dried              salt      by    degrees.            An     excess         of   the latter must                be
avoided, since chloride                     of    mercurous ethyl would                         be   formed,        as   was
formerly shown               to

     After the two bodies have been brought together                                                 in   their proper
proportions, heat             is    applied, and the radical passes over                                 by   distillation
as
a       heavy, colourless, and nearly inodorous                                  liquid; the slight                 excess
of   zinc-ethyl        is   then decomposed                      by   the addition           of      water, and just
sufficient dilute hydrochloric acid added                                        as   will dissolve the preci
pitated oxide          of    zinc.
     The two transformations may                                be   seen   in   the equations,
                            C,
                            H,          Zn-i-HgCl=C, H, Hg--Zn Cl,
and again,
                                 C.   H. Hg+Hg Cl=C, H, Hg, Cl.
The pure radical boils                       at   a   temperature between 158° and 160°                                   C.
It   burns readily, with                   a    luminous and somewhat smoky flame, with
disengagement               of     mercurial            vapour.         It     is   almost wholly insoluble
in   water.        Alcohol dissolves                  it     rather sparingly, but                 it     mixes freely
with ether.
     The behaviour               of   acids towards mercuric ethyl                         is   strictly analogous
to   that shown             by   mercuric methyl.
                                     With dilute acid there     but                                                 is
little change, but warm concentrated hydrochloric    sulphuric acid
liberates hydride                  of      ethyl      in     sufficient        quantity         to or   permit      of    its
inflammation through                        a     gas jet.            The salts         of      mercurous            ethyl
remain      in
          solution.
   The specific gravity                    ofa     specimen boiling between 158° and 160°C.
was found          to       be   2:444,           and the same sample when submitted                                      to
analysis, gave numbers agreeing accurately with the formula
                                                        C.   H. Hg.
The correctness              of    this formula was further confirmed                                     by   an   appeal
to   the vapour-density.
  The first experiment failed, from the circumstance that the vapour
decomposes with      slight explosion, when heated       few degrees
                              In a
                                                                                                     a
above 205°C.                          this experiment metallic mercury was deposited
on     the walls        of       the glass balloon                    as   a   grey film,            and the other
contents consisted                 of   an   inflammable gas.                    Mercuric methyl appears
therefore         to   be     resolved             at   this temperature into ethyl gas and
mercury.

                                                       3.11
     Another experiment                  was more successful, and gave the number
9.97 for the vapour-density.
     The equivalent weight of mercuric ethyl is 129, which, being
divided by the former figures, gives                             #      = 12.94.        If the constituents
of this radical          be condensed              into two volumes of vapour, the more
accurate number 14.86 should have been obtained.
     The theoretical density of mercuric ethyl, thus calculated, is equal
to   #= 8.68%.
  This portion of the subject would be incomplete unless a few
words were added on the behaviour of zinc-ethyl towards mercurous
chloride.
     It   has been mentioned, that                         all   attempts     to   reduce iodide        of   mer
curous methyl                                              radical containing            one equivalent              of
                                               of of
                         to   the form                 a
methyl and two equivalents   mercury have hitherto failed.
 Reasoning    priori, we should not expect
                      a                        find  departure                    to         a                       in
the present case, neither does such                                    appear.         Mercurous     chloride
reacts with vigour                  on   zinc-ethyl,             but     metallic mercury          is   formed
simultaneously with chloride                       of   zinc and mercuric ethyl.
     The decompositions                   of      mercurous             and      mercuric        chlorides           or
iodides, are thus shown:—
                    C,   H, Zn--Hg, Cl=C, H, Hg+ZnCl4-Hg,
and
                          C,   H,   Zn--Hg Cl=C, H, Hg--Zn Cl.
Having       succeeded,         by   these simple means,                   in    effecting   a   replacement
in   zinc-ethyl through the ordinary metallic chlorides, there remained
yet one point untouched, viz. the behaviour                                            of   various organo
metallic salts, under similar treatment.

        The Action    of Zinc-ethyl    on Iodide of Mercurous Ethyl.
   Carbonic acid, or ordinary coal-gas, was slowly passed through the
neck of a retort; and when the atmospheric air was displaced, about two
ounces   of zinc-ethyl, nearly   free from ether, and wholly so from iodide
of ethyl,   was introduced.     Iodide of mercurous ethyl was then added,
by degrees, through the tubulure, and the whole mixed by agitation.
The zinc-ethyl at <U+FB01>rst dissolves the iodide, but subsequently a cake
of iodide of zinc is formed.         Distillation was then commenced, the
heat being raised by degrees until gaseous products appeared.               The
distillate, after being well washed, was recti<U+FB01>ed by the thermometer,
and in this manner the radical was obtained in a state of purity.
Iodide of mercurous ethyl may be formed so easily by diffused day
light, and its action is      so gentle on zinc-ethyl,     that its use offers
greater conveniences to the operator than are afforded by any of the
substances    previously mentioned.
   For obvious     reasons, a similar choice     of materials is recommended
for preparing mercuric methyl.
                Action of Zinc-ethyl      on Chloride  of Lead.
   The    close relations which      exist between   the three metals, lead,
mercury, and silver, in their equivalent weights, salts,             and other
characters, lead the author to anticipate success            in forming    their
                                                                '
ethyl bases.
   The    existence   of the lead radical might indeed       be considered as
certain, since   various salts of complicated structure       have been made
known to chemists through           the experiments of     M. Lowig, on the
alloy of lead and sodium, under treatment with iodide of ethyl.
   The principal      product obtained by him, and the only one appa
rently analysed, had a grouping            similar to a sesquichloride.     The
formula ascribed by him to the radical plumbethylium            is Pb2 (C, H,,),.
 I have attempted to form the iodide of this radical by exposing
sealed tubes, containing      granulated lead and iodide of ethyl, to the
sun’s rays, but without       success.     No better result   was obtained by
substituting bromide of ethyl for the iodide, and no change could
be induced even when these           tubes were heated strongly with high
pressure steam.
   M. LiSwig’s method       was not resorted to, from the, supposition that
 the action of zinc-ethyl on a mixture would only give rise to radicals of

                                                              313
 various constitution,                 which             it might be impossible afterwards to
 separate, except by working on a large scale, which, considering the
costliness       of the materials, had                        its   disadvantages.                  Perhaps success
might attend the use                   of    one      of    Dr. Frankland's mirrors                        for   concen
trating the sun’s rays.
        For obtaining the lead-radical, recourse                                    was      had      to    well-dried
chloride        of
          lead, which was introduced into   flask containing zinc                  a
ethyl. The chloride immediately turned black, from the deposit
                                                                                                                         of of
metallic lead, whilst moderate heat was disengaged.                                                   An      excess
chloride was             used,      and the mass                    incorporated               by   stirring with         a
glass rod.    After applying      gentle heat for   few minutes, the
                                                      a                                  a
floating clear liquid was pipetted off. This substance    apparently                                 is
a  compound           of
                  zinc-ethyl and the lead radicals.    fumes slightly                          It
        the air, and         no   digestion with chloride                     of   lead appeared
it in
                                                                                                              to   resolve
        entirely into the lead base.
        A   great part       of   the zinc-ethyl, however,                     is   removed           by   subsequent
 distillation; but the temperature should not     permitted     rise                      be                       to
 above 140° or 150°C.     The substance   the retort   then treated       in                        is
 with water and dilute hydrochloric acid, when the radical                                                  separates,
and sinks        in   the form         of   colourless drops.        When distilled cautiously,
the thermometer soon rises                          to   200°, but beyond this point the vapour
is      very prone       to   decomposition, with deposit                           of   metallic lead.
   From this tendency  change, there  some difficulty
                                        to             obtaining         is                              in
the substance wholly pure from bodies with lower boiling-points.
The larger portion                  came        over between 198°                      to   202°.          Its specific
gravity was found                 to   be   1:55.
        Analysis led      to      the formula
                                    Pb      C,      H,        or   Pb (C,     H.),
        It   should, however,             be    noticed that              a   trifling      excess       in   the       per
centage        of   carbon obtained, showed                         an   increase rather than              a   decrease
in      the number       of    equivalents               of   ethyl.
        This radical, for which the provisional name                                      of   plumbic bis-ethyl
        suggested,             colourless fluid, possessing little     odour.                   or    no                 It

                          a

readily with         a   beautiful orange-coloured flame, edged with blue, and
gives off fumes              of
                                            to of
                                  oxide             lead.
        The radical appears                          be   incapable        of   forming             salts without        a

                                      314
 partial   decomposition.     With weak acids there is no perceptible
 action; but when they      are concentrated and gently heated, a gas      is
 given off, and crystalline salts are produced.
    The chloride is insoluble in water, but soluble in alcohol and in
 ether, from which last liquid it crystallizes in satiny needles, which are
 very volatile and provoke sneezing and lachrymation.          It burns with
 the characteristic lead flame, and by long digestion with concentrated
 hydrochloric acid, is converted into chloride of lead and volatile
 products.
    The sulphate also appears as a crystalline mass when plumbic-bis
 ethyl is gently warmed with a few drops of concentrated sulphuric
 acid.    It is conveniently    prepared by agitating the materials in a
 stoppered bottle, an exit being made from time to time for the gas
 which is liberated.
    Both these salts require analyses to fix their composition,          the
 details of which the author hopes shortly to be able to communicate.
             The Action   of Zinc-ethyl on Chloride of Silver.
   These substances     react with some violence, and a black substance
sinks in the liquid, which proved to be a mixture           of chloride and
metallic silver.    The zinc-ethyl   seems partly to escape decomposition,
even when the chloride is      in excess and considerable heat is applied.
On the addition of    water, effervescence sets in, and chloride of zinc
is alone found in solution.
   In  another experiment dry ether was employed instead           of water,
under a supposition that a solid compound might be formed, soluble
in that menstruum.        The only reaction, however, appeared to         be
that expressed by the equation,
                  C, H,  Zn-HAgCl=ZnCl--Ag+C, H.
A  similar negative result was obtained when zinc-ethyl was made to
react on protochloride      of platinum, PtCl.      The action is violent,
and the platinum is thrown down in the form         of platinum-black.
   The   same   remark also applies to protochloride of copper, Cu, Cl,
when similarly treated; no combination of copper and ethyl could
be thereby eliminated.

                 Action of Zinc-ethyl               on    Iodide of Stan-ethyl.
  This iodide, C. H. Sn, I, was readily obtained by heating sealed
tubes containing excess of tinfoil and iodide of ethyl from 150° to
160° C. The pure transparent crystals which were obtained by a
little management, were introduced, in a melted                                    state,     into a retort
containing       zinc-ethyl.         It    is necessary           to cool the apparatus with
water.   After breaking up the resulting mass, the retort was heated
until the thermometer marked 210°C., and the distillate, which con
tained a slight excess of zinc-ethyl, was agitated with water, and
treated with dilute acid, as before described.
    The resulting heavy liquid was again distilled, and fractionized
with the thermometer.                 By far the larger portion                    came over between
170° and 180° as a clear and colourless body, insoluble in water, but
soluble, like the other radicals, in ether. That section which pos
sessed   a boiling-point             between 176° and 180° C., was taken for
examination, and was found, when burned with oxide                                          of copper, to
give the formula

This compound, for which the name stannic bis-ethyl is proposed, has
a specific gravity of 1: 192. In                         its
                                    external and more prominent
characters          resembles plumbic bis-ethyl; but                              an   exception may         be
made, that      it it
                    is    more stable.          It     is   very combustible, burning with
a   coloured flame and scintillation like that exhibited                                 by   the metal tin
under the flame           of   the hydro-oxygen blowpipe.

organo-metal            stam-ethyl,           H,   Sn, obtained              by   Dr. Frankland              by
acting     on   sheet-zinc with           a    salt    of      stan-ethyl.         This last body            is
described
                as
                a       thick, oily substance,              possessed         of   a    powerful odour,
and having       a      specific gravity        of    1:55.        It   differs also          in    its   lower
boiling-point, which  about 150°is                       C.

pungent odour, and when heated,                        a    vapour which painfully                   attacks
the skin    of   the face, and produces fits                    of   sneezing.

     A   corresponding         bromide is formed when bromine is added to

When acted upon by ammonia,                       an oxide is precipitated, which                 with
acids forms beautiful crystallizable salts, readily soluble in water.
     A   complete history          of    these    salts, and their decompositions with
zinc-ethyl,      will   possess      much interest, and may prove of value in
referring to a few simple                   radicals the numerous complex                       bodies
described by Löwig, &c.
     The author is at present engaged on this branch of the inquiry,
a detailed account of which he hopes to embody in a communication
to the Royal Society, the present paper being intended only as an
outline to be hereafter filled in.
     In conclusion, the author would remark that                              a rich     harvest can
scarcely fail to be reaped, from submitting to the action of zinc-ethyl
the metallic compounds of other groups, such as arsenic, bismuth,
and antimony.

         M.D. &c. Communicated by Professor STOKEs, Sec. R.S.
         Received       June 17, 1858.
     Since the author              had the honour              of presenting to the Royal
Society his paper entitled “Researches                         on the Cinchona Alkaloids,”
Parts     I.   and   II.,   he has been much occupied with a continuation                            of
the subject, and he has arrived at important results, which, although
in an unfinished state, he hastens to lay before the scientific world,
in order to assure himself of the priority of discovery.
  Having had occasion to make some experiments upon the rotatory
power of the B-quinidin mentioned in the first part of his paper, he
arrived at the conclusion that some other feebly dextro-gyrate                                   alka
loid accompanied             it,   and    ofa     more soluble and less crystallizable
character.           Consequently,         on    its

the author obtained                      an   iodo-sulphate very different from that which
 he     has described               as   indicative          of     the quinidin               of    Pasteur: having
pursued this inquiry,

according               to   the manner         in   which         it   treated.
                                                                         is
        1st.    When          a   dilute solution            of     the acid sulphate                      of    quinidin       is

mixed with one-third or one-half its bulk of recti<U+FB01>ed spirit and raised
to 160° or 180°, then treated with tincture of iodine in small quan
tities, the red iodo-sulphate is produced, having the characters pre
viously described as indicative of quinidin,—quinine,                     when similarly
treated, invariably producing the optical salt.
  The only precaution            necessary    to be taken           in the   case       of the
alkaloid    quinidin      is to avoid adding an excess of iodine                    ;    other
wise an amorphous resinoid substance                    is deposited which will not
crystallize.
   2ndly.      But when                        of quinidin in a concen
                            we treat the acid sulphate
trated form, diluted with from thirty to forty times its bulk of rec
ti<U+FB01>ed spirit at a temperature from rather below 120° F., with the tinc
ture of iodine, even in greater proportions, an optical salt of quinidin
is produced, being the perfect analogue                 of the quinine salt.
   It   crystallizes from this strong spirituous solution as acicular long
lanceolate prisms, the form of which appears to be a rhomboid having
30° for the acute and 150° as the obtuse angles; but they are more
frequently      found     with    a   termination       like the blade of an ordi
nary bleeding-lancet.            These prisms have            a   frequent disposition to
hemitropism, but in superposition, so that two plates may he often
found overlying each other in a parallel position, wholly obstructing
light in those portions where they cover each other, but transmitting
an olive- or yellowish-green tint where separate.
   Sometimes the terminal planes              are rectangular.           This imbricated
mode of crystallization is very peculiar; and although the author has
made thousands          of experiments with quinine, yet he never saw any
thing similar     to   it ; for this alkaloid invariably crystallizes from ulilu te
alcoholic solutions as the a-prism,           obstructing light when the length
is perpendicular to the plane of re<U+FB02>ected light polarized in a vertical
plane,-—0r from strong alcoholic solutions, where the spirit is about
two-thirds the bulk, as B-prisms, which obstruct light in the opposite
plane, or, as the author has described                  it,   when the planes           of their
length     “lie in   a   plane parallel to that of the polarized beam                      with
which they are examined.”               In the   case   of quinine,     these two sets        of
prisms never occur together;    but     made     if               by
                                                   separate operations
and then arti<U+FB01>cially mixed on the same slide, they present the optical
characters of this new quinidin salt, viz. obstructing light when two
long prisms overlie each other in         a  parallel position.           They   are there

                                                              319

holic solution.
  The more frequent form in which this salt shows itself, however, is
as the a-prism, from solutions                            in which the alcohol is vastly predomi
nant over the water; whereas with quinine, 3-prisms always develope
themselves under similar circumstances (vide ‘Proceedings, vol. vi.).
This new quinidin salt has a very great similarity in                                               its   optical           pro

they strongly polarize light, and differ materially from the garnet-red
iodo-sulphate              previously described,                    by   the greater intensity                         of   their
optical properties.
 -When             we    attempt     to   purify the optical thin prisms                             by       recrystalli
zation from alcohol, the same modification appears                                              to       be   produced;
but the crystals are acicular rhombic prisms; the optical charac

    5th. The modi<U+FB01>cation which it undergoes by resolution or recry
stallization, and the formation of        a salt more resembling the garnet
red iodo-sulphate, but having strongly marked di<U+FB02>erential characters
 from this beautiful salt, viz. its strong tourmaline powers of absorp
 tion and its deeper colour, being nearly          a brown-purple,    and by its
 disposition to assume the rhombohedric form.
    The author     has not yet analysed this salt, but hopes ere long to
 accomplish     this matter and communicate his results to the Royal
 Society;    but he ventures to hope that it will be found to contain 2
 atoms sulphuric acid and 3 atoms iodine, like the analogous quinine
and cinchonidin salts.
    The author      has   also  assured  himself that there is an analogous
class    of salts produced by ethyle-quinine and ethyle-quinidin, but
optically distinct from those of quinine and quinidin.           He has already
produced three salts from ethyle-quinine,            having optical characters
different from any previously described.
    lst.  A  deep purple-red     salt by transmitted    light, in thicker plates
or aciculee quite impervious to light.         This salt occurs  as very slender
acicular prisms; it has a brilliant metallic-green           re<U+FB02>ected tint, but
very little double absorption.
    2nd. There is      a foliaceous salt, having a plate-like form, a deep
red or orange-red colour, transmitting an orange-yellow, having only
slight optical powers.
    3rd.   A  salt having many of the characters of the new quinidin
salt when <U+FB01>rst produced, viz. the optical characters and the on-form            ;
but on attempting to recrystallize it, the orange-red plates just de
scribed are alone produced.
    The only salt yet produced from ethyle-quinidin is one very similar
to the red salt described above, but it has only been very partially
examined.       The iodide ethyle-quinidin is      a  very beautiful silky salt,
less soluble than the iodide ethyle-quinine.           The author is not aware
that it has yet been described.           It  is readily made by mixing       an
alcoholic    solution of quinidin      with an etherial solution of iodide
ethyle;    on repose, the new iodide ethyle-quinidin         separates  in long,
slender, silky aciculae;       and further     crops can be repeatedly pro
duced by diluting the original solution with water until precipitation
 begins to follow    ;  on long repose, the iodide crystallizes and may be
 removed by <U+FB01>ltration, and washed with dilute spirit.

                                        321
   Note.—In reference to the rotatory power of the cinchona alkaloids,
the calculation      of the molecular rotation     gives an excellent plan      of
deciding on the purity of the alkaloid employed ; for if the absolute
molecular rotation be obtained precisely identical with those given
by other optical chemists, the purity may be inferred as proved.
But it is possible for a large quantity of two alkaloids to be present
in solution, one dextro-, the other levo-gyrate, and in such propor
tions that the polariscope shall give no indication of the presence            of
either.
   Thus   a highly concentrated solution of the acid sulphate of quinine,
marking a left-handed rotation of        57°\,    was mixed   with rather more
than double its bulk of a similar solution of quinidin marking 24°                -
The resultant solution      gave no rotation at all, the one affect perfectly
neutralizing the other.
   In experimenting upon non-<U+FB02>uorescent solutions of quinine or qui
nidin in the polariscope, it was found that these solutions were still
possessed    of their original molecular rotation upon plane-polarized
light, even undiminished, if care were taken not to dilute the <U+FB02>uid
when destroying the <U+FB02>uorescence by the soluble chloride, &c., which
was always done by adding         it in the solid  state.

   Dans la    1è‘re  partie de ces recherches j’ai étudié l’in<U+FB02>uence          des
extra-courants      induits  sur le <U+FB01>l même       de  la spirale d’un électro
aimant, sur les propriétés électro-magnétiques            et électrolytiques   du
courant qui met la spirale en action.          Cette in<U+FB02>uence intervient né
cessairement dans le jeu des moteurs électro-magnétiques, et la re
cherche de la corrélation des forces présentée par un de ces moteurs
ne   pourrait  être complète     sans pouvoir     déterminer rigoureusement
la quantité d’action chimique qui         a lieu dans la pile.     Voici  les ré
sultats que j’ai établi par des expériences exactes.
    1°. Dans les expériences faites sans avoir les bobines de l’électro
aimant dans le circuit, la force électro-magnétique             du courant est
                                                                 z2

                                             322
approximativement la même quelque soit le nombre des interruptions,
tandis que les quantités des produits                 électrolytiques      sont propor
 tionnelles    in  la durée de l’expérience       ; mes résultats, d’aecord avec les
lois   des courants électriques en général, font voir une petite différence
 entre Phydrogène           du voltamètre et celui calculé sur le poids du
 cuivre, qui par sa constance ne paraît pas être due à une erreur d’ex
 périence.
     2°. Lorsque les bobines de Pélectro-aimant entrent dans le circuit,
 la force électro-magnétique du même courant et les produits électro
 lytiques deviennent beaucoup moindres, et cela proportionnellement
 à la vitesse de rotation du commutateur, ou au nombre des interrup
 tions dans        un temps donné.           En comparant les résultats obtenus
 avec les mêmes vitesses            du commutateur,        avec et sans bobines, on
 trouve que la force électro-magnétique sou<U+FB01>re une diminution                        plus
 grande que son           action électrolytique,       et  que    ces différences sont
 d’autant plus marquées            que la vitesse     de rotation     du commutateur
 est plus grande.
     3°. Avec       les bobines dans le circuit, la quantité (Phydrogène du
 voltamètre n’est plus équivalente              à la quantité de cuivre déposé sur
 les lames de         platine de la pile      ;  Phydrogène       obtenu est d’autant
 moindre que le nombre des interruptions                  du circuit est plus grand.

     4°.  En tenant fermé le circuit          des bobines induites, la force électro
 magnétique et les produits électrolytiques augmentent, et à mesure
 qu’on diminue la vitesse de rotation du commutateur, le courant tend
 à se rapprocher au courant obtenu dans le circuit sans les bobines*.
     Dans la      2ième  partie de ces recherches        j'ai étudié un     cas présenté
 par un moteur électro-magnétique dont les électro-aimants sont formés
 de    deux bobines superposées.               Voici l’expérience principale.           Je
 suppose      de faire passer       un courant dans une des bobines;              lorsque
 Paxe des armatures a pris une vitesse uniforme de rotation, on réunit
 les deux bouts de la seconde bobine, et au même moment on voit l’axe
 de la machine s’arrêter, ou ne tourner plus que très-lentement.                       En
 même temps les étincelles qui avaient               eu lieu à chaque interruption
  du commutateur sont devenues à peine visibles.                    En ouvrant le cir
     * Déjà en 1854            sur l'induction,       11 et 3l),

cuit   de la spirale induite les étincelles reparaissent et l'axe de la ma
chine reprend sa vitesse            primitive.             On peut varier l’expérience           en
ayant adapté un tambour de bois à l’axe de la machine de manière à
obtenir    Pélévation d'un poids.                   Je   suppose qu’on ait déterminé le
poids que la machine peut élever avec une certaine vitesse lorsque la
spirale induite est ouverte:               au moment où cette spirale est fermée,                 il
faut pour faire tourner la machine avec la même vitesse, substituer un
poids beaucoup plus petit au premier.                           En partant   de ce résultat on
comprend facilement comment on doit faire l’expérience pour déter
miner Péquivalent mécanique de la chaleur. Il s’agit de mesurer le
travail mécanique de la machine dans les deux cas, c’est à dire, à
spirale induite ouverte et à spirale induite fermée, et de comparer la
différence des deux nombres à la quantité totale de chaleur développée
par les courants induits.             Voici         les nombres trouvés dans une expé
rience dans laquelle      j’ai obtenu               le maximum des différences entre le
travail mécanique de la machine à spirale induite ouverte et le travail
de la machine à spirale induite fermée.                         Dans le premier cas la ma
chine a soulevé un poids de 473 grammes avec la vitesse                                 du 58 se
condes pour      l0 mètres.         La spirale induite étant             fermée, le poids sou
levé avec la même vitesse était reduit à 7 l grammes.                             La différence
de    0'402 kilogr. multipliée             par 189 mètres d’élévation représente la
différence cherchée, qui est égale à 75'98 kilogr. mètres, et qui doit
être équivalente    à.   173'086 unités de chaleur développées par les cou
rants induits.     On tire de        là.   pour l’équivalent mécanique de la chaleur
le    nombre   438'96,        qui    s’accorde suffisamment                avec   les    nombres
trouvés par d’autres observateurs dans des conditions bien différentes.
Cette détermination fondée sur une expérience très-simple conduirait
à   des résultats rigoureux         et constants           si   le   dérangement du commu
tateur n’altérait pas la marche de                    la   machine.       Pour concevoir     ces
variations dans la marche de                la   machine qui dépendent de l’altération
du commutateur       il    faut      se     rappeler        que      la force d’une machine
électro-magnétique        dépend de            la   durée du contact et du moment de
l’interruption du commutateur.     Ainsi pour obtenir la plus grande
vitesse   faut que
         il          circuit s’ouvre au moment que l'armature qui
                         le
est attirée arrive tout près du bord                       de l’électro-aimant,     ce qui fait
que    la machine peut        se    mouvoir          indifféremment       dans    les deux sens
suivant l’impulsion      primitive.         J       ‘ai trouvé que dans cette position           la
diminution     de la vitesse due           à   l’in<U+FB02>uence        des courants induits      est   la

                                       324
moindre possible.       La diiférence augmente       à mesure   que par la posi
tion donnée au commutateur on laisse persister Paimantation                 pour
plus longtemps en présence de Parmature attirée,            ce  qui produit une
diminution    dans la force de la machine.           J’ai pu   de cette manière
parvenir au maximum du travail mécanique à spirale induite ouverte
et à spirale induite    fermée.     Cela nous aide à expliquer la manière
d’agir des courants induits        pour produire la diminution         du travail
mécanique de la machine.           En effet dans la position du commutateur
qui donne la plus grande différence          on conçoit que pour peu que le
contact et Paimantation       se  prolongent, les armatures se <U+FB01>xent et la
machine cesse de marcher.           Or l’action   de la spirale induite fermée
produit   nécessairement     deux effets     qui tendent à ralleutir     la dés
aimantation:     le premier c’est Paugmentation          du courant de la pile,
et par conséquent la force magnétique plus grande et plus persistante
des électro-aimants     ; le second effet de l’induction c’est de neutraliser
l’extra-courant    négatif quicertainement         rend plus prompte la dés
aimantation.
    En<U+FB01>n,   ce qui rendrait    ces  expériences    rigoureuses serait la déter
mination avec des calorimètres distincts de la quantité totale de la
chaleur développée      en même temps par la pile et dans les spirales de
l’électro-aimant, le circuit induit étant tantôt ouvert tantôt fermée.

     MY DEAR SIR,——In your work            on
                                              ‘
                                                Pendulum Experiments,’        and
 subsequently in     :1 paper printed     in the ‘Philosophical       Magazine’
 for  April  1846,  you have directed attention to the in<U+FB02>uence of the
 Gulf-stream    on the winters of the British Islands.           You have    been
 led to attribute the remarkably         mild winters which       we sometimes
 experience,   to an abnormal extension         of the warm waters of that
 stream towards our latitudes.         In this view     I  entirely concur, and
 beg to submit the following additional         proof of its correctness.
     An abnormal extension of the Gulf-stream in the direction of              the

                                                       325
British Isles necessarily implies that the waters bathing our                                             coasts
acquire a temperature which exceeds their mean temperature for the
season of the year at which the extension takes place. The tempe
rature of the air over the sea, and finally of the air over the islands,
becomes sensibly increased.                      The entire temperature at any point
will thus depend chiefly            on what              it gains from sunshine, and from
the warm sea-air, and on what                     it   loses by radiation.                If the excess       of
                                                                      of by
what it    gains from sunshine over                    its   losses           radiation    be   considerable
compared      to   its gain from the influence                            the sea, the temperature
will depend principally             on      the latitude.                 If,    on   the contrary,          the
thermal influence         of   the sea          be   very considerable, places                   at   different
latitudes    may possess         nearly equal temperatures.                               It    follows that
during cold winters            we should               expect       a   greater difference between
the temperatures          of   the southern coasts                  of   Great Britain and Ireland,
and the remainder          of   their    coasts, than               during mild winters.               It   also
follows,    that during warm winters                             the difference           of    temperature
                                        be on
between stations situated                       coast and inland stations having nearly
the same latitude, should                       greater than during cold winters.
  Although    I     have not yet finished                     all   the calculations necessary for
the complete illustration          of     these conclusions,              I      have been enabled             to
show that during some recent winters the observed                                      results    as   to   tem
perature entirely conform           to          these laws.
  The mildness        of   the winter which has just passed away, has been
universally remarked, and            Mr. Glaisher's returns for the meteorology
ofEngland and Scotland during December 1857 fully illustrate the
matter.  have not yet received the returns for January and February,
           I
but feel assured that they will exhibit corresponding results.

   The December of last year, which was much warmer than the
Decembers of the two preceding years, appears thus to comply with
such conditions       as to temperature      as would     lead to the conclusion
that a greater extension of the Gulf-stream              had existed about ‘the
end of 185 7, than towards the close of 1856 or 1855.
                          Iaothermals of the British Ialea*.
    It will be interesting to compare the mean temperature of a southern
inland station, where the observations may be depended upon as being
of the best class.        The    mean    temperature     of Oxford      during   the
December of 1857 was 45°'0          ; in December 1856, 40°'5        ; in December
   * The <U+FB01>gures    denote   the mean annual temperature,     in degrees Fahr., corre
sponding   to each isothermal line.

                                          328
  1855, 37°'2.      All the stations on the     west coast are situated  in higher
 latitudes, yet their mean temperature was in excess           of that of Oxford
 in December       1857 by    2°'l  ;  in the colder Decembers of       1856    and
  1855, by 0°'5 and l°'4 respectively.          During the warmest month, the
 mean    of all the  coast  stations exceeded the temperature of Oxford by
 2°'();    and during      the   other    two   Decembers    by   l°'3  and    l°'6
  respectively.
     I propose to make more complete calculations, which will embrace
  the other months belonging to the winter; and by comparing                    the
 results during different years, it is probable that corresponding infer
 ences   will be suggested    regarding the variations of mean temperature
 which are incapable of explanation by changes of solar radiation alone.
     I was induced to select       December at <U+FB01>rst, because       the amount of
 sunshine received in our hemisphere being least during that month,
 it  was natural     to expect that the comparative effects of the other
 thermal in<U+FB02>uences would be most distinctly manifested.
     Having    been for some time occupied in studying           the distribution
 of heat over islands,     I have     been led to the general proposition,    that
 the isothermals may be represented by curves having some relation
 to the coast-line, and that the positions of the centres of these curves
 depend    upon the relation between solar in<U+FB02>uence and oceanic tempe
rature.      At  seasons when the latter becomes important, compared to
 the former, the isothermals tend to assume re-entrant shapes similar
to the mean annual isothermals            of Ireland.    When the isothermals
of   a mild   winter mouth, like December of 1857, shall be laid down,
I   anticipate that they will distinctly         exhibit the increased thermal
in<U+FB02>uence of the ocean by presenting such an appearance.

XVII. “On         the In<U+FB02>uence of Temperature on the Refraction of

    Those who have occupied themselves with the determination                   of
refractive indices, must have noticed that changes of temperature

                                                        329
influence the amount             of refraction; yet                         few      of the observations on
record have affixed to them the temperature at which they were
made, and few, if any, numerical researches have been published on
the subject. To determine, if possible, the amount and character of
this effect of heat      was the object                    of the present inquiry.
  The instrument employed was that described by the Rev. Baden
Powell in the British Association Report for 1839, and was kindly
lent by him for the purpose. The substances more or less fully
examined, were bisulphide of carbon, water, ether, methylic, vinic,
amylic, and caprylic alcohols, the two principal constituents of
creasote—hydrate          of phenyle and hydrate of cresyle, phosphorus,                                                          oil
cassia, and camphor dissolved                         in   alcohol.
   Of the tabulated results the following two will suffice                                                       to     illustrate

     The following         are the conclusions arrived at               :—
     1.    In    every substance     the refractive index diminishes as the tem
perature increases.              This is     seen in the <U+FB01>rst four columns                   of the
tabulated results, which represent the refractive indices of the <U+FB01>xed
lines of the spectrum A, D, and                    H    respectively at the temperatures
indicated, while the succeeding column shows the amount of differ
ence for each            <U+FB01>ve   degrees      Centigrade.          This   change      of refractive
index by heat, for which                 the term sensitiveness            is proposed, varies
greatly in amount in different substances,                          melted phosphorus             and
bisulphide of carbon being the most, and water the least sensitive                                 of
the liquids examined.
     2.    The length of the spectrum              varies as the temperature increases.
The difference           between    the refractive indices of the lines               A    and    H,
or ya —,u‘, is taken as the measurable length of the spectrum, and is
given in the sixth column.    In the case of highly dispersive sub
stances, as bisulphide          of carbon and hydrate of phenyle, it decreases
considerably;           in the case of less dispersive bodies, as the alcohols, it
decreases         to a less extent;          while      with water the change is not
appreciable.
     3.    In    some    substances the           dispersive power is diminished,                  in
others it is augmented by a rise of temperature;                             that    is,   in such
substances as bisulphide of carbon,                  it   is   the numerator of the fraction
"u_'I‘A that decreases fastest, while in such substances                         as water     it   is
Mn   ‘"1
the denominator.               The result of this         is   shown in the last column.
     4. The sensitiveness          of   a   substance      is    independent of its speci<U+FB01>c
refractive or           dispersive power.          Thus water and ether                are    very
similar         as to the actual        amount       of the refraction and dispersion
exhibited by them, but ether                 is   many times more sensitive to heat
than water is.
     5. The amount of sensitiveness                is   not directly proportional           to the
change of density produced by alterations of temperature;                              yet there
is   some       relationship     between     the two phenomena.               Thus in water
the index of refraction             and the density both change much more
rapidly at high than at low temperatures; again, the remarkable
reversion of the increase of density that takes place at 4° C.   not                         is
without its indication in the amount of sensitiveness  and the large         ;
decrease  of density at the freezing of water                         is   accompanied by          a
similar decrease
                 of refraction.

XVIII. “On                  the Adaptation             of the Human Eye to varying
          Distances.”              By CHARLEs ARCHER, Esq., Surgeon, Bengal
          Army.             Communicated                by       Prof.       STokEs,         Sec.        R.S.
          Received         June       17, 1858.                                              s'
                                               (Abstract.)
  The following is a summary of the author's views on the question:—
  1. The eye is adapted to varying distances principally by an alter
ation in the fibrous arrangement                      of the lens itself.            Moreover, that
when the lens is removed after an operation for cataract, the power
of adaptation is nearly lost, and can only be exerted within very
confined distances.
    2. That the purpose of focalizing light at short distances is doubt
less assisted, as suggested by Bowman, by the contractions of the
ciliary muscle, in              its
                      antero-posterior direction, bringing forward the
ciliary processes.
     3.   That       as   the posterior hemisphere               of   the capsule    is     firmly united
to   the hyaloid membrane, this portion must always remain quiescent,
and therefore the antero-posterior contractions                               of   the ciliary muscle
must       be   very limited          as   regards the lens.
                                                                                                            of its
     4.   That the ciliary muscle, being placed around the                                   eye, and
fibres being          of   a   somewhat plexiform                character, the contractions
the muscle will relax those yielding portions                            of   the eye placed within
                                                                                    -
its circumference.                                                                                         .    *
     5.   That the relaxations                of   the ciliary processes will deprive the
capsule         of   its   firm support.         It   will   be   pressed forward             by      the lens,

                                          332
  which will meet with         no further   resistance   to the expansion of its
  short axis.
     6.   That the lens itself,     as microscopically    described by Bowman
 and     Kiilliker, is admirably      adapted to the varying        changes which
 take place in the capsule.
     7.   That    the posterior    capsule being <U+FB01>rmly united to the hyaloid
 membrane, the alteration in the diameters of the cavity of the cap
 sule must take place from the periphery              of the lens to its centre,
 and from behind forwards, but not from before backwards, on account
 of the     close union   of the posterior capsule    to the hyaloid membrane.
    8.    That   to allow such alteration to take place without           endanger
 ing the achromatism of the lens,          the alterations in the plane of its
 long diameter must be synchronous with the alterations in the plane
 of its short diameter.        To allow of this, the margin of the lens is free
 in the canal        of Petit; were it not the case, chromatic aberration
 would result.
    9.    That the elasticity of the capsule of the          lens  and   the ciliary
 muscle are antagonistic       ; that on the ciliary muscle becoming relaxed,
 the capsule of the lens is free to exert that elasticity.
    10.     That, by the pressure exerted by the anterior hemisphere of
 the capsule by means of the polygonal cells of Virchow on the ante
 rior   face   of the lens, the organ is able to ful<U+FB01>l all the requirements
for adapting it to receive focalized light from long distances.
    11. That the polygonal cells of Virchow are placed on the pos
terior surface of the anterior          hemisphere of the capsule with the
view before mentioned, and that they are arranged with their long
diameters in an antero-posterior direction, that pressure may not
injure their transparency, which would be the case             if placed  laterally.
    12.    That    these cells are not found in other parts       of the capsule.
    13.    That the <U+FB01>bres of the lens         are  serrated for the purpose of
uniting either to other,          so  as to allow    them greater freedom of
motion without altering their ultimate relations to each other.
    14.    That the ciliary muscle is very highly        endowed     with nervous
matter to supply all these varying requirements.
    15.    By the     above  postulates, all the modern discoveries in the
microscopical        anatomy of the eye receive        a  distinct   expression   of
their individual        functions,   and, by so doing, adapt the organ of
vision to the acknowledged laws of light.

of    cubics, viz. the determination                             of    the points         of    a    cubic, through
which      it   is   possible        to   draw        an   infinity         of   cubics having             a   nine-point

  contact, or complete osculation, with the given cubic.           It is shown
 that the points in question are those which are their own third
 tangentials, and this suggests the consideration of the new canonical
 form, av’;/+y’z+z’x+2mxyz=0,            of the equation of the cubic; this
 inquiry, however,    is  not pursued in the paper.

    Genera     Peneroplis, Operculina,       and Amphistegina.          By W.
    B. CARPENTER,         M.D., F.R.S. &c.        Received    June 17, 1858.
                                  (Abstract.)
    In his preceding memoirs, the author has shown that two very
 dissimilar types of structure present themselves among Foraminifera,
 one characterized by its simplicity,      the other by its complexity.       In
 the former, of which Orbitolites,      Orbiculina, and Alveolina     are  typi
 cal examples, the calcareous skeleton does not present any de<U+FB01>nite
 indications of organization,     but seems to have been formed by the
 simple calci<U+FB01>cation      of a portion  of the homogeneous sarcode-body
 of the animal; that sarcode-body is but very imperfectly divided
 into segments, the communications between the cavities occupied
 by these segments       being very free and irregular; the form of the
 segments themselves, and the mode          of their connexion,   are alike  in
constant;     and even the plan of growth, on which the character             of
the organism as a whole depends, though             preserving a general uni
formity,   is by no means invariably maintained.            In the latter, to
which Cycloclypeua and Heterostegina            belong, the calcareous skele
ton is found to present a very de<U+FB01>nite and elaborate organization.
The   several   segments    of the body   are so completely separated     from
each other,    that they remain connected only by delicate threads            of
sarcode.     Each segment thus isolated       has its own proper calcareous
envelope,   which seems to be moulded (as it were) upon it; and this
envelope or shell is perforated with minute parallel tubuli closely
resembling those of dentine, except in the absence of bifurcation;               _
the   partition-walls     between   adjacent    segments    are  consequently
double, and are strengthened by an intermediate calcareous deposit,
which is traversed by a system of inosculating passages that seems
properly to belong to it.       The form of the      segments,  their mode of

                                        335
 communication,       and consequently the general plan of growth, have
 a very    considerable degree      of constancy;    and altogether     the ten
 dency is strongly manifested in this type to the greater individuali
 zation of the parts of the composite body, which in the preceding
 must be looked upon rather as constituting          one aggregate whole.
    In the present memoir this contrast is fully carried out by            a de
tailed comparison of two characteristic         examples from these        types
respectively,     each  of them having its own features of peculiar in
                                          I
 terest.
    In Peneroplis     we <U+FB01>nd,   both as to the simplicity of the structure
 of the shell, and the general disposition of the segments of the
 animal, a close resemblance to the spiral forms of Orbiculina; the
only    difference being the absence        of the transverse or secondary
 divisions   of the chambers.       In  what is considered its typical form,
the shell is a <U+FB02>attened spire, opening but widely in its last whorl;
and the chambers communicate with each other (as does the last
chamber with the exterior) by single rows of isolated pores disposed
at regular     intervals along the septa.      But the spire    is occasionally
found    to   be   more turgid,    and the rows of apertures to become
doubled; and instead of opening out in the last whorl, it is fre
quently prolonged in a rectilineal direction.          In tropical seas there
are   found    minute    shells  resembling those of Peneroplis in their
very characteristic       external   markings,   but   having  a very     turgid
spire, and having the row of pores in each             septum replaced by a
single large ori<U+FB01>ce with irregularly radiating          prolongations.      This
type of structure       has   been   characterized   by  M. d’Orbigny       as a
separate    genus, under the name of Demlritina;          and when its spire,
as   in many forms of Peneroplis, is continued rectilineally, it has
been distinguished as a third genus under the name Spirolina. The
author shows, by an extensive comparison of individuals,               that the
single dendritic ori<U+FB01>ce is to be regarded as formed by the coalescence
of   separate    pores;   and that    the extension of these     into  a single
line, or their aggregation into a cluster,        is related to the form of
the septal plane, as determined          by the degree    of <U+FB02>attening or of
turgescence of the spire.        Consequently in his view Dendritina and
Spirolina    are but varieties   of Peneroplis; the former, which are by
far the largest and the most highly developed, being of tropical
growth, whilst the most <U+FB02>attened forms of the latter are the com
   vor.. rx.                                                       2 A

paratively stunted inhabitants of the Mediterranean               and other seas
of  less elevated temperature.
    In Operculina,     on the other hand, we <U+FB01>nd the shell presenting
the minutely tubular structure which was <U+FB01>rst shown by the author
to exist in Nummulites; to which             genus    Operculina     is so closely
allied in structure,     that the only positive difference between            them
seems to lie    in the tendency of Operculina to open out widely in the
last whorl, whilst Nummulites (according to MM. d’Archiac and
Haime) tends to close in. The author minutely describes the struc
ture of Operculina,     which    presents a very remarkable development
of the canaliferous system; he          also   enters into a detailed inquiry
into the relation of the numerous strongly-marked               varieties of form
which it presents,—-a question of much importance in regard to the
value of the characters of the reputed species             among Nummulites;
and shows that the range of individual variation in form and surface
markings      is so wide     as is proved      by the gradational       transitions
which present themselves         between    what at <U+FB01>rst sight appear to be
widely-separated types), that only where some very decided and con
stant di<U+FB01>erence of internal conformation presents itself, will it be safe
to assume    a  speci<U+FB01>c diversity.   In   one case, in which he had thought
that    a  certain series    of specimens      was    su<U+FB01>icicntly    distinguished
by its peculiar physiognomy from the rest, residual forms presented
themselves which could not be with certainty assigned to either
type, so completely do they link together the two by the softening
down of the peculiarities of each.          And a yet more remarkable link
of connexion is established by examples collected                on   the coast   of
Japan by the American          expedition     to that country,      in which the
most distinctive characters of each type are curiously combined.
    Closely related to Operculina is another genus, Amplzistegina,
which bears an equally near resemblance to Nummulites, though it
has been      completely separated      from both in the classi<U+FB01>cation            of
M. d’Orbigny, who         has placed  it in  a  distinct order, Entomostégues,
on account of the unsymmetrical form of its shell and the alternating
disposition of its chambers.         But the author has found, from an
extensive comparison of individuals,         that this want of symmetry is so
little constant,    as to be altogether valueless in a systematic point           of
view, many specimens          being perfectly      symmetrical,     whilst   others
 are very far from      being so, and every         gradation    presenting itself

                                       337
  between these     two extremes.       The most common among existing
 species is the Amphistegina        gibbosa, which is very extensively dif
 fused through      the tropical   ocean,   and which,    though generally of
 small size, acquires in the Philippine region dimensions nearly equal
 to those of the fossil Amphistegina        of the Vienna and other tertiary
 deposits.     But Mr. Cuming’s Philippine collection contains another
 and far larger species,    which     is distinguished  by the extraordinary
 thinning-out of the last whorl;          and  it is remarkable that in this
 species  the canal-system is highly developed, although            completely
 absent in  A. gibbosa,—a     difference of structure, which,     going along
 with very   close resemblance    in external aspect and general confor
 mation, seems only to be accounted for on the supposition             that the
 difference in size requires a difference in the arrangement of the
 nutrient apparatus.

        Spinal    Cord.”    By   J.   Locxnanr CLARKE,           Esq.,  F.R.S.
        Received June 17, 1858.
                                  ( Abstract.)
    In this communication it is proposed, for            reasons  assigned, to
divide each lateral half of the posterior           grey substance into two
portions   :-1.    The caput cormlc posterioris;       2,  the cervix    cm-mic
posterioris.     The caput consists of the broad or expanded extremity
of the coma, and is separated from the cervix by an imaginary line
drawn across from the opposite anterior extremities of the gelatinous
substance;    the cervix comprises the remaining anterior          portion   of
the cornu.
    The caput    cormia consists  of two different portions :—1. an outer
and comparatively      transparent     portion,   the gelatinous   substance;
2. an inner and more opaque portion, or base.
    1.  The outer portion or gelatinous substance consists of,—
       A. Nerve-<U+FB01>bres, transverse, longitudinal, and oblique.
       B. Nerve-cells, large, small, and intermediate.
       C. Blood-vessels, and connective tissue, with numerous nuclei.
   2. The inner or more opaque portion of the caput cormis is con
tinuous   with the grey substance of the cervix, and surrounded

                                          338
behind and on each side by the gelatinous substance, with                   which   it
varies in shape       at different regions of the cord.             In addition to
blood-vessels and connective tissue, it consists of,—
       A. Nerve-<U+FB01>bres, transverse, longitudinal, and oblique.
       B. Nerve-cells, both large and small.
    A. The longitudinal <U+FB01>bres form bundles of various                 sizes, and are
broader and coarser than those of the gelatinous                 substance, which,
however, they immediately adjoin.
    The transverse and oblique <U+FB01>bres are continuous with the posterior
roots of the nerves, and partly with the longitudinal <U+FB01>bres, which
                                                          '
they also cross in a great variety of ways.
    About the middle of the dorsal region, in the spinal cord of the
higher vertebrata, the posterior cornua are united in a single mass.
The inner or median half of            each   cervix corn<U+FB02>s is occupied by a
remarkable longitudinal         column, which is cylindrical         or   oval,-the
posterior vesicular column. This consists of a cylinder of <U+FB01>bres inter
spersed with and surrounded by cells and thin processes.                  The <U+FB01>bres
are derived from the posterior roots of         the nerves,     and  interlace  with
each other in an intricate manner.           The cells    are oval, fusiform, and
variously     stellate, and differ    considerably     in   size,  but the largest
are equal to those      of the anterior cornu.       They       are elongated   with
thin   processes    transversely,   longitudinally,     and obliquely,       and are
continuous with <U+FB01>bres in the same direction, including the posterior
roots.                                               _
    At  the lateral border of the grey substance, between the anterior
and posterior cornua, is      a  small and somewhat triangular tract, which
is more transparent than the rest, and projects more or less into the
lateral column.        This tract, which     was pointed out by the author
in   1851, and is named the tractus          intermedio-laleralis,       consists of
oval, fusiform, and triangular        cells, which are smaller and of more
uniform     size than those      of the surrounding         substance.      Some   of
them     are   elongated transversely and longitudinally,—transversely
both in a lateral and antero-posterior direction,--and send their pro
cesses on the one hand to the transverse commissure, and on the
other to the anterior and posterior cornua.
    In receding from the dorsal           to the cervical region, the central
portion or cylinder      of  each posterior vesicular column is reduced            in
 size and less completely circumscribed.          In the middle of the cervical

                                          -339
  enlargement       it entirely disappears, but the whole inner half of the
  cervix cormis is still interspersed with            numerous   cells of various
  shapes, and traversed by the posterior roots and the <U+FB01>bres          of the trans
  verse commissure.          At the origin of the third pair of cervical    nerves,
  a darker mass        reappears in the same situation, but gradually         dimi
  nishes as    it  ascends to the medulla oblongata.
      The tractus intermedio-lateralia        is larger in the upper part than
  in the middle of the dorsal region, and projects further into the
  lateral column.         As it ascends, however, through the cervical en
  largement,      it gradually diminishes, and at length disappears;            but
  the lateral portion of the grey substance contains numerous branched
  and elongated cells, amongst which are a few that resemble those                of
  the tractus intermedio-lateralis; it is traversed by the anterior and
  posterior roots, and by the lowest roots of the spinal-accessory nerve
  on   their way to the anterior cornu.           In the region of the <U+FB01>rst pair
 of cervical      nerves,  a distinct  vesicular tract reappears at the lateral
 part   of the grey substance. It is traversed by the roots of the spinal
 accessory nerves, and partly by those of the spinal nerves.              Its cells
 are     elongated      transversely  and    longitudinally.     Ascending      the
 medulla oblongata, this vesicular tract makes its way inwards to the
 space    behind      the central   canal, where    it forms the nucleus of the
 upper roots of the spinal-accessory nerve.
     In descending the cord from the dorsal region, the grey substance
 undergoes a series         of changes nearly similar       to those which      are
 observed in ascending to the cervical enlargement.                   But in the
 upper part of the lumbar enlargement, the posterior vesicular columns
 are much larger than in any other region of the cord, and contain
 more large cells.         Through the rest of the lumbar enlargement the
 number of large cells diminishes; but they are still traversed and
 surrounded by the posterior roots of the nerves, and by the transverse
 commissure.
    In the spinal cord of Man, the form of the grey substance differs
in some respects from that in Mammalia.                Throughout the whole of
the dorsal region the posterior cornua stand completely apart.                The
posterior vesicular columns are oval, but in structure resemble those
in the Ox.         In the middle of the cervical and lumbar enlargements,

   The tractue intermedio-later-alie in Man presents nearly the same
appearance as in Mammalia, and contains the same kind of cells. In
the lumbar       region it is still prominent at the side of the grey sub
stance,    but its cells are less numerous than in the dorsal region.         In
the upper part of the cervical region a similar tract reappears, which
is traversed by the roots of the spinal accessory,          and those of the
spinal nerves.
    In Birds,     as  in Mammalia, the posterior cornua        are united in a
single mass, both in the dorsal region and lower part of the conue me
dullaris; and the gelatinous substance extends uninterruptedly            across
from side to side.        There are no dark masses corresponding to those
of the posterior vesicular columns of mammalia, although numerous
cells are scattered through the same space.           There are no traces      of
any distinct tractus intermedio-lateralia.        In Reptiles it  is only in the
conus medullaris        that the posterior cornua form     a single mass.      A
distinct stratum of small fusiform cells, in connexion with the <U+FB01>bres
of the posterior roots, extends diagonally          from the point of each
cornu to the transverse commissure.
    In the Ox and Sheep the epithelium of the           canal   consists, not of
cylindrical,    but of fusiform cells arranged in close apposition.         The
 <U+FB01>bres proceeding from them are precisely similar in appearance to
 those of the connective tissue which surrounds the cord, and, like
those <U+FB01>bres, they are in connexion at intervals with minute nuclei              ;
in    the <U+FB01>lum terminale the author has satisfactorily             traced them
 through the grey substance to the surface of the cord.             In the <U+FB01>lum
terminale, where the nerve-cells and nerve-roots entirely disappear,
the canal, and consequently the number of epithelium-cells, are much
greater than in the cervical or lumbar enlargement, where the nerve
 cells and nerve-roots are abundant.          These facts are opposed to the
 statements     of  those observers who profess to have traced their con
nexion with nerve-cells and nerve-<U+FB01>bres.
    The white columns of the cord            are traversed by a network of
connective tissue, which abounds with nuclei and small cells pre
cisely similar to those found in the grey substance.
    In   the  conus medullaris,     the author has   distinctly seen some of
 the anterior roots of the nerves         form loops around the group of
 stellate  cells, instead   of terminating in them.

 XXII. “On       some new Ethyl-compounds                 containing the Alkali
       metals.”       By   J.  A. WANKLYN, Esq. Communicated by
       Enwaan FRANKLAND, Ph.D. Received June 10, 1858.
                                      (Abstract.)
    The very remarkable composition and properties of that                   class of
 substances comprehending            kakodyl and zinc-ethyl, have justly at
 tached no ordinary degree         of interest to the so-called organo-metallic
 compounds.
    In<U+FB02>uenced by that interest,         I was led to inquire whether the series
 might not include members into whose composition the alkali-metals
 entered.    It was a question whether combination               between so power
 fully electro-positive     a body     as potassium      or    sodium on the one
 hand, and a hydrocarbon             radical   on the      other, did not involve
impossible    conditions.       It   seemed    that   the answer to this query
would not be valueless        as a  contribution    to the store     of facts out of
which    we may hope some           day to evoke the conditions of chemical
combination.
    My  researches    in this direction have already enabled me to pro
duce combinations of ethyl with potassium and sodium; and I have
little doubt that     I  shall be able to produce similar compounds con
taining lithium, barium, strontium, calcium, and magnesium.                    Com
binations   containing     methyl in place of ethyl will also be sought.
The present paper will        be devoted chie<U+FB02>y to the ethyl-compound              of
sodium.
                                    Sodium-ethyl.
    Experiments    made with a view to the formation               of this body by
reactions similar to that by which zinc-ethyl                is produced,    yielded
negative results   ;  but some months ago           I  made the observation that
potassium and sodium decomposed zinc-ethyl, and                  I found  the action
to consist  in the replacement of         a portion     of the zinc by the metal
employed.
    Sodium-ethyl     was prepared as follows        :-A tube of      soft glass was
closed at one end and <U+FB01>lled with coal-gas.                In it  was then placed a
single clean piece      of sodium; its open extremity was then closed
with the <U+FB01>nger, and whilst still <U+FB01>lled with coal-gas, the tube was
contracted about the middle,            drawn out and bent twice at right
angles;   pure   zinc-ethyl,      in quantity     about ten times the weight

                                                       342
of the sodium,         was next introduced, and the tube hermetically sealed.
So prepared, the apparatus was afterwards placed in cold water, and
left therein for several days, being cautiously shaken up at intervals.
  During this time the following changes were noted in the contents
of the tube. The sodium became coated with zinc, and gradually
disappeared, whilst the total volume of the solid and liquid contents
diminished considerably.                    The liquid              became also viscid, and some
times separated into two portions non-miscible                                  with each other, be
coming, however, homogeneous as the operation advanced.                                          There
was no evolution             of   gas.
   After the         lapse   of    some days the apparatus was found to contain
metallic zinc and            a   clear colourless liquid.                   The former      was weighed
and found to correspond to the sodium dissolved, one equivalent                                      of
zinc being precipitated for each equivalent of sodium dissolved.
  The clear liquid was made the subject of special examination. It
consisted of zinc-ethyl holding in solution a crystalline compound
containing sodium, zinc, and ethyl.                            It was     in<U+FB02>ammable to the last de
gree, burning explosively, on exposure to the air, with a yellow <U+FB02>ame,
and leaving      a    very alkaline residue.                    Owing to its extreme tendency
to become oxidized, its manipulation                            presented great di<U+FB01>iculties.         It
was   requisite to decant                it into bulbs <U+FB01>lled with dry hydrogen or
coal-gas   ;   and since heat produced partial decomposition, the bulbs
had to be double, so that                   the        heated        bulb might        not receive the
liquid.
  The clear liquid deposited large quantities of beautiful crystals
when cooled to zero; and when gently warmed in a stream of dry
hydrogen gas, so long as zinc-ethyl came off it yielded also a mass
of crystals.          Some crystals were prepared in the latter manner;                            they
fused at about 27°               C., but    once fused they remained <U+FB02>uid at several
degrees        below     that      point.          Numerous               analytical    determinations
prove that these crystals contain two equivalents of zinc for every
equivalent of sodium, and that their formula is

   Many attempts were made to obtain sodium-ethyl                                  free from zinc
ethyl, but without success.
     By distillation it was found to                       be     equally impossible        either to
distil   o<U+FB01>'                  from the crystals, or to distil off all                              so as

to leave pure               51:1        behind.        When the crystals        are       moderately
                        4     5    }
heated in a bulb,            a     singular phenomenon occurs.               Gas    is   evolved, and
there remains behind metallic sodium, also metallic zinc, but no car
bonaceous residue.                     This reduction of          a   sodium-compound        by heat
alone    is    an anomaly in chemistry.
     When the crystals are heated in the water-bath with potassium,
a   sudden evolution of gas occurs, and there results metallic zinc, with
a   liquid alloy of potassium and sodium—a result likewise peculiar.
     When the crystals are heated in the water-bath with excess of
sodium, evolution of gas likewise takes place.
     From      these    experiments             it   would seem that the conjoined zinc
ethyl    is    necessary to the existence of sodium-ethyl; or more pre
cisely, that some adjunct of                    a    less positive nature than sodium-ethyl
is   requisite to make the existence of the latter possible.

With water there,is given pure hydride of ethyl, and hydrated oxides
of zinc and sodium.                     The reaction takes place with great evolution
of heat.
     With carbonic acid there                   is   given propionate of soda, which unites
with zinc-ethyl forming double compound, decomposed on the ad
                                         a
dition of water. To the account of this reaction, published else
where,   I      have to add that             it        of ethyl
                                                  takes place without        evolution
or any other gas—a result which further con<U+FB01>rms the formula of
sodium-ethyl adopted in this paper.
     With carbonic oxide there                    is   also   a   reaction, which   is   in course of
examination.
     Cyanogen gas             is   instantly absorbed, with the formation of                a      brown
solution.
     With ether there                   seems     to be no reaction.         For the       rest,    with
oxygen, iodine, &c.,               I     should        predict     reactions quite analogous to
those of zinc-ethyl, but have not specially examined the point.

     Zinc-ethyl and potassium react still more readily than the former
 body and sodium.        So far as at present ascertained, the cases greatly
 resemble one another.        Just as with sodium,       I obtain  crystals readily
 soluble    in zinc-ethyl,     which   contain    in this     case abundance     of
 potassium.
     Seeing that the kind of reaction brought              under notice in this
 paper is apparently unique, it is necessary to offer a few observations
 upon it.

     The reaction here formulated may be regarded as an electrolytic
 decomp0sition——as an ordinary case of precipitation of one metal by
 a more electro-positive       metal.    Here ethyl is the electro-negative,
 and zinc the electro-positive member: sodium is more electro-posi
 tive than zinc, and accordingly sodium displaces zinc.
     Following out the hyp0thesis—-where the organo-metallic body
 contains   a  metal less electro-positive than the hydrocarbon            radical,
 I  should expect that the hydrocarbon radical would be eliminated
 by the action of sodium. Kakodyl, for instance, should give methyl
 and arsenide of sodium.

 out the space lying between         the electro-positive     sodium and the
 electro-negative ethyl.
  XXIII.     “Note     on Sodium-ethyl       and    Potassium-ethyl.”          By
        EDWARD      FRANKLAND,       Ph.D., F.R.S.         Received   June 17,
        1858.
     The recent interesting discovery of sodium-ethyl           and potassium
 ethyl by Mr. Wanklyn, led me to investigate the cause of the non
 formation of these bodies by reactions analogous to those success
  fully used for the production   of zinc-ethyl and similar organo-metallic
 compounds.       In my earlier experiments upon the isolation of the
 organic radicals,    I studied the action of potassium and sodium upon
 iodide of ethyl, and found that the latter compound was readily de
  composed by either of the metals at a temperature of from 100° to
  130° C. The separated ethyl was, however, transformed almost com
  pletely into hydride     of ethyl and ole<U+FB01>ant     gas,   whilst not a trace    of
  potassium-ethyl    or sodium-ethyl     was produced.       Mr. Wanklyn has

                                           346
  since repeated      this experiment with the addition of ether, and has
  obtained the same result as regards the non-formation                  of  an organo
  metallic compound.
      The temperature        at which   sodium decomposes          iodide of ethyl is
  much lower than that at which             sodium-ethyl       is broken      up, conse
  quently no explanation of the phenomenon can be obtained from
  this source.       In his observations on the formation of ethyl*, Brodie
‘mentions that iodide of ethyl is decomposed             at 170° C. by zinc-ethyl;
  and it therefore occurred to me that sodium-ethyl, owing to its more
  powerful a<U+FB02>inities, might effect the decomposition of iodide of ethyl
  at a lower temperature than that at which iodide                of ethyl is decom
  posed by sodium; in which case the production of sodium-ethyl, by
  the action of sodium upon iodide of ethyl, would be an impossibility.
  Experiment       completely con<U+FB01>rmed this anticipation.               A   quantity   of
  a strong solution      of sodium-ethyl in zinc-ethyl        was thrown up into a
  dry receiver <U+FB01>lled with mercury, and an equal volume of pure iodide
  of ethyl added      to it.    Immediately on the mixture of the two liquids,
  a lively effervescence       set in, a considerable quantity        of gas collected
 in the    receiver,   and   a white deposit of iodide of sodium rendered the
 liquid thick     and turbid.       The reaction   was complete in two or three
 minutes without         the application    of heat.      An analysis of the gas,
 previously freed from the vapours of iodide of ethyl and zinc-ethyl,
 showed it to consist of equal volumes of hydride of ethyl and ole<U+FB01>ant
 gas, mixed only with a mere trace         of ethyl.    This reaction       may there
 fore be thus expressed         :—
              0, H,Na-1-C, H, I=NaI+C‘                     +o,H,.
     It is therefore evident that sodium-ethyl, and the remark no doubt
applies also to potassium-ethyl,          could not be obtained by the action
of sodium upon iodide of ethyl,             even   if the decomposition of the
latter could be effected at ordinary temperatures, since each particle
of the organo-metallic compound being in contact with iodide of ethyl
at the moment of its formation, would be instantly decomposed in
the manner just described.            That ole<U+FB01>ant     gas and hydride         of ethyl,
with    mere traces only       of ethyl, constitute the gaseous product of the
decomposition of iodide of ethyl by sodium, is strong evidence that
this formation and immediate decomposition of sodium-ethyl actually

                                         347
takes place.    Sodium-ethyl thus stands in the same relation to iodide
of ethyl as hydride of zinc does to hydriodic acid; and consequently
all attempts to produce hydride of zinc by the action of the metal
upon the hydrogen        acids have failed.          These considerations, taken
in connexion with Mr. Wanklyn’s mode of forming sodium-ethyl and
potassium-ethyl, afford a clue to the nature of the reactions by which
we shall probably eventually succeed               in forming the hydrogen com
pounds of the highly positive metals.    Although the hydrogen com
pounds of arsenic, antimony, phosphorus, and tellurium are by no
means exact analogues of zinc-ethyl, it would nevertheless be interest
ing to ascertain the action of sodium upon              these bodies,      with   a view
to the formation of hydride of sodium.
  The nature of the      gas evolved     by the action of sodium-ethyl upon
iodide of ethyl, has some        interest in connexion with the formation of
ethyl by the action of zinc upon iodide of ethyl.                 Brodie expressed,
in the memoir above alluded to, an ingenious and highly probable
hypothesis, that the true source of the ethyl is the decomposition of
its iodide by zinc-ethyl, thus         :—
                 o,H,                                  c H       ;
                         z..+c,1=1,1=z.1I+C:H:}
and that the secondary products of the reaction (ole<U+FB01>ant gas and by
dride of ethyl) which always accompany the ethyl, result from the
primary action of zinc upon iodide of ethyl, thus :—
               2(o, H, 1)+2z..=o,
                                              H,+C-1%} +2ZnI.
The composition of the           gases produced      in the above reaction of        so
dium-ethyl upon iodide of ethyl seems, however, to indicate that the
reverse of this hypothesis is true, and that the source of the ethyl is
to be found in the primary action of zinc upon iodide of ethyl,-—

XXIV. “Experimental Inquiry              into the Composition of some
        of the Animals        fed  and slaughtered     as   Human Food.”
        By J. B. Lawns, Esq., F.R.S., F.C.S., and J. H. GILBERT,
        Ph.D., F.C.S. Received June 17, 1858.
                                   (Abstract.)
    After alluding to the importance of the chemical statistics of
nutrition in relation to physiology, dietetics and rural economy, and
explaining that the branch of the subject comprehended in the pre
sent paper is that of Animal Composition, the authors proceed in
the <U+FB01>rst place to state the general nature of their investigations, and
the manner in which they were conducted.
    To ascertain the quantitative relations, and the tendency of         deve
lopment, of the different parts of the system,           the weights of the
entire bodies, and of the several      internal organs, also of some other
separated parts, were determined in several hundred animals—oxen,
sheep and pigs.
    To determine the ultimate composition, and in a sense the proxi
mate composition also, of oxen, sheep and pigs, and to obtain the
results in‘ such manner that they might serve to estimate             the pro
bable composition        of the Increase whilst fattening,      was  a  labour
obviously too great to be undertaken with a large number of ani
 mals.      Those selected were—a fat calf, a half-fat ox, a moderately
 fat ox, a fat lamb, a store or lean sheep,      a  half-fat old sheep, a fat
 sheep, a very fat sheep, a store pig, and a fat     pig.
     It  is to the methods and the results of the analysis of these ten
 animals, to the information acquired as to the quantitative relation of
 the organs or parts in the different descriptions of animal, and their
 relative development during the fattening process,         and to the appli
 cation of the data thus provided, that the authors chie<U+FB02>y con<U+FB01>ne
 themselves in the present paper.
     The    analyses   of the ten animals   were planned     to determine the
 actual and per-centage amounts—of water, of mineral                matter,  of
 total nitrogenous compounds, of fat, and of total dry substance—in
 the entire bodies, and in certain individual        and classi<U+FB01>ed parts of
  the animals.       The water and mineral matter    were   for the most part
  determined in each      internal organ, or other separated part.      But, to

                                                              349
confine the labour within reasonable limits, and to facilitate as far as
possible  the perception of the practical and economic application                                                          of
the results, the other constituents enumerated are given                                                   in
     1st. The collective “carcass” parts; that                                         is,     the frame with               its
covering         of
             flesh and fat, which comprise the most important                                                             por
tions sold as human food.
     2nd. The collective                   “    offal” parts; including the whole                                    of   the
internal organs, the head, the feet, and,                                         in   the case            of    oxen and
sheep, the pelt and hair                        or   wool.
     3rd. The entire animal (fasted live-weight).
     Referring first     the composition
                                   to         the “collective carcass        of
parts,”       it   appeared, comparing one animal with another, that there
isa    general disposition                   to
                                             a       rise      or   fall   in   the per-centage              of    mineral
matter, with the rise                      or   fall     in    that    of    the nitrogenous compounds.
In    fact,      all   the results tended                      to   show     a    prominent               connexion        be
tween the amount                of   the mineral matters and that                                 of   the nitrogenous
constituents            of   the body.
  Comparing the relative proportions                                       of   fat    and nitrogenous com
pounds    the respective “carcasses,”
               in                                                            it   appeared that,                  in    every
instance excepting that                         of   the calf, there was considerably more                                  of
dry fat than            of   dry nitrogenous compounds.                                 In     the carcass           of   even
the store          or   lean sheep, there was more than                                         13     times      as   much
fat    as     nitrogenous           substance;                 in     that      of
                                                                              the store      lean pig,      or
twice       as   much.         In       the carcass              of   the half-fat ox, there was one
fourth more fat than nitrogenous matter; and                                                   in   that    of    the   half
fat sheep, more than twice                           as   much.
     Of   the fatter animals,                     the carcass              of    the fat             ox   contained        2:
times,        that     of    the fat            sheep      4        times, and that                  of    the very fat
sheep,      6    times        as   much fat               as   nitrogenous substance.                            Lastly,    in
the carcass            of    the moderately fat pig, there was nearly                                       5     times        as
                                   it as
much fatty matter                       nitrogenous compounds.
     From these facts                      may       be   concluded, that                                       of
                                                                                       be in
                                                                                               carcasses           oxen     in
reputed          good condition,                 there will seldom                             less than twice                 as
much, and frequently nearly                          3   times       as   much dry          fat   as   dry nitrogenous
substance.             It    may           be   presumed, that                  in    the carcasses               of   sheep
the fat will generally amount                               to   more than             3,      and frequently             to4
(or   even more) times                  as   much         as   the nitrogenous matters; and finally,
that    in    the carcasses             of      pigs killed for fresh pork, there                           will seldom

                                           350
 be as   little  as 4, and    in those  fed for curing there   will   be more than
 4 times as much fat as nitrogenous compounds.
    The fat of the        bones constituted but a small proportion        of that of
 the entire carcasses; whilst the nitrogen            of the  bones amounted to
 a considerable proportion of the whole.
    It  appeared, that whilst the per-centage (in the carcasses) of both
 mineral and nitrogenous matters decreased as the animals matured,
 that of the fat very considerably            increased.    The    increase  in the
 per-centage of fat was much more than equivalent to the collective
 decrease     in that of the other solid matters,——that         is to say, as the
 animal matures, the per-centage in its carcass, of total dry substance
 —-and especially of fat——much increases.
    The    carcass    of the calf contained     62% per cent., that     of the lean
 sheep    57§rd per cent., that of the lean pig 55§rd, and that of the
 half-fat ox 54 per cent. of water.              In the carcass of the fat ox
 there were 45% per cent., in that of the fat lamb 48%rds per cent.,
in that of the half-fat old sheep 49-grds per cent., in that of the
fat sheep       39-f=rds   per cent., in that of the very fat sheep only 33
per cent., and in that of the moderately fattened pig only 38% per
cent. of water.          The bones of the carcasses contained a less propor
tion of water than the collective soft or edible portions.
   It   is inferred, that the average of carcasses of well-fattened oxen
will contain       50 per cent.,    or rather more,     of dry substance; that
those of properly fattened sheep will contain more still—say 55 to
60 per     cent.; those of pigs killed for fresh pork rather more than
those of sheep; whilst the sides of pigs fed and slaughtered for
curing will be drier still.         Lamb-carcasses would seem to contain          a
smaller proportion of dry substance than those of either moderately
fattened oxen,        sheep,   or pigs.    Their proportion     of   bone was also
comparatively high.            Veal appeared to be the moistest of all.        The
carcass     of the calf experimented upon, though the animal               was con
sidered to be well fattened, contained only               375} per cent. of dry
substance.        Its proportion of      bone was also higher      than in any of
the other animals.
   Next     as to the composition       of the collective qfal parts (excluding
the contents of stomachs and intestines), the results showed that
in every     case the per-centage      of nitrogenous substance        was greater,
and that of the fat very much less, than in the collective carcass parts.

                                                               35]
      In     oxen and sheep, the pelt, hair or wool, hoofs, stomachs and
intestines, taken together, contained a large proportion                                                      of the total
nitrogen of the offal parts. The portions of the nitrogenous offal
parts of these animals, generally used for food, are, the head-flesh
with tongue and brains, the heart, the liver, the pancreas, the
spleen, the diaphragm, and sometimes the lungs.  In the pig, the
proportion of the nitrogenous offal generally                                             eaten,        is greater than
in the other animals;                            but     its   proportion             of      fat   is   generally also
greater.
      With the higher per-centage                                of   nitrogenous substance, and the
 less per-centage                    of   fat,    in   the collective offal parts, they had in
variably          a   less per-centage              of  total dry substance, and therefore more
 of       water, than the collective carcass parts.
      From the composition                        of
                                                   the entire bodies  the animals analysed,

                                       352
    All   the experimental     evidence  conspired to show, that the so
called    “fattening”      of the animals    was   properly  so  designated.
 During the feeding or fattening process,       the per-centage of the col
lective dry substance of the body considerably increased;           and the
fatty matter accumulated in much larger proportion than the nitro
genous compounds.            The increase itself must therefore show        a
less   per-centage of nitrogenous substance (and of mineral matter
also), and a higher one of both fat and total dry substance, than the
whole body of the fattened animal.
    The knowledge thus acquired of the composition of animals in
different conditions of maturity, was next employed as a means of
estimating the composition of the increase gained in passing from
one given point      of progress to another.
    To this   end,  the composition of the animals analysed in the lean
condition, was     applied to the known weights of numbers of animals
of the     same description, assumed     to be in a similar lean condition   ;
and the composition of the fat animals analysed was in like manner
applied to the weights of the same series of animals after being
fattened.      Deducting    the amount of the respective constituents in
the lean animals, from that of the corresponding constituents in the
fat ones, the actual amount of each constituent gained was deter
mined.       The weight of the gross increase being also known, its
estimated per-centage composition was thus a matter of easy calcu
lation.     The composition of the increase of      98 fattening oxen, 349
fattening sheep, and 80 fattening pigs (each divided into numerous
lots), was estimated in the manner indicated; and as a control,
a statement is given      of the composition of the increase of the single
analysed fat pig, which,       at the time it was put to fatten, corre
sponded in weight and other particulars         most closely with the one
analysed in the lean condition.
    It  is concluded, that the increase in weight of oxen, taken over
six months or more of the <U+FB01>nal fattening period, may be estimated
to contain from 70 to 75 per cent. of total dry substance; of -which
60 to 65 parts will be fat, 7 to 8 parts nitrogenous substance, and
1  to  1%
            mineral matter.
    On the     same   plan of calculation,   the <U+FB01>nal increase    of  sheep,
feeding liberally during several months, will probably consist of 75
per cent., or more, of total dry substance; of this, 65 to 70 parts

                                       353
will  be fat, 7 to 8 parts nitrogenous      compounds, and perhaps l% part
mineral matter.
    The increase of pigs, during the <U+FB01>nal two or three months of feeding
for fresh pork, may be taken at 70 to 75 per cent. total dry sub
 stance, 65 to 70 per cent. fat, 6 to 8 per cent. nitrogenous substance,
and less than     1  per cent. of mineral matter.       The    increase  over the
last few months of high feeding, of pigs fed for curing, will doubtless
contain a higher per-centage of both fat and total dry substance,             and
a lower one    of both nitrogenous compounds and mineral matter, than
 that of the younger and more moderately fattened animal.
    As  a general result,  it appears that about   %ths    of the gross increase
in live-weight, of animals feeding liberally for the butcher, will be
 dry or solid matter of some kind.         About §-rds of the gross increase
 will  be  dry fat; only about     7  or 8 per cent. of the gross increase
 (and scarcely more than Tlvth of the total dry substance) will be
 nitrogenous compounds; and seldom more than 1%, and frequently
 less than   1 per cent. mineral matter.
    In the   case   of most of the   sheep, and    of all the pigs, the com
 position of whose increase was         estimated, the amounts of mineral
 matter, of nitrogenous      compounds, of non-nitrogenous organic sub
 stance,  of total dry substance, and sometimes of fat, which                were
 consumed during the fattening period, were determined;               so that the
 means are at command for studying the quantitative relation of the
 constituents estimated to be stored up in the increase, to those con
 sumed in the food which produced it.                    _
    Taking <U+FB01>rst the proportion of each class of constituents stored up
for   100  qf  the same consumed,      it is concluded, that       in the  case of
 sheep, liberally fed on a mixed diet of dry and succulent food, the
 increase of the animal will perhaps generally carry off less than 3 per
 cent. of the consumed mineral matter—somewhere                about 5 per cent.
  (varying according to the proportion        in the food) of the consumed
 nitrogenous compounds, and about 10 parts of fat for 100 non-nitro
 genous substance in the food; and lastly, that for 100 of collective
 dry substance of food consumed, there will          be,   in Sheep, about    8 or
  9 parts  of dry matter in increase stored up.
     The food of the fattening pig contained a much smaller proportion
  of indigestible woody <U+FB01>bre than that of the sheep ; and it appeared
 that the pig appropriated to its increase       a much larger proportion       of
                                                                2 B 2

                                          354
the organic constituents         of its food than the     sheep.    The   average   of
the estimates      for pigs, showed about 17 parts of dry substance of
increase     stored up, for 100 of collective dry matter of food con
sumed.       For   100    of non-nitrogenous      organic constituents in food,
about 20 parts of fat were stored up.               Of nitrogenous compounds,
when the food consisted of about the usual proportions of the legu
minous seeds and cereal grains, from              5  to 7  or 8 parts were stored
                                                                                       '
up for 100 consumed.             When    the leguminous seeds predominated,
the proportion of the consumed nitrogen stored up was less;                       and
when the cereal grains predominated, it was greater.                 The    estimates
showed, that on the average of the cases, there were 4 or                 5  times as
much fat stored up in increase, as there was of fatty matter supplied
in the food.        There was obviously therefore           a formation of fat in
the animal body.
    Reckoning     the amount of the respective constituents of increase
stored up,     for   100   of  the collective   dry substance of     the  food con
sumed, the general result was as follows             :—It    appeared,  that of the
about     9 parts of dry increase,      in  sheep liberally    fed on corn or oil
cake and succulent roots, for 100 of dry food consumed, about 8
parts were non-nitrogenous substance,            that is, fat.    There was there
fore only about        1  part stored as nitrogenous and mineral matters
taken together.          The  average   of the   estimates    showed the produce
of   100   of the collective dry substance of the consumed food of sheep
to be—about, 0'2 part of mineral matter, 0'8 part nitrogenous
compounds, and 8 parts fat, stored             up; leaving therefore about          91
parts to be expired, perspired, or voided.
    Taking the      average    of all the   estimates   of this kind relating to
pigs-of      the  17;}   parts of dry increase for 100 of dry matter of food
 consumed, about         15%  parts were estimated as fat, rather more than
 1-_1;rd  part nitrogenous       substance, and an insigni<U+FB01>cant          amount as
 mineral matter.         On this plan of calculation, therefore, there would
 appear to be,     in the case of fattening pigs, only from 82 to 83 parts
 of food-constituents expired, perspired, or voided, for                 100    of the
 collective dry substance of food consumed.
     It  is obvious that the ultimate composition of the dry substance
 of   increase   must be very different from that of the 100             of dry sub
 stance consumed.          This is strikingly illustrated       in the   case   of the
 fat.     In most of the experiments with pigs, the fatty matter in the

                                                355
food was determined.    On the average of the cases it amounted to
less than -<U+FB01>rth as much as was estimated to be stored up in the in
crease       of the animals.       There       was        therefore a formation
                                                      obviously
Q/‘fat in the body, from           some other constituent or constituents of the
food.        Supposing the       {Lths      or more of the stored-up fat which must
have been formed in the body to have been produced from starch,
it was estimated that it would require                   2%   parts of starch to contri
bute     l   part of produced fat.             Accordingly, it would appear that                  a
much larger proportion              of the consumed dry matter                is,   as   it   were,
directly engaged in the production of the dry fatty increase, than                                is
represented by the amount of the dry increase itself.
   Thus, taking the average of the cases in which the fatty matter
in the food of the pigs was determined,    was estimated that l7-4
                                                           it
parts of dry increase were produced for 100 of dry matter of food
consumed.    Of the 17'4 parts of dry increase, l6'04 are reckoned
as fat.        But there   were only 3'96 parts  of ready-formed fatty matter
supplied       in the food.        At least 12-08 parts of fat must therefore
have been produced from other substances.                       If from     starch,      it   would
require (at the rate of             211,-
                          parts of starch to of fat) 30'2 parts of 1
that substance for the formation of 1208 parts of the produced
fat.  The ready-formed fat and the starch, together, thus supposed
to contribute to the 1604 parts of fat in the increase, would amount
to 34'l6 parts out of the             100    of dry matter of food consumed.                   But
there were, further,            1'36 part of nitrogenous               and mineral matters
stored up in the increase.                  In all, therefore, 35'52 parts out of the
100  of gross dry matter consumed, contributed, in this compara
tively direct manner, to the production of the 174 parts of gross
dry increase.
  According to the illustration just given,                   it   appears that there was
pretty exactly twice as much of the dry substance of the foocf, in
volved in the direct production of the increase, as there was of dry
increase itself; hence instead of their being, as before estimated, 82
to 83 parts of the consumed                     dry   matter       expired, perspired,           or
voided, without as      it      were being directly involved             in the production
of the increase,     it    is   to be inferred that, in the sense implied, only
about 65 parts were so expired, perspired, or voided.
  It    having been thus found that by far the larger proportion                                 of
the solid       increase of the so-called fattening animals                   is    really     fat

                                          356
z'tself,—as moreover, it is probable that, at least in great part, the
fat formed in the body is normally derived from starch, and other
non-nitrogenous          constituents   of the food—and          since   the current
fattening foods contain such           a  very large amount of nitrogen com
pared with that eventually retained in the increase-—it can hardly
 be     surprising     that, contrary to the usually accepted           opinions, the
 comparative values of our staple food-stuffs are much more nearly
 measurable by their amount of digestible and assimilable non-nitro
 genous constituents, than by that of the digestible and assimilable
 nitrogenous compounds.
      In order     to determine     the relative development of the several
 organs and parts in different descriptions of animals, and in animals
 of the     same description in different conditions        of growth and matu
 rity, the weights alive, and of the separate i11ternal organs and some
  other parts, of 16 calves, heifers and bullocks, of 249 sheep, and of
  .59   pigs, were taken.
       It  appeared that in oxen        the stomachs and contents constituted
  about     11%,   in sheep about     7%,   and in the pig only about           1%  per
  cent. of the entire weight of the body.               The amounts of the intes
  tines and their         contents stood in the opposite            relation.     They
  amounted in the pig to about             6%, in the sheep to about        3%,  and  i11
  the oxen to only about         2% per cent. of the whole body.           These facts
   are    of considerable interest, when it        is borne    in mind that in the
   food of the ruminant         there is so large     a  proportion of indigestible
   woody <U+FB01>bre, and in that of the well-fed pig               a  comparatively large
   proportion      of starch—the      primary     transformations       of which     are
   supposed to take place chie<U+FB02>y after leaving the stomach, and more
   or less throughout the intestinal canal.
        Taken together, the stomachs, small intestines, large intestines, and
    their respective contents, constituted, in oxen more than             14  per cent.,
    in   sheep   a  little more than     11  per cent., and in pigs about        7%  per
    cent.    With     these great variations   in the proportion       in the different
    descriptions of animals, of these receptacles           and <U+FB01>rst laboratories of
   the food (with their contents), the further elaborating organs, if we
    may so call them (with their <U+FB02>uids), appear to be much more equal in
    their proportion in the three cases.         This is approximately illustrated
    in the fact, that taking together the recorded per-centages of
     “ heart and aorta,”
                              “lungs and windpipe,” “ liver,” “ gall-bladder

                                                          357
and             “pancreas,” “milt or spleen,” and the “blood,”
       contents,”
the sum indicated is for the oxen about 7 per cent, for the sheep
about 7+ per cent, and for the pigs about 6%rds per cent. Exclu
ding from this list the blood, which was more than £rd of a per cent.
lower in amount in the pigs than in the other animals, the sums                                                   of
the per-centages of the other parts enumerated would                                                agree    even
much more closely for the three descriptions of animal.
   With regard to the influence of progression in maturity and fatness
of the animal, upon the relative development of      several parts, the             its
results showed that the internal                           organs and other offal-parts pretty
generally increased                 in    actual weight             as   the animals passed from the

                              or
                              to     the very fat condition.                     The per-centage              pro
portion       to       the whole live-weight                   of   these offal-parts           as    invariably
diminished             as   the animals matured and fattened.                           The     carcasses,        on
the other hand, invariably                      increased, not only               in   actual weight, but
in   proportion             to   the whole body.
     The conclusion                is,   that   in   the feeding          or   fattening       of   animals, the
apparatus which                  subserves       for the reception and elaboration                          of    the
food does not increase                     commensurately with those parts which                              it   is
                                                           up
                   in of
the object                 the feeder      to   store           from that food.              These parts are
comprised                  the “carcass”             or   frame-work, with             its   covering    of   flesh
and fat.         Of the          carcasses which               thus constitute the greater part                    of
the increase, the nitrogenous portions                                increase but little, whilst the
fat                    in   very much larger proportion.                          Of the internal parts,

again,    it           also the     fat which increases most rapidly.
     The maturing process consists, then,                                 in   diminishing the propor
tional amount               in   the whole body,               of   the collective muscles, tendons,
vessels, fleshy organs, and gelatigenous matters—the motive and                                              func

          to                                                     of                                                of
which alone can increase the amount                                  of   or   replace the transformed
portions       of      similar matters          in   the human body.                It       consists, further,
in    increasing very considerably                         the deposition              of   fat—one          of   the
non-flesh-forming,                 but most concentrated                  of    the respiratory and               fat
storing constituents                 of   human food.
  It     is   then       in   our meat-diet,              of   recognized good quality,                 to   which
is    generally            attributed       such relatively high flesh-forming                          capacity,
that we carefully store                    up   such      a    large proportion           of   non-flesh-form
ing, but concentrated respiratory material.

  One   of the most important applications which can be made of a
knowledge of the composition of the animals which constitute the
chief sources of our animal food, is to determine the main points of
distinction between such food and the staple vegetable substances
which it substitutes or supplements in an ordinary mixed diet.
  By the analysis of some of the most important animals fed and
slaughtered as human food, it was found that the entire bodies, even
when in a reputed lean condition, may contain more dry fat than
dry nitrogenous substances.                       Of the      animals      “ripe” for the butcher,
a bullock and a lamb contained rather more than twice, a moderately
fat sheep nearly three times, and a very fat sheep and a moderately
fat pig about four times as much dry fat as dry nitrogenous matter.
Of    the professedly fattened animals analysed, a fat calf alone                                                 con
tained rather less fat than nitrogenous compounds.
   It was estimated, that of the whole nitrogenous substances                                                   of the
body, 60 per cent. in the case of calves and oxen, 50 per cent. in
lambs and sheep, and 78 per cent. in pigs, would be consumed as
human food.                 Of the total fat of the bodies, on the other hand, it
was supposed, that in calves and lambs 95 per cent, in oxen 80 per
cent, in sheep 75 per cent, and in pigs 90 per cent. would be so
applied.
                                                                                    fat be fat
  Assuming the proportional consumption of the                                                   and nitrogenous
compounds                   be
                   here estimated, there would
                       to        as                                                              in   the fat calf

analysed          13   time,            the fat   ox         times,                          lamb,              sheep,

and    fat   pig nearly                  times, and               the very    fat   sheep               6+   times     as
much dry fat  dry nitrogenous
                        as                                        flesh-forming           constituents            con
sumed        as
        human food.
  It would perhaps   hardly anticipated, that
                                        be        the staple   our                in                            of
meat-diet,         to
            which such    high  relative flesh-forming capacity
                                              a                                                                        is
generally attributed, there should      found such           be                      a       high proportion
of non-flesh-forming      flesh-forming  to
                                          matter                                  as      above indicated.
The result          of      such   a     comparison          as    present knowledge permits                           in
regard     to     the same point between the staple                          of   our animal food and
the more important                      kinds   of   vegetable        food, will certainly                     not     be
less surprising
  Of the staple vegetable foods, wheat-flour bread                                       is,      at   least    in   this
country,          the most important.                  It    will    be   interesting,                therefore,       to
contrast with this substance the estimated consumed portions                                                    of   the

                                         359
analysed animals.        To this end      some assumption must          be made    as
to the relative values (on the large scale), for the purposes of re
spiration and fat-storing, of the starch and its analogues in bread,
and the fat in meat.         It  is assumed that, in round numbers,           1 part
of fat may     be considered equal to 2% parts       of starch in    these respects.
If,   therefore, the quantity of fat in the estimated consumed portions
of the analysed animals be multiplied by 2'5, it is brought to what
                                                                    ” and in
may     be   conveniently    called its   “starch-equivalent      ;             this
way the Meat and the Bread can be easily compared with one another
in regard to the relation of their <U+FB02>esh-forming,             to their respiratory
and fat-forming      capacities.
    Reckoning      the amount—say        l per cent.-—of fat in Bread itself
(and    it probably   averages not more than           per cent.), to be equal to
2%   parts of starch, and adding this to the amount of the actual starch
and allied matters which it on the average contains, the calculation
gives—-assuming        this starch-equivalent       to represent specially       the
respiratory      and fat-forming,      and the nitrogenous        substances,    the
<U+FB02>esh-forming       matter—6'8 parts of respiratory and fat-forming to               l
of <U+FB02>esh-forming material in Bread.
    Taking the relation of the        one class  of constituents to the other,
in the estimated total consumed portions of the animals assumed to
be   in <U+FB01>t condition for the butcher, there        was   only one    case-that of
the fat    calf-in   which the proportion of the so measured respiratory
and fat-forming       to the <U+FB02>esh-forming capacity was in this our meat
diet lower than in Bread.           In the estimated total consumed portions
of the fat ox, the proportion of the starch-equivalent                of non-<U+FB01>esh
forming      matter to   l of   nitrogenous    compounds, was 6'9, or rather
higher than in Bread.          In the estimated consumed portions of the
fat lamb, the fat sheep, and the fat pig, the proportion                  was more
than     1%
             time as great as in Bread; and in those of the extra fat
sheep     it was more than twice as great. Taking the average of
the 6 cases, there were nearly 10 parts of starch-equivalent                to  l of
nitrogenous      compounds, against 6'8 to        1  in Bread.      In the half-fat
ox, and the half-fat old sheep, neither of which were in the condition
of fatness of such animals       as usually  killed, the relation of the starch
equivalent to the nitrogenous compounds               (assuming only the same
proportion      of the total fat   as before to be eaten), was        in the former
considerably, and in the latter slightly lower than in Bread, namely,

                                               360
as 3'83 to        l in    the half-fat ox, and       as   6'28 to       1   in the half-fat old
sheep.
  It will        perhaps be objected, that when animals are so far fattened
as to attain the relations above stated, the feeder                         is simply inducing
disease in the animals themselves, and frustrating that which, it is
considered, should be the special advantage of a meat-diet, namely,
the increase in the relative supply of the <U+FB02>esh-forming                            constituents
in our food.           It    cannot be doubted, however, that in animals that
would be admitted, by both producer and consumer, to be in only a
proper condition              of   fatness,   there would         be a higher       relation   of
non-nitrogenous              substance, in its respiratory and fat-forming                capa
city to <U+FB02>esh-forming               material, in their total consumed portions, than
in the        of our staple vegetable foods. It may be true, that
             average
with the modern system of bringing animals very early forward, the
development of fat will be greater, and that of the muscles and other
nitrogenous         parts less than would otherwise be the case; but it is
certain, that        if     meat is to be      economically         produced, so as to be
within the reach of the masses of the population, it can only be so
on the plan of early maturity.  Nor will it be questioned, that the
admixture with their otherwise vegetable                        diet, of the meat so pro
duced      is,   in practice, of great advantage               to the health and vigour        of
those who consume it.
   It   is   true that individual           joints or other parts, as sold, will fre
quently have         a      less   proportion of fat to <U+FB02>esh-forming matter than,
according to the above                   supposition, will be consumed.               Some     fat
will    also be removedin the process of cooking.                            But this portion
will generally still be consumed in some form.                               And where fresh
meat      is   bought, so also are suet, lard, and butter, which, either add
to the fatness of the cooked meats, or are used further to reduce the
relative <U+FB02>esh-forming capacity of the collaterally consumed vegetable
foods.
   It    would, indeed, appear to be unquestionable, that the in<U+FB02>uence,
on the large scale, of the introduction                   of animal food to supplement
our otherwise mainly farinaceou                  diet,   is   to reduce and not to increase
the relation of the nitrogenous                  or peculiarly          <U+FB02>esh-forming     to the
non-nitrogenous  constituents (reckoned in their respiratory and fat
forming capacity) of the food consumed.
   That,         nevertheless,       a   diet containing      a   due   proportion of animal

                                           361
food     is,   for   some reason or other,       generally better adapted to meet
the collective requirements of the human organism than an exclu
sively bread or other vegetable one,                   the testimony of common ex
perience may be accepted as su<U+FB02>icient evidence.                          Whatever      may
prove to be the exact explanations                 of the bene<U+FB01>ts arising from           a
mixed animal and vegetable diet,             it   is   at any rate pretty clear, that,
independently of any difference in the physical, and perhaps even
chemical relations of the nitrogenous compounds, they are essentially
connected with the amount, the condition, and the distribution                           of
the fat in the animal portions of the food.
     Fat    is   the most concentrated respiratory, and of course fat-storing
material also, which our food-stuffs               supply.       It    cannot be doubted
that, independently of the mere               supply      of constituents, the condi
tions of concentration, of digestibility,               and of assimilability        of our
di<U+FB01>'erent foods must have their share in determining                          the relative
values, for the varying exigences    of the system, of substances which,
in   a     more general or more purely chemical sense, may still justly
be looked upon as mutually             replaceable.
     By the aid of chemistry          it   may be established that, in the admix
ture of animal food with bread, the relation (in respiratory and fat
forming capacity) of the non-<U+FB02>esh-forming to the <U+FB02>esh-forming
 substances will be increased, and, further, that in such                     a   mixed diet
 the proportion            of the non-<U+FB02>esh-forming        constitutents, which will be
 in the concentrated form,           so to speak,       of fat itself, will   be consider
 ably greater than in bread alone. Common experience also testi<U+FB01>es
 to the fact of advantages so derived. It remains to Physiology to
 lend       her aid to the full explanation            of that which Chemistry          and
 common usage have thus determined.

            July 22, 1858.
       The researches of Gerhardt showed                   a   close   resemblance which
 exists between the monobasic organic acids and the metallic protoxides.
 We have the chloride of acetyl corresponding                      to the chloride     of the

                                                362
metal, and the hydrated and anhydrous acetic acid corresponding to
the hydrated and anhydrous oxide.                        These investigations have been
 succeeded    by others, which have had their origin in the consistent
development of these            ideas.        The following          discovery extends and
 completes these analogies.               I have to add a new- term to this series,
 of which hitherto       no analogue has existed.                     This term is the per
oxide of the organic radical,—the body which in the series of acetyl
corresponds to the peroxide of hydrogen or barium in the series of
the metal.     Of  these remarkable substances                   I have   prepared two,--the
peroxides of benzoyl and of acetyl;                      but the method by which these
are procured is doubtless             of extensive application, and              we may con
sider ourselves     as in possession of a class of bodies of                     a new order,
the study of which cannot fail greatly to extend our knowledge.
    These peroxides are prepared by the action of the anhydrous acid,
or the corresponding chloride, upon the peroxide of barium.                                It is
<U+FB01>rst necessary to prepare this peroxide in                      a  pure condition.     This is
e<U+FB01>'ected by precipitation          of the solution of the peroxide of barium in
hydrochloric acid by baryta water, and by drying in vacuo the pre
cipitate thus obtained.            The peroxide of barium thus procured is
perfectly pure, with the exception of                     a   trace  of carbonate.      In  ap
pearance   it  resembles      magnesia.
   To prepare the peroxide of benzoyl, the chloride of benzoyl and
the peroxide of barium are taken in equivalent proportions and mixed
in water.     A   mutual decomposition takes place                      ;  and a  substance is
formed which, after crystallization                   from anhydrous ether, gave the

as we have H,O water, and H2 02 or HO for the peroxide of hydro
gen. This body crystallizes from ether in large and brilliant crystals.
Heated a little above the boiling-point of water,                            it   decomposes,     with
a slight explosion and the evolution of carbonic acid. Boiled with
a solution of potash,     resolved into oxygen gas and benzoic acid.
                               it   is
   The peroxide of acetyl     prepared by mixing anhydrous acetic
                                            is
acid and peroxide of barium, in equivalent proportions, in anhydrous
ether.        The mixture       is    to be effected very gradually, being attended
with evolution of heat.                  The ether, after <U+FB01>ltration from the                   acetate
of baryta produced,            is     to be carefully distilled             off at   a   low tempera
ture, and the <U+FB02>uid which remains washed with water.                                       After three
or four washings, the water ceases to be acid, and                              a   viscid liquid re
mains, which        is    the peroxide of acetyl.                     This substance        possesses
the following properties:—It                     is   extremely pungent to the taste             ;   the
smallest portion          of   it     placed upon the tongue burns like cayenne
pepper.    The substance suspended in water immediately decolorizes
a  solution of sulphate of indigo.  It instantly peroxides the prot
oxide of manganese, and converts the yellow prussiate of potash to
the condition of red prussiate.                       Baryta-water          poured upon the sub
stance    is   converted to the condition of peroxide of barium, with for
mation of       acetate   of baryta.              Lastly,   a       single drop of the substance
itself, placed on     a    watch-glass and heated, explodes with                           a   loud re
port, shivering the         glass to atoms.
  To analyse the peroxide of acetyl, availed myself of its decom
                                                         I
position       by
           baryta-water.  An undetermined quantity of the sub
stance was thus decomposed, and the oxygen estimated which was
evolved by the decomposition                     of the peroxide of barium formed, by
platina-black,      and the acetate of baryta determined as sulphate.                                The
result    is   the same as though the peroxide of acetyl were decomposed
into anhydrous acetic acid and oxygen, thus,
                                 0,    H6   O,=C, H6 O,+O.
      Thus for every      16 parts        of oxygen evolved,            2   equivalents of acetate

                                          364
of baryta and l of sulphate of baryta, SO, Ba,, would                  be produced.
Now     we have

                      233'2     :   16    ::     l00    : 6'86.
    In the actual experiment 1'776 gr. of sulphate of baryta                    was
obtained, and 01225 of oxygen evolved.
                    l'776     :   (T1225       ::    100  :    6'89.
    It  has not yet been in my power to pursue further                 the study of
these substances.         I  may, however, observe,         that the peroxide of
acetyl contains the elements of carbonic acid and of the acetate of
methyl, and the peroxide of benzoyl the elements                  of carbonic acid
and    of the  benzoate    of phenyl.    I   have ascertained that the peroxide
of benzoyl, when carefully heated,           loses exactly one equivalent    of car
bonic acid;      but the substance formed, although isomeric with the
benzoate    of phenyl, has not the properties of that body. It is a
yellow resin, soluble in ether and alkalies, from which latter solution
it is precipitated by acids.
    The   existence    of a hydrated     peroxide may be anticipated, inter
mediate between the organic peroxide and the peroxide of hydrogen,
in the   same sense as the organic acid is intermediate between water
and the anhydrous         acid.    This substance in the         series  of benzoyl
would be isomeric with salicylic acid.              My efforts, however, to pro
cure these bodies have, as yet, been unsuccessful             ;  and it is to be re
membered that we have no evidence of the existence of a hydrated
peroxide of barium, or of any other metal, corresponding to the
hydrated protoxide.          In the    series   of ethyl the diatomic alcohol of
of Wurtz (02 H8 0,)         is isomeric with the hydrated peroxide.             But
the true peroxide of ethyl remains yet to be discovered.
   The question naturally         arises  as to what would        be the result   of
making similar experiments with the chlorides                 and the anhydrides
of the bibasic acids.          Now carbonic acid may be regarded as the
peroxide of oxalic acid: it is the constant product of the action of
oxidizing agents upon that body; and were we able to procure the
unknown anhydride           of oxalic acid, it would not       be an unreasonable
anticipation that with the peroxide of barium it would                   decompose
into oxalate and carbonic acid, thus
                      2 0, O,+Ba, o,=o, 0, Ba, +200,

  A     similar experiment with anhydrous succinic acid would produce
succinate      of baryta and            a homologue           of carbonic acid, the existence
of which is also indicated by other considerations. It is premature
to dwell upon this point; but in this direction also I have made
some experiments.

submitted        to   the Society several              months ago, suggested the                        proba

radicals similar        to   phenyl might              be   obtained          by   analogous processes.
  To establish this point experimentally,                                     Mr. Vincent Hall                   has
examined,             my laboratory, the deportment                                          of

fixing ammonia and                its   analogues.
     Mr. Hall has found that the crude naphtaline, such                                           as   it   is   ob
tained from the gas-works, submitted                             at   once, without sublimation,
to   the action, first       of    fuming nitric acid, and subsequently                                of   acetic
acid and metallic iron, furnishes the naphtylamine                                       sufficiently pure
for these experiments.                     The crude product                         thus obtained was
digested with bisulphide                 of   carbon        in   order        to   convert   into naph

     By distilling naphtylsulphocarbamide                          with anhydrous phosphoric
acid,    Mr. Hall       has obtained           a   beautiful          crystalline           compound         of   a

    Boiled with an alcoholic solution of naphtylamine, this compound
 readily reproduces naphtylsulphocarbamide, which by       insolubility                                its

     MY DEAR SIR,-The fact that the irritation of visceral nerves
sometimes causes arrest     of the movements of organs supplied by
them, as     shown by Edward Weber's experiment of stopping the action
of the heart by stimulating the vagus, and by Pflüger's more recent
observation that the application of galvanism to the splanchnic nerves
produces quiescence of the small intestines, appears to me to have
an intimate bearing                 upon the question how inflammation                                   is deve
loped through the medium of the nervous system at a distance from
an irritated       part; and          as the         nature      of the inflammatory process
has lately engaged             my especial attention,                    I    have been led to make
an experimental inquiry into this                     “inhibiting” agency, the true                           in
terpretation of which                is,
                                    you are aware, still subjudice.
                                           as                           now                              I
propose      to   state the principal results   which      have arrived, re
                                                                at              I
serving further details for                 a   more extended communication which                             I
hope soon         to   offer   to   the Royal Society.
     The view which has                  been advocated
                                                                     by      Pflüger*, and           I    believe
very generally accepted, viz. that there                        is   a   certain set          of nerve-fibres,
the so-called          “inhibitory          system        of   nerves” (Hemmungs Nerven
system), whose sole function                    is   to   arrest     or      diminish         action, seemed
to   me from the first         a    very startling          innovation                in   physiology; and
you may possibly recollect my mentioning                                     to   you       in   conversation,
when     in   London       last Christmas,            my suspicion that the phenomena
in   question were merely the effect                      of   excessive          action      in   nerves    pos
            of                             usually attributed                                      On further

compared with the relaxation                    of    the vessels caused                    by   stronger    irri
tants acting through the same nerves, confirmed my previous notions.

     WOL.   IX.                                                                             2    C

For   I  could hardly doubt that the cause of the quiescence              of the
heart or intestines on irritation of the vagus or splanchnic              nerves
was analogous to that         of arterial dilatation in    the web,    and that,
provided a     sufficiently mild stimulus     were applied to the so-called
“inhibitory     nerves,” increased action of the viscera would occur,
corresponding to the vascular constriction.
   To   test the  truth of this hypothesis, I made several experiments
between    the 17th of June and the 14th of July of this year, with re
gard to the movements           of  the heart  and intestines.      The    means
used for stimulating       the nerves and spinal cord were sometimes         me
chanical irritation,    but more commonly galvanism, applied with               a
magnetic coil battery of a single pair of plates, the strength of which
could be regulated in       a rough way, with great facility, by the height
at which the acid solution stood in the          jar and the extent to which
the rods of soft iron were inserted in the helix.            The mildest action
employed was such         as was     but just perceptible to the tip of the
tongue, placed between         the <U+FB01>ne silver-wire extremities of the poles,
when the rods were        fully in the helix, but inappreciable after their
complete withdrawal; the spring carrying the magnetic bar being
made to vibrate by a touch with the <U+FB01>nger: the greatest action of
the battery, on the other hand, was so powerful              as to elicit sparks
when the poles were applied to the tissues.
   My attention      was <U+FB01>rst directed to the intestines, and it may be
well to mention <U+FB01>rst all the results obtained with reference to them.
The animals      operated     on  were   generally rabbits, they being very
easily managed,      and also favourable for the purpose on account            of
the large amount of movement which                occurs in their intestines.
Chloroform     was generally not administered, on account of its de
pressing effect upon the action of the nervous centres.
   In the <U+FB01>rst experiment,         the ends of the   poles   having been <U+FB01>xed
to the    spinous processes of the ninth and twelfth dorsal vertebrae,
according to P<U+FB02>iiger’s original method, and the intestines allowed to
protrude through a wound in the abdominal parietes, a series of in
terrupted currents were transmitted, a very small amount of acid
being in the jar, and the rods fully in the helix.              The   effect was
complete    relaxation and quiescence of the small intestines, which had
been previously in considerable movement,            while the muscles of the
limbs were thrown into spasmodic action           ; but on the discontinuance

                                          369
of the galvanism the previous intestinal motion returned.                         The rods
were then removed from the helix, and the battery, thus diminished,
was applied on several occasions, with markedly increased action                           of
the intestines in every instance during the <U+FB01>rst twenty-<U+FB01>ve minutes.
In the next half hour the increaseof action from the galvanism, though
still distinct,   was    less   strongly marked;          and at the end of that
period, the rods having been reintroduced, the inhibiting in<U+FB02>uence
was also      found to be much less complete than before,                        indicating
that the parts of the nervous apparatus concerned were in                             a less
active condition, no doubt in consequence                of exhaustion.      The     arches
of the tenth and eleventh dorsal             vertebrae having been removed be
fore the experiments with galvanism,                 I   subsequently introduced            a
<U+FB01>ne needle into the exposed             part of the cord, with the eifect                   of
causing in repeated instances increased movements                  of the intestines,
which were especially striking on account of the occurrence of pecu
liar local contractions not       seen at other times.         Further observations
upon this animal tended to con<U+FB01>rm those which have been men
tioned, as did an experiment of the same kind performed the next
day upon another rabbit.
  I afterwards found that the best mode of proceeding was to re
move     the skin and one or two layers of muscles from                      a   portion of
the abdomen till the parietes were sufficiently thinned to permit the
intestines to be distinctly           seen through       them; by this           means     the
complication      produced by exposure of the intestines to the atmo
sphere was avoided, and the most satisfactory results were obtained;
the increase of the peristaltic movements                during the transmission of
extremely feeble shocks being strikingly                 apparent and constant on
every occasion.         During   the experiment performed in this way                         I
noticed several times that        a   violent struggle on the part of the rabbit,
when the intestines were in pretty free movement, was followed by
absolute and universal quiescence               of those organs for              several   se
conds;       this appeared to me of great interest, as proving that the
inhibitory in<U+FB02>uence is certainly sometimes exerted in the natural
actions of the animal, and is not merely the result of arti<U+FB01>cial sti
mulation.
  In the course of the above experiments several other observations
were made.   In the <U+FB01>rst place I veri<U+FB01>ed the statement of P<U+FB02>iiger,
that   if,    when the intestine        is   lying   relaxed under the inhibiting
                                                                    0
                                                                    is   C   0
                                                                             N

in<U+FB02>uence of galvanism applied to the spine,               a particular   part be
irritated, local contraction occurs, but is not propagated to neigh
 bouring parts.       This fact is of fundamental          importance, since it
proves that the inhibitory in<U+FB02>uence does not operate directly upon
 the muscular tissue, but upon the nervous apparatus by which its
 contractions are, under ordinary circumstances, elicited.
     Another point which seemed to require investigation was the well
 known increase of peristaltic action which takes place after death,
 and which      continues in spite of cutting o<U+FB01>' the mesentery          close  to
 the gut.      Those who believe        in a  constantly    restraining  function
 of certain    nerves   during   life might    argue that the intestine has
 always   a  tendency to such active movements,           but is kept in check
 by the “inhibitory nerves,” and released from their control when
 they have lost their power after death.          A different explanation, <U+FB01>rst
 suggested,    I  believe,   by Bernard, is that the increased action of the
 intestines is the result of failure of the circulation in the part; and
 to this view   I felt disposed to agree, in consequence of having noticed
 curious irregular contractions in the arteries of the frog’s foot from          a
 similar cause.     In order to    decide the question,   I tied  three adjoining
 arterial branches in the mesentery         of a rabbit, thus depriving about
 3 inches   of the intestine of its circulation    ; the parts so affected being
 accurately de<U+FB01>ned       by the extent of absence of pulsation in the mi
 nute vessels close to the gut.         In about   a minute and a half, vermi
 cular movements       commenced      in this part; the rest of the intestines
  being at the time very quiet.           Powerful   interrupted    galvanic cur
 rents were then transmitted through the posterior dorsal region of
 the spine, with the effect of causing perfect quiescence of the whole
 of the intestine, including the part whose arteries had been tied.
  After cessation of the galvanism the movements recurred in the por
  tion devoid of circulation, while elsewhere they were almost entirely
  absent.    This experiment was repeated on another occasion with
  similar results.    In   one of the  cases I  divided the mesentery     close to
 the gut, after ligature of the vessels, but no change took place in the
  character of the movements which had been previously induced, indi
  cating that the increased action in these cases had been of the same
 nature as that which results from death. The arrest of the move
  ment on the application of galvanism proved that the delicate opera
  tion of ligature of the mesenteric vessels had been performed without

                                        3'71
injury to the adjacent nervous branches;            and it therefore followed
that the movement in the parts supplied by those vessels was not
due to any injury of the nerves, but simply to the arrest of. circula
tion.     It further appears from these experiments, that, in whatever
way the cessation of the <U+FB02>ow of blood through the vessels operates
in increasing the peristaltic action, it      does so through the medium          of
the nervous apparatus, and not by directly in<U+FB02>uencing the muscular
tissue.     For, in the latter   case, the movement would have continued
in spite of the inhibiting in<U+FB02>uence, which,           as we have       seen, has no
 effect upon muscular      irritability.
     The fact that the movements continue in          a portion of gut deprived
 of its mesentery, proves that the nervous apparatus by which the
 muscular contractions are induced and coordinated in post mortem
 peristaltic action, is contained within the intestine.
     The distinction     between     the coordinating      power and muscular
 contractility was very strikingly shown in the further progress of one
 of   these experiments.       The peristaltic    movements     of the portion of
 gut supplied by the ligatured          arteries ceased entirely about twenty
 minutes after the vessels were tied, and the surface of the gut be
 came ‘there perfectly smooth and relaxed, contrasting                strongly with
 the wrinkled      aspect   of other parts.      But muscular irritability had
 outlived the coordinating        power, as was shown by energetic,           purely
  focal contraction    taking place in a part pinched.            Similar observa
 tions con<U+FB01>rmatory of this point were afterwards made upon a rabbit
 which had died of haemorrhage           an hour before.
     The mechanism by which the muscular contractions are regulated
 is,   doubtless, the rich ganglionic structure lately demonstrated in
 the submucous tissue by Dr. Meissner of Bz'ile*.              Professor Goodsir
 gave    me the <U+FB01>rst information        of this anatomical fact on my men
 tioning to him the foregoing physiological proofs of the existence
 within the intestines of a coordinating apparatus distinct from the
 muscular tissue.       I  have   since veri<U+FB01>ed Meissner’s observations, and
 found abundant well-marked nerve-cells in the submucous tissue of
 the Ox, exactly corresponding with his descriptions.
     But while muscular irritability outlives the coordinating                 power
 in the intestines, the latter lasts much longer than the inhibiting
                 * Henle  and Pfeufer's Zeitschr. 2nd series, vpl. viii.

                                                   372
property in the spinal system,                    for   I   <U+FB01>nd that P<U+FB02>iiger’s            experiment
does not         succeed        in a dead animal, unless performed soon                          after
death,      although       the intestines may continue to move                            for‘ a long
time.
   In another experiment                 I   divided with <U+FB01>ne scissors, at a little di
stance from the intestine, all the visible branches                             of   nerves in a por
tion of mesentery corresponding to an inch and three-quarters of the
gut, leaving the vessels uninjured.                         No   effect was produced on the
peristaltic movements,              which happened to be pretty active at the
time, and continued the same at the seat of the operation                               as elsewhere.
To   ascertain     whether the division of the nerves had been thoroughly
effected,    I   now transmitted             powerful galvanic currents through                   the
spine,   as in former experiments                  ;    when all movements              ceased in the
intestine, except in the small piece whose nerves had been cut, which
continued in' vigorous action as before.   The persistence of the
vermicular motion after complete division of the mesenteric nerves
shows that the movement which occurs during life, like that which
takes    place post         mortem,        is effected       by a mechanism within the
intestine;        and its continuance in the portion             of gut so treated,
while other parts were                 relaxed, on the application of galvanism to
the spine, proves that the inhibiting in<U+FB02>uence acts through the me
senteric nerves, whose integrity is necessary to the effect.
  This being established, it follows that                         if   a   quiet state of the      iri
testine, such as very frequently occurs in its natural condition, were
due to   a   controlling agency on the part of the so-called “inhibitory
system,” the complete division of the mesenteric nerves supplying a
portion of gut which              is   at rest, would liberate             it   from this restraint,
and movement would be the result.                           I    performed the operation in
one case under such circumstances, but the portion                                   of intestine con
cerned remained            as   tranquil     as   the rest.
  To sum          up the above,         it   appears        that the intestines possess an
intrinsic    ganglionic apparatus which                     is   in all cases essential        to the
peristaltic movements,                         of independent action,
                                    and, while capable                                              is
liable to be        stimulated or checked by other parts of the nervous
system;      the inhibiting in<U+FB02>uence being apparently due to the ener
getic operation of the same nerve-<U+FB01>bres which, when working more
mildly; produce increase of function.
  After the above conclusions had been arrived                              at, my attention was

                                               373
directed by Professor Goodsir to a paper by Dr.                            0. Spiegelberg,
published          last year, in which he shows that the movement of the
intestines is increased by mechanical irritation                        of the cord.        His
results are particularly          satisfactory, as having been obtained inci
dentally during an inquiry into the movements of the uterus, and so
without any preconceived theory*.                      Spiegelberg also attributes the
increased peristaltic         action after death to arrest of the circulation;
having found that the same thing occurs during life, when the aorta
or vena      cava      is compressed          above    the origin       of the    mesenteric
vessels.
  To proceed to the experiments upon the cardiac movements:
some of these consisted in irritation of the vagus in rabbits, and this
was followed by different results              in different instances: thus, on             one
occasion     the pinching of the cardiac end of the left nerve, divided in
the neck, was followed by considerable increase                         in the number of
beats as felt through          the walls of the chest, but similar treatment
of the right        nerve   afterwards caused          great depression of the heart’s
action.      Again, in one animal the evidence obtained from mechanical
irritation of the vagus          was      almost entirely negative.               In another
case, the left vagus having been                 exposed,      feeble    galvanic currents
transmitted through the nerve, isolated by a plate of glass placed
beneath      it,   were succeeded    by slight increase          in the number of con
tractions.         The strength of the battery            ‘having been      then increased
by introducing the rods into the helix,                 it   produced <U+FB01>rst irregularity,
and then complete           arrest of the action of the heart, which had been
previously exposed.  No sign of recurrence of contraction appearing,
I <U+FB01>lled the jar to the top with acid solution, and sent powerful‘
currents through the vagus, with the instantaneous effect of reviving
the action of the heart, which, on their immediate discontinuance,
continued to beat, though feebly, for several   minutes.   During this
timeI      again applied the galvanism very mildly, and the result was
great increase        in the number of           beats    on several successive          trials.
The apparent discordance of these facts is,       believe, partly owing

to diiferences in the state of the nerves in different cases as respects
irritability and exhaustion,             as   will    be better understood             from the
sequel; and, on the whole, the experiments appear to show that, in                            a
             *     Henle and Pfeufer’s    Zeitschrift, 3rd series, vol. ii. pt.   1.

healthy         state   of the nervous          system, very gentle irritation                               of the
vagus increases           the heart’s action, while a slightly stronger applica
tion diminishes the frequency and force of its contractions. This
conclusion is in harmony with an observation which I made inci
dentally upwards of a year ago, that irritation of the posterior part
of the brain of a frog with a <U+FB01>ne needle was repeatedly followed by
improvement in the circulation, whereas it was by the application of
a stronger stimulus, that of galvanism, to the same part of the
cerebro-spinal axis that Weber                    <U+FB01>rst induced an inhibitory                                 action
on the heart.
     It   is said,      on apparently good authority*,                             that division of the               -¢.L_.
vagus in mammalia is invariably                     followed by increase of the action
of   the    heart; this, if           true, would be a strong ground for believing
in an inhibiting            in<U+FB02>uence          constantly        operating              upon it through
this nerve.             But it is       also stated      that the                 same        thing does not
occur in frogs; and this circumstance appeared                                           to    me       to   throw
much doubt upon the evidence                       regarding mammalia.                              I   therefore
made       careful experiments on the effects of cutting both vagi, once
upon a calf and four times upon rabbits                          ;       taking the number of the
heart’s beats immediately before                      and immediately                     after section          of
each       nerve     by the momentary stroke of                           a       sharp pair of scissors.
In    no case was the rate increased at all by the operation, and the very
gradual diminution in frequency that commonly took place appeared
to depend on general exhaustion from other circumstances attending
the experiment.             In   one rabbit, in which                I   had removed the skin and
peetoralis major from the preecordial                          region,            so as to see          the move
ments      of   the heart distinctly through the transparent pericardium and
intercostal muscles,             I    noticed particularly                that the strength of the
contractions, as well            as   their frequency, remained quite unaffected by
the division of the vagi.                 From these facts                    I    feel warranted in con
cluding that, whatever may occur under exceptional circumstances,
there is certainly no constant control                               exercised           over       the heart’s
action through those nerves.
     The in<U+FB02>uence of the spinal                  system         upon the heart                   is,     however,
very apparent after           a      struggle, which almost invariably increases the
frequency and force of the beats; and                          I         found that this continued
                                          *   P<U+FB02>iiger,   op.   cit.

                                         375
to be the case after division of both vagi, implying that those nerves
are not the only channels through which this in<U+FB02>uence is transmitted.
 A new <U+FB01>eld of investigation         was thus opened.       For, supposing the
inhibitory agency to be     simply the greater action of an ordinary nerve,
it would probably not be       exercised    exclusively by the vagus, but also
 by the other nerves     connecting the cerebro-spinal axis with the car
 diac ganglia, viz. the sympathetic branches in the neck; in which
 case the action   of the heart should     be increased or diminished, accord
 ing to the strength of the stimulus, by the application of galvanism
 to the cervical region   of the spine after the pneumogastric       nerves had
 been cut.
    In  an experiment performed         with this view, the poles having been
 <U+FB01>xed to about the fourth cervical and <U+FB01>fth dorsal spinous processes,
 and both vagi divided in the neck, galvanic currents only just per
 ceptible to the tip    of the tongue       were   <U+FB01>rst transmitted.    This  ex
 cessively feeble action of the battery, though apparently not very
 favourably situated for in<U+FB02>uencing the cord, produced marked effects
 upon the heart's action, increasing the number of beats, which were
 about forty in ten seconds, by from three to ten in that period.           This
 effect having    been observed      for a considerable time, the rods    of soft
 iron, which had been      till then only inserted half-way in the helix,
 were pushed    fully in.   The battery, thus strengthened, instead of in
 creasing, as  before, the rate of the pulsations, diminished it by two
in ten    seconds    on several     successive   trials.  On  again  half with
 drawing    the rods, the galvanism,          when applied,     again increased
 the number of beats.         A little more of the acid solution      was after
wards poured into the jar of the battery, when the stronger cur
rents which     it produced reduced the number by about <U+FB01>ve in ten
seconds.
    Yet distinct   as was this    inhibiting in<U+FB02>uence, the shocks      were  still
quite tolerable to the tongue even when the rods were fully in the
helix.
    These results were of great interest, as proving how slight an in
crease   of the  feeble stimulus which promoted the action          of the heart
su<U+FB02>iced to produce the opposite (inhibiting) effect.              But it was by
no means clear that the in<U+FB02>uence had not been exerted through car
diac branches arising from the vagi above the parts where they were
divided, or even through         the trunks of those      nerves,  which might

                                     376
possibly have been affected       by the galvanism acting through          the
superjacent spinal column.         In  order to eliminate the vagi com
pletely,  I divided  in another rabbit all the soft parts in front of the
spine, except the trachea and oesophagus, at the level of the cricoid
cartilage, having previously out each carotid artery between two liga
tures.    The incisions  were carried fairly down to the bodies         of the
vertebrae, and outwards beyond the tips         of the transverse   processes,
so as to ensure the section not only        of the vagi and their branches,
but also of the sympathetic cords, with any <U+FB01>laments of those nerves
which they might contain.           Also the poles of the battery were
<U+FB01>xed to the spinous processes of the seventh dorsal and <U+FB01>rst lumbar
vertebrae,  so as to avoid all possibility      of direct action of the gal
vanism upon either the vagi or other cardiac nerves.              Feeble cur
rents being then transmitted, diminution          of the number of    beats to
the extent of two to four in ten seconds         occurred in several succes
sive trials, the results being so constant as to leave         no doubt that
they were produced by the galvanism.
   It may appear almost incredible that such extremely mild galvanic
currents, applied through the spinous processes of the posterior dorsal
region, should be capable of thus affecting the heart        ;  but that their
effects were really very considerable,      was clear from the further pro
gress  of this experiment and from others somewhat similar, which
showed that this apparently trivial       stimulation    gradually exhausted
the part of the nervous system through which the heart is acted on
by the cord.    Thus, in  one case, currents only     just perceptible to the
tongue, transmitted for about thirty seconds at a time through the
lower cervical and upper dorsal regions of the spine, at intervals of
nine minutes on the average during two hours and twenty minutes,
produced at <U+FB01>rst decided      increase  of the heart’s action, but during
the last hour failed to affect it at   all.    The strongest possible action
of the battery which,    as proved by other experiments, would, at the
outset, have entirely arrested   the cardiac movements,      was then set on,
but with no effect whatever on the organ.
   When partial exhaustion       has occurred, a much stronger galvanic
stimulus is required, to produce the same effect upon the heart, than
at the commencement       of an experiment;       and thus an action of the
battery which, when <U+FB01>rst -applied, causes marked diminution in the
 number of beats, may after a while come to have the opposite effect,

                                                 377
and increase         the heart’s action as decidedly as it had previously
lowered it     ;   while at an intermediate period it may seem to have no
in<U+FB02>uence at all.              This principle        gives    the clue to understanding
what had before appeared incomprehensible                          in   these   experiments,
showing that facts which               at <U+FB01>rst seemed utterly inconsistent, were
really perfectly harmonious.                 The       case before related,     in which   re
vival of the heart’s action resulted from powerful                       stimulation of the
vagus, which, had the organ been contracting as usual, would have
arrested its movements and probably <U+FB01>nally                          destroyed them, will
now be understood.              I   have seen other analogous cases of revival of
action by very powerful galvanism, which                         under ordinary      circum
stances would have arrested                it,   viz. twice in the heart and twice in
the intestines. The observation published so long ago as 1839 by
Valentin*, that mechanical or chemical irritation of the vagus in
the neck      of an animal recently                dead,    and with the nerves         conse
quently enfeebled,          causes    contraction of the ventricles, admits of              a
similar interpretation, as also does               a   corresponding fact regarding the
splanchnic nerves, given without explanation by Kupfer and Ludwig,
in   a   paper just publishedt, viz. that they lose their inhibitory in
<U+FB02>uence    a   certain time after death, and acquire                 a   motor power over
the intestines.
  Two more experiments require mention, as they exclude the
possibility of the agency in them, of either the vagi or the part of
the brain from which the vagi spring, having been performed upon
decapitated rabbits.            In   one    of   these cases, the carotids having been
tied near the head, the neck was completely severed behind the <U+FB01>rst
vertebra, care being taken to avoid haemorrhage                         from the vertebral
arteries,     and arti<U+FB01>cial         respiration,       for which provision        had    been
made, was carried on for an hour and                         a   half after decapitation.
The results of moderate galvanism, applied to the posterior dorsal
region of the spine, to which the poles had previously been attached,
were at <U+FB01>rst not distinct, but afterwards decided increase of action
was produced by          it   when applied at intervals during half an hour                 ;
the effect     being perfectly apparent in the heart which lay exposed
before me.          Exhaustion       of the      nerves    concerned’ having then taken

 place, the most powerful action of the battery failed to in<U+FB02>uence the
                                                                                        '
 character of the contractions.
    In  the other case, the poles having been <U+FB01>xed as before, and the
 head similarly removed, powerful galvanic currents were immediately
transmitted.        The pulsations      of the heart in the          opened    chest   at
 once fell from thirty-<U+FB01>ve       to sixteen in ten seconds, but rose again to
 twenty on the removal of the stimulus.
    Hence it is clear       that the sympathetic branches connecting the
 cord with the cardiac ganglia have equal claims with the vagi to be
 called “inhibitory        nerves.”     In fact this expression          seems to me
 altogether objectionable, since there is good reason to think that the
 same    <U+FB01>bres which       check   the   movements,       much more commonly
 enhance them.         The only   evidence afforded by my experiments that
 the inhibiting in<U+FB02>uence is ever exerted in the natural actions of the
 animal, consisted in the quiescence         of the intestines         sometimes    seen
 after a struggle, and two doubtful observations of retardation of the
'heart?s beats from the same cause.            Indeed it appears very question
 able whether the motions         of either of    these viscera are, under ordi
 nary circumstances, ever checked by the spinal system,                      except   for
.very   brief periods;     whereas the increased action of both heart and
 intestines, familiarly     known to result from mental emotion, may last
-for a very considerable time.            The fact that the           nerves   of  these
 organs are capable of setting them at rest under                        conditions    of
 extraordinary      irritation is   nevertheless    a matter        of great impor
 tance,   especially in     a pathological point of view,            and appears to
 afford an    explanation    of facts  in  medicine   hitherto     little  understood,
 —-such     as  failure   of  the  heart's action from violent emotion or
 pain,   and the constipation          which    attends strangulated           omental
  hernia.
    From the observations of Spiegelberg*, it would appear that the
 uterine contractions are promoted by mechanical irritation                       of the
 cord, and arrested by transmitting           a powerful      stream      of galvanism
 through the spine. Also the forcible expulsion of‘urine very fre
 quently seen in the lower animals in consequence of fear, and the
 temporary palsy of the detrusor often witnessed in the human sub
 ject in surgical practice as the result of severe injury, seem to me

 to imply that the bladder, too, while sometimes stimulated through
 the cerebro-spinal    axis, is paralysed by its very powerful operation.
 Hence it seems probable that the movements of all the hollow viscera
 are liable to similar in<U+FB02>uence from the spinal system.             At the  same
 time it appears to be a mistake to regard this in<U+FB02>uence in the light
 of  a strict control; for the experiments related in this letter show
 pretty distinctly that the contractions of the heart and the peristaltic
 action of the intestines are regulated, under ordinary circumstances,
 by the independent operation        of the intrinsic ganglia.
    Professor Schiff has,   I understand,     observed increase    of the heart’s
 action to result from very gentle stimulation of the vagus *, and has
 come to the conclusion, as stated by Spiegelberg            in his paper  before
 referred to,   that   the inhibiting in<U+FB02>uence         depends    upon   nervous
 exhaustion.     There are some circumstances which make me enter
 tain great doubt as to the correctness of this view.          In the <U+FB01>rst place,
 the very rapid recovery     of the cardiac or intestinal actions when the
 inhibiting galvanic currents are discontinued, contrasts strongly
 with the length of time that the impairment of function resulting
 from a protracted experiment, and certainly due to exhaustion, lasts
 both in the intrinsic cardiac nerves and in those that connect them
 with the spinal system.      Secondly, although very powerful galvanism
 not only arrests for the time, but permanently impairs the action of
 the heart, no such effect is observed to follow the inhibiting in<U+FB02>uence
 when it is caused by milder stimulation;            indeed, according to my
 experience, less injurious      effects  are produced     upon the heart by
 a protracted series    of experiments of the latter kind than by a cor
 responding set    with the currents still more feeble, that increase,
 while acting, the frequency of the contractions.               But if the dimi
 nished rate of the pulsations were caused by a partial exhaustion
 of the cardiac ganglia, an opposite result might              have been antici
 pated.
    Again, there   can be  little doubt that dilatation of the blood     vessels,
in  consequence    of a stimulus,    is due to an effect produced upon the
nervous centres for the arteries, similar to that experienced by the
visceral ganglia when subject to the inhibiting in<U+FB02>uence.                Now   an
in<U+FB02>ammatory      blush of long continuance may subside rapidly when

the source    of irritation is withdrawn.       Thus     I   have    seen redness
which had existed for about three days in the human skin in con
sequence    of tight stitches connecting    the lips    of   a   wound, give place
at. once   to pallor   on their removal.     Had    the arterial      dilatation in
this case been the result of nervous exhaustion continued during so
long a period, such speedy recovery could hardly, one would think,
have taken place.
  These and other considerations, to which              the already excessive
length of this letter forbids me to allude, induce me to think it
safest in the     present state of science to regard as a fundamental
truth not yet explained, that       one and the same afferent nerve may,
according    as   it is operating mildly or energetically, either exalt or
depress the functions     of the nervous    centre on which it acts.        It   is,

believe, upon this that all inhibitory in<U+FB02>uence depends,             andI   suspect
that the principle      will   be found to admit   of   a   very general applica

I. THE CaooN1AN Lac'rURE.—“                On the Theory of the Vertebrate
       Skull.”      By THOMAS H. HUXLEY, Esq.,/F.R.S.                Delivered
      June 17, I858.
   The    necessity  of discussing so      great a subject    as the  Theory of
the Vertebrate Skull in the small          space  of time allotted by custom
to a lecture, has its advantages      as well as its drawbacks.      As, on the
present occasion,     I shall suffer greatly from the disadvantages       of the
limitation,   I will, with your     permission, avail myself to the utter
most of its bene<U+FB01>ts.       It will  be necessary    for me to assume      much
that  I  would    rather  demonstrate, to suppose known much that              I
would    rather set forth and explain at length; but on the other
hand,   I  may consider myself excused from entering largely either
into the history of the subject, or into lengthy          and controversial cri
ticisms upon the views which are, or have been, held by others.

     The biological         science       of the last half-century                  is honourably
distinguished        from     that     of preceding             epochs,        by the constantly
increasing prominence of                               of plan is dis
                                      the idea, that a community
cernible amidst the manifold diversities of organic strudture.   That
there is nothing really aberrant in nature ; that the most widely dif
ferent organisms are connected by a hidden bond; that an appa
rently new and isolated structure will prove, when its characters
are thoroughly           sifted, to be only        a   modi<U+FB01>cation of something which
existed     before,——are propositions which are gradually assuming the
position of articles of faith in the mind of the investigators of ani
mated      nature, and are directly, or by implication,                           admitted among
the axioms of natural history.
     And this      is not wonderful;         for no living being can be attentively
studied without           bearing witness to the truth of these propositions.
The tyro in comparative anatomy cannot fail                            to be struck with the
resemblances between the leg and the jaw of                            a   crustacean;     between
the parts     of   the mouth         of   a beetle and those           of   a   bee; between the
wing of the bird and the fore-limb of the mammal.                                  Everywhere he
<U+FB01>nds unity of plan, diversity of execution.
     Or   again, how can the intelligent student                  of   the human frame con
sider the backbone,          with its numerous joints or vertebrae, and trace
the gradual modi<U+FB01>cation which these undergo downwards into the
sacrum and         coccyx, and upwards into the atlas                           and axis, without
the notion      of   a   vertebra in the abstract, as it were, gradually dawn
ing upon his mind; the conception of an ideal something which shall
be   a   sort of mean between these various actual forms, each of which
may then easily be conceived                  as       a   modi<U+FB01>cation of the abstract or
typical vertebra?
     Such an idea, once clearly apprehended, will hardly permit the
mind which it informs to rest at this point.                               A    glance at a section
of that complex bony box formed by the human skull and face,
shows that it consists of a strong central mass, whence spring an
upper arch and a lower arch. The upper arch is formed by the
walls of the cavity containing the brain, and stands in the same re
lation to    it,   as does the    neural arch of            a   vertebra to the spinal cord,
with which that brain            is   continuous.            The lower arch            encloses the
other viscera of the head, in the same way as the ribs embrace those
of the thorax.     And not only     the general analogy between the
                                               is

 two manifest,     but a young skull may be readily separated                into   a
  number   of segments, in     each  of which it requires but little imagina
 tion to  trace a sort    of family likeness to such        an expanded vertebra
                                                   '
 as the atlas.                       ,
    What   can be more natural then than to take another step—to con
 ceive the  skull as a portion    of the vertebral column still more altered
 than the sacrum or the coccyx, whose vertebrae are modi<U+FB01>ed in corre
 spondence with the expansion of the anterior                end of the nervous
 centre and the needs of the cephalic end of the body, just as those
 of the sacrum     -are  fashioned in accordance         with the contraction of
~the nervous centre and the mechanical               necessities of the opposite
 extremity of the frame’!
    Two generations have passed           away since, perhaps, by some         such
 train of reasoning as this, such          a conception     of the nature of the
 vertebrate skull arose in the mind of the philosophic             poet,   Goethe;
 and a somewhat shorter period has elapsed               since a poetical, or per
haps   I might  more justly say a fanciful, philosopher, Oken, published
a  “ Theory of the Skull” embodying such                a conception;    and since
the excellent Dumeril        allowed   a  like hypothesis to be strangled in
the birth by the small wit of a French academician.
    The progress of modern science is so rapid, that one is unac
customed to see half a century elapse after the promulgation of
a doctrine, which       is capable of being tested by readily            accessible
facts, without either its <U+FB01>rm establishment or its decisive overthrow.
But nevertheless,      at the present day, the very questions regarding
the composition of the skull, which were mooted and discussed                     so
long ago by the ablest anatomists of the time, are still unsettled; the
theory of the vertebrate skull is one of the most difficult and, appa
rently inextricably confused subjects, which the philosophic                anato
mist can attack, and in consequence,            not   a  few workers in science
look, somewhat contemptuously, upon what they are pleased to term
mere hypothetical      views and speculation.
   Indeed, though the germ of          a   great truth did really lie in these
same    hypotheses, its late or early development into a sound, and
consequently fruitful, body of doctrine depended upon the manner in
which biologists    set about solving        the problem presented to them;
upon the clearness with which they apprehended the nature of the
questions they wished to put, and the consequent greater or less
                                                                    2 n   2

<U+FB01>tness        of the method by which their interrogation of nature                                      was
conducted.
    I    apprehend that it has been and                        is,   too      often forgotten that
the phrase “Theory of the                   Skull”
                                      ordinarily employed to denote
                                                          is
the answers to two very different questions the <U+FB01>rst, Are all verte  ;
brate skulls constructed upon one and the same plan ?—the second,
Is such plan, supposing                it   to exist, identical with that of the verte
bral column?
    It       is   also     forgotten that, to       a     certain extent,           these     are       inde
pendent questions;                  for though an affirmative answer                    tolthe latter
implies the like reply to the former, the converse                                 proposition by no
means holds good; an a<U+FB01>irmative response to the <U+FB01>rst question being
perfectly consistent with               a   negative      to the second *.
    As there           are two problems, so there are two methods                          of obtaining
their solution.                 Employing the      one, the observer               compares      together
a   long series of the skulls and vertebral columns of adult                            V     ertebrata,
 determining, in this way, the corresponding parts of those which are
 most widely dissimilar, by the interpolation                          of transitional gradations
 of structure.                  Using the other method, the investigator                    traces back
 skull        and vertebral column to their earliest                       embryonic states, and
 determines the identity of parts by their developmental relations.
        It   were unwise to exalt either             of    these methods at the expense                    of
 its fellow, or to be other than thankful that more roads than one
 lead us to the attainment of truth.                       Each.      it   must be borne in mind,
 has its especial value and its particular                         applicability, though at the
 same time            it      should not be forgotten, that to one, and to one only,
 can the ultimate appeal be made, in the discussion                                  of morphological
 questions.               For   seeing that living organisms not only are, but become,
 and that all their parts pass through                         a     series   of   states before         they
 reach their adult condition,                it   necessarily        follows that     it   is   impossible
 to say, that two parts are homologous or have the same morphological
    *        Therewide difference, too, in the relative importance of either question
                     is   a
 to the student  of comparative anatomy.      Unless     can be shown that
                                                                      it      general               a
  identity of construction pervades the rnultiform varieties of vertebrate skulls,                             a
  concise, unifonn, and consistent nomenclature becomes an impossibility, and the
                     loses at one blow the most important of aids to memory, and the most
  anatomist
  in<U+FB02>uential          of stimulants to research. The second question, on the other hand,
  though highly interesting, might be settled either one way or the other without
  exerting any very important in<U+FB02>uence on the practice of comparative anatomy.

relations to the rest of the organism, unless we know, not only that
there is no essential       difference    in these relations "in the adult con
dition, but that there is no essential                difference  in the   course     by
which they arrive at that condition.              The study of the gradations of
structure presented by a series of living beings may have the utmost
value in suggesting homologies, but the study of development alone
can <U+FB01>nally demonstrate them.
    Before the year 1837, the philosophers who were occupied with
the Theory of the Skull, con<U+FB01>ned themselves,                   almost wholly, to the
<U+FB01>rst-mentioned         mode     of investigation, which         may  be   termed the
 “method of gradations.”              If they made use of the second method
at all, they went no further than the tracing of the process of ossi<U+FB01>
cation, which is but        a   small, and by no means the most important
part of the whole series of developmental phenomena, presented by
either the skull or the vertebral column.
     But   between the years        1836    and   1839,     the appearance     of three
or four remarkable Essays, by Reichert, Hallmann,                      and Rathke*,
inaugurated a new epoch in the history of the Theory of the Skull.
Hallmann’s        work on the Temporal Bone is especially remarkable for
the mass of facts which it contains, and for that clearness of insight
into the architecture of the skull, which enabled him to determine the
 homologies of some of the most important bones of its upper arch
throughout the vertebral series.              Rathke showed the singular nature
 of  the primordial cranial axis, and Reichert pointed out in what way
alone the character of its lower arches could be determined. For the
 <U+FB01>rst time, the student of the morphology of the skull was provided
 with a criterion of the truth or falsity of his speculations,                 and that
 criterion was shown to be Development.
     My present object        is to lay before you a brief statement            of some
 of the most important results to which the following out of the lines
 of inquiry opened up by these eminent men seems to lead.                          Much

     On examining      a section   of the cranium of     a sheep, made    either
  along a vertical     and longitudinal,     or  a transverse   and horizontal
 plane,  a more     or less completely ossi<U+FB01>ed mass is observed          in the
  middle line below, which forms part of the <U+FB02>oor of the cranial cavity,
  but extends beyond it.        This may    be termed the ‘craniofacial   axis.’
  Posteriorly it is a broad plate <U+FB02>attened from above downwards, and
 is nearly parallel with the long axis of the cranial cavity; but from a
 point immediately behind the sella turcica, it becomes thicker and is
 compressed      from side to side,      so that,  at  the anterior boundary
 of the   sella turcica,
                          the craniofacial axis is much deeper than wide,
 and assumes the form of a vertical plate. From the anterior boundary
 of the cranial cavity onwards, or in its facial portion, the axial plate
 is very deep and very thin, and a line drawn through its longitudinal
 axis would cut that      of the cranial cavity at a very considerable angle.
 The craniofacial axis then is naturally divisible into three regions;
 a middle thick part, lodging the sella turcica, and composed of the
 basisphenoid behind and presphenoid in front, the two being sepa
 rated by a suture     ; a posterior, lamellar, horizontally-<U+FB02>attened      part,
 forming in the young animal        a distinct bone, the basioccipital, bound
 ing the occipital foramen behind and uniting with the basisphenoid
 in front; and     an anterior laterally compresed       portion, composed    of
 the bony “lamina perpendicularis
                                          ” of the ethmoid   above and behind,
 united by the cartilaginous septum narium to the bony vomer below.
 This anterior division of the axis may be termed its ethmovomerine
portion.      Its posterior edge helps to close the anterior outlet of the
cranial cavity, from which it is otherwise completely excluded.
     The  sella turcica lodges the pituitary_body,     and the synchondrosial
union between the basisphenoid and presphenoid is situated so far
forwards that the anterior wall of the fossa is almost wholly formed
by the rostrum-like anterior prolongation of the basisphenoid.              The
spinal cord passes out behind the posterior margin of the basioc
cipital.    The olfactory      nerves  leave   the skull on each side of the
ethmovomerine division of the craniofacial axis.
    The walls of     the cranial cavity are formed by a number       of  bones,
which are divisible into two series, a Superior and a lateral.          Of the
latter, four pairs of bones, separated by natural lines of demarcation,
or sutures, are distinguishable, three of which abut directly upon the
cranio-facial axis, while the fourth pair are only indirectly connected

                                             388
with it. Behind are the exoccipitals *, united with the basioccipital,
and forming the lateral boundaries of the occipital foramen.        In
front of these are the petromastoids, complex bones which contain
the auditory labyrinth,           and are connected     with the anterior part of
the basioccipital        and     the posterior and superior part of the basi
sphenoid, only by cartilage.
     Next   come      the alisphenoids, which are attached to the infero
posterior        and the anterior portions         of the basisphenoid.             And,
lastly, the orbitosphenoids articulate with the upper margins of the
vertically elongated presphenoid.
     In the superior          series only four bones   can be counted,          of which
two are single and two are pairs.                  The hindermost is the supra
occipital bone.          It    articulates with both the exoccipitals and              the
petromastoids.          The next, in front, is the parietal, single in the
adult sheep,         but composed of two symmetrical halves in the lamb.
It   articulates with the petromastoids              and with the alisphenoids.
The frontals, or anterior paired bones, lastly, unite with the orbito
sphenoids, and, in front of them, with the ethmoid.
     Most important relations exist            between the contents           of the   era
nium and these constituent elements of its walls.                    The par vagum
makes it exit between              the   exoccipital and the petromastoid;             the
portio dura and portio     mollis enter the petromastoid;                      the third
division of the trigeminal passes through the large “ foramen ovale,”
which, in the sheep, has the exceptional peculiarity of being situated
nearly      in the middle of the alisphenoid;              the optic nerve         passes
through      a   foramen included between the orbito- and pre-sphenoids,
while, as has been mentioned above, the olfactory nerve passes out
beside the ethmoid and              in front of the orbitosphenoid.             The rela
tion of the pituitary body, or hypophysis cerebri, to the upper surface
of the basisphenoid,            has already been alluded    to;   it,   of   course, gives
more or less nearly the position of the third                   ventricle and crura
cerebri.         A   style passed horizontally      through    the corpora quadri
     * In  speaking of these bones       shall avail myself, for the most part, of the

‘useful translation    of the Cuvierian  nomenclature adopted by Prof. Owen.         It is,
 doubtless, more convenient to say “ alisphenoid ” than “ grande aile
                                                                              ” or “ aile

 sphenoidale,”                                            aile orbitaire,” the slightness
 of the real change thereby effected being one of its principal recommendations.

                                          389
gemina, or mesencephalon,         would strike against, or close to, the ante
rior margin of the petromastoid bone.
   On turning to the exterior of the skull, certain             bones    come   into
view which were before invisible,           as they take no share in forming
the lateral walls of the cranial cavity, but are,            as it were, stuck on
to   the outer surface      of  these walls.     The principal of these is the
great squamosal bone,         applied to the outer surfaces         of the petro
mastoid, parietal and alisphenoid bones, sending olf its zygomatic
process    to unite with the jugal, and furnishing          the articular surface
for the condyle of the lower jaw.
   Partly articulated with        the squamosal    and partly with the petro
mastoid, is the irregular capsule of the tympanic bone, to which the
tympanic membrane           is attached,     on whose    removal      the   ossicula
audit<U+FB01>s come into view, consisting of the malleus, incus, and stapes.
The    processus    gracilis of the <U+FB01>rst of these bones lies between             the
tympanic and the squamosal.              The short  process    of the incus abuts
against the inner wall of the tympanum, just below the squamosal
and close to the line of junction of the petrous and mastoid.                 These
are the leading points        in the structure of      the    sheep’s   cranium to
which    I  wish to direct attention at present.        Bearing them in mind,
let us now proceed to the consideration of the skull of a bird.
                 Composition    of   the  Skull of a Bird (<U+FB01>g. 2).
           Fig. 2.—-Longitudinal section of the Skull of  a young  Ostrich.
    In  most    adult birds,   as is  well known, the bones of the cranium
 have coalesced      so completely       as to be undistinguisliable.        But in
 the chick, and to      a greater     or less extent, in the adult struthious

                                                     390
bird, the boundaries of the various bones are obvious enough;                                             and
I   will therefore select for comparison with the mammalian skull
that of an ostrich, and that of a young chicken.
    The craniofacial axis of the bird                          has    the same general             <U+FB01>gure   as
that of the sheep,             consisting            of    a thick,         solid, median portion,
lodging the sella turcica          ;   of   a   posterior, horizontally, and of an ante
rior, vertically, expanded division; but it is comparatively shorter and
thicker in correspondence with the greater shortness, in proportion
to its depth, of the cranial cavity.                      The    sella turcica is very deep, and
its front wall is very thick.                   The lower            and anterior       half of this wall
is produced into a long tapering process,                                  which extends           forwards
far beyond the anterior limit of the bony lamina perpendicularis of
the ethmoid, to end in a point.
    Overlying this process, and articulated with more than the pos
terior half of its upper surface, there                              is,   in the ostrich,      a    strong,
thick, vertical, bony plate, narrower in front and behind than in the
middle, and below than above.                             A     curved vertical ridge on each
lateral surface marks the line of its greatest                                    transverse     diameter,
and seems to indicate             a     primitive              division      of    the mass        into two
parts, an anterior and           a     posterior.              The latter          is   connected       above
with the bony        plates representing the orbitosphenoids.                                  The former
exhibits on each side, posteriorly and superiorly,                                 a groove,       in which
the olfactory nerve rests and,                       above       this, expands into an arched
process, which supports the anterior extremity of the frontal bone.
Anteriorly, the superior               end      of    the bone widens into                 a   rhomboidal
plate, which        appears      externally between                        the nasal      bones.        These
anterior and posterior processes                          of   the    superior edge of the bone
are connected         by   a   delicate         ridge, which               passes from         one   to the
other above, but leaves an irregular oval gap below.
   The anterior edge of the bony plate in question                                   is   continued into
the unossi<U+FB01>ed septum              narium, ‘which                     below supports the delicate
bony representative           of the vomer.
    In   the chick, the whole           of the parts just described are unossi<U+FB01>ed,
but the composition             and     structure of the rest of the axis   essen                  is
tially    the same as in the ostrich.
    It   is   not difficult    to identify in the craniofacial axis of the bird,
parts corresponding with those which have been shown to exist in
the      mammal.       In     the chick, the basioccipital can be readily sepa

                                        391
rated from the basisphenoid.            The latter has the      same relation to
the sella turcica in the bird      as in the mammal; and only differs from
it in that singular beak-like       process, into which its inferior portion is
prolonged anteriorly, and which is produced, according to Kiilliker *,
by the coalescence with the basisphenoid of a distinct ossi<U+FB01>cation,
which is developed in the presphenoidal cartilage and partially repre
sents    the presphenoid of the mammal.                The rest of the presphe
noidal cartilage is more or less completely ossi<U+FB01>ed, and appears to be
represented in the ostrich by that part of the
                                                          “ vertical bony plate ”
which lies behind the curved ridge referred to above; while that
part of the plate which is situated in front of the ridge, answers to
 the lamina perpendicularis of the ethmoid.
    Nothing    can be more variable, in fact, than the mode              in which
 the ossi<U+FB01>cation of the presphenoidal and ethmoidal portions of the
 craniofacial axis takes place in birds; while nothing              is more con
 stant than the general form preserved             by these regions, and their
 relation to other parts, irrespectively of the manner in which ossi<U+FB01>
 cation takes place in them.            And in    these   respects  birds do but
 typify the   rest of the oviparous      Vertebrata.
    If   we compare      the inferolateral walls of the ostrich’s cranium
 with   those  of the   sheep, we <U+FB01>nd the most singular correspondences.
 Posteriorly are the exoccipitals, which contribute to form the single
 condyloid    head for articulation      with the   atlas, but otherwise present
 no important      differences.     In front of the exoccipital lies      a consi
 derable bony mass, which unites, internally and inferiorly, with the
 basioccipital and basisphenoid bones, and posteriorly is con<U+FB02>uent
 with the exoccipitals.         Its anterior margin is distinguishable into
 two portions, a superior and an inferior, which meet at an obtuse
 angle.    The anterior inferior portion articulates with the alisphenoid;
 the anterior superior portion with the parietal.              The anterior, pos
 terior and inferior, relations of this bone are therefore the same             as
 those of the petromastoid        of the   sheep.
    Superiorly and posteriorly,       a well-marked groove (which, however,
 is not a suture) appears to indicate the line of demarcation between
 the supraoccipital and this bone, whose pointed upper extremity
  appears consequently to be wedged in between the supraoccipital and
  the parietal.

    The par vagumpasses out                   between          the bony mass under descrip
tion and the exoccipital;               the third division         of    the trigeminal        leaves
the     skull    between         it and the alisphenoid.           The portio duraand              the
portio mollis enter it by foramina very similarly disposed to those in
the sheep.            Superiorly there is       a fossa on the       inner face of the bone,
which corresponds with                a more     shallow depression            in the sheep, and,
like     it,   supports     a     lobe of the cerebellum.                Finally, the anterior
inferior edge of the bone traverses                        the middle of the fossa which
receives the mesencephalon.                    In   every relation       of importance, there
fore,    this bony mass corresponds exactly with the petromastoid of
the sheep, while            it   differs from      it    only in its union with the exocci
pitals and the supraoccipital posteriorly,                        and its contact with the
craniofacial axis below.
    If   from the ostrich we turn to the young chick (<U+FB01>g. 3), the con
dition of this part of the walls of the skull will be found to be still
more instructive.                The general connexions of           the corresponding bony
mass,     Pt. M. Ep.,            are as in the      ostrich;      but while      it   is   even more
evident        that the groove appearing to separate its upper end from the
supraoccipital     no longer
                       is     real suture (whatever
                                        a             may have been),         it
a   most distinct and clear suture, of which no trace   visible in the           is
ostrich’s skull, traverses the bone at                     a   much lower point, dividing           it
into an inferior larger piece, united with the exoceipital, and                              a   supe
rior portion, anchylosed with the supraoccipital.                             The latter contains
the upper portions of the superior and external semicircular canals.
    Moreover, on endeavouring to separate the inferior bone from the
exoceipital,      it    readily parts along         a    plane which traverses the fenestra
ovalis externally, and the anterior boundary of the foramen of exit
of the par vagum internally. The posterior smaller portion remains
firmly adherent to the exoceipital, while the other larger portion
comes away as           a   distinct bone.
    The latter         answers      exactly to the mammalian petrosal, while the
small posterior segment                corresponds with- the mammalian mastoid.
Like that of             the     mammal,      it    is   eventually anchylosed with               the
petrosal;        but unlike that of            the mammal,          it   is   also, and     indeed at
an earlier period, con<U+FB02>uent with the exoccipital*.
    Thus, to return to the ostrich’s skull, the bony mass interposed
between         the    exoceipital, supraoccipital and parietal bones, and the
                                          *   See Note      I.

mammal,            is   admitted by all anatomists.                   The       bone which lies imme
diately in front of the petrosal                     is,   with   a   no less fortunate unanimity,
admitted to be the homologue                        of the mammalian alisphenoid.                       But   it
is worthy of particular remark, in reference to the shifting of the
relative positions of the lateral elements of the cranial wall, which
has been imagined to take place in the ovipara, in consequence                                          of   the
supposed invariable disappearance                          of   the squamosal            from the interior
of their skulls; that although precisely the same bones are visible
on the inner surface of the cranial cavity in the ostrich as in the
sheep, the squamosal                   being absent in both, yet in the ostrich the
third division of the trigeminal                      does not pass through the middle                        of
the alisphenoid, but between                    it   and the petrosali‘.
      The orbitosphenoids appear like                       mere processes          of   the presphenoid,
and their relation to the optic nerves                                is   altered in the same way
(when compared with the corresponding bones in the sheep) as that
of the alisphenoids to the trigeminal, that to say the nerves pass         is
behind, and not through them.
      The superior            series    of   bones         in the cranial           wall    is   exactly the
same         as    in the sheep, and the parietals are distinct in the young
ostrich,          as   in the lamb.
      Attached           to   the exterior of the skull of the ostrich are,                              as   in
the sheep, several bones;                     but the appearance                    of   some    of   these       is
widely different from that of the parts which                                    correspond with them
in the mammal.                  This    is   least the case with the largest and upper
most of these bones,                   which        lies upon the parietal above,                      the ali
sphenoid in front, and the exoccipital behind                                   ;   while internally         it   is
in relation with the petromastoid.
   This bone lies immediately above                               an articular           surface,     which       is
furnished to the os quadratum-by the petrosal, and more remotely
   * My reasons for considering this osseous element to be distinct from the
supraoccipital will be given below.

Except   in this particular, however, the bone in question resembles
in every essential relation the squamosal of the sheep, while to the
same extent it differs from the mastoid of that animal.
     I   have stated    that in the ostrich this bone does not appear upon
the inner surface of the wall of the skull, and in this respect, while
it   resembles    the squamosal       of the   sheep and Ruminants         generally,
t differs from that of most other Mammalia,                   in which the squa
mosal makes its appearance              in the interior     of the skull,    between
the parietal, frontal, alisphenoid and petrosal bones, and so con
tributes more or less largely to the completion of the cranial wall.
     But it has        been    most strangely forgotten that the relations of
the bone in question in birds, are by no means always those which
obtain in the ostrich.  In the young of the commonest and most
accessibleof domestic birds, in the chicken, the squamosal may be
readily seen to enter largely into the cranial wall; a rhomboidal
portion of its anterior and internal surface being interposed in front
of the petrosal,        between    this bone, the parietal, the frontal, and the
alisphenoid (Sq. <U+FB01>g. 3).
             Fig. 3.—Longitudinal section of the Skull of   a young   Chicken.
   There is therefore not a single relation (save the connexion of
the jngal) in which this bone does not resemble the squamosal of the
Mammalia-there                is not one in which it does not differ from their
mastoid.                                        '
     The    second     bone applied externally to the         cranium in the bird,
is that large and important            structure, the os quadratum, which in

                                       395
tervenes   between    the petrosal and squamosal bones above, and the
articular portion of the lower jaw below;          which articulates with the
pterygoid internally, and with the quadratojugal             externally, which
 gives  attachment to a part of the tympanic membrane              posteriorly,
 and which is very generally termed the tympanic bone, from its
supposed homology with the bone so named in the Mammalia.                  The
 resemblance    to the tympanic bone, however, hardly extends           beyond
its relation to the tympanic membrane          ;  for in no other of the par
 ticulars mentioned above do the connexions of the two bones cor
respond.      The tympanic of the mammal does not articulate with the
lower jaw, nor with the pterygoid*, nor with the jugal or quadrato
jugal. On the other hand, if the connexions of the tympanic mem
brane were sufficient to determine the point, not only the quadratum,
but the articular element of the lower jaw, and even some cranial
bones, must be regarded as tympanic1-.
    Again,   if  we trace    the modi<U+FB01>cations which        the tympanic bone
undergoes in the mammalian series, we <U+FB01>nd that in those mammals,
such   as Echidna     and   Ornithorkynchus,     which    approach nearest   to
the Ovipara, and which should therefore furnish us with some hint
of the modi<U+FB01>cations       to which the tympanic       bone is destined in that
group, the bone,       so far from     increasing in size and importance,
and taking      on  some    of the connexions which it exhibits in the
oviparous     Vertebrata,      absolutely   diminishes     and becomes    rudi
mentary, so that the vast bony capsule             of the placental mammal
is reduced, in the monotreme, to a mere bony ring.
    But it is  no less worthy   of remark, that in    these very same animals
the malleus and incus have attained dimensions out of all proportion
to those which they exhibit in other mammals, and that they even
contribute to the support of the tympanic membrane.
    So far, therefore, from being prepared by the study of those
Mammalia which most nearly approach the Ovipara, to <U+FB01>nd, in the
                                                                                ‘
most highly organized of the latter, an immense os tympanicum,
with   a vanishing    malleus and incus, we are, on the contrary, led to
anticipate the disappearance         of the tympanicum, and the further
enlargement of the       ossicula auditus.     Thus far the cautious appli
cation of the method of gradations leads us, and leads us rightly

  though      the demonstration       of the justice of its adumbrations can
  only be    obtained by the application of the criterion of development.
     It  is twenty-one years since this criterion was applied by Reichert.
  Since his results were published, they have been, in their main fea
  tures, veri<U+FB01>ed and adopted by Rathke, the <U+FB01>rst embryologist of his
  age; and yet they          are ignored, and the       quadratum of the bird is
  assumed to be the tympanic             of the mammal, in         some  of the most
  recent,    if  not the newest     discussions of the subject.         Reichert    and
  Rathke have proved, that in the          course   of the development of either
  a mammal or a bird, a slender cartilaginous rod makes its appearance
  in the <U+FB01>rst visceral arch,     and eventually unites    with its fellow,   at a point
  corresponding with the future symphysis of the lower jaw.                      Supe
'
  riorly, this rod is connected with the outer surface of the cartilage,
  in which        the petrosal    bone subsequently        makes its     appearance.
  Near its proximal         end,  the rod-like “ mandibular cartilage”            sends
  off another slender cartilaginous process, which extends forwards
  parallel with the base of the skull. With the progress of develop
  ment, ossi<U+FB01>cation takes place in the last-named cartilage, and con
  verts it, anteriorly, into the palatine, and posteriorly, into the ptery
  goid bone.         The mandibular      cartilage itself becomes        divided into
  two portions, a short, proximal, and a long, distal, by an articulation
  which makes its appearance just below the junction of the pterygo
  palatine cartilage.       The long distal division is termed, from the name
  of its original discoverer, Meckel’s          cartilage.     It  lengthens, and an
  ossi<U+FB01>c deposit takes place around,             but, at <U+FB01>rst, not in it.           The
  proximal       division in the mammal ossi<U+FB01>es, but usually loses its con
  nexion with the pterygoid, remains very small and becomes the incus.
  In  the   bird the corresponding        part enlarges, ossi<U+FB01>es, and becomes
  the os quadratum, retaining its primitive            connexion with the ptery
  goid.     In the mammal, the proximal          end   of Meckel’s cartilage       ossi
  <U+FB01>es and becomes         the malleus, while the rest ultimately disappears.
  The ossi<U+FB01>c       mass which is formed around         Meckel’s cartilage remains
  quite distinct from the proximal end of that cartilage, or the malleus,
  gradually      acquires the form of the ramus of the lower jaw,                   and
  eventually developes        a condyle   which    comes    into contact and arti
  culates    with,    the  squamosal.     In the bird,       on   the contrary,      the
  ramus of the jaw unites with the ossi<U+FB01>ed proximal end of Meckel’s
  cartilage    ;  which becomes anchylosed with the ramus, but retaining

    cartilage, ossify, while the rest                           of   the cartilaginous              arch disappears
    and       is   replaced         bya    bony ramus deposited round                         it.      But from this
    point the mammal and the bird diverge.                                           In   the former, the                 in
    cudal and Meckelian elements are                                 so   completely applied              to   the   pur
    poses          of   the organ         of    hearing, that they are                   no   longer capable               of
    supporting               the ramus, which eventually comes into contact with the
    squamosal bone.                      In    the latter, they only subserve audition                               so   far
    as    they help            to   support the tympanic membrane, their predominant
    function being the support                        of   the jaw.
      The tympanic bone                          of   every mammal                is,    at   first,           flat, thin,

curved plate           of     osseous      matter, which appears on the outer side                        of
the proximal end  of Meckel's cartilage, but is as completely indepen
dent of it as is the ramus of the jaw of the rest of that cartilage.
In most birds it has no bony representative*.
  It    is clear, then, as Professor Goodsirt has particularly stated, that
the os quadratum of the bird is the homologue of the incus of the
mammal, and has nothing to do with the tympanic bone; while the
apparently missing malleus of the mammal is to be found in the
os articulare of the lower jaw                        of the bird.
  It    would lead me too far were                         I   to pursue the comparison of the
bird’s skull with that of the mammal further.                                        But sufficient has
been said,         I   trust, to prove that, so far as the cranium proper is

cerned, there is the most wonderful harmony in the structure of the
two, not a part existing in the one which is not readily discoverable
in the    same position, and performing                          the same essential functions, in
the other.             I have the          more willingly occupied a considerable time
in the demonstration of this great fact,                              because     it must   be universally
admitted          that the bones which                     I have       termed petrous, squamosal,
mastoid, quadratum,                   articulare in the bird, are the homologues                          of
particular bones in other oviparous Vertebrata,                                    and consequently,      if
these determinations                  are correct in the bird, their extension to the
other Ovipara is a logical necessity.                             But the determination of these
bones throughout the vertebrate series                            is the keystone of every theory
of the skull—it is the point upon which     further reasoning must        all
turn; and therefore          them,    considering the skulls

the cranial wall, visible from within, is formed by bone, and that the
large anterior moiety is entirely cartilaginous and unossi<U+FB01>ed.                                           The
anterior part of the posterior, bony, moiety of the cranial wall is
formed by      a bone         (Pt.), whose long, vertical, anterior-inferior margin
forms the posterior boundary of the foramen by which the third divi
sion of the trigeminal nerve makes its exit from the skull.                                   The       ante
rior and superior margin of the bone is very short, and articulates with
the parietal bone.  The superior margin is inclined backwards, and
articulates with the supraoccipital.                            The posterior margin is straight,
and abuts against a cartilaginous                             plate interposed between this bone
and that which succeeds                        it.       The inner    face   of the   bone        is,   as   it
were, cut short and                 replaced             by   this cartilage, whence the inferior
edge   is   also short and             is    connected          only with the basisphenoid, and
not with the basioccipital.                          The anterior margin of           the bone           cor
responds with the middle of the inesencephalon, while its inner face
presents apertures for the portio dura and portio mollis.                                The pos
terior margin of its outer face forms half the                               circumference of the
fenestra ovalis, and               it     contains the            anterior and inferior        portions

tion is also     the petrosal, and af<U+FB01>rm it to be an alisphenoid.               The
general adoption of such a view would,                  I  do not hesitate to    say,
throw the Theory of the Skull into a state of hopeless confusion,
and render a consistent terminology impossible.                   Where then is the
alisphenoid?        I  reply, that it is unossi<U+FB01>ed.           The posterior portion
of the cartilaginous side-wall of            the    skull, in fact, unites with the
parietal, the petrosal, and the basisphenoid, just in the same way as
the bony alisphenoid of the bird unites with those bones.                   Further
more,     as  in the bird, it bounds the foramen for the third division of
the trigeminal        nerve   anteriorly, and is specially perforated by the
second     division of the <U+FB01>fth, while the optic and the other divisions
 of the <U+FB01>fth      pass out in front of or through its anterior margin.
     Not only is    the   alisphenoid cartilaginous, but the orbitosphenoid
is in the same condition, and           a great     vertical plate of cartilage re
presents the whole anterior part of the craniofacial axis, or the pre
sphenoid and ethmovomerine bones*.                   It  has been imagined, indeed,
that the rostrum-like            termination    of    the   basisphenoid represents
 the   presphenoid, but        I   think this    comes     of studying dry skulls.
 Those who compare          a section   of  the   fresh skull of a turtle with the
 like section of the skull of a lamb, will hardly fail to admit that the
 rostrum of the basisphenoid in the turtle is exactly represented                  by
that part of the sheep’s basisphenoid, which forms the anterior and
 inferior boundary of the sella turcica, and that the suture between
 the basisphenoid and the presphenoid in the sheep corresponds pre
 cisely with the line of junction            between      the rostrum   of the  basi
 sphenoid and the presphenoidal cartilage in the turtle.
     Connected with the posterior edge of the petrosal by the carti
 laginous plate, which has been referred to above, and between this
 and the exoccipital, there appears, on the inner aspect of the longi
 tudinal section of the turtle’s skull,         a  narrow plate of bone connected
 above, with the supraoccipital,           behind, with the exoccipital, below,
 with the basioccipital, and leaving between its posterior margin and
 the exoccipital an aperture whereby the par vagum leaves the skull.
 In fact,    except in being separated from the petrosal by cartilage, this
 bone presents      all the characters of the mastoid of the bird, which it
 further     resembles    in forming one-half of the circumference of the

~fenestra     ovalis.        In other       respects     it is more like the mastoid of the
 sheep, for      it is not anchylosed with the exoccipital                          ;   it is produced
 externally into a great bony apophysis, which gives                                    attachment to
 the representative of the digastric muscle;                          and it is largely visible
 external to the exoccipital, when the skull is viewed                                  from behind.
 Indeed, the resemblance                              of the mammal is more
                                            to the mastoid
 striking      than that to        the corresponding bone in the bird. And I
 think it is hardly possible for any unprejudiced person to rise from
 the comparison of the chelonian skull with that of the mammal, with
 any doubt on his mind                 as to     the homology of the two bones.
      When the     sheep’s        skull is viewed from behind, the posterior half
 of the     squamosal        is seen entering into its outer boundary above the
 mastoid.        On regarding the turtle’s skull in the same way, there is
 seen,      occupying the          same          position, the bone which                Cuvier, as    I
 venture to think, most unfortunately,                        named “mastoid.”                 But    if
 the arguments brought forward above be, as                                I   believe with     Hall
 mann, they are, irrefragable, this bone cannot be the mastoid;                                   and
 I    can   discover no valid reason                   why it should not be regarded as
 what its position and relations naturally suggest it to be—the squa
 mosal.        Its connexions with the mastoid, petrosal,                           and    quadratum
 are      essentially the same as those of the squamosal in                         the bird and the
 mammal.          The quadratum                  and    articulate of the turtle are on all
 hands admitted to be the homologues of the similarly-named                                     bones
 in the bird, and therefore all the reasonings which applied to the
 one apply to the other.  When the petrosal, mastoid, and squamosal
 are determined in the turtle, they are determined in all the                                Reptilia.
 But the Grocodilia, Lacertilia,                    and Oplzidia differ from the turtle and
 Chelonia generally, in that their mastoid                     is,   as   in the bird, anchylosed
 with the exoccipital.             The      squamosal,       again, which in the Crocodilia
 essentially resembles            that of the turtle, becomes                  a   slender and elon
 gated bone  in the Lacertilia, and still more in the Ophidia, in
 which the quadratum   carried at its extremity *.

      In the Amphibia the petrous and mastoid                         have the same relations
 as   in the Reptilia        ;   but   it   is   interesting to remark, that in some Am
phibia the anterior margins of                     the petrosal encroach            upon the lateral

geminal, just         as   the posterior margin of the alisphenoid encroached
so as to enclose            it,   in the      sheep.     It    can be hardly              necessary       to
remark, however,              that this result has nothing to do with the disap
pearance       of any   element in the postero-lateral cranial walls, which have
the same composition in the frog                   as   in the crocodile or lizard.
     The determination of the homologues of the                           squamosal,           incudal,
Meckelian, and tympanic elements                        in the amphibian skull                is   by no
means an easy matter, but one                      requiring      a    much more careful in
vestigation than           it   has yet received.
     In lllammalia,        a    second arch, the hyoid,          is   connected      with the outer
surface       of the skull, immediately behind the mandibular, and more
particularly with that of the mastoid bone or its rudiment.                                           The
proximal        end     of this arch (which              is,   at <U+FB01>rst, like        the mandibular
arcade,    a    simple cartilaginous rod), in fact, usually becomes continu
ously ossi<U+FB01>ed           with the mastoid, forming part of the walls of the
styloid canal;          while below this, and external to the tympanum,                              it   is
converted into that slender                    bone, which        is    known        as    the styloid
process.
     In adult birds        and most reptiles, the upper end                    of   the hyoid arch
is   free, but in some           Reptilia* it_is attached by styloid process to
                                                                           a
the representative            of the mastoid. Whether attached to the cranium
or not, in all abranehiate               V    ertebrata the proximal end of the hyoi
dean arch       is    quite distinct from that of the mandibular arch.
     In the Amphibia, however,                I   <U+FB01>nd   a   condition of the proximal ends
of   these two arches, which                  seems to foreshadow that intimate con
nexion between them which obtains in <U+FB01>shes.                               On the outer side of
the petrosal, and of that part of the exoccipital which represents
the mastoid, there lies            a   cartilaginous mass, which           is   continued down
wards into        a   pedicle, with whose lower end the mandible                             is    articu
lated.        From the anterior edge of the proximal half of this pedicle,
the narrow cartilaginous basis of the pterygoid passes forwards and
upwards, to become directly continuous with the palatine bone in the
frog, but to           stop     short of that point in the newt.                           Posteriorly,
close    to     its   proximal         end,    the pedicle becomes              connected           by    a
slender,      <U+FB01>brous or <U+FB01>bro-cartilaginous                  ligament with the upper ex

tremity of the cornu of the hyoid.             The hyoid and           the mandibular
arches are thus suspended to the skull by a common peduncle, which,
to avoid all theoretical suggestion,        I  will simply term          the “suspen
sorium.”
   The extent of     the ossi<U+FB01>cation which takes place, in and about this
primitively    cartilaginous   suspensorium, varies            greatly in different
genera of Amphibia.        Sometimes     its distal end remains wholly unos
si<U+FB01>ed;   sometimes,     as in the common frog,              a  small outer portion
of its lower extremity is       ossi<U+FB01>ed    and sends a process forwards, be
coming what is termed         the quadratojugal bone;               sometimes,      as in
the Triton, the distal half of the cartilage becomes more or less com
pletely ericlosed in a bony mass.
 '
   Another    ossi<U+FB01>c deposit usually takes place in the outer                half of the
proximal    end of the suspensorium, extending for                  a   greater   or less
distance down towards the distal end, which it may even completely
reach.    It   may be a simple        triangular      plate,    as    in Triton, or     a
T-shaped bone,      as in Rana.      In either   case its lower end is the nar
rower, and <U+FB01>ts into a kind of groove               in the posterior and outer
margin of the distal ossi<U+FB01>cation.
   This bone     was considered by Cuvier          to be the equivalent           of the
tympanic and the temporal (=squamosal)                 ;   by Duges it was called
“ temporomastoid.”
   The-last constituent of this region of the skull in the Amphibia is
one which     is frequently    overlooked altogether.              In the frog, the
membrana tympani is supported by              a well-de<U+FB01>ned cartilaginous and
partially ossi<U+FB01>ed hoop, which is originally quite distinct from any of
the elements of the suspensorium which have just been described,
and which clearly deprives any of them of the right of being con
sidered the homologue of the “ tympanicum

   The skulls of     <U+FB01>shes present difficulties which necessitate,              even for
my present limited purpose, the entering into greater detail regarding
them, than respecting those of the Reptilia or Amphibia.                         I select
the cranium of the carp for description,            as   it  departs far less widely
from the common plan, and therefore forms                   a better type for com

elongated bone, which,                      as   in   the bird, sends                     process           as   far    as   the

less   of   the presphenoid.                The short vomer terminates the craniofacial

same        essential relations             as   in   the bird, for the olfactory nerves pass
out    of   the skull over, and              in    front of, the orbito-sphenoids;                                the optic
nerves make their exit behind and beneath these and the alisphenoid,
while the trigeminal makes                         its   exit behind the posterior edge
                                                               the                                                      of
alisphenoid. When viewed from   within, the foramen ovale  seen                                                   is           to
 be    asthe bird, mere conjugational foramen between the alisphe
            in                  a
noid and the bome which follows                                  it;    and       on     an      external view, the
third division             of
                the trigeminal                           is      seen   to   pass entirely              in   front       of  the
last-named bone.
    The minutest scrutiny                   of    the relations           of   this bone only strengthens
                                                 by
                                                                                       of it,
the conviction suggested     the first view                                       of            that   it   is   the    homo
logue    theofpetrosal   birds,         of
                                and therefore                                                   mammals and                  rep
 tiles.      As       in   the bird, the anterior margin                           of     the fish's petrosal                  is

                                                             405
divided           into a superior and                      an    inferior portion, which meet at an
angle,           the    superior            portion   with the parietal (and
                                                            articulating
squamosal),               the inferior with the alisphenoid.   Inferiorly, the
petrous articulates with the basisphenoid,                                       and, to a small                      extent,
with the basioccipital. Posteriorly it articulates with a bone
through which the pneumogastric passes, and which, guided by
the analogy of most Reptilia,                               of Amphibia, and of birds,                           I believe
to represent the coalesced or connate mastoid and exoccipital.   The
bone lodges the anterior part of the auditory labyrinth;       middle                                           its
region corresponds with the middle                                    of   the mesencephalon.                      But       as
        does not separate the auditory organ from the cavity                                               of   the skull,
it it   naturally presents                  no   foramina corresponding with those through
 which the portio dura and portio mollis pass                                                                         Verte
                                                                                       of in

 brata and Amphibia.  There                                 is   one relation                  the petrosal            in   the
 fish, however, which  seems in              it                 to   differ from that               of   any   of   the   ovi
 parous Vertebrata                        hitherto described.                Superiorly             and posteriorly,
 in      fact,    it    does not unite with the supraoccipital,                                      which       is    small,
 comparatively                insignificant, and occupies the middle                                 of   the posterior
 and superior region                      of    the   skull; but with            a   large and distinct bone
 which forms the internal                              of
                                  the two posterolateral angles    the                                                 of
 skull, unites internally with the supraoccipital, anteriorly with the
 parietal and petrosal, inferiorly with the conjoined mastoid and ex
 occipital.            It            the bone which was called “occipital externe” by
                             he is
 Cuvier; and                     and others have supposed                     it   to          be   the homologue            of
 that bone              in    the turtle which, following                        Hallmann,           I     have endea
 voured           to   prove         to    be   the mastoid.            As  I     have already shown, the
 true mastoid             of      the fish must             be   sought elsewhere, and consequently
 the Cuvierian                determination                is   inadmissible. And     must confess, I
 that      if     our comparisons                     be   confined     to adult Vertebrata, the only
 conclusion which                     can       be   arrived      at   seems    be, that this bone
                                                                                  to                                         is
 peculiar          to   fishes.
        But   a    remarkable               and interesting                observation              of   Rathke,        com
 bined with the peculiar structure                               of    the skull        of     the chick described
 above, leads me                 to   believe that when their development                                is   fully worked
 out,        we
              shall find    distinct representative
                                      a                                              of    this bone            in     many,
if      not all, vertebrate crania.
        In   his account               of   the development                 of   Coluber natrix (see Note
 IV.),        Rathke           states that three centres                      of     ossification make their

appearance in that part of the cartilaginous                                     wall of the cranium
which immediately surrounds the auditory labyrinth. One of these
is anterior, and becomes the petrosal; one is posterior, and even
tually unites with the exoccipital; the third is superior, and in the
end coalesces              with the supraoccipital.                     The posterior ossification
clearly represents the mastoid, and                           it is most interesting to find                       it,
        this early condition,

   The superior ossification has only   increase    size and remain                in

           the same    way    the mastoid     the turtle remains di

stinct,       to   occupy the precise position                the “occipital externe”

the fish.           But, further,       it    is   most important    remark, that when

the mastoid and                to    the semicircular           canals,       in   the snake,            as    that
lateral element, early confluent    connate with the supraoccipital
                                                        or
in the chick, which    have termed the “os epioticum.”
                                   I                       believe,                                  I
then, that this               “os epioticum,”           distinct        in    the young snake, but
afterwards confluent with the supraoccipital, and becoming what may
of be
        termed the epiotic ala               of   that bone    in     the adult,       is      the homologue
    the corresponding bone,     confluent ala  orthe supraoccipital,        of                                     in
birds and reptiles, while  the fish   remains distinct, and constitutes
                                        in              it

 In     adopting the universally known Cuvierian appellations,                          I      merely desire       to

cornu of the hyoid arch           is attached;       anteriorly    and distally   it
ends in an expanded plate, with which two bones are connected, in
front the tympanal, behind the symplectique. The distal end of
the suspensor is constituted by the triangular jugal, whose distal and
narrower     extremity furnishes     the condyle with which the mandible
is articulated.

    The elongated styliform symplectique is received into a groove on
the posterior part of the inner surface of the jugal, and extends
nearly to the condyle. In front, the jugal articulates with the trans
verse,   and more or less with the pterygoidien,                which again     are
anteriorly    connected with the palatine.          The flat tympanal is fitted
in between the pterygoidien, jugal, and temporal.
    Besides these numerous bones, there are four others which enter
less directly into the composition of the suspensorium.                 These are
the pre-opercule, a sort      of splint-like bone which lies on the outer
and posterior faces     of the temporal and jugal, and binds the two
together; the opercule, which articulates with                 a special  condyle
developed for it from the posterior            edge    of the temporal, above
the attachment of the hyoid; the sousopercule, which lies in the
opercular membrane beneath          this; and lastly, the interopercule, the
lowest   of all, and commonly more or         less closely connected with the
 angle of the lower jaw.

    On examining the region in which                 these   bones   are eventually
found, in an embryonic <U+FB01>sh,            I  discovered, in their place,       a  delicate
inverted cartilaginous       arch, attached anteriorly, by a very slender
pedicle, to the angles of the ethmoidal cartilage, and posteriorly con
 nected   by  a  much thicker crus with the anterior portion of that
part of the cranial wall which encloses the auditory organ (<U+FB01>g. 8).
    The crown of the inverted arch exhibits an articular condyle for
the cartilaginous rudiment of the mandible.                  The posterior crus is
not,  as  it appears at <U+FB01>rst, a single continuous mass, but is composed
of two perfectly distinct     pieces     of cartilage applied together by their
edges.      The anterior of    these juxtaposed pieces is continuous below
with the condyle-bearing crown of the arch, and with its anterior
crus or pedicle    (P.Q.).     It  is inclined backwards and upwards, and
terminates    close to the base     of the skull in      a free pointed extremity.
    The posterior   piece   (S.Y. H.M.),       on the other hand, has its broad
and narrow ends turned in the opposite direction.                Distally, or below,
it is a slender cylindrical rod terminating in a rounded free extremity
behind, but close to, the condyle for the mandible             ; above, it gradually
widens and becomes connected with the cranial walls.                On its posterior
edge there is a convexity which              articulates with the rudimentary
operculum, and      below this it gives off          a  short styloid process,       to
which the cartilaginous cornu of the hyoid is articulated.                       Thus
the cartilaginous arch, which stretches            from the auditory capsule         to
the ethmo-presphenoidal cartilage, consists, in reality, of two perfectly
distinct and separate portions—-the anterior division V-shaped, having
its anterior crus <U+FB01>xed and its posterior crus free above; the posterior,
styliform, parallel with the posterior leg of the V and free below.
The anterior division supports the mandibular cartilage, the pos
terior the hyoidean cornu.
    As ossi<U+FB01>cation    takes   place, that part       of  the anterior crus      of the
V-shaped cartilage which is attached to the ethmo-presphenoidal car
tilage becomes the palatine        ;   its angle becomes the       jugal  ;   between
these two the transverse and pterygoidien                (represented   by only one
bone    in Gasterosteus)      are developed        in and around the anterior
crus: the tympanal       arises   in the     same way around the free end of
the   posterior crus.      Thus      these    bones    constitute an assemblage
which is at <U+FB01>rst quite distinct from the other elements                  of the    sus
pensorium, and immediately supports the mandibular cartilage.

   The proximal end (H.M.) of the posterior styliform division gradu
ally becomes articulated with the cranial walls, and, ossifying, is con
verted into the temporal.                    The distal cylindrical end (S.Y.)                         becomes
surrounded        by        an osseous sheath,              which at first          leaves      its   distal end
unenclosed.            The bone thus formed                    is   the symplectique, which                 is   at
first free, but eventually               becomes          enclosed within                   sheath furnished

the temporal.               The symplectique and temporal                         do   not meet, but leave
between them               a   cartilaginous space, whence the supporting pedicle
of the hyoid, which ossifies and becomes the osselet styloide, arises.

  If    we turn       to the higher     Vertebrata, we <U+FB01>nd, as                I   have      stated
above, that, at an early period         of their embryonic              existence,       they also
present a cartilaginous arch, stretching from the ethmo-presphenoidal
cartilage to the auditory capsule, and supporting                       the mandibular            or
Meckelian cartilage on the condyle furnished by its inverted crown.
The anterior part of         the anterior crus         of this arch      becomes the pala
tine bone, which is therefore truly the homologue of the <U+FB01>shes’ pala
tine.       The posterior part of it    becomes the pterygoid, which therefore
is the homologue of the pterygoiulien (and transverse?) of the <U+FB01>sh.
   The produced crown of the arch in the higher Vertebrata becomes
either the incus, or its equivalent, the quadratum.                                 I    therefore
entertain no doubt that the jugal is really the homologue of the
quadratum          of other oviparous Vertebrata.                     That    the       tympanal
has no       relation whatsoever with the bone of                 the    same name in the
higher       Vertebrata is indubitable;       and      I am     unable to discover among
them any representative of it.              It   seems to me to be an essentially
piscine       bone,    to be regarded       either     as   a    dismemberment of the
quadratum or of the            pterygoid.         It    may be termed the “meta
pterygoid.”
   Still     less do   I   <U+FB01>nd among the higher               Vertebrata in their adult
state, any representative        of the posterior division of                 the       suspensor,
constituted by the temporal and symplectique.                            It   is quite clear,
that the        temporal     is not,   as   Cuvier’s        name      would indicate, the
homologue of the squamosal.                 The whole         course    of its    development
would negative such an idea, even             if we had         not a squamosal already;
and     I    shall therefore henceforward              term     it,   from its function of
affording support to both the hyoid and mandibular arches, the hyo
mandibular bone,   “os hyomandibulare,” while the other                                   bone    of
this division may well retain the name of symplectic.
   It   is    commonly supposed that the hyomandibular,                             symplectic,
metapterygoid, and quadrate are all                    to be regarded as mere sub
divisions of the quadratum of higher              Vertebrata.            Such a view, how
ever, completely ignores and fails to explain, the connexion                                of   the
hyoidean arch with the hyomandibular                        bone.       In no       one    of    the
higher Vertebrata           does such   a    connexion ever obtain between                       any
part of the           quadratum and the hyoid,                which      are quite distinct,
and attached separately          to the walls       of the cranium, in              even young
embryos of the abranchiate Vertebrata.

                                                     4-ll
  Nevertheless, in their very earliest conditions, these embryos are
said to present a structure, which,                    if I   mistake not, shadows forth the
organization of the <U+FB01>sh.                      The visceral       arches,    in which the man
dibular and hyoid cartilages are developed,                          are at <U+FB01>rst separated            to
the very base of the cranium by a deep cleft, the anterior visceral
cleft, so that the semi-cartilaginous                          rudiments of the mandibular
and hyoid are completely separate.                            Subsequently they are said to
coalesce above, as the visceral cleft diminishes, so as to                            havea        com
mon root of attachment to the cranium; and this,                                  I   apprehend,
answers       to the hyomandibular                 and its prolongation to the
                                                      bone,
symplectic.         With         advancing development, however, this part does
not advance, but remains stationary, and becomes                               confounded with
the wall of the cranium               ;   so that the two arches subsequently appear
to be attached to the latter quite independently, and there is nothing
left to represent this division of the suspensorium in <U+FB01>shes.
     I   am   strengthened in this view by the structure and develop
ment of the palatosuspensorial                        apparatus in the 4mphibia,              whose
consideration        I       deferred when speaking of the skull in that class.
On examining             a   young tadpole (<U+FB01>g. 9), a cartilaginous process is seen
to arise from the walls of the cranium, opposite the anterior part of
the auditory capsule, and, passing obliquely downwards and forwards,                                        ,
to end  ina rounded condyloid head, which articulates with the repre
sentative of Meckel’s cartilage.   At the anterior boundary of the
orbit the process gives off               a   broad, nearly vertical apophysis (O), which
ends superiorly in a free, rounded, and incurved edge.                                 The crota
phite muscle passes to its insertion on the inner side of this, the
so-called “orbitar process.”                         From     the condyle      the cartilaginous
process       sweeps upwards and inwards, and ends by passing into the
ethmo-presphenoidal                cartilage.          It     consequently forms an inverted
arch, whose keystone is the condyle for Meckel’s cartilage, and                              is,   in its
connexions and form, strictly comparable with the cartilaginous arch
which    I    have described in the embryo <U+FB01>sh.                            The posterior crus of
the arch,      it   is   true,   is   not divided into two parts, but nevertheless
it   represents the whole suspensorium of the <U+FB01>sh, and not merely
the quadratum of the abranehiate vertebrate,                               because immediately
behind the orbitar process                      it   presents an excavated        surface,     which
articulates with the proximal end                       of the cornu of the hyoid.                 That
part of the cartilaginous arch, therefore, which lies above and behind

                                                                        412
this point, corresponds with the proximal division of the suspensorium
in the fish, or with the hyomandibular bone; while that portion which
                                                           it,

the suspensorium and the anterior crus                                                  of   the arch          in   the fish,
in     other       words, with the symplectic,                                         quadratum,              metapterygoid,
pterygoid, transverse, and palatine bones.
     in In
             the course           of      development,                    in   fact, the palatine bone appears,
as           the fish,           in      that part              of   the arch which                  is   immediately              con
nected with the ethmo-presphenoidal cartilage, and                                                        a   single pterygoid
in   that part          of       its     anterior crus which lies between the palatine and
the articular portion,                           which obviously                        represents the quadratum.
But this pterygoid                        is,   in    the adult frog,                  a   large bone, which,                  on   the
one hand, stretches down                                   on    the inner side             of   the quadrate cartilage,
and,         on    the other, sends                        a       process inwards                and upwards,                which
nearly reaches the base                               of    the skull.            If       the pterygoid, transverse,
and metapterygoid                         of    the fish were anchylosed into one bone,                                            orif
the corresponding region                               of    the primitive cartilage were continuously
ossified, the result would                                         bone perfectly similar                          the pterygoid

does really represent these bones.
     The inferior ossification                                     the batrachian suspensorium                              certainly

  That this bone is really the homologue of the hyomandibular and
symplectic in the fish, becomes,                          I
                                   think, still more clear when we
compare   it with such an aberrant form of piscine suspensorium as
is presented by some of the eel-tribe (Muraena, e.g.). In these fishes
the suspensorium is formed by only two bones, a small distal quadra
tum, which, as usual, articulates with the lower jaw, and a large wide
proximal           bone,       which articulates              above with the post-frontal          and
squamosal, gives attachment to the operculum and to the cornu of the
hyoid,          and sends down a process towards the articular                            head of the
quadratum.    The single bone, which represents the three pterygoids
of other fishes, is articulated for the most part with the quadratum,
but partly with this proximal bone. The latter, therefore, clearly
represents both                 the   hyomandibular              and the symplectic          bones   of
ordinary fishes.
  But if the suspensorium of Triton be compared with that of
Muraena, e. g., it will, I think, be hardly doubted, that while the
distal ossification                in the former corresponds with the quadratum,
the proximal              answers (at any rate, chiefly)                   to the hyomandibular
bone of the Muraena.                    Indeed      it differs from the latter principally in
being an ossific deposit in the outer portion                                 only of the primitive
cartilage".
     Thus it would          in the manner in which the lower jaw is
                                  seem, that
connected with the cranium, Pisces and Amphibia, as in so many other
particulars, agree with one another, and differ from Reptilia and
Aves on the one hand, as much as they do from Mammalia on the
other.           And the difference consists mainly,                     as might be anticipated,
in the large development in the branchiate Vertebrata of a structure
which aborts in the abranchiate                          classes.   A most      interesting series   of
modifications,              all   tending   to   approximate the ramus             of   the mandible
more closely              to   the skullt,     is   observable      as   we pass from the fish       to
the mammal.                    In   the first, the two are separated                by   the hyoman
dibular, the quadrate, and the articular                            elements, the first      of   which

Verlebrata        the cranium and            the ramus are separated              only by the
quadratum         and the articulare,             the hyomandibulare            having disap
peared.      Finally, in       the mammal, the quadratum and the articulare
are applied to new functions, and the ramus comes into direct contact
with the cranium.
  The operculum, suboperculum, and interoperculum                                appear to me
to be specially piscine structures, having no unquestionable repre
sentatives       in the higher Vertebrata.                Much might          be said in favour
of the identi<U+FB01>cation of the preoperculum with the tympanic bone;
but there are many arguments on the other side, and at present                                    I
do not     see   my way to the formation of                   a    de<U+FB01>nite conclusion on this
subject.
   In the preceding discussion of                      the structure     of   the osseous      ver
tebrate skull,         I   have     desired to direct your attention, more parti
cularly, to the consideration of those fundamental bones, the deter
mination         of   whose   homologues throughout                   the vertebrate     series is
of the    greatest importance for my present object.                  The presphenoid,
ethmoid, mastoid, and petrosal are                      the Malakhoff and the Redan of
the theory of the skull;               and   if   anatomists were once agreed about
their homologues, there would be comparatively little left to dispute
about.
   But     besides the axial, inferolateral, and superior                      series   of   bones,
there are other, less constant, elements of the cranial wall, forming                                a
discontinuous superolateral series.                      These are the epiotic, the squa
mosal, the postfrontal, the prefrontal, and lacrymal bones.                                  Of the
two <U+FB01>rst-named of these bones                      I   have       already spoken su<U+FB02>iciently.
 The postfrontal           exists    only in Reptiles and Fishes, and is always
 situated between the frontal, alisphenoid, petrosal, and squamosal—
 the extent to which it is absolutely in contact with any one of these
 bones varying.
    The prefrontal and lacrymal bones are always developed in or
 upon that lateral process of the ethmosphenoidal plate, which gives
 attachment externally to the palatopterygoid arch; consequently they
 lie at the anterolateral ends of the frontal, and have more or less
 close relations with         it,   the ethmoid and the palatine bones.
    Finally,      the nasal bones (or bone) never enter into the composition
                                                                                  2r2

or body of the ethmoid, as the vomer or vomers have to its lower
edge.
      If   the conclusions which           I    have laid before you are correct, the
following propositions are true of all the bony skulls of Vertebrate.
      1.   Their axis contains            at    most <U+FB01>ve        distinct    bones, which are,
from before backwards, the basioccipital, the basisphenoid,                             the pre
sphenoid, the ethmoid,                 and the vomer;               but any of these        bones,
except the basisphenoid, may be represented by cartilage, and they
may anchylose to an inde<U+FB01>nite extent; so that the number distin
guishable as separate bones in any skull cannot be predicated.                                 The
craniofacial         axis    invariably        presents       the    same   regions,    but     the
histological character of these regions may vary.
      2. Their roof contains at most, leaving Wormian bones out of con
sideration, <U+FB01>ve bones (supraoccipital,                  parietals and frontals), or seven,
if we      include the epiotic bones in the roof.                    The number falls below
this in particular           cases,   for the     same     reason      as that   given for the
apparent variations in composition of the axis.
   3. Their inferolateral              wall     contains       at    most six pair     of    bones
(exoccipitals, mastoids, petrosals, alisphenoids, orbitosphenoids,                            pre
frontals),       whose apparent number, however, is affected by the same
causes.
   4. The axial bones have de<U+FB01>nite relations to the brain and nerves.
The basioccipital lies behind the pituitary body, the basisphenoid
beneath        it,
            the presphenoid in front of it.   In fact the pituitary
body may be regarded as marking the organic centre, as     were, of                it
the skull—its relations to the axial cranial bones being the same, as
far   as
       I       am aware,     in all   Vertebrata.
  The olfactory             nerves    pass on either side of the ethmoid, which
bounds the cranial cavity in front, the greater part of its substance
and that of the vomer being outside the cranial cavity.
  5. The lateral bones have de<U+FB01>nite relations to the brain, nerves,
and organs of sense.         The exoccipital lies behind the exit of the par
vagum      ;   the mastoid lies in front of     the petrosal lies behind the
                                                     it   ;
exit of the third division of the trigeminal; the alisphenoid                               lies in
front of       it;   though either bone may, to               a     certain slight extent, eu

                                                             4.17
croach on the province                            of the other.               The optic nerve                 passes out
more or less in front                       of the alisphenoid, and behind, or through, the
orbitosphenoid.
     The organ of hearing is always bounded in front by the petrosal
bone, which limits the anterior moiety                                      of the fenestra ovalis.
     The organs of smell always                             lie   on   each side          of   the ethmovomerine
part         ofthe axis.
     The greater part,                      or   the whole,           of    the petrosal lies behind the
centre         of   the mesencephalon.
        6.   The attachment of the mandibular arch                                        to   the skull        is   never
situated further forward than the posterior boundary                                                    of   the exit      of
the trigeminal; consequently                            it   cannot belong                to   any segment           of   the
skull         in   front     of      the petrosal.
     But      if   propositions             of   this generality can              be   enunciated with regard
        all   bony vertebrate skulls,
of to
                                                       itis   needless        to     seek for       further evidence
   their unity   plan. These propositions are the expression
                             of                               that                                               of
plan, and might,     one   pleased,  ifthrown intoso  diagrammatic     be                           a
form. There                           no   harm    in   calling such                 convenient diagram the
‘Archetype                   of is   the skull, but     I         prefer
                                                                              to a

notation           is   so   fundamentally             opposed         to   the spirit         of   modern science.
     Admitting, however, that                           a    general unity                of   plan pervades the
organization               of     the ossified skull, the important                             fact remains, that
many vertebrated animals—all those fishes,                                           in   fact, which are known
as      Elasmobranchii,                    Marsipobranchii, Pharyngobranchii, and Dipnoi
—have              no
           bony skull   all,    least        at
                                        the sense  which the words
                                                        at             in                      in
have hitherto been used.     In these Vertebrata the skull   either                                            is
membranous                   or      cartilaginous;          or   if   ossified, the ossific matter                   pre
sents         no   regular grouping around                        a   few distinct centres.
   Thus the cranium                        of   the Amphioxus           is   nothing but             a   membranous
capsule, whose walls are continuous with those                                             of   the canal for the
spinal cord, and                     in   whose floor lies         a   continuation             of      the notochord
which underlies the spinal canal.
   Inthe Marsipobranchii there                               is   a    marked increase               in     the capacity
of   the cranium                     as   compared with that                 of   the spinal canal,              in      cor
respondence with the decided differentiation    the cerebral masses;                 of
and,   the same time, the cranial walls have undergone more
         at                                                     less                                                or
                                                                                                     in a
extensive chondrification.                         The notochord terminates                               the midst       of
the firm and solid cartilaginous plate which forms the posterior part

                                        418
of the basis cranii, and which       sends forward two processes,       including
a membranous interspace.          The auditory capsules are enclosed within
prolongations of the sides of the basilar plate; and just in front of
and below them, the root of each process of the basal plate gives off
a solid prolongation,      which passes at <U+FB01>rst outwards and downwards,
and then bends iipwards and forwards, to rejoin the anterior part of
the process of the basilar plate of its side.         An inverted arch is thus
formed, and the space included between              its crura and the sides     of
the cranium, constitutes the <U+FB02>oor of the orbit.
    The posterior crus of the arch is divided into two, more or less
distinct, pillars, the posterior of which supports the hyoidean arc;
the mandibular arc appears to be absent.
    The apertures whereby the cranial nerves make their exit are
situated in the side-walls of the capsule, that for the vagus lying
immediately behind the auditory capsule, while that for the trigeminal
is immediately in front of the same organ.            The olfactory   nerves per
 forate the anterior walls of the cranial capsule        ;  the optic, its lateral
walls between them and the trigeminal.
    The skulls of the Elasmobranchii,       again, appear at <U+FB01>rst to be some
 thing quite different from either of        these.     The cranium is here      a
 cartilaginous   box, more or less incomplete and membranous above,
 and presenting on each side posteriorly a transverse enlargement, in
 which the auditory organ is contained;           while anteriorly it expands
 into a broad plate, which on each side overhangs the olfactory sacs.
 The notochord       and the membranous         space    have disappeared,      or
 their traces only are       visible   in the base of the cranium,          whose
 walls are, as it were,      crusted with a multitude of minute plates of
 bone.
     In the  C/timaene    the inferolateral walls of the cranium pass into
 a cartilaginous arch-like     plate which form the <U+FB02>oor of the orbit, and
 whose posterior part, as in the Marsipobranchii, gives attachment to
 the hyoidean arch     ; besides which, a mandibular       cartilage is connected
 with the condyloid surface developed from the crown of the arched
 plate.
     In the Plagiostomes there is also      an inverted suborbitar       arch with
 a mandibular     cartilage and a hyoidean apparatus, but the structure
  of the arch is different from what obtains in Ckimeera.
     The outer wall of that portion-of the cranium which lodges                the

                                          419
auditory organ, in fact, furnishes           an articular     surface  for a strong
moveable peduncle, to which the hyoid arc is usually attached.                   At its
lower end, however, this peduncle does not articulate with the man
dibular cartilage, but is directly connected with             a  strong cartilaginous
plate which forms the upper boundary of the gape, and is articulated
anteriorly with the sides of the skull in front of the orbit. This plate
bears the upper series        of teeth, and bites more or less directly against
the mandible, which is moveably articulated with                 a condyle furnished
by its posterior extremity.
    The upper plate is commonly, though, as I think, erroneously,
regarded as the homologue of the maxilla and premaxilla in other
<U+FB01>shes    ;  the peduncle as the homologue of their whole suspensorium*.
    The par vagum         leaves the    skull behind the auditory organ ; the
trigeminal       passes  out in front of it; and then its third division tra
verses     the space enclosed        between    the peduncle, the upper plate,
 and the skull.        The optic nerve passes through the lateral walls of
 the skull in front of the trigeminal, and the olfactory perforates its
 anterior boundary.
    So brief and simple a statement of the characters of the skulls of
 these three orders       of <U+FB01>shes, while it brings their diversities into pro
 minence, also      exhibits an amount of uniformity among them which
 is not   a  little remarkable.       The exits of the great       nerves have    <U+FB01>xed
 relations to the auditory capsules,           to the anterior boundary of the
 skull, and to the pituitary body.             The inferior     arc  of the hyoid is
 constant (except in the Pharynyobranchii), and has always, speaking
 broadly, the same relative position with respect               to the auditory cap
 sule and the posterior crus          of the suborbitar arch.         The suborbitar
 arch itself is always present (except in Pharyngobrarwhii)                 _; its pos
 terior crus is always attached to the cranium behind the third division
 of the trigeminal nerve, while the anterior is invariably <U+FB01>xed to that
 part of the skull which lies behind, or beside, the base of the olfactory
 capsule.
     Thus the employment of the method of gradation alone exhibits
 a  surprising uniformity in the organization of these lower forms of
 skull  ;  and on comparing them with the higher forms, it seems obvious
 that, so far as it goes, their plan is identical with that of the latter;
  for the relations of the auditory organ to the par vagum and trige
                    * See   Note IV., on the suspensoriur-n in <U+FB01>shes.

 minal are the same in each; the posterior crus of the suborbitar
 arch answers to the suspensorium of Teleostei,                                          its   anterior crus        to
 their palatopterygoid                   apparatus.            But with            all   this, there are          dis
 crepancies         in   the structure          of   the skull itself, which would forbid too
 close       an   approximation between the bony and the unossified crania,                                         if
 their adult forms alone were examined. The study     the development                    of
 of the ossified vertebrate skull, however, eliminates this difficulty,
 and satisfactorily proves that the adult crania                                of     the lower Vertebrata
 are but special developments                        of      conditions through which the em
 bryonic crania           of
                  the highest members                               of  the subkingdom pass.
     It   is   to
           Rathke’s luminous researches                               that we are indebted for the
 first, and indeed, even now, almost the only, demonstrative evidence
 of     this great fact.            Twenty years ago that great and laborious em
 bryologist worked out the early stages                                of      the development               of   the
 skull       in
         each class                of
                       the Vertebrata.    Confirmed                                         and adopted by
 Vogt and Bischoff, his conclusions have been feebly controverted, but
 never confuted; and my own observations lead me          believe that                          to
 they are destined                 to   take    a    permanent place among the data                                 of
 biological science.                Nothing                                        verify Rathke's views
                                                                               it to
                                                 is    easier than
 in     an   embryonic fish             or   amphibian; and                as          matters not which            of
 the higher Vertebrata                   is   selected        for the study              of    cranial develop
 ment,   will state
         I                        at   some length what            I      have observed               in   the   em
 bryonic frog.*
      Before the dorsal laminae have united                           so   as    to    enclose the primitive
craniospinal          cavity, the anterior portion      that cavity       of    the floor       of
isbent downwards.   The angle which the deflexed portion forms
with the rest becomes less and less obtuse, until, when the dorsal
laminae have united and the visceral clefts have begun                                               to   appear,   it
 constitutes        a    right angle.

             that the notochord,                         present formed                  by    the aggregation

but larger than those   which the rest   the body

in   point immediately behind the angular flexure.

     The notochord has                  no    sheath     as   yet, and      is     not    in    any sense        pro

inner or pharyngeal aspect of the visceral wall.                         Five, of which the
two anterior         are    the longest and about equal,                  while    the. others
gradually diminish in length from before backwards, can be distinctly
observed.         They mark out the boundaries of              a   corresponding number
of “visceral arches,” and there is                 sometimes       an appearance            as   of   a
sixth visceral arch behind the last cleft.                   A horizontal       section      shows
that these arches differ in nothing but their relative size-—in no other
respect        can one    of them    be distinguished from the other.
     The anterior visceral cleft lies in a transverse                    plane, immediately
behind the angular bend of the <U+FB02>oor of the craniospinal cavity, or,
as   I shall    henceforward term         it,   mesocephalic <U+FB02>exure.            Consequently
the posterior part of the <U+FB01>rst visceral arch passes into the future
basis cranii close to the <U+FB02>exure.
     The parts of the cerebrum            are now distinguishable.                It   is   bent in
correspondence with the mesocephalic <U+FB02>exure, and its most pro
jecting portion, or the angle of the bend,    the rudiment of the
                                                                is
mesencephalon. The large rudiment of the pituitary body lies im
mediately in front of the <U+FB02>exure, and therefore altogether anterior
                                                        is
to the end of the notochord                 and to the posterior part of the <U+FB01>rst
visceral arch.            The rudiment of the            eye lies at <U+FB01>rst altogether                  in
front     of    the <U+FB02>exnre, and therefore anterior to the root of the <U+FB01>rst
visceral arch.
     The auditory         vesicles   make       their appearance         on each       side      of   a
line which would cut the chorda                   a    little behind its anterior termi
nation.         They     are at <U+FB01>rst quite free and perfectly distinct from the
walls of the cranium, which                 is   in accordance       with Remak’s state
ment, that they are originally formed by the involution of the epi
dermic layer of the embryo.                 They long remain             separate and easily
detachable from the cranial walls.
     Ten   days after impregnation, larvae with rudimentary external gills
and colourless blood, still exhibited some traces of the mesocephalic
<U+FB01>exure, but the angle formed by the anterior and posterior portions
of the cranium            was very obtuse;         the base of the cranium had, in
fact, undergone           a   gradual     straightening.        The rudiments of the
cranial        skeleton had made their appearance,                 and    consisted,        behind
the mesocephalic angle, of            a   broad semi-cartilaginous plate enclosing
the anterior end of the notochord, but not covering                      it   above or below.
It   is   not as yet adherent to the auditory sacs.

                                         422
    That part of      the  middle of the basis cranii which underlies the
pituitary     body is not converted into cartilage, but remains             mem
branous, and may be called the “subpituitary membrane.”                      The
delicacy of this membrane           is  so  great that it is easily torn, when
the pituitary body seems,         as   Rathke    originally supposed,   to unite
with the palatine mucous membrane.                 But that this is not really
the case, is readily demonstrable in an embryo whose tissues have
been sn<U+FB01>iciently hardened with alcohol or nitric acid.
    The cartilaginous basal plate gives o<U+FB01> a prolongation on either
side of the subpituitary membrane.              This, the “ cranial trabecula”
(Schiidelbalke of Rathke), passes forwards with a slight convexity
outwards, and then turning inwards comes into contact with its
fellow (from which, however, it is at <U+FB01>rst distinct),~and spreads out
into a broad, <U+FB02>at, elongated process, which I shall term the ethmo
vomerine cartilage.
     Behind the eye and just in front of the auditory capsule             (in the
posterior part of the <U+FB01>rst visceral arch, therefore), a cartilaginous
process lies, which is connected          proximally with the root of the tra
becula close to the basal         plate,   while at its distal end it sends     a
prolongation       upwards to unite with the posterior end of the ethmo
vomerine cartilage.        It  then forms an arch, between which and the
basis cranii is an interspace     corresponding with, and lodging, the under
 surface    of  the large eyeball.       The rudiments of the hyoid, mandi
 bular and maxillary apparatus in larvae at this stage are somewhat
indistinct    ;  and indeed not only in this, but in other respects, more in
 struction is to be derived from tadpoles which have advanced further.
     In  larvae, with    completely internal hranchiae      and very short tu
 bercles   in   the place  of hind limbs,     the notochord   suddenly narrows
between      the auditory capsules     to hardly more than    half its preceding
 dimensions, and then gradually tapers            off, to what appears    to be a
 rounded end,       a  short distance from the anterior boundary of the
 basal   plate.     On very careful examination, however,        a delicate  pro
 cess   (which may by possibility be nothing but a cavity in the car
 tilage) can be traced from it very nearly to the margin of the basal
plate. But there is no continuation whatsoever, either of the noto
 chord itself or of its sheath, into the subpituitary membrane,             which
 is now composed        of delicate   connective tissue, and from its extreme
 thinness and transparency would exhibit the least trace of such                 a

                                         423
prolongation.       And   I speak the more con<U+FB01>dently on            this point, be
cause the delicate process       of the notochord or cavity in the cartilage,
to which     I have   referred, contains opaque unchanged vitelline gra
nules, and is therefore particularly conspicuous.             The   basal cartilage
is still divided by the notochord into two lateral moieties,             which are
only united by a short band of cartilage in front of the end of the
notochord.       It sends off from its outer side a cartilaginous process,
which     envelopes    the auditory capsule      externally, but leaves on its
inner    side a wide aperture for       the entrance of the auditory nerve.
The   oval auditory capsules thus formed have their long axes directed
outwards and forwards.
   The    trabeculae are    still better developed than      before,   but instead
of remaining distinct anteriorly, they        have become fused together into
a single trapezoidal cartilage, which may be termed the ethmo-pre
sphenoidal plate.        This plate,   as it were, divides anteriorly into two
flat, elongated and somewhat          divergent processes, which are concave
downwards and end in truncate extremities.              Fibrous tissue connects
the ends of these ethmovomerine processes              with a crescentic      carti
laginous plate which supports the horny upper jaw of the tadpole.
   The posterior crus of the palatosuspensorial, or suborbitar, arch is
not yet united with that portion of the cranial wall which encloses
the auditory capsule;        but fort he rest the same description applies
to it which has already been given of the palatosuspensorial arch and
its appendages      in, more advanced       tadpoles.     In this  state, the roof,
and all the lateral walls of the cranium, but that part into which the
auditory capsule enters, are membranous.
   If the    skull of the larval frog just     described,   be laid open and the
exit of the nerves       observed     (<U+FB01>g. 9), it will     be seen that the par
vagum makes its way out by a foramen situated immediately behind
the auditory capsule; that the third division of the trigeminal leaves
the cranium in front of the auditory capsule,              passing over the pos
terior crus of the palatosuspensorial arch; and that the optic tra
verses    the membranous walls of the skull between                  this and   the
olfactory nerve,      which perforates the anterolateral region to enter
the olfactory -capsules.        The latter    are situated wide apart, on each
side  and in front of, the broad ethmo-presphenoidal                 cartilage and
the anterior crus of the palatosuspensorial arch, and are even a little
overlapped by the edges of the ethmovomerine processes.

                                                            424
     In the further course of development, the                                     trabeculae       approximate
and elongate, so as to obliterate                                the subpituitary            membrane, and
form with the enlarged basal cartilage, the ethmoid cartilage and the
ethmovomerine                 cartilages, the continuous                      cartilaginous          craniofacial
axis.      A    histological            metamorphosis into cartilage is undergone by
the roofof the occipital region of the skull, but in front of this it
remains membranous; so that in the adult frog (in which this car
tilaginous framework persists), the skull, when deprived                                             of    its   bony
matter, presents              an   anterior fontanelle. The ethmovomerine cartilages
diverge still more, and form the broad mass whose lateral cavities
shelter the olfactory sacs                    in   the adult frog.                If,   bearing      in   mind the
changes which are undergone                                 by   the palatosuspensorial apparatus,
and which have already been described, we now compare the stages
of   development              of     the frog's skull with the persistent conditions                               of
the skull        in     the Amphioxus, the Lamprey, and the Shark, we shall
discover the model and type                            of   the latter       in   the former.          The skull
of   the Amphioxus                   presents      a     modification             of    that plan which            is
exhibited        by     the frog's skull, when                        its   walls are still membranous
and the notochord                  is   not       as   yet imbedded           in    cartilage.        The skull
of   the lamprey          is     readily reducible               to   the same plan             of   structure     as
that which           is    exhibited              by    the tadpole, while                its gills are still
external and              its   blood colourless.                  And finally, the skull                   of    the
shark      is   at   once       intelligible when                we have studied the cranium                       in
further      advanced larvae,                or   its   cartilaginous basis             in   the adult frog.
   Thus,   I     conceive,            the study         of    the mode            in    which       the skulls     of
vertebrate animals are developed, demonstrates the great truth which
is   foreshadowed               by a    careful and comprehensive examination                               of    the
gradations       of     form which they present                        in    their adult state;            namely,
that they are           all   constructed upon one plan; that they differ, indeed,
in   the extent           to    which this plan                  is    modified,         but that         all   these
modifications are foreshadowed                              in   the series        of   conditions through
which the skull               of   any one        of   the higher Vertebrata passes.
     But if     these conclusions                 be   correct, the first problem which                    I     pro
posed      to   you,-Are              all   vertebrate skulls constructed upon                        a   common
plan?—is solved affirmatively.                                                                  -

laws    of   structure          of    the skull.             All vertebrate skulls are originally
alike;     in     all   (save        Amphioxus!) the               base       of   the primitive          cranium

terminates, while immediately                        in front of      it,   the pituitary        body     is
developed;            in all, the cartilaginous cranium                   has primarily       the same
structure,—a             basal    plate enveloping the end of the notochord and
sending forth three processes,                       of which       one   is    short and median,
while the other two, the lateral trabeculae,                         pass on each         side   of the
space, on which the pituitary                       body rests, and unite in front of                  it;
in all, the mandibular                arch     is   primarily attached behind the level of
the pituitary space,                 and the auditory capsules                 are enveloped         by   a
cartilaginous            mass,    continuous with the basal plate between                         them.
The amount of further development to which the primary skull may
attain varies, and no distinct ossi<U+FB01>cations at all may take place in it;
but when such ossi<U+FB01>cation does occur, the same bones are developed
in similar relations to the primitive cartilaginous skull.   But the

     So much for the <U+FB01>rst problem before us.                          I        now proceed       to the
second question, which was, you                        will recollect, Given the       existence          of
a    common plan of organization of all vertebrate skulls;                             is     this plan
the same as that of              a   spinal column?
     To    deal    properly with this question, we must know what                                 is   the
plan of organization of               a   spinal column, and that can be learnt only
by    a   careful study of its development, as well                       as   of its adult modi<U+FB01>
cations.          Indeed, the latter are unintelligible                     without   a   knowledge
of the former.
     It   is   impossible to form          a   clear    conception of the essential nature
of the         process      of development of             a   spinal column, or to compare
it   with that of the skull, unless                     we analyse very carefully, and di
stinguish from one another, the successive steps of that process*.
      The primary changes of form exhibited by the blastoderrn in
     1.
the region of the spinal column, are, in all the V ertebrata whose
development has yet been studied, precisely the same.  Two ridges,
the “laminae              dorsales,” bounding             a    narrow elongated        groove,       rise
up and eventually unite with one another so as to enclose                                 a   cavity
the neural canal.                External      to the junction of the laminae                 dorsales

Vertebrata       generally.                                     \

with the blastoderm, the latter is converted more or less completely
into the “laminae ventrales,” which become                    incurved, unite, and
eventually enclose the visceral cavity.
    A   transverse  section   of the embryo in this       state shows a very        thin
and narrow median plate, separating the neural canal above, from the
haemal or visceral canal below, and passing on each side into                    thick
ened masses      of blastoderm, which         give  rise to the laminae        clorsales
on the one hand, and to the laminae ventrales on the other.
    For convenience of description, I shall term the median plate the
 “ diaphysial plate,” and the lateral
                                                ridges the “paraphysial thick
enings.”
    2. The primary histological           diiferentiations, which take place in
the rudimentary spinal column just described,                  are the same in all
 Vertebrata.
    A   long <U+FB01>lament, composed of indifferent tissue, makes its appear
 ance     in the middle of the         diaphysial     plate,   and constitutes the
 notochord, or chorda dorsalis.
    Next, the substance        of the paraphysial thickenings            undergoes      a
 certain change of tissue at regular intervals,            so   that they acquire a
 segmented appearance; solid, broad, darker masses of blastema lying
 opposite one another in each paraphysial thickening, and being sepa
 rated by clear, narrow interspaces.
    These segments        are what      the Germans          term   “ Urwirbel,” or
 “ primitive    vertebrae ;’
                             ’
                                a somewhat misleading name, as they are in
 every way distinct      from what are commonly understood under the
 name      of “vertebrae,”   even   if  we use that word        in its  broadest     sig
 ni<U+FB01>cation.     Professor G0odsir’s terms of Somatomes for the segments
 and Metasomatomes for their             interspaces,   appear    to me to be well
 worthy of adoption       as the   equivalents of these
                                                              “ Urwirbel.”
     3.   The next   step in the development        of  a vertebral column, is the
 histological di<U+FB01>brentiation of the somatomes.                 Leaving      out of con
 sideration the epithelial        and   other minor tissues,         it may     be   said
 that each somatome         gives   rise to (a) epiaxial muscles, (6) a nerve
 and its ganglion, (0) the blastema for a vertebral centrum and its
 neural and heemal arches, and (01) possibly hypaxial muscles ; while
 the metasomatome         becomes      for the greater part of its extent              an
  “ intermuscular
                      septum.”

the development of any of these parts, except             the   centrum and its
arches.
    The    blastema,   which is specially intended for these parts, appears,
in   a distinct    form, <U+FB01>rst, in the paraphysial       thickenings,    and then
extends inwards         above   and below, so as gradually to enclose          the
notochord in a sheath, while, externally, it passes in the posterior half
of    each somatome,       upwards into the neural arches, and downwards
into the haemal arches.
    4.   In  some Vertebrata      the spinal column never gets beyond this
stage, nor even so        far; but for the present it will    be well to con<U+FB01>ne
our attention to those which become            completely ossi<U+FB01>ed.       In  these
chondri<U+FB01>cation       is the next step.    The blastema of the centra and its
prolongations becomes converted into cartilage, but not continuously.
 On the contrary, at points corresponding with the intervals between
 every pair of metasomatomes,         or with the middle of each somatome,
 the cartilage is replaced by more or less <U+FB01>brous tissue.            As   a conse
 quence, the cartilaginous sheath        of the notochord is now divided into
 regular segments, which alternate with the somatomes,              so that each
 metasomatome        abuts upon the middle of      one   of these   cartilaginous
 vertebral centra.
     In   every   centrum it is necessary      to distinguish    three tracts or
 regions:—1.       A diaphysial region immediately surrounding the noto
 chord.       2. Two paraphysial regions lying in the paraphysial thick
 enings.      The paraphysial regions give rise to the cartilaginous neural
 and haemal semi-arcs,        which are primitively continuous with them;
 so that all parts     of the vertebra form    one connected    whole.
                                                    '
     The neural semi-arcs eventually unite in the middle line, and
 ordinarily send a prolongation upwards from their junction.                   The
 haemal semi-arcs       also  tend to unite below, but in a somewhat        di<U+FB01>'er
 ent manner.
     5.   The last    step in the development      of the vertebra is the dif
  ferentiation    of its various parts from      one another, and      their <U+FB01>nal
  metamorphosis into their adult form.           The notochord, which primi
 tively traversed the centra and the intercentra (intervertebral liga
 ments, synovial membranes, or the like, between the centra), becomes
 more or less completely obliterated.
      The distal, larger part of the        haemal   semi-arc is commonly di
  stinguished from its proximal smaller part, by the conversion of its

                                               428
 cartilage into osseous or other tissue, and thus the semi-arc becomes
 separated into a rib and an articular surface or process, for the head
 of that rib, to which last the term Parapophysis may                               be conveniently
 restricted.                                  -
     In    the dorsal vertebrae      of   many Vertebrata,                the neural semi-arc
sends out a process, the Diapophysis, which is eventually met by a
corresponding outgrowth of the rib, its so-called tubercle, and the
two become firmly connected together.
     When ossification occurs, it is            a very general,          if not invariable            rule,
that an annular deposit around the notochord                                 takes place in the
centrum.         I   term this the Diaphysis                 of the vertebra.                    In   some
fishes a distinct centre of ossification appears in each paraphysial
region, and this may be termed the Paraphysis of the vertebra.
   In mammals each end of the vertebra ossifies from a distinct
point, and constitutes a central Epiphysis of the vertebra;                                       and    in
many Vertebrata            a part   of the under surface of                   a    centrum ossifies
separately as a distinct Hypophysis.   It is another very general, if not
invariable rule,  that a distinct centre of ossification appears in, or
on, each neural semi-arc or Neurapophysis, and passes upwards, into
the spine or Metaneurapophysis; downwards, to unite sooner or later
with the diaphysis, or diaphysis and paraphysis; and outwards into
the diapophysis.
     It   is doubtful whether the paraphysis appears as a distinct osseous
element in any Vertebrata above the class                          of fishes, in very few of
which even, is it distinguishable               in the adult state.                   Consequently
in the higher Vertebrata the paraphysial region is ossified, either from
the diaphysis or from the neurapophysis, or from both; and a suture
exists for a longer or shorter time at the point of junction of the
neural and central ossifications.               I
                                    will term this the Neurocentral
suture.       Its position is no certain or constant indication                             of the
           of the parts above or below           it,   for        may vary            the same ver
                                                                                  to in

of   the paraphysial with the diaphysial region                      of   the centrum.
  The number         of   the centres     of   ossification        in   each distal         portion      of
the haemal semi-arc may vary greatly; the uppermost                                        is   called   a
Pleurapophysis,       the lower, Haemapophyses                    and Met-haemapophyses.
   Besides these primary centres    ossificationof                       of   a vertebra, there
are others     of
              less constancy.  Thus the ends                            of   the metaneurapo

fied from distinct centres; and in the caudal region of many of the
higher Vertebrata, outgrowths of the centra unite below to enclose
the caudal         vessels, and ossify as distinct apophyses.
     If the            of the skull be now compared with that of the

lateral walls are continuous with the laminae dorsales, and these pass
into    laminae ventrales, also continuous                       with those     the spinal region.
                                                                                   of
The       laminae       dorsales        of the head     become          the cranial walls and en
close the cerebrum—the                      continuation           of   the myelon;           the laminae
ventrales give rise                to   the boundaries           of   the future buccal and                   pha
ryngeal cavities.
     2.   But      at    this point the identity                 of   the skull with the spinal
column        ceases, and the very earliest steps                            in   histological differen
tiation exhibit the fundamental differences                                between       the two.   For,
in     the first place,            in     no   instance save the Amphioxus,                         has        the
notochord          as   yet been traced through the whole                           of   the floor       of    the
cranial cavity.               In   no   other embryo has              it   been yet seen           to    extend
beyond        the middle            vesicle     of     the cerebrum,               or   in   other words,
beyond the level              of   the rudiment         of   the infundibulum and pituitary
body.
     In   the second place, the division into somatomes,                                     in    all   known
vertebrate embryos, stops short                         at    the posterior boundary                     of    the
skull, and     traceno             of   such segmentation has yet been observed                                 in
the head itself.                                             -
     3.   Apparently          as
                              a         consequence      of      these fundamental differences,
the further course                 of    the development                of   the skull        is    in    many
respects very different from that                      of    a    vertebral column.                Chondri
fication takes place continuously                      on    each side        of   the notochord, and
beyond       it,   the two trabeculae            cranii, unlike anything                     in   the spinal
column, extend along the base                      of   the cranium.                 No distinct carti
laginous centra, and consequently                       no   intercentra, are ever developed.
The occipital arch             is   developed     in   a    manner remotely similar                      to   that
in   which the neurapophysial                   processes         are formed;            but the walls          of
the auditory capsules, which                     lie   in    front      of   them, and which give
rise    to   some        of   the parts, most confidently                     regarded        as    neurapo

physes by the advocates of the current vertebral theories of the skull,
are utterly unlike neurapophyses in their origin.
     So,    if we      seek for haemal           semi-arcs, we find something very like
them, arising from the substance of the basis cranii beneath the
auditory cartilage; but there is none connected with the occipital
                                                                car
tilage, and none with the rudiment of the alisphenoid. The palato
pterygoid cartilage might be regarded as the haemal semi-arc of the
presphenoidal                region, though the grounds for so doing are not very
strong; but the premaxillary                          cartilage is something                 quite without
parallel in the spinal column.
     4. The mode of ossification of the skull, and the ultimate arrange
ment       of    its   distinct bony elements, are                      at    once curiously          like, and
singularly unlike those presented                           by   the spinal column.                The basi
occipital       is   ossified precisely after the manner                        of  a   vertebral centrum.

ossific deposit, which takes place                        on     the under surface              of    the basal
cartilage  front in               of   the basioccipital, and extends thence completely
beneath the pituitary interspace                        as   far    as                                  might          be

utmost the notochord only extends into                                  its   posterior extremity.
     In    some       of    the higher Vertebrata,                 as   the snake, the osseous                 basi
sphenoid arises               in   the substance        its of      cartilaginous rudiment, while
the osseous presphenoid underlies                           its
                                                              cartilage.            In   others, both bones
appear          to   arise directly     their cartilaginous forerunners.

parietals, the presphenoid,                  orbitosphenoids, and frontals represent
the elements of two vertebral centra and neural arches, what is to
be made         of the petrous and mastoid bones?
     The difficulty has         been eluded by terming the petrosal a                               “   sense

neither of       these explanations can be received                   for   a       moment by those
who are acquainted with the development of the skull, or with the
true homologues of the bones in question in the vertebrate series,
or who think that scienti<U+FB01>c terms should always possess                                         a   well-de
<U+FB01>ned and single meaning.
     What, in fact, is          the    origin of the petrous and mastoid bones?
There is much reason for believing (according to Remak’s late obser
vations) that the membranous labyrinth is primarily an involution
of the sensory or epidermic layer of the blastoderm; but however
this may be, it is quite certain that the auditory organ                                  is,   primarily,
altogether independent of the walls of the skull, and that  may be                              it
detached without causing any  lesion of them, in young embryos.
     It   is   also quite certain that this membranous        labyrinth becomes
invested by       a    coat   of cartilage, continuous with the cranial wall; but
I do not know that there               is   evidence,       at present, to enable one to say
positively, whether this cartilaginous auditory capsule                                  is   formed in
dependently around the labyrinth, and then unites with the cranium;
or whether        it   is   an outgrowth from the cranial walls, which invests
and encloses        the labyrinth.            If   the latter be the case,                a     consistent
vertebral theory of the skull must account for all the bones deve
loped out of the auditory capsule;                          if   the former,        it   must exclude
them all, as parts of an extra-vertebral sensory skeleton.
     Now the      bones developed in the capsule are, in front, the petrosal;
behind, the mastoid;             above, the epiotic.                The <U+FB01>rst-named                  bone   is
admitted, by the most zealous advocates of the vertebral theory, to
be   a    neurapophysis, in all oviparous Vertebrata.                               Hence they are
also bound to admit that,                   for three centra below and three neural
spines bounding the cranial cavity above, there are four pairs of
neural arches.  More than this,   do not see how
                                               I     to be denied           it       is
that the true mastoid           is    the morphological equivalent of the petrosal;
                                                                                      2
                                                                                      o
                                                                                      2

                                                     432
and in that case there would be five neurapophyses to three central
and three neural spines.                   Furthermore,           it is precisely to these two
superfluous            elements that the only two clear and obvious haemal
arches, the mandibular and hyoid, are attached.
    I confess I do not perceive how it is possible, fairly and consistently,
to reconcile           these    facts with any existing theory                      of the vertebrate
composition of the skull, except by drawing ad libitum upon the Deus
ex machind           of the speculator, -imaginary “confluences,” “conna
tions,” “irrelative repetitions,”                    and shiftings of position—by whose
skilful application it would not                       be    difficult to devise half a dozen
very pretty vertebral theories,                      all    equally true,          in   the course          ofa
summer's day.
    Those who, like myself, are unable                           to   see the propriety           and       ad
vantage         of     introducing into         science       any ideal conception, which                     is
other than the simplest possible generalized expression                                     of   observed
facts, and who view with extreme aversion, any attempt                                     to   introduce
the phraseology and mode                    of   thought         of   an   obsolete and scholastic
realism into biology, will,               I     think,      agree     with     me, not     only        in   the
negative conclusion, that the doctrine                           of   the vertebral composition
of of
        the skull      is   not proven, but       in   the positive belief, that the relation
        the skull       to   the spinal column         is    quite different from that                 of   one
part      of   the vertebral column             to   another.
  The fallacy involved   the vertebral theory                              of of

                                                                                          be

fish, whereas,  truth, fish and mammal start from
                         in                         common point,                   a
and each follows its own road thence. So    conceive what the facts   I
teach        us   is   this:—the spinal column and the skull start from the
same         primitive        condition—a common central plate with                             its   laminae
dorsales and ventrales—whence they immediately begin                                       to   diverge.
    The spinal column                in   all   cases becomes             segmented      into    its   soma
tomes;         and,      in   the great majority            of   cases,     distinct centra and             in
tercentra          are      developed,      enclosing          the        motochord more              or    less
completely.
    The cranium never                 becomes        segmented            into somatomes;             distinct
centra and intercentra, like those                     of   the spinal column, are never                    de
veloped                                  the basis cranii lies beyond the notochord.
               in                   of
               it.          Much
        In   the process       of   ossification there           is   a   certain analogy between

                                          433
 the spinal column and the cranium, but that analogy becomes weaker
 and weaker as we proceed towards the anterior end of the skull.
     Thus it may       be  right to   say, that there is a primitive     identity of
 structure between the spinal or vertebral column and the skull                 ; but
 it is no more true that the adult skull is          a modi<U+FB01>ed vertebral column,
 than it would be, to affirm that the vertebral column is a modi<U+FB01>ed
 skull*.
     While <U+FB01>rmly entertaining this belief, however, I by no means wish
 to deny the interest and importance of inquiries into the analogies
 which      obtain   between     the segments,     which     enter into the com
 position     of the ossi<U+FB01>ed cranium, and the            vertebrae   of  an ossi<U+FB01>ed
 spinal column.         But all such inquiries must start with the recogni
 tion of the fundamental truths furnished by the study of develop
 ment, which, as our knowledge at present stands, appear to me to be
 summed up in the following propositions              :-
     1.  The notochord of the vertebrate embryo            ends in that region      of
 the basis cranii which ultimately lies behind the centre of the basi
 sphenoid bone.
    2. The basis cranii is never segmented.
    3. The lamina perpendicularis of the ethmoid has the same mor
 phological value as the presphenoid.
    4. The petrosal has the same morphological value as the mastoid                   ;
 if one   is not an integral part of the skull, neither is the other.
    5.   The nasal     bones are not neurapophyses.
    6. The branchial         arches   have   the same morphological        value as
 the hyoid, and the latter as the mandibular are.
    7. The mandibular arc is primitively            attached behind the point of
 exit from the skull, of the third division of the <U+FB01>fth nerve.
    8. The premaxilla         is originally    totally distinct from the palate
maxillary arcade.
    9. The pectoral arch is originally totally distinct from the skull.
    Starting on this basis, it might not be di<U+FB01>icult to show that the
perfectly ossi<U+FB01>ed        skull is divisible into a series of segments,        whose
analogy with       vertebrae    is closer the nearer they lie to the occipital
region; but the relation is         an analogy and not an a<U+FB02>inity, and these
cephalic sclerotomes are not vertebrae.

                                 I.—On            the    Mastoid in Birds.
  The true mastoid of the bird seems hitherto to have escaped notice.
  Hallmann says (l.c. p. 33), “In the disarticulated skulls of chickens,                                        I
examined the share taken by the different bones in the formation of the
labyrinth, by introducing bristles into the semicircular canals, and                                            I
found in the proper petrosum (into which the facial and acoustic nerves
enter, and which contains the cochlea) the anterior crus of the anterior
canal     (I
          term the upper one thus for ready comparison with reptiles)
and of the external canal; in the supraoccipital, the upper (=posterior)
crus   of the anteriorcanal, and the upper end of the posterior canal; and
in the exoccipital, the lower crus of the posterior, and the posterior of the
external canal.    In other words, the distribution of the canals is as in
the scaly Amphibia. For the rest, in birds as in mammals, and probably
in all Vertebrata, the membranous semicircular canals are formed con
nectedly in the cartilage, and the bony parts only gradually invest them.
Hence, when the chick's skull is too young, but very little of the posterior
canal is to be found in the supraoccipital, which in fact contains some
what less of the posterior canal than of the anterior,
                                                 -     and thereby departs
from reptiles and approximates mammals.
   “At a certain period also, an interval filled with cartilage, through which
the semicircular canals shine, is found in the bird's skull between the
supraoccipital, the parietal, the squama temporis, and the exoccipital.                                         I
see this clearly in the skull of a young Dicholophus cristatus (No. 5605,
B. M.). In the skeleton of a young Colymbus cristatus (No. 7172, B.M.),
I  find that this interval             is,
                                  the right side, almost filled
                                              on                     by   small                 up      a
bony plate, which has not        yet combined with the surrounding bones.

This appears      me to       separate pars mastoidea, which however com
                             to   be   a

better shown.     Subsequently         altogether indistinguishable from the

I     have endeavoured      show, however, that the true mastoid
                                  to                                    the bird                     of

or rather with the zygomatic                          portion of that bone in mammals             (I.   c.
p. 171).
   Professor  Owen (Principes d’Ostéologie Oomparée,          §5) adopts Cu         p.
vier’s argument, and pushes       further, endeavouring to show that the dis

appearance of the squamosal, and as he supposes of the petrosal, from the
interior of the skull in Reptilia, su<U+FB02>icient to account for that retzrogression
                                                 is
of the alisphenoid behind the exit of the <U+FB01>fth nerve, which    the neces                 is
sary consequence of his identification of the true petrosal with the ali
sphenoid.
  It seems strange that Cuvier should have advanced so weak an argu
ment as that which have cited for assuredly Ruminants are not very
                          I                            ;
low in the mammalian scale, nor are they those mammals which most
nearly approach reptiles or birds. We must seek these among rodents
and monotremes, in both of which the squamosal enters largely into the
composition of the cranial walls.
  This     particularly the case in that especially reptilian mammal the
            is
Echidna. As to birds,     can still less be said that their squamosal dis
                                   it
appears from the interior of the skull. Kostlin says on this point    Bau                      (‘
des knochernen Kopfes,’       206), “The squamosal contributes
                                        p.                           small                    a

middle one. It        here applied above against the parietal, anteriorly
                         is
against the anterior, and posteriorly against the posterior sphenoidal

the skull.    In the goose its extent        far smaller than in the fowl.

The actual size of the ala temporis, however, surpasses that of its inner
surface by    great deal. In this respect birds are analogous to the Cheiro
                 a
ptera, Insectivora, and     few Marsupialia, where only
                                   a                            small portion        a
of the squama temporis projects into the cranial cavity.          Still more
do they resemble the seals, in which this part          entirely enclosed by is
the parietal         and ala temporis,                and so     is   completely   separated from the
petrosal.”   Ktistlin   in error, however, in assuming that the squamosal

above, such     not the case in the ostrich.

   The struthious skull then a<U+FB02>'ords an important test of the value of Pro
fessor Owen’s argument.       If, as he supposes, the disappearance of the
squamosal from the interior of the skull causes the alisphenoid to pass
behind the exit of the trigeminal, this retrogression ought to have taken
place in the ostrich.    Nothing of the kind has occurred, however, the
trigeminal foramen being        trou de conjugaison’ between the alisphenoid

sphenoid, as in the sheep.
   It  isunnecessary to discuss the effect of the disappearance of the pe

     According to Kiistlin          (l.     c.   p.   216), the tympanic membrane of birds              is

  the squamosal, exoccipital, basisphenoid, and quadratum.             In many gal
  linaceous birds’ this frame does not come into contact with the quadratum
  at all.   From these circumstances, and from the fact that the quadratum
  of birds articulates with the lower jaw and the jugal arch, which is never
  the case with the tympanic ‘of mammals, Kostlin concludes, with great
  justice, that the quadratum is not the homologue of the mammalian

        IV.—On    the modz_'/ications of the palatosuspensorial  arch in Fishes.
I     I have very brie<U+FB02>y stated my views on this subject in the Quarterly
  Journal of Microscopical Science for October 1868, hoping at that time
  to enter more largely upon the subject in this place.            But the present
  Lecture and its notes already occupy so much space, that I must reserve
  a full statement of what I have to say respecting the palatosuspensorial
  apparatus of <U+FB01>shes for a future occasion.
                     V.—()n     the development   of the Cranium.
      In con<U+FB01>rmation of the views which           I  have adopted, as to the pri
  mary uniformity of plan of all vertebrate crania,          I  subjoin an abstract
  of Rathke’s most valuable account of the development of the skull in
   Coluber natritll‘, which contains much incidental information relating
  to the development of the skull in Vertebrata in general.              Vogt’s ob
  servations on Coregonus and Alytes, and my own on Gasterosteus, Rana
  and Triton, are in entire accordance with those of Rathke, so far as the
  primitive structure of the basis cranii is concerned.
      The differences between the basis of the skull and the vertebral
   column in the earliest embryonic condition are,—
      1. That round that part of the chorda. which belongs to the head, more
  of the blastema, that is to be applied, in the spinal colunm, to the forma
  tion of the vertebraa and their different ligaments, is aggregated than
  around the rest of its extent, and—
      2. That this mass grows out beyond _the chorda to form the cranial
   trabeculae.
      The lateral trabeculae at their <U+FB01>rst appearance formed two narrow
   and not very thick bands, which consisted of the same gelatinous sub
  stance as that which constituted the whole investment of the chorda,
   and were not sharply de<U+FB01>ned from the substance which lay between
   them and at their sides, but seemed only to be two thickened and some
   what more solid, or denser, parts of that half of the basis of the cranium,
  which lies under the anterior cerebral vesicle.
      Posteriorly, at their origin, they were separated by only a small
  interval, equivalent to the breadth of the median trabecula, and thence
  swept in an arch to about the middle of their length, separating as they
  passed forwards; afterwards they converged, so that, at their extremities,
   they were separated by a very small space, or even came into contact.
   Altogether they formed, as it were, two horns, into which the investing

                                               437
    mass of the chorda was continued forwards.          The elongated space between
    them, moderately     wide   in the  middle,   was  occupied by a layer of softer
    formative substance, which was very thin posteriorly, but somewhat
    thicker anteriorly.      Upon this layer rested the infundibulum; and in
    front of  it, partly on this layer, partly on the trabeculae, that division
    of the brain whence the optic nerves proceed, and further forwards the
    hemispheres of the cerebrum.         Anteriorly, both trabeculae reached as far
    as the anterior end of the head, and here bent slightly upwards, so that
    they projected      little into the frontal wall of the head, their ends lying
                        a
    in front of the cerebrum.       Almost at the end of each horn, however,          I
    saw small process, its immediate prolongation, pass outwards and form,
        a
    asit  were, the nucleus for      a small lateral projection of the nasal process
    of the frontal wall.
        The middle trabecula grows, with the brain, further and further into
    the cranial cavity, and as the dura mater begins to be now distinguishable,
it      becomes more readily obvious than before, that the middle trabecula
    raises up a  transverse fold of      it,
                                          which traverses the cranial cavity trans
     versely*.    The fold itself passes laterally into the cranial wall;         it   is
     highest in the middle, where    it encloses the median trabecula., and becomes
     lower externally, where    it  forms, as   itwere,    short ala proceeding from

_   the trabecula.      With
                           increasing elongation, the trabecula. becomes broader
    and broader towards     its free end, and, for short time, its thickness in
                                                        a

    lamella, and after short time (in the third period) entirely disappears.

                                                                    a

       In these animals, also, at certain very early period of embryonic
                                         a
    life,it elevates    fold of the dura mater which passes from one future
                          a
    petrous bone to the other, and after      certain time projects strongly into
                                                 a
    the cranial cavity. Somewhat later, however,        diminishes in height and

    layers of the fold which       had raised up coming into contact.

    this has happened, the fold diminishes in height and eventually vanishes,
    almost completely.
      The two lateral    trabeculae, which in the snake help to form the
    anterior half of the basis of the skull, attain greater solidity in the
                                                                a
    second period, acquire     greater distinctness from the surrounding parts,
                                a
    and assume      amore determinate form, becoming, in fact, <U+FB01>liform, so that
    the further forward, the thinner they appear. They increase only very
    little in thickness, but far more in length, during the growth of the head.
    Altogether anteriorly, they coalesce with one another, forming        part    a
      * What Rathke terms the ‘middle trabecula,’ appears to be only very indi
     stinctly developed in Fishes and /lmphibia.

                                         438
which lies between the two olfactory organs and constitutes a septum.
As   soon as these organs increase markedlyin size, this part is moderately
elongated and thickened, without however becoming so dense as the
hinder, longer part of the trabeculae.        The prolongations into the lateral
projections of the nasal processes, which now proceed from the coalesced
part in question, also become but little denser in texture for the present,
though they elongate considerably.
   The lateral parts and the upper wall of the cranium, with the excep
tion of the auditory capsules or of the subsequent bony labyrinth, remain
merely membranous up to the end of the second period, consisting in fact
only of the cutaneous covering, the dura mater, and a little interposed
blastema, which is hardly perceptible in the upper part, but increases in
                                                                                  '
the lateral walls, towards the base of the skull.
   The chorda vertebralis reaches, in very young embryos of the snake,
to between the auditory capsules, and further than this point it can be
traced neither in the snake nor in other Vertebrate, at any period of life,
as manifold investigations,        conducted‘ with especial reference to this
point, have convinced me.
   At the beginning of the third period, the basal plate chondri<U+FB01>es, at
<U+FB01>rst leaving the space beneath the middle of the cerebellum membranous;
but this also eventually chondri<U+FB01>es, and is distinguished from the rest of
the skull only by its thinness.
    Lateral processes grow out from the basal cartilage just in front of the
occipital foramen, and eventually almost meet above. They are the ex
occipitals.
    The two lateral trabeculae, parts which I have also seen in frogs,
lizards, birds, and mammals, chondrify at the beginning of the third
period.     At <U+FB01>rst, they pass, separate from one another throughout their
whole length, as far as the frontal wall, on entering which they come into
contact; are more separate posteriorly than anteriorly, and present, in
their mutual position and form, some similarity with the sides of a lyre.
But as the eyes increase, become rounder, and project, opposite the
middle of the trabeculae, downwards towards the oral cavity, the latter
are more and more pressed together, so that even in the third period they
 come to be almost parallel for the greater part of their length. Anteriorly,
 however, where they were already, at an earlier period, nearest to one
 another, they are also pressed together by the olfactory organs (which
 have developed at their sides to a considerable size), to such a degree,
 that they come into contact for a great distance and then completely
 coalesce; they are now most remote posteriorly, where the pituitary body
 has passed between them‘, so that they seem still to embrace it. Ante
 riorly, between the most anterior regions of the two nasal cavities, they
 diverge from their coalesced part as two very short, thin, processes or
 cornua, directed upwards, and simply bent outwards.
    “ It has been seen above that the median trabecula does not chondrify,
     * The pituitary body, however, as Rathke now admits, does not pass between
 the trabeculae,and  is developed in quite a different manner from that supposed in
 the memoir on Coluber.

                                      439
but eventually disappears; in its place, a truly cartilaginous short thick
band grows into the fold of dura mater from the cartilaginous basal plate.
  “Where the pituitary gland lies, there remains between the lateral
trabeculae of the skull a considerable gap, which is only closed by the
mucous membrane of the mouth and the dura mater. But there arises in
front of this gap, between the two trabeculae, as far as the point where
they have already coalesced, a very narrow, moderately thick, and ante
riorly pointed streak of blastema, which, shortly before the end of the
third period, acquires a cartilaginous character, and subsequently becomes
the body of the presphenoid*.
   “Altogether anteriorly, however, where the two trabeculee have coa
lesced, there grows outpof this part, from the two cornua in which it ends,
a pair of very delicate cartilaginous plates. At the end of the third period
both plates acquire a not inconsiderable size, take the form of two irre
gularly formed triangles, and are moderately convex above, concave below,
so as to be on the whole, shell-shaped.      The nasal bones are developed
upon these,  while   below them   are the nasal cavities, and the nasal glands
with their bony capsules.
   “ The also or lateral parts of the two sphenoids do not grow like the
lateral parts of the occipital bone out of the basis crauii, whose founda
tion is formed by the cephalic part of the chorda, but are formed sepa
rately from  it, although close to   it,in the, until then, membranous part
of the walls of the cranium.
   “ The alae of the presphenoid orbitosphenoids), which are observable not
                                 (
very long before the termination of the third period, appear as two truly
 cartilaginous (though they never redden), irregular, oblong, plates of mo
 derate thickness, lie in front of the optic foramina, at the sides of the
lateral trabeculae of the skull, ascend from them upwards and outwards,
and are somewhat convex on the side turned to the brain, somewhat con
cave on the other. The alae magnte (alisphenoids) are perceptible little   a
earlier than these. They are formed between the eye and the ear, and also
originally consist of colourless cartilaginous substance they appear at
                        a                                      ;
the end of the third period as irregular four-sided plates, lie at both
sides of the anterior half of the investing plate of the chorda, ascend
less abruptly than the alae orbitales, and are convex externally, internally
concave.
   “ The upper posterior angle of each elongates, very early, into process,
                                                                       a
which grows for certain distance backwards, along the upper edge of the
                   a
auditory capsule, and applies itself closely thereto.
   “The auditory capsules, or the future petrous bones1', chondrify, as         it
would appear, the earliest of all parts of the skull: the fenestra ovalis
arises in them by resorption.
   “ The
          ossz_'<U+FB01>catz'on of the snake’s skull commences in the basioccipital,  or
at any rate, this  is   one of the <U+FB01>rst parts to ossify. At little distance from

bone only represents    aportion of each auditory capsule.

the occipital foramen, there arises a very small semilunar bony plate, whose
concave edge or excavation is directed forwards; thereupon the bony
substance shoots from this edge further and further forwards, until at
length the bony plate has the form of the ace of hearts.              Its base
borders the fontanelle in the base of the skull, which lies under the
anterior half of the third cerebral vesicle, while its point is contiguous to
the occipital foramen; for the most part it is very thin, and only its axis
(and next to this its whole posterior margin) is distinguished by a greater
thickness.   The cephalic part of the chorda can be recognized in the axis
of this bony plate up to the following period. It passes from the posterior
to the anterior end of the bony plate, where it is lost, and is so invested
by the bony substance of the plate, that a smaller portion of the latter
lies on the upper side of the chorda, a larger portion beneath it. On this
account it forms, on the upper side of the plate, a longitudinal ridge,
which subsequently becomes imperceptible by the aggregation of matter
at the sides. On one occasion, however, I saw, in an embryo which was
almost at term, a similarly formed and sized bony cone, which, through
almost its entire length, appeared merely to lie on the body of the basi
occipital, since it had only coalesced with it below.”
   The nucleus and sheath of the cephalic part of the chorda become
gradually broken up and the last trace of them eradicated, as the ossi<U+FB01>ca
tion of the basioccipital proceeds, like the nucleus and sheath of the
rest of the chorda wherever a vertebral body is developed*.
   The articular condyle is not yet formed. The exoccipitals ossify through
their whole length and breadth.
   The body of the basisphenoid is formed between the above-mentioned
posterior fontanelle of the basis cranii and the pituitary space, ‘ therefore
far from the cephalic part of the chorda.’ It ossi<U+FB01>es by two lateral centres,
each of which forms a ring round the carotid canal.        The alisphenoids
ossify in their whole length and breadth ; the orbitosphenoid only slightly,
and the presphenoid not at all.       The premaxillary bone arises as an
azygos triangular cartilage between the cornua of the anterior ethmo
vomerine plate.               It
                       ossi<U+FB01>es from a single centre.
     “The auditory  capsule, or the future petrosal bone, may, even at the
end of this period, be readily separated from the other part of the cranial
wall, and still consists for the most part of cartilage. On the other hand,
the triangular form, which                    it had
                                  before, is not inconsiderably altered, since
it greatly elongates forwards,   and thus, as it were, thrusts its anterior
angle further  and further forwards, and becomes more unequal-sided.        At
the lower edge, or the longer side of                          it,

angle, at the beginning of this (third) period, or indeed somewhat earlier,
a diverticulnm of the auditory capsule begins to be formed (the rudi
mentary cochlea), and developes into     moderately long, blunt, and hollow

invested       by an inseparable sheath            of bony matter, just in the same way       as the
    urostyle            developed in the tail.

                                           441
    and also consists of cartilage. Close above, and somewhat behind this ap
    pendage, however, there appears, at about the same time, a small rounded
    depression, in which the upper end of the auditory ossicle eventually rests;
    and somewhat later, an opening appears in this depression which corre
    sponds with the fenestra rotunda of man.     Very much later, namely,
    towards the   end of this period, the auditory capsule begins to ossify.
    Ossi<U+FB01>cation commences in a thin and moderately long, hook-like process,
    which is sent forwards and inwards from the lower hollow diverticulum
    of the cartilage, and unites with the basisphenoid.         From this point it
    passes   upwards and backwards, and, for the present, extends so far that,
    at the end of this period, besides that process, the diverticulum in ques
    tion and about the anterior third of the auditory capsule itself, are ossi<U+FB01>ed.
    Later than at the point indicated, an ossi<U+FB01>c centre appears at the pos
    terior edge of the auditory capsule, where it abuts against the supra— and
    ex-occipitals, but extends from hence by no means so far forward as to
    meet that from the other point.        The middle, larger part of the auditory
    capsule, therefore, for the present, remains cartilaginous.
       “ In the beginning of the fourth
                                            period, a third ossi<U+FB01>c centre arises in
    the upper angle of the capsule, whereupon all three grow towards one
    another.     But the mode of enlargement and coalescence of these bony
    nuclei is very remarkable.      They do not unite with one another in such
    a manner as to form a continuous bony capsule for the membranous part
    of the labyrinth, but are permanently separated by cartilagino-mem
    branous and very narrow symphyses.          On the other hand, one coalesces,
_
    in the most intimate manner, with that edge of the supraoccipital which
    is nearest to  it,so that even in the more advanced embryos, this bone and
    it  form  a  moderately long oblong plate, each end of which constitutes        a
    small, tolerably deep, and irregularly-formed shell, containing part of the
                                                                            a
    anterior or upper semicircular canal. The second bony centre becomes
    anchylosed with the anterior edge of the lateral part of the occipital bone,
    and also forms     asmall, irregularly-shaped,   but longish scale, which con
    tains the deeper or lower part of the posterior cm of that semicircular
    canal, and besides this, the lower sac, or representative of the cochlea of
    the auditory labyrinth. The remaining bony mass of the auditory carti
    lage, however, includes the greater part of the membranous portion of the
    labyrinth, and  is the largest. The same phenomenon, viz. that the petrosal
    bone breaks up, as     itwere, into three pieces, of which two coalesce with
    the occipital bone, occurs also, according to my observations, in Lacerta
    agilwls, and probably takes place in like manner,       we may conclude from
                                                                if

                                           4.-4-2
  have given above, is based, partly on the observations of Vogt, Rathke, and
   Remak, and partly on my own. As great misunderstanding seems to me
  to have prevailed on this head,      I  have put together in the present note,
  all the most important evidence I have been able to collect on this highly
  interesting subject, accompanying it with a running commentary.           I have
  done this the more willingly, as the accounts of      the  mode of development
                                                             I
  of vertebrae in general, in our own language, which have met with, are
  strangely meagre.
                   Development   of  the Shiinal Column   in Fishes.
     1.  Blenniua viriparus (Rathke, ‘Bildungs- und Entwickelungsgeschichte
  des   Blennius vimparus.’ 1833).
     The surface of the notochord hardens, and acquires a <U+FB01>bro-membranous
  consistence, while its inner substance becomes glassy and transparent, so
  that the notochord is separated into sheath and contents, as in the lamprey.
  A segmentation next takes place in the sheath. “ At successive inter
  vals it increases, more and more, in density and solidity, acquires in places
 almost the constitution of cartilage, and there thus arise a great number
 of successive, very <U+FB01>ne, narrow rings, which are connected by much nar
 rower, far less solid, but also far less transparent and more whitish-coloured
 parts, like sutures.”
    When this segmentation has commenced, “ a number of cartilaginous,
 very short, thin and rod-like processes, which run in pairs from each
 member of the vertebral column, where its upper side passes into the two
 outer ones, appear, pass upwards in the walls surrounding the spinal mar
                                                                                   '
 row, and enclose its lower cords. At <U+FB01>rst, therefore, each pair of processes
 are separated by a considerable interval throughout their entire length.
 Subsequently their upper ends approximate (increasing in length, and at
 the same time accommodating            themselves to the curve of the spinal
 marrow, and bending round it) more and more closely, till they, at last,
 meet above the spinal marrow, and soon after this has happened, coalesce
 into an arch.
    “ Contemporaneously with these processes, and in the same way, there
 arise from the vertebral column (though only from its hinder half, or that
which constitutes the foundation of the tail) a number of other processes
similar in form and structure, which spring from the junction of the under
with the lateral faces of the column. These take the opposite direction
to the preceding, tend to enclose the great caudal vessels, and unite in
pairs into arches, which lie in a series and correspond with the vertebral
segments.”
    From the segments of that part of the vertebral column which lies
between the tail and the head, there grow out, in corresponding places to
those in which the crura of the inferior arches take their origin from the
vertebral segments of the tail, and in the same manner and at the same
time, many cartilaginous processes, which attain, however, only a very
slight length, and also take atransverse direction. They might be regarded
as lateral pieces of the transverse processes of the higher animals ; but it
is more probable that they correspond with the ribs of other Vertebrata.

                                        443
    “All   these processes are connected with the sheath, but not with the
core of the notochord.”
    As development advances, the ring-like segments increase in breadth,
length and thickness; at the same time they become somewhat cartilagi
nous, and then ossify.       Each widens somewhat more at its ends than in
the middle, and so appears a little contracted in the centre. It is only
after birth that such an internal thickening takes place as to interrupt
the cavity of the vertebral cent1'um.
    The sheath of the notochord is originally of one texture throughout, but
the smaller portions, which lie between the vertebral centra, assume a
<U+FB01>brous texture, contemporaneously with the appearance of the latter. The
included substance of the notochord loses its peculiar dense and elastic
character, becomes <U+FB01>rst gelatinous, then grumous, and <U+FB01>nally resembles a
thick serum.
    The crura of the upper and lower vertebral arches (in the tail) unite
in pairs, and their points of union grow out into spinous processes.
    The ossi<U+FB01>cation of the processes which arise from the vertebrae coin
mences at the point of junction of the process with the centrum.            “A
small bony point arises, which appears to belong to both centrum and pro
cess, and from whence ossi<U+FB01>cation extends into both.          In each vertebral
centrum, therefore, as well of the tail as of the trunk, ossi<U+FB01>cation pro
ceeds from different and distant points.”
    2. Cyprinus blicca (Von Bar, ‘Untersuchungen iiber die Entw. d. Fische.’
 1835).
    “ At the end of the <U+FB01>rst day the notochord is covered by something
which surrounds it like thin plates; these are the developing bodies of
vertebrae.      It is clearly observable that these bodies of vertebrae are not
 undivided rings surrounding the notochord, but that they consist of many
 pieces united by sutures.       This condition also is persistent in the stur
 geons.     The body of the vertebra, therefore, is formed of the coalescence
 of many pieces, and a lateral suture seems to indicate that these pro
 cesses are elongations of the previously observed upper and under verte
                                                  '
 bral arches.”
    Von Bar imagines that the unconstricted part of the notochord gives
 rise to the intervertebral ligaments.
   ‘From these observations of Rathke and Von Bar, it would appear as if
 the annular ossi<U+FB01>cations which surround the notochord arose by the co
 alescence of ossi<U+FB01>c centres, primarily developed at the junction of the apo
 physes with the centra.       My own observations on Gasterosteus, however,
 show, like those of Vogt on Coregonus, that the centra ossify from distinct
                                                             I
 rings deposited immediatelyround the notochord; and am very strongly
 inclined to believe that the corresponding primary annular diaphyses of
 the vertebrae in Cyprinus and Blemzius have been overlooked.
    3. C'0're_qonus palea (V ogt, ‘Embryologie des Saumones,’ 1842, p. 104 et
 seq.).—‘‘ But it is necessary to distinguish carefully between what we call
 vertebrae in the adult <U+FB01>sh, that is to say, those osseous or cartilaginous
 pieces intended for the support of the whole body, and more particularly
 of the spinal cord, and such vertebral divisions as we find in embryos. These

                                        444
 last are the general fact, the expression of a constant law according to
 which all the Vertebrata are developed.        The vertebrae of adult <U+FB01>shes, on
the other hand, are solid rings, whose presence depends on the type pecu
liar to each species; consequently their form, and the substance of which
they are composed, vary in almost every species.
    “ The vertebral divisions‘ appear very early in the C0reg0nus—alm0St
at the same time as the notochord; and when the dorsal groove begins to
close, they are <U+FB01>ne lines, caused, as it would appear, by a greater accu
mulation of embryonic cells, which, like transverse septa, traverse the
entire mass as far as the notochord.        These divisions extend forwards, as
far as the neighbourhood of the auditory vesicles, but there never exists
the smallest trace of them in the head itself.          At <U+FB01>rst they are visible
only in the middle of the body; by degrees they move forwards, as faras
close to the ear, and backwards, towards the tail, as far as it is formed; but
they invade its extremity only when it has attained its full length relatively
to the body.      At <U+FB01>rst these lines are all straight and perpendicular to the
axis of the chorda; but by degrees, and in proportion as development
advances, they become oblique and bend, forming an angle whose apex is
directed forwards, and corresponds exactly to the median line of the noto
chord.”
    They eventually become the intermuscular septa. Vogt goes on to
say,—“The typical structure of the Vertebrata, then, consists solely in
these rings of separation, which are formed around a notochord, and no
wise in the development of a distinct head, or of other solid pieces of
the skeleton, such as osseous or cartilaginous vertebrae,” illustrating his
case by the Amphiozus.
    Each osseous vertebra corresponds to two vertebral segments, namely,
to the half of that which precedes, and to the half of that which follows a
metasomatome; for it is where the latter reaches the notochord, that the
centra and arches take their origin. The centra arise as a double ring of
cartilage, internal and external to the sheath of the notochord.              The
intervertebral spaces always correspond with the middle of the interval
between two intermuscular septa, each of which is consequently inserted
into the middle of a centrum, while the superior and inferior arches are
developed in their plane.       They are ossi<U+FB01>ed only long after the centra,
which arise as bony rings around the notochord.          The intervertebral liga
ments are formed from the sheath of the notochord.
    4. Prof. Owen (Principes d’Ostéologie Comparée, 1855, p. 184) affirms
that “ In osseous <U+FB01>shes the centrum is ordinarily ossi<U+FB01>ed from six points,
of which four begin in the bases of the two neurapophyses and of the two
parapophyses, but the terminal concave plates of the centrum are ossi<U+FB01>ed
separately.”
    It is not stated on what <U+FB01>sh the observations on which this latter asser
tion is based were made. Prof. Williamson has already shown (“ On the
Development of the Scales and Bones of Fishes,” Phil. Trans. 1851) that
it is inconsistent with the structure of the adult vertebra; it is not sup
ported by any of those writers who have directly observed the develop
             * Mctasomatomes,  their interspaces being the somatomes.    Tii.

                                                                                   ”
period the notochord appears to be divided transversely into “ rondelles
or vertebrae, but these are not real divisions ; they are appearances pro
duced by the intersections of the muscles which surround the notochord,
and of the transverse vascular branches which accompany each pair of
nerves when it leaves the medulla. [Dugés thus describes the somatomes.]
    In  the second period, cartilaginous processes, adherent to the notochord,
appear in pairs and enclose the medulla.              There are as many of these
processes as vertebrae will in future exist, and two crests even make their
appearance, to form the walls of the coccygeal canal.           The apophyses are
at <U+FB01>rst little      tubercles;   they then bifurcate; one branch becomes the
transverse      process, the other the neurapophysis with its zygapophyses.
In B.    fuscus, A. obstetricans, punctatus, and Hg/la, where these vertebrae
ossify, “two clouds” of ossi<U+FB01>c matter make their appearance in each
vertebra, “ as distant from one another as they are from the lateral masses
or apophyses,” and eventually unite above the notochord so as to form a
quadrate ossi<U+FB01>c centre.         This qua/drate mass enlarges, but remains con
cave,    not   only above,   but also in front and behind, and especially below,
where it     forms   a semi-canal or groove, in which the notochord is lodged.
The groove is gradually <U+FB01>lled up, the notochord undergoing a contem
poraneous atrophy, and becoming eventually reduced to a mere ligament.
The intervertebral        masses are formed altogether independently          of the

    In Rana,     on the other band, the primitive centre of ossi<U+FB01>cation of the
body     of the   vertebra is a ring completely enclosing the chorda, in other
respects      the   development      of the spinal column resembles that just
described.                  .
    2.  Miiller (Vergleichende Anat. d. Myxinoiden, 1835) remarks, “that
the formation of the primitive elements of the skull (which are different
from the secondary osseous ones) takes place in the higher animals, con
stantly in the same way, is much to be doubted, since variations of the
fundamental plan obtain in the vertebral column.             In many Batrachia, as
 Cultrzjaes provincialzk, and Rana paradoxa, the bodies of the vertebrae arise
only out of the upper primitive vertebral elements.             I found, indeed, in
the larva of Rana paradoma, on the under part of the circumference of the
chorda dorsalis, a cartilaginous band which was especially well developed
-posteriorly, in front of the ossi<U+FB01>cation of the coccygeal spine, and was con
 tinued, thinner, along the under surface of the chorda, for half the length
 of the future vertebral column. This cartilaginous band had no fellow, but
 on the contrary, was thickest in the middle.           In the caudal part of the
 chorda it diminished until it gradually disappeared, so that the inferior
 arches surrounding the caudal vessels were merely <U+FB01>brous productions of
 the external sheath of the chorda.           But this inferior cartilaginous band
 on the chorda of the larva of Rana paradozra disappears in the greater

part of the spinal column, and merely a part of it ossifies to become the
basilar part of the coccyx, which Dugès was acquainted with, as well as
with the two vertebrae of the coccyx above the chorda: the basilar bone
is not a body of a vertebra, but coalesces subsequently with the inferior
circumference of the coccygeal vertebrae.        In these frogs, the coccyx is
the  only part  which arises from both    upper  and lower vertebral elements;
all the other vertebrae arise in Cultripes   and Rana, merely from the upper
primitive vertebral elements, which in the course of ossification become
divided into arches and central portions.         It is only the ossifications of
the coccyx which, in these frogs, completely enclose the chorda, since that
part is eventually composed of two pairs of vertebrae, and a long basilar
piece, whose sutures are retained even in the adult R. paradoxa.” (p. 130).
   3. Alytes.—With respect to the development of the vertebrae in Alytes
obstetricans, Vogt (Entwickelungsgeschichte der Geburtshelferkröte, 1842)
states that cartilaginous rings appear in the sheath of the chorda, as
rudiments of the centra. Contemporaneously with these the cartilaginous
neural arches are developed in the wall of the canal of the medulla;
nothing is said as to the mode of ossification.
   4. In both Rana temporaria and Triton, I find that the diaphysis of the
vertebra arises as a saddle-like patch, upon, and in immediate contact with,
the dorsal surface of the notochord; the layer of osseous matter is at first
exceedingly thin, and gradually extends round the notochord until in most
of the frog's vertebrae, and in all of those of the Triton, it forms a complete
ring. The osseous deposit in the arches is quite distinct, and has, in the
frog, the form of a thin bony sheath investing their cartilaginous basis.
The diaphysis of the sacral vertebra remains open below long after the
others, and after its neural arch is completely ossified.
   5. The development of the coccyx of the anourous Batrachia has been
well described by Dugès (l.c. p. 108).        The two neural arches originally
formed in this region ossify and unite above the spinal cord, and at the same
time two osseous centra, which very soon coalesce with them, are formed.
These centra are incomplete arcs, open below, where they embrace the
notochord.    A long cartilaginous plate, however, arises on the ventral
surface of the notochord, extending backwards far beyond the level of
these posterior coccygeal vertebrae.       It ossifies, and eventually becomes
anchylosed   with the bodies of the coccygeal vertebrae to form the coccyx.
Such is the substance of Dugès' views, which, as has been seen, have been
confirmed in all essential points by Müller.
   Prof. Owen, however, gives a very different account of the matter.
   “The vertebrae of the tail of the larvae of the Anura are seen distinctly
only in the aponeurotic stage. When chondrification occurs, the opera
tion of absorption and coalescence takes place, and two long neurapophyses
only are established on each side; the ossification of these plates extends       .
into the fibrillar sheath of the rest of the coccygeal notochord, and
when the perishable parts of the tail of the larva have been absorbed,
and the fore- and hind-legs are developed, they constitute by their
connation the elongated, osseous coccygeal style, often hollow, of the
anourous Batrachia.” (Principes d'Ostéologie, 1855, p. 186.)

                                        447
  Prof. Owen does not state on what anourous batrachian his observations
were made, nor does he notice the wide discrepancy between his views
and those of Duges.       I
                        have carefully studied the development of the
coccyx in the common frog, and my observations are in entire agreement
with those of Dugés. Nothing can be more clear than the primitive entire
independence of the inferior cartilaginous plate, which by its ossi<U+FB01>cation
constitutesthe major part of the coccygeal style, from the two neurapo
physes and the rudimentary diaphyses which correspond with them.
              _   Developmentof the Qrinal Column of Rqatilia.
  1.   Qahidia    (Rathke, ‘Entw. der Natter,’ l839).—“ Quadrate    plates of
a more solid substance than the rest   of the blastema appear on each side
of the notochord, in the middle of the body, where they are at <U+FB01>rst
largest, diminishing in size backwards and forwards.    At <U+FB01>rst they extend
neither into the dorsal nor into the ventral plates of the embryo.
   “ These plates increase in length, and those of each pair grow towards
one another above and below.      Each plate grows out into two branches
above and below.      The inner branches lie in close contact with the noto
chord, and coalesce with those of the opposite side, so as to form rings
which eventually become the bodies of the vertebrae. The upper outer
branch extends into the wall of the neural canal, and, eventually uniting
with its fellow, forms the neural arch. The lower outer branch extends
into the ventral wall and becomes the rib.”
   The ring grows both externally and internally, so as to constrict the
notochord (which softens and acquires a grumous consistence), and then
becomes converted into bone, so that the notochord is surrounded by a
series of bony rings.   The notochord takes no part in the formation of the
articular intervertebral surface, which is an apophysis and not an epiphy
sis ; the neural arches ossify much later than the centrum, from a single
point in the middle of each. The inferior processes are outgrowths of the
substance of the vertebra, and in the caudal region are, from the <U+FB01>rst,
double.
   “On each side of the body of the vertebra, where the ribs and the
vertebral arches radiate from     it,the condensed blastema of which      it
originally consists, grows out slowly, but considerably, and becomes deve
loped (gradually undergoing chondri<U+FB01>cation) into       plate, whose largest

thickness, and which gradually drives the rib and vertebral arch further
away from the axis of the vertebral column.     At the end of this period
it almost as thick as the length of the vertebra;
  is                                                    then appears, when

angles passes into the body of the vertebra, and one of whose shorter sides
is turned outwards and upwards.      From this side passes one crus of the
vertebral arch, while from the side which      turned outwards and down
                                                  is

the vertebra, only mediately, by the plate in question.

ends, the process commencing very soon after the ossi<U+FB01>cation of the
centra; but after ossi<U+FB01>cation has begun in them, these originally filiform
parts widen into broad oblong plates, which, in the greater part of the
body, come into contact only towards the end of the period, and in the
tail and hindermost part of the body, only in the following period.
   “ The ribs ossify far later, and also from the middle towards the end.
Before, however, an ossi<U+FB01>c centre is developed in them, the cartilage, of
which the rib now for the most part consists, becomes articulated with
the rest of the vertebra.       The plate, lastly ", which forms the union
between a rib, a vertebral arch and a vertebral body, and subsequently
forms a part of the body of the vertebra, ossi<U+FB01>es only in the following
period.
   “The relation of the ribs to the bodies of the vertebrae, therefore, is
originally just the same as that of the crura of the vertebral arches to
them: just as one of these crura, does each rib arise as an outward growth
of that vertebral body which is the <U+FB01>rst formed of all these parts; whilst,
however, the crura of the vertebral arches are directed upwards in order
to enclose the spinal cord, the ribs grow downwards to enclose the viscera.
of organic life, and in this way their greater length in the snake, and a
multitude of other Vertebrata, is explicable.
   “ The transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae exhibit the same rela
tions to the bodies of the vertebrae, as the ribs in the dorsal region.     They
arise in the same places as these; become, in like manner, removed, together
with the crura of the arches, by lateral outgrowths of the body from its
axis; and, before the ribs are articulated, they pass quite imperceptibly into
the processes in question.     The transition is the more remarkable, as in the
snake the hindermost rib is split, in just the same manner as the transverse
processes of the three or four succeeding caudal vertebrae.
   “ If we consider, in the <U+FB01>rst place, the relation of the parts in the adult
snake, we <U+FB01>nd that the penultimate rib, near its upper or inner end,
gives off from its upper side, a small process directed upwards and out
wards; however, in the last rib this process is about a quarter as long as
the remaining part of the rib, which lies external to and below           so that  it,
the whole bone has the form of       atwo-prong-ed hay-fork,   not  yet fastened
toa   handle, and one of whose prongs        for the most part broken off. The
                                               is
same fundamental form       ispossessed by the transverse process of the <U+FB01>rst
caudal vertebra; and the diiference between            and the rib which lies
                                                             it,
immediately before    it, lies principally in this, that       not, like the rib,
                                                                   it   is
articulated
             with  its vertebra, that its upper half or prong      almost equal
                                                                              is
in length to the lower, and that, regarded as awhole,           not half so long
                                                                    it   is
as the hindermost rib.      The transverse processes of the succeeding caudal
vertebrae have quite the same fonn as their predecessors, but gradually
diminish in length backwards.         As to the development of the ribs and
transverse processes in question, they, like almost all the other ribs, are
originally sent out as quite simple rays from the bodies of their vertebrae              ;
very soon, however, there arises on the upper side and neck of the ray
where it  passes out from the vertebral body, an outgrowth which elongates
                             *
                                 Paraphysial    cartilage.

more or less, also assumes a ray-like form, and has its free end directed
outwards.   Thus a fork is produced, whose one prong is more or less
thicker than the other.”
   Rathke suggests that the accessory ribs of many <U+FB01>sh are probably de
veloped in this way, the upper prong becoming articulated with the lower.
   “The two or three anterior subvertebral processes in the tail are, and
remain, quite simple, like the similar processes of the cervical and many
dorsal vertebrae. The two halves of the others, which arose as separate
lateral processes, remain permanently distinct.
   “ All the
               newly commencing inferior processes arise as paired out
growths   of the bodies of the vertebrae.”
   “ The ribs are not less
                            outgrowths (ausstrahlungen) of the bodies of the
vertebrae than the crura of the arches, as I can say from my investigations
on <U+FB01>shes, snakes, lizards, birds, and mammals ; even when the bodies of the
vertebra) are completely chondri<U+FB01>ed, the ribs form a connected whole with
them, but subsequently they become articulated, and are thereby essentially
distinguished from the crura of the vertebral arches. In some animals the
articulation takes place and remains close to the bodies; in others it takes
place also close to the bodies, yet, afterwards, a process grows out between
the rib and the body, by which the rib is more or less thrust out; this is
the transverse process; where it occurs, the rib          in all cases, at <U+FB01>rst
                                                           is,
united only with it; sometimes, however, a process grows out from the
rib (the so-called head with its neck), by which   becomes immediately
                                                       it
attached to the body of the vertebra itself, so that       doubly united

with the body. In many cases the rib may also become articulated at some
distance from the body, and thus break up into rib and transverse pro
cess.”
   “ As respectsthe ribs of the higher Vertebrata, together with their trans
verse processes, the development of the, snake teaches us, that although
they are subsequently seen to be in close connexion with the crura of the
vertebral arches, they grow out, not from the base of these arches, but far
from them, out of the bodies of the vertebrae themselves where they have
                                                                  ;
arisen, however, each lateral half of the body of the vertebra increases in
thickness, in such a  manner that  it acquires an ala, which drives the ems
of the vertebral arch and the rib further and further from the a.xis,'until
at lengthit  appears as acommon trunk for both, and therefore may easily
deceive one into supposing, that the rib   is given off from the base of the
crus of the arch, and  is  process from it.”

1855).—The upper and middle (sensory and motor) layers of the germ

plate thicken and leave between them a groove, the primitive groove; im

in the axis of the motor layer. The sensory layer of the axial plate is
now the medullary plate; from         the nervous centre
                                        it                    developed; the

vertebral plate.
   The primitive V6I't6l)1‘€B (Urwirbel, somatomes) <U+FB01>rst appear in the dorsal
part of the embryo, as opaque portions of the substance of the primitive
vertebral plates, which extend from the sides of the chorda into the lateral
plate, or that thickened part of the motor layer with which the primitive
vertebral plates are immediately continuous.      These primitive vertebrae
are the result of   sort of segmentation of the motor layer; they acquire a
                      a
cubical form, and are separated by clear, narrow, interspaces (metasoma
tomes).
  At the beginning of the third day the ventral surface of each primitive

 having merged into one convex face; the surface turned towards the

 lamellar processes, which, coalescing with those of the other side, sur
round the notochord and constitute the blastema of the vertebral column.
   The dorsal layer of the primitive vertebra becomes converted into
muscle, and forms        segment of the dorsal muscles; the anterior portion
                           a
of its substance, beneath this, becomes the spinal ganglion; the posterior,
the rudiment of the neural arch and rib. The latter extends backwards
beyond the boundary of its primitive vertebra into the region of the next,
so that  it   appears to be divided by the clear line of separation into       a
larger anterior and smaller posterior portion.
   The axial portion of the vertebral column does not become segmented
in correspondence with the divisions between the primitive vertebrae,~
but midway between them, so that the lines of separation between the
primitive vertebrae correspond with the centres of the permanent vertebrae,
each of which may thus be said to be formed by the coalescence of the
posterior half of the axis of one primitive vertebra with the anterior half
of the next following.

In the dorsal vertebrae, on the other hand, there is formed at the <U+FB01>fteenth
day, independently of these rings, a broad though thin bony plate on the
upper, and a second on the lower face of the centrum, with which the sub
stance of the ring, as it extends, coalesces. The notochord at the eighteenth

thread.”

    Rathke,     ‘
                  Schildkriiten,’ pp. 66, 67.—‘‘ In the pig and sheep the
bony substance is deposited immediately around the notochord, in such
a manner that, at <U+FB01>rst, as in birds, it forms a narrow and thin ring, from
which it passes partly towards the surface, partly towards the ends of the
separate centra, and after a time reaches the surface, but not the ends. To
complete the centra, there arise in the latter two special disks of bone for
each vertebra, which afterwards apply themselves to the previously
ossi<U+FB01>ed middle part, and wholly coalesce with it.
    “ In pig-embryos of 1 in. to 1 in. 3 lines in length, the notochord ran
straight through the already existing rudiments of the intervertebral liga
ment like a delicate <U+FB01>lament ” (p. 77).
    Bischo<U+FB02>, in his various works, shows that the earliest changes in the
vertebral column of mammals are the same as in birds.
    “ In like manner as in the Marnmalia and birds, the ribs in the Chelonia
grow out as simple rays from the neural arches (Bogenschenkeln) of the
 vertebrae, quite close to their bodies. Very close to the places where they
 have arisen, however, the ribs of birds and mammals send, as a rule, a
 process downwards and inwards, which increases more or less in length
 and thickness, enlarges somewhat at its free end, and becomes closely
 applied thereby to one, or two, bodies of vertebrae, by the intermediation
 of the articular capsule which now becomes formed. This process is the
 neck and head of the rib.”—-Rathke, Schildkriiten, p. 97.
     “ The cervical transverse
                                  processes of birds and Mammalia attain their
 forked form in quite a different manner from the ribs, namely, by the
 coalescence at one end, of what are properly two transverse processes
 which have grown out of the vertebra, while, on the other hand, a rib has
 become forked, because, though originally a perfectly          simple ray,  it has
 sent out a secondary process from one of its ends.”
     It results from the observations which have just been detailed, that
 with    certain real or apparent exceptions which have been duly noted,
  there is a very great uniformity in the mode of development          of the ver
  tebral column in all Vertebrata.
     The primary processes up to, and inclusive of, segmentation or division
  into somatomes, appear to be the same in all; and there is every reason to
  believe that the somatomes become di<U+FB01>erentiated in the same general
  way *. There seems to be no difference, save in degree, in the ch0ndri<U+FB01>
     * The relations of the ganglion to the rudiment of the rib and neural arch and
  segment of the dorsal muscles in the mouse’s    embryo  are the same as in that of

cation which takes place in the immediate neighbourhood of the notochord
and in the neural and haemal arches. The intercentra correspond in fishes,
as in Amphibia and birds, to the middle of each somatome; and it does
not appear that they are, to any appreciable extent, produced by the
metamorphosis    of the notochord.
  When ossification takes place, the diaphysis appears as a ring, or part of
a ring, in immediate contact with, or very close proximity to, the noto
chord, which it usually embraces completely, though in the rare case of
some Amphibia, only partially.     The diaphysis then increases inwards so
as to constrict the notochord, and outwards, so as to invade the centrum
more and more.       A distinct ossification is commonly formed in each
neural arch, and one or more others in each haemal arch.
   In the higher or abranchiate oviparous Vertebrata there would seem to
be no other centres of ossification in the vertebra than the five just men
tioned, except those of the terminal epiphyses.     In fishes, on the other
hand, a distinct centre—which might be termed the paraphysis—is occa
sionally found in the paraphysial portion of the centrum.
   The dorsal vertebrae of a young carp exemplify this structure remarkably
well. The diaphysis is represented by an annular osseous ring, which
surrounds the notochord and gives off a vertical median process or plate,
and two inferolateral plates, which unite the hollow bony cones into
which the osseous ring dilates in front and behind.            The ossified neur
apophyses expand into wedge-like lower ends, which embrace the vertical
plate of the diaphysis, and whose apices come into contact with                                                 its
annular part.

                                                         suture, which maya                                     be
termed the “neurocentral suture.”
  It is   very commonly        assumed that this neurocentral                          suture   is   a   sort   of

                                      453
morphological landmark, and that it always indicates the boundary between
the neurapophysis on the one hand, and the diaphysis or osseous centrum
on the other; so that any process which is given off from the vertebra
above the suture, is supposed to arise from the neurapophysis, while those
given off below it only, are said to arise from the centrum.
    It is only necessary to cite a few facts, which may be readily veri<U+FB01>ed,
however, to show that the neurocentral suture is of no value as a test of
the nature of the parts above and below it.
    In man and in the pig, the heads of the ribs, whether dorsal or cervical,
are (as Retzius has well pointed out) articulated above the neurocentral
suture; and therefore, if we accept the ordinary de<U+FB01>nition, not to the
centrum at all, but to the neurapophysis.       Furthermore, if we accept the
ordinary view, the “inferior transverse processes” in the neck of these
animals are not parapophyses, but second diapophyses, inasmuch as they
arise from the neurapophyses, and not from the centrum.
    The “ transverse processes ” of the lumbar vertebrae are usually given
off above the neurocentral suture, and are therefore called “ diapophyses.”
In a young Dugong, in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons,           I
<U+FB01>nd that, in the two hinder lumbar vertebrae, these transverse processes
are given off below the neurocentral suture.
    In theEchz'dna the head of every rib is attached to the centrum, or below
the neurocentral suture; and in the neck, this suture lies between the
 upper and lower transverse processes.
    Thus, if we follow out logically the view that the neurocentral suture
 indicates the boundary between the neurapophyses and the centrum, and
 if we accept the current de<U+FB01>nition of diapophyses and parapophyses, we
 arrive at the conclusion, that, in the cervical region, man and the pig have
 vertebrae with two diapophyses and no parapophysis, while the monotreme
 has a parapophysis and a diapophysis on each side; that, in the dorsal re
 gion, the ribs in man and the pig are connected only with the neurapo
 physes, while in the monotreme they articulate only with the centra; that
 the transverse processes of the anterior lumbar vertebrae of the dugong
 are diapophyses, while those of the posterior ones are parapophyses!
    The crocodile and some extinct reptiles, such as the Ichthyosnurus,
whose ribs are throughout attached to the centra, afford still more striking
 instances of the confusion which would be produced by taking the neuro
 central suture as a morphological boundary.
    Miiller has argued that it is a distinctive character of <U+FB01>shes to have the
 ribs attached to the centra of the vertebrae or to parapophyses, and his
 views have been adopted by other anatomists; but the ribs of the
 Ichthyosaurus and of the Echidna are as completely and solely attached to
 their centra as those of any <U+FB01>sh; so that if we merely take the facts
 furnished by anatomy, the doctrine that there is anything peculiarly
 piscine in the attachment of the ribs to the centra only, falls to the
 ground.
    But it may be urged that the connexion of the head of the rib with the
 centnmi, in mammals and the higher Vertebrata, is secondary, that with
  the diapophysis being the primary and essential one.          This is a very

                                          454
widely current doctrine, and it is sanctioned by Rathke, as we have seen
in the passages quoted above, though they are not quite consistent with
one another.                                            I
               It is with great hesitation that venture to contravene the
distinct statements of so eminent and accurate an embryologist as Rathke,
but my own observations lead me to precisely the opposite conclusions.
   In the spinal column of embryos of the mouse 7-8ths of an inch long,
              I
for instance, find that the posterior dorsal vertebrae (A. fig. 10) have no
diapophyses, and that the ribs have no tubercles, but that their heads pass
directly into the cartilaginous substance of the centrum.         Further forwards
(B, C)   both diapophysis   and tubercle    become more and more developed,
until at length they come into contact and articulate in the ordinary
way.   Finally, in the cervical region (D) the rib and the diapophysis are,
even in this early stage, confluent.

    VII.—I subjoin the views of Vogt, and the criticisms of the late great
anatomist Johannes Miiller upon them, as the best means of exhibiting
their relation to those have advocated.

    “Ifwe ask ourselves what we mean by vertebrae, the primary segments
 of the still indi<U+FB02>erent tissue round the chorda, which arise in all vertebrate
embryos, are the <U+FB01>rst things‘ to suggest themselves.           These persist only in
the lowest grades of vertebrate animals, while in the higher they disap
pear, in consequence of the more and more complete development of
 secondary organs, especially of the extremities; so far as we are able to
 trace these segments, so far          is
                                      there    formation of vertebrae.
                                                    a
    “But there      at once
                   is          di<U+FB02>iculty,
                                 a         when    we endeavour to <U+FB01>nd these seg
 ments   in  the rudiment   of  the  skull of  any vertebrate embryo.       It true      is
 that many     in<U+FB02>exions   may   be  observed    which   appear  to correspond with
 such vertebrae, but unfortunately these do not appear in the same places in
 different embryos; and besides, these in<U+FB02>exions and curvatures of the base
 of the skull are not in the least similar to the sharply and clearly de<U+FB01>ned
 intervals between the primary vertebrae. The <U+FB01>rst of these intervals                          is
 always formed behind the auditory vesicles, and lies therefore between
 the occiput and the <U+FB01>rst cervical vertebra; further forwards, as has been
 said, no such interval         discoverable.
                                 is                But in the Oyclostome <U+FB01>shes,
 which represent this embryonic condition, no vertebral divisions of the
 skull are discernible   ; in fact we have in the Myxinoids, only the chorda
 with   its  sheath  and  muscular    and cutaneous vertebral rings, which are
 repeated up to    the skull,  but  there   cease.   The skull of the Myxinoids,
 like that of the higher cartilaginous <U+FB01>shes, cannot by any amount of
 violence be forced under the vertebrate type.              In the skull, then, the

                                       456
primary vertebral segments are wanting. However, they might be oblite
rated by the early development of the organs of sense, or by the aberrant
 development of the brain.
    “But there remains a second means of discovering the cranial vertebrae,
by examining the solid cartilaginous and bony basis of the skull; though
here also we meet with insuperable di<U+FB01>iculties.       As the primitive type of
 the more solid bodies of the vertebrae, we have everywhere cartilaginous
rings arising out of the sheath of the chorda, and deposited around its
nucleus.    Whether they arise as lateral halves or as entire rings, whether
they embrace the chorda completely or only above or below, is a matter
of no essential moment.        But are such cartilaginous rings deposited
around the chorda, discoverable in the skull?         They will be sought for
in vain unless it be in the last, occipital, cranial vertebra; in this we
still <U+FB01>nd all the characters of a vertebra—the investment of the chorda,
the chondri<U+FB01>cation in the sheath of the chorda.        But the chorda does not
pass into the so-called <U+FB01>rst and second cranial vertebrae; it invariably ends,
as Rathke justly states, between the auditory capsules, and never passes
into the body of the second cranial vertebra, let alone that of the <U+FB01>rst.
The lateral cranial trabeculm, which bear the two anterior cranial ver
tebrse, can by no possibility be regarded as centra of vertebrae, since in
this case, the characteristic feature, the being traversed by the chorda,
is entirely absent. Again, these lateral trabeculae are continued uninter
ruptedly forwards, below the <U+FB01>rst division of the brain, showing no trace
of a median division. But in what part of the vertebral column has it
ever been seen that two vertebrae arise united and afterwards divide ?
   “ It has therefore become my distinct persuasion that the occipital
vertebra is indeed a true vertebra, but that everything which lies before
it is not fashioned upon the vertebrate type at all, and that all efforts to
interpret it in such a way are vain; that therefore, if we except that ver
tebra (occipital), which ends the spinal column anteriorly, there are no
cranial vertebrae at all.”—Vogt, Entw. d. Geburtshelferkriite, pp. 98-100.
   “Vogt, and in the present work Agassiz also, contest the justice of
the theory of the composition of the skull of several vertebrae, and will
only admit an occipital vertebra, because the embryonic chorda., accord
ing to Vogt’s investigations, extends no further in the skulls of <U+FB01>shes and
Amphibia.     In this, in my opinion, too much stress is laid upon a single
result of embryological investigation.       That, however, the chorda in the
frog’s larva extends beyond the base of the occiput, further than where
                                                            I
the slight trace of the basioccipital is ultimately formed, have myself seen.
Even the anterior part of the vertebral column of the Rays shows that the
chordal system, out of which, according to my own and Vogt’s observa
tions, only the central part of the <U+FB01>shes’ vertebra proceeds, may be abortive,
whilst the cortical part of the vertebra, which arises in quite a dilferent
way, is at its maximum of development.         In a longitudinal section of the
anterior part of the vertebral column of a Ray, it is seen that the central
parts of the vertebrae, in the axis of the vertebral column, or those parts
which are developed from the chordal sheath alone, become <U+FB01>ner and <U+FB01>ner
anteriorly (although the column still exhibits vertebral divisions), and

                                      457
at last  cease entirely, without reaching the anterior end of the vertebral
column.      On the other hand, Branchiostoma lubricum shows us the op
posite extreme ; the chords passes beyond the anterior end of the skull,
beyond the mouth and the eyes, far into the extremest end of the snout.
   “ This remarkable fact, <U+FB01>rst observed by Sundevall, was very surprising
to me, since in consequence of my studies up till that time, I regarded
the existence of three vertebrae in the proper cerebral cranium as certain,
at least I considered the assumption of a fourth ethmoidal vertebra to be
uncertain and undemonstrated.
                 I
   “For now saw at once, that it was undoubtedly possible that the
cephalic vertebral column might extend further forwards. There need not
always be three cranial vertebrae developed in the head; in birds, reptiles,
and <U+FB01>shes, the most anterior vertebra is abortive, and is even entirely
wanting in some families; but, in the Mammalia and man, three cranial
vertebrae are without exception discoverable in the basis crauii, either in
the foetus, or in many cases even in young or middle-aged animals—the
occipitale basilare, sphenoideum basilare, posterius and anterius; these also
occur in <U+FB01>sh.      How far the chords primitively extends in Mammalia is
not yet made out; but even although it should not reach through the
whole basis cranii, this, from the reasons which have been stated, would
be no good argument.”—J oh. Miiller, Bericht. cclxviii-ix., Miiller’s

Dublin, in August 1857, a resolution was adopted, proposing the
continuance of the system of magnetical observations which was
commenced under the auspices of the Royal              Society, and of the
British Association, in 1840; and         a Committee,    consisting of the
President     of the Association, the Rev. Dr. Robinson,         and Major
General Sabine, was appointed, to request the cooperation of the
President and Council of the Royal Society in the endeavour to
attain this object, and to take,    -in conjunction with them, such steps
as may appear desirable for that end.

   The Committee thus appointed accordingly held a meeting in Lon
don, on the 5th of November last, at which it was agreed to recom

                                   458
mend that hourly observations, for not more than five years, should
be undertaken at certain stations in the British Colonies;        and   a
letter was addressed to the President       of the Royal Society, asking
for his cooperation, and that of the Council of the Society, in en
deavouring to attain that object.
   This application was favourably received by the Council of the
Royal Society; and on the 10th of December, 1857, the following
resolution was adopted in reference to    it:—
    “That Sir John     Herschel,  the Astronomer     Royal, the Dean of
Ely, and Dr. Whewell,     be appointed a Committee, to cooperate with
the Committee      appointed with this view by the British Association,
and to take, in conjunction with them, such steps as may be neces
sary, including, if it be thought desirable, an application to Govern
ment.”
    In consequence    of this resolution, a correspondence took place
among the members       of the two Committees, which having resulted,
it is believed, in a general agreement   as to the course to be adopted,
the joint Committee     so acting in cooperation met at Leeds on the
24th of September, and in the first instance proceeded to inquire
into the nature and scientific value of the results which have already
been secured by the system of observation hitherto carried out, at the
observatories maintained     by the Government, at the joint recom
mendation     of these two bodies, with a    view  to forming a distinct
opinion whether they are such as to merit being regarded as a reason
able, and, what may be called, a remunerative return for the labour
and thought      bestowed upon them, and the very considerable       ex
penditure of the public money incurred by them. In so doing, they
have limited their views to the results, as compared with the ex
penditure, in the British Colonial Magnetic Observatories only, with.
out taking into consideration those deducible from observations made
under foreign auspices; and they find that, at the cost of an ex
penditure which may be reckoned at about £400 per annum (ex
clusive of the cost of instruments, outfit, and publication) for each
of the several observatories at St. Helena, Toronto, Hobarton, and
the Cape    of Good Hope during the respective continuance of each,
                                          :
the accumulated observations, so far as they have yet been discussed,
have produced the following results, which they consider as satis
factorily established by the discussion

                                        459
   In   the <U+FB01>rst place, the mean state of the several magnetic elements
for each of the stations,    as reduced to   a  <U+FB01>xed epoch, has been obtained
with   a precision   of which nothing previously        done has afforded any
example—-emulating, in this respect,           the exactness    of astronomical
determinations, and competent to serve as a <U+FB01>xed point of departure
to the latest ages; and this for each of the elements             in question
the dip, the declination, and the intensity of the magnetic force.
    Secondly, that at each station, the rate of regularly            progressive
secular change in all the three elements            above mentioned has been
ascertained with a degree of precision which contrasts strongly with
the loose and inaccurate determinations of former times.
    Thirdly, that the laws of the diurnal, annual, and other periodic
<U+FB02>uctuations in the values of these elements, as exhibited at each sta
tion, have been established in       a manner and with a decision to which
nothing     hitherto executed     in any branch of      science, astronomy ex
cepted, is comparable;        and that the results embodied in the exa
mination of these laws have laid open            a view  of magnetic action   so
singular, and so utterly unexpected, as to amount to the creation of
a new    department of science, and the detection of a completely novel
system of physical relations       : for that, in the <U+FB01>rst place, the systems
 of diurnal and annual magnetic changes              have each   been separated
into two perfectly distinct and physically independent systems,—the
 one, at any particular station, holding its course according to laws
 depending solely on the sun’s hour-angle at the moment of observa
tion, and his meridian altitude at different seasons,—-the          other, com
 prehending all those movements which, under the name of magnetic
 stems, or “irregular disturbances,” have hitherto presented the
perplexing aspect of phenomena purely casual, capricious in amount
 and in the particular      occasions    of their occurrence when regarded
 singly, has been shown, by these discussions, to be subject in its
 totality to laws equally de<U+FB01>nite with the others, though more depend
 ent for their application on peculiarities of local situation. As regards
 the <U+FB01>rst of these systems of <U+FB02>uctuation, they <U+FB01>nd it demonstrated           :—
    That the    sun’s regular action on the magnetism           of the globe is
 determined by a law of no small complexity and intricacy, but which,
 nevertheless,   has been traced with precision and certainty, and shown
 to be referable,   in the <U+FB01>rst    place, and   for one of its arbitrary coe<U+FB01>i
 cients, to the geographical situation of the place of observation with

                                                       460
respect to a certain line or equator on the earth's surface, which                                               can
not yet be precisely traced for want of sufficiently numerous stations
(but which          to approach to the line of least intensity, and is
                    seems
very far from coinciding with the geographical equator),—and in the
next, and for its other influential cause, to the fact of the sun’s
having north or south declination; so that the whole diurnal change
in any one of the elements, and at any station, is made up of two
portions,     one     of which retains the                    same      sign, and a constant                        co
efficient     all
           the year round; the other changes sign, and varies                                                        in
the value of its coefficient with the annual movement of the sun
from one side         of   the equator            to   the other.
  That, consequently, for                     station         on   the magnetic equator (so                         de
fined), the mean amount                    of a   diurnal change             is   nil, when taken over
the whole year, but that                    on    any particular         day      in      the year        it   has   a
determinate magnitude, which passes through                                       an   annual periodicity,
with opposite characters               in    opposite seasons.      And that for station                  a
in   middle latitudes the mean                    diurnal fluctuation   not nil, but such
                                                                                   is
as   during every part            of   the year          to   exhibit        an   easterly deviation                 in
the morning hours, and                 a   westerly         in   the evening hours, for stations
north   of    the magnetic equator, and vice versá for those south                                             of   it;
but that the amount               of   this deviation,            or   the amplitude             of   the diurnal
fluctuation,        varies with        the seasons,              being exaggerated                    or   partially
counteracted          by    the alternate conspiring                    and opposing influence                       of
the sun’s declination during the summer and winter seasons.
     As regards the irregular disturbances, though arbitrary and capri
cious   in   extent and       in   the moments when they may                                    be   expected,      in
dividually,         they nevertheless obey, with great fidelity, the law                                             of
averages      when grouped             in   masses, and treated separately from those
of                                So handled they are found                                                 in   their
                                                                                       of to
     the former class.                                                                         conform
average effect,        at   each      of   the twenty-four              hours                  the day, and on
each    day    of    the year,        to   the very same rules                    as     regards the sun’s
daily and annual movement, with one remarkable point   difference,                                   of
viz. that their hours of maxima and minima are not identical with
those   of    the regular class, but that each particular                                       station has,         in
this respect,        its   own peculiar hours, analogous                          to    what         is   called the
“establishment”              of   a   port    in   the theory           of   the tides.              And that        in
consequence, the superposition                         of   these two systems                   of   diurnal     fluc
tuation gives rise           toa   series         of   compound variations analogous                           to   the

                                      461
superposition of two undulations having the same period but di<U+FB02>'erent
amplitudes, and different epochal times;          and that by attending to
this principle, many of the most complex phenomena,           such as that of
a double maximum and minimum, with the occurrence of                a nightly
as well as a daily movement,     are explained in a satisfactory manner.
   The discussion of the observations already accumulated has further
brought into view, and in the opinion of your Committee fully esta
blished, the existence  of a very extraordinary periodicity in the extent
of <U+FB02>uctuation of all the magnetic      elements,  and in the amplitude and
frequency of their irregular     movements       especially, which connects
them directly with the physical constitution of the sun, and with the
periodical greater or less prevalence of spots on its surt'ace—the
maxima    of the amount of <U+FB02>uctuation corresponding to the maxima
of the spots, and these again with those of the exhibitions of the
Aurora Borealis, which appears       also to be subject to the same law     of
periodicity; a law, which as it does not agree with any of the other
wise known solar, lunar, or planetary periods, may be considered as,
so to speak, personal to the sun itself.       And thus    we <U+FB01>nd ourselves
landed in  a system   of cosmical relations, in which both the sun and
the earth, and probably the whole planetary system, are implicated.
   That the   sun acts in in<U+FB02>uencing       the earth’s magnetism in some
other manner than by its heat, seems to be rendered very probable
by several features of this inquiry, and the idea of       a direct magnetic
in<U+FB02>uence exterior to the earth, is corroborated by the discovery of          a
minute <U+FB02>uctuation in the magnetic elements,           having for its period
not the solar but the lunar day, and therefore directly traceable           to
the action of the moon.        The detection of this <U+FB02>uctuation by M.
Kreil, from   a discussion of the Prague observations, has been con
<U+FB01>rmed by the evidence afforded by those of our Colonial observatories,
and appears to be placed beyond all question by the recent deductions
for the horizontal force and the declination extending over three years
of observation  at the Cape   of Good Hope, which        Genera]   Sabine has
submitted for your Committee’s inspection, and in both which the
<U+FB02>uctuations in question emerge in         a  very satisfactory manner, and
one calculated to give a high       idea   of the precision of which such
determinations are susceptible, when it is considered that the total
amplitude of oscillation due to this cause in the direction of the Cape
needle is only about 16"    of angle.

                                     462
    Your Committee, looking at this long catalogue of distinct and
 positive conclusions already obtained, feel themselves fully borne out
 in considering    that the operation in a scienti<U+FB01>c point of view has
 proved so far eminently       remunerative and successful, and that its
 results have fully equalled in importance and value, as real accessions
 to our knowledge,      any anticipations    which   could reasonably have
 been formed at the commencement         of the inquiry.
    Having satis<U+FB01>ed themselves of the great and important value of the
 results already obtained, independent of the dormant interest as
 respects future discussion which the mass     of observations accumulated
 continues to possess, and which it remains for future theoretical com
 binations to elicit,-—your    Committee next turned their attention to
 the question, whether and to what extent the maintenance of some
 or all of the old Colonial    observatories, or the establishment of new
ones   for a limited  term might    be expected,—<U+FB01>rst      to give additional
certainty and precision to the determinations already obtained,—and
secondly, to elucidate points imperfectly made out, and more espe
cially geographical     relations which    determine    the greater or less
amount of discordance between the epochal hours of the regular and
irregular   diurnal   changes—relations     which    no doubt involve     the
causes   of the irregular <U+FB02>uctuations themselves (causes at present
involved in the greatest obscurity),—and to obtain indications of the
points in the earth’s surface at which the forces producing them
originate.
   As regards the general question as to the desirableness of some
continuation of the observations, it seems hardly to be referred to
our consideration as a Committee-the          resolutions came to both by
the British Association and by the Council of the Royal Society, in
the appointment      of their respective Committees of cooperation, in
dicating an    opinion already conclusively formed on the part of both
bodies to that effect.    They   have felt it due to themselves, however,
to come to an independent conclusion on that point, and having done
so  with perfect unanimity, on the grounds already adduced, and the
expectations for the future which       those grounds justify, they next
address themselves     to the consideration of the two points above in
dicated, and to the important questions—<U+FB01>rst,        whether to recommend
the continuance or resumption       of the establishments     at the former

                                     4-63
stations, or the selection of new ones;       and secondly, with how      few
new or revived establishments, with how limited a scale as to extent
and expense, and with how short a period as to the minimum               term
of their duration, the expectation of      these advantages being secured
could    be  compatible,   and <U+FB01>nally to      <U+FB01>x  upon the stations most
desirable.
    As regards the <U+FB01>rst point referred to, viz. the more complete
establishment      of the laws themselves, and the giving of greater
numerical precision to their expression, the Committee are of opinion
that the laws themselves are not likely to be subverted or contra
dicted by a larger series of observations at any station for which they
have once been shown to prevail    ;  but that every new station differing
much in geographical situation from the former, in which they might
be found veri<U+FB01>ed, with or without supplementary modi<U+FB01>cations, would
undoubtedly      add strength to the induction by which they have been
concluded.     Additional numerical precision on the other hand would
only be   attained by a continuance of observations at former stations,
and is not a point of sufficient importance, in their opinion, to be en
titled to any weight in opposition to considerations in favour of
change,-while in the one important case in which such additional
precision is especially desirable,—that    of the solar period,—such addi
tional precision will be acquired ultimately as a matter of course by
continued observation at any one of the existing permanent observa
tories, of whose business magnetic observation forms          a  part as well
as  by any amount of Colonial establishments.
    It is therefore mainly in the elucidation of obscure and di<U+FB01>icult
physical points, and in the probable extension of our knowledge of
the geographical      and other conditions    on which    the irregular   dis
turbances depend, that our hope of advantage from further observa
tion consists   ; our conviction being that, without special observations
at well-selected stations (selected, that is, with a view  to these objects),
there is little or no prospect of further progress.        The general   cha
racter of the magnetic phenomena may         be considered as secured   from
loss  ; but the great problem remains unresolved,—the        local in<U+FB02>uences
are yet to trace, and the only means      of tracing them must consist in
varying the position of our stations, so as to embrace great dilferences
in geographical situation, and in conformity with such indications as
can be gathered       from our present experience.      The magnetic    esta
                                                               212

                                       464
blishments permanently existing          in Europe    and America      are  con
fessedly inadequate to afford the requisite information.          The stations
which have occurred to your Committee as most eligible, would be,
Vancouver       Island,   Newfoundland,      the  Falkland Isles,    Bermuda,
Ceylon, Shanghai or some locality in China, and Mauritius; but they
are   fully  aware that to demand from the national purse the institution
 of observations     at all these points, would    be more than is warranted
 by any pressing necessity,      and ought therefore not to be insisted on.
 Among       them, the principal   in point of interest (for reasons which
 will be presently mentioned), are Vancouver Island, Newfoundland,
 the Falkland Isles, and Pekin or some near adjacent Chinese station             ;
 and the Committee consider that much valuable information                 would
 accrue from observations su<U+FB01>iciently          prolonged   at these,  to which,
 therefore, they would be understood to limit their recommendation.
 In regard to the length of time over which they would             desire to see
 the observations extended, they consider <U+FB01>ve years (being about half
 the solar period, and as being also su<U+FB02>icient to give a fair grasp of the
 secular change of the magnetic elements) as a period both in con
 sonance with that which has been accorded on former occasions, and
 in some sort designated by the nature of the case.
     The    reasons which induce them to give a preference to these over
 the rest of the stations enumerated are as follows :—Between Toronto
  and  Point Barrow the difference of      the epochal hours    of the irregular
  diurnal <U+FB02>uctuations is such as to amount to a complete opposition            of
  phases,    a circumstance which goes far to point out the latter station
  as being    in the immediate neighbourhood of the origin of           those  ir
  regular disturbances.       Should observations be established at the two
  stations now proposed, there is every reason to hope, as will appear
  from a document drawn up at the request of the Committee                    by
  General Sabine, and with his permission appended to this Report,
  that the observations at Toronto, which have been partially re-esta
  blished since l855, would, with a view to cooperation for this especial
  purpose, be wholly resumed on a <U+FB01>tting           application  to the Colonial
  legislature.     And, in addition   to this, should an application, made to
  the Norwegian Government          for the establishment, during the same
  period, of an observatory at the North Cape prove, successful (which
  there is every reason to hope, such an application made on a former
   occasion having been well received,     and having ultimately failed owing
                                             0

                                        465
only to a want of attention to some point of diplomatic             form in its
mode   of communication),       we should then have a chain       of stations in
high northern latitudes, the results obtained at which being severally
brought    into comparison with those already procured at Point Bar
row, and with each other, could hardly fail of bringing out some very
positive conclusion.
   As regards the proposal for         a station at the   Falkland Isles, it is
presumed, from the general course of the magnetic line of minimum
intensity, that this station will prove, in analogy to the Cape of Good
Hope, and in contrast with the northern            stations recommended, to
have the character    of an equatorial, or approximate equatorial, station;
and in respect to that proposed in China, that it will complete and
carry round the globe the chain of northern middle latitude stations,
—the intermediate links being supplied by the Russian observatories,
and by those which it is hoped may be established at the North
Cape and at Toronto. As regards the Falkland Isles and Newfound
land,  it should   be noticed that there exist considerable facilities and
conveniences for      the comfortable      establishment   of  an observatory
there; and in    respect  of the other two, it may    be remarked, that they
are both points of great present interest, and that a determination of
the meteorological as well as magnetic peculiarities of both would be
important.      The  a<U+FB02>'ections   of a telegraphic wire by electric discharges
in the nature of Aurora Borealis have already attracted attention, and
produced confusion in the ordinary use of such wires, and constitute
one  of the motives for inquiry into the nature and laws of the              so
called magnetic storms.         It  may also be observed that, in reference
to the anomalistic equation of the sun’s magnetic intensity, or the
eifect  of its annual approach and        recess due to the  ellipticity of the
earth’s orbit, the in<U+FB02>uence of local temperature upon the observations
requires to be eliminated, in order to bring this effect         into evidence,
by a combination      of the results obtained      at stations whose seasons
are opposite.
   In reference to the important consideration of keeping down                as
much as possible the outlay consequent on the establishment of these
observatories, your Committee          have given attention to the question
whether it be desirable to continue, as heretofore, the printing of the
observations in ea:temo—-a measure resulting in the production of vast
and costly volumes, and entailing a great amount of laborious super

                                     466
intendence.      They consider that the form of the observations re
maining unaltered, and the principles of their reduction being now
rendered familiar, this would not be necessary,        provided the original
observations were registered in triplicate,      and the copies      separately
deposited in different and secure custody for preservation and occa
sional reference when required, and provided that su<U+FB01>icient and well
digested   abstracts of their reduced results were published.        One series
of observations, however, they consider must be excepted from this
alteration of system,-those of a continuous nature, made on tenn
 days, FOUR of which per annum they desire to            see still kept up,—
and those taken on occasions of magnetic storms, when continuous
observation is substituted for that on the regular hourly intervals            ;
for the treatment of such observations is still        a   matter of scienti<U+FB01>c
inquiry;    and to render them‘ available, in comparison with others,
the complete register is indispensable.
    Your Committee cannot but contemplate         a revival  of active interest
and    cooperative participation   in the system of observation on the
part of our Colonial and of Foreign Governments, when once it shall
become known that the subject is resumed by our own Home Govern
ment in the manner recommended. On this subject they beg to refer
to General Sabine’s reply to their inquiries, already alluded to, which
places in a distinct point of view the expectations which may justly
be indulged on that score.       In  reference,  moreover, to the personal
and material establishment at each of the Government observatories,
this document contains      a  summary of what is needed, and of what
ought to be applied for.
    And this   leads your Committee to a point which         they consider of
such importance to the success of the whole proceeding, that they
cannot help embodying their opinion on it in this Report.              It is of
little avail to accumulate observations unless their effective and com
plete reduction be provided for, and the assurance obtained that when
reduced they will undergo such discussion and scienti<U+FB01>c treatment as
shall elicit from them the laws of the phenomena of which they are
the records.      The zeal and ability with which      the present Superin
tendent of the Government         Magnetic    and Meteorological      Observa
tories has hitherto executed this task,      if extended to the new series
now called for, would afford that assurance           in its fullest extent;
and they earnestly trust that this will not be lost sight of in the

                                      467
arrangements      to be   made     in   carrying    out   their   proposals,  if
adopted.
   There is another point to which your Committee consider their
attention ought to be paid simultaneously with the establishment of
the proposed observatories:      it is that of the extension of Magnetic
Surveys of the districts     in their immediate neighbourhood,          with a
view to <U+FB01>xing the situation and direction of the iso-magnetic curves
within   some considerable adjoining area      (in the  case of the Falkland
Isles-—that of the whole group).
   On this point the following remarks by General Sabine, in a com
munication addressed by him to us in reply to certain inquiries which
we considered    it right  to make    of him,   are  in the opinion of your
Committee, conclusive in deciding them to recommend that provision
be also made    for the execution of such surveys, collaterally with the
observations at the fixed stations.
   “ Recent observations in North America, discussed in the ‘ Proceed
ings of the Royal Society’ for January 7th, 1858, have made known
that the general movement of translation of the isoclinal and isogonic
lines, which from the earliest observations have been progressing from
west to east, has within a few years reached its extreme eastern
oscillation, and that the movement in the reverse direction has already
commenced     ; we live therefore at an epoch       in the history of terres
trial magnetism, which      we have    reason   to believe will be regarded
hereafter——when      theory shall have more advanced—as a highly im
portant and critical epoch.      The geographical position of the maxi
mum force in the Northern Hemisphere appears to have reached its
extreme easterly elongation, and from this time forth may be expected
to move for many years to come towards the meridian which it occu
pied in Halley’s time, accompanied by a corresponding change in the
positions and forms of the isodynamic, isoclinal, and isogonic line
in North America:       a careful   determination     of the absolute values
and present secular change of the three elements at this critical theo
retical epoch, at stations situated on either side of the American con
tinent,   and nearly in the geographical latitude of the maximum             of
the force, would furnish therefore data for posterity, of the value of
which we may have a very inadequate appreciation                at present.   I
may refer to the discussion pre<U+FB01>xed to the third volume of the To
ronto Observations, to show that the means and methods with which

                                      4-68
we are conversant are adequate       for the purpose      ;  and  I may indicate
Vancouver Island and Newfoundland            as colonies well-suited      for esta
blishments of the same nature as those of which                the efficiency has
been~proved.”
   As regards the instrumental          means   to be employed, the Com
mittee believe that the consideration        of the subject would        be more
<U+FB01>tly undertaken by the Royal Society, who will probably think it
right to appoint     a special Committee,       as was      done  on the former
occasion, to consider it maturely, and to report upon it.              Well   as in
general the instruments       employed in the British Colonial              Obser
vatories have performed,       it may     be desirable to consider whether
they could not be improved, by diminishing             considerably the size of
the magnetic bars employed.            Small   bars   indicate more certainly
the rapid magnetic changes;        they may be hardened more perfectly,
and therefore vary less    in their magnetic condition with changes of
temperature;    they admit of more perfect protection from the effects
of disturbing aerial currents;       and,   <U+FB01>nally, the instruments may be
constructed   at less expense,      and may be grouped             together in a
smaller and less costly building.
    The joint Committee therefore         have <U+FB01>nally agreed to the follow
ing resolutions, which      they submit for approval to their respective
appointing bodies    :—
    1. That it is highly desirable that      a series   of Magnetical     and  Me
teorological observations, on the same plan as those which have been
already carried on in the Colonial          Observatories      for that purpose,
under the direction of Her Majesty’s Board of Ordnance, be obtained,
to extend over   a  period of not more than <U+FB01>ve years, at the following
stations z—
                 1.  Vancouver Island.
                 2. Newfoundland.
                 3.  The Falkland Isles.
                 4. Pekin, or some near adjacent station.
    2. That an application be made to        Her Majesty’s Government, to
obtain the establishment of observatories at these stations for the
above-mentioned      term,   on  a   personal    and material footing,         and
under the same superintendence as in the observatories (now discon
tinued) at Toronto, St. Helena, and Van Diemen Island.
    3. That the observations at the observatories now recommended,

                                     469
should be comparable with, and in continuation of, those made at the
last-named observatories, including       four days of term observations
annually.
    4. That provision be also requested at the hands of Her Majesty's
 Government,      for the execution, within the period embraced by the
observations,     of magnetic surveys in the districts immediately ad
jacent to those stations, viz. of the whole of Vancouver Island and
the shores of the strait separating it from the main land,—of the
 Falkland Isles,—and of the immediate neighbourhood of the Chinese
 observatory    (if practicable), wherever situated,—on the plan of the
 surveys already executed in the British possessions       in North Ame
 rica, and in the Indian Archipelago.
     5. That   a sum   of £350 per annum, during the continuance of the
 observations,    be recommended to be placed by Government         at the
 disposal of the General Superintendent,      for the purpose of procuring
 a special and scienti<U+FB01>c veri<U+FB01>cation and exact correspondence       of the
 magnetical     and meteorological   instruments,    both  of those which
 shall be furnished to the several    observatories, and of those which,
 during the continuance of the observations for the period in question,
 shall be brought into comparison with them, either at Foreign           or
 Colonial stations.
     6. That the printing of the observations in eztenao        be discon
 tinued,    but that provision be made      for their printing in abstract,
 with discussion;      but that the term observations, and those to be
 made on the occurrence of magnetic storms, be still printed in ex
 tenso;    and that the registry of the observations be made        in tri
 plicate, one copy to be preserved in the o<U+FB02>ice of the General Super
 intendent,    one   to be presented to the Royal Society, and one to
 the Royal Observatory        at Greenwich,   for conservation and future
 reference.
     7.  That   measures   be adopted for taking    advantage of whatever
 disposition may exist on the part of our Colonial Governments,          to
 establish observatories of the same kind, or otherwise to cooperate
  with the proposed system of observation.
     8. That in placing these resolutions and the Report of the Com
  mittee before the President     and Council of the Royal Society, the
  continued    cooperation   of that Society    be  requested in whatever
  ulterior measures may be requisite.

                                      470
    9.  That the President of the British Association        be requested     to
act in conjunction with the President of the Royal Society, and with
the Members of the two Committees, in any steps which may appear
necessary   for the accomplishment of the objects above stated.
    10.  That an early communication be made of this procedure to
 His Royal Highness The Prince Consort, the President              elect of the
 British Association for the ensuing year.
                                  Appendix.
             Letter from General Sabine      to the Committee.
                                                St. Leonard's, June 26, 1858.
    MY DEAR Sm,~—Y0u wish            me to state for the consideration        of
 the Committee, what speci<U+FB01>c measures         for the continuance and ex
 tension of magnetical researches appear to me suitable to the present
 state  of that branch of    science,  and at the same time sn<U+FB02>iciently
moderate and reasonable to justify the expectation that the portion
of them which requires it may       receive the sanction    of Her Majesty’s
 Government.
    For this purpose it may     be convenient to divide the subject gene
 rally under three    heads,   and to consider separately what may be
 expected,-—
                    lst.  From our own Government.
                    2nd. From our own Colonies.
                    3rd. From foreign Countries.
    lst. From our own Government.
    The establishment, for     a limited   period, of observatories in the
three colonies,—
                         Vancouver Island,
                         Newfoundland,
                         The Falkland Islands,
on a similar plan to those which were established at Toronto,                St.
Helena, and Hobarton,      and which have now ceased, having accom
plished their objects.    The “ personnel” at each of these three ob
servatories to consist of an o<U+FB02>icer, four non-commissioned o<U+FB02>ioers,
and one private, either of the Artillery or of the Engineers, with the
same extra pay and allowance for incidentals          as was the case    in the
observatories which have terminated.         The instruments, both        abso
lute and dilferential, to be of the same description as before, with of

                                      471
 course such modi<U+FB01>cations       and improvements        as experience has sug
 gested.    The instruments to     be prepared at      Kew, and the directors
 of the three observatories to      be instructed     there.    The system of
 observation to be hourly     ; Sundays,    Christmas days, and Good        Fri
 days excepted.       The time to  be employed      to be mean astronomical
 time at the station, both for magnetism and meteorology.               The ob
 servatories to be maintained until <U+FB01>ve complete years of observation
 are obtained.       The number of term-days in each year to         be reduced
 from twelve to four.
     The public departments whose sanction will be required, are, the
 Treasury for the expense, and the General Commanding in Chief for
 the selection and appointment      of the of<U+FB01>cers and non-commissioned
 o<U+FB01>icers.     In addition to the o<U+FB02>ioer for      each observatory,     a fourth
 officer will be required as an assistant to the General Superintendent,
 in carrying     on,  under his direction,   the details of correspondence
 with the observatories.        Total, four officers, twelve non-commis
 sioned officers, and three privates.
     2nd.  With reference to our own Colonies.
     As soon as the sanction of Government has           been obtained for the
 observatories already named, the Governors of British Guiana, Mau
 ritius, and Melbourne      may be written      to, suggesting     that a com
 munication     should be addressed from each of those colonies to the
‘Secretary of State for the Colonies, expressing the desire which is
 felt in the colony to participate in the proposed systematic researches,
 stating what facilities   can be a<U+FB02>brded, and what portion          of the  ex
 pense can be borne by the colony itself, and requesting to be placed
 in o<U+FB02>icial     communication    with   some    suitable    authority   for the
 preparation of instruments,     and for furnishing such instructions and
 advice as may be required.
     The accompanying letter from Lieutenant Governor Walker, of
  British Guiana, to M. Sandeman (which has been just forwarded to
 me), will show how ready that colony is to take its part, and that it
 waits only for that measure of countenance and encouragement which
 it reasonably expects, and ought to receive, from the mother country.
  At Mauritius, a Meteorological Society, formed by the colonists
  themselves, is most actively and usefully employed in tracing out, by
  means   of the logs of merchant    vessels, the phenomena      of the storms
  by which navigation in that vicinity is troubled; and is making most

                                      472
pressing appeals     for an authorization     which should enable       them to
add researches     in magnetism to those in meteorology; having on
the spot, in Captain Fyers, of the Royal Engineers, a person who
would make an admirable director of such an establishment.                    At
Melbourne,    a proposition    for a magnetic observatory and survey is
now before the local government;         means    are abundant,     but instru
ments and direction are wanting.            Mr. Jeffery,   so well trained     in
the Hobarton Observatory, is in that country, and is desirous of such
employment,     as  M. Neumayer is of the survey.           Melbourne would
be a most important station for a magnetic observatory, as we might
expect from it the veri<U+FB01>cation or otherwise of the increase               in the
magnetism of the earth, at the period of the year when she makes
her nearest approach to the sun.
   Other colonies might follow the example;            but in regard to these
three, we are justified in expecting that, with suitable measures              of
encouragement, we should have thoroughly                        establishments,
                                                     e<U+FB02>icient
carrying out the system of observation in its completeness.
   3rd.  With reference    to Foreign Countries.
   A  proposition has recently been made to the Netherlands Govern
ment, by Dr. Buys Ballot (who <U+FB01>lls the same o<U+FB01>icial position in
 Holland that Admiral FitzRoy does in this country), for the esta
blishment of a magnetic observatory in the Dutch Colony of Bata
via; and Dr. Buys Ballot has written to inquire whether, in the
event of the proposition being acceded to, two sets of instruments,
one for Batavia     and the other for Utrecht,         could be prepared at
Kew.     An intimation that the British Government               was   about to
resume and extend its magnetical researches,           might be expected to
have a favourable in<U+FB02>uence on the success         of Dr. Buys Ballot’s pro
position, and might also lead to the adoption of our colonial system
of observation in its full extent    at the Batavian observatory.
   The importance of the North Cape of Europe                 as a magnetical
station,  especially with    reference     to the   connexion     between    the
Aurora and the magnetic disturbances, has already been noticed in
a preceding letter from me (that of May 13).                The instruments
which were prepared some years ago at the expense                 of the Royal
Society, and were intended to be presented to the observatory at the
North Cape (should one         be established there by         the  Norwegian
Government), are still in       existence,   and   with a few modi<U+FB01>cations

                                     473
might     be applied  to their original    purpose.   The re-establishment
of magnetic observatories in the British Colonies might furnish              a
favourable occasion for reviving, in concert with M. Hansteen,               a
proposition    for an observatory    at the   North Cape, which     seems to
have failed on the former        occasion rather from an accident than
from any real dif<U+FB01>culty in the matter itself.
     M. Secchi, of the Observatory of the Collegio Romano at Rome,
has recently been supplied from Kew,           at the expense  of the Papal
 Government,     with a complete equipment of magnetical instruments,
 similar to those which      have   done such good work in the British
 Colonial establishments.      With the encouragement derived from the
 revival of active measures here,     M. Secchi might hope to obtain the
 aid which he desires,     in the way of temporary assistance,      to enable
 him to carry out the complete system of observation, for which          he is
 already provided with the instrumental means.
     The concert which has prevailed between Russia and England in
 magnetic operations, gives reason to hope that renewed activity here
 might     so far strengthen   M. Kupffer's hands,     as to enable    him to
 carry out e<U+FB01>iciently the hourly system of the three elements,          at one
  at least of the stations in Eastern Siberia, the probable importance
  of which can scarcely    be overrated.
      A meteorological observatory has recently been instituted at Ha
  vanna, and the director, M. Poey, has proposed to the Cuban autho
  rities the purchase of magnetical instruments, to be prepared at Kew,
  and a su<U+FB01>icient increase of assistants to provide for observations to
  be   made with them.        M. Poey    is active and intelligent,   and has
  recently visited the principal magnetic institutions in Europe.           He
  would not fail to avail himself of the support which his proposition
  would derive from the measures which might be taken here.
      The Regents of the Srriithsonian Institution at Washington have
   agreed to allot a portion of their funds to a magnetic observatory;
   but neither the instruments     nor the system of observation have yet
   been determined:     their decision might probably be hastened by the
   knowledge that active measures are in progress here.
       Viewing the necessity of resorting    to means  of securing and   ascer
   taining a precise correspondence between the magnetical and meteoro
   logical instruments which may come to be used in these operations,
   or in cooperation with them in other quarters, as well as their exact

                                       474
  and scienti<U+FB01>c adjustment, as also of securing          a  seltlregistered series
  of photographic delineations of the solar spots during its continuance
  —it is proposed that during the continuance of the observatories, an
  annual sum, not exceeding £350, should be taken on the estimate,
  and placed at the disposal of the General Superintendent               for these
  purposes.
     There is a point referred to in     a  former letter which will require
  the attention of the Committee.          It   is the question, whether       the
  observations of the proposed observatories should be printed in               em
  tenso,   or in abstract accompanied by         a discussion of the principal
  results.
                  I remain, my dear Sir, faithfully yours,
                                                        EDWARD         SABINE.
     Sir John Herschel, Bart.
                               Parnas anan.
 I. “On      the Changes produced in the proportion                  of the Red
         Corpuscles of the Blood by the administration of Cod
         Liver Oil.”     By THEOPHILUS THOMPSON,                 M.D., F.R.S.
         Received   April 30, 1858.
    In<U+FB02>uenced     by a conviction that the peculiarities essential to any
 disease are often associated   with characteristic changes in the blood,
 and that the e<U+FB02>icacy of many remedies depends on their power of
 modifying such conditions of the blood, I have made it an object to
 take opportunities     of ascertaining some particulars regarding the
 composition of that <U+FB02>uid in certain diseased conditions prior to the
use of remedies, and also in patients affected with similar maladies,
 but whose symptoms under the employment of medicines have been
materially ameliorated.      In  reference    to the inquiry, the proportion
of red corpuscles would appear to       be a circumstance       of special signi
<U+FB01>cance, and to this question      I have directed my chief care.          In pur
suing the investigation,     my attention has been particularly          directed
to cases    of phthisis,  as there was    in this way      a<U+FB01>'orded   to me the
greatest opportunity     of comparing the largest amount of analogous
instances.
    On the 27th of April,   1854,   I had the honour of presenting to the

                                        475
Royal Society a short communication descriptive of the changes pro
duced in the blood by the administration of cod-li_ver oil and cocoa
nut oil, and advanced the conclusion deduced from chemical analysis,
that any favourable result derived from the administration              of these
oils   is associated     with an increase in the proportion         of red   cor
puscles.     Having availed myself of opportunities         for continuing the
investigation,     I beg to present the results to the Society.
   The chief particulars observed are exhibited in a tabular form,
but it may be desirable brie<U+FB02>y to detail the most important cir
cumstances in some of the instances adduced.
    In  two of the patients no oil had been given; both were men, the
subjects of advanced consumption.              In one   of them, Edward D.,
the proportion       of red corpuscles was only 98'20 in 1000 of blood.
In the other, D. D., similarly affected, it was ll9'64.
   When cod-liver oil        was administered,    but failed to produce any
favourable effect on the general condition of the patient, a similar
spareness     in the proportion       of blood-corpuscles was observable.
Thus, for example, James H., a man affected with phthisis in the
third stage, ‘had taken the oil for four months, but notwithstanding
gradually    lost strength and weight.          His proportion of blood-cor
puscles was     ll4'39, still  less than  in D. D.,  a patient to whom no oil
had been administered.
   With    these cases    it is instructive  to contrast others    in the  same
period of disease, to whom cod-liver oil had been administered with
manifest advantage.
   Sarah Warren, aged 26, with a consumptive cavity in each lung,
under a few months’ course of the oil gained            10% pounds in weight,
and in other respects materially improved.             The proportion of cor
puscles was found on analysis to be l45'68.
   In Edwin P.,       aged  28, affected   with a similar condition     of both
lungs, who improved considerably and gained 4 pounds in weight,
under two months’ continuance of the oil treatment, the red cor
puscles existed in nearly the same proportion            as in the female    last
mentioned, being l45'56.
   Thomas      N.,     a  patient  with   a  consumptive     cavity (indicated
amongst other signs by cracked pipkin sound                 on  the left side),
having taken the oil for some months, gained 13 pounds in weight.
The proportion of red discs         was  15778.     It  may be interesting to

                                        476
mention, that in this individual,       the <U+FB01>brine, although considerable in
amount, was not associated        with fat, and that the corpuscles of his
blood examined under the microscope exhibited numerous chains or
rouleaux.
   The results of analysis in       less advanced stages     of  the disease are
still more striking.
   Sarah   M., a  girl aged l6, having the peculiar clicking sound, and
other evidences    of the second stage—that of softening tubercle (on
the left side)—had taken cod-liver oil for six months with most satis
factory results.      The corpuscles were in remarkably high propor
tion, namely l72'56.        It is an interesting fact, that in this instance
the remarkable hum in the jugular veins, often found as a symptom
in anaamia (but as     I think wrongly regarded       as peculiar to that con
dition), was present.
   In Henry B., the subject of phthisis in the           second   stage on both
sides, after a short course    of oil, the proportion     was  14476.
   The highest proportion of corpuscles which            I  have   found in any
of my consumptive patients           was  l74'34.     It  occurred in S. P., a
man aged 36, who had the disease in a very early stage accompanied
with the variety of wavy inspiration, which I believe to indicate the
existence of a considerable amount of freely expanding lung around
the parts consolidated by tubercular deposit.            He had taken oil for
only two months, but had during that period gained about a stone
in weight.
   Another man, Thos. C.,        also in the <U+FB01>rst stage, and with the same
symptom, wavy inspiration,         but with a greater extent of dull per
cussion (and other signs of more disease than S. P.), had also taken
oil for two months with advantage, and the proportion of cor
puscles was l44'45, whilst Thos. B., in whom the physical signs of
disease were   still slighter, but in whose expectoration, examined with
 the microscope, the presence of lung-tissue su<U+FB02>iciently demonstrated
the nature of the disease, the blood contained a proportion of cor
puscles as high as l65'90.         This   man   had taken cod-liver oil (with
only one short interruption)       for twelve months.

to the question under consideration           are  arranged in the following

      The analyses were made                                    by     Mr. Dugald Campbell, Analytical
Chemist                to   the Consumption                          Hospital, and                   were     conducted              as
follows:–
  The blood was placed         small beaker half-full, fitted with
                                                          in   a                                                                     a
cork, and was conveyed carefully          keep the serum free from     so    as   to
the blood-corpuscles.  The beaker containing the blood, after stand
ing twenty-four hours, was weighed.
      The serum, perfectly free from red corpuscles, was drained from the
coagulum with very great care, and the latter being transferred                                                                      on
    to   bibulous paper, after standing for the space                                           of     four      or   five hours,
                                                                                                                             35
was weighed.                       Two        separate         portions          of   coagulum,             of   from        to      40
grains, were again weighed, one for the moisture, and the other for
the fibrine.                The moisture was then entirely removed                                                by     means       of
a    water-oven;                 from          24   to    36   hours being found necessary for accom
    plishing this object, the completion                                    of   which was ascertained                         by   the
    capsule, with                its       contents, ceasing                to            The portion for

    the fibrine was removed into                                a      bason, treated with cold water by
    maceration, until the fibrine appeared                                perfectly colourless, when
                                                                              to      be
it       was removed                  on     to    a   previously weighed filter, again washed, and
    carefully but not too highly dried.                                      The filter and fibrine were next
    put into      a      test-tube, and,                  in   order     to   separate          the fat, digested, first
    with ether and again with alcohol, twice                                      or   thrice, then dried                 by   means

                                    478
represents the <U+FB01>brine; and these data being obtained, the amount of
blood-corpuscles, and that of <U+FB01>brine in l000 parts of the blood, are
determined by a simple calculation.
   The general correspondence      between    the instances adduced      in the
present communication      and those of my former contribution is suffi
ciently obvious;     the proportion    of red corpuscles in patients to
whom oil had been successfully administered exceeding that ascer
tained to exist in the <U+FB01>rst stage of the disease, in those to whom this
medicine had not been given.       It is commonly stated, and the remark
is in harmony with my own observations,              that the proportion      of
red corpuscles is usually less in women than in men.              To this rule
the seventh case in the Table furnishes an exception,               and it was
further remarkable from the fact that         a murmur      could be heard in
the jugular vein; a phenomenon commonly               attributed   to spareness
of blood-corpuscles,    but in this instance associated       with more than
the average amount.
   The   case numbered     thirteen in the tabular analyses would seem
directly opposed to the conclusion to which the other observations
tend, but the patient had suffered from repeated attacks of spitting
of blood    so extreme as to place her life     in jeopardy.      This profuse
heemorrhage would naturally increase the poverty of             the circulating
<U+FB02>uid, and thus counteract to a great extent the apparent in<U+FB02>uence
of the remedy.
    In the fourteenth   case ozonized   oil had  been administered.
   The rapid reproduction of red corpuscles implied in these obser
vations, suggests inquiries of special interest; but I purposely abstain
from any attempt to explain the mode by which it is effected.

       R. M‘DoNNELL, M.D. Communicated by Mr. Bowman.
       Received Oct. 27, 1858.
   DEAR SIR,——In the      course of last winter   I had   the honour, through
your kindness, of making a communication to the Royal Society              “ On
the Power     exercised by the Actiniee     of our Shores in killing their
prey ;” allow    me   now, through    the same medium, to correct the

                                                             479
view which          I
                was at that time led to adopt, that this power is due
to electrical influence.
   In      the communication                       alluded         to, the idea of these                  creatures
being electrical,          was based on the fact, that when the nerve of a frog's
limb, prepared after the manner of Matteucci's galvanoscopic frog,
is seized by the tentacles of                          an actinia, contractions                   of the muscles
promptly          ensue.           It    was admitted, however, that                             all   attempts        to
produce        deflection          of    the galvanometer-needle                      had failed, and this
being      the very doubtful                      state      of    the question,      I     ventured           to   look
forward        to    the pleasure                 of   making another communication                             on   the
subject      when        I    had had further opportunities                                of     examining          the
Actiniae       in   health and vigour.
I       have now had these                         opportunities,           and have found that the
most delicate electrometers are unaffected                                     by   these animals, and                I

  A      galvanoscopic frog's limb having been prepared, with the nerve
as   long    as   possible,        it   is   laid      on a    piece   of   perfectly clear glass,              so   that
the nerve hangs over the edge.                                 The pendent nerve                  is   lowered into
the water containing                    an    Anthea, and the nerve                   is   brought        in   contact
with    a   single one            of   the long tentacles              of   this creature;             immediately
vigorous        contractions             follow           in    the muscles           of     the limb,         and    if
everything           be
              left undisturbed, these twitchings                                             will continue for
some minutes after the nerve   withdrawn.               is
     If,   however,       a       thread          be   tied round the nerve,                     below the point
where the tentacle                      of   the Anthea              had touched           it,   all   twitchings      at
once cease.             If   the portion touched                       by   the tentacle           be   snipped off,
 all   twitchings         also cease.                  Having thus repeatedly observed that
contact between the nerve and                                  a   single tentacle was followed                        by
muscular contractions, which                              at   once ceased   soon  asthe portion   as
of the nerve which had been                                     incontact with the tentacle was
removed,          it     occurred            to   me      to    try the      effect     of       applying       to    the
nerve      a   single tentacle removed from the body                                        of     an   Anthea.       I
therefore had recourse                       to   the following          experiment:—The hind leg
of   a   frog   is   separated from the body, the sciatic nerve dissected out
carefully,          so   that the nerve                be   not crushed       or    injured, and the thigh
cut away.            The limb with the                         nerve   thus dissected out               K      long    as

   round the base of one of the tentacles of an Anthea, and the tentacle
   snipped off.        The     mere tentacle separated               from the animal to which
   it belonged is drawn gently across the                      nerve, or laid upon        it,   at the
   upper part: immediately                 muscular       contractions      follow in the leg.
   These contractions cease at once               if   the portion of the nerve touched
   by    the tentacle be cut 05.             There can,         it   seems, no longer         be any
   doubt      that the        muscular     contractions          are   excited,     not     by   elec
   tricity, but by irritant action of the urticating organs of the Anthea,
   which being more powerful in this respect than other Anemones,
   has been chosen for experiment, although other varieties give similar
   results.
   I      now   see
                  I     was    in error in supposing that the               effect produced on
   the    frogs limb by the Actiniaa could                     be transmitted       along   a    wire.
  I     presume that in preparing                the experiment alluded to, which                  I
   performed      in the open air, at the                  sea-side,     some     of the irritant
   materials     of the Anemones, which                 I       had    possibly     handled, had
   been    brought       by   my <U+FB01>ngers in contact with the nerves, and                     I     was
   thus deceived.
    I     am very happy, however, that                I   am myself the <U+FB01>rst to perceive
   and correct this error.

           Received Oct.         4,   1858.
         In the early part of last spring         I    began to investigate the anatomy
   of this interesting little         insect,     with the intention of studying only
   the organs connected with the development of the ova and pseudova.
   It    soon, however, became evident that the structure                        of the intestinal
   canal, on the one hand, had been entirely misunderstood                                by those
   who had previously examined                  it;   and on the other, that the nervous
   system, far from being similar                 in all specimens, varied in the most
   extraordinary manner.              It   is   therefore proposed in the present com
   munication         to give a very brief description                 of the digestive organs
   and of the nervous system.

  Ramdohr and Leydig are the only two naturalists, so                                            far   as

Alni.
  According               Leydig (Zeitschr.                                    W.   TAB.   I,   fig.    1),

the canal     in   Coccus hesperidum consists                     ofa   short oesophagus,        a   large
stomach, and        a     long intestine.        Into this intestine open four glands.
Rather behind the middle                  of of      are situated the two large, yellow
hepatic glands, and          in   front      it

was long before               I could       convince myself that he had made such a
series    of mistakes.              His descriptions of the                     separate         parts are indeed
correct (though in my specimens the hepatic glands (G,                                                   G) were pro
portionally larger than in his figure), but he has entirely misunder
stood the relations of the different organs.
     The true           oesophagus              (fig.    1   A) is       rather          long      and        extremely
narrow.          It    corresponds,         I believe,           to the tube             f in Leydig's figure,
which he considers as an appendage to the intestine.                                                   Following the
oesophagus comes the pear-shaped bag                                    (fig.   1      F), with        its   remarkable
cellular,       contorted, internal                     gland.          Then there               is    a     very short
intestine (D, ilium) opening into the rectum (C), which Leydig has
described as the stomach.    The rectum      often found filled with          is
fluid,     as   Leydig figures            it,   and varies         in    shape         in   different specimens;
it   contracts         at    its   posterior end into              a     narrow tube,             B      (the oesopha
gus    of      Leydig), which opens into the vent                                   on   the upper side                of   the
body.

attached, besides the oesophagus,                                  the two ends                          the recurrent
intestine       (H),       and the caecum                (E), which           is    generally swollen                  at     its
base, and        is    perhaps the equivalent                      of   the sucking stomach.
                                                                              all by
   The recurrent intestine     considered         is                                   Burmeister            and       Lacor

vessels open            into the duodenum,     when this       or,
                                                           wanting, into the                is
ilium,     close       behind the pylorus; and       the Homoptera they are

attached         to     the recurrent intestine,                   it     seems improper                     to   consider
this      as   part    of    the ventriculus.                If    the recurrent intestine                        be   cut,   a
number          of    large cells, some with daughter-cells, exude from                                            it.
     According           to   Burmeister,               the Malpighian vessels are never less
than four         in    number; and according                           to   Lacordaire, when there are
only two, they     always attached
                             are       both ends; but      hespe     by                                      in   C.
ridum there are but two, and they are attached only  one end.                                       at
     It   seems         to   me evident that                 M. Leydig must have detached                                   the
whole canal from the skin, and,                              in    doing so, ruptured the recurrent
intestine.            In     this   case   it     would        be    very natural                for
                                                                                                  him     regard  to
the free end    the longer part
                        of         the amus.                  as                            The large rectum                  he
has evidently mistaken for the stomach, and the vent for the mouth.
There would then remain the                                  oesophagus,            which          he     has correctly
 described         as   going       to   the skin.

                                                  483
     I have repeatedly            dissected out the intestinal canal without rup.
turing the recurrent intestine; and it may                                  be observed            that the
structure of the whole digestive organs, as now described, is in
accordance with that of the other Homoptera, which would not be
the    case    if M.     Leydig is correct.
     M.   Ramdohr examined C.                Alni, but his description                  can hardly be
correct,       since     it is scarcely possible that nearly allied                          species     can
differ    so    entirely        in the arrangement                  of such important               organs.
Unless Coccus Alni              does differ very much from C. hesperidum, he has
made the same mistakes as                   M. Leydig, with the addition of having
misunderstood            or overlooked the hepatic glands, which perhaps he
may have mistaken for ovaries.
  The intestinal canal of C.                 persicae         is formed on the             same type as

   I   do not propose              to give a detailed                    account      of the nervous
system, and only allude to                it in order to mention the great variations
observed in different specimens.                     Figs. 2–9 represent different forms
of the nervous system in C. hesperidum, and fig.                                             10    that of

besides the commissure, three large nerves                                  on   each      side,   and      its
hinder extremity           is   continued into       a   still larger nervous column (C),
which passes backward for rather more than 014          inch without             of   an
throwing off any branches.      then divides, and after

nerves     to   the posterior part         of   the body.

ganglion,       sometimes quite close                        it.    Indeed,      in   more than one
instance       it   arose from the ganglion itself,                  and not from the nerve                 B

     In   the divisions                  also of the central stem                      there are very great
variations, which it would be endless to describe in detail.                                                       Perhaps
the arrangement most generally                                   met with, and that which                                   I   am
inclined to regard as the type, on account of                                                    its   presenting               the
nearest approach                    to   symmetry,          is   that the main central chord sepa
rates,     at    about 014 from                     its     origin, into two equal branches, and
these        again, after            a     course           of   about         0.1,    divide          dichotomously
(fig. 2).            In   such      a     case      the division           of  F      from       B     generally takes
place     at  a   considerable distance from the ganglion.
I      have, however, not met with many specimens presenting                                                                even
this very limited amount                         of   symmetry and regularity.
     In   fig.   4   we see the two divisions                         (G, G)          of   the central chord                     C
divide almost immediately and yet not symmetrically.                                                        In   fig.    5      the
chord     C      divides into two unequal divisions,                                   the smaller                of    which
passes along           for more than 014 before                           it   redivides, while the larger
branch         divides into               three
                                                      at

In    fig.    6      the       central         chord,        just before              its    division            into two
branches, throws off                      on   each side         a     small branchlet;                     in   fig.   7       this
                                                          Finally, figs.
                            in on
happens only                        one    side.                                4     and    7     present             us   with
some instances                      which more than four branches are given off close
to   the first division    the great chord
                                     of                                   C.
     But even         the case which
                          in             have above          I                               described as most

                                                                                       it 2            true, into two
branches                  the main central stem                                                 is
secondary branches, one                        of   which        is   smaller than the other, but the
two lesser branches are both upon the right side.      then,                                           If                   as    is
probable, we are justified   concluding that
                                                    of in
                                                  each animal the                           in
ultimate         nervous fibrils are                        somewhat equal size, that they com
pose the greater part                          of   the nerve, and that the corresponding
             it of
organs               the two sides               of    the body receive                    an    equal amount                     of
nerves,           is      evident that some                  of      the parts which                   on   the left side
are supplied               by
                the large outer branch must                                                 on    the right side                  be
connected with the median branch.
  We         see, therefore, that                 not only           is   the branching                 of   the nerves
                                                                     the two sides entirely unsym

absolutely           irregular,
                      and that
metrical, but even the number                                        main stems proceeding from the

                                        486
ganglion is not always the same.            This result has surprised      me very
much, since      if  any organs might have been expected to be almost
invariable,    I should have thought        it would have      been    the nervous
system.      I  believe that no parallel case has been described, nor do
I even remember to have seen a description                of any variation occur
ring in the larger nerves of any animal whatsoever.                   Considering,
however, how great are the variations which occur here in the same
species,  it is evident that differences in the distribution of the nerves
in nearly allied forms are in themselves no proof that such species
were separately created.
   Around the ganglionic         masses are several       large spherical bodies.
                                                    “ Zellenkorper,”
These appear to be        homologous with the                             described
by Leuckart as surrounding           the supracrsophageial ganglion          in the
larva of Melop/zagua.          He considers them       also as homologous      with
similar organs which have been observed in the embryos of other
insects by Heroldt and        K6lliker*.
   Dujardin (Ann.        des Sci.   Nat. 1850, 3rd      sér. vol. xiv. p. 202) de
scribes the supramsophageal ganglion of the worker-ants as consisting
of several isolated parts, and       I was at <U+FB01>rst inclined to consider these
spherical blodies     as also  merely isolated parts of the ganglionic mass,
in favour of which view it may             be urged      that fewer nerves than
usual    appear to proceed from           this   mass.     The contents of the
spherical bodies, however, under the in<U+FB02>uence of reagents, present
an appearance different from that          of the supratesophageal mass.
   The   suboesophageal      ganglion is very richly supplied with tracheas,
derived from two large stems which are attached to the front angles,
and ramify from thence all over the mass.
   The supracesophageal ganglion is a triangular mass with its                 apex
behind.     The two front corners terminate in large nerves.
   The nervous system of C. persicw differs but little from that of
C. hesperidum,         and   offers  the    same    extraordinary      amount     of
variation.      The two    species, however, could be at once distinguished
by the superior size of the subcesophageal           ganglion in C. persicw, in
which   species also the last pair     of nerves (<U+FB01>g. 10) is given off more
posteriorly,    while both they and the central stem are considerably
swollen at their origin, so as to give the hind margin of the ganglion
a three-pronged outline.

           In    the conception                this idea,        I       have studied the deportment                             of
 cyanic acid and some                              its   derivatives with phosphoretted hydrogen
 and         its   homologues,         in     the hope             of     producing              combinations             similar
 in        constitution     to    the ureas, but differing                          from these substances                        by
 containing phosphorus                        in    the place            of   one equivalent                of   nitrogen.
       The action          of    cyanate and sulphocyanide                             of    phenyl,            an    account    of

 phosphine,            seemed          to    include the conditions                          for the realization                 of
 such compounds.
       On bringing cyanate                     of   phenyl          in    contact with triethylphosphine,
a     most lively reaction ensues; the mixture                                          begins             to   boil, and the
 phosphorus-base                 is   apt     to     be       inflamed.            On cooling, the liquid                    soli
 difies into         a   crystalline mass, which                          is   insoluble          in   water, soluble            in
 alcohol and ether, and crystallizes from the latter solvent                                                      in   beautiful
 little square tables,                tasteless, inodorous, and infusible                                  at   100°C.          On
 submitting this compound                                to    analysis,   I       was surprised                 to    find that
       contained          no     phosphorus,                  and that              exhibited              the composition

triethylphosphine participates       only indirectly   in   the reaction;     in
giving rise to the transformation of the cyanate, the phosphorous
body plays the part of a ferment, a comparison which is moreover
suggested by the large proportion of cyanate over which the influence
of   a minute   quantity   of phosphorus-base extends.           A   glass rod
moistened with triethylphosphine        solidifies, almost instantaneously,
a considerable quantity of the cyanate.          The transformation of the
cyanate under     the influence    of triethylphosphine, into cyanurate,
although the principal phase of the reaction, is attended by other
changes which    I intend   to examine more minutely by and by.
    Very different results were obtained by substituting for the cyanate
the sulphocyanide of phenyl.         The reaction between this body and
triethylphosphine    is very violent, and frequently gives rise to the      in
flammation    of the phosphorus-base.         The mixture     assumes   a deep
yellow colour, and often deposits splendid yellow needles on cooling;
frequently, however,    it remains liquid for hours and        even  for days,
but suddenly solidifies, when touched with a glass rod, into a hard,
yellow, crystalline mass. This substance is insoluble in water; it
dissolves with the greatest facility in alcohol, hot or cold, likewise       in
warm, less so in cold ether.         Recrystallization   from boiling ether
affords, in fact, the best means     of procuring the   new body     in a state
of purity.    This end is likewise considerably facilitated, by allowing
the sulphocyanide of phenyl to act upon the triethylphosphine            in the
presence   of a considerable quantity     of ether.
    In the pure state the new compound presents itself in the form of
well-defined prisms of uranium-yellow colour, which fuse at 61° C.
They cannot be heated much beyond their fusing-point without being
altered; at 100° C. they are entirely decomposed, evolving a most
peculiar   odour, which is also observed on evaporating the ethereal
mother-liquor.
    The new compound possesses the characters of a well-defined base.
Quite insoluble in water, it dissolves in the most dilute acids, form
ing with some of them, such as hydrochloric and hydrobromic acid,
beautifully crystallized saline compounds.         From these salts the base
may be separated again by cautiously adding either potassa or              am
monia.     The hydrochloric solution of the      base yields with dichloride
of platinum     a yellow   crystalline   precipitate,  sparingly    soluble in
 water, insoluble in alcohol and ether.

a   large quantity            of  water; the liquid soon                     becomes          turbid from the
elimination           of   oily globules          of   sulphocyanide              phenyl, and now
                                                                                 of                            con

                                           492
observed.     From a concentrated solution, the base is separated                               with
out change;   but when dilute and hot solutions                          are employed, the
turbidity at first produced disappears, and after a                      few minutes           beau

appearance;      at the same        time the odour of triethylphosphine be
comes perceptible.
   With potassa the deportment is perfectly analogous, but the cry
stals formed after some time are diphenyl-sulphocarbamide   (sulpho
carbanilide, C, H, N, S) instead of phenyl-sulphocarbamide.
  On adding to an ethereal solution of the urea a few drops of bisul
phide of carbon, the liquid, when gently heated, assumes a deep
crimson colour,        and deposits, on cooling, the beautiful compound
(C, H.), P, C. S., which I have described some time agot.      The
mother-liquor yields on evaporation oily drops of sulphocyanide of
phenyl.
    The deportment             of triethylphosphine              with    sulphocyanide                of
phenyl induced me to investigate the action of this body upon several
other sulphocyanides.   The substance which at once suggested itself
for examination was sulphocyanide of allyl, mustard-oil. This com
pound reacts most powerfully with the phosphorus-base.   On mixing
the two bodies, a powerful evolution                  of heat takes place, and the
mixture assumes a deep brown colour, but does not solidify either on
cooling or on agitation.           After several days' standing, however, very
large well-defined crystals are deposited which unfortunately are con
taminated with the brown colouring matter of the solution.       have                          I
not yet succeeded        in getting them perfectly white, and have there
fore not analysed them.            Their formation, however, and their general
characters leave no doubt              that they are the corresponding                             allyl

   Triethylphosphine has remained in contact with sulphocyanide of
ethyl  for more than a month without depositing any crystals.
A priori, however, the formation of an urea under these circumstances
was doubtful, since sulphocyanide                of ethyl differs from the corre
 sponding phenyl- and allyl-compounds,                 even in          its   deportment with
 ammonia and the monamines.

     In   conclusion,        it   deserves            to be mentioned that there appears to
exist a similar series of arsenetted ureas.                                    Triethylarsine, when left
for some weeks in contact with sulphocyanide of phenyl, deposits
small crystals of a body which                              I   believe to be the arsenic-compound
corresponding            to the phosphorus-urea                           described in this paper.                  This
body requires a more minute examination.

  The author begins     referring      by
                                      his former paper, published    to                                                 in

principal stations            of   the Great Arc,                    in   the plane        of   the meridian, viz.
Kaliana (lat. 29° 30' 48"), Kalianpur (24° 11"), and Damargida                   7'
(18°   15"). He made them 27".853, 11".968, and 6'909 (or
          3'

communication             (in 1855), suggests that there                              is   most probably            a   de
ficiency       of   matter immediately below the mountains which will cause
a   negative deflection, and                     so   compensate for the mountain attraction.

a   slight attenuation from              a        considerable depth.   He calculates for

about 100 miles, greatly reduces the deflection,                                              it    does not reduce

your favour            I have now occupied                      for a period of four years, it affords
me great gratification to be able to announce that                                            all   those measures
which were rendered necessary                               by           this site, are now

        fostering     a   spirit      of   investigation into the laws                    of   nature, and thus
promoting the best interests                          of    its   country and           of   mankind.

their lives and discoveries have left     imperishable name           an                                       to    poste

virtues               those whom they represent—that                                    spirit      of    persevering
research which achieved such brilliant success—that regard for truth
which       deems         no   sacrifice too great when her interests are                            stake—   at
that modesty, the never-failing companion                                        of   genius, which, slightly
                                                                                                 at by
regarding             results attained,           is   almost overpowered                                the sense        of
what remains                to   be   accomplished.                When we look                          these memo
rials     of
        our predecessors, may we feel       the Romans      old, when      as                            of
they beheld the statues                     of
                           their ancestors; they declared, “Cum ma
jorum imagines intuerentur, vehementissime sibi animum       virtutem                                     ad
accendi;” and yet,    use the wordsto the Grecian orator, IIatai   of                                                c    av
indöeXpots ope, uéyavrov dyöva. Great    the competition indeed, and-   is
few are the champions worthy                           to       contend.
     In   a   former Address           I     expressed            a   hope that the late Government
would       send       an   Expedition           to   the mouth             of    the Mackenzie River                     to
continue         those magnetical                 observations, which                    had been              so    perse
veringly and successfully carried out                                      by   Capt. Maguire, and from
which expedition important                        accessions            to      our knowledge             of   the   mag
metical       laws were not unreasonably expected;                                      but unhappily                these
hopes have not been realized.                 Our disappointment may possibly                                              be
traced,        partly       to   the dislike which seems     prevail   anything    to                     to

                                           500
which can      be   designated     as a renewal     of Arctic voyages,   and partly
 to the want      of   a due    appreciation of the value of the researches
 proposed to be undertaken.              On the objections arising out of this
antipathy to Polar expeditions,             I  have said so much       on a former
occasion,    that    I   will not again advert to them, further             than    to
observe that there was no ground for believing that the dangers to
which Arctic voyagers are sometimes,               though rarely, exposed, would
have    been    encountered       in this expedition;        and doubtless      there
were    many gallant hearts eager             to face    any amount of peril        in
 so worthy a cause.          As  to the second      point, viz. the want of     a due
 appreciation      of the     researches    themselves,    I  think it impossible
 to believe   that any one of average           capacity and discernment would
 undervalue the importance              of prosecuting inquiries of this cha
 racter, were he       familiarly acquainted with the history of scienti<U+FB01>c
 discovery.      If  our leading statesmen           and legislators had perused
 with the same attention the records of the progress of science as many
of them     have devoted to the historical            memorials of the two great
nations of antiquity, can         it  be doubted that they would view these
questions in a far different spirit?
    When two powerful            nations connected together by the tie of a
 common origin and         a  common language were informed that messages
 of mutual congratulation            between    their respective rulers had been
 transmitted by the electrical current, beneath more than 2000 miles
 of the  deep waters      of the   vast Western Ocean, and that the two great
 continents of the globe had been brought, as it were, within speaking
 distance,  a general sensation         of delight pervaded their inhabitants,
 and there was no         want of appreciation of such results of scienti<U+FB01>c
 research;    but it were well for Science and for the cause of future
 discovery,   if  any great proportion of those who shared in this joy
had been able to trace the slow and gradual processes by which such
triumphs of human            genius had been <U+FB01>nally won.            I have no hesi
tation in speaking of this wondrous achievement                   as a success, for
it  has been clearly shown that the work can be performed whenever
public spirit and zeal shall supply the necessary funds.
    There is a lesson       then which many men have yet to learn, and it
is most desirable that those             especially, to whom      the   destinies of
nations are given in charge, should               learn it—a lesson which     I  may
express    in the words of        a   Report of the Parliamentary Committee

                                                        501
of the British Association, viz. “The most abstract scientific inves
tigations have often led to most useful industrial applications; and
observations and experiments, seemingly trivial and likely to lead
to no useful result, have sometimes, after the lapse of years, been
elaborated into discoveries which do honour to human nature.”
     Let us by way of illustration sketch some of the countless re
searches which preceded the invention      of the Electric Telegraph.
In 1729 Grey discovered that electricity could be transmitted through
conductors to a distance.  In 1747 it was transmitted through seve
ral miles of wire. In 1753 an anonymous writer in the ‘Scots'
Magazine’ first suggested the idea of an electric telegraph. In 1800
the voltaic battery was invented.                             In 1802 it was discovered that
the earth might be substituted for the return wire of a voltaic cir.
cuit. In 1820 Oersted discovered the mutual action of voltaic con
ductors       and magnets, the foundation                      of the    science    of Electro-mag
netism.        In 1820, also, Schwiegger                       invented      the electro-magnetic
multiplier.            In   1822 Ampère             developed the laws              of Electro-mag
metism, and discovered many new facts, and Arago detected the action
of   a voltaic current on soft                  iron.     In 1827 Ohm eliminated the laws
of the voltaic circuit. In 1832 began the brilliant researches of
Faraday, in which he discovered and enunciated the laws of voltaic
and magneto-electric induction.  In 1834 Wheatstone invented and
practically applied a method of measuring the velocity of electricity
in metallic wires.             In       1835 Gauss and Weber employed their electric
battery in establishing                  a   communication          between the Observatory           of
Göttingen and the University; and in                              July    1837 Wheatstone         first
tried his electric telegraph on the line of the London and Birmingham
Railway.          During          all   this period the voltaic battery was gradually
improved and            its   powers vastly augmented                   by   Daniell and Grove.
     Again, the progress                of   Chemistry during the last sixty years affords
abundant         evidence         of    the advantages derived from the pursuits                      of
abstract science, when viewed simply                           in   their bearing upon the com
fort and convenience of mankind.
     At   the close          of   the last century, the Swedish                    chemist, Scheele,
made      a   series    of   experiments           on   the black oxide        of   manganese.        To
some this might have seemed                       a  very unprofitable waste    time; but
                                                                                       of
what was the result?                         Chlorine was discovered,    substance
                                                                               a      the        of
greatest importance                 in       the arts.        Berthollet,    finding   that this gas

   changed the colour of the corks        of the bottles in which it      was   con
   <U+FB01>ned, suggested its employment as a bleaching agent.                  This sug
   gestion, successfully carried      out by Tennant,       produced a complete
   revolution   in the staple trade of Manchester            and Glasgow.       The
   operations  of the bleacher     were shortened from several        months to as
   many hours.       The discovery of iodine was the result of a not very
   promising examination of the refuse of kelp liquors; and a laborious
   train of investigation into the laws of decomposition gave us chloro
   form.     But what inestimable bene<U+FB01>ts have accrued to mankind from
   these discoveries!      I  need   hardly   speak of the vast alleviation       of
   human suffering which is due to the guarded use of the latter sub
   stance; and the former,         in addition to its medicinal value, is the
   basis   of photography,      one  of the most beautiful and curious of
   modern arts, which not only adds to our rational enjoyments, but is
   extensively used in scienti<U+FB01>c      researches,    and ministers e<U+FB02>iciently to
   the useful purposes     of life.
      Then, again, Professor Owen astonished his audience at Leeds, by
   relating how much agricultural         wealth had been derived from the
   proper application of a single once-neglected fossil.
      The hopes which I at       one time entertained that the Government
   of Victoria would erect       at Melbourne      :1 four-foot   re<U+FB02>ector for the
   observation of the Southern Nebulae, have not hitherto been ful<U+FB01>lled.
   The General Committee of the British Association             have voted   0. sum
   of £200 towards carrying out the project, on condition that the
   remainder of the funds shall be supplied by the local government ;
   and   this course they have taken in testimony of the interest which
   they feel in the proposed measure, and of their                 desire to see it
   carried fully into    effect.    Our posterity will      have   just ground of
   complaint   if  the task be much longer postponed of surveying and
   delineating    the forms and      peculiarities    of these   southern nebulae
   with instrumental     means,   equal to the work, and capable of supple
   menting what has been done and is now doing for the nebulae visible
   in our own latitudes by the magni<U+FB01>cent instrument, for which Science
   is indebted to your late President.         The possession by this country
   of vast colonies in various parts of the globe, offering facilities for
   the erection of observatories and instruments for pursuing our re
   searches into    nature’s laws under every variety of climate and po
   sition on the earth’s surface, does seem to impose on a great and

                                                     503
thriving nation some obligation to utilize these advantages for the
welfare of mankind at large.                       Truly something besides material gold
is to be had there for the seeking; the precious                                   ores   of intellectual
progress may there also be culled and stored away.
     The history of the progress of astronomical                                   science has already
disclosed           both the evil effects            of neglecting           these       duties, and the
benefits which are likely to accrue when they are properly fulfilled.
When, in 1819, Encke computed the orbit of the comet of short
period, which justly bears his honoured name, and announced                                                     its
return         in   1822, that return would not have been observed had not
                                                                                                                its an

reappearance was noted.                       Subsequently, the observatory                  at   the Cape
in of
     Good Hope was established; but for many years, both there and
     Australia, the instrumental means provided for the observation
                                                                                                                is of
comets were inadequate                   to   the due discharge          of   the task.          Now      it
well known that the motions   the comet            of
                                            Encke first suggested       of
toastronomers the probability   the existence    some highly at
                                                    of                            of
tenuated medium                or   ether pervading the planetary spaces,                         in   which
both planets and comets perform their revolutions. Every succeed
ing return            of
               this most interesting though diminutive body has
tended         to   confirm and strengthen that probability,                           which has now
well nigh,       if   not entirely, assumed the proportions                         of a   physical fact.
But       on   each succeeding return               of   this wandering visitor, until 1855,

child, has had              cause   to   deplore the deficiency               of   the instruments             in
the Southern              Hemisphere,         to   which the duty            is   necessarily assigned
of      continuing          the observations after the comet has ceased                                 to      be
visible        in   these    latitudes.        Before 1855, however,                a     more powerful
equatoreal had been supplied                       to    Mr. Maclear, the able astronomer

constantly          to   see that the comet             is   observed    at   every return with                 an

pecting.” Now, it appears that these observations of 1855 fully
con<U+FB01>rmed the fact of the acceleration of the comet's mean motion,
so    often observed before;              but     they have done more than                       this,
for they have        been   so       well       made,      that     Encke      was enabled         by
their means       to correct the elements of the orbit, and calculate an
ephemeris for the return of the comet this year, taking into account
the perturbations of Jupiter, with such consummate accuracy, that
on the <U+FB01>rst       evening on which, through the absence                           of moonlight,
there was     a   hope of <U+FB01>nding          it,   which was on the 7th of August,                    it

fused nebulous mass of about one minute in diameter.                                Now,    if    the
existence of this ether, or attenuated atmosphere, pervading the
planetary spaces, should be conclusively established, of which there                                is
now scarcely any doubt,       fact of the utmost physical importance.

We may not indeed in the present                   state    of    science     be able to foresee
all the consequences which may <U+FB02>ow from its establishment;                                  but we
know enough to perceive that the question has an important bearing
upon several       interesting       modern speculations.                    The suggestion of
this resisting medium       is   only one of many important services which
this diminutive but most interesting                    comet has rendered to astro
nomical science,      and will doubtless still continue                        to render.        Mr.
Maclear’s equatoreal will now be turned to pro<U+FB01>table account in fol
lowing up the <U+FB01>ne comet of Donati, which                            has just escaped         from
our view to present itself, but shorn of most of its former splendour,
to the expectant gaze       of southern astronomers.                        Those who had the
good fortune       to observe    this comet on the night on which                           it   ap
proached Arcturus so nearly, will not easily forget the spectacle                                  it
then presented.
     You are well aware that    in our Colonies also that many of the

hourly observations were made of the three magnetical elements;
and   it   may be con<U+FB01>dently a<U+FB01>irmed that from these observations most
valuable results have been deduced, to which, however, as they were
to some extent described by me on       former occasion,a   will not               I
further allude, than to inform                   you that in the opinion                 of your
Council the time has now arrived, in which                        it   is   most expedient that

nected         by    mysterious           links; every accession                        to     our knowledge                   of
one has therefore                an   important             bearing               on   the elucidation                    of   all
the others.
  It    would appear from                 a    communication which has been received                                            by
your Council, that             it    has been          in   contemplation                    by    the Government
 to   erect,    on
              the unoccupied site   the north     Burlington House,
                                                            to                          of
an office for the Commissioners of Patents.   This      mode of em                                is
                                                                                                  a
ploying the large surplus income which                                       is   now derived from patent
fees,   to   which        no   objection can             be      reasonably made; but the whole
 subject     of   the working         of    the patent laws must                        at   no   very distant date
 again undergo            a   searching investigation.                           It    can never              be   tolerated

that inventors, to whom we owe such inestimable                          accessions     to the
conveniences and luxuries of life, should be subject to a tax peculiar
to    their   class alone ; and this must          be the effect       of the present law
solong as fees are received from the patentees exceeding the amount
which may be reasonably demanded for purposes in which they have
themselves a direct interest, and the surplus carried to the account
of the public Exchequer.     At the same time I cannot but think that
a small sum in addition might justly be required from every grantee
of a privilege of this kind, to be carried to a fund for the promotion
of the     researches     of abstract science; for assuredly there                 are none
who derive more direct bene<U+FB01>t from                   such investigations than those
from whom the payment would be demanded                          ;    and that class have,
and more especially in a country like this, opportunities                        of turning
their talents to pecuniary            account,     which   are altogether denied to
the cultivator of abstract science, who forms his nest only to be seized
by some more fortunate              occupier, coming       i.n       like the bird in the
fable, and appropriating           to his own bene<U+FB01>t the severe and long-pro
tracted labours of the skilful and painstaking                   builder.
  On reviewing once more the position of Science in this country, I
<U+FB01>nd that the voluntary or independent system has been carried very
far indeed.        That
                           is,
                           a      great many Societies have at various periods,
from      1663, the date     of this the most ancient, to the present time,
been successively founded for the promotion and encouragement of
science.       Those who compose these various associations pay for the
honour of enrolling         their    names    as members, sums which                   must be
considered large in reference to the means                       of    some    of the con
tributors;       and many of those members in addition                        devote   a   con
siderable      portion     of their valuable time to scienti<U+FB01>c researches.
These Societies,         though    contributing      so much          to the public weal,
are yet       for the most part entirely            unrecognized         by the Govern
ment, and, with certain tri<U+FB02>ing exceptions, receive no kind of public
aid in prosecuting         their valuable labours; but, on the other hand,
by    a   kind of hap-hazard          arrangement,       strongly        characteristic      of
our     national    character,      the Government         has from           time to time
organized various bodies, which,              though with few exceptions not
recognized by any act of the legislature, are yet invested to                      a    certain
extent with an official           character, and obtain greater consideration
from the Government           in consequence.           Such, for example, are the

                                                   507
Board of the Trustees of the British Museum                               ; the Board           of Visitors
of the Royal Observatory of Greenwich, which has an official con
nexion with the Board of Admiralty; the various officers to whom
the management of matters connected with science or art is com
mitted by the Council of Education, Board of Trade, or Military
or Naval authorities.              Now       if we    contrast this system                     of ours with
that of our neighbours in France and                        some       other continental states,
we shall find that there are marked and striking differences between
them.      In France there is the Institute, the members of which not
only do not pay out of their own resources for the honour they enjoy,
but are invested with high privileges and great official consideration,
and receive stipends from                 the State, at the price no doubt of an
amount of Government interference with their proceedings which our
countrymen might probably hesitate to submit         believe that              to.  I                           in
France the members                 of   the Institute,          as     such, are regularly                    con
sulted     on   the important            scientific       questions         which must present
themselves for solution from time                     to   time      in   the course of civil and
military administration.      England,  In                     on
                                            the other hand, the various
voluntary    private Societies established for the promotion
                or                                              science                             of
have never been recognized                    as   advisers     of    the Government,                  or     con
sulted
          as
          a     rule; though undoubtedly the Councils                                 of   this and other
Societies have been often applied        for advice, and more frequently
                                                     to
perhaps     of   late years than formerly; but the various Boards and
officers above referred            to   are not only invariably                     consulted        on    those
matters which are consigned                   to   their management, but there are few
instances       on   record   in   which their advice has been neglected,                                 or   the
measures recommended                 by   them have failed                to    be   carried into effect.
   In    instituting any comparison                  of   the relative merits                  of   these two
modes      of   proceeding,                   clear that, irrespective                     of   the results
                                      of it
obtained, the decision             on   the question           by as   which         is   to   be   preferred,
must depend greatly                      is
                                         the mode                 towhich the referees                   of    the
Executive       in    the two countries are appointed;                          for           may     be   fairly
                                                                                      by it
assumed that both contain men well qualified, both                                         their extensive
attainments and natural and acquired abilities,                                to   give good advice            to
their respective Governments. Now the French Institute undoubtedly
comprehends most able and highly distinguished men, enjoying                                                    an
established          and world-wide           reputation,           and well qualified                   to   give
sound advice          to   their Government               on   questions        of    science.        This      is

                                        508
undoubtedly     true, though it may be equally true that there are cir
cumstances in the working of the French               system,   dependent partly
on the immense value of the privileges              conferred by the election,
which have a tendency to arrest the wholesome progress of science in
that country.      In England,       so far as an experience      of nearly forty
years can enable me       to form an opinion,       I  should say that there is
great impartiality     and discrimination       exhibited     in the selection of
men to <U+FB01>ll high posts in the various Scienti<U+FB01>c Societies there esta
blished, and   I  apprehend there are few instances in which meritorious
and successful cultivators        of the various departments of science, if
resident in the metropolis, have failed in obtaining their share in the
government and administration of those learned bodies.                   The con
stitution of the Board of Visitors of the Greenwich Observatory also
is  worthy of all praise.      It  has contributed in some degree doubtless
to raise that establishment         to the high point of eminence          which it
now deservedly occupies;          and that constitution      has called forth the
warm eulogiums of the veteran French astronomer Biot, than whom
there can be few more competent judges.                On the other hand, the
 mode of appointing the Trustees          of the British Museum is defective
 in the extreme.     They    are nominally      elected   by the Trustees them
 selves, but the Trustees, who have been themselves elected, are by an
 absurd regulation excluded from the body of electors.              The officers of
 the Council of Education and the Board of Trade, and the Military
 and   Naval Boards      are   appointed     by the Government         or Military
 authorities, and the nominations are thus subject to all the incidents
 of appointments of this class.
    The blots in our system seem to            be,  <U+FB01>rst, that there is a great
 want of combined action.between the various communities representing
 Science ;—an evil, which might possibly be remedied by some joint
 representation of the whole; and secondly, that the Societies insti
 tuted for the promotion        of the various branches of        science,  though
 containing   among their members and governing bodies those men
 who have been impartially selected           as pre-eminent      in their various
 walks, are not officially       recognized in any way as authorities,            or
 appealed    to except occasionally        and by accident, whenever           some
 member    of the Administration may happen to perceive that their
 counsel might advance        the object in view, and be pro<U+FB01>table to the
  State.   Moreover,    it  seems never      to have occurred either         to the

                                                        509
Government           or Parliament,              that the materials exist out of which a
Board may be formed which might                                  be expected to give wholesome
advice       on scientific          questions, take on themselves a share                                         of the
Government           responsibility,            and save the country from the bad                                   con
sequences which now flow either from neglecting to take counsel, or
from the careless and indeterminate way in which                                                  it   is sometimes
sought and obtained.
     There     are other points connected                        with the important questions to
which     I   have shortly adverted, for which                                 I     must refer you to the
twelve resolutions of your Council                          of January 1857; and also to the
Report of the Parliamentary Committee                                        to the British Association
of 1855, already referred                       to,   in   which       the subject                is   discussed and
examined.
I      anticipate         much advantage                    to   science            from the circumstance
that His Royal Highness The Prince Consort has consented                                                     to   accept
the Presidency            of
                          the British Association.   Science has    need                                no             ofa

much advanced when those who occupy exalted stations, and are
endowed with great qualities                      of    mind and heart, are induced                               to   take
part
                                                                                   of of

and requirements               of  the most distinguished                              her cultivators.
  It   would appear from the Report                              of   that truly zealous and inde
fatigable officer         of   the Society, your Treasurer, dated October 1857,
that we had then            a   considerable excess    income over our average
                                                                       of
ordinary expenditure,                 that probably                   we     should             shortly      be   in   the
receipt       of annual sums               in the Stevenson Bequest, and
                                                respect          of
that   on     the demise    the tenant for life, we should come into pos
                                 of
session      of    the Handley legacy.                     This therefore renders                       it   probable
that we shall have             a    clear balance           at    the end              of   each       year; and         in
the course          of   time,      as   annuitants          die and the legacies come into
possession, that balance will                     be   augmented.
     Now since the date               of this Report,             we   agreed              to   appropriate       a    sum

sideration whether       a more advantageous employment             might not be
found for our surplus income, “ more bene<U+FB01>cial to              science and to the
Society itself, than that of continuing            to increase the accumulated
funds.”       Dr. Wollaston would probably have supported             these views;
for in his celebrated letter on establishing the Donation Fund, read
to the Council on the 11th of December, 1828, he says, “ I hereby
enjoin the President, Council,         and Fellows not to hoard the dividends
parsimoniously,       but expend them liberally,        and as nearly as may be
annually.”
     Now there     are some who      think that    we should   look forward      to a
time when the payment of annual subscriptions                  should be discon
tinued.      I  cannot subscribe to this opinion.           It is true, that there
 are men who by natural talent, by incredible perseverance,               self-(levo
 tion and industry, have risen, as         it were, from the ranks of       science,
to whom the large payments              exacted from members are a serious
 inconvenience and an obstruction            to their   obtaining   those honours
 which they have justly earned by the labours of              a well-spent youth.
 Let such men          be  excused;     but   I   cannot   comprehend      on what
 principle    we should      refuse to receive      pecuniary    contributions    for
 a most worthy        object, from those who are not unwilling and are
 perfectly able to pay them in exchange for the honours and many
  other advantages      which their Fellowship confers upon them. There
  may be some,      again, who imagine that there will be some dif<U+FB01>culty
 in discovering     a mode     of expending this anticipated surplus which
  is  likely to     meet   with general approval.           I cannot believe it.
  There are many works which cannot be written;                  many researches,
  experiments,     and    observations which       cannot   be made,    reduced or
  published; many voyages and travels that cannot                  be   undertaken
  because    the necessary      funds are not to be had.          Moreover,     there
  is a mode        of   applying    a   part   of   these  accumulations,      which
   has suggested itself to some of the members of your Council,                     to
  which    I will allude very brie<U+FB02>y.       Your Secretaries    are always chosen
  from among the most            distinguished     of your Fellows.       They     are
   generally   men who are occupied            in professional    and professorial
   duties which embrace a very large portion of their time; and it is
  their precious leisure hours only which they can devote to your ser
   vice; hours, which when not given to necessary relaxation, they would

probably employ in scientific                            research     or private study.                 It   might be
truly said that no payment that                              we can afford              to make could be a
sufficient return for such services as they render under such circum
stances.    It is not intended however, doubtless, that the full value
should be given.               It    is perhaps right that the honour conferred by
the appointment should constitute a part of the reward, but the
remaining or pecuniary part may be so trifling as necessarily to ex
clude from your service                     some who cannot                   afford to accept office on
terms so inadequate.
     And now, in conclusion,                    I bid you        farewell, and           I     do so with a most
cordial and heartfelt expression of gratitude for the unvaried                                                   kind
mess and confidence which                            I    have ever received from you.
                                                                     The
transaction of your business has necessarily brought    me into  frequent
and most confidential intercourse with  your  officers, and     can truly                               I
say that      I   have ever received from them the most effective support
and assistance; they have given me sound advice without obtruding
it,and have brought                        to
                          the conduct and administration     your                                               of
affairs      an    amount           of      talent, zeal            for your interests, and varied
acquirements, which may                         be   equalled, but which                 it     will     be   very   dif
ficult indeed          to   surpass.         The intimate relations and unreserved con
fidence which have ever existed between                                    us   have created           a    friendship
which         hope may endure                        as   long      as   my life               prolonged.            The

and the affairs          of    the Society are                 by    them discussed and transacted
in  a   manner which has always excited                               in   me great admiration.

   The Copley Medal has been awarded   Sir Charles Lyell for those       to

   accorded to it.
      A   quarter   of a century    has now just elapsed          since the Royal
   Medal    was   awarded to Sir        Charles   Lyell for his       ‘
                                                                         Principles of
   Geology.’
      It was his good fortune to be associated          in his earliest years with
   those from whom        he imbibed a      love of Natural History, and who
   fostered those habits of accurate observation, the successful appli
   cation of which to geological          problems    is one of      the prominent
   features of his scienti<U+FB01>c      writings.    This it   was   that gave so much
   value and promise to his <U+FB01>rst labours on the geology of the marls
   and freshwater formations of Angus, his native district            ;  that enabled
   him to appreciate to the full, the bearings, not only of palaeontology
   (the importance of which had been already recognized), but also of
   a large class of facts, of almost equal value in relation to the philo
   sophy of geology, conducting          him through a series of researches,
   the   merit  of originating     which is wholly his own:—I allude to
   the permanence or mutability           of animal     and   vegetable forms,      to
   their reciprocal    action, and to the laws which govern their repro
   duction   and dispersion; and we hence           owe to him     both the enun
   ciation and the demonstration          of the doctrine, that       the   history of
   many ancient geographical changes and geological phenomena is only
   to he arrived at after a careful       study of the present distribution of
   organic beings.
      The   same   line of research led Sir C. Lyell, in conjunction              with
   M. Deshayes, to that method of classifying strata,                   and  hence  of
   comparing formations, by the relative proportions of living organisms
   they contain,—-a method which has proved of such eminent service to
   geologists.    By its aid, and after untiring diligence in collecting, and
   equal perseverance and sagacity in comparing the results of his own
   and other collections, with those in the various museums of Europe
   and America,      he has not only largely         contributed     to classify the
   tertiary rocks of both continents, but has further given us the <U+FB01>rst
   clear idea of the relations of modern strata separated by the great
   valley of the Atlantic Ocean.
      In immediate connexion with             these    inquiries,   and no       doubt
   directly  originating    in his mind from that principle to which he
   has steadfastly adhered, of endeavouring to account for past changes

by   a reference          to existing           causes, are           his philosophical views of the
relations of climate to the former extension of land and water, which
have resulted in doctrines of the highest importance. This prin
ciple, long disputed, is now so far recognized, that no cautious
maturalist          declares himself satisfied with the explanation                                         of   a    geo
logical phenomenon except he                               can       test or illustrate           it by agencies
now in operation.                    It    is true that Hutton and Playfair originated
the hypothesis that causes such                                as are now   in action would account
for      all
       we see      the surface on                          of       the globe; but we owe       Sir                 to
Charles Lyell that careful collection                                     of   facts and          that sagacious
reasoning,           by   which this hypothesis has been raised                                  to   the rank        of   a
well-grounded             theory.
   We cannot overrate the services which    has rendered by his in             he
vestigations into the dynamics   geology; nor the importance

                              denudation which all formations have
undergone.               These,       and       a   vast number                of   subsidiary phenomena,
have led him              by    an   elaborate train             of   reasoning,           to   gauge boldly the
                                                                                                                 by

startling speculations                    on    the antiquity                  the earth's            crust, which,
having         survived         the       ridicule        and contempt                   of   many critics,           and
the rejection    more     by               as   visionary, are now becoming accepted                                      as
fundamental truths.
  The geology              of    volcanos        in      its   widest sense presents another great
field for observation and reflection,                            to   which Sir           C.   Lyell has assidu
ously applied himself; and here                            I        can     do      no more than allude                   to
his discoveries and discussions on “craters                                    of   elevation,” the amount
of   denudation            which          volcanic cones               have sustained, their valleys
and dykes,                                                     of                                          all   of

greatest        importance; especially, however, referring                                                the results
of   his       recent      studies         of    Etna, because they afford                            the clearest
demonstration             of     the genesis and internal                            structure            of   volcanic
mountains.
  There         is      indeed       no    department               of    geology,        -from the Silurian
strata     to   the mud now depositing                          on   our coasts            and   in   our lakes—

from the Plutonic rocks to the lavas not yet cooled on the flanks  of
Vesuvius—that Sir Charles has not diligently explored, from Scan
dinavia to Sicily and the Canaries, and from Canada to the Gulf of
Florida; he has sought to develop the history of coal by observa
tions on the ancient carboniferous strata of both hemispheres, on the
superficial peats of England, and on the vegetable swamps of the
United States; tracing at the same time the coasts of the former
glacial ocean, by the boulders that are the landmarks of                                                its   ancient
shores, and          by   the broken shells thrown                       up    on    its   beach.
     In   thus recognizing those attainments and powers                                      of   generalization
which have for the first time brought                                  so   many branches               of    science
into close connexion, and have placed Sir Charles                                               Lyell foremost

ing them        is   enhanced           by   the reflection that            I    am conferring pleasure
 on   one whose friendship                I       have now enjoyed for                     a    period        of   more

     The Rumford Medal has                                                  to   M. Jamin, Professor
                                                                                                                     re at

the Ecole Polytechnique                      of   Paris,       for     his various experimental
 searches       on   Light.

                                                             515
         M. Jamin has for many years                          been engaged in a series                  of import
    ant experimental. researches in optics. One of his earliest labours
    relates to metallic reflexion.  Malus found that metals form an
    exception               to the general rule             of polarizing light at a proper angle
    of    incidence, though                   they do produce a partial                   polarization.           We
    owe to Sir David Brewster the discovery                            of the curious modifications
    which reflexion at the surface of a                           metal is capable of producing on
    polarized light.  The theory of undulations enables us to form a
    clear idea of the nature of the light so reflected, and shows, more
    over, that in order to know                             everything        about the reflected light,
-   whatever be the nature of the incident light, it is sufficient to know
    for each angle of incidence three things; the proportion in which
    light polarized in each of the two principal planes is reflected, and
    the difference of phase produced                                by reflexion.            The subject of
    metallic reflexion had afterwards                          been      considered in           its   bearings    on
    certain phenomena;                        but there were still wanting,                 on   the one hand,
     an
      extensive series                   of
                          careful measures    the three quantities above of
    mentioned, taken for various incidences and for different metals; and
     on   the other,            a     theory which should             embrace them all, expressing
    them     as      functions           of   the angle      of  incidence      by   formulae containing           a
    certain number                  of   constants depending             on    the mature        of    the metal.
         M. Jamin applied himself                       to   supply the first          of   these desiderata;
                 on he an
    and     in              important paper published               in   the    Annales          de   Chimie      for
    1847,                   has given tables containing the results                    of   careful measures
    taken                   several    metals.     The methods employed cannot here                                be
    described, but they exhibited                       in   a    remarkable manner              a    combination
    of    experimental care and skill with                          a    thorough       acquaintance with
    the principles                  of   the    theory       of   undulations.         It     belongs        to   the
    physical                mathematician         to   supply       the requisite           formulae,        which,
    while differing from mere empirical formulae                                 in    being deduced from
    a   physical             theory, shall accurately represent the results                            of   observa
    tion.
         The subject              of     metallic reflexion           had engaged the attention                    of
    mathematicians, and                       M. Cauchy had arrived               at   certain formulae            to
    express         everything relating                to   the metallic reflexion           of   homogeneous
    light.        These formulae contain only two arbitrary constants, depend
    ing upon the nature                   of    the metal, and capable               of   being determined
     by   the observation                of   two angles.          M. Jamin himself has compared

                                         516
 the results of his observations with the formulae of                M. Cauchy;
 and the accordance of the calculated               and    observed   numbers is
 striking in the highest degree.
    Another highly important memoir of M. Jamin, read before the
 Academy of Sciences, and published in the ‘Annales de Chimie’ for
 1850, relates to the re<U+FB02>exion        of light at the surface of transparent
 media.     According to the formulae of Fresnel, when light polarized
 perpendicularly   to the plane    of incidence is incident on such     a medium,
 and the angle of incidence is increased from 0° to 90°, at               a certain
 angle (the    polarizing     angle) the re<U+FB02>ected       light vanishes,     and   in
 passing through this angle the re<U+FB02>ected vibration changes sign, or in
 other words, the phase is changed by half an undulation.                   It  had
 already been recognized, that in the case of very highly refracting
 substances   these   results di<U+FB02>'er     very sensibly from      the phenomena
actually observed;       and by observations on Newton’s              rings when
formed between a glass         lens and a plate of diamond,       Mr. Airy long
ago showed that      in the    case  of diamond the light does not wholly
vanish at the polarizing          angle, and that in passing through this
angle,  on increasing the angle of incidence, a continuous              but rapid
retardation    of phase     takes place, amounting        to a quantity sensibly
equal to half an nndulation,        while the angle of incidence is increased
a few degrees.      But except in the case of substances of very high
refractive power, it had been supposed that Fresnel's formulae sen
sibly represented the phenomena observed.             Such was the state of the
subject when    M. Jamin commenced           a series  of most elaborate     expe
rimental researches,     which     resulted in showing that the phenomena
above   mentioned, instead of being con<U+FB01>ned to a few of the most
highly refractive bodies,      were  of almost universal occurrence, though
for most bodies the only sensible changes of phase were                   crowded
within   a small range    of incidence, and the quantity of light re<U+FB02>ected
at the minimum        was very small.        A very striking result of these
researches   was, that    the    change of phase had not always the same
sign.    It appeared that for bodies having a higher            refractive index
than about 1'46, the change was of the same sign as in the case of
metals, while for bodies having           a refractive   index   much lower it
was   the opposite.      Thus the      case  of no re<U+FB02>exion      at a particular
angle, accompanied by an abrupt change            of   phase amounting to      half
an nndulation,    or, as  in this special instance it may       be more simply

                                     517
considered, a change of sign in the reflected vibration in passing
through zero, proves to be merely the separating case between two
opposite classes   of phenomena. M. Jamin has further compared the
results of his observations with the formulae of M. Cauchy, with
which they manifest a striking agreement. These formulae contain,
besides the index of refraction, a second constant, which M. Jamin
calls the coefficient of ellipticity, which must be determined for each
substance in particular.
    In a later memoir published      in the Annales   de Chimie’ for 1851,
M. Jamin       has extended   the same     results to liquids, which offer
several examples    of what had     been already perceived   in the  case  of
solids; that though    if bodies be arranged in order according to their
decreasing refractive indices, the coefficient of ellipticity on the whole
decreases,   and after vanishing increases again negatively, yet there
 exist exceptions enough to this rule to show that the coefficient         of
ellipticity cannot   be a function     merely of the refractive index, but
must depend also upon the nature of the body.
    The preceding volume of the same work contains two other
 memoirs by M. Jamin; one on the double refraction of quartz, the
other on total internal     reflexion; both affording new proofs of his
 skill and sagacity.
    In a paper published in the ‘Annales         de  Chimie’  for 1852,   M.
 Jamin has shown the influence on the phenomenon of Newton's
 rings of the reflexion of light polarized in the plane of incidence in
 the neighbourhood     of the angle of maximum polarization, and of the
 changes   of phase which it then undergoes.        The paper contains also
 other results relating to the rings which are worthy         of notice, not
 belonging specially to what takes place near the angle of maximum
 polarization.
    There are other papers of M. Jamin's to which time will not
 permit me to refer; but in the year 1856 he brought before the
 French Academy an instrument, in which he utilized, in a most happy
 manner, the fringes which had long before been observed as arising
 from the interference of some     of the many portions into which light
 is divided by reflexion at the surfaces of two plates of glass of equal
 thickness. This instrument constitutes an interference-refractometer
 which unites delicacy with singular convenience.
     In the  same   communication      the author   has given some highly

curious applications of his instrument to the obtaining of qualitative
results, having applied it to show the concentration of the solution
of an iron salt produced by the attraction of a magnet, the state of
a solution about a growing crystal, &c. The use of the instrument
                         by

author         has successfully              determined                 by      its   means the             refracting

     But    in    none         of   Mr. Hancock's labours are                          these          faculties      so
eminently displayed                  as   in    his more recent investigation                      of   the organ

       MR. HUxLEY,
     In   conveying this Medal                      to   Mr. Hancock, assure him                      of    the great
interest we take               in   his valuable labours, and express our hope that
he may          be   long enabled              to   prosecute inquiries, from which                          so   much
benefit     to    natural science may reasonably                           be   anticipated.
  Your Council have awarded the other Royal Medal        Mr. William                             to
Lassell, for his various astronomical discoveries and researches, and
for his skilful construction                         of
                               several large Reflecting Telescopes,
with which such discoveries were made.
     The first        of                                   having         speculum          of
                                                                                                                     of in
                            these telescopes,                         a                           nine inches
diameter, was erected                     at    Starfield near Liverpool                 in   the summer
 1840, from which                   time       Mr. Lassell has             been    a    most diligent and
successful labourer                 in    the field       of   astronomical            science.            Although
none       of   the principal discoveries which entitle him                                 to   take rank with
the leading astronomers                        of   the day have been made with this                          instru
ment, still          as   this was the first large Reflector                      to   which          an   equatorial
mounting             was applied,              we are justified            in   looking upon                 its   con
struction       important
                  as      an                        step towards that eminence                         to   which    its
maker has since attained.
     This instrument, however, did not long satisfy Mr. Lassell, for                                                 in
 the year 1846 we find him observing with                                   a     20-foot reflector with

                                           520
an aperture     of 2    feet, also equatorially mounted, which he had         in the
mean time constructed;          and he soon announced the very important
discovery, on the 10th of October, 1846, of a satellite             of Neptune,—
most important, as affording          the means       of ascertaining the mass of
Neptune.
   Great triumphs, however, were yet to come; in September 1848 he
detected an eighth satellite of Saturn, and by a singular coincidence
the same discovery was made simultaneously by                  Professor   Bond in
America.
  To    these   manifold labours we have to add numerous observations
of Satellites, and of Comets, Eclipses and other occasional phe
momena.
   Of                                       Mr. Lassell has already
        this devotion to his favourite science
received a recognition, which astronomers value most highly, viz. the
Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, which was presented
to him in February 1849; but this seems only to have stimulated his
zeal for the further advancement of astronomical science.
  In    October    1851 our indefatigable          observer established the   exist
ence   of two satellites of Uranus, nearer to the planet than the first
satellite of Sir William Herschel.
  In    the autumn of 1852 he conveyed his 20-foot reflector to Malta,
principally in order to survey in               a clearer atmosphere the systems
of the three most distant planets, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune,
with which he has particularly identified himself. To use his own
words,—“his discoveries abroad were rather negative than otherwise,”
for he was satisfied that without a great increase of optical power, no
other satellite of Neptune would be discovered; and with regard to
Uranus, he says,—“I am fully persuaded that either he has no other
satellites than the four,        or   if   he has, they   remain yet to be     dis
covered.”
  In the summer of 1854, owing to the encroachment of buildings
round Starfield, he was compelled to move two miles further into the
country to Bradstones, and incur the expense of building a second
observatory, and here his instruments are now erected.
   His praiseworthy ambition still impelled him to become a leader,
where other men are content to follow.     In the prolonged discus
sions which arose relative to the mounting of the great reflector of 4
feet aperture     for
                 the observation   the Southern Nebulae, Mr. Lassell
                                           of

                                                      521
took an important and distinguished part; and with his characteristic
and laudable energy and zeal in the cause                               of   science,     finding that
such       an instrument was just now a desideratum,                               he undertook               to
construct one at his own cost.     This he has now completed. This
splendid result of the well-applied industry and skill of one to whom
Astronomical Science had                      been already indebted             for two fine tele.
scopes, has an aperture of 4 feet and 37 feet focal length, and this
is also mounted equatorially.                         From this magnificent telescope, in
the hands of such                a man, what may not be expected?                         And it adds
not    a   little to his merit, that             all   the specula for these several                instru
                                         by   himself, and polished by
                                                                                                     in of
ments have been cast                                                               a   machine               his
own contrivance,             of    which        he    has given     a   lucid description                    the
Memoirs         of   the Royal Astronomical                   Society; and the instruments
themselves are mounted according                         to   his own plans.
   In      conclusion,      it    will I      think     be   generally allowed, and posterity
will doubtless confirm the statement, that                          in   the history       of   reflecting
telescopes, the name               of
                        Lassell must rank with that Herschel and                    of
that     our late President, Lord Rosse, whether we consider the
           of
talent and perseverance displayed                        in    their construction,             or   the      im
portant discoveries which have resulted from their                                 use.
           MR. LAssELL,
   In      presenting this Medal, allow me                     to   express    a   fervent hope that
you may          be endowed with health and                     a   long life.         Your previous
labours         are the best security that                    in    that case       the    magnificent
astronomical          means now           at   your disposal will         in   due time contribute
still further         to   enlarge the bounds            of    that science which you love                    so
much and have               so   materially advanced.

      REAR-ADMIRAL  SIR FRANCIs BEAUFoRT, K.C.B.—Among the
losses which have been occasioned by death in the lapsed year, we
have to deplore that of Rear-Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort, K.C.B.,
the late Hydrographer to the Admiralty, so well and so justly known
as a scientific, indefatigable, and amiable Fellow of this and other
Societies.   This event occurred on the 17th of last December, at
Brighton, whither he had repaired for the benefit of change in fail
ing health, but with his mental faculties clear and vigorous. This,
indeed, was exemplified in his discussing historical points on the very
evening of his death; and in his consulting                the “Sacra Privata”   of
Bishop Wilson, a favourite work, almost until he calmly expired at
1h 50" after midnight: he was then in his 84th year.
  This valuable officer was a son of the Rev. Daniel Augustus Beau
fort, Rector of Navan, and Vicar of Collon in Ireland, who attained
a well-merited esteem by his elaborate map of that country, excelled
only by the subsequent Ordnance Survey.   As young Francis evinced
a predilection for maritime life, he had the good fortune to open his
nautical career with a very able seaman, Captain Lestock Wilson, of
the East India Company’s          Service, under whom he acquired a            pro
ficiency in navigation.         At     in 1789, when proceeding to
                                     length,
China, that officer received orders to examine the Macclesfield Strait
for   a shoal on   which   an   Indiaman had recently           been lost.   Opera
tions were commenced by a survey of Pulo Leat, an isle in the Strait
of Gaspar, the chart of which was entirely drawn by Beaufort.
After an unsuccessful search for the hidden danger, from eleven dif
ferent stations, and just as the attempt was about to be given up,'
the “Wansittart’     struck upon what proved to be the very reef for
which they had been seeking.           The destruction of the ship advanced
so quickly that     all
                  hands had           totake    the boats; and they under
                                                 to
went great hardships before reaching the Bay               of   Sango Boolo, where
relief was obtained.
  On returning    England, great excitement pervaded the public
                    to
mind, and armaments were under equipment        our ports. For
                                                          in    all
getting the hardships      of   his recent disaster,      Mr. Beaufort embarked

                                                      525
on board the           ‘Aquilon’ frigate, and shortly afterwards sailed to the
Mediterranean,               escorting      H.R.H.          Prince Augustus,                     since Duke of
Sussex and President                  of this Society.                In 1794, the “Aquilon” was
one of Lord Howe's “repeaters' in the great battle fought on the 1st
of June; an event which deeply impressed itself on the young
officer's mind, insomuch that he ever retained a vivid recollection of
its details.          His next ship was the ‘Phaëton, of 38 guns, in which
he saw much varied and arduous service, by which he earned his
Lieutenant's commission. Continuing in the same frigate till October
1800, he won his further promotion to the rank of Commander by
gallantly cutting out a 14-gun Spanish polacca from under the guns
of Frangerola, a fortress near Malaga.
   This promotion was somewhat dearly purchased, for Mr. Beaufort
was severely wounded on the head, and had several slugs through
his left arm and body, which compelled him to                                        lie   by   for   a   time. But
 he   had scarcely recovered, when we find him aiding his brother-in
law, Richard Lovell Edgeworth,                            in   establishing            a    line      of    telegraph
stations across Ireland;                    an   object     in   which          he   laboured successfully
and gratuitously                 during two years.               A    mind disciplined                  to   accurate
observation acquires additional                        power        of   perception and discrimina
tion; and         to   this power may                be   assigned the admirable communica
tion which            he    made      to   Dr. Wollaston,             of    certain physiological                      and
successive effects which                   he    experienced under suspended animation,
from being            all   but drowned.
      In   the summer              of   1805     Commander                 Beaufort was again called
into active service, being appointed                                  to   the       ‘Woolwich,               44;       in
which ship             he    carried out naval stores                      to   Bombay,               and returned
with    a    convoy          of    sixteen Indiamen                 and some country-ships.                             In
 1807      he    had        an   opportunity,        though but            a    hasty one,            of    exercising
his valuable talent for marine surveying by    examination     the               an                               of
vicinity     of
           Monte   Video,   the Rio      Plata. His next
                                            in             appoint
                                                                 de   la
 ment was             to    the ‘Blossom'             sloop-of-war,             in     which           he   was    prin
 cipally employed                in   taking charge         of      convoys          of    merchantmen until
 he    obtained         post-rank          in    May 1810, with the command                                       of   the
 ‘Frederickstein’ frigate.                      In   1811      he   was directed            to   make  exami an
 nation      of   the southern shores                  of   Asia Minor,               a    service truly con
 genial     to   his mind, since            it    developed his             full capacity              as   a     marine
 surveyor,       a     classical scholar,            and       an   inquiring geologist.                        He had
      WOL.      IX.                                                                                    2    N

                                       526
successfully examined the coast         of Karamania,      and was about to
continue his operations down the shores          of Syria, when they were
suddenly cut short by an attack of fanatical natives, by one of whom
 Captain Beaufort was severely,       almost fatally, wounded.        Thus pre
vented from continuing the interesting survey, he repaired to Malta,
and there, with exemplary fortitude, endured intense suffering from
his wound, which for several months endangered his very existencc._
 He was then ordered to England, in company with the ‘Rodney,’
 74, and his ship was paid       off in October  1812, after which year he
went no more a<U+FB02>oat.
    But the leisure of his half-pay time     was not expended in idleness,
as evinced by the subsequent publication           of his admirable_survey
with its illustrative memoir; and by his exertions in the Councils of
the Royal, the Astronomical, and the Geographical Societies.                 He
was, moreover, a member        of the Board of Greenwich Visitors, and
one   of the Committee of the Society for the Diffusion               of Useful
Knowledge, wherein he originated and conducted the widely-circu
lated series of cheap maps.       Yet twenty  years were permitted to pass
before he was selected to that post for which he was               so obviously
and so eminently       quali<U+FB01>ed;    for it was not till    1832    that he was
installed  Hydrographer      to the Admiralty.        This   office   had been
turned to but small account until Captain Beaufort took it in hand,
and manifested its value to the public, not only in the construction
of superior charts, but also in affording aid to the Commissions on
Tidal Harbours,      Ports of Refuge, and Pilotage; and           indeed  to all
branches of naval scienti<U+FB01>c knowledge.
   In carrying out    these duties, he was ever ready to advise and assist;
and he was a warm supporter of friendless merit, even in cases where
he was opposed by certain of<U+FB01>cial obstructions.              Through all he
conscientiously did his duty, although at times he felt it painful to
enjoin services without a prospect of reward, where it was deserved
and expected.
   Sir Francis    Beaufort    was   appointed   one   of the Civil Knights
Commanders of the Bath; and in l845'he                 accepted     the rank of
retired Rear-Admiral, with permission to retain his of<U+FB01>ce of Hydro
grapher, the daily duties of which he assiduously attended until he
was   turned   of fourscore.      He married the daughter of his <U+FB01>rst
commander, Captain Lestock Wilson, shortly after his last return

                                                              527
from the Mediterranean; and by that amiable lady had a family,                                                             of
whom three sons and three daughters are living.                                                  Some years after
her lamented death, he married, secondly, the daughter, by a third
marriage, of his brother-in-law,                              R.   L.    Edgeworth, Esq., who survived
him, but has since died.
   RoBERT BRowN, D.C.L.—In offering to the Society a brief
sketch of the career of the greatest Botanist of the age, our
attention           is chiefly             arrested           by    his intense devotion to his                           fa
vourite         study,
               and      the                by              calm,         reflecting,           and        philosophical
spirit which he brought to bear upon                                              its    pursuit, the combina
tion      of    which             qualities      were alone sufficient                          to    raise him,           by
his own unassisted efforts,                              to   the highest                position      in   the world
of of
     Science.            Robert Brown was the second and only surviving                                                   son

Scottish Episcopalian                        Church, and from them                             he    appears     to   have
inherited           a   strong        attachment               to   logical       and metaphysical studies,
                                                     strikingly manifested                       the philosophical

Scotica,’ with critical notes and observations.        Although this Paper,
like most of those read before the Society, was not intended for pub
lication, it led to the communication of his specimens and observa
tions to Dr. Withering, who was then engaged in the preparation of
                              ‘
the second edition of his       Arrangement of British Plants,’       and laid
the foundation of    a warm and intimate friendship between them.              In
 1795, soon after the embodiment       of the Fifeshire Regiment of Fen
cible Infantry, he obtained in it the double commission of Ensign
 and Assistant-surgeon,    and proceeded with it to the North of Ireland,
in various parts of which he     was stationed   until the summer of 1798,
 when he was detached to England on recruiting              service.     Fortu
nately for himself and for science, this service        enabled him to pass
several  months,    during   this and the succeeding year, in London,
where he availed himself to the utmost of the library and collections
of Sir Joseph Banks, from whom his already established botanical
reputation obtained for him a cordial reception.             In l799 he re
turned to his regimental duties in Ireland, from which he was <U+FB01>nally
recalled, in December of the following         year, by   a  letter from Sir
Joseph Banks, proposing for his acceptance the post of Naturalist
in the Expedition for surveying the coasts of New Holland, then
<U+FB01>tting out under the command of Captain Flinders.                 Within two
 days of the receipt of this letter, which placed within his reach the
so-much     coveted   opportunity    of devoting himself entirely to his
favourite pursuit, he quitted the regiment and the military service;
and in the summer of 1801 he embarked at Portsmouth,                    full of
ardour and con<U+FB01>dent of success.         His   absence from   England      lasted
more than four       years, during    which the     southern,    eastern,    and
northern coasts of New Holland, and the southern part of Van Die
men’s Land, were thoroughly explored.            In the month of October
 1805 he arrived in Liverpool with a collection             of dried plants
amounting to nearly 4000 species,       a  large proportion of which were
not only new to science, but exhibited new and extraordinary com
binations of character and habit,          Immediately on his arrival in
England,     he was appointed Librarian of the Linnean Society, of
which he had been elected an Associate in 1798.           During his    voyage
he had been indefatigable in describing with the minutest accuracy
the whole of the materials which he had collected, and in the accu
mulation of    a vast store of facts and observations in relation to their

the anatomy and physiology                          of      plants        in   general.               The new views
which were thus opened                     to   him         at on   multitude               of   botanical subjects,

transferred to the British Museum; and from this latter date to his
death, a period of upwards of thirty years, he continued to fill the
office of Keeper of the Botanical Collections in the National Esta

           Sm JAMES MACGRIGOR              was   born at Cromdale,            in Strathspey,
      lnverness-shire, on the 9th of April,          17   7].   He   received     his literary
      education at Marischal College, Aberdeen, where he took his degree
      as   M.A.  He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, and
      afterwards, with  view to improve his knowledge of anatomy, attended
                         a
      tl|e lectures and demonstrations of        Mr. Wilson in London.                 He then
      obtained the Degree of       M.D. from the Marischal College.                    In 1793
      he entered the Army by the purchase of the Surgeoncy of the 88th
      Regiment, with which Corps he served in Holland and Flanders
      throughout    the Duke of York’s campaign.                In   1796       he proceeded
      to the \Vest Indies, where,   with two companies of the regiment, he
      was engaged    in the expedition against Grenada, and in August of the
      same year returned to       England to rejoin head-quarters.                In   1799 be
      accompanied the 88th to Ceylon, and subsequently to Bombay.                          The
      regiment formed part of the Anglo-Indian Army sent to Egypt under
      the command of Sir D. Baird, and arrived at Cosseir in June 1801.
      Dr. MacGrigor                     Surgeon of the Force, and earned
                         was Superintending
      well-merited commendation by his zeal and intelligence, and his
      judicious arrangements for the sick and wounded.    In 1803 he re

                                    533
turned home with the regiment, and      was shortly afterwards appointed
to the Oxford Blues, with which he did duty at Windsor for some
time.     In  1805 he was promoted to the rank      of Deputy Inspector
of Hospitals, and was employed in the south-western district.         At
Portsmouth he superintended the landing           and treatment   of the
wounded      sent home    from Sir   John Moore's Army.       In August
 1809 he was promoted to be Inspector-General of Hospitals, and
in September was sent to Walcheren as Principal Medical Officer of
the expedition, to replace Sir J. Webb, and was highly commended
by Sir Eyre Coote for the manner in which he discharged his duty
amidst great difficulties.    In the end of the year, when that      un
fortunate    expedition  had terminated,    he returned to Portsmouth,
where he remained nearly two years.        In  1811  he was sent out to
Spain as Principal Medical Officer of the Army under Lord
Wellington, and arrived in time to be present at the siege of Ciudad
Rodrigo. He remained with the Army till the termination of the
Peninsular War, and was present in every siege and engagement from
Ciudad Rodrigo to Toulouse.        The Duke of Wellington, who was at
no time very lavish of his compliments to medical officers, thus notices
Dr. MacGrigor's services in an Order dated 26th July, 1814 —“I
have every reason to be satisfied with the manner in which      Mr. Mac
                                                                I
 Grigor conducted the department under his direction, and consider
him one of the most able, industrious, and successful public servants
 I have ever   met  with.”.
    On the termination of the war he was knighted, and received the
 Royal permission to wear the decoration of Knight Companion           of
 the Portuguese    Order of the Tower and Sword.        In 1815 he was
 appointed Director-General    of the Medical Department of the Army,
 which post he filled till 1851, when he retired from active employ
 ment.     In 1831 he was created a Baronet, and in 1851 was appointed
 to be a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.          He died on
 the 2nd of April, 1858, within a few days of entering his 88th year.
    Sir James MacGrigor was the auther of a “Memoir of the state
 of health of the 88th and other Regiments at Ceylon and Bombay,
 from 1st June 1800 to 31st May 1801;” of a “Medical sketch of
 the Expedition to Egypt from India;” and of a “Sketch of the
 Medical History of the British Army in the Peninsula of Spain and
 Portugal during the late Campaign.”

     Shortly after his appointment to be Director-General,                                      he organized
a system of Returns                 from the different stations occupied by British
troops, from which, after a lapse                      of twenty years, the Statistical Re
ports on the health               of the Army were compiled.                He also commenced,
at the Invalid hospital at Chatham, a                                Museum of Natural History
and Pathological Anatomy, which, by the contributions of the medical
officers from          all   quarters   of
                                      the world, has become one  great extent                 of

the officers composing               it.             1816       he   established           Society for         pro

to   an    extent which could not fail                     to   be   gratifying      to    their founder.
     Sir   J.   MacGrigor was for two                  successive years elected Lord Rector
of   Marischal College, Aberdeen.                          The University            of      Edinburgh con
ferred      on   him the honorary degree                   of   LL.D.            On the establishment
of   the University            of   London,           he   was nominated             a     member         of       the
Senate.          He was       a   Fellow     of      the Royal Society              of       Edinburgh, and
member          of   various Medical Bodies.                    He was elected into this Society
on the 14th            of   March, 1816.

and    at   all   times accessible         to   the officers          of    his department, by whom
he   was much esteemed and respected.       He retired into private life
after having faithfully and efficiently served his country for the long
period    fifty-eight years, during thirty-six

  While still very young, Mr. Pattinson left Alston for Newcastle-on

Master to the Commissioners                   of Greenwich Hospital, the chief duty
of his office being to inspect,                as to quality and quantity,                 the ores
which are levied as royalties from the extensive lead mines in his
native district belonging            to that establishment.                It   was while thus
employed, and when his mind was directed to the improvement                                           of
metallurgic     operations, that he was led to discover his admirable and
now well-known process for extracting the silver from argentiferous
lead.     Returning to Newcastle after a few years, to undertake the
management        of Mr. Beaumont's lead-smelting and refining-works         in
that neighbourhood,             he was enabled to put in practice his method of
de-silvering lead, for which he took out a patent.                        The profits thence
accruing      afforded him the means to establish, in partnership                                with
two of his friends, a chemical manufactory at Felling, which, through
subsequent additions,             has become         one   of the most extensive in the
district; and     at a later period he discovered and brought into                prac
tical   use a method    of separating magnesia from the limestone rock
containing      that earth, and a process for producing oxychloride of
lead, a valuable pigment, directly from the ore.
   But while thus engaged in improving industrial chemistry,                                      Mr.
Pattinson was not unconcerned in matters of more purely scientific
interest; and it is more especially deserving of mention, that, contem
poraneously with Mr. Armstrong, he was one of the first to give an
account   of the remarkable fact of the evolution of electricity by
effluent steam.   He was also attached to the study of astronomy;
and although he took little part in  pursuit         its
                                                 practical observer, as
                                                                     a
 he   possessed    an   elegant observatory, furnished with                     a   transit-instru
ment, and also         an   admirable equatoreal, which,              as   is   known       to   many
 of   the Society,       he     liberally lent      to   Professor   Piazzi Smyth,               to   be
used     by   that gentleman        in   his recent expedition        to    Teneriffe.
   Mr. Pattinson was elected                  a   Fellow   of   this Society         on   the 3rd     of
June, 1852;        he   belonged also         to   the Royal Astronomical,             Geological,
and Chemical Societies: his death took place  Scots' House, his      at
residence near Newcastle,   the 11th   November,

  The Very Rev. Gaonor: PEACOCK, D.D., Dean of Ely, was born
on the 9th of April, 1791, at Thornton Hall, Denton, in the parish
of Gainford                  in the county of Durham, and about
               near Darlington,
fourteen miles from Richmond in Yorkshire, being the residence of his
father, the Rev. Thomas Peacock, incumbent and during <U+FB01>fty years
perpetual curate of that parish, where he also kept a school.                    His
family consisted of <U+FB01>ve sons and three daughters, three of the sons
by a <U+FB01>rst marriage, and the other two, with                 the daughters, by a
second;     George being the youngest son of the <U+FB01>ve.                In early youth
he showed no precocity of genius, but was            a   bold and active lad fond
of out-door sports, and, if remarkable for anything, rather for his
daring feats in climbing, which sometimes led him into very dan
gerous situations, than for any special attachment to study.                   From
the nature of his father’s occupation, it is not probable that he lacked
the usual elementary instructions; but his early reading was desul
tory, books of voyages      and travels being most in favour with him;
nor was it until, with a view to his future college career, he was sent
at nearly seventeen years of age (in January 1808) to the school of the
Rev. Mr. Tate (formerly a Fellow of Sydney Sussex College, Cam
bridge) at Richmond,       that his great natural powers began to develope
themselves.        Here, however, he applied himself with diligence to the
studies of the school, and with such success, that at the              July   exami
nation he was placed alone,       by a decided superiority, at the head of
his class, in which it may be noticed were two boys who afterwards
became     Fellows,   and four others who became             Scholars of Trinity
College.     He did not live in Mr. Tate’s         house,   but in lodgings near
it,   and had his evenings uninterrupted           for study, which he used to
such purpose as to have read far in advance of the classical course
of the school, and      to have   obtained an accurate knowledge of the
niceties of Greek criticism, as well as        a    habit of sound rendering
both of the Greek and Latin        classics.    During one or more of the
vacations, particularly    the summer one      of 1809, he also read mathe
matics with    Mr., afterwards Dr. Brass,      at that time      a   distinguished
Undergraduate       of Trinity, from    the town and school          of Richmond,
and who subsequently took         a   Wrangler’s     degree.    It    would seem,
however, that up to the period of his entry at Trinity College                    in
October    1809,    his mathematical reading had not extended much
beyond the <U+FB01>rst year’s subjects then studied at Cambridge.                      We

                                                                  537
have the testimony                  of one of his schoolfellows, afterwards himself
a distinguished                 ornament of the same University and College, that
during his whole time at Richmond, “though a severe student, he
was a joyous, sociable, and genial spirit, always ready for good com
panionship,             for any pleasurable excursion, for manly exercise, and
for     all   innocent mirth and playfulness.”                                 How well calculated,                               as

                                                                       his pupil, may

the terms             in   which          their connexion                   is   spoken          of           the dedication
of his first considerable mathematical work,—terms which indicate
more than               an      ordinary community                       of      feeling and facility                   of    inter

high reputation                     of    his college, and commanded the attention and

                                      538
admiration of his pupils, he succeeded        to an extraordinary degree in
winning their personal attachment by the uniform kindliness of his
temper and disposition,     the practical good sense of his advice and
admonitions, and the absence of all moroseness,            austerity, or need
less interference  with their conduct.      “ His inspection of his pupils,”
says one     of them, “was not minute, far        less vexatious;    but it was
always effectual, and at all critical points of their career, keen and
searching.      His insight into character    was remarkable.”
     It was impossible for any one, at the epoch       of his undergraduacy,
 and for several years preceding that epoch, drawn on to read exten
 sively in mathematics for the sake of the science itself, and thus
 becoming aware of the progress made on the continent in that depart
 ment of knowledge, while at the same time subjected to the course
 of reading then pursued for the Senate-house examinations, not to
 become at the same time unpleasingly sensible to what we must now
 consider the discreditable state of Cambridge        mathematics then pre
 valent.     Peacock, in common with many other students of his own
 standing, was profoundly impressed with this, and resolved, so far as
 in him lay, to contribute towards remedying the evil.             Accordingly
 we <U+FB01>nd him, so soon as relieved from the pressure            of examinations,
 exerting himself vigorously in the cause of mathematical improve
 ment.      As  a preliminary   step towards introducing       the continental
 methods and the spirit of the higher analysis, he joined with two
 fellow-students    of his own year (Messrs. Babbage and Herschel) in
 the task, more useful than brilliant, of translating the smaller work
 of Lacroix     on the di<U+FB01>erential   and integral calculus.       This transla
 tion, published    at Cambridge     in  1816,   was followed    by   a copious
 collection of examples in 1820;        and, the sale    of both being rapid,
 contributed no doubt materially to further the object in view.             His
 position as Moderator for 1817 supplied him with a powerful lever
 for urging forward this movement, and he was not backward in avail
 ing himself of it.      In his questions for the Senate-house examina
 tion for that year, the differential notation of the continental analysts
 was for the <U+FB01>rst time     o<U+FB01>icially employed in Cambridge; an innova
 tion which passed not altogether without censure.              How little this
 affected   him will appear from the following extract of a letter to          a
  friend, which we have before us, dated March 17, 1817.

cation     of   improved elementary books.                            I     have considerable influence
as   a   lecturer, and        I     will not neglect             it.      It      is   by   silent perseverance

became        a    Fellow          of   the Royal, and subsequently                          of       the Geological

      In   1825–26            he   contributed       to   the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana                                 an

guage, must have been the result of a world of reading and toilsome
antiquarian research.                       In 1830 he supplied by his treatise on Algebra
one of the greatest deficiencies in our whole circle                                                of mathematical
reading,-that,                   namely,      of a sound elementary work on that subject
based on truly philosophical                           principles, and explaining                           the true gist

formation          of       clear logical habits               of   thought.                   In    this remarkable
work, the ideas propounded                             by    Buée, Argand, Mourey and Warren,
respecting the geometrical interpretation                                    of    imaginary symbols, were
for the first time presented                           to   the student           in      an   elementary treatise
as      part and parcel             of   the general subject, and                    as   intimately interwoven

The position which                       he       then held      in   the University,                 Lowndean
                                                                                                            as
Professor          of      (to which office
                        Mathematics                                                 he    was elected    1837),  in
identifies this work with the University                                             which              was produced
 as     a    contribution           to    scientific         literature          of in   which      it it   may well          be
proud.
        In   this, his capacity             of     Lowndes Professor,                     he   at   first gave        a   series
of      lectures       on   practical and theoretical astronomy;                                and when,             by   mu
tual arrangement with the Plumian Professor, these lectures,                                         belong

that officer,               he   delivered        a   course     on   geometry, and for three                              suc

                                      for a course on the principles
cessive years attempted to form a class
of      analysis and their application.
                                   Those who are conversant with
the mode in which the mathematical studies of the junior members
of the University are prosecuted, will not be astonished that the
attendance was small.                          Not discouraged, he attempted to form a
class for astronomy,                      but though          at first successful, the attendance
was not maintained in subsequent years.
        In   1838 Professor Peacock was appointed                               a member            of the Par
liamentary Commission for considering                                   the steps to be taken for the
restorationof the Standards of Weight and Measure destroyed by
the burning  of the Houses of Parliament. To the duties of this
Commission               he gave his diligent attention, and it was indebted to
him for many valuable and useful suggestions.                                         Of the Second Com
mission, appointed                    in 1843 to carry out the report of the first by
the construction of new standards, he was also a member.
    In       1839 he was appointed to the Deanery                              of Ely, vacated by the
death of Dr. Wood, and with this appointment ceased, of course, his
connexion, as Tutor, with                      Trinity College, and his residence at Cam
bridge other than such as the duties of his Professorship                                             required.
In this position it is too little to say that he conscientiously devoted
himself to the performance of                           its   duties.         He went into them with
 all                                 earnest and pious spirit, and with                       all

        the zeal        of                                                                          the energy
and prudence                         an   able and practical             administrator.             The vene
rable and beautiful                   fabric    of   the Cathedral            had fallen into grievous
decay, and had even become endangered                                    by   neglect.        Its restoration
became one             of his principal objects, for the accomplishment                               ofwhich
as he
        exerted himself with such success, that                              it   remains distinguished

in his collection and republication          of his numerous      and    important
papers and memoirs, originally printed either as separate works, or
in the Transactions of this Society and various journals and periodi
cal works, he has conferred a lasting          bene<U+FB01>t   on Science while doing
justice to one of its most distinguished ornaments.             There can be no
 doubt that this work must have cost him              a vast amount of labour.
 Few scienti<U+FB01>c writers, thinking so profoundly            and arriving at such
 important conclusions, have adopted a form of exposition so obscure
 and di<U+FB02>icult to follow as Dr. Young.            The discussion of       these  me
 moirs in the Biographical        volume of Dr. Peacock’s work, however,
 shows that he had completely overcome             this di<U+FB01>iculty,    and obtained
 a   perfect   appretiation   both of their merit and         method.        In the
 Archaeological department of this work he had for a                coadjutor Mr.
 Leitch, who edited the volume            devoted   to Dr. Young’s Hierogly
 phical   discoveries.     This work       occupied him at intervals spread
 over a period    of twenty   years,  and was only published in 1855, three
 years before his own decease.
    Dr. Peacock     was an active member          of both the Cambridge Uni
 versity Commissions      (of  1850 and 1855).         Earnestly devoted to the
 improvement of the University           system, he had early made its sta
 tutes and history an object of especial study, and had stated, in the
 form of observations published in 1840 on its constitution                and stu
 dies, and in 1841 on its statutes, the result of his impressions on
 a variety   of points in which be conceived amelioration practicable.
 He   came therefore to this arduous and by no means                  popular duty
 fully prepared, by intimate practical acquaintance with the working
 of the then existing system, and by long meditation, resulting in an
 entire conviction of the desirableness of a very considerable amount
of change in the directions indicated in the Report of the <U+FB01>rst Com
mission.      These views he throughout         supported, however, with per
 fect candour and moderation, and with an earnest desire,                 as far as
 possible, to conciliate opposition, and to wound no private or indivi
dual feeling.
    In  1841 he accepted     the o<U+FB02>ice of Prolocutor of the Lower House
of the Convocation of Canterbury,             which he <U+FB01>lled       till 1847,   and
again from 1852 to 185/         ;  an office  for which the well--known tem
perateness     of his views on all those subjects where, in imperfectly
 balanced minds, strong feeling is apt to degenerate             into passionate

                                       543
advocacy,    the weight     of his character, and the uniform         dignity
(combined as     it always  was   with exceeding courtesy and gentleness)
of his personal bearing, peculiarly fitted him.
    His health, which in the earlier days of his residence at Cam
bridge, after taking his Bachelor's degree, had not been strong,          lat
terly gave way under the influence of repeated attacks of influenza
and bronchitis,     which necessitated his passing the winters in warmer
 residences.    That of 1848 he      passed  in Madeira with every promise
 of  permanent benefit.     The disorder, however, recurred in succeeding
 winters, and was aggravated in 1857 by an attack         of dysentery.   On
 the 28th of   October in the present year he attended       a meeting of the
 University Commission,        from which returning,     he took to his bed,
 exhausted by the effort, to rise no more—a striking comment on the
 expressions used by him in his letter above cited.         His decease took
 place on the 8th    of November,      1858.
     Dr. Peacock married, in 1847, Frances Elizabeth, second daughter
 of W. Selwin, Esq., Q.C.            He has left no family.      He was for
 several   years   a Vice-President     of this  Society;  in  1830–31,   and
 various subsequent sessions        down to 1856–57, he acted as a      Mem
 ber   of the Council.      Few men have left behind them a memory
 more cherished, or been attended through life by more universal
 manifestations of affectionate regard and reverential esteem.
     MAJOR-GENERAL SIR WILLIAM REID, K.C.B., was born on the
  25th of April, 1791: his father was         a Minister of the Established
 Church of Scotland,        at   Kinglassie,  in Fife, and with slight pre
 vious advantages of education, he was sent, soon after he entered his
 fifteenth year, to the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich.            Young
  Reid made rapid progress, completed his course of study before he
  had attained his eighteenth year, and was sent, as was at that time
  the custom, to the Ordnance Survey, then directed by Colonel Mudge,
  Royal Artillery: in February 1809, he was commissioned in the
  Royal Engineers.        In those stirring times the interval was short
  between the hall    of study and the field.     Lieutenant Reid joined the
  army of Wellington in 1810, was present at the first unsuccessful
  siege of Badajoz in      April 1811, and at the final capture of that
  fortress twelve months later.       Early and continuously conspicuous for
  his zeal, intelligence and energy,      even among the very many young
  officers  of Engineers who greatly distinguished themselves in that
                                                                2 O 2

                                                 544
            war, he took part, while yet a subaltern,          in the sieges of Ciudad
            Rodrigo, Burgos, and St. Sebastian, in each of which he was wounded,
            and in the battles of Salamanca, Vittoria, Nivelle, Nive, and Tou
            louse.     He did not obtain his Captaincy until 1814. He was pre
            sent at the bombardment of Algiers under Lord Exmouth in 1816 ;
            and he took an active part, twenty years later, in the operations of
            Sir de Lacy Evans in Spain, where he commanded the Engineers of
            the British auxiliary force.
                Ever ready, however,      as he was, to follow the leadings     of his own
            profession, his active mind was not less alive to its scienti<U+FB01>c interests.
                                                                  ‘                        ’
            He    was the contributor    of nine papers to the      Professional Papers
            of the Royal Engineers, usually on technical subjects; but some
            times on subjects, such as the movement of the shingle along our
            coasts,   which are more nearly related to his favourite studies.             It
            was   in 1832 that his mind <U+FB01>rst received the bias which he afterwards
            followed with so much distinction and success.              It fell to his lot,
            as the o<U+FB01>icer    of Engineers at Barbadoes, to have to re-establish the
            Government buildings blown down in the hurricane of the l0th of
            August,    1831:    no less than 1477 persons out of a population             of
            about 130,000 lost their lives on that occasion, and property to the
            value of more than £1,600,000 was destroyed.             The devastation and
            misery he witnessed, led him, in his own words,             “to search   every
            where for accounts of previous          storms, in the hope of learning
            something     of their   causes  and mode of action.”         In this he   was
            materially assisted     by the previous labours of      Mr. Red<U+FB01>eld of New
            York, who,    as early as 1831, had published in the      ‘
                                                                        American Journal
            of   Science’   the <U+FB01>rst of a numerous series of papers in which he
            demonstrated, not only that the storms of the American coast were
            whirlwinds,    in opposition to high authorities, who maintained that the
                          -~
            direction of the wind is rectilinear, but also traced some of them from
            the West Indies to the sea-board of the United States, and proved
            that they were progressive whirlwinds, moving forward on curved
            tracks with a considerable velocity.       Fully acknowledging his obliga
            tions to this great meteorologist, Lieut.-Colonel Reid set himself to
            con<U+FB01>rm and extend his deductions, by a laborious collation of the
            log-books of British men-of-war and merchantmen.               Impressed also
;III Ill 5! with the idea that to the south of the equator, “in accordance with
            the regularity nature follows in all her laws, storms would be found
             to move in   a  directly contrary direction,”   he endeavoured to collect

                                                         545
such facts as would aid further inquiry on that subject.                                                  None but
those who have attempted a like task can fully appreciate                                                     its   diffi
culties,—observations                which the investigator dare not reject, although
convinced that they are wrong, provoking silence where                                            a    word would
          up
clear     a        doubt,--still more provoking record                               of     useless details,            to
the omission         of    those that are important; nevertheless                                 he   persevered,
and, gaining confidence                in     the key           he   had obtained           to   the real nature
of    these intricate          phenomena,            he    ventured          in   1838       to   lay down, for
                                                                                                  it of
the guidance             of   the seaman, those broad general rules                                     navigation
which are known                as   the law     of   storms.           He showed that                   is   possible
to   deduce from the facts, rules applicable                            to   every emergency;                     to   tell
unerringly when ships must run before the hurricane, when they must
lie    to,          on   which tack,          so    as          avoid being taken aback                         by
                                                        to to

veering      of   the wind; lastly, how                    anticipate          its   coming changes, and
shape the course which best turns them                                  to   account.
     The announcement                 of   this law,            so   important         to   the mariner, and
to   every naval and commercial nation, was received with the greatest
interest       by    the scientific world;                  and Lieut.-Colonel Reid's work,
entitled      “An Attempt  develope the Laws
                                      to          Storms, has gone                 of
through several editions, and has been translated even into Chinese.
     Lieut.-Colonel Reid was appointed Governor                                      of   Bermuda          in   1839,
an    opportunity          which       he     did not fail             to   improve for pursuing his
inquiries:          he   was transferred           to    the Government                 of  the West Indies
in    1847.         Happening          at     the latter station                  to     entertain the late
Dr. Fownes          of    University College,                   he   induced that eminent chemist
               up
                                      of on
to    draw     a         treatise           rudimentary               chemistry for the use                     of     his
newly-founded             School              Practical Chemistry                    at Barbadoes:    this
treatise, which the author presented                             to   him,    he   first printed for local
use, then presented             to   Mr. Weale,           in    reference      to    a    design for       a    series
of   cheap popular treatises                   on   scientific subjects which                      he     had long
previously discussed with that gentleman.                                    It   was the parent                of   the
extensive and very valuable series                       of     rudimentary works since brought
out     by   Mr. Weale; but, with characteristic modesty,                                          he     requested
the suppression            of  a    notice     to   that        effect, which may                 be   seen   in     the
first edition       of
               Dr. Fownes's treatise. Resigning the government                                                          of
the West Indies,     grounds highly honourable
                               on                his sense    inde                   to                      of
pendence, Lieut.-Colonel Reid resumed his military duties, and was
serving      as   Commanding           Engineer           at    Woolwich when                 he   was selected

                                     546
for the difficult post of Chairman of the Executive Committee of the
Great Exhibition of 1851.      It  has been said that his singular     simpli
city of manner and total absence          of pretension   caused  the distin
guished men, with whom he was associated on that occasion, to
wonder at <U+FB01>rst what had led to his selection for the o<U+FB02>ice.              They
soon discovered, under that simplicity,        the patient but genuine en
thusiasm, the varied experience, the calm and even temper, and the
devotion to the duties of the moment, whatever they might be, which
eminently    <U+FB01>tted him for it.      It  is not too much to say that his
judicious arrangements contributed materially         to the success   of that
great undertaking,    and they were <U+FB01>tly rewarded by the ribbon of
 K.C.B., and his appointment to the important military command of
Malta. To that island Sir William Reid carried all the unostentatious
activity which had distinguished       his former governments.      In  a time
of extraordinary di<U+FB02>iculty, when Malta becoming an entreplit of the
<U+FB01>rst importance to the British Army in the East, all its resources
were strained to the utmost, he managed to meet every demand, and
while he restrained the political excitements of the day, to carry for
ward homely designs for the permanent bene<U+FB01>t of the people.              Thus
he founded a botanical school for the working classes; he imported
improved agricultural implements;          he introduced    a new species    of
the cotton plant, and other seeds adapted to the climate            ; he esta
blished barometers in public places to warn the Maltese <U+FB01>shermen of
impending gales;     he took in hand the Library of the old Knights
of Malta, and by the introduction of modern books, <U+FB01>tted it to be a
true public library for a large community.              Whatever attainable
practical object commended itself to his judgement, that be under
took, with the same quiet determination which in 1851 enabled him
to falsify adverse  predictions and attain the object to which he was
pledged, in the punctual opening of the Great Exhibition.
   The Government of Malta      was the last public service    of Sir William
Reid.     He returned home in        1858,   having    two years previously
attained the rank of Major-General,       and died after a very short illness
on the 31st of October.     He  was elected a    Fellow of the Royal Society
in 1839, and    was appointed Vice-President in 1849.
   Sir William Reid   was married to a daughter      of the late Mr. Bolland
of Clapham.      His wife died    a few months     before him, and he has
left <U+FB01>ve daughters.

  The author states that the principal object of this memoir is to
set forth two new methods of treating the dynamical equations by
processes  of variation of elements, differing from the ordinary pro
cesses of this nature principally in this particular, that the variations
are represented in explicit terms of the elements themselves and of
the time, and not through the medium                    of partial differential coeffi
cients.      It      has been his object to render the processes as elementary
as possible;            and to preserve them in a rigorous                 form, by      post
            to all
poning               attempts   at   approximation   until the formulae are actually
applied              practical problems.      The applications given            in   the paper
comprise the circular            and spherical pendulums, and the planetary
and    lunar theories, and            a   special theorem      as    to   the movement        of
the plane         of  a   planet's motion under the influence              of   several other
planets.

       From    these       formulae, the secular variations                              of     the elements are
  obtained without difficulty;                      and    a     new method                    of    integrating          the

  the author concludes that the ordinary direct methods                                                    of   solution

that, in the planetary theory, they produce results practically true
only on account of the minuteness of the disturbing forces, and the
consequent great length    of the secular periods; and that, in the
lunar theory, their failure is made evident, in consequence of the
comparatively large magnitude of the disturbing force, and the con
sequent rapidity with which the elements of the moon's orbit pass
through their secular periods.
  The formulae for the variations of the elements are then applied
to the lunar theory; and some of the integrations are effected
by means of a lemma containing the solution of the differential

     This part       of   the memoir               is   concluded          by   an   extension              of    the
general formulae for the tangential variation                              of   elements          to   the case
in   which we suppose the constant                        u     to   become variable, the result
being    to   add   to   each variation            a    term involving Bu.
     The third part            of   the Paper            contains the development                           of    the
method     of     osculating variation, before briefly described;                                from which
are deduced the formulae for the osculating variations                                     of     elliptic ele

ment takes        place, are found by means      of formula: of remarkable
simplicity. These three quantities may be ascertained once for all
for each planet (viz. the inclination of the <U+FB01>xed plane on which the
node moves to any coordinate plane, the longitude of the node of the
<U+FB01>xed plane in relation to any coordinate line, and the angular rate of
movement of the node of the orbit upon this <U+FB01>xed plane), and, when
once ascertained, may         be regarded as <U+FB01>xed elements       of the planet,
from which the position of the plane of its orbit can always be deter
mined without the use of tables.

     The subject of this communication forms part of a collection of
fossil remains from Australia, recently acquired by the British Mu
 seum, and demonstrates the former existence in that continent of a
 land-lizard     considerably surpassing in bulk the largest species now
 known.        The characters   are chie<U+FB02>y derived from vertebrae,     partially
 fossilized, equalling in size those of the largest existing Crocodiles;
 they are of the ‘procuelian’         type, but present lacertian modi<U+FB01>ca
 tions,     and closely agree    with those in the great existing ‘Lace
          ’
 lizard      of Australia (Hydrosaurus giganteus, Gray), of which indi
  viduals upwards of six feet long have been taken.          A  generic or sub
  generic distinction    is indicated by the comparatively contracted area
  of the neural canal, and by the inferior development of the neural
  spine, of the fossil vertebrae, which have belonged to an indivi
  dual not less than twenty feet in length, calculated from the vertebrae
  and proportions of the body of the existing Hydrosauri.             For this,
  probably extinct lizard, the name of lllegalania prisca is proposed.
      The results of    an extended series    of comparisons of its    vertebrae
  with those of recent and extinct Sauria       are  given; and the paper is
  illustrated   by drawings of the vertebrae      of Megalania and those of
  Hyd1'osaurus.

 sulphocarbanilide,                 which can be produced by a variety                                        of processes.
 The former is best prepared by the action of phosgene-gas on ani

    Joan    Foaar-:s Rovu-:, the only son of Capt. W. Boyle,       H.E.I.C.,
was born at Cawnpore in 1800       ;   educated at the High School, Edin
burgh, he was originally intended for the army, but whilst waiting
for an appointment to Addiscombe he studied medicine under Dr. A.
T.   Thomson, and from him derived, in great part, that love for natural
history which led him eventually to relinquish the profession of arms
and to adopt that of physic.          In 1822 he went out to India as an
Assistant-Surgeon     on the Bengal establishment, in charge of troops,
and the following     year was appointed     to the medical duties of the
station at Saharunpore,      together with the superintendence of the
 Company's     Botanical  Gardens at that place;     a post which he held
for nearly ten years.    Here he enjoyed ample opportunities for study
 ing the natural history of the Northern provinces, and employed all
 the time which he could spare from the active duties of his profes
 sion in collecting   specimens of plants, vegetable       productions,   and
 minerals; in amassing information of every kind bearing on the arts,
 commercial produce, and medicines of India; and in minutely ob
 serving the phenomena of tropical vegetation, as in<U+FB02>uenced by soil,
 climate, cultivation, and surrounding circumstances.
     Dr. Royle returned to England in l83l on furlough, bringing with
 him collections of great extent and value; and for several years was
 engaged in the study, examination, and arrangement of the materials
 he had collected, and in generalizing and digesting the facts he had
 observed.     The result of these labours was published      in 1839, in his
  “ Illustrations of the Botany and Natural History of the Himalaya
 Mountains and Cashmere,”      a work remarkable for the large amount       of
 useful and practical information which it contains      ;  including,  at the
  same   time, an elaborate systematic account of the botany of these
 parts of India, enlarged and comprehensive views of the climate of
 the country and the in<U+FB02>uences of meteorological        phenomena on its
 vegetation, and abundant and minute details of the various vegetable
 productions forming articles of export, or used in the arts and manu
 factures of the natives.  Especially valuable too, in a practical point of
 view, are the technical generalizations with which the work abounds ;
  in which the careful study of years is brought to bear on the econo
  mical production of cotton, tea, corn, and other similar substances         ;
 the exact laws of scienti<U+FB01>c research being employed to indicate new
  and improved methods of cultivation or production.

    In i837,     on the retirement of Dr. Paris as Professor of Materia
Medica in King’s College, London, Dr. Royle was elected to the
                                                      “ An
vacant chair ; on this occasion he published                 Essay on the An
tiquity of Hindoo Medicine,”        a work   of much   research,  and one alike
valuable to the medical man, the antiquary, and the philologist.                In
 1845 he brought out a
                             “ Manual of Materia Medica,”        as a text-book
for the students attending his lectures         at the College, which rapidly
passed through several editions both at home and abroad.
    A    special department of correspondence, relating to vegetable pro
 ductions, was founded at the East India House in 1838, and con<U+FB01>ded
 to Dr. Royle, and to the duties of this o<U+FB02>ice his best energies were
 devoted for nearly twenty years;           it  was an occupation     peculiarly
congenial to his taste and to the bent of his mind, as he was, to some
extent, able practically to carry out those views, which in the earlier
part of his life he had gradually deduced from scienti<U+FB01>c observations
and theoretical considerations.        In connexion with this office he pub
lished three valuable technical works on India; namely, in 1840,
 “ An Essay on the Productive Resources of India ;” in 1851, “ An
 Essay on the Cultivation of Cotton ;” and in 1855, “An Essay on
 the Cordage-Plants       and‘ Vegetable     Fibres  of India ;”    besides  nu
 merous smaller works and pamphlets on similar subjects.
    Dr. Royle      was a warm and active supporter          of industrial   exhi
 bitions.    Fully alive to their vast value and importance in a commercial
point of view, he was mainly instrumental            in obtaining from India
those extensive and valuable illustrations of Eastern arts and produce,
which excited so much interest at the great International Exhibitions
of   1851 and 1855     ; and at the time of his death he had just completed
 the formation and arrangement of a technical museum at the East
 India House, designed especially to exhibit the arts and productions

    Though chie<U+FB02>y known as a botanist, Dr. Royle was well-skilled in
 other branches of natural history, and was an active member of most
 of the societies devoted to them; at dilferent periods he <U+FB01>lled the
 duties of Secretary to the Geological and Horticultural Societies, and
repeatedly served on the Councils of the Royal and Linnean Societies.

     RICHARD          HoRsMAN SolI.Y, born in                              1778,       was educated and
took his       degree at Magdalen College,      Oxford; he entered for the Bar,

                as soon as he had been called to the
he became attached to scientific pursuits, joined most of the scientific
societies of London, and took an active interest in their management
and welfare.    He was one of the original promoters of the Royal
Institution in 1800, and during a period of more than forty years was
a constant attendant at                   its   meetings and                an   active member             of    its
committees.            He also took part               in    the formation              of   the Geological
and Horticultural Societies, serving repeatedly                                   in   the Council         of   the
latter    as   well   as   of   the Linnean Society.                   He was warm supporter

schemes      brought forward for perfecting that instrument, and seeking
by the offer of special prizes to call forth                          its   improvement           in   those

   THoMA's TookE, Esq. was the eldest son                                   of    the Rev.        William
Tooke,       F.R.S., author          of
                                      various literary works, and chaplain                             ofthe      .
English Factory            at   St. Petersburg. Thomas Tooke was born                              in   that
city    on   the 29th      of   February, 1774; and after undergoing                           a   general
education, entered early             in   life into active mercantile pursuits                     as   part
ner    in    one    of    the largest houses engaged                    in    the Russian              trade.
During this period, Mr. Tooke laid the foundation                                  of       that accurate
and surprising            knowledge        of    detail     in   connection with commerce
and political economy which enabled him                           to   raise, upon           so   wide and
solid   abasis, the economical doctrines and discoveries inseparably
associated with his name.
   These assumed            a   palpable form
                                      work which      published
                                                       in  a                           he                    in
 1823, entitled “Thoughts and Details      High and Low Prices,” on
the prelude    his great work “The History
                    to                        Prices,” the first two   of
volumes       of    which appeared          in   1838, the third and fourth                       in    1840
and 1847, and the two closing volumes,                           in   which       he   was assisted
                                                                                                             by
Mr. Newmarch,      1857.   in
  This remarkable work, evincing                       a    rare combination                 of   practical
wisdom, sound judgment, and great knowledge                                   of   commercial            sta
tistics, caused          the author       to     be   regarded        as
                                                                      a       most distinguished
writer       on    the science       of   political        economy.          The Royal Society
testified their sense           of his merits          by
                                                  electing him    Fellow      the a                 on
publication         of   his first work, and the French   Academy  more  recently
elected him         a   Corresponding       Member.
   Nor       were   Mr. Tooke's labours confined                      to    authorship.            He    was
an    active participator         in   the inquiries and legislation connected with
the social reforms           of   the last five-and-twenty years.                      He took     a    lead
ing part       in    the Factory Worker's Commission, and was the                                   Chair
man     of   the Commission for investigating the difficult subject                                 of      the
employment           of   children.        For   a    long period           he    presided over the
Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation and the St. Katharine's
Dock Company; and was one       the founders          of
                                               the Statistical                    of

                                   551
Society, in which he took great interest.        Mr. Tooke    was also one
of the early promoters of the London and Birmingham Railway;
and the celebrated Merchants’       Petition in favour of Free Trade
emanated from him.         At that period (l82l), he projected and
founded the Political Economy Club, which still exists.
   Thus, the active sphere occupied by Mr. Tooke          was   of scarcely
less importance than his pursuits as    a philosopher, and his name will
be always associated with the great social improvements of this cen
tury,  as for nearly  <U+FB01>fty years he applied his high mind and great
acquirements to purposes      of practical legislation, which have been
conducive of much public good.       Mr. Tooke died at his residence,
3! Spring Gardens, on the 26th of February, 1858, in his 84th
year; and it was only within the last few months prior to his de
cease, that be manifested very sensibly the decay     of powers generally
incident to his extreme age.
   BENJAMIN Taavaas, Esq.—'l‘his eminent surgeon was born in
London, on the 3rd of April, 1783, so that he was ten years old
when   John Hunter died. In his sixteenth year he betook himself to
the great Hospital School of Anatomy and Surgery in the Borough,
then superintended by the elder Cline and Astley Cooper.
   In the year   1800 he was apprenticed to     Sir Astley at  Guy’s Hos
pital.   This connection at once secured for him all the advantages
and best privileges of a student’s life.   His career   was early marked
by great ardour and diligence, and a sojourn at Edinburgh during the
Session 1806-7 (after passing his examination at the London College),
was always spoken of by him, as a period of unbounded delight, and
keen interest, in all that pertained to the prosecution of his medical
studies.    Here he formed many lasting friendships; and the         names
of Thomson, Barclay,      and Gordon, amongst others, might        be men
tioned as being descriptive     of the eminent men whose society he
more especially sought and appreciated at this important epoch of his
educational career.
   On his return to London he quickly gathered about him a large
class of pupils to attend the anatomical demonstrations which he
delivered at Guy’s Hospital, and in this practice he persevered         for
several successive  seasons.
   Mr. Travers obtained no professional employment until the year

                                          552
     1809, when he was appointed to the lucrative post-of Surgeon to the
    East India Company’s Volunteer Corps. This piece of good fortune
    at once determined the aspect of his future life.           He was a man of
    great natural endowment, to which was added the charm of manners,
    to say nothing     of an exquisite tact and great tenderness        in dealing
    with the misfortunes        of others.    It  is well known    that for these
    reasons    Mr. Travers   was always held     in the highest  esteem, both by
    the profession and the public.
        In   1810, on the death of      Mr. Saunders, Mr. Travers joined Dr.
    Farre at the Eye In<U+FB01>rmary in Charterhouse Square. This appoint
    ment speedily brought with it a great accession of private business.
    To this connection     the profession is indebted for one   of Mr. Travers’s
    earliest and most popular works,        “The Synopsis of Diseases of the
    Eye.”      This book speedily ran through three editions, besides being
    republished in America, and translated into Italian by Dr. Apolloni,
    a physician of Pisa.       It possesses the great merit of being founded
    on original     observation, and was     long held    in much regard      as a
    Text-Book, though       since   superseded by larger and more ambitious
    publications.
        No Hospital Surgeon ever attained a wider or more justly-deserved
    reputation for a profound knowledge of eye-disease than the subject
    of this notice.     His papers on Cataract in the Medico-Chirugical
    Transactions,    and the treatise above mentioned, were received at the
    time    as  masterpieces of accurate symptomatology;          they abound in
    new facts,    and form an elegant and comprehensive digest of all that
    was then known touching various important           points of practice.
        At the time of Mr. Travers’s appointment to the office of Surgeon
    to St. Thomas’s Hospital in 1815, the post was one of extreme inde
    pendence, and the <U+FB01>eld of observation has at all times been very ex
    tensive.
        So long as his health lasted,      Mr. Travers availed himself of this
    splendid opportunity to its fullest extent, and we soon <U+FB01>nd him asso
    ciated in the surgical course with         his great colleague and former
    master Sir Astley Cooper, then in the zenith of his fame        as an operator
    and a lecturer on Surgery.      Mr. Travers, unfortunately,   soon found that
    his bodily vigour was not such as would enable him to maintain his post
    as a lecturer ; he was one     night carried from the Theatre in a fainting
    fit, from which for some     time it remained doubtful whether he would

                                        553
 ever rally. He    th_us felt himself most reluctantly compelled to forego
one   of the great and early objects of his ambition, but in compensa
tion for this   it may   be remarked,     that had be retained his post as
Sir Astley’s colleague in the Surgical Chair, he probably never would
have penned the “ Treatise on Constitutional Irritation,” a production,
which has long since secured for its author a European reputation.
   Early in this century, Dr. Jones had explained the operation of               a
single ligature upon the coats of an artery, and dispelled the obscurity
which had gathered round this question. There were, however, some
material points of doubt and discussion still remaining to be dealt with.
These the subject of our memoir <U+FB01>nally and completely elucidated by
experiment, so that the causes of secondary hemorrhage are now well
ascertained, and are far more effectually guarded against than was the
case before the appearance       of Mr. Travers’s papers in the fourth and
ninth volumes of the “Medico-Chirurgical Transactions.” It was after
his appointment to St. Thomas’s          that he perfected this inquiry, by
proving, on the person of a patient under his own care, that a ligature
may be withdrawn <U+FB01>fty hours after its application, without risk, and
successfully, so far as concerns the obliteration           of the trunk of the
brachial artery.      A  similar result was obtained after tying the carotid
in the horse and ass, although        the ligature was removed so early as
twelve or even nine hours after its original             application.    On  one
occasion    Mr. T. removed      a ligature      from the femoral artery of a
man twenty-seven hours after tying that vessel for a popliteal aneu
rism, but here pulsation returned and the experiment failed.                This
suggestion, or rather the discovery of these effects of the temporary
use  of ligatures,  was entirely original,    as well as the announcement      of
another new fact, to which we shall now make some allusion.
   In   1811   Mr. T. communicated        to the     Royal Society    an account
of  some    experiments which       exhibit    the means     adopted by nature
for the cure of wounded intestines.             This paper was accepted for
publication,   but  it was  withdrawn to form the groundwork of a larger
treatise, published in 1812, which was most favourably received by the
profession.     It is there proved that     if the  intestine of a dog he stran
gulated by a single ligature, the ulcerative in<U+FB02>ammation provides for
the escape of the thread into the cavity of the bowel; nature at the
same time restoring the wall       of the gut by     a deposit  of lymph, which
undergoes a rapid organization.         Of the great work      on Constitutional

                                                   554
Irritation, we have little more to say in the brief space assigned to us,
than that it is truly “the work of a master.”         It consists of two
parts: the first contains an account of the direct effects of local irri
tation upon the great centres of life; the heart, the brain, and nervous
system. The second is a more elaborate production:                                    it embraces a re
view of       all   those obscure relations between parts and centres respect
ively, which the author terms “reflected,” wherein the latter are not
abruptly       roused
                               to
                               a      direct response and sympathy with the local
excitement, but where the action passes on, via the system,                                          to    some
other tissue            or   organ     of   the body,

centres directly             to   the offending part,            as   shown      by   the specific form
             of                                                  the most profound portion

     Mr. Travers contributed largely                    to   the best periodical literature                      of
his time.         These productions are for the most part                           to   be   found       in   the
earlier volumes           of   the “Medico-ChirurgicalTransactions,” normustwe
omit    to   mention that his first paper narrates the success                                  of   an   opera
tion performed for the cure                  of   a   remarkable           aneurismal tumor.                   On
this occasion Mr.              T.   tried the common carotid artery.                            The woman
perfectly         recovered.  At that time this operation had only once
before been         performed successfully                 by
                                            Sir Astley Cooper. The two
papers       on    Malignant Disease, and               a       small theoretical discourse                      on
Syphilis, must not pass without praiseworthy mention,                                      to   say nothing
of   his last work             on   Inflammation,       a    crowning effort, worthy                  of     this
great disciple          of   Hunter.
     Mr. Travers             in   early life was   a   very good operator.           He was still
young when           he   first held the Surgeoncy              to   the Eye-Infirmary. He used
tosay that        a   man who can extract the cataract with tolerable success
can    do   anything with the knife.                   Add       to    this, that from        a   very early
period       he   was    in   the daily habit         of   cutting down upon arteries, and
performing other hazardous experiments upon living animals, which
must also have contributed                   to   give him readiness and dexterity                          as   an
operating Surgeon.
     He lived        to   achieve all the honours of the race set before him.
He    was twice President               of   the College             of   Surgeons, and had long

passed the Chair at the Medical and Chirurgical and the Hunterian
Societies, in addition to the reward finally bestowed by Her Majesty,
of creating him one of her Sergeant-Surgeons a few months before his
death.    He died somewhat suddenly, after having suffered from pro
longed illness, at his residence, No 54, Green Street, Grosvenor-square,
on the 6th            of March, 1858.
     In   manner and personal appearance he was eminently refined and
gentlemanlike.                  Of such men we may say, with the younger Pliny,

     HENRY WARBURToN, Esq. was the son of                                       a   London merchant,
and was himself for a time engaged in business.   He had, however,
passed through a distinguished career at Cambridge, and being pos
sessed       of sufficient fortune, he exchanged the pursuit of commerce
for science, literature, and politics.  He entered Parliament in
1826, and finally retired from it in 1847. The course he usually
took               of the legislature is well known, and among va

need here only specify, as connected with science, his Chairmanship

sity, now the University College, and for many years was                                      a     Member
of    its
      Council.               He was also           an
                                            original Member      the Senate           of                     of

1843 and              1844, filled the office              of    President.           He died          at   his
house       in   Cadogan-place,             on   the      16th      of   September,        1858,       at   the
age    of    seventy-three.

with unpalatable propositions, committed his thoughts to           a friend to
be digested and presented to the Cambridge           Philosophical Society,
from nothing but timidity at the idea of appearing in person.              But
by the time the paper     was drawn up and     publicly read, the real author
took heart    of grace,  and drew up his own thoughts with additions.
This paper “ On the Partition of Numbers, and on Permutations and
Combinations,” was printed by the Cambridge Society in 184 7. An
other,   “On Self-Repeating       Series,”   was published   in 1854.    Both
papers show a great command over the German factorial notation,
and add several curious theorems to their subjects.
    Jonaunns Miinnna was born in the city of Coblentz, on the 14th
of July, 1801. His father, Matthias Miiller, was a shoemaker, in
a small way of business, but, notwithstanding             his narrow means,
determined not to deny his son the advantages of a good education.
Accordingly, after such tuition       as was suited to his earlier years,   the
boy, in 1810, entered the secondary school or gymnasium of his na
tive town, where for eight years he was instructed in classics, mathe
matics, and other branches of liberal learning.            His rather mono
 tonous life at this institution,   which is said to have been carried on
 in  an old-fashioned    scholastic way, was relieved, and his mind ex
 panded, by independent reading, especially of Goethe, and by fre
quent rambles in the country,           in which  he grati<U+FB01>ed     his love of
external nature, and collected plants and animals, for the study of
which he showed an early predilection.
    At the recommendation of the Director of Schools of the pro
vince, Johannes Schultze, who had doubtless noted the intellectual
promise of the youth, Matthias          Miiller had destined his     son for a
learned profession;     and although      he did not live to   see  the ful<U+FB01>l
ment of his intentions, they were dutifully carried out by his widow.
Accordingly in 1819 young Miiller was sent to the University of
Bonn, having in the mean time, after leaving the gymnasium, gone
through    a year’s  military   service,  as was the custom    with those of
his age and condition.
    Before entering on his university course, the young man had an
important question to settle.       Born of Roman Catholic parents and
nurtured in the same       faith, he had when yet a child manifested a
 desire to be brought up for the priesthood, and this inclination          had
 been fondly cherished by his pious and affectionate mother.              The

                                                        557
time had now come for choosing his path; and we are told that                                                   it
was after three days of anxious communing                                     with himself that he
gave up thoughts of the Church, and decided for Medicine.
   He remained three years at Bonn, and took his degree of Doctor
in December, 1822; having presented an inaugural dissertation on
the laws of animal locomotion*, a subject on which he had already
published some observations in ‘Oken’s Isis.    His career at the
university was characterized by intense application to study, but
with the constant exercise of independent thought, and by a keen
relish for original investigation.                          Prompted        by this, though but in
the first year of his studies, he engaged in a series of experiments
and observations on the respiration of the                             foetus, a subject which had
been proposed               for
                              a    prize question            by   the university; and               his   essayt,
distinguished          alike           by   learned research and              by    original and varied
experiment,          was declared the                   successful one.             Müller's scientific
tendencies        at   this period may                 be   also inferred from the fact that                   he
acted    as   secretary           ofNatural History Society established among
                                       a
the students           at   Bonn, by Nees von Esenbeck.
   But while thus intent                      on     the proper       work     of   a     student, Müller
was not indifferent                to   the general yearning after constitutional                            free
dom, which, after expulsion                           of
                                the French, pervaded the liberal
mind     Germany; and we are told that
         of                                   heartily joined the            he
Burschenschaft, and even took part     leader  that rather enthu
                                                                 as
                                                                 a             in
siastic association,              in   which, notwithstanding               the ban       of   the Carlsbad
decrees, the academic youth still cherished their hopes                                          of   German
unity, and laid plans for social improvement.
  After taking his                 degree,        Müller went         to   Berlin    to   pass his exami
nations for licence               to   practise (Staatsprüfungen),                  and continued for
year and      a   half      to    prosecute his philosophical                 and medical studies              in a
that university.              He had not gone through his career                        at    Bonn without
                                                  the “Naturphilosophie”
                                            of of
contracting         some leaven                                                           with which the
leading German schools                              biology were then fermenting.       Of this
however        he   was radically cleared                   at Berlin, through the influence                   of
Rudolphi,                              he                   favourite pupil.  Rudolphi was
                                                                                                               to on an

enemy     to   subjective speculation                    in   biological science;              he   looked
the so-called philosophy                     as     mistaken and futile            in   its   application

structure.      Of   the encouragement            and aid received from that ex
cellent man, Miiller afterwards spoke in the most grateful terms, and
he declares that it was through the in<U+FB02>uence and example of Rudol
phi that his scienti<U+FB01>c pursuits were afterwards turned                   so much   to
comparative anatomy.
   Miiller returned to Bonn in 1824, and in October of the                same year
began his career as an academical lecturer in that university.              In   1826
he was made        Professor Extraordinary.           In the meantime, however,
the duties he imposed on himself as a teacher had been unusually
onerous, and to these was added unremitting                 employment in original
investigation, with all its concomitant labour and thought.              Such over
strained exertion brought on a state of bodily exhaustion and mental
depression, which in 1827 obliged him wholly to lay aside work for
a season, and to seek         for health and recreation in       a journey up the
Rhine, and through the south of Germany, in which he was accom
panied by his newly-married          Returning with recruited health,
                                     wife.
and resuming his duties in Bonn, he was in 1830 promoted to the
grade of Professor in Ordinary; and in the spring of 1833 he was called
to occupy the chair of Anatomy and Physiology in Berlin, which had
become vacant by the death of his friend and preceptor, Rudolphi.
   Of the works published by Miiller during his stay at Bonn, the
<U+FB01>rst in point of time was one “ On the Comparative Physiology of
Vision,” which appeared in           1826    *.    This   was immediately followed
by a smaller essay   “On the Phantasmal Phenomena of Vision1-,” a
class   of phenomena which had greatly interested and attracted Miiller
when a boy, and in the contemplation of which,                   as he   himself in
forms us, he used to give free play to his fancy.                The   appearances,
thus become      early familiar to him, he subjected in maturer years to
philosophical     scrutiny,      and the work in which they are described
and discussed forms properly the continuation of the larger treatise
on vision which preceded it.           Of     this treatise, the leading charac

    In an           “ On the
            essay                Development of the Reproductive Organs,"
which appeared a few years later*, Miiller traced the steps of that
process in the embryo of man and animals, detected the minute pri
mordial <U+FB01>lament (now known by his name) which gives rise to the
oviduct or Fallopian tube, and applied with much success the know
ledge thus acquired to the elucidation of certain perplexing malforma
tions which sometimes occur. Pursuing his researches into the intimate
structure     and development of organs, he was able about the same
time to produce his treatise on the secreting glands-f.                 In this well
known work the intimate structure of the organs in question is inves
tigated in the varied conditions which it presents, from the lowest
animals to man, and from the embryonic to the perfect state;                      and
one great result of this labour was to establish, on a wider and more
satisfactory basis, the true doctrine of the relation of the blood-vessels
and gland-ducts,         as <U+FB01>rst    correctly conceived by Malpighi.           It was
also shown       that the same kind of secretion might be yielded by
glands formed, as far as discoverable, on an entirely diiferent type                of
construction.       It  was at this time, also, that     Miiller, almost simulta
neously with Panizza of Pavia, made the discovery of the lymphatic
hearts in reptiles     ; a discovery, which especially deserves notice on the
present occasion, inasmuch as it was communicated to this Society
and published in the
                              “ Philosophical
                                                  Transactionsi.”
    When he settled in Berlin, Miiller’s <U+FB01>rst                care, next to his    pro
 fessorial duties, was the continuation and completion of his
                                                                             “ Hand
book of Physiology,” commenced before he left Bonn. Appearing
in successive parts, the book was at length <U+FB01>nished in 1840.
    To this important work,          so well and favourably known to          English
 readers through the admirable translation               of Dr. Baly, it is unne
 cessary here to make long reference.              With defects of construction
 which detract from its usefulness           as a systematic guide to the student

prodigious learning and elaborate <U+FB01>nish of that stupendous work,
which occupied its author for the greater part of                  a long life,——Miiller’s
“ Handbook”         was        accepted, we may almost                 say, with universal
accord, as the most valuable general work on physiology which had
appeared in the long interval since Haller’s time.                               And, indeed,
the two      great physiological          writers     have much in common.                         In
both, we perceive the same earnest                 purpose of placing the doctrines
of physiology       on a basis of fact, the same constant endeavour to
extend and consolidate this foundation, or test its validity, by ma
terials and methods placed at their command by their accomplish
ment in the cognate and collateral sciences.                      Anatomy,         human and
comparative, experiments             on animals, chemistry,              and physical          sci
ence,  in its various departments, are all brought to bear in the inves
tigation of physiological truth.
   Mii1ler’s work        is,   moreover, enriched throughout with the fruits of
the author’s       own observation and experimental inquiry, which are
sometimes,    it   is   true, given with      a    detail better suited for         a   separate
memoir than for         a   chapter in   a   handbook, but which signally enhance
its value as an original source of information.                    Almost every part of
the book affords evidence of this, but                it   is   enough to refer specially
to the examination of the blood, the disquisitions                           on the nervous
System,    and the valuable experimental                investigations           on the voice
and hearing.        Here, as in his other writings,                it   is   characteristic        of
Miiller that he takes nothing on trust; every statement, whether
of matter of fact or doctrine,   thoroughly sifted.
                                              is     Di<U+FB01>iculties,
however perplexing, are never evaded or slurred over                         ;   defects,    how
ever    they may deface the picture                to be presented, are never dis
guised.    Every question          is   resolutely attacked;           the result, whether
success or failure,      is    honestly told;      and there      is   no yielding          to the
temptation,    so powerful         with writers of systems, of rounding                      off   a
rugged subject with smooth plausibilities.
   While carrying on his experimental inquiries in physiology, Miiller
did not neglect the study of pathological anatomy, and he was one
of the <U+FB01>rst to apply the microscope to the study of morbid growths                             *;

 still his chief pursuit to the end of his life was comparative anatomy,
 with occasional excursions into the neighbouring fields of zoology
 and palaeontology.     Fishes and marine invertebrata were his favourite
 subjects.    The chief fruits of his inquiries were—his memoirs on the
 myxinoid fishes; his systematic description (in association with Henle)
of the Plagiostomata; the reintroduction into zoology of the pla
centiferous shark of Aristotle; his essay on the Ganoids and on the
natural arrangement of fishes; his papers on Rhizopoda; and his
remarkable succession of memoirs on the embryology and structure
of the Echinoderms.        It will not have been forgotten by the Fellows
of this   Society, that for the last-mentioned    discoveries in particular,
in addition to his previous labours in physiology and comparative
anatomy, Professor Müller received the Copley Medal in 1854.
   Of   the memoirs on the myxinoid fishes, we may observe, in the
language of the President’s address on the occasion mentioned, that
their title conveys but a faint idea of their scope and importance;
for while the anatomy of a particular family of fishes may be said to
form the text, there is   an ample commentary,     rich in new and original
matter, in which the structure is compared in other tribes, and the
facts   sagaciously   applied  to the elucidation     of great questions in
animal morphology.         Referring   to the researches    on the  Echino
dermata, the President thus continued:—“Professor Müller early
applied himself to the study of the structure and economy of the
Echinoderms. After describing, in a special memoir, the anatomy of
the Pentacrinus, so interesting as a living representative of the ex
tinct Crinoidea, and publishing, in conjunction with        M. Troschel,   a
systematic    arrangement and description      of the Asterida,  he was at
length happily led to investigate the embryo life of this remarkable
class of animals.      The field of inquiry on which he entered had
scarcely been trenched upon before, and he has since made         it almost
wholly his own by persevering researches carried on at the proper
seasons   for the last nine years, on the shores of the North      Sea, the
Mediterranean, and the Adriatic.         In this way he has investigated
the larval conditions of four out of the five orders of true Echino
derms, and has successfully sought out and determined the common
plan followed in their development, amidst remarkable and unlooked
for deviations in the larval organization and habits of genera even of
the same order; and his inquiries respecting these animals have

                                     562
made us acquainted with larval forms, with relations between the
larva and future being; and with modes of existence         ; such as nature
has not yet been found to present in any other part of the animal
kingdom.      Finally, with the light thus derived from the study of
their development, Professor Miiller has subjected the organization
of the entire class of Echinoderms, both recent and fossil, to a
thorough revision, and has added much that is new, as well as cleared
up much that was obscure, in regard to their economy, structure, and
homologies.      It is to these researches,   which occupy seven memoirs
        ‘
 in the Transactions of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin,’ that
 more special reference is made in the award of the Medal.           Besides
their other claims to distinction, they may be justly regarded as
revealing a new order of facts in the history of animal development.”
    Soon after his settlement in Berlin,   Miiller established the “ Archiv
fiir Anatomic und Physiologic,” which goes by his name ; and he con
tinued the publication till the time of his death. Besides containing
numerous original contributions       of his own, and the valuable Annual
 Reports on the progress of these sciences,       drawn up by himself or
his able assistants, this Journal, following after “ Meckel’s Archives,”
 has formed the principal medium of publicity for the labours of the
 leading physiologists of Germany during the period of its existence        ;
 and the establishment and continued superintendence of it by Miiller,
 in the midst of other laborious employments, must          be ever regarded
 as an important    service rendered to science.
    What remains of Miiller’s personal history may be soon told.
Only two events, so far as we know, after this time broke in upon
the even tenour of his life.     In 1848 he was Rector of the University,
in  a time of civil commotion, when political agitation distracted the
academic body, and both students and professors left the lecture
room to equip themselves as soldiers.            Miiller, who in youth had
been an ardent “ Bursch,”        was now a   sober conservative, and in his
mind the    aspect   of affairs threatened disaster to the State and the
 University.    His situation    was   one  of di<U+FB02>iculty and not without
peril; he strove manfully to maintain authority, though with little
success; but even those who took a different view of passing events
paid a willing tribute     to his honesty    of purpose and the personal
courage he displayed        in most trying circumstances.         The other
 remarkable occurrence in Miiller’s latter years was the following.

                                                        563
 He was accustomed                  to spend his autumn vacation somewhere on the
 sea-coast, for the sake of studying                          marine animals.                  While he was
 returning from one of these visits which he had made in 1855 to
 the coast of Norway with two of his pupils, the steamer, between
 Bergen and Christiansand, in which he was travelling, was run into
 by another, and speedily sank. Nearly fifty people lost their lives,
 and among them one of Müller's companions, a young man of great
 promise.   In a letter to a friend in England, in which Müller gives
 an account of this deplorable calamity, he says that on finding him
 self in the water, he at first kept himself up by swimming; but
 that having his clothes on, he soon became exhausted, and would
 have inevitably perished, had he not caught hold of a ship's ladder
that was floating by. He held on for a long time, and had given
up     all
      hope              of
                succour, when was picked            he
                                                   boat from the                up   by
                                                                                     a
other      vessel.       His remaining companion, Dr. Schneider,                                saved    him
self   in    a   similar way.          This      event had      a   deep effect upon him, and,
although           he   still resorted      to     the sea-side,           he   dreaded afterwards             to
trust himself            on   ship-board.
   Still working hard                 as   before, but with altered spirits,                       of he     the
spring     1858 began
             of                        to   fail    in   health;           he   complained            in head
aches and passed sleepless nights, owing, doubtless,    recurrence                        to   a
of cerebral disease from which he had twice before suffered    the                                      in
course       of   his life.     Experiencing            no   amendment, and            at   length feeling
that his end was approaching,      settled his affairs both public and
                                                    he
private; called his son                     by
                              telegraph from Bonn          the 27th                    on                     of
April, and fixed               on   the morrow for            a   medical consultation                  on   his
case; but the next morning found him     corpse.                a
    Aman of Müller's eminence had of course been enrolled                                       a      member
of   the chief learned bodies               of   Europe and America.                   He was elected
    Foreign Member              of   the Royal Society
                                                                  in in

     The President,           on taking    the Chair, addressed the Meeting             as
follows     :—
       GENTLEMEN,
ALTHOUGH           I have     already had the opportunity of offering to you my
thanks for the great honour which you have conferred on me in placing
me    in this Chair, it is but <U+FB01>t that            I   should repeat them now, when
we    are assembled in a more formal manner,                          and when probably
some       Fellows are present who were not present at the Anniversary
dinner.       It   is impossible      that   I    should be otherwise than highly
grati<U+FB01>ed      by such an expression of the good opinion                    of   a Society,
which may justly              be regarded    as    including   a larger    proportion   of
individuals        distinguished      for their knowledge         and intelligence than
any other in this country.                At the      same time   I   must own that my
feelings on the occasion are somewhat modi<U+FB01>ed when                          I   see around
me so many of our Fellows who have devoted their lives to scienti<U+FB01>c
pursuits, and who in their respective departments have contributed
so much       more than         I   have done to the advancement of scienti<U+FB01>c
knowledge.          It   is now long since the requirements                of   an arduous
profession, and the public not less than the private duties belonging
to   it,
      compelled me to direct my attention to other objects, and in                       a
great degree to relinquish those researches, to which during many

                                                 565
previous years         I   had been able to devote a large portion                 of my time,
and which were to            me the      chief objects of interest during the early
period      of my life.      Still, although       I   have ceased, except to a limited
extent, to be a labourer in that field of science in which                            I laboured
formerly,      I   have never failed to sympathize with those who in this
respect were more happily situated, and to regard with satisfaction,
or   I ought       rather to say with admiration, the grand results at which
they have arrived in extending the boundaries of human knowledge.
     If it were possible
                    for any one of that small but illustrious band of
philosophers, -who just two centuries ago were associated in Gresham
College for the purpose of mutually communicating and receiving
knowledge, and who there laid the foundation of the Society which is
now assembled—to revisit the scene of his former labours, we may well
conceive the delight which               it would afford him        to learn that the           suc
cess   of   that noble enterprise had been so much greater than his most
sanguine aspirations           could have led him to anticipate.                       Not only
would he find an ample development of sciences which were then in
the embryo state           of their existence, but he would find other                  sciences,
not inferior to these in interest and importance, added to the list.
He would find that, instead of a limited number of individuals who
were then occupied with scientific inquiries, whose labours were held
in little estimation by the general public, and even held to be objects
of ridicule by the presumptuous and ignorant, there is now a large
number devoted to the               same pursuits,        and successfully applying to
them the highest powers of the human intellect. He would perceive
that, instead of being confined as it were to a corner, the love of
knowledge  is gradually becoming extended throughout the length
and breadth of the land; and that, of those whose position does not
afford them the opportunity               of penetrating to the inmost             recesses      of
the temple of science, there are many who, having advanced as far as
the vestibule, are enabled even there to obtain their reward, in the
improvement of their own minds, and in being rendered more useful
members       of the community.
     Now, to say that         all

far-distant times, the course             of   events led the ancient nations, first
Greece and afterwards               of   Rome,    to   the cultivation   of   literature,

 moral philosophy, of geometry, and of the <U+FB01>ne arts; so in these latter
 times, the course of events, taking another direction, has led the nations
 of Europe to the investigation of the physical sciences.         The Royal
 Society has been one of the results of this movement ; but being once
 established it became itself a cause, and has been a most powerful
 and e<U+FB01>icient instrument for the carrying on, and giving a right direc
 tion to, the movement in which it had itself originated.        It has been
 the means of bringing       those who have the same objects in view into
 communication with each other; and we all know how the interchange
 of knowledge and opinions, and the spirit of emulation, tend, at the
 same time that they increase the energy and activity of the imagina
 tion, to correct and mature the judgment.          Nor should  we overlook
 the fact, that the institution of the Royal Society has always afforded
 an honourable     distinction   for those whose labours have contributed
 to build up the fabric of human knowledge;-—a distinction which has
 this peculiarity,   that it can never be obtained through         favour or
 interest, while the selection of candidates for the Fellowship is as
 carefully and impartially     conducted as is the case at present.
    Among the portraits which we          see around us is one of the Sove
 reign who granted us the charter by which we are incorporated, and
 who conferred the title of Royal Society on us.           Whatever   defects
 posterity may have discovered        in the character of King Charles the
 Second, we are bound to express our obligations to him, not only for
 the charter which     We  bold, but for the real interest which he seems
to have taken in our Society when it was yet in its infancy, and for
the attention which he paid to it during the early period of his reign,
at a time when the patronage       of the Crown   was of so much the greater
importance,    as there were      but few among the public who sympa
thized with the new association in its pursuits, or were capable of
estimating the objects for which it was established.        Nor did His Ma
jesty merely grant us a charter, but it was one especially suited to the
genius and character of the English people. When nearly forty years
afterwards the Académie des Sciences was founded by King Louis the
Fourteenth, it was placed wholly under the dominion of the Crown.
The number of its members        was limited  : those belonging to one of its
sections received pensions from the State;          and when a vacancy oc
curred in any of the sections, it was necessary that the election of the
 new member should be con<U+FB01>rmed by the Crown.               Now we must not

                                                                    567
find fault with the constitution of a Society which has earned for
itself so lofty a reputation; including in the list of members the                                           its
names     of   the most profound                           philosophers,                  and the greatest geniuses
of   the age, and            of   whose works                       all   who are engaged                   in    the pursuit        of
knowledge are justly proud; but                                           we   cannot doubt that with                      us   such
a   constitution,            so    different from that                           of    every other corporation                       in
this country, would have been very much less successful than that
which     we
           actually possess. The charter the Royal Society leaves                     of
the management                    of    its   affairs entirely                   in    the hands              of   the Fellows,
without the interference                       of    any higher power.                             No one,          in   virtue      of
his belonging            to      it,   receives         any pension                  or   derives any other advan
tage from the Government, and our funds are supplied altogether by
ourselves.          The sum              of   £1000, for some time past, has                                        been    annu
ally voted         by   Parliament             for the promotion                           of      science.       The Royal
Society have undertaken the task                                          of   suggesting           to      the Treasury the
manner        in   which this may                      be       most usefully and economically                              distri
buted, the duty                  of    accomplishing                      this object being devolved                            on   a
committee specially appointed for that purpose.                                                       But from this             Par

instances,     to   render good service                               to   the community; while,                           on    the
other hand, they are indebted                                  to   the Government, first, for the                          apart
ments    in   Somerset House, formerly allotted                                            to   them         by    King George

  the Third, and now for the more ample accommodation                granted to
  them by Her present Majesty.
      When the Royal Society was <U+FB01>rst established, there was no other
  Society devoting itself to the pursuit of any branch of knowledge;
  and hence it was that many communications            were made on subjects
  not strictly belonging     to those sciences,    to which   it  was intended
  that their attention should be more especially directed.           If we refer
  to   their earlier publications, we <U+FB01>nd in one of them a scheme for a
  universal alphabet; in another, a dissertation on the Chinese lan
  guage.       Father Gaubil,    a missionary    belonging   to the order     of
  Jesuits,   sends them a map      of Pekin, with an exact account of the
  imperial palace.     An English merchant gives a history of his journey
  to   Aleppo and Tadmor; others describe the discovery of tessellated
"
  pavements and other Roman antiquities.            In short, there is scarcely
  any one    department of knowledge, whether it be philology, history,
  antiquities, _medicine, geography, political economy, and even meta
  physics, which is not to a greater or less extent represented in the
  Philosophical Transactions.        But all this time knowledge of all kinds
  was    rapidly increasing, vires acquirens eumlo. The time arrived
  when a division of labour was required, and the Royal Society disco
  vered the necessity of con<U+FB01>ning       themselves to their more legitimate
  pursuits.     In the year    1717 the   institution of the Society of Anti
  quaries attracted     one   large class of communications from them.
  After an interval of seventy years, the Linnean Society was founded
  for the cultivation‘ of natural history; and I need not enumerate the
  various other societies which have been since called into existence,
  and which are now pursuing         their course, not  as rivals  of the Royal
   Society, but as cooperators with        it in the great work of exploring
  the phenomena of the universe.           Whatever may have been the ap
  prehensions which some may have entertained formerly,               the event
  has proved that these new institutions         have in no degree interfered
  with the reputation and usefulness of that from which they derived
  their origin.     Indeed, without such fellow-labourers as these it is
  dif<U+FB01>cult to understand how, in the present state of knowledge, the
  Royal Society could have met the expectations of the scienti<U+FB01>c por
   tion of the community.       There would have been no means of record
   ing   a vast number    of valuable details, from which important         con
    clusions may be drawn in after-times.         At the  same time, we need

only refer to the volumes of the Philosophical Transactions, published
since the beginning             of this century,          to be satis<U+FB01>ed that the disposi
tion to communicate the higher                   class     of investigations to the Royal
Society is not less than formerly.                  It     is,
                                                             indeed, the interest of every
one who       is   ambitious that his name as                a   discoverer should be trans
mitted to posterity, that his works should have                         a   place in the Philo
sophical Transactions,            where, as has been observed by                   a   writer in the
Edinburgh Review,
                  “ He                  has the bene<U+FB01>t           of the great      name acquired
by that distinguished             body, by the labours of Newton                        and Halley
and Cavendish, and               by   two centuries of constant services performed
to the commonwealth of letters*.”
   With the exception of the achievements of those small communities
of ancient Greece, to whose works                 we     still refer   as affording the highest
standard of excellence in literature and the <U+FB01>ne arts, and from whom
has been transmitted to us that marvellous science of geometry which
enabled Newton              to unravel the system of the universe,-—with                        this
exception,         there   is   nothing    in the history of what belongs to the
advancement of knowledge so remarkable as the progress which the
European           nations have made in the cultivation                        of the physical
sciences during            the last two hundred years.                   It   is   not only those
who are engaged,            as you are,     in    researches        of this kind, that must
_contemplate         with satisfaction the results of this movement.                            The
moral philosopher,                in the desire of knowledge one of
                                recognizing
 the noblest of our aspirations, will regard the extension of that de
 sire, and the more general diffusion of knowledge, as an important
 means of elevating our species in the scale of intellectual                                beings.
 The unprejudiced theologian will allow that there                            is   no better foun
 dation for the religious             sentiment than the study of natural pheno
 mena, opening as          it   does to our view everywhere examples                      of design,
 and of the adaptation of means to ends, combined with mighty power
 and benevolent intention.                The philosophical             statesman, who, con
 templating the progress of society, endeavours to explain the changes
 which   it   has undergone, and thence to anticipate the future, cannot fail
 to perceive that the cultivation of the physical sciences has been in these
 later times one of the most important                           instruments       of civilization;
 while the mere utilitarian, however little he may                            be capable    of esti

not occupy your time by adducing particular instances of the benefits

of the views of those short-sighted cynics, among whom                                              I am   sorry

     Science has already arrived at great results, far beyond what could
have been reasonably anticipated.                              But the inquisitive mind, looking
into the future, will find reason to believe that                               if we could lift        up the
veil by which it is concealed, we should find that there are other and

space,        have enabled him                 to    determine the nature                  of    the so-called
nebulous matter, and                 to      enter    on   a    new order           of   inquiries    respect

vibrate       in    the magnetic observatories which have been established                                      in
different regions              of   the earth, under the direction                        of     the Treasurer
of   our Society, have already not only made                               us   acquainted with many
important facts connected with terrestrial magnetism, but have dis
closed        to
          us some remarkable relations between the earth and the

observations are still                       progress, and        if   not prematurely brought
to      conclusion,                           be                               doubt that they must

force, which, probably like that                      of   gravity, pervades the universe, and
places even the most distant parts                            of      connexion with each other.

        the same      spirit     of   inquiry during the century which                          is   to   come?
        considering such         a   question,       it   must     be   remembered that, whenever
any addition has been made                           to   the general stock           of   knowledge, the
practical application                 of   it   to     life, for the
                                                     the ordinary purposes                 of
most part,   made not immediately, nor until
                     is                      along time afterwards.
Inthe year 1739, the Rev. Dr. Clayton,  that time Dean      Kildare,at                            of
communicated               to   the Royal Society his experiments                           on   the   distilla
tion      of   coal, and his discovery               of   what     he   called “the spirit           of    coal.”
This spirit           he   confined        in    bladders, and occasionally                     diverted his
friends         by
           puncturing one     them near   candle, thus exhibiting
                                                of                     a                                          a
bright flame which issued from the puncture, until the whole    the
                                                                                                          of of
spirit     in   the bladder was exhausted.                         Now the application                        this
discovery seems,                as   we   see   it   now,    to   have been sufficiently obvious,
yet nearly sixty years elapsed before Mr. Murdoch was led   avail                                       to

In      the     year 1800, Volta, following                       up    the researches           of    Galvani,
discovered the effect which                      the multiplication            of   metallic plates has
of      increasing the electric force.                      About five years afterwards Davy
began that grand series                     of   experiments,            in   which    he       succeeded         in

                                      572
decomposing the alkalies and earths by means of an apparatus similar
to that invented by Volta, but        of larger extent and greater power.
But very many years yet elapsed, and many improvements and modi
<U+FB01>cations of the battery had been effected, before the same method
was made     use   of for the purpose of electro-plating.          Early in the
present century, Davy published an account of the e<U+FB02>'ects produced
on the nervous system by the respiration of the nitrous oxide.                  It
was afterwards      ascertained by physiologists     that the respiration       of
the vapour of ether operates        in a similar manner, symptoms, like
those of intoxication, being followed by a temporary loss of sensi
bility. But it was still many years afterwards that it <U+FB01>rst occurred
 to a dentist in America that the respiration of ether might be employed
for the purpose of producing insensibility to pain during surgical
 operations.    The time may often be long deferred, but our expe
rience warrants the assertion, that there are very few of the discoveries
which have been made in the physical sciences which have not, sooner
 or later, directly or indirectly, had the effect of promoting          the well
being, the convenience, and comforts of mankind.                As it has    been
hitherto,   so we may expect      it to be hereafter.       In the meanwhile,
the Royal Society, gathering to itself those who are most eminent
as cultivators    of any branch of natural philosophy,            has no small
share of responsibility,     and has important       duties to perform.         It
may encourage the deserving;         it may lend    a helping hand to those
who want     it; it   may, as  it always has     done,    render assistance    to
the Government where such assistance          is required.      Nor   am  I arro
gating too much for the Royal Society when             I   say that  it has still
another function, which it even now exercises,           not less substantially
and really because the Fellows of the Society are themselves uncon~
scious of it.     Of the value of knowledge        I  apprehend that few at
the present day will venture to express a doubt.          But in all  ages much
of that which has     been given to the   world   as knowledge has been no
knowledge at all; and from this evil         even the present age,       in spite
of the efforts made for the improvement of education, is not exempt.
An institution such as ours is in this respect a great safeguard to
the public.      Here individuals     engaged in pursuits        which    require
accurate observation and cautious induction,            are   brought    more or
less  into communication with       each other.      Mistakes     as to matters
 of fact, and  too hasty conclusions, are alike corrected.          Though not

                                                     573
in any regular and formal manner, whatever is put forth under the
pretence of it being knowledge, is submitted to a competent tribunal,
whose decisions silently and imperceptibly                             pervade general society,
and go far towards exposing the shams and impostures of the day.
  But I feel that I am occupying too large a portion of the time
which belongs to this evening's meeting, and that                                    I    owe you my
apologies for doing so.                  Allow       me, however, to make one more                         ob
servation, which will,              I                       of every
                                         feel sure, have the cordial assent
one who hears me; namely, that it is desirable that the Royal Society
should persevere in the independent course which it has hitherto
pursued, relying on                its
                        own character and          the exertions        on                               of   its
Fellows, seeking            no
                    adventitious aid, and satisfied with the conviction
that      no   one can labour               in   the acquirement         of   knowledge without,
sooner     or   later, rendering service               to   mankind.
     On the motion           of    Dr. Charles Holland, the thanks                       of   the Society
were voted           to   the President       for his Address, and                 he    was requested

     In   the present communication                        the author     endeavours            to      show,
that the involuntary muscular tissue                        of   the bladder and the voluntary
muscle         in   other parts      of     the human body have               a    like composition,
and that Prof. Kölliker's view, that involuntary                               or    smooth muscle
is   made       up    of    fusiform        cells,   is   incorrect.     On the contrary,                  the
muscular substance    the bladderof composed               is                 of   lengthened fibres

muscular        fibres      in   the bladder are interwoven into                    a    network, and

  II.    “On the Ova       and Pseudova          of Insects.”         By JOHN LUB
          BOCK, Esq.,      F.R.S., F.L.S., F.G.S.                Received      Nov. 10,
          1858.
                                      (Abstract.)
      In the ‘Philosophical Transactions’ for 1857,                 I   endeavoured to
  show that the agamic eggs of Daphnia are formed upon the same
 type, and consist of the same parts, as any other egg.                       My object
  in undertaking the investigation of which the present paper is the
  result, was to determine whether the same held good of the agamic
  eggs or pseudova      of Coccus,   C_1/nips,    and other insects.       This inquiry
 was more interesting, because Prof. Huxley had found several dif
 ferences between the ovarian products of the oviparous and vivipa
 rous Aphides; and because, according to Prof. Leydig, the develop
 ment of the pseudova in Coecus was extremely peculiar.
     My examination of        Coccus   was     concluded, and the results com
 mitted to paper, in the early part of June last, but               I  then found that
 so  little  was known,     especially in this country,          about the develop
 ment of insect-eggs generally, that            I  withheld my notes from publi
 cation, in order to add to them some account of the process of true
 egg-formation      in the Insecta, which would enable                me to   point out
more satisfactorily the di<U+FB01>"erences between,               or the identity of, these
two processes.
    In all female insects there        are two ovaries, each consisting            of at
least    two egg-tubes opening into a common chamber, the uterus.
The     egg originates and attains to nearly its          full size   in the egg-tube,
and it is therefore with this portion of the generative organs that
 we are now mainly concerned.

                                                               575
        The egg-tubes differ very much in number and length.                                                    In    all   the
 larger orders, except perhaps the Lepidoptera and Heteroptera, some
 species have very few, while others possess                                        a    great many.             Thus        in
 Coleoptera,     Lytta vesicatoria has great many, Lixus has    a                                              only two;
 in     Orthoptera, Acheta domestica has great many, while            a                                        ina    small
 Locusta        I     only found         six;     in   Neuroptera,             Libellula has          a   great many,
Psocus only five;                           the Diptera, the majority

phagus only two;                             Homoptera,              Coccus has            a    great many, while
 Aphis padi has only three;                        in     Hymenoptera, Apis mellifica has about

 Dermaptera,               Labidura gigantea has, according                                to   Léon Dufour, only
five, while Forficula auricularia has                                a     great number.
        The number            of   egg-germs           in   each egg-tube differs also very much.
The Lepidoptera,                   in   which        the number                of    egg-tubes        is   very small,

each tube.              On the other hand,                      in   Heteroptera,               the number varies
very little; while  Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and Diptera,
                                   in                      differs                                             it

                                                               means                easy      to   determine         as   that
        the egg-tubes.              It      is   probable that                      each species the number
        definite, except perhaps where                                very numerous, as, for instance,
in is

                                                            is
        certain Lepidoptera                  which have more than                         a   hundred.          In    most
egg-tubes, however, the egg-germs become                                             so    “small         by   degrees,”
that      it    is   almost impossible             to     say exactly how many there are.
        Each egg-tube consists generally,                           if    not always,          of   two membranes.
The outer             or   muscular one                   very evident              in    Hymenoptera,              Geode
phaga, Diptera, and indeed                        in is   most insects, but                in   some cases     I     could
not distinguish              it.     The inner membrane                     is      delicate and structureless.
          its                                layer             epithelial cells, which                     most parts
                                                       in of
On              inner side lies         a                                                             in
form      a     continuous layer; but                          those insects which have                    a   group        of
vitelligenous           cells between each                     of   the egg-germs, they are                     at    these
parts more sparingly distributed.
        These epithelial cells probably take                              an   active part          in   the secretion
of      the yolk       in   all   insects, and are the principal,                        if   not the only organs,
which form the yolk                     in   Orthoptera,             Puler, and the Libellulina.
        Between each              of   the egg-germs                 in   Lepidoptera,              Diptera,        Hyme
moptera,          Geodephaga,                Hydradephaga,                 and Neuroptera                 (except the

                                              576
Libellulina), is situated a group of large cells. These were <U+FB01>rst
noticed by Heroldt, who described them as rings; Stein, however,
is no doubt correct in asserting that they are the secretors                          of the
yolk, and      I therefore     agree   with Prof. Huxley in calling them vitelli
genous cells.         Hermann Meyer, who was followed in this respect by
Dr. Allen Thomson,              considered them as aborted eggs,             an opinion,
however, which          is quite untenable.            A    cursory   examination of an
egg-tube of any Lepidopterous                 or Hymenopterous             insect, will show
that although the vitelligenous               cells increase individually in size, as
does the   yolk      mass, yet that the latter constantly grows at the expense
of the former *, which          become gradually fewer in number, and                 <U+FB01>nally
disappear altogether.
    Stein has observed, that in Acilius aulcatus, in which the yolk is
brightly coloured, the vitelligenous cells are of the same hue. Prof.
Huxley has observed in Aphis, and I havefound in certain Hemi
ptera, as in Nepa for instance, a canal leading down from the terminal
chamber into the egg-tube, and which can be for no other purpose
than to convey the yolk matter to the growing eggs.
    Finally,   if,   as Stein also remarks, we press the vitelligenous cells
or nuclei out of one of the egg-chambers, we shall generally <U+FB01>nd
some    of them in which the cell-wall               is    almost entirely absorbed, so
that on the application of slight pressure, the contents spread in all
directions.
    In its earliest     stage, however, the egg-cell cannot be distinguished
from the vitelligenous cells, and at the upper part of the egg-tube of
any Heteropterous or Dipterous insect, will be found cells, which are
neither vitelligenous          cells nor egg-cells, but which               are apparently
capable, under certain circumstances, of becoming either the one or
the other.
    Dr. Carpenter has          suggested      to me that these vitelligenous           cells
are perhaps analogous to the            “yolk-segments” of Purpura, and this
idea throws,   I      think,   some    light on the very remarkable phenomena
presented by that genus.
     The separation of the egg-germs from the vitelligenous organs,                         is
a   condition found in many worms, in some crustacea, as for instance
in Cyclops, and probably in the Cirrhipedes.
    Our knowledge of the              modes    of egg-formation           in the Insecta,   is

perhaps hardly sufficient to enable us to generalize upon                                              it as yet
with much confidence.                      As far, however,               as we at present are aware,
alternate groups of large vitelligenous                              cells are found in                   all   Lepi
doptera,           Diptera,         Hymenoptera,              Neuroptera             (except Libellulina),
Geodephaga, and Hydradephaga.                                 The large vitelligenous cells are
contained          ina    terminal chamber               in   other Coleoptera, Homoptera, and
Heteroptera; whilst apparently                                they       are    absent      in    Orthoptera,
Libellulina, and Puler.
     This curious subdivision                   of      the Insecta        is   not exactly that which
would    givenbe               by
                 any other characters.      however, remarkable,         It    is,
that the mode of formation of the thorax would divide the Insecta
into two groups very nearly equivalent                                     to   those just mentioned,
except        as   far    as   regards the Geodephaga and Hydradephaga.
     In   fact, the Coleoptera, Orthoptera,                          Dermaptera, and Hemiptera
have      a   very large prothorax, while this segment                               is   small   in   the      Lepi
doptera,           Diptera,         Hymenoptera,              and    most        Neuroptera.               In    the
Libellulina, however,                it  is   distinct        from the rest            of   the thorax and
considerably developed.
     In   the Orthoptera,               Libellulina, and the genus Pulex, we find the
simplest type             of   egg-formation which occurs among the Insecta, the
large vitelligenous cells being entirely absent, and their functions
probably monopolized, instead     being only shared, of the layer                           by                    of
epithelial cells.
  The macula germinativa, which                                                                                 ger

                                                                     fact the nucleus                   the
                                                             is
                                                             in
minal vesicle, has              in   the Orthoptera,                as   usual, the form                  a   small
round vesicle.
   In     OEstrus the germinal vesicle contains several small vesicles, one
of   which grows much larger than the remainder, and becomes the
macula germinativa.
  In      Pulex the germinal vesicle                    is   dark, and the macula germinativa,
which     is   very distinct          in   the young egg-germs, soon disappears.
  In      the Coleoptera (except the Geodephaga and Hydradephaga),
the Homoptera, and the Hemiptera,                                 each egg-tube ends               in     a   large
terminal chamber, full                  of   round cells, each             of   which can apparently
become either             an   egg-cell       or
                                               a    vitelligenous cell.
  In      Nepa and some other forms,                         I      found,       as   Prof. Huxley first
discovered         in    Aphis,     a   duct       or   passage leading              down from the              ter
minal chamber             to    the egg-germs.               In   one specimen there were                       four

                                         578
distinct ducts, so that probably each egg-germ              has a separate    yolk
duct.
   In Nepa there       is a large lateral projection at the anterior end         of
each egg, and     it is always on the same side as the germinal vesicle;
but    this latter    varies    from   side  to   side  without    any apparent
regularity.
    In the common         earwig,  the egg-tubes     are short and numerous;
each consists    of   a  large, lower chamber, which is more or less pear
shaped,     and two or three other chambers, but slightly separated from
one another, bent down on the lower chamber,                   and so short and
small    as to resemble     very closely the stalk to the pear.
    Each egg-germ         in this insect   consists  of two parts;     an egg-cell
containing the germinal vesicle            and the yolk,     and a vitelligenous
cell.     The vitelligenous cell has no distinct nucleus, and in the
small stalk-like part of the egg-tube is double the size of the egg-cell,
which at this period contains the germinal vesicle,               but not as yet
any yolk matter.         In this part of the   egg-tube it sometimes     appeared
as   if there  were two vitelligenous cells to one egg-cell.         In  the large
lower egg-germ this is never the case.              In this part of the   egg-tube
 the vitelligenous cell is still larger than the egg-cell, which however
 grows larger, both absolutely and relatively, until it almost <U+FB01>lls the
 egg-chamber.
     The yolk mass in the lower egg-germ consists of dark granules
 and oil globules surrounding the germinal vesicle, which generally
 contains two      or three minute cell-like vesicles.           The contents    of
the vitelligenous cell are light brown, granular, and in part arranged
in somewhat cylindrical masses, which lie generally rather trans
vensely     to the egg-tube,        and do    not appear      to  have   any   <U+FB01>rm
 boundaries.      At   least,  I  was never able to isolate them, except after
 applying reagents, as, for instance, acetic acid, and then only some
 times, and with di<U+FB02>iculty.           They then appeared to be somewhat
 elliptic in shape.
     From M. Léon Dufour’s            description, the ovary in Labidura gi
gantea is entirely unlike that of Fo1y‘icula.
    The egg-formation in For<U+FB01>cula is not                  the least    remarkable
peculiarity of this extraordinary genus, and does not at all resemble
that of either the Coleoptera or the Orthoptera.
     The Neuroptera (except the
                                          Libellulina) offer the next step to

                                                           579
 wards the type which prevails in the Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera,                                                   and
 Diptera.
    In these four orders, and in the Geodephaga and Hydradephaga,
 each egg-chamber contains, at     upper end, group     its
                                                      large vitelli              a             of
 genous cells,            which are generally few                     in   number       in   the Neuroptera,
 rather more numerous                   in   the Diptera, and still more                      so   in   the Geode
 phaga, Hydradephaga,                    and Hymenoptera.
     In    all   these         six groups, except the Diptera, each egg-chamber                                    is
 divided into two parts                  by  a    transverse constriction,                   which       separates
 the vitelligenous              cells from the germinal vesicle and the yolk                                     sur

 small, but               grows gradually              larger         at      the expense          of   the upper
 part.

vitelligenous             cells, the lowest             of    which           becomes darker             from     the
formation         of   granular yolk-matter,                  and thus forms the egg-cell.                        Its
nucleus      becomes             the germinal              vesicle.           The wall        of    the egg-cell
gradually disappears, and the yolk-mass being enlarged                                               by   the yolk
secreted         by       the vitelligenous             cells, continues                to   increase until        it
occupies the whole egg-chamber.
     Between each egg-germ,                       in    the Diptera,              the egg-tube becomes
extremely narrow, which                      is   not       so   much the case               in   other Insecta.

formation.
     The germinal vesicle                   in   the Carabidae generally contains, besides
the macula germinativa,                       several small vesicles, which                         indeed        are
sometimes very numerous.                          In    Carabus violaceus, the macula itself
appeared         to   consist     of    many small oval masses, and                          in    one specimen
the macula appeared                    to    have broken up, and the constituent bodies
were      floating         about       loose      in   the germinal               vesicle.          From        these
observations,             and from          what has been                     mentioned       as   occurring       in
Pulex,    I   am disposed              to   think that the first embryonic cells,                          at   least
in   Insecta, appear             inthis manner.
     According            to   M. Léon Dufour, Chelonus oculator,                            one    of   the small
Ichneumonidae,                 possesses         no   ovary nor eggs,              but merely four long
tubes leading into                as   many matrices, containing                        a    great number          of

     living embryos, or perhaps nymphs.                   I   examined several specimens,
     and found the female generative organs quite in accordance with his
     descriptions               They are, however, undoubtedly true
                        and <U+FB01>gure.
     ovaries, though the thickness of the outer membrane gives them a
     deceptive appearance.             If the   egg-tubes are torn asunder, egg-germs
     will    he found    in them,      as   in the corresponding organs of any other
     Hymenopterous           insect, and presenting as usual a transverse constric
     tion with the vitelligenous cells in the upper division.
          In the four matrices the          eggs are cylindrical     and somewhat curved,
     and under the action of water, one end of each swells up considerably.
     In this they present              an approach       to that form which         attains its
     greatest development in Cynips.
          The ovaries of Coccus hesperidum               have been        rightly described by
     Prof. Leydig,       as consisting       of    a long tube on each side opening by
     a very short oviduct         into the egg-canal.            The whole      surface   of the
     tube is covered with egg-germs in all stages of development.                           The
     collateral glands are very small in C. heaperidum, but are well de
     veloped in C. persicce.
          In its earliest     stage     the egg-follicle is a simple projection of the
     ovarian wall, which becomes                  gradually     pear-haped, and may then
     be     seen   to consist of a structureless outer membrane, a layer                      of
     epithelial     cells,    and three         vitelligenous    cells,    with very delicate
     walls.
          The walls of       these cells soon disappear, and even the nuclei are
     often scarcely distinguishable,               but acetic acid will generally make
     them more visible.   Leuckart has given a correct account of these
     bodies, and indeed of the whole process ; but Leydig apparently mis
     took them for germinal vesicles.
        The epithelial cells line the membrane constituting the egg-follicle.
      As usual, they are columnar in the lower chamber and <U+FB02>attened and
     scattered in the upper.            They contain      a circular nucleus.       The action
      of water     causes them, and indeed the whole upper chamber, to swell
      considerably. The columnar epithelial cells of the lower chamber
     contain generally small greenish globules, apparently identical with
      the small oil globules which form so large a part of the yolk, which

"1          The germinal     vesicle    makes its appearance after the vitelligenous
      cells, and generally after the egg-follicle has lost its original              pyriform

shape.        It   is about 0008 in diameter.                             The macula germinativa is
single, and somewhat granular in appearance.
  About the          same time as the germinal vesicle, the                                       oil   globules make
their appearance, and soon become the most conspicuous part   the                                                   of
egg. They are       first very small, but
                              at            mature egg the larger         in   a
ones are      as   much         as   0016        in     diameter.          The         oil   globules may often
be    seen    with their sides much flattened                                   by     mutual pressure, and
must therefore possess   somewhat compact pellicle.
                                        a
   Very soon after the appearance     the first   globules, the egg
                                                               of                       oil
follicle loses       its
                pear-shaped form, the basal part swells, and   sepa                                                is
rated from the apical part containing the nuclei                                             of   the vitelligenous
cells,   by   a    constriction.            It    now perfectly resembles the egg-chamber
of   any ordinary insect,                in    consisting           of   an   upper chamber containing
the vitelligenous cells, and                     a     lower chamber devoted                       to    the germinal
vesicle and the yolk.
   According             to   M. Leydig, the constriction                              gradually           disappears,
and the egg finally occupies both chambers; but this                                              is    incorrect, and
M. Leuckart              is   right      in    asserting that the vitelligenous                                cells     dis
appear, and the upper chamber becomes atrophied,                                              so   that the mature
egg lies      in    the lower chamber only.                              This process               is   exactly that
which the analogy                  of   other insects would lead                        us   to   expect.
   The general cavity                   of   the body          of    the female Coccus always                            con

nature.        They are            st',                length,      and vary            in    length, but               on   an
average about             5:...           Coccus persicae                contains       a    number            of   similar
bodies, which however are cylindrical.                                    Almost always immediately
after the disappearance                     of   the vitelligenous cells, two                       or   three masses
of   these cells may               be   found      at    the lower part               of   the upper chamber,
and soon after            in   the egg itself.            It   is   difficult     to    understand why these
cells should appear              period                                               the history         of   the egg

                       definite    at     so               a
formation. Prof. Huxley has pointed out                                               me that       Dr.       W.   Wittich
has already described                   a   Conferva found               in    hen's eggs.               It    does not,
however, seem clear that these eggs would have arrived                                                    at   maturity,
and  I   believe that the parasites                      of   Coccus are the first which have ever
been known           to    exist     in   eggs without impeding their development.
     The mature egg contains numerous vitelline                                          sphaerules           which are
from     #7     signto  diameter, and offer
                                   in                                          every appearance                     of   true
cells, but that they contain    nucleus.           no

                                             582
   The mature        egg is a    light  green,  ovate  mass about E5-3-6    in length
and   f<U+FB02>-3-0
               in breadth, and possesses           apparently    only one envelope.
It  contains a well-formed            embryo before it leaves the ovary, and is
hatched,     I  believe, only a few hours after being laid.            According    to
M. Leydig, the <U+FB01>rst         trace    of the embryo    arises at the free or cephalic
end, but my observations have led me to the opposite conclusion.
    C. pereicze differs from C. hesperidum in being decidedly oviparous               ;
that is to say, the eggs, when deposited, do not contain an embryo,
and remain under the protection                 of the mother     some   time before
being hatched.           This difference probably           makes tehm require       a
stronger      egg-shell,    and accordingly        we   <U+FB01>nd   the collateral   glands
 more    developed.       In most      respects,   however, the egg-development
is very similar in these two species, but the egg-follicles are smaller and
neater in C. persicaz than in the former species, and the vitelligenous
cells are <U+FB01>ve or seven in number instead of three, spherical and very
distinct.
    In Cynips lignicola, the ovary consists of a number of egg-tubes
which fall into a common oviduct, and each of which contains
thirteen eggs.
   This    species has in the last few years become             very common in the
South-west of England, but as yet only females have been discovered.
   It  is fair  to assume, therefore, that the eggs are agamic, or adopting
Prof. Huxley’s        name,      pseudova.      Nevertheless, there is absolutely
nothing,     so far as our knowledge at present extends, to distinguish
the egg-formation from that which occurs in any other Hymenopterous
insect.
   The mature         egg  of    Cg/nips   is indeed  of  a very remarkable shape,
as  it consists of     a long tube with a small swelling at one end, and a
larger one at the other, in which the yolk is situated.
   The larger       end occupies the usual place         of the  egg, but as the tube
elongates,      the smaller end pushes its way up the egg-tube, which
elongates considerably         ;   and, <U+FB01>nally, all the large ends are at the lower
end, and the small ones at the upper end,                   of the egg-tube, which
gives the ovary a curious appearance.                 Even after the egg is fully
formed, a slight pressure will bring the germinal vesicle into view.
   Many of the Lepidoptera have presented us with cases of Parthe
nogenesis, and in these instances there is no reason to suppose that
the formation of the eggs differs from the usual type.                     The same

                                                    083
holds good in Solenobia lichenella, in which agamic                            eggs are the rule,
instead of the exception.
      In    the Hive-bee also, the early development of the ova and of the
pseudova must apparently be identical, since it would appear that in
an impregnated                female, the ovarian          product         has already left     the
ovary before it is decided whether                        it is to become         an ovum or a
pseudovum, and whether                   it is to give birth to        a male or to a female.
      It   is,   therefore, I      think, proved that     we must not look        in the ovarian
egg for differences necessarily depending on sexual in<U+FB02>uence,                                   but
that       we shall <U+FB01>nd them,          if   anywhere, in the subsequent stages of egg
development.
   Prof. Huxley and Leuckart have recently shown, that whereas the
vitelligenous cells are well developed in the oviparous Aphidee, they
are much less apparent in the agamic or viviparous forms; so much
so indeed as to make these naturalists doubt whether they take any
part in the secretion of the yolk.                   While waiting for the publication
of Prof. Huxley’s observations,                I    have paid but little attention to the
Aphidee; but           it     struck   me as    a   curious coincidence, that, in Ooccus
also, while          the vitelligenous         cells are very distinct in the oviparous
C. percicaa,          they are much less apparent in the almost viviparous
C. hesperidum.                It   would     of course
                                          highly unphilosophical to
                                                           be
draw any conclusion from four instances, but    will be curious  the  it                  if
same        connection        between       oviparity,    and the presence          of well-de
veloped vitelligenous               cells on the one hand, and viviparity, with less
developed vitelligenous cells on the other,                     is   found to prevail in other
species.
  It       has been generally stated that all species                       of Aphides   are,   in
spring and summer, self-fertile and viviparous, and become in autumn
oviparous, while the eggs require impregnation.                            I   cannot, however,
help thinking          it   probable, that in cold and in mountainous regions,
where at any period of the year frosts may occur, we shall <U+FB01>nd species
which are always oviparous                    (as indeed
                                                            is   said to be the case with
Aplzis abietis)        ;    while in tropical regions, where frosts are unknown
and leaves are less often deciduous, other species                            may occur which

      In this     paper the author gives a description of a fossil skull and
certain of the teeth of a quadrnped of the size of a lion, in which he
points     out the characters indicative of its carnivorous habits and of
its a<U+FB02>inities to the marsupial order.

evince the carnivorous habits of the extinct species.                          Its marsupial
nature      is,   in the author’s         opinion,    demonstrated        by   the following
cranial structures             :—A large vacuity in the bony palate;              a   propor

the entocarotid canal; the great interval between the foramen ovale

some      of   the principal errors upon which this theory                                        is   based.       For
this purpose, the results                        various experiments made                          by   the author,
and which were repeated                       in of   the presence              ofa      Select Committee             at
Woolwich,           are described and explained.
      These experiments are held                        by      the author not only                to   afford    com
plete evidence             of   the unsoundness                      of    the present theory,                  but   as
sufficiently         conclusive          to   serve

actual strength                    metal required for the gun,                           -are      circumstances,
which,        as   the author believes, have not only been misunderstood, but
for which laws have                    been assigned directly opposed                             to   the truth.

    As     an instance            of this, the hitherto received theory supposes
that when            a    shot is fired from a gun, it acquires velocity gradually,              its
from the pressure                    of     the elastic fluid generated                               by   the fired powder
acting upon                    through            certain space.                  It            also supposed that the

initial pressure               of   this elastic fluid           is   the same                  all   cases    (the quantities
of      powder being proportional),                         whether the gun from which the shot                                         is
fired      be   large      or    small;          so   that the larger the calibre                              of   the gun, the
slower the first movement                             of   the shot       is      supposed             to   be.        The result
of      the following experiment                       is   given       to      prove that the first                        of   these
propositions              is   incorrect.             The author placed                     a   cast-iron shot             3    inches
                                             14                  weight upon                     chamber half                   an   inch

        diameter and half                   an   inch      deep.        This chamber was formed                                      in   a
        gun-metal, and contained, when filled,
            of                                                                                                              powder.
                                                                                                                       of of
block                                                                                             one dram
Upon lighting the powder, the ball was driven                                                   to    a   height            5    feet     6
inches; when the ball was placed                                   at   #      of      an   inch over the chamber,
the charge failed                   to   move        it.
        From this         it   is   inferred that the first force                       of      the powder            is   an   impul
sive force, that               is   to   say,    it   imparts      to   the shot            at   once       a    finite velocity.
 In      order   to       place the matter beyond                             a   doubt, and                to      ascertain the
relative force             of       different quantities                of     powder, the author caused                                  a
chamber          to      be made similar                   in   form to, but            of   twice the linear dimen
sions of, the former;                            he   then placed               a      cast-iron ball                 of   6    inches
in      diameter upon the orifice                          of    this chamber, which was filled with
powder; upon firing the latter, the ball was driven                                                         up

the metal     which the chamber was formed also showed the increase
                     in
 in     the initial force             of    the powder: this                     is    considered              to     be   sufficient
 proof that the last two                          of    the above-mentioned propositions                                         are      as

  Thus it appears that the powder which in<U+FB02>ames more rapidly has
amuch greater initial force, being more concentrated in its action; a
quick burning powder therefore is better for ordnance of small length,
such as mortars and iron howitzers.               The different results produced by
powder of different quality have, according                     to the author, been en
tirely overlooked in the hitherto received theory.                        This theory, which
considers the secondary force, namely, the elasticity of the <U+FB02>uid only,
and takes no account whatever of the enormous impulsive, or initial
force, produced by the sudden conversion of the powder into an elastic
<U+FB02>uid, is that which regulates the system upon which ordnance are at
present constructed;              hence   the reason why large guns are so liable
to burst, so much so, that             it has   been said that no gun larger than a
32-pounder is safe to <U+FB01>re.    From the variety of experiments made
by the author, he arrives at the conclusion, that when powder is of the
same quality, and con<U+FB01>ned in chambers of similar form, but of differ
ent sizes, the initial force varies, within certain limits, in the ratio of
W
    17’
          where w       is   the weight of the powder and w’ of the ball.
   Thus were this new theory recognized, the question of the in
crease of strength with increased thickness of metal, would wear an
entirely new aspect. So far from the metal in large guns diminishing
in strength in the proportion              assumed,   it   will      be   a   matter for inquiry
how               resists the great strain to which             is   subjected, rather than
          it it
                                                           it
why                   <U+FB01>nd from the experiments described above,
                  yields; for   we
that   68-pounder gun, which has
          a                       calibre of twice the diameter of
                                                 a
a  9-pounder gun, must, when <U+FB01>red with the same proportionate
charge of powder as the latter, continually be subject to as great                            a
strain as the latter would suffer            if   always <U+FB01>red with the proof charge,
which         is    three times the quantity of the ordinary service charge.

      I  propose in the present      memoir    to  consider   the geometrical
  theory:    I  have alluded to this part of the subject in the articles
  Nos. 3 and 4 of the introductory          memoir.    The present memoir
  relates to the geometry of one dimension and the geometry             of two
  dimensions corresponding       respectively to the analytical theories of

                                                 590
binary and ternary quantics. But the theory of binary quantics is
considered for its own sake; the geometry of one dimension is so
immediate an interpretation           of the theory of binary quantics, that
for its own sake         there is no necessity to consider it at all; it is con
sidered with a view to the geometry of two dimensions.                                     A chief
object of the present memoir                     is the establishment               upon    purely
descriptive principles of the notion of distance.

   This integral, though not found by the direct integration of the
differential      equation,       and though         evidently        not the general sym
bolical integral of         it,   is   proved to be the general integral for wave
motion, from its affording the means of satisfying all the necessary
equations of initial disturbance and wave-motion.
  The author <U+FB01>rst            discusses      wave-motion when temperature                   is   sup
posed to be unaffected by the passage of                     a   wave; and then when the

 change of temperature          is allowed      for.    The most important result
in the former      case is the       relation     between     pressure and velocity,
 which is shown to      be that which is expressed by the equation

    With respect to the velocity of sound, which has hitherto                    been
found experimentally to          exceed the velocity obtained by theory,          it is
shown    that the value obtained             by approximative         methods is the
minimum limit of sound-velocity,                so that     the actual velocity    will
always    be   greater;    the excess       depending       upon the intensity    and
genesis of the sound.          It  is shown that all the parts          of  a wave do
not travel   at the same rate,-—a circumstance which                leads to the for
mation of a bore in the front of the wave.                 Several previously unex
plained   phenomena, which have been recorded by different experi
mentalists,    such   as   double     reports      of <U+FB01>re-arms heard at       a great
distance,    the  outrunning of          one    sound     by another    observed by
Capt. Parry, the comparative powers of different gases of trans
mitting sounds, and the laws of transmission of sound from one
medium      to another,     are accounted         for in this paper, and directly
deduced from the integral of the equation of wave-motion.

    In a note on the alleged transformation               of thialdine into leucine,

    A  superficial comparison of the properties of thialdine with those
 of the substance produced by the action of bisulphide of carbon upon
 amylamine, enabled me at once to recognize the difference of the two
 bodies; and satisfied with the result,      I did not at the time examine
 more minutely into the nature of the latter substance.
    The new interest conferred upon leucine by recent researches
 which characterize this substance       as capronamic acid, has called my
 attention back to the sulphuretted derivative of amylamine.
    This body may be readily procured by mixing anhydrous amyl
 amine with a solution of dry bisulphide of carbon in anhydrous
 ether.     The mixture becomes hot, and deposits, on cooling, white
 shiny scales which are scarcely soluble in ether, and may therefore
 be purified by washing      with this liquid.
    The new body is likewise insoluble in water, but readily dissolves
 in alcohol; when dry, it may be exposed for a time to a temperature
 of 100°C. without undergoing fusion; after some time, however, the
 substance begins to be liquefied        and to undergo complete decom
 position.     The   same   change occurs, although    more slowly,   at the
 common temperature, when sulphuretted             hydrogen   is evolved; a
 mixture of free sulphur with a new crystalline substance, extremely
 fusible, insoluble in water, but soluble both in alcohol and ether,
 remaining behind.
    Analysis has proved that the compound produced by the action
 of bisulphide of carbon upon amylamine contains
                     C, H, NS,               C, H, N, S.;

                                  or rather
 and that     it is formed by the union of 2 equivalents of amylamine
 with bisulphide of carbon.

                       Amylamine.            New compound.
    A glance     at this formula suffices to characterize this compound as
 amylsulphocarbamate        of amylamine.

    This   view is easily confirmed by experiment.       Addition of hydro
 chloric acid to the crystalline compound immediately separates an
 oily liquid, which gradually solidifies, and the acid solution now con

                                        593
tains amylamine which may be liberated by potassa.                 The oily sub
stance is obviously amylsulphocarbamic          acid: it dissolves in ammonia
and in potassa; mixed with amylamine, it reproduces the original
crystalline compound.
    Experiments     with ethylamine have furnished perfectly analogous
results.    I have been satisfied to establish qualitatively          the analogy
of the   reactions.
    It is of some interest to compare the deportment of amylamine
under the influence of bisulphide of carbon with that of phenylamine
in the   same conditions.       If both  bodies gave rise to similar changes,
we should expect in the case of phenylamine the formation               of phenyl
sulphocarbamate         of phenylamine.         But experiment        has proved
that phenylamine         immediately    produces diphenyl-sulphocarbamide
                   -Y
 (sulphocarbanilide),     sulphuretted hydrogen being evolved—

     Nevertheless    it is extremely probable that further experiments
 will establish a perfect analogy in the deportment of bisulphide of
 carbon with amylamine          and phenylamine.         Diphenyl-sulphocarba
 mide is probably the product          of decomposition of       a very unstable
 phenylsulphocarbamate         of phenylamine—

W.   “On New Nitrogenous Derivatives of the Phenyl- and Ben
      zoyl-Series.”      By P. GRIEss, Esq.           Communicated by Dr.
       HoFMANN.        Received     December 9, 1858.
   Piria's important discovery that the action of nitrous acid upon
asparagin gives rise to the formation of malic acid, has led to a very
general application     of this agent in the study of nitrogenous sub
stances.    The results obtained have been almost always analogous
to those produced by Piria; the reaction may be illustrated by the
following examples:—

   The plan hitherto      adopted consisted in submitting            the aqueous
solution, of the nitrogenous body directly           to the action of nitrous
acid, or in dissolving the body in nitric acid, and passing into the
solution a current of binoxide       of nitrogen.      By employing alcoholic
and ethereal solutions,    I have arrived    at different results, establishing
a new mode     of reaction; of the facts which        I have observed the       fol

     The new body, for which           I propose the provisional name diazodi
 nitrophenol,    is soluble in alcohol and ether, and crystallizes from the
 former solvent in magni<U+FB01>cent golden-yellow plates, which detonate
 on heating.       Acids have no action upon this substance; on ebulli
tion with water it appears to undergo decomposition; alkalies induce
at once a copious evolution of gas, and give rise to the formation of
dinitrophenol.        This metamorphosis             appears to indicate    that  the
new body still belongs directly to the phenol-group ; the constitu

presenting it by the formula

    This paper is    a sequel to two        former    communications   made to
the Royal Society by the author.              In the first of these (communi
cated in 1855), the deflection of the plumb-line caused by the mountain
mass north of Hindostan is calculated;            and in the second (communi

vailing through extensive parts of the earth's mass, is found, with a
view to determine whether any compensating cause can possibly exist
below to counteract the large amount    of deflection caused by the
superficial mass lying above the sea-level. A survey of the causes
of disturbance of the plumb-line cannot be complete without taking
into consideration the influence of the ocean. To approximate to
this is the object of the present paper.
   The author first adverts to the peculiar geographical position of
Hindostan.              The highest mountain-ground                        in the world lies to the
north of        it;      and an unbroken               expanse        of   ocean        extends from              its
shores down             to   the neighbourhood               of   the South Pole.                  The excess
of    matter presented               by   the first causes            a   deflection          of   the plumb
line towards the north, decreasing                       in   amount        as   we travel southwards.
The deficiency               of   matter arising from the second causes                            a    deflection
of    the plumb-line              also towards the           north, but decreasing                  in    amount
 as   we travel northwards.                    The consequence              is,   that while these two
causes conspire              to
                           increase the deflection    the different stations, the
                                                                      at
action     of      the second tends to reduce      amount the errors which the
                                                              in
mountain-attraction                 causes     in   the amplitudes.
      But the attraction             of   the mountains northwards, and the deficiency
 of   attraction         of  the ocean southwards—which                        last     is,   in   fact, equiva
lent      to   a   repulsive force northwards—combine                               to   produce another
effect upon the measures                    of    the survey besides the deflection                          of   the
plumb-line.              They have          a     sensible influence              in    changing the          sea
level,     so      as   to   make the level            at    Karachi, near the mouth                         of   the
 Indus—to which    great longitudinal chain

                                       in                     of

 the great arc.               In  other words, the level    Karachi    many feet
                                                                            at                     is
 higher than            it   would     bethat place,
                                            at                     if,

 remained unchanged, the disturbing attractions were removed.
      The author then proceeds with the details                             of    the calculation, which
      conducted          by   the method          of   his former papers.                   In   our ignorance

 the form          of   its bed.       The author assumes                  a   law      as    tothe variation

without too much labour.       The expression of this law involves three
arbitrary constants, representing depths at particular places, of which
the various deflections are linear functions. He next calculates nume
rically the coefficients of the arbitrary constants in the expressions

babilities           of the     case, to make             further assumptions as to the ratios
of two of these                constants to the            third; and lastly,                as to the numerical
value of the remaining constant.                   The general character of the assump

SIR BENJAMIN                       C.   BRODIE, Bart., President, in the Chair.
I. “On     the Embryogeny of Comatula Rosacea (Linck).”     By
         WYvILLE THoMsoN, Esq., Professor of Geology in Queen’s
         College,          Belfast.          Communicated                 by     Dr. CARPENTER.
         Received December 7, 1858.
                                                 (Abstract.)
   The author briefly described the male and female reproductive
organs of Comatula.   When the ova are mature, and before impreg
nation,       they are protruded                   and remain hanging from the ovarian
orifice, entangled in the areolar tissue of the everted ovary.                                            In
this position impregnation                   appears usually to take place.
     After segmentation of the yelk, a solid nucleus is formed in the
centre     of the mulberry yelk-mass.                           This nucleus becomes invested
in a special membrane, and into this embryonic mass the remainder
of the yelk is gradually absorbed. Ciliary motion is observed at
various points on the surface of the inclosed embryo, which finally
assumes        its   characteristic form.                 The young larva,          on   escaping from
the egg, consists             of   a    homogeneous mass                  of   pale-yellow      granular
matter, with scattered nuclei, cells, and oil-globules.                                   It    is   barrel
shaped, and girded             at   intervals with about five broad ciliated bands.
    As   development proceeds, one                        of   these belts becomes depressed              at
a   certain    point; and within the loop thus formed,                            an   inversion     of the
integument indicates the position                          of   the rudimentary mouth.
    A    distinct oesophagus            and stomach are rapidly differentiated,                         and
a   short intestine, ending                 in   a      large anal orifice, near the posterior
extremity        of    the animal.                The larva         at   the same        time    becomes
lengthened and vermiform; the girding ciliated bands resolve                                         them
selves    into   a     single transverse band, encircling                       the body near the
anterior extremity, and                 a   band passing below the mouth and                         longi
tudinally down either side                         the tail.
                                            of of to
  Large lobulated masses                               fine granular tissue occupy the cavity
of   the body         on   either side                 the alimentary canal.
  The echinoderm-zooid originates, apparently, beneath the integu
ment   the larva, but perhaps
          of                         inversion                 an
                                                 that integument,
                                                         in                    of

in the form of a rosette of cells encysted near the upper extremity
of the intestine. The rosette is at first single, but shortly takes the
appearance of a double ring, the rings being united by a curved tube.
These rings seem to represent the rudiments of the ambulacral
vascular system of the echinoderm, and the curved tube the origin of
the alimentary canal.                A   dense coating           of granular areolar tissue is
formed round the young crinoid, obscuring the further development
of   the internal        organs.         The mode of              its   disengagement from the
larva was not observed.
                                                                                   in
     Free from the locomotive larva, the echinoderm                                its    earliest stage
isa    motionless, white, egg-like body, covered externally with                                  a    thick
transparent layer, which               is    traversed vertically             by   scattered fusiform
oil-cells.
     Beneath this layer are seen rapidly-forming                         patches        of   the calcified
areolar      tissue      so   characteristic           of   the class.         The body becomes
club-shaped; the narrow end attaches itself                             by   cement-matter        to   some
foreign substance, and             a   head and stem are distinguished.
     Two corresponding rows                  of    five plates each (the basalia, and the
first row     of   the interradialia)               form    a   calcareous chalice round the
base   of   the head.          Rudimentary             arms now first make their appear
ance, and the development                    of   the attached pentacrinal form proceeds
steadily.
     From his observations             of    several broods during the spring                     of   1858,
the author was led              to   believe that, under circumstances favourable
to   the production           of   the pentacrinal             stage, the development              of    the
larva may          be                       any     of   its
                                     of in
                        arrested                               earlier stages, and before the
complete differentiation                     its   internal organs.           It   is   hoped that the
observations        of
                 another season may solve this and other questions
which still remain somewhat obscure.

        By   J.    P.    GAssIoT, Esq., W.P.R.S.
                                              (Abstract.)
     The author         of   this Paper       states that        he   procured several vacuum
tubes from         M. Geissler           of   Bonn,         and alludes        to   the experiments

                                       602
made in similarly        constructed    tubes by     M. Pliicker (Phil. Mag.
August 1858), but <U+FB01>nding it impracticable to ascertain with accu
racy the nature of the residual gas, he reluctantly laid them aside.
All the vacuum-tubes in which his experiments                  were   made,   were
prepared by himself or in his presence; as each was exhausted and
hermetically sealed,      it was marked     with   a consecutive    number; up
wards of 100 were thus prepared;             many were broken        or otherwise
destroyed, but the remainder he retains with the original numbers
for future reference.        The author     uses several    terms, which he ex
plains: air, hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen (mercurial) denote that
the vacuum-tube contains vapour of mercury plus the air or gas
remaining     in the tube with which it was <U+FB01>lled previous to the in
troduction     of the mercury: he applies the terms outer positive or
negative, and inner positive or negative, to denote the character of
the discharge from the terminals;           conductive     and reciprocating de
note the pecnliar conditions        of discharges from an induction         appa
ratus when taken in vacuum-tubes          ;  with   a conductive discharge the
needle  of  a galvanometer       placed in the circuit will be de<U+FB02>ected,         as
are also the strati<U+FB01>cations on the approach         of a magnet——they     having,
as the author has shown        in his former communication,         a tendency to
rotate as a whole round either pole, but in contrary directions;               in a
reciprocating     discharge    the strati<U+FB01>cations      are   confused, they are
divided or separated by the magnet, and the needle of a galvanometer
placed in the circuit is not de<U+FB02>ected.                                            _
    The author explains the condition which the strati<U+FB01>ed discharge
assumes   if   any air or gas remains or is subsequently introduced into
a  Torricellian vacuum, and describes what he denominates                 a white
and a blue tongue discharge, which under certain conditions always
appears at the negative terminal.             In Torricellian    vacua,  if air or
nitrogen is introduced, the strati<U+FB01>cations,          exclusive of their altered
form, exhibit a red colour, while when hydrogen or oxygen is added,
they retain the bluish-grey appearance           :  when the ends of the tubes
were punctured      by means of an electrical spark from a machine, the
air or gas could be admitted so gradually as to occupy two or three
hours in the experiment, and in this manner the preceding results
were obtained.
    In the best Torricellian vacua the author          has been able to obtain,
the strati<U+FB01>cations     always assumed a long cloud-like appearance;              by

                                                        603
using ten cells, heon one occasion observed distinct sets                                                    of stratifi
cations, one from each terminal, in opposite directions.
  From a variety of experiments made in the laboratory of the
Royal Institution in temperatures varying from -102° to upwards of
+600°Fahr., he obtained the following results:—
 When the flame of a spirit-lamp is applied to the discharge in                                                            a
vacuum-tube, the stratifications,                      if they          are narrow, will become clearer
and divided, attaching themselves to the warmer portion of the tube;
if a section of the tube is heated, the stratifications in that section
will be more separated, becoming closer in the cooler portion.
     If heat   is applied to a tube which shows the cloud-like stratifica
tions, they will lose their clear distinctness;                                             the deposit from the
negative wire appears to be more free, and distinct sparks or                                                          dis

indicating     a   heat     of    upwards             of   +600°, the stratifications are also
destroyed; but             in   this case the mercury                            as   it    condenses       carries the
discharge, becoming               a    conductor.
     When the mercury                 is   frozen the stratifications disappear, and the
discharge did not then illuminate                               the entire length                  of    the tube;        on

with the assistance               of       Dr. Frankland, vacua were obtained                                       by   ab
sorbing      rarefied carbonic acid                        by   means             of   caustic potassa.                This
process     is   described, and             a   drawing          of         the apparatus           is   given.

     In   carbonic acid vacua the discharge at first appears in the form
of        line; it is strongly affected on the approach of a magnet
     a wavy
or by the hand, but does not generally present the stratified ap
pearance; if this be present, it is only near the positive terminal:
sometimes in the course of a few minutes, but often not until after
several days, stratifications             are visible, which,             as the carbonic         acid
becomes          absorbed, increase;         they subsequently               assume        a conical
form, and lastly, the clear cloud-like                 character          of the best Torricel

perceived #th            of   an inch     in length, and the peculiar blue phos
phorescent light, that in the ordinary                        state is perceptible            at the
negative, is perceptible at both terminals, and a galvanometer shows
that the discharge is no longer conductive.
     After noticing the difficulty of obtaining in carbonic acid vacuum
tubes precisely the same results, the author describes one experiment
in which moisture was purposely introduced; in this tube the strati
fied discharge was very clear and distinct.   He states (and describes
the illustrative experiment) that under certain conditions the stratifi
cations entirely             disappear,    the vacuum             insulating     the discharge.
Carbonic         acid vacuum-tubes were prepared,                         into which arsenious
acid,       iodine, bromine, pentachloride                 of antimony, bichloride                and
bisulphide         of
              carbon were severally introduced, and the results ob
tained are described.
     In Torricellian          vacua   the author was necessarily limited in the
size   of the glass          vessels employed,     but with carbonic acid this diffi
culty no longer exists; in one                vessel       of 7 inches internal diameter,
the stratified discharge was observed to                           fill   the entire space;         in
another, the discharges were made                                 in                  of
                                                   of to

through        a   small hole    in   the centre       a    glass diaphragm.
  After many trials, the author ascertained that     the negative ter       if
minal    covered with glass tubing (open
            is                                 each end)          at
                                                              about 4th              to

                                                the stratifications are
destroyed.              In
                this state the negative discharge appears       issue                        to
with considerable force  through the  orifice; this discharge can                                   be
deflected          by

phosphorescent spot    perceivable, which spot
                                 is                                         is

sensibly heated.              The author remarks that               in    this experiment there

                                       605
is  the appearance      of  a direction    of a force emanating from the
negative.
    In  some  of the vacuum-tubes beyond the clear cloud-like strati<U+FB01>ca
tions, but nearer the negative terminal, several faint striae can be
obtained: on repeating Mr. Grove’s experiment (Phil. Mag. July
1858), of allowing the discharge to pass between two metallic points
attached to the coil, the author        observed that these faint striae in
variably disappeared.
    Strati<U+FB01>cations   remarkably    sensitive to induction    on the approach
of the hand     were obtained in a glass cylinder    of about   4% inches dia
meter, in which the wires were hermetically        sealed 21 inches apart.
    From the absorption of carbonic acid by caustic potassa, not only
were vacua obtained far more perfect than by the Torricellian method,
but the     process   can   be  made so gradual       as   to occupy     several
weeks, or even months, thus enabling the experimenter to examine
the phenomena        of the strati<U+FB01>ed discharge under a variety of con
ditions, several of which the author describes; in this manner the
non-transferring condition      for   the electrical discharge in a vacuum
has been experimentally         ascertained.    The author considers that
this con<U+FB01>rms the opinion he ventured to offer in his previous
 paper; for if the pulsations or vibrations of an electrical discharge are
greatest in the bright bands and least in the obscure, this system of
interference or of pulsations would also account for the entire absence
 of strati<U+FB01>cations    when the air or gas is not su<U+FB01>iciently        rare<U+FB01>ed, as
well    as when the vacuum      becomes nearly perfect, while the gradual
 change of narrow to cloud-like strati<U+FB01>cations           is thus satisfactorily
 explained.
     In  an additional   note to his    Paper,  the author describes some
 further experiments, particularly one of moving the vacuum-tube to
 and fro in a rapid manner, or rotating it in a plane, while the dis
 charges are made, either singly or continuously       :  in the latter case the
 strati<U+FB01>ed discharges are separated, giving the appearance of an illumi
 nated fan or wheel; in the former, only a single discharge is per
 ceptible,   taking place in whatever direction the tube may at the
 instant be placed.       The author considers this experiment as con
 <U+FB01>rmatory     of his former opinion, that the strati<U+FB01>cations are entirely
 due to a single disruption of the primary circuit.
     The experiments,    as  described in the Paper, were exhibited by the
 author to the Society.

         F.R.S., and P. G. Tan‘, M.A., F.C.P.S.              Communicated
         by Dr. ANDREWS.           Received December 16, 1858.
     Since the publication      of their “ Note on the Density of Ozone”
  (Proceedings of the Royal Society, June 1857), the authors have
 been occupied with an extended investigation into the nature and
 properties of that body.        The inquiry having proved more protracted
 than they anticipated, they have thought it proper to send to the
 Royal Society a brief notice of some of the more important facts
 which     they have already observed, reserving a description          of the
 methods employed, and of the ‘details of the experiments, for a
 future communication.
~
    The commonly         received   statement, that the whole of a given
 volume of dry oxygen gas contained alone in an hermetically sealed
 tube can be converted into ozone by the passage of electrical sparks,
is erroneous.      In repeated trials, with tubes of every form and        size,
 the    authors   found that      not more than   Th   part of the oxygen
could thus be changed into ozone.            A greater effect was,  it is true,
produced by the silent discharge between <U+FB01>ne platina points; but
this   also had its  limit.    In order to carry on the process, it is   neces
sary to introduce        into the apparatus    some  substance, such as a
solution of iodide of potassium, which has the property of taking
up, in the form of oxygen, the ozone as it is produced.          After many
trials, an apparatus was contrived in the form of a        double U, having
a solution    of iodide of potassium in one end,.and a column of frag
ments of fused chloride of calcium interposed between this solution
and the part of the tube where the electrical discharge was passed.
The chloride of calcium allowed the ozone to pass, but arrested the
vapour of water;           that, while the discharge always took place in
                       so
dry oxygen, the ozone was gradually absorbed.            The experiment is
not yet <U+FB01>nished, but already one-fourth of the                         of the
                                                       gas in a tube

                                        607
capacity of 10 cubic centimetres has disappeared.              To produce this
effect, the discharge from a machine in excellent order has been
passed through the tube for twenty-four          hours.
    When oxygen is thus converted into ozone, a diminution of volume
takes place. The greatest contraction occurs with the silent discharge,
and amounts        to about Bl; of the volume      of the  gas.    The   passage
of sparks has less       effect  than the silent discharge, and will even
destroy a part of the contraction obtained by means of the latter.
If  the apparatus be exposed for a short time to the temperature of
250° C., so as to destroy the ozone, it will be found that the gas on
cooling has recovered exactly its original volume.            This observation
proves, unequivocally,      that   if ozone be oxygen in an allotropic con
dition, its density is greater than that of oxygen. Experiments still
in progress indicate that the density of ozone obtained by the elec
trical discharge must, on the above assumption, be represented by
even a  higher number than that deduced by the authors from their
experiments on ozone prepared by electrolysis.
    When mercury is brought into contact with dry oxygen, in which
ozone has been formed by the electrical discharge, it loses to a great
extent its mobility,      and may be made to cover the interior of the
tube with a <U+FB01>ne re<U+FB02>ecting surface resembling that of an ordinary
mirror.      It is remarkable that this great change        in the  state of the
mercury    is not   accompanied    by  any further   diminution of the volume
of the gas. The apparatus employed by the authors would have
enabled them to estimate with certainty a change of volume amount
ing to   W-5-01;    part of the whole.        On the contrary,      on allowing
the apparatus to stand, the gas begins slowly to expand;                  and in
thirty hours, when the ozone reactions have disappeared, the expan
sion amounts to a little more than one half of the contraction which
                                                                ‘
had previously taken place.
    Dry silver, in the   state both   of leaf and of <U+FB01>lings,   has the property
of entirely destroying      ozone,   whether  prepared by electrolysis or by
the electrical machine.      If a stream  of electrolytic ozone be passed over
silver leaf or <U+FB01>lings contained in a tube, the metal becomes              altered
in appearance where the gas comes <U+FB01>rst into contact with             it;  but no
appreciable increase of weight takes place, however long the experi
ment may be continued.          The volumetric results are similar to those
already described in the case of mercury.

                                         608
    Arsenic also destroys dry ozone, but, as it likewise combines with
 dry oxygen, its separate        action on ozone     cannot be observed         with
 precision.
    Most of the other metals examined, such               as gold, platiua, iron,
 zinc, tin, &c., are without action on dry ozone.
    Iodine, brought into contact with oxygen contracted by the elec
 tric discharge, instantly destroys the ozone reactions, and a yellowish
 solid is formed: no change of volume accompanies this action.
    Peroxide of manganese and oxide of copper have, it is well known,
 the property      of destroying     ozone,  apparently without        limit.   The
 authors have found that these oxides undergo no sensible increase of
 weight, even after the destruction of 50 or 60 milligrammes of ozone.
 The   same oxides, when brought into contact           with oxygen contracted
 by the spark, restore it to nearly its original volume.
    Hydrogen      gas,  puri<U+FB01>ed    with   care,   and perfectly     dry,   was    not
changed in volume by the action either of the electrical spark, or of
the silent discharge.
    A  similar negative result was obtained with nitrogen and the silent
 discharge;     but with the spark a very slight alteration of volume
appeared to occur, the cause of which is still under investigation.
    In the experiments now described, the electrical sparks and dis
charge were always obtained from              the   common      friction-machine.
The discharge from the induction coil,          even when passed through         two
Leyden jars, produces         very insigni<U+FB01>cant      ozone   effects.     The heat
which always accompanies this discharge, and its comparatively                feeble
tension, su<U+FB02>iciently explain its want of energy.
    All  the results recently obtained by the authors fully con<U+FB01>rm the
former experiments of one of them,* that in no case is water pro
duced by the destruction of ozone, whether prepared by electrolysis
or by the electrical discharge.         They   reserve  any further expression
of their views    as to the true relations     which exist between       ozone and
oxygen,    till they shall have an opportunity of laying the results of
this inquiry in a more complete form before the Society.

II. “Ice     Observations.”By DAVID War.x1~:n, M.D., Surgeon
     and Naturalist to the Arctic Discovery Expedition. Com
     municated      by THOMAS ANDREWS,               M.D.       Received De
     cember 16, 1858.
                                    (Abstract. )
   The contradictory statements of Dr. Sutherland and Dr. Kane, with
regard to the saltness of the ice formed from sea-water,—the former
maintaining that sea-water ice contains about one-fourth of the salt
of the original water; the latter, that if the cold be sufficiently
intense, there will be formed from sea-water a fresh and purer ele
ment <U+FB01>t for domestic use,—induced             the author to take advantage of
his position, as naturalist to the expedition now in the northern        seas,
to reinvestigate the subject.
   The changes which he has observed sea-water to undergo in
freezing are the following. When the temperature falls below
+28°'5, it     becomes    covered with a thin pellicle of ice; after some
time this pellicle becomes   thicker and presents a vertically striated
structure,   similar to that of the ordinary cakes of sal-ammoniac.
As the ice further increases in thickness, it         becomes   more compact,
but the lowest portion still retains the striated structure.          On the
surface of the ice, saline crystals, designated by the author “e<U+FB01>lo
rescence,”     soon begin to form, at <U+FB01>rst few in number and widely
separated, but gradually forming          into tufts and ultimately   covering
the whole surface.        At <U+FB01>rst, the increase in thickness of the ice is
rapid, but afterwards the rate of growth is much slower and more
uniform. The ice formed yields, on being melted, a solution differ
ing in speci<U+FB01>c gravity according to the temperature at the time of
congelation,    its density being less, the lower        the temperature     at
which the process of eongelation took place.           Although the author's
observations extended from +28°'5 to —42°, he was never able to
obtain fresh-water from sea-ice, the purest specimen being of speci<U+FB01>c
gravity 1005, and affording abundant evidence of the presence of
salts, especially of chloride of sodium, in such quantity as to render
it un<U+FB01>t for domestic purposes.
   The e<U+FB01>lorescence already referred to appeared sooner or later,
according to the temperature of the air, but generally commenced
when the ice was         -1?   of an inch thick, and continued    to form   till

                                         610
 the ice attained a thickness of about 9 inches, when, in consequence
 of the compactness of the frozen           mass,        it   ceased   to appear at the
 surface.    The lower the temperature at which the ice was formed,
 the more abundant was the efflorescence.                     Direct experiments made
 by freezing sea-water in         a large tub, showed           that the unfrozen          re
 siduum contained a considerable portion of salts expressed from the
 ice. The author therefore infers, that after the efflorescence had
 ceased to form on the surface, the saline particles were                     precipitated
 into the unfrozen liquid below.            On exposing the residual liquid
from which the ice had been separated to a freezing temperature, a
second    residuum was obtained, containing more salts than the                         first;
and by repeating the process several times, there remained finally a
strong solution of brine.
   The author endeavoured, by reversing this process, to procure
fresh-water.        He remelted the ice from sea-water and froze it again,
repeating    the operation        several times.              Ice was thus obtained,
which, when melted, gave water, having                   a density      of from 1.0025
to 1:0020.
   A    “heavy nip” having occurred in the floe near the ship afforded
an opportunity          of examining the quality of the ice at different
depths.   The thickness of the entire mass was 54 inches; the den
sity of the solution obtained by melting successive portions varied
from 1:0078 to 1-0050; those near the surface giving a liquid of
higher density than the rest.          A   specimen taken from the centre                  of
the mass was reserved for analysis.
  With regard to the “efflorescence,”                the author states that its
appearance was very different           according         as the       temperature       was
above    or below —25°.         In the former      case,       it exhibited a plumose
form, with secondary plumes branching                off; in the latter, it con
sisted of fibrous crystals varying from        3   to 2 inches in length.               This
efflorescence acts an important part in the breaking up of the floe.
From the middle of January cracks and lanes occur in the floe,
which subsequently become filled with new ice covered                     as usual      with
the saline efflorescence and a little snow.When the sun's rays fall
upon this incrustation, it melts and forms a thick liquid on the top.
This penetrates gradually through the              iceand aids greatly   break  in
ing itup. The author supposes that              a    process      of
                                                                endosmosis and
exosmosis    is,   in   fact, established through        the body       of   the ice.     A

                                      611
 similar, but    less powerful,  action is produced    by the same cause on
 the   mass  of the <U+FB02>oe itself.
     In  the arti<U+FB01>cial freezing of sea-water, the ice was found to be ver
 tically striated, and often divisible into two or more layers, while
 the under surface was always marked by <U+FB01>ne lines intersecting each
 other at de<U+FB01>nite angles. From the bottom of the vessel thin plates
 of ice formed in the unfrozen liquid. They varied in length from
 J; in.  to 2% in., and contained less salt than the ice formed on the top.
     To explain the observation of Dr. Kane       as to the freshness of ice
formed from sea-water under —30°, the author supposes that it may
have depended on the freezing of a portion of sea-water which was
covered at the time of its congelation with a stratum of fresh-water
produced      by the melting of bergs.       On the 12th of April,    1857,
whilst lying off Brown’s Island, within about          4 miles  of a glacier
surrounded       by bergs, the author observed a layer of fresh-water,
 2  or 3 inches in depth, <U+FB02>oating, like oil, on the surface of the salt
 water.     To this   cause   he attributes   the occasional  occurrence  of
 hummocks      from the upper portions of which ice perfectly free from
 salt can be obtained, while on digging deeper into these hummocks,
 the ice is always found to lose its freshness.

        for Consumption, Brompton.            Communicated by Sir B. C.
        Baonm, Bart., P.R.S.          Received December 16, 1858.
                                  ( Abstract.)
    The author gives in this communication the result of numerous in
quiries into the quantity of carbonic acid expired, and of air inspired,
with the rate of pulsation and respiration,-lst, in the whole of the
twenty-four hours, with and without, exertion and food; 2nd, the
variations from day to day, and from season to season; and 3rd, the
in<U+FB02>uence of some kinds of exertion.
    After   a description   of the apparatus employed by previous ob
servers, he describes his own apparatus and method.            This consists
of a spirometer to measure the air inspired, capable of registering
any number of cubic inches; and an analytical apparatus to abstract
     von. IX.                                                 2 1'

small dry gas-meter, of improved manufacture, and the latter con
sists  of—lst,   a desiccator   of sulphuric      acid to absorb the vapour;
2nd, a gutta-percha box, with chambers and cells, containing caustic
potash,   and offering     a super<U+FB01>cies      of 700 inches, over which the
expired air is passed,    and by which the carbonic acid is abstracted              ;
and 3rd,   0. second desiccator to retain the vapour which the expired
air had carried off from the potash box.           A  small mask is worn, so as
to prevent any air entering the lungs without <U+FB01>rst passing through               the
spirometer, and the increase in the weight of this with the connect
ing tube and the <U+FB01>rst desiccator gives the amount of vapour exhaled,
whilst the addition to the weight of the potash box and the second
desiccator gives the weight of the carbonic acid expired.                  The ba
lances employed weigh to the         T,1,—0 of a grain,  with  7  lbs. in the pan.
By this apparatus the whole of the carbonic acid was abstracted
during the act of expiration, and the experiment could be repeated
every few minutes, or continued for any number of hours, and be
made    whilst sleeping and with certain kinds of exertion.
    The amount of carbonic acid expired in the twenty-four hours                was
 determined by several sets of experiments.            Four of   these, consisting
of eight experiments, were made upon four gentlemen, on the author,
 Professor Frankland, F.R.S., Dr. Murie, and Mr. Moul, during the
 eighteen hours of the working day.             In  two of them, the whole of
the carbonic acid was collected, and in two others the experiment
was made      during  ten minutes at the commencement of each hour,
 and of each hour after the meals.             The quantity of carbonic acid
 varied from an average       of 24'274 oz. in the author to 1643 oz. in
 Professor Frankland.       The quantity evolved in light           sleep was 4'88
 and 4'99 grains per minute, and when scarcely awake 5'7, 5'94, and
 6'1 grains at different times of the night.          The author      estimates  the
 amount in profound sleep at 4'5 grains per minute; and the whole
 evolved in the six hours of the night at 1950 grains. Hence the total
 quantity of carbon evolved in the twenty-four hours, at rest, was, in
 the author, 7' 144 oz.     The   effect  of walking at various speeds is then
 given, with an estimate of the amount of exertion made by different
 classes of the community, and of the carbon which would he evolved
 with that exertion.
    The author then     states the quantity      of air inspired in the working

                                         613
 day, which varied from 583 cub. in. per minute in himself to 365
 cub. in. per minute in Professor Frankland;               the rate of respiration,
 which varied in ditferent       seasons as well as in di<U+FB01>erent       persons;    the
 depth of inspiration, from 30 cub. in. to 39'5 cub. in.           ; and the rate   of
 pulsation.      The respirations were to the pulsations as l to 4'63 in
 the youngest, and as l to 5'72 in the oldest.              One-half the product
 of the respirations into the pulsations gave nearly the number of
 cubic inches of air inspired in some of the persons, and the propor
 tion of the carbonic acid to the air inspired varied from as 1 gr. to
 547 cub. in. to as 1 gr. to 58 cub. in. The variations in the carbonic
 acid evolved in the working day gave an average maximum of 1043,
 and minimum         of 6'74 grains per minute.         The quantity increased
 a<U+FB02>zer a meal and decreased         from each meal, so that the minima were
 nearly the same, and the maxima were the greatest after breakfast
 and tea.
    The   effect  of a fast  of forty hours, with only a breakfast meal, was
 to reduce the amount of carbonic acid to 75 per cent. of that which
 was found with food       ; to render the quantity nearly uniform through
 out the day, with a little increase at the hours when food had usually
 been taken, and to cause the secretions to become alkal.ine*.
    The variations from day to day were shown to be connected with
 the relation of waste and supply on the previous day and night, so
that with good health, good night’s rest, and su<U+FB02>icient food, the
amount     of respiration was considerable on the following morning,
whilst the reverse occurred with the contrary conditions.                     Hence
the quantities were usually large on the Monday.                 Temperature was
an ever-acting cause of variation,          and caused a diminution           in the
carbonic acid as the temperature rose.
    The   e<U+FB02>'ect  of  season was to cause     a diminution      of all the respira
tory phenomena as the hot season advanced. The maximum state
was in spring, and the minimum at the end of summer, with periods
of   decrease   in June and of increase in October.            The diminution in
the author was 30 per cent. in the quantity of air, 32 per cent. in the
rate of respiration,      and 17 per cent. in the carbonic acid.            The in
<U+FB02>uence of temperature was considered in relation to season,                   and it
   * The quantity of air  was reduced 30 per cent., that of vapour in the expired air
50 per cent., the rate  of respiration was reduced   7 per  ceut., and of pulsation 6

                                                                  2r2

                                                   614
was shown that whilst sudden changes of temperature cause                                   imme
diate variation in the quantity of carbonic acid, a                               medium degree of
                                                                      no all
temperature, as            of 60°, is accompanied by                           the variations       in      the
quantity     of      carbonic acid, and that there               is            relation between any
given temperature and quantity                     of   carbonic acid           at   different seasons.
Whatever          was the degree            of   temperature, the quantity                   of   carbonic
acid, and      all   other phenomena             of   respiration, fell from the beginning
of   June    to   the beginning          of  September.          The author then described
the influence             of   atmospheric        pressure,       and stated that                  neither
temperature           nor atmospheric             pressure accounts for the seasonal
changes.
  The kinds           of   exertion which had been investigated were walking
and the treadwheel.               Walking         at   two miles per hour induced                      an   ex
                     18    gr.
             of of
halation              l          of   carbonic acid per minute, and                     at   three miles
per hour             25.83 grs.   ;    whilst the effect         of    the treadwheel             at   Cold
bath Fields Prison was                 to   increase the quantity                to   48 grs. per           mi
nute.       All    these       quantities vary with             the season,           and hence the
author recommends the adoption                        of   relative quantities, the compari
son being with the state                of    the system        at   rest, and apart from the
influence of food.
  The apparatus and various drawings were exhibited.

         Communicated by Prof. W. H. MILLER, For. Sec. R.S.
         Received    January 12, 1859.
                                                     Geneva, January 3rd, 1859.
     My dear Sir,—~The newspapers having reported that               a society  of
  English shareholders intends to lay         a second cable for transatlantic
  telegraphy,    you will allow me to give here a brief account of some
  experiments     by which    I   have succeeded    in proving     the effect   of
 pressure on electric conductibility in metallic wires.
     The method which         I   have resorted to is the one devised by
  MM. Christie     and Wheatstone, which is called the electrical bridge.
 The current of       a Bunsen’s     battery of six large cells was divided
 between the wire to be tested (a very soft copper wire 0'05 of an
 inch in diameter, and covered with gutta percha) and another con
 ductor   ; both being connected with a delicate Ruhmkor<U+FB01>"            s galvano
 meter, so that the needle remained on the zero point.              All contacts
 were made invariable by solderings.
     No sensible   e<U+FB02>'ect being determined by the pressure        of nine atmo
 spheres in a piezometer,       I made use of a press which enabled me to
 produce compressions superior to four hundred            atmospheres, conse
 quently superior to that which is suffered by an electric conductor
 immersed in the ocean,        at a depth     of 12,420 English feet.        The
 wire,   besides   its coating, was preserved against permanent defor
 mation     by two sheets     of thick gutta percha, placed between the
 steel plates which took hold of it.
    The experiments have shown—
     1°. That   a pressure   of thirty atmospheres     (a number     relative to
the sensibility of the galvanometer) diminishes the conducting power
of   a copper wire    for electricity.
    2°.  That the effect increases with the pressure.
    3°. That the diminution remains the same for each compression,
as long as the latter does not vary.
    4°. That the primitive conducting power is exactly restored when
the pressure vanishes altogether.
    Many interesting results <U+FB02>ow from         these conclusions,  which   I pro

                                             616
 pose   to examine in a future letter.             For the present, permit       me to
 add, that the fact which            I  have discovered establishes a new con
 nexion between electricity, heat, and             light: for it has     been  demon
 strated by    M.   de Senarmont—
     a. That any arti<U+FB01>cial increase of density in a non-crystallized              solid
 body diminishes,        in the direction in which it is exerted, the con
 ducting power of that body for heat.
     6. That in homogeneous media which are in a state of arti<U+FB01>cial
 molecular equilibrium,          the conformation         of the thermic ellipsoid,
 either oblate or prolate, is always corresponding to that of the
 optic one.
     I shall feel much grati<U+FB01>ed          if you deem this communication worthy
 to be laid before the Royal Society.             * *

        conducted by CHARLES S. WOOD, Esq.” By A. W. Hor
        MANN,    LL.D., F.R.S.              Received December 21, 1858.
    In his remarkable memoir*               on the action of reducing agents on
nitro-compounds,        in which Zinin <U+FB01>rst pointed out the formation of
organic bases by the substitution of hydrogen for oxygen, some expe
riments are recorded on the deportment of dinitro-naphtalin (nitro
naphtalese) with sulphuretted hydrogen.                  Zinin   states that this pro
cess gives rise to the formation of a basic compound crystallizing in
delicate copper-red needles, and yielding with acids white scaly salts.
    In  a subsequent paper-f Zinin returns to the action              of sulphuretted
hydrogen or dinitronaphtalin,             and gives a    fuller account of the pro
ducts obtained in this process.                The basic substance arising from
dinitronaphtalin       crystallizes in colourless needles of great brilliancy,
which contain
                             C1,, H, N, or     020  Hlo N2.
It   is a well-de<U+FB01>ned      basic body, which Zinin describes under                 the
name of seminaphlalidam.               From this later communication it would

appear    that the copper-red coloration         originally   observed was due
to the presence of a foreign colouring matter, which can be separated
by crystallizing the    base alternately from alcohol and water.
   Subsequently the copper-red body appears to have been observed
by Laurent", who states that the action of sulphuretted hydrogen
upon dinitronaphtalin gives rise to the formation of a carmine-red
alkali.    He did not, however, analyse this substance, and the                     dis
covery    of nitranilinet having established the existence of basic nitro
substitutes,    the compound        in question was hitherto believed to              be
nitro-naphtylamine.
   The red crystals have of late been minutely investigated in my
laboratory by Mr. Charles Wood, whose experiments have led to an
unexpected result, which        I   beg to lay before the Society.

solution of dinitronaphtalin        in weak alcoholic ammonia slowly reduces
the nitro-compound.   The process is continued for two or three hours,
during which time the greater part of the spirit distils off; the residue
is acidified with dilute sulphuric acid, and the liquid heated to ebul
lition.    The filtered liquid deposits on cooling a yellowish brown
sulphate, which may be purified by several crystallizations from boiling
water.     The addition of ammonia to the solid sulphate immediately
changes the colour to a fine dark carmine-red;                the base thus         libe
rated is washed with cold water, and finally purified by crystallization
from water or very dilute alcohol.
  Thus prepared, the substance, for which Mr. Wood proposes the
name ninaphtylamine, is a light flocculent mass, composed of little
acicular crystals, which are partially decomposed by exposure to a
temperature of 100°C.     It is difficultly soluble in boiling water, but
extremely soluble in alcohol and ether.
  In the analysis of the base            dried in vacuo over sulphuric acid,
Mr. Wood has obtained results            which lead to the formula
                                    C,   H, N, O,.
   This expression was confirmed by the examination of                 several        of
the salts of the new    base.
   Sulphate of ninaphtylamine            is obtained either by recrystallizing
the crude salt formed in the preparation of the body, or by                         dis

  Hydrochlorate               of    ninaphtylamine                 forms acicular crystals;                  they
are obtained like the sulphate, which they resemble in their general

                                          C, H, N, O, HCl,
  The platinum-salt                  of    ninaphtylamine                 forms rather soluble                 yel
lowish-brown          crystals, which               are obtained           by adding a concentrated
solution of dichloride of platinum to an alcoholic or ethereal solution
of the base. It has the usual constitution, containing
                                    C, H, N, O, HCl, PtCl.

   Expressed by these formulae, the substances in question appear to
be closely allied         to     Mr. Wood’s base; in fact, nitrosonaphtylin                                           has
the   same composition             as ninaphthylamine.                               But        a super<U+FB01>cial      com
parison of the properties of the two bodies excludes any idea of their
being identical.          The formulas of nitrosophenyline                                       and nitrosonaph
tylin have not              <U+FB01>nally established by the analysis of their
                       as yet been
compounds,     these substances, like colouring matters in general,
being of an indifferent character.                           It   is probable that they are formed
by the association of several molecules,                                      a supposition              which receives
considerable support from the discovery of ninaphthylamine.
   The formation of ninaphthylamine promises to add considerably
to the number of nitro-derivatives of the aromatic monamines. To
each of these substances probably corresponds a nitrous and a nitric
substitution-base,          but as yet we are unacquainted with a single one
in which both derivatives                  are known,                     as shown           by a glance at the

                 be
request of the Court of Directors of the East India Company, I com
piled from the General Report of the Great Trigonometrical Survey
of India, a work entitled “An Account of the Measurement of two
Sections of the Meridional           Arc of India,” executed by myself and
my assistants, an impression of which (printed in 1847) was presented
to the Royal Society.
     In reference to      the work in question,        I now    have to mention that in
the computation           of the meridional  (vide pp. 240 to 248)
                                                    triangles
there have been some errors committed in taking out the logarithms
of the twelfth triangle (p. 241) and the twentieth triangle (p. 243);
and as from the nature of that series, the purpose of which is to project
the sides of the principal triangles on the meridian, any such error

the whole series recomputed, and now forward for submission to the
Royal Society,        a   sheet containing revised synopsis (aide p. 248),
                                                a
such as     it   would have been, but for the errors adverted to, to which
it   is   my wish that the utmost publicity should be given.
 I        must here say, that    I   owe the detection and correction               of the
said errors entirely to the industry of Colonel Waugh,                     F.R.S., and
the able computing           establishment       at his disposal;     for myself     it   re
mains only to urge, that though mistakes of this nature are not cre
Iditable, but, on the contrary, much to be regretted, yet                 it   is   all but
impossible for the chief of two departments, that of Surveyor-General
of India, and that of Superintendent of the Great Trigonometrical
Survey of India, each involving   vast array of business peculiar to
                                            a
itself, to enter into all the minutiae of computation;                I   took the pre
caution to have every portion of the work gone over by two com
puters acting independently,          and   it   is   singular that both should have
fallen into the same errors.
   As the existence of these errors, in the instance of the northern of
the two sections or series A, would naturally lead to the supposition
that like errors might lurk in series       (pp. 46 to 53), an equally
                                                      B

                                             621
rigorous recomputation has been kindly instituted by Colonel Waugh
in the latter case; and           as no mistake is found therein, the synopsis                B
(p. 53) will     need no alteration on that account.
     I   have now to advert to another subject, also relating to the Work
in question.       In trigonometrical                            I
                                                      hardly mention
                                                 operations,         need
that the absolute lengths of all linear quantities depend on those of
the measured bases reduced to their equivalents at the level of the
sea, the reduction on which account may be expressed                          by    1%,   where
B    is   the measured base,       It   its mean height above the sea, and            R     the
radius of curvature:          now as we do not know a                priori the value of      It,
unless the measurements be actually made on the sea-shore,                          the only
mode of commencing                the work of computation               is   to assume      the
nearest value we are in possession of, and when the operations are
connected with the sea-coasts, to apply                  a   correction for any excess
or defect of our assumption.
     Damargida, the southernmost point included in my book of 1847,
is   an inland station, the height               of which      is    given in the general
report of my predecessor, Colonel Lambton, at 2026 feet; and as all
the triangulation      to the south of that station had been concluded in
1815, nearly four years before             I     joined the department,   had noI
choice but to refer to that as one               of my established data: my com
putations      start from the Sironj base, and on reaching Damargida                         it
appeared that the assumed value of                  h,   which I      had used in correct
ing that base line, was 2-1'5 feet in excess of what    ought to have    it
been, for which the correction      applied of
                                            is 2'578 feet to the linear
value of the terrestrial arc in synopsis B, and 2295 in synopsis A.
     Colonel    Lambt0n’s         operations,     from which          the height     of Da
margida station       is    determined, abut on the sea-coast                 at three      dif
ferent points, viz. Madras on the east coast, Mangalore on the west
coast, and Cape Comorin                  on the southernmost            extremity     of the
Peninsula,      and the       results thence derived were at that time the
most trustworthy           data
                              I      had access to.
     Subsequent to the completion of my computations,                          the western
longitudinal      series    which connects Damargida with the sea-coast
near Bombay,        was     <U+FB01>nished by Captain Jacob, then one of my as
sistants, and there             is   note on that subject at page             clxxi. of my
book of 1847, which         is, a I     presume, quite su<U+FB02>icient to prepare any

                                                  622
geodist for the probability               of   a future      correction    being needed:                  as
to Captain  Jacob’s performance, I may distinctly state that I place
the greatest con<U+FB01>dence in its accuracy, for he was furnished with an
excellent altitude            and azimuth instrument            by Dollond, which                   had a
good vertical circle, and he was not only a highly-talented                                mathema
tician, but a most careful and skilful observer.
     Since    I    left India, in December 1843, the trigonometrical                                opera
tions have abutted on the sea-coast at two other places, viz. at Cal
cutta, by the completion of my north-east longitudinal series, and at
Karachi, by Colonel Waugh’s western longitudinal                                  series   ;    so that
now there are several additional data relative to the numerical value
of   it,   which    it   becomes       necessary        to take into consideration               in the
determination         of the proper corrections to be applied to the mea
sured bases,        and the lengths of my two terrestrial arcs, as given in
synopses     B     and    A.
I     have for some time been in correspondence with Colonel Waugh
on this subject, and in due time hope to be able to. communicate
what <U+FB01>nal conclusion we arrived                     at; but, in the meanwhile,                       as   it
may be interesting to the Fellows of the Royal Society to know the
provisional state of the question,               I      here subjoin some extracts of his
last received communication.
     “By     the completion of the Calcutta meridional                       series, as well as
the north-east longitudinal               series,       we obtain   a    continued             chain of
triangulation,        extending from the sea-level               near Calcutta             along the
Calcutta      meridian         to the Sonakoda base, thence along the north
east longitudinal             series   to Dehra Dun, thence down the great arc,
and along the Bombay longitudinal series to the sea-level at Bombay.
The result of trigonometrical                    levelling    along this course of 2127
miles, comprising              1171    miles of hills, and 956 miles of plains, be
comes       veri<U+FB01>ed   ;   the discrepancy in height              being 6'76 feet or 0'00?»
foot per mile.
     “ By the completion of the great longitudinal                   series, we get another
continuous chain of triangulation                       from the sea-level near Calcutta
to the same level at Karachi.                      This chain embraces the Calcutta
meridional         series,     the north-east       longitudinal        series,     the northern
section of the great are from Dehra Dun to Sironj, and the great
longitudinal         series     from    Sironj     to    Karachi.    This         series       is    2082
miles in length, comprising 1041 miles of plains, and 1041 miles of

                                                             623
hills, and the error by trigonometrical                                       levelling         is 16:50 feet, or
0.008 foot per mile.
    “When the great Indus                              series         is finished, the sea-level will                     be
brought up to the Chueh base line, and from thence along the north
west Himalayan series to Dehra Dun. The result of this series will
give another verification, which will be especially valuable, as it is
intended to level along the flat valley of the Indus by special level
ling operations.                    It    is also proposed to carry special levelling ope
rations from Dehra Dun to Calcutta.                                           Pending           of
                                                                                                the completion
these undertakings,                       it has      been        found necessary to correct provi
sionally the results given by trigonometrical                                          levelling,            in order to
disperse the discrepancies above shown, and reduce the results                                                        of the
three data for             sea-level            near Calcutta,              Bombay, and Karachi.                        The
results, so reduced, become comparative, inter                                              se,     and are required
for record           on   the general maps.”
    The upshot             of        all   this      is,   that Colonel Waugh has provisionally
applied the following corrections                                to   the two sections                of the great arc,

   I  must call attention to the fact, that all the remarks           of Colonel
Waugh have reference to the operations carried on since 1832 by
me, himself,       and our assistants, and are quite disconnected            from
Colonel Lambton’s results to the south of Damargida, which were
deduced in the early part of 1815.             Now,    as the two sets  of opera
tions unite at Damargida,        it would   be illogical to correct the southern
portion     of the  Indian are by one value of h, and the northern por
tion by another value of h; for, manifestly, no spot on the earth’s
surface can have two distinct heights above the sea differing from
each other by 100 feet or so at the same instant.
    It  is rather a delicate matter for me to speak in terms         of comment
of the labours of my predecessor, and             I had much rather that any
body     else should    undertake     the invidious    task; but thus much is
very certain, that the instruments employed prior to 1832, were not
such as we should          use   with con<U+FB01>dence now-a-days,         whilst  those
in   use   since that period are certainly not surpassed by any in ex
istence.
    In    1842   I  was  sensibly alive to the probable inaccuracy of the
operations      between Damargida         and Cape Comorin,      and, as the only
e<U+FB02>'ectual remedy, proposed to the Government of India to revise that
work with the new instruments;              but the proposal was rejected;      so
that instead of forming,       as  it would and ought to have done, one un
broken series from Cape Comorin to the Himalayan Mountains, the                    ,
great arc of India now consists of two distinct patches; one to the
 south of Damargida for ever uncertain as to its unit of measure, and
 executed with instruments           which we should now pronounce to be
 crazy and unserviceable;          whilst the other to the north depends on
 a unit tolerably well de<U+FB01>ned, and was performed with instruments
 as perfect as can be desired.          Of course, it is not for me to offer any
 remarks      about the propriety of the decision of the Right Honour
 able the Governor-General            of India in Council,     and the Court of
 Directors     of the East India Company, of those days, in a commu
 nication of this nature, except that, as far as science is concerned,
 perhaps it will now and hereafter be lamented that all my argu
 ments for a revision were urged in vain.
     It  will appear, from what I have above           stated, that the question
 of the amount of correction to be applied            to my two sections   A   and
 B, is not yet <U+FB01>nally settled, and is still uncertain to the extent of

                                    626
 about'l0 feet; for which reason     I  have employed in the synopsis      A,
 now forwarded, the same values as before, correcting           only the ob
 vious errors to which     I have drawn attention       in the second para
 graph of this letter; at the same time        I have    endeavoured to put
 within the reach of those who interest themselves in the problem of
 the <U+FB01>gure of our planet, all the data at my command, and if any
 fresh light should hereafter be thrown       on the subject, shall be very
happy to communicate it.

 IV. “ On     the Thermodynamic         Theory of Steam-engines with
       dry saturated    Steam, and its application to practice.”          By
       W. J.MACQUORN RANKINE, C.E., LL.D., F.R.S.S.L. 8:                  E.,
       Pres. Inst. Eng. Scot., Begins Professor of Civil Engineering
       and Mechanics in the University and College of Glasgow.
       Received   December 27, 1858.
                                 (Abstract.)
    In 1849   it was demonstrated,     contemporaneously      and independ
ently, by Professor Clausius and the author         of this paper, from the
laws of thermodynamics,      that when steam or other saturated vapour
in expanding performs work, and         receives  no heat from without, a
portion of it must be lique<U+FB01>ed.
    That theoretical conclusion has since      been con<U+FB01>rmed     by practical
experience.
    The principal effect of the “ steam-jacket”      invented by Watt is to
prevent that liquefaction.
    The presence of liquid water in any considerable quantity in the
cylinder of a steam-engine acts injuriously, by taking heat from the
steam while it is being admitted, and giving out that heat to the
steam which is about to be discharged.           Most of the heat   so trans
ferred is wasted.
    The only ezact thermodynamic formulae for the work of steam
hitherto published (by the author in the Phil. Trans. 1854, and by
Professor Clausius    in Poggendor<U+FB01>"s      ‘Annalen,’ I856),     are adapted
to steam which receives no heat in expanding.
    The present paper, after recapitulating       the general equation of
thermodynamics,     and the special formulae for the pressure, volume,

                                        627
and latent heat of steam,         proceeds  to the investigation of the exact
formulae for the work of steam which is supplied during               its expan
sion with just enough of heat to prevent any appreciable portion of
it from condensing, for the expenditure of heat in producing                 and
using that steam, and for its e<U+FB01>iciency in producing motive power.
    There is explained      a convenient   approximation      to the exact for
mulae, founded        on the facts, that for initial pressures of steam of
from    30    to   120 lbs.  on the square inch (including          atmospheric
pressure), and for ratios of expansion up to sixteen, the pressure of
saturated steam varies nearly as the seventeenth power of the six
teenth root of its density, and that          the expenditure of heat in an
engine in which        dry saturated steam     is used, expressed    in units of
energy, is nearly equal to <U+FB01>fteen-and-a-half times the product of the
initial pressure and volume of the steam expended.
    Lastly, there are given examples of the application of the formula
to the engines of three steam-vessels lately experimented on by the
author.       The displacements of those ships are from 700 to 1100
tons; the indicated horse-power of their engines from 226 to H80;
the initial absolute pressures of steam in their cylinders range from
32 to    108%    lb. on the square inch, and the ratios of expansion from
4 to 16.       In each case the difference between the results of calcula
tion and experiment is within the limits of error of observation, and
ranges from           to 7}“; of the actual work of the steam.
    The author has computed Tables of the results of the formulae,
exact and approximate, which are now in the course of being printed.

to   the voltaic combination that               I        had adopted for certain telegraphic
purposes; namely, zinc-graphite.                            Graphite        in     its   crude state had
for some years                          great service                 me, especially for batteries

Since the date          of   that notice,     I     have considerably increased the value

                                               629
  My <U+FB01>rst crude graphite battery of twelve pairs of plates was set
up on April 5th, 1849, for working the telegraph from my residence
atTonbridge to the Telegraph Otlice about a mile distant.                                    It   was
charged with sand saturated with diluted acid ; and had not                            been dis
mounted in March 1851, when                    I                    During the
                                                    changed my abode.
interval, the sand was            from time to time moistened with acid water or
water only.            The plates in this   case had been          roughly chipped out and
rubbed        on stone into something              like shape.         In     the mean time          I
had some sets of plates cut at the Locomotive                          Works. Ashford, and
was thus enabled to obtain further results.                        I   forwarded a graphite
battery to the Great Exhibition                    in 1851, for which           a prize      medal
was awarded.               The introduction          of graphite        into    anything like
general use was for a long period no easy matter, on account of the
di<U+FB02>iculty of <U+FB01>nding any one who would undertake to cut it into
plates, its hardness destroying the tools; and the then limited de
mand did not encourage any one to construct                            special machinery for
the purpose.             My wants at length reached the                 ear   of Mr.   J. Robin
son of Everton, Liverpool, who took the matter thoroughly in hand,
and has succeeded             perfectly in cutting           plates into any form and to
comparatively any size, at a very moderate cost, for which                            I am much
indebted to him.              I   have before me plates 12 inches                 X    10 inches,
of smooth texture and uniform thickness, and                             have    seen some          of
double that size.
  The plates in common use for bell signals are 7} inches x 3 inches
and  inch thick, of which about 2000 are in daily use on the South
       -3-
Eastern Railway, and the greater portion of these are now platinized.
The plates are delivered to me in their crude state, that     to say,                  is
they      are merely cut          into form.        Immediately         on arrival      they are
placed in         a    stone pan, and covered with             a   mixture of     1    sulphuric
acid   +     4    water, in which they are allowed to remain for three or
four days or more. They are taken out as required, and are washed
under tap of running water; this operation dissolves out any foreign
          a
matter that might be pernicious                     in   a   voltaic combination            wherein
sulphuric acid           was employed   ;   they are then partially dried.                   A    hole
for   a   rivet   is   next drilled in the middle, near the top of each plate
a belt       of varnish one inch wide        is     applied to the top on both sides of
each      plate-a        blank one inch square, having the rivet hole for its
centre, being left unvarnished on each side—electrotype                                copper       is
                                                                              2U2

                                       630
then deposited on the blank square in the usual way. The deposited
metal is then tinned, no part of the copper being left bare;             a con
necting slip of copper,        6 inches    x   1  inch is prepared and also
entirely tinned   ;  this is riveted to the graphite plate with a copper
rivet, also tinned.       The soldering iron is now applied, and a little
solder run in between the two surfaces.            By thus protecting all the
exposed copper with tin, the formation of sulphate of copper and its
attendant inconveniencies are prevented.          The plate  is now platinized.
   A  mixture of     l sulphuric acid +      10 water is placed in a vertical
glass cell, to this are added a few crystals of chloride of platinum         till
the solution presents a faint straw colour.           The battery power     em
ployed for platinizing is three cells of platinized graphite and zinc.
The positive electrode is platinum or graphite itself, and ispresented
to both sides of the plate that is to be platinized.             The action is
allowed to go on for about twenty minutes.              Each  <U+FB01>nished plate is
tested as to its power      of liberating the hydrogen of electrolysis, by
placing it in acid water in contact with an amalgamated zinc plate.
   I have drawn out the above description in the presence of our
assistant, who attends to this department of the telegraph establish
ment, in order to be correct in the small details.
   The battery-cells for the plates above described are quart jars of
stone-ware that resists acid.         The exciting solution is 1 sulphuric
acid + 8 to 12 water.          Zinc plates are riveted to the other end of
the copper connecting slip, also with tin rivets.         The zinc is strongly
amalgamated.        It is dipped in a vessel     containing 1 sulphuric acid
 + 4 water, and after      a few seconds,    more or less, is withdrawn     and
thrust in its then condition into       a trough    of mercury, and set aside
to drain.    On the following day it is treated in a similar manner.
When the batteries       are being  put together, and before the zincs       are
placed in the jars, the foot      of each is placed in    a trough  or slipper
of gutta percha, 3 inches by % inch, containing about a couple of
ounces of mercury.        A battery thus carefully prepared will stand for
an inde<U+FB01>nitely long period with little perceptible waste, and be ready
for use at all times.      Under ordinary circumstances it is not        neces
sary to dismount        the batteries employed        for telegraph   signaling
more than once a year.         Mercury is added during the interval, and
the jars are <U+FB01>lled up as     occasion requires. The greater portion of the
mercury is recovered:        when old plates come        home, a considerable

                                                          631
quantity of rich amalgam is scraped from the plates;                                                      this       is placed
in jars of acid water, and                  a few pieces           of graphite                are thrown                 in; the
electro-chemical action makes the amalgam poorer of zinc, and mer
cury is easily expressed.                      By continuing                  the operation, more mer
cury, to the amount in all of nearly three-fourths,                                               is recovered.
  As   an illustration of the economic importance of this material in
applied science, I am informed that the silver plates of the batteries
constructed for the Atlantic Telegraph cost £2520 or more. On my
having directed the attention of the Company to graphite as a sub
stitute for silver, a set of plates were ordered, equal in number and
size, which were                supplied         (furnished with electrotype copper and
connecting wires) for £216.
   The following Table illustrates                              the effective working powers of
platinized graphite,                       like circumstances, with pla

the improbability attaching                    to   the old view, which regarded                            as   ovi
               mollusca two canals, which lying one
                                                                                at on

body, yet communicate freely with                         each other                    no   great distance
from their termination, and which                         lie   far   away from the lower                        seg
ment      of   the intestinal          tube.        The inhalant aquiferous orifices are
considered        to    be   indicated         bya    belt      of   parasitic animals impacted
in   the foot tissue,        as   represented        in   one    of   the figures.

   2.  In the   second    part of the communication,          the structures   are
indicated  which the authors hold            to   be the true oviducts.       One
large band which       is seen at the spawning           season  as a prominent
ridge projecting    into the calibre of the lower segment of the intes
tinal tube, and two smaller ones, which are traceable from the com
mencement of the intestine down to a point where its upper coils
are in close proximity to that part of its lower segment where the
former   band ends      in a club-shaped        dilatation,  are  shown to dis
charge this function.       The method of dissection to           be adopted   for
the demonstration of these structures is given at some length, and
the following    arguments are adduced in support of the view which
regards them as oviducts.         A   <U+FB01>ne injection     thrown into the largest
of the bands in question is        seen   to pass into the ovary, and is re
cognizable under the microscope             as contained    within the limitary
membrane of its ultimate         follicles.     Its distribution,   therefore, as
detectable at once by the naked eye and by the microscope, con
trasts strongly with that of     a similar injection thrown in by either of
the aquiferous     ori<U+FB01>ces.     Secondly: The condition            of distention,
prominence, and intumescence of this band, coincides with similar
conditions   in the ovary    ; and from an acquaintance with the condi
tion of the branchial marsupium’s contents we are enabled always to
predict what will be found to be that of this band.                 Thirdly: At
periods when ova are being rapidly secreted               by the ovary, ova are
to be found at all points within the whole length of these three
bands.    The double oviduct        at the oral and the single at the anal
extremity of the Lamellibranchiata,           is what our knowledge      of their
development would lead us to anticipate;             and the close connexion    of
the principal oviduct with that latter outlet, and with the lower
segment of the intestinal      tube, brings the anatomy of these bivalve
mollusks   into exact correspondence with that of higher tribes in the
 same series.
   What is said of the ovarian secretion and outlets, applies, mutatis
mutandis, to the testicular.

 common fresh-water muscle, Anodonta              Cygnea.

  In   the Proceedings of the Royal Society (vol.                                       p.       118),  I      stated
that   by   the action        of   nitrous acid             on   aniline   I     had obtained ammonia
and nitrophenasic acid; since then
                                                                                        as on

the organic bases with the same reagent,                                   as   well        with nitric acid,
and with binoxide    manganese and sulphuric acid; and
                              of                                                                      I    will now
shortly enumerate the experiments.
                    1.   Action        of     Nitrous Acid            on    Amylaniline.
                                                                                                                on    by
                                   in C.
  The dilute solution                         the nitrate        of   amylaniline was acted
                                         of
nitrous acid        at   100°             for        12   hours.       Amylamiline and ammonia
were obtained,           but              quantities         too      small        to       be   quantitatively
determined.
                    2.   Action         of     Nitric Acid            on   Amylaniline.
  Amylaniline was boiled with dilute nitric acid
                                                                                                                      by of
                                                                                       (1   part acid          to
                                                                                                                2
water) until the reaction began, which was immediately stopped
adding      cold water         to      the solution.               This was filtered when cold
from the nitrophenasic                        acid, and after potash had been added,                                 it
was again filtered            to   separate any undecomposed amylaniline.                                           The
filtrate was distilled,                the distillate             redistilled          per       ascensum           into
hydrochloric acid,             and the               acid    solution           evaporated            to   dryness.
The residue was then extracted with absolute alcohol, and the                                                        fil
trate evaporated          to    dryness.              This operation was repeated four                                or
five times.         A    platinum-salt" made with the chloride, which was
soluble     in     absolute alcohol, gave 33:55 per cent, platinum.                                                 The
chloroplatinate          of   amylamine            requires 33.66 per cent. The plati
num-salt      of that chloride                  which was insoluble    absolute alcoholin
gave 43.9 per cent. platinum.                               The chloroplatinate                    of      ammonia
requires 44.2 per cent.
  The above reaction may                        be   explained         as   follows:

   The    free  nitric acid present converts the phenylic alcohol into
nitrophenasic acid, and the amylic alcohol into nitrite of amyl.
                3. Action   of Nitric Acid on Ethylaniline.
   Ethylaniline was treated in the       same manner as amylaniline.    The
platinum-salt     of the chloride which was soluble in absolute alcohol
gave in two experiments 39.6 and 39.5 per cent. platinum.               The
percentage     of platinum in chloroplatinate    of ethylamine is 39:3.
    The platinum-salt      of the chloride which was insoluble in abso
lute alcohol      gave 44 per cent. platinum,       which   agrees  with the
number required for the chloroplatinate         of ammonia.
                4. Action   of Nitric Acid   on Diethylaniline.
    Diethylaniline was treated with dilute nitric acid (1 part of acid to
 4 of water), and heated     till the temperature reached 54°C., when,
 on being left to itself, it soon became turbid, and the temperature
rose about 10°C. After a while the solution cleared itself again,
but remained very dark. When quite cold, it was filtered from the
nitrophenasic      acid, and the filtrate was treated in the same manner
as described in Experiment         2.   The solution of the chlorides (5-6
grms. were obtained from about 50 of diethylaniline),            which  were
 soluble in absolute alcohol, was partially precipitated with bichloride
 of platinum (precipitate No. 1); then another portion was precipi
tated, which was not used; after this, more bichloride             was added
 (precipitate No.     2);  and lastly, an excess of bichloride was added
 (precipitate No. 3).      The platinum found in the three precipitates

                No.  1.               No. 2.              No. 3.
           39.2 per cent.        35.5 per cent.      35.4 per cent.
    The chloroplatinate of ethylamine contains 39.3 per cent, and of
 diethylamine 35.3 per cent. platinum.          A platinum-salt made with
 chloride insoluble in absolute alcohol, gave 44.2 per cent. platinum,
 which is exactly the amount contained in the chloroplatinate             of
 ammonia.

    As in the   case  of amylaniline, the phenylic alcohol and the alcohol
are converted into nitrophenasic acid and nitrite of ethyl; the am
monia being in both       cases  partially oxidized.
5. Action    of Binoxide of    Manganese and Sulphuric        Acid on  Aniline.
    Aniline was dissolved in     an excess   of dilute sulphuric acid (1 part
of acid to   6  of water) and heated to boiling, when         a small  quantity
of binoxide of     manganese     was added.     The reaction was allowed to
continue for 3 or 4 minutes, and it was stopped by cooling the flask
in water. Potash was then added, and the solution filtered. The
filtrate was distilled   as described in experiment 2, and the distillate
evaporated to dryness with hydrochloric acid, and extracted with            ab
solute alcohol, to dissolve any chloride of aniline present.           A plati
num-salt made from the chloride, insoluble in absolute alcohol, gave
44.0 per cent. platinum,        which corresponds to the platinum in the
chloroplatinate     of ammonia.
      6. Action   of  Binoxide   of Manganese and Sulphuric Acid on
                                 Diethylaniline.
    Diethylaniline was treated in the      same manner as aniline,     but only
for about one minute.         Potash was added, &c., as in the foregoing
experiment.       The platinum-salt       partially precipitated,   as  in Ex
periment 4, from the chloride soluble in absolute alcohol, gave:—
          Precipitate No. 1.                    Precipitate No. 2.
           37.6 per cent.                  35.4 per cent. platinum.
    No.   1 appears to be only a mixture           of the chloroplatinates   of
ethylamine and diethylamine; the quantity of salt first precipitated
being too small to be properly recrystallized (on account of former
experiments     showing that the quantity         of ethylamine present was
very small).       No. 2 corresponds with diethylamine, and of this salt

                                                                   638
there was a large quantity,                                 so     that it was recrystallized twice.                             A
platinum-salt                  made          from the chloride                    insoluble in absolute alcohol
(of which there was only a very small quantity), gave 44.3 per
cent. platinum, which is almost the same as the amount in chloro
platinate              of ammonia.            No phenylic alcohol was found nor any of
its   compounds;                       and according       experiment to Long (not yet
                                                                            an                       of

exhibition; also that the action of food is in two degrees; viz. that
which sustains the respiratory        changes to the minimum          line (or
that which     occurs with complete       abstinence),    and that which      is
observed as the maximum          point to which the respiratory function
is increased after ordinary meals. His aim in this communication
was to show the variations in the influence of food between these
two lines.     His method of inquiry was to take a moderate quan
 tity of a single article of food alone, before breakfast, whilst the
body was at rest and in the sitting posture, and to determine the
influence   every ten or fifteen minutes        during a period of about
 two hours.      He noted the amount of carbonic acid exhaled and
 of air inhaled, with the rate of respiration and pulsation, and also
 the temperature and the barometric pressure of the atmosphere.
 The apparatus employed was that described in his former Paper,
 and the gentlemen who submitted           themselves to the investigation
 were chiefly the author      and   Mr. Moul, with Professor Frankland,
 F.R.S., Mr. Hoffman, and Mr. Reid, who engaged in a few experi
 mentS.
    The following foods were subjected to inquiry:—
     1. The starch series, viz. arrowroot,    arrowroot and butter,      arrow
 root and sugar, commercial starch, wheat starch, gluten, bread, oat
 meal, rice, rice and butter, potato.
     2. The fat  series, viz. butter, olive oil, cod-liver oil.
     3. Sugars, viz. cane sugar,   cane sugar and butter, cane sugar       with
 acids and alkalies, grape sugar, sugar of milk.
    4. The milk series (cows' milk), viz.        new   milk, skimmed milk,
 casein, casein and lactic acid, lactic acid, sugar        of milk and lactic
 acid, cream.
     5. Alcohols, viz. alcohol, brandy, whisky, gin, rum, sherry wine,
 port wine, stout, and ale.
     6. The tea series, viz.    tea, green and black,        hot and cold, in
 various quantities, and with acids and alkalies; coffee, coffee-leaves,
 chichory, and cocoa.
     7.  Some   other  nitrogenous    substances,    viz.   gelatin, albumen,
 fibrine, almond-emulsion.
     The author found that pure starch scarcely increased the amount
 of carbonic acid evolved, but the combination of starch with gluten
 and sugar in the cereals caused an increase of about 2 grains per

                                                  640
minute.        Wheat flour, oatmeal, and rice had similar effects, but
potato had a less enduring influence.
  Fats    lessened        the amount of carbonic acid evolved, and when taken
with starch, the cereals, or sugar, somewhat                           lessened            their power to
produce carbonic acid.                  Fats increased pulsation.
  Sugars increased the carbonic acid evolved to the maximum extent
of from      1} to 23 grains per minute                    in about half an hour.                              Cane
sugar was more powerful                   than milk sugar, and still more so than
grape sugar.          Acids increased the maximum influence of sugar.
  Milk      increased both the pulsation and the carbonic acid, and the
latter to a maximum                of nearly 2 grains per minute.                          All the com
ponent elements except lactic acid had a similar influence,                                               but    new
milk was much more powerful than any of                                    its   elements separately,
or    than any artificial              combination      of   its      elements.            The effect              of
milk differed        in      degree, and     of   casein    in   direction, upon the author
and Mr. Moul.
     Tea and     coffee increased the production                       of    carbonic acid                 to    the
extent      of   from        13   to
                                  3     grains per minute.           Tea was more powerful
than coffee, and coffee than chichory.                             Cocoa was   powerful    as                      as
coffee.      Coffee-leaves lessened               the amount of carbonic acid.                                 Acids
added     to   tea rendered        it   more stimulating, and alkalies made                               it    more
soothing.
     Alcohols differed            in   their effect, according both                   to   different kinds
and samples          of   the same kind.           Spirits    of      wine always increased the
quantity       of   carbonic acid evolved
                                                    to
                                                    a       maximum               of   less than           1   grain

per minute.           Rum commonly increased                          and sometimes                to     13    grain
per minute.        Ale and stout increased       upwards              to                    of    1   grain per
               Sherry wine  oz.) commonly slightly increased                                               Brandy

and gin, and particularly the latter, always decreased       Whisky
varied    in
         its effects. The inhalation of the volatile elements of wine
and spirits, and particularly                of   fine old port wine, lessened the quan
tity   of   carbonic acid, and increased the amount                              of   vapour exhaled.
     Gluten, casein, gelatin, albumen, and fibrin increased the amount
 of  carbonic acid exhaled, the two former    about    grain per minute,
                                                                 to               1
and the last          to     about        grain per minute.                  Almond-emulsion did
not increase it.
     From      these facts the author infers that there                           is   a   class          of foods
 which might            be   called “excito-respiratory;”                  a     class which embraces

                                       641
 nearly all nitrogenous foods, and is almost entirely composed of these
 substances.
    The non-ezcitants     are starch, fat, some alcohols, and coffee-leaves.
    The respiratory ezcitanla      are sugar,   milk, the cereals,  potato, tea,
 coffee, chichory,   cocoa, alcohol, rum, ales, some wines, gluten, casein,
 gelatin, <U+FB01>brin, and albumen.
    Of the hydrocarbons, sugar acted very differently from starch and
 fat.
    All  the “ respiratory excitants” increased the depth, but not the
rate of respiration.
    Some of them acted with great rapidity; as, for example, sugar
and tea, which sometimes caused an increase of 1 grain of carbonic
acid per minute in from <U+FB01>ve to eight minutes.               Others, as gluten
and casein,     acted  with  less rapidity.     In many,  as tea and gluten,
there was not a proportionate        increase in the carbonic acid with in
crease    in the quantity of the “excitant.”          Some of them, as tea,
produced     much     greater effect   when a small dose was frequently
repeated, than when the whole            quantity   was given at once,      and
caused a much greater evolution of carbon than they supplied.               The
duration of the increase was very different with different foods, but
that with sugar was the least, and then that with tea, while that
with the    cereals   and rum and milk was the greatest.           The amount
of carbonic acid progressively increased at          each  examination     until
the maximum         was  attained; after which it remained nearly           sta
tionary for   some time, as with the cereals,     or subsided rapidly to the
basis quantity, as with sugar.
    The paper     was illustrated   by a series    of diagrams, and     accom
panied by tables.

  I.  “Statement of Facts relating to the Discovery of the             Com
        position of Water by the Hon. H. CAvENDIsH.”                    In a
        Letter from   J. J.   BENNETT, Esq., F.R.S., to          Sir B.    C.
        BRoDIE, Bart., P.R.S., dated February 12, 1859.            Received
        February 14, 1859.
     Since the death of our late excellent and lamented friend           Mr.
 Robert Brown, several appeals have been made to his executors to
 publish certain evidence presumed to have         been   in his possession
 relating to the much-agitated question      of the priority of Cavendish
 or Watt in the discovery   of the composition of water.      As the execu
 tor to whom Mr. Brown entrusted his papers, and having been for
 many years honoured with his entire confidence,         I feel called upon
 to respond to these appeals, and       I therefore request that you will
 kindly lay before a Meeting of the Royal Society the following brief
 statement on the subject.
     The date and nature of Cavendish's communication to Priestley
 have always been considered as essential elements in the determina
 tion   of the question;  and   it was the evidence which Mr. Brown
 possessed   in regard to these particulars,     which, in his estimation,
 “placed Cavendish’s claims      as the discoverer   of the composition of
water beyond dispute.”       That    evidence,  however, was not derived
from any unpublished      document, but formed part         of a section  of
 Deluc's   “Idées sur la Météorologie,” which although especially
 entitled,-“Anecdotes relatives à la découverte de l'Eau sous la
Jorme d'Air,”-appears entirely to have         escaped the notice   of those

                                                                  643
who have advocated Cavendish's claims.                                                  It   is the more conclusive
as coming from Deluc,                         the    “ami zélé,”                 as he         justly terms himself,
of Watt, and who, in relation to this question, believed himself “à
                                                         as les
portée d'en connoitre toutes                                      circonstances.”
     The testimony                 of   Deluc       is            follows:–

     In   this communication made                                 by   Cavendish             to   Priestley the theory
of    the composition                   of    water       is       clearly indicated.                    The two          gases
(known    have been hydrogen and oxygen) were mixed together
            to                                                                                                                  in
due proportion, and     means             by
                                 the electric spark were entirely  of
converted into water.                        Referring             to   one    of       Cavendish's experiments,
as    recorded        in      his journal, Lord Jeffrey, the most candid and
judicious       of    Watt's advocates, has said:                                       “if       he

      In   this communication the author laid before the Society the par.
ticulars      of   a   series    of    experiments, having for their object                                    to   discover
 what influence          is   exerted                by   ordinary light,          by     the different coloured
 rays, and         by   darkness             on      the development, growth, and nutrition                                   of

    After referring to the experiments of Edwards, Higginbottom,
E. Forbes, Morren, Wohler, llannon, Moleschott, and Béclard, the
results    of which   were  shown to be somewhat contradictory,          the
author described the precautions taken by himself to avoid sources
 of fallacy.
    The original experiments detailed in this Paper were conducted in
the years 1855, 1856, 1857, I858.         The subjects selected were the
Ova and Larvae of the Silkworm (Bombyz mori) and of the Frog( Rana
temporaria). A comparative experiment in the vegetable kingdom
was also made on the Sweet Pea        (Lathyrus     odoratus).   An appa
ratus contrived for the experiments on Tadpoles         was described   and
<U+FB01>gured; it secured the following desiderata :
    1. That each of six compartments or cells should      be supplied  with
water from the same source, at the same time, subject to the same
changes, and capable of being refreshed without interfering        with the
 cells.
    2. That each of the cells should be placed in the same condition
with respect to the supply of air and of food.
    3. That during exposure for examination           of the animals, the
whole     series should  be opened the same     length of time and to the
 same extent.
    4. That each cell should receive     no light but that transmitted by
 its proper cover.
    One of these six cells was open to the air and to light      ;  one was
 covered with ordinary white glass; one was made completely dark
 by a covering of blackened opaque glass;      one was covered  with blue,
one with greenish yellow, and one with red glass.           The transmit
ting and absorbing powers of these glasses were detailed from expe
riments made upon them by Mr. Cornelius Hanbury, jnn., and by
 the author.
    The apparatus     used for the Silkworms was, in all essential par
 ticulars, the same as that for the Tadpoles,     only without water.
    A   tabulated analysis of the daily journal kept during the experi
 ments was given, and its separate      items compared and discussed;
 after which the author concluded his Paperwith the following résumé.
    “  If we may venture to reason on so small a number        of observa
 tions, so far as the results of these    experiments are concerned, the
 following propositions may    be advanced.
                                                             2x2

                                      646
     “All   other conditions   being the same, (1.) The Ova         of  Insects
are not directly influenced in their development by white light, by
 the different coloured rays, or by darkness.
     “(2.)   The Larvae   of Insects are not directly influenced in their
 development, growth, nutrition,       or metamorphoses by white light,
 by the different coloured rays, or by darkness.
     “(3.)  The Larvae  of Batrachia Reptiles are not directly influenced
in their development, growth, nutrition, or metamorphoses by white
 light, by the different coloured rays, or by darkness.
     “(4.)   The Materials necessary     to the Colour   of Insects and Rep
 tiles are prepared equally under the influence        of white light, of the
 different coloured rays, and of darkness.”
     These results are so opposed to preconceived ideas upon the           sub
ject to which they relate, that they cannot fail to excite some surprise
 and incredulity; when, however, they are carefully considered, they
 assume a theoretical    probability,   which assists   us  in believing that
the practical results are without fallacy.
     (a.) With regard to the     development    of the  ovum, when we      con
 sider the unity   of plan which appears to preside over the germs of
the simplest and of the most complicated             forms, and the infinite
 variety   of external conditions in which these germs are placed
 throughout the animal kingdom, we are led to the conclusion that
 their development must be      so arranged as to be independent         of the
 direct influence of light.
     (b.) That after emerging from the          ovum the animal is not di
rectly influenced by    light,  is more difficult, at first, to believe, be
cause experience seems to have taught             us that  “to   live without
light is to live without health;”       but this familiar fact may be         at
 once disposed    of in the argument and explained by its coincident,
 that,   under ordinary    circumstances,    the admission of light is       in
 separably connected with,
        1. The regulation   of external temperature.
        2. The free circulation of a respiratory medium.
        3. Those   processes of vegetable life and      of inorganic   change
     upon which the      proper    condition   of the respiratory     medium
     depends.
     Speaking generally then,    it must  be admitted that   light is essential
 to the development, growth, and nutrition         of animals, but only in

                                               647
 directly.        In the foregoing experiments, the usual coincidents of
 light,    a   proper supply of food, a due aération of the respiratory
 medium,            a properly     regulated   external temperature,           &c. having
 been provided           in   each cell, the direct   influence of light only being
 changed, no corresponding change occurred in the animal life.
    In     the vegetable kingdom the case is quite different, and the                   ex
 periments on Lathyrus odoratus recorded in this paper demonstrate
 again, what has been shown by numerous other experimenters, that
 light as a direct agent is essential to the nutritive processes of
 plants. An interesting exception occurs, however, in the vegetable
 kingdom, which serves to strengthen the probability that the con
clusions arrived at concerning animals are correct, viz. that fungi—
which derive their nutriment, like animals, from organic compounds
already          for them—perform
               prepared               their vital functions without
dependence on the influence of light.
  Under the head of colour, it would seem that the familiar phe
momenon         of etiolation witnessed in plants which have been deprived
of light,      has led to erroneous anticipations           as to the effect          which
alterations          of light would produce upon the development of the
colouring materials in animals.
   In  the experiments here recorded, it is seen that neither white
light, nor the different coloured rays, nor darkness altered the de
velopment of those materials, necessary                to the exhibitionof colour,
when the animal was seen in ordinary light.                    The experiments of
Dr. Gladstone, on plants, also show that the development of colouring
matter in the petals of flowers is independent of the influence of
light; that flowers raised under the different coloured rays and in
darkness have the same colour in their petals as when raised in                         or
dinary light.           Thus,    even    in vegetables, etiolation         is confined to
those parts of the plant which depend for their colour upon the
condition of the chlorophyl,             to the green appearance           of which   some
portion of the solar beam is evidently essential.
  Although, therefore, at first sight, the results of my experiments
under the head  of colour may appear questionable, I think we must
rather throw the question upon the correctness of our preconceived
notions     on the subject;            and the facts elicited by           Prof. Edward
                                                                  of all

                                                                648
                    cannot,   I   think,   be taken as evidence        against the correctness          of m
                    observations.      On the other hand, the results of my experiments
                    may be found to put         a new    construction upon the facts observed b
                    Prof. Forbes.  He discovered that increased depth of sea corre
                    sponds with diminished light, and that both of these conditions
                    again correspond with peculiar changes in colour, and ultimately
            i       with loss of colour in the shells inhabiting              these depths;         but ther
    '   l
                    is no evidence         to show that these colourless shells have develope
                    any materials capable of manifesting               colour   after exposure to th
        .vI‘i       in<U+FB02>uence of light;         whereas    my own and other              experiments show
                    that the etiolated stalks and leaves of plants speedily manifest th
                    characteristic colour of the chlorophyl             if placed     in the sun’s rays.
                       So far, therefore, as our present knowledge on the subject justi

   III.   “On    the Intensification     of Sound through Solid Bodies
       by the interposition of Water between them and the distal
       extremities of Hearing-Tubes.”          By S. Scott Alison, M.D.,
       Assistant-Physician        to the Hospital for Consumption.
       Communicated       by Dr. TYNDALL.          Received January 20,
       1859.
                                   (Abstract.)
    In this  Paper the author gives an account       of various experiments
which he has recently made on sounds proceeding through solid
bodies.    He has found that sounds which are faint, when heard by
a hearing-tube     applied   directly  to solid sounding     bodies, become
augmented when water is interposed between            these bodies and the
distal extremity    of the hearing-tube.      He has been able, by the   em
ployment of water, to hear the sound of a solid body, such              as a
table, which,     without  this medium, has      been   inaudible.   Experi
ments have been made upon water in various amounts and in different
conditions.     Thus   a very  thin layer,  a mere  ring round the edge of
the hearing-tube, masses of water in larger or smaller vessels, and a
bag of water, have been employed. The results have been the same
as regards augmentation.         The degree of augmentation was greatest
when the hearing-tube        was immersed freely in water.         In experi
 menting    upon water in vessels,       it was found necessary to close
 the extremity of the tube to be immersed, by tying over it a piece of
 bladder or thin india-rubber; for the entrance of water into the in
 terior interfered greatly with the augmentation.
     The effect of water in augmenting sound is materially reduced          if
 even a small amount of solid material be interposed between the
 water employed       and the mouth      of the hearing-tube.      A piece of
 wood, not much thicker than a paper-cutter,            materially interferes
 with the augmenting power of water.
     The augmentation of sound thus obtained by water seems to be
  due to the complete fitting of the liquid on the solid body and also
 round the mouth of the hearing-tube, whereby the column of air
 is thoroughly enclosed; also to the less impediment to the vibrations
  of the instrument when held in contact with water, than when held

                                                       650
in contact with a solid body, the water yielding in a greater                                                 degree
than a solid.
  The mode of judging of the augmentation was twofold: 1st,                                                        one
sensation was compared with another perceived by the same ear,                                                     the
one sensation following                  immediately upon the other; 2nd, the                                      dif
ferential stethophone was employed, by which two impressions                                                       are
simultaneously             made upon              the two         ears;       in which           case,        if   one
impression           be    materially            greater than           the        other, sound is                 per
ceived in that ear only on which the greater impression                                                  is made.
To    obtain the advantage                  of   the differential stethophone,—or                          “Pho
noscope,” as          it might here perhaps be more correctly designated—
when sounds at some distance from the ear were being examined,                                                      its
length was increased                   by   the addition          of   long tubes         of    india-rubber.
     Experiments           were made upon other liquids besides water, such                                          as
mercury and ether.
  Other materials besides liquids                           were found          to   afford     a   similar        in
tensification         of   sound from solid bodies, such                            as   laminae         of   gutta
percha,              of   india-rubber,                                of    writing paper, but the
           of or
                                                  and sheets
amount          augmentation was less.
  The hearing-tubes employed were various.                                         Many        of   the experi
ments were performed with the author's ordinary differential stetho
phone,     an   instrument described                   in   No.    31   of   the ‘Proceedings                 of   the
Royal Society.              India-rubber tubes fitted with ivory ear-knobs, and
with wooden           or   glass cups (the size                of      the cup       or   object-extremity
of   ordinary        stethoscopes), and having                     an   ear-extremity               to   pass into
the meatus, and brass tubes, were also           turn employed.        in                                     Tubes
closed    at   their distal extremity with solid material, such                                          as   glass,
did not answer             so   well   as   those closed with membrane.
  The water-bag increases the impression conveyed                                         to   the ear        by   the
wooden stethoscope,                          be    placed between             the flat ear-piece and

                                       it
the external ear.                      may        be   employed alone               to    reinforce sound.
The name        of    Hydrophone has               been given           to   it.
 A     postscript         is    added,      in   which the author records                      an   experiment
made     on   the bank          of   the Serpentine river.    sound produced upon
                                                                            A

                                                   the water when     could not          it                         be
heard    at     an   equal distance               on   the ground,       if     the two limbs                 of   the
differential stethophone were employed simultaneously.

than that upon the ear connected with the same water by means of
a solid rod. When both tube and solid rod were employed simul
taneously,      sound was heard in that ear only supplied with the tube
                                February 24, 1859.

      a note* on the deportment of dibromide of ethylene with tri

had    been unable to      fix by experiment.
     I have continued      the study   of this substance, which has led to the
following results.
     All   attempts to eliminate the bromide in question by frequently
recrystallizing the direct product of the action of dibromide of               ethyl
eme    on triethylphosphine       have entirely failed.        Considerable    sacri

crops of crystallization        taught me nothing,         except that the body

which       I   endeavoured to grasp is most abundantly                              produced when
the triethylphosphine                 is rather in excess.          Indeed,         it would        appear,
that under those conditions, the bromide in question constitutes the
principal product of the reaction.
    Not more successful                 was an attempt to increase the chances                             of
separation by reducing the number of the bromides.
    As   I      have previously            stated, treatment with oxide                   of silver de
stroys the triethylated-bromethylene-phosphonium,                                   converting   it into
a basic compound, which contains                           no longer any bromine, whilst
the same agent transforms the bromide of triethylphosphonium into
the oxide         of argento-triethylphosphonium,                    and the dioxide                  of tri
ethylphosphine.              On saturating again by hydrobromic acid the liquid
thus produced, the solution now contained only the new bromide,                                          the
bromide         of   the debrominetted body, and the dibromide                               of triethyl
phosphine, the extreme solubility                       of which rendered              its   presence      al
most harmless.               The task        was thus virtually reduced              to   the separation
of   two bromides.              Unfortunately,           the two substances resemble each
other    to     such    an   extent, that this hope also had                   to   be    abandoned.
  A      modification, however,                of   this process led       to   the solution          of the
difficulty. On saturating the alkaline solution, produced  the action                        by
of oxide    silver upon the crude bromides, with hydriodic instead
                of                                                                                         of
hydrobromic             acid,   a   mixture        of   the corresponding            iodides was           ob
tained, the separation                of which could         be   easily accomplished.
   On moderately concentrating this solution,
                                                                                                           in of
                                                 beautiful iodide         a
limited solubility was deposited. This substance readily dissolved
boiling water, from which                     it    crystallized     on   cooling         in   long white
needles.         It    was less soluble         in   alcohol, insoluble         in   ether.
     The analysis             of
                      this compound, carefully purified                                        by   repeated
crystallizations, led    the following atomic expression:—
                                   to
                                                 C.H.PI.
This formula received ample confirmation                                  by   the examination              of
a   platinum- and gold-compound.                          Converted into chloride and                   pre
 cipitated        by
                dichloride   platinum, the new body furnished
                                        of                         crystal.                       a
line, difficultly-soluble platinum-salt, differing from the platinum-salts
 of   all    the other compounds this group.       of
                                              This salt dissolves                                          in
 boiling concentrated hydrochloric acid without decomposition, and
 crystallizes          on   cooling     in   beautiful yellow needles containing

                               C, H, PCl, PtCl,
    The gold-salt is      a bright yellow crystalline precipitate, difficultly
soluble in    boiling  water,  and not recrystallizable without some altera
tion.     The gold-determination      agreed with the formula
                               C, H, PCl, AuCl.
    The preceding formulae are simple translations of the analytical
results, but they convey no idea regarding the nature of the new body.
Legitimate interpretation of these expressions, and a due apprecia
tion of the conditions in which the new compounds              are formed, un
avoidably lead us to the conclusion that the formulae must be doubled.
The molecule of the new iodide thus          becomes
                                    C.s H. P.I.,
 corresponding      to an original bromide,
                                  C, H, P, Br,
 which is simply formed by the association of 2 equivalents of triethyl
 phosphine and       1  equivalent of dibromide    of ethylene,
                      20, H. P+C, H, Br,+C. H. P.Br.
  The formulae of the platinum-salt           and of the gold-salt    of course
  have likewise to be doubled:
                       Platinum-salt C. H. P. Cl, 2PtCl,
                       Gold-salt       C.s He, P.C.l., 2AuCl, ;
  the number of platinum- and gold-equivalents which respectively ex
  ist in these compounds being apparently determined by the number
   of triethylphosphine-equivalents       associated in the new salt.    I have
   vainly endeavoured to produce compounds containing only one equi
   valent of platinum and gold, but have succeeded in procuring a well
   defined silver-compound:
                                C.s H. P. Br,   AgBr,
   which is formed by treating the       new bromide    with a quantity of oxide
    of silver insufficient for complete decomposition.        This compound is
    a double salt of equal equivalents of the proximate constituents.

             compound which forms the subject of this note was the point fro

            monia on          dibromide of ethylene            ;   a   process, which, owing to the num
            ber of bodies simultaneously produced, presents considerable di<U+FB01>icu
            ties.    With the view of simplifying the reaction,                            I  have passed step

dibromide      of ethylene.             These experiments, some of which                       have
been laid already before the Royal Society, whilst others are still in
complete, have furnished many additional                           illustrations of the group
of polyammonias;             but most of these reactions are complicated, and
the compounds produced              are far from always presenting                     the salient
characters which         I   could have desired.                  In fact, it    was not     until   I
pursued     the inquiry into the phosphorus-series,                       and relying on the
promptness and precision with which these substances                              act, examined
the deportment of dibromide of ethylene with triethylphosphine, that
the experiments were attended by the desired success.
   The new diphosphonium-compounds which form the subject of
this note are remarkable for their well-de<U+FB01>ned characters, and for
their stability.        They may         be heated to 250°            C. without undergoing
the slightest change.             Even the dioxide, which is readily liberated
by the action    of oxide of silver upon either the bromide or the iodide,
is a very stable compound.                     The solution of this          substance,      which
obviously corresponds to 2 molecules of water,

is a powerfully alkaline liquid, attracting with great avidity the car
bonic acid of the atmosphere, and precipitating the metallic oxides
like potassa.   The solution may be evaporated without change to a
syrup-like liquid, and it is only at a very high temperature that
decomposition actually takes places.                         At   one time   I    had hoped to
see   this body splitting under the in<U+FB02>uence of heat into the ethylene
alcohol (glycol) and triethylphosphine,                      but the transformation ensues
in another form, only              traces          of phosphorus-base           being liberated,
while the principal product is the dioxide of triethylphosphine,                             which,
in the latter      stages     of the distillation,           coats   the neck of the retort
with   a network     of beautiful needles;               a   small quantity of gas (hydride
of ethyl   ?) being simultaneously evolved.

                                  Types in the Microscopic Structure
          the Skeleton of Osseous Fishes.”                     By A. Ktinmxa
          Professor of Anatomy and Physiology in the University
          Wiirzburg.       Communicated by Dr. SHARPEY,                     Sec.R.
          Received January 20, 1859.
      After having    been occupied for several         months with observatio
 on the minute structure of the bones of <U+FB01>shes,             I  now take the liber
 to present the results of my studies to the Royal Society.
      The principal fact which      I  have to mention is, that a great ma
 genera     of osseous <U+FB01>shes possess no bone-corpuscles,            radiated or fu
form, in their skeleton, and therefore            no   real osseaus tissue.       Th
 there exist <U+FB01>sh-bones without bone-corpuscles               must have been lo
 known in England to those who have collections of microscopic p
 parations of the hard tissues of animals, as Owen, Tomes, Williamso
 Quekett, and others;         but nobody seems to have mentioned the f
 before Williamson,       Quekett,     Dr. Mettenheimer of Frankfort, a
 myself *.       In the year    1850 Professor     Williamson pointed out t
absence      of bone-corpuscles from the bones of the God, Haddoc
Perch, Plaice, Pike, and various other <U+FB01>sh, distinguishing                   them
    *  Since this communication   was read to the Society,   Dr. Sharpey has direct
my attention to a statement      by the late Professor   J. Miiller, to the effect th
in the Pike and many other <U+FB01>sh the bones are destitute of bone-corpuscles
This statement occurs in Miiller’s Annual Report of the progress of Anatomi
and Physiological Science in 1835, and is repeated in his addition to the work
 Miescher, “ De In<U+FB02>ammatioue Ossium, eorumque Anatome Geuerali," Berl
 1836, p. 269.

this respect from the bones of the Eel, in which such corpuscles are
                                    I
abundant*; in 1853 made knownt that the bones of Leptocephalus
and Helmichthys contain no trace of bone-corpuscles; a year later,
Mettenheimer showed that the same was true of the bones of Tetra
gonurus Cuvieri: ; and in 1855 Quekett mentions, in the second
volume of the ‘Histological Catalogue of the College of Surgeons of
England, fishes belonging to eighteen genera, in the bones of which
he had not succeeded in finding bone-corpuscles—viz. Vogmarus
islandicus, Lophius piscatorius, Gadus morrhua, Ephippus, Sparus,
Trigla cuculus, Belone vulgaris,                            Pleuronectes            platessa,        Trachinus
vipera, Orthagoriscus                     mola, Exocoetus,               Scarus,          Esox,      Sphyraena
barracuda,         Tetrapturus, Zeus faber, Perca fluviatilis,                                     Gobiofluvia
tilis.      But, notwithstanding                   these       most valuable observations, little
or no progress                             in the more general treat
                         seems to have been made
ment of this matter, as is best shown by the ‘Comparative Histology’
of Leydig (1857), in which (p. 157) the Leptocephalidae, Tetrago
nurus, and Orthagoriscus are the only                             cases mentioned,                 in which the
radiated bone-corpuscles are wanting.
    On commencing              a series           of more extended investigations into the
minute        structure        of fish-bones, in October last,                           I    found that the
genera which            possess          real osseous          tissue are rather scarce, whilst,
on the other hand,               I       fell in with a great many types in which                                   the
bones contained no trace                    of    lacunae.        And         as this fact not only                  ap
peared to me of interest with regard to the development of the bones
of fishes, but also promised to                          become       of great value in systematic
zoology, and in the determination                               of fossil remains,             I   devoted my
whole time to this question.                             Now that         I    have investigated more
than 200 species belonging to nearly                              all   tribes      of   osseous fishes, and
mounted about 500 microscopic preparations                                     of   their hard structures,
I   hope      to   be   able   to       treat this question more comprehensively than
has been possible hitherto, and                            in   such    a     way        as   to   lead    to   some
general conclusions.
      In   giving the results             of    my observations,        I      begin with           an    enumera
 tion    of   the fishes which belong                     to   the one, and those which belong
 to   the other type.

the osseous            tissue without corpuscles may                        be   called, has         a   deeper

         to                                               this matter                        to
also   ;     the mean time, until my observations are more complete,
           but    in
I  must abstain from further explanation.

                                             663
     The facts exposed hitherto              have had reference only to a great
and fundamental    structural difference between two extensive groups
of osseous fishes.           I
                        may now add, that there exist also greater or
lesser    structural discrepancies amongst the different tribes                             of     each
group.    But as this is not a suitable occasion for an exposition of
the details of this question, I will only say this much:—In the higher
fishes, those with real osseous tissue, there exist differences, especially
with regard to the form and size of the bone-corpuscles;                            and          I hope
to   be able     to show that there are peculiar and tolerably well cha
racterized types     of them amongst the Ganoids, Siluroids, Salmonidae,
Cyprinoids, Clupeini, &c.               In the second group there                          are     more
varieties.       In   some tribes the bones are quite structureless                              homo
geneous masses, as in the Leptocephalidae;                          in others they have a
peculiar fibrous appearance, and consist of                         a singular       mixture            of
cartilage and osteoid structures, as Quekett first showed in the genera
Orthagoriscus         and Lophius, to which          I   may add some           Balistini; but
in the great majority of the tribes of this group, the bones contain
peculiar tubes more or less similar to those of dentine.    If these
tubes are well developed, the bones acquire a structure which can
in no way        be distinguished     from that of dentine,—a fact, which also
did not       escape the perspicacity        of Quekett, who mentions                      its   occur
rence    the genus Fistularia, the Barracuda Pike (Sphyraena bar
          in
racuda), and the Gar-fish (Belone vulgaris).      found the same      I
structure    many other genera
               in                             of
                                 this group, especially among the
Plectognathi, Pharyngognathi, Sparidae, and Squamipennes; but                                           in
the greater number this tubular structure                      is   not   so   well developed,
and    is     intermingled       with more structureless, parts.                 Another fact
deserving       of   mention with regard       to   the bones        of   this group     that    is,
there very frequently occur also structures, formed                       by   the agglomera
tion     of   calcareous globules     of   different sizes, which resemble                   in    a   re
markable degree the lower layers               of   common fish-scales.
     My   observations have also extended                to   the hard structures                of    the
skin     of   fishes, and    of   the rays   of   the    fins;   and  I    may say that                 in
general  the same laws, which apply     the structureto  the endo                of
skeleton, hold good also for the exoskeleton.   Evidence    this                       of
especially afforded          bythe fins, the rays          of
                                                      which, independently                              of is
                                                                                  in all
their hard       or   soft condition, contain bone-corpuscles               in
                                                                    the tribes
where the internal bones are provided with them, whilst                                    the other

                                                     664
case these rays are formed                    of a homogeneous osteoid substance or of
a tubular structure, which may also in some fishes, as Williamson
first showed in the Ostracionts, assume the structure of real dentine,
as    in many Plectognaths                     (Triacanthus,             Monacanthus,                 Aluteres,
Tetraodon,           and others),           and in certain Acanthopterygii                            (Equula,
Ephippus,        Haemulon,          Pristipoma, Scatophagus, Centrarchus).                                With
regard to the skin, we may at least go so far as to say that in no                                           fish
whose endoskeleton is destitute of bone-corpuscles do they exist in
the hard structures of the skin; but, on the other hand, the tribes
which      have real osseous tissue do not                      all   present     it   also     in    the skin.
Scales      or   plates with             bone-corpuscles              are    found amongst               living
Ganoids,        e.   g.   in   Polypterus,       Lepidosteus, and even Amia (in whose
scales   Müller erroneously supposed them
          J.                                     wanting), and also         to   be
inthe Acipenserini and Spatulariae; they exist also      the fossil                             in
Ganoids,         as
             the excellent observations   Williamson have shown.    of
     In   many Ganoids,                moreover,   Williamson and Quekett have
                                                          as
                                                                even portions
                                                                                                               In of
shown, the scales               often contain dentimal tubes,                     or
real dentine          (“Kosmine”               of
                                         Williamson) amidst true bone.
the scales       of   Lepidosiren, also, find bone-corpuscles, but mostly

form, and only here and there having                             a    simple stellate             figure. Of
the other fishes which have bone-corpuscles                                 in    their skeleton, little
has hitherto been noted                     to as   the coexistence              of   such corpuscles           in
their     scales,     but       find           to

true,     in   the larger scales          of   the “corselet”               of   Thynnus, also           in   the
dermal plates             of   certain Siluroids (Loricaria                  and Callichthys),                and
was pointed out                byJ.    Müller       in   the scales         of Sudis.  Leydig,                too,
states that true bone-corpuscles exist                         in   the walls         of   the grooves and
semicanals upon the scales                     of   the lateral line             in   certain Cyprinoids
(Carp, Tench, and Barbel).                       This statement

    With regard       to the members       of the     second    division,    it is  to be
observed, that probably          in all of them the          canals    attached to the
scales  of the lateral line      are formed       of true   osseous tissue;      in  those
marked with an asterisk          I  have found this by actual examination.
   The Characini        are thus divisible into two groups, according to the
nature of their scales; at the same time, these are not to be regarded
as natural divisions      in other    respects,    and the less so as one and the
same    genus, such as Leporinus,            for example, may include              species
which differ in the composition             of their      scales.     The   presence     of
corpuscles, though connected partly with the size of the scales, does
not depend solely on this, for they may be wanting in large scales

  I am       unable to find corpuscles in the scales of Lutodeira chanos,
Chatoessus punctatus and cepedianus, and Alosa vulgaris.                                 In    several
Cyprinoids (Labeo, Catastomus,                          Barbus),      I   have, in like manner,
failed to discover corpuscles in the scales proper; on the other hand,
I have found           very distinct dentinal tubes in the scales                    of Barbus, at
their hinder part.
  True osseous tissue will doubtless hereafter                            be found    in the    scales
of many other Physostomi which have it in their skeleton, but it is
not to be supposed that this will apply to all.
   In      the Physostomi, as in the Ganoids, the bone-corpuscles                                 lie   in
the lower stratum                of    the scale;       still they are situated above the
fibrous layer, and immediately                      beneath the structureless              layer,        to
which       in   all   scales   I   apply the name             of    “ganoin-layer,” inasmuch
 as
  it    has     in   all   cases the same signification.
  From the foregoing observations we are able      show still more           to
positively than could done                     by
                                 Müller, that the scales
                                    be          J.        Ganoids                       of
have       no   peculiarity       of   structure        to   distinguish    them from those              of
the Teleostei.              Nay, certain Ganoids,               as   Amia, have scales, which
in    respect even         ofpliancy, rounded contour, and the surface-marking                           of
the ganoin-layer, agree with those                      of   other fishes.
      In   reference        to   those fishes which want bone-corpuscles                     in   their
skeleton,   I     have still      to   remark,-1, that the corpuscles are also inva
 riably wanting            in   the semicanals upon the scales                of   the lateral line;
  for   what Leydig designates                 as   rudimentary           bone-corpuscles       in      the

Perch    are    in fact the tubules of the osteoid substance;                                  2, that
amongst the group of fishes in question, there are some which have
beautiful dentine in their skin-bones, e. g. Amphisile scutata and the
Ostracionts.
    To the foregoing remarks on the microscopic structure of the hard
tissues of fishes, I may add, that there also exists a third group of
fishes, in which the endoskeleton is composed only of common carti
lage, or of cartilage with depositions of earthy salts, viz. the Cyclo
stomi and Selachii.               None of         these fishes, not even the Plagiostomi
and Chimaera, possess real bone-cells in their hard parts;                                   for these
are formed only, as               J.    Müller      showed many years ago, by ossified
cartilage, that is to say, cartilage-cells                      in an ossified matrix.             Even
the hard spines         of the fins and of the skin of                      these animals are not
real bone, but dentine, as was demonstrated long since by Agassiz
and Quekett.
     If now we    sum up          all   that has been said,            we   arrive   at   the following
conclusions:
I.   There exist three types                 of   structure     in   the skeleton     of   fishes, viz.:
          1.    Type     of   the Selachii.
               The skeleton            is   formed      of   cartilage   or   ossified cartilage.
                                        Selachii, Cyclostomi.
         2.     Type     of   the Acanthopterygii.
               The skeleton            is   formed     ofa    homogeneous        or   tubular osteoid
                 substance, often              of  true dentine.
               Teleostei         (J. Müll.), with the exception                       of   the greater
                 part            the Physostomi (J. Müll.).
                         of of
          3.    Type    the Ganoidei.
               The skeleton   formed ofis                    real osseous tissue.
               Most     of   the Physostomi,                the Ganoidei, and Sirenoidei.
II.   The exoskeleton follows                     in   some    respects the same laws              as   the
     endoskeleton, and shows the following types:—
          1.    Exoskeleton formed                  of  a    homogeneous       and fibrous osteoid
                 substance.
               Scales    of   the majority             of   the Teleostei.
          2.    Exoskeleton formed                  of  dentine.
               Spines                                               Plectognathi, and             Amphi
                         in of
                                 Selachii and scales           of                            of
                 sile,           part.

     In terminating this communication,            I think it proper to mentio
  that the great liberality with which my friend Mr. Tomes of London
  and Professor Williamson of Manchester, put their large collections 
  microscopic     preparations of teeth, bones, and scales at my disposa
  proved of great assistance        in my investigations, and,     accordingly,
  am only     ful<U+FB01>lling  an agreeable     duty in now publicly expressing m
  obligations to them.       I am   also greatly indebted to my friends     Filipp
  de  Filippi of Turin and Henry Miiller of Wiirzburg, also                 to D
  Hyrtl of Vienna, and Dr. Peters of Berlin, who supplied me wit
.many of the rarer Mediterranean             and foreign <U+FB01>shes.    But, in orde
 that my observations may yield the results which may not unrea
 sonably be expected from them,            I   need more   aid; and  as   Englan
 is the country in which not only the largest zoological collections 
 <U+FB01>shes, but also       the greatest    number of microscopic preparations
 the hard tissues of recent and fossil animals, are to be found,             I tak
 the liberty     to ask the possessors        of such collections who may         b
 interested in this matter to favour me with such specimens                 as ma
 seem to them calculated to give to this series              of observations th
 greatest    possible extension.
 III.   “ On    the Physical Phenomena of            Glaciers.”--Part     II.    B
        Dr. TYNDALL, F.R.S.              Received    February 24, 1859.
                                      [Abstract]
    The main portion of this Paper deals with the veinecl structure o
glacier ice. The author refers to his observations in the Mer-dc-glace
in 185 7, and his reasons for withholding         them, and visiting the glacier
once more in 1858.
    He   describes   the general aspect of the structure, and examines th
two theories of the phenomenon which are now deserving of attention
one   of  these considers the blue veins to be a continuation        of the bed

                                       669
ding of the Névé, the other regards them              as being produced by
pressure.
    ‘Wishing to confer upon the inquiry the character of an experi
mental one, his desire      in 1858     was to examine a great number         of
glaciers,    which    should exhibit    the ice under different mechanical
conditions,    thus accepting the combinations made          by nature as      a
substitute for those, which, under ordinary circumstances, are made by
the experimentalist himself.         He therefore <U+FB01>rst visited and examined
the glaciers of Grindelwald.          Crossing the Strahleck, he descended
the glacier of.the Aar to the Grimsel, and proceeded thence to the
glacier    of the Rhone.       He subsequently spent eight days in the
neighbourhood       of the great Aletsch- glacier, and afterwards eleven
days exploring       the range of glaciers which stretches from Monte
 Rosa to the Mont Cervin.         From Zermatt    he proceeded to Saas, and
 spent <U+FB01>ve days in the vicinity of the Allalein glacier       :  he afterwards
 visited   the Fée glacier, and completed his expedition by           a visit to
 the Mer-de-glace and its tributaries, and a second expedition to the
 summit of Mont Blanc.
     The Paper contains     an account    of the observations made upon all
 these glaciers, and these observations go unitedly to prove that the
 production     of the structure   is independent  of the strati<U+FB01>cation of the
 Névé, and is the result of intense pressure acting upon the glaciers.
 The author points out the place at which the structure is manufac
 tured, and whence it is sent forward, giving a character to other
 portions of the glacier which have no share in its formation.
     The observations include        some  which leave no doubt as to the
 general independence of structure and strati<U+FB01>cation.           On the Furgge
  glacier, for example, <U+FB01>ne ice sections       are exposed,   which   show the
  bedding in   a  perfectly distinct and beautiful manner     ;  while crossing
  the beds at   a  high angle, we have the true veined structure.            The
  coexistence of both is exactly analogous to that of cleavage and bed
  ding in slate rocks.       While however the independence of both is
  thus proved, it is not asserted that the direction of structure and
  strati<U+FB01>cation never coincide.        As the cleavage of rocks is sometimes
  parallel to the bedding, so may the strata of glaciers coincide with
  the structure; and this is probably the case in many of the so-called
  secondary glaciers of the Alps.

    The author divides the questions of structure into          three  princip
                                    '
 cases  :—
    lst. Marginal Structure, produced by pressure            due to the swif
 motion of the centre of the glacier.
    2nd. Longitudinal         Structure, produced by pressure consequ
 on the mutual thrust of two tributary glaciers; developing vei
 which run parallel to the direction of the trunk stream.
    3rd. Transverse        Structure,    produced     by pressure due to t
 change of inclination,—and           the thrust    from  behind, endured
 glaciers at the bases of the ice-falls.
    The author      also gives a physical      analysis of the mode in whi
 the pressure produces the structure.            He shows experimentally th
 planes of liquefaction are produced in ice at right angles to the dire
 tion of a pressure acting upon the mass.           In the glacier  these plan
 of liquefaction   are the channels by which the air is ejected, and t
 blue veins produced.
    A  section  of the Paper is devoted to the consideration of the sha
 of the bubbles entangled in glacier ice ; as a<U+FB01>brding evidence
 pressure.     The author has endeavoured to refer the observed fac
 to their true cause, and to show that the conclusions hitherto dra
 from this remarkable phenomenon are untenable.               The  shape  of t
 bubbles    furnishes     no   ground    for  any   conclusion   regarding   t
pressure to which the mass containing them has been subjected.
    The Paper     also    includes a short section containing remarks 
glacier motion ;      in which it is shown that this motion is of        a co
posite character;      being partly due to the sliding of the glacier ov
its bed, and partly to the yielding          of the ice under  severe pressur
A brief section is     also devoted to the explanation       of the Dirt-band
                           '
of the Mer-de-glace.

was     at   that time especially directed                         to   the compound formed                        by   the
union     of       tin with ethyl, and                 to   which the name stamethyl was given.
The iodide               of   stamethyl was prepared                    by   exposing iodide             of   ethyl      to
light     or
        heat              in    the presence          of    tinfoil; and,          by   acting with zinc upon
the aqueous solution                     of   this iodide         of   stamethyl        or   of   the chloride           of

  Although there could                      be   little doubt of the formation of stannic
ethide by heating stamethyl to 150°C., yet the author could not                                               suc
ceed in obtaining               the former body in a state                           of purity from this
source: it          seemed probable, however, that stannic ethiodide would
be easily converted into stannic ethide by bringing it into contact
with zincethyl; and a preliminary experiment completely realized
this expectation.              The results of this reaction, together with                               its   ex
tension       to   other analogous organo-metallic                         compounds, form the                sub
ject    of   the present Memoir.
              I.      Action       of   Zincethyl upon Iodide                    of   Stanethyl.
      About two ounces               of   crystals     of    iodide    of    stanethyl were gradually
added        to     strong solution             of   zincethyl        in   ether, care being taken              to
preserve  an a       excess     of   zincethyl.           On submitting the resulting syrupy
liquid       to    distillation,    it    began        to   boil      at   70°    C.; but       the thermo
meter        rapidly rose           to    180° C., between which                           temperature        and
200°C. the greater part                     of   the product passed over, solid iodide                          of
zinc containing   little zincethyl being left
                           a                    the retort. The di              in
stillate was washed with dilute acetic  acid, and the dense ethereal
liquid which separated was dried over chloride                                    of      calcium, and    recti
                                                  of
fied.     The greater portion                     it       distilled       at   181°, and was collected
apart.        Submitted            to    analysis,        it    yielded         results      leading     to    the

oxide     of      stamethyl,       and      a    slightly metallic, though not unpleasant
taste.        Its specific gravity              is   1.187      at   23°C.       A   determination       of    the
specific gravity           of   its     vapour gave the number 8,021, showing that
stannic ethide consists                 of   one volume          of   thin vapour and four volumes
of    ethyl, the five volumes being condensed                                to   two.       Stannic ethide
boils    at   181°C., and distils unchanged, thus differing from                                       stamnous
ethide,       which       decomposes              at   150°, chiefly into                   metallic tin and

stannic ethide, a reaction calling to mind the behaviour of stamnous
oxide when boiled with a caustic alkali.    Stannic ethide is inflam
mable, burning with a lurid flame fringed with deep blue and                                                                 evol
ving white fumes of stannic oxide. In oxygen it burns much more
brilliantly, with a white light fringed with blue.
        It   was important                 to ascertain the deportment                                of stannic ethide
with negative elements, since,                              if it were       found to be capable                    of direct
combination,                   its   analogy      to   inorganic            stannic compounds would be,
             great extent, disproved.                       Like zincethyl, however, stannic ethide
is to
    a
    incapable              of   combining with any other element without the                                             expul

iodine, the latter dissolves with  deep brown colour, which, how a
ever, gradually disappears;                              and      if   the addition               of    iodine          be   con

liquid,           on    being submitted                to   distillation,        is   found       to   consist      of   iodide

five ounces of chloride of mercurous  ethyl  (Hg  (C, H.) Cl) were

    The experiments detailed in the foregoing pages requiring the
of considerable quantities of zincmethyl, the author’s attention
directed to the preparation of this body in much larger quant
than could be obtained by the operations in sealed glass tubes
viously described by him. He found that the preparation of a st
 ethereal solution of zincmethyl     succeeded   most satisfactorily
copper digester, heated to 100°      C.;  in fact, the decomposition
zinc of an ethereal solution of iodide of methyl is much more qui
and perfectly effected     than that of a similar    solution of iodid
ethyl   ;  but on submitting   the product to recti<U+FB01>cation, a liquid
obtained boiling     at about 51° C., spontaneously in<U+FB02>ammable to
last degree,    and possessing the intolerable      odour of zincmet
On analysis, however, it yielded numbers closely agreeing with
 formula
                        2(3:%:} ZI»)+3: 32      l °2
The speci<U+FB01>c gravity of its vapour was 3*l2l5, a number which 
 not correspond with the theoretical speci<U+FB01>c gravity of a compou
 the above formula, unless the exceedingly improbable assumptio
 adopted, that it contains two volumes of zincmethyl vapour, un
 with    one volume   of ether vapour, without condensation. On
 other hand, it accords closely with the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the va
 of  a mixture  of zincmethyl and ether in the    above proportions.
     Without   at present otfering any decided opinion as to the na
 of this body, the author states that in repeated operations with l
 quantities of materials he has entirely failed in obtaining pure 
 methyl by this method of proceeding.
     Similar  repeated   attempts to produce pure zincethyl      from
 and iodide of methyl, without      the intervention of ether, were
 unsuccessful, although this method generally succeeds in small 
 tubes.     This anomaly in the results obtained from the      same m
 rials heated in a copper digester and in glass tubes, is doubtless
 to the di<U+FB01>‘erence of the conditions in the two cases.      In a glass
 half immersed in      a heated oil bath, a constant distillation    of
 internal liquid is going on, the liquid condensed in the upper
  tion of the tube <U+FB02>owing over an extensive surface of zinc i

of the    vessel,      owing to the high conductivity of the metal, are main
tained at so uniform a temperature as to prevent any such circulation
of the liquid from taking place.
   The body just described being regarded as a mere mixture of zinc
methyl and ether, incapable of being separated on account of the
close proximity of their boiling points, a more successful result was
anticipated         by mixing the iodide of methyl with methylic ether                                       in
stead                 As methylic ether boils at -21°C., it was
          of vinic ether.
thought that no such difficulty of separation could arise; the bodies
employed would then, in fact, be exactly homologous with those so
successfully used in the preparation of pure zincethyl on the large
scale.  It was found, however, that although a large quantity of
zincmethyl was produced, yet it was impossible to obtain it free from
methylic ether.                  A      large portion of the product                  boiled at 43°, a

Royal Society       the_  following brief remarks on the quotation from
Luc’s “Idées sur la Météorologie,” which has been referred to
fresh evidence in the controversy as to the discovery of the Com
sition of Water.
    It is only at <U+FB01>rst sight, and when taken in an isolated form ap
from the rest of De Luc’s narrative,              that the passage in questi
 could bear the interpretation           now sought to be put upon            it;
 Dr. Priestley’s communication of Cavendish’s experiment is s
by De Luc to have been made “vers la <U+FB01>n de l’année l782.”
 in the same section of the same volume he distinctly and positiv
 says,   that when in September [1783] he returned to Birmingha
 “Nous ignorions, M. Watt et moi, que M. Cavendish cut eu
 idées fort semblables aux siennes sur la Cause de ce Phénomene
    Now,    we may well ask, how could this possibly have been the c
 with De Luc in         1783,   if Priestley’s   communication to him in 1
 had extended to the conclusions,            as well as to the experiments,

    De Luc adds, on the next page of his work, that                    “Au    mois

 Here, for the <U+FB01>rst time in De Luc’s narrative (with the exceptio
 an allusion to Blagden’s statement at Paris in June 1783), occu
 clear and distinct notice           of Cavendish’s theory or        conclusions,
 distinguished from his experiments.              What M. De Luc’s opinion

 he perused      it in March     1784, and sent an analysis      of it  to  Mr. W

    We    are thus enabled       to set against the interpretation attempte
 be  put on the quotation from the “Météorologie,” the most 
 clusive of all testimony; that, namely, of De Luc himself: fo
 he had intended to say that in the end              of   1782 the conclusion
 Cavendish      had along with his experiment been               communicated
 Priestley, he could not possibly have gone on to say, as he has d
  a few pages      later in the same volume, that in September 1783
  was ignorant of Cavendish having entertained any such ideas;

II.   “New Volatile Organic Acids, from                    the   Berry of the
        Mountain     Ash.”       By A. W. Hormarm,              LL.D., F.R.S.
        Received February 3, 1859.
    Whoever has been engaged          in the preparation of malic acid from
the juice of the unripe berries of the Mountain Ash (Sorbua Aucu
paria), cannot     have   failed to perceive the peculiar powerful odour
evolved during the evaporation of the liquid partially saturated with
lime.     The body to which          this  odour  belongs was      hitherto  un
known,      and only lately, my friend and former pupil,            Dr. George
Merck of Darmstadt, when preparing malic acid on a large scale,
conceived the happy idea of evaporating the liquid in a distilling
apparatus.       He thus obtained an acid distillate, from which he suc
ceeded    in separating an oily body possessed of acid properties.           To
the kindness of Dr. Merck          I am indebted for an appreciable quan
tity of this remarkable body, which has enabled              me to examine its
properties and establish its composition.
    The preparation of the oil from the           aqueous     acid obtained by
distilling the mother liquor of the bimalate of calcium, presents no
dif<U+FB01>culty. The liquid is saturated with soda, evaporated and mixed
with dilute sulphuric acid, when the oil rises as a brown layer to the
surface of the liquid.       It is separated by ether, and after the volati
lization of the latter, submitted to distillation.           The <U+FB01>rst portions
of the distillate contain appreciable quantities of water; the thermo
meter, however, rapidly rises above 200° C. What now distils is a
perfectly pure compound, which,            on redistillation,   exhibits a con

but    it   soon acquires            a      yellowish             tint.            It   has    a    peculiar         aromatic
odour, not disagreeable when dilute, but rather offensive when                                                                con
centrated.          The specific gravity                         is   1:0681.            It    is   somewhat soluble
in    water, very soluble                  in    alcohol and ether; these solutions are                                        di
stinctly acid.             The       oil    dissolves            in   potassa and ammonia, also                           in   the
carbonated alkalis, without, however, expelling their carbonic acid.
Mineral acids separate                         again from these compounds.

        BowdLER BUCKToN, Esq., F.R.S., F.L.S., F.C.S. Received
        March 3, 1859.
                                            (Abstract.)
    On resuming my inquiries into the nature of these organo-metals,
I   have met with some interesting reactions, which I here wish briefly
to notice.
     The preparation of mercuric, stannic, and plumbic ethyls, through
the action of zinc ethyl on various organic and inorganic                                   salts, has
been already detailed in my sketch published                           in the ‘Proceedings of
the Royal Society";               but at that time,            I was not        able to fix, with
certainty, the constitution             of the compounds which were produced
by acids on the different radicals.                  An appeal to analysis now en
ables me to state the following
                           Mercuric ethyl.
  The reactions of this liquid are well-marked. Towards sulphuric
and hydrochloric acids it follows the deportment of   homologue                      its
mercuric methyl.            When assisted            by   gentle heat, one equivalent                     of
ethyl   is   disengaged, which unites with the hydrogen                          of   the acid, and
forms hydride          ofethyl, whilst the acid takes                  its   place, and gives rise
to   the corresponding salt            of   mercurous ethyl.
   The radical bursts into flame when poured into chlorine gas, and
isalmost entirely destroyed; but when      slowly mixed under water
                                                          it  is
with iodine     bromine, the disengagement
                  or                           ethyl gas   scarcely   of                   is
perceived, and iodide             or   bromide       of   ethyl may             be    recovered           by
distillation.

        group should, in correctness,       be doubled.       I  have   not, however,
        been able to satisfy these      views by direct experiment.              Zincet
        acts readily on salts of mercurous methyl;                and in all probabi
        gives a body compounded of ethyl and methyl with a double e
        valent of mercury

                                              .     The   substance,     however,   if  p
        duced, is obviously broken by distillation into the two radicals m
        curic ethyl and mercuric methyl.             Experiment      may perhaps pr
        more successful  if salts of   stannic methyl      be   similarly treated.
           The electro-negative character of the group Cu;             H,,2+, in the cl
        of organo-metals to which zincethyl belongs, may now perhaps
        considered as established.        Some     interest, nevertheless,    attaches
       the question whether sodium is capable of displacing ethyl from m
       curic ethyl.    An answer to this question would give              us some me
       of judging the position of ethyl,        as regards its eleetro-negative       fu
       tion towards the true metals.
           At ordinary temperatures, sodium           has only a slow action on m
       curic ethyl, but after the lapse of a few hours               a  voluminous g
       sponge is formed, whilst the      liquid entirely disappears. This spon
       like body has the property of spontaneous combustibility in a mark
       degree, and is liable to explosion from apparently very slight caus
       By the application of     a gentle heat, a strong rush          of gaseous mat
      is evolved    which eudiometric        experiments proved to be a mixtu
      of ethylene and hydride of ethyl, obviously proceeding from the d
      integration of a double molecule of ethyl.
          From this experiment     we should conclude that           ethyl, methyl, &
      in these radicals are still negative to mercury, and therefore, that m
      cury, copper, &e. would not, as Mr. Wanklyn supposes,                       displa

mule of the       salts   of stanethyl,        has originated, without doubt, from
the mode adopted by Liiwig in                     their    elimination.       Strecker        has
lately shown that many of these compounds may, with probability,
be referred to the types         of the inorganic oxyiodides              and oxychlorides
of tin.
  The following           experiments were undertaken with the impression
that the pure salts of stanethyl might be more advantageously pro
cured by acting directly on the radical itself.
  Stannic diethyl, Sn (C,          H,),, like mercuric ethyl,               loses one       of its
equivalents of ethyl when digested with concentrated acids.                                  The
action, however, is very slow with hydrochloric                          acid, an oily body
being <U+FB01>rst formed, possessed              of   an exceedingly pungent          odour; but

                                     Sn C,        H, Cl.
     This salt produces <U+FB01>ne, hard crystals, which                    are soluble in water,
and, when pure,           almost inodorous.           A    more ready method of ob
taining this chloride consists in adding the radical, drop by drop, to
a layer of bromine covered with water, until the bromine is decolor
ized; the aqueous solution is then decomposed by potash, which pre
cipitates oxide of stanethyl in the form of a white powder, from
                                                                                        '
which the pure salts of stanethyl may be readily procured.
  The solubility of these salts in aqueous potash has been rather
variously stated by Lowig and Fraukland,                      and also their characters
as odorous       and inodorous.           The truth         is,   that unless the salts of
stanethyl       are formed from          the oxide, they are almost always con
taminated with the above-mentioned oily chloride, the oxide of which
is   soluble    in potash.       As oxide of stanetbyl              is   not affected by       al
kaline      solutions, these two bodies             may be separated          without        di<U+FB02>i
culty.
  The soluble oxide may            be recovered from the alkaline solutions                       by
distillation.      It   passes   over,    together with aqueous vapour, in the
form      of an exceedingly caustic and pungent oil, which blues litmus,
and has all the characters of            a   powerful base.          Water dissolves         it   in
moderate quantities, but precipitates               it    again on the addition of com
mon salt.        When deprived of water, the oily                    base solidi<U+FB01>es into          a
crystalline mass.
     This oxyde forms de<U+FB01>nite             salts   with     acids, all more or less pun
gent.     With hydrochloric        and hydriodic acids, uncrystallizable bodies,

                                      688
    insoluble in water, are produced, but with sulphuric           acid it for
    <U+FB01>ne, colourless crystals, which by analysis gave the formula
                       st, 0,, 11,, so, or sn, (0,   H5), so,
        For this compound    I  propose the name of sulphate of distan
    triethyl.   It has, in a remarkable      degree,   the unusual property
    being more soluble in cold than in hot water.              A  cold satura
    solution becomes    semi-solid by raising     the temperature somew
    below ebullition.
        A consideration of the elements      of the   above   formula furnish
    an idea of these bodies being either double salts, compounded
    one equivalent    of stannic diethyl with one equivalent of any s
    Sn C4 H, X, or else a combination of three equivalents of stannic
    ethyl, with one equivalent of an inorganic salt Sn X2, resulting in t
    molecules of the sesqui-ethylated salt. Thus
                   3 Sn  (0, H,),+ Sn c1,=2 sn, (0, H,), Cl.
       Experiment proves that the former bodies mix, but do not comb
    chemically, at any moderate heat.         The latter  bodies,  on the ot
   hand, exhibit strong chemical action, and disengage great heat duri
    combination.
       Bichloride of tin forms   an  oily body with stannic diethyl, chie
   composed of chloride of distannic triethyl,        which by treatment w
   potash     may be made      to furnish   the corresponding      salts witho
   di<U+FB01>iculty.
       Iodide of distannic triethyl may often be found amongst the p
   ducts of the action of tin on iodide of ethyl.          It  is very probab
   identical with the oil noticed by Riche and Cahours, and describ
   by them as possessing the pungent odour of oil of mustard.
    _~
       These salts also must be considered to be identical with tho
   described by Liiwig under         the somewhat inappropriate         name
   “ methylo-stanethyls.”       The present    name is suggested      as more
   accordance with their true constitution.          They <U+FB01>nally    pass, by t
   action of zincethyl, into the radical stannic diethyl.
       The            of iodide of distannic triethyl amongst the stan
Ir
            presence
   bodies in L6wig’s experiments can be satisfactorily accounted for,
    nresuming the incomplete reduction of the iodides by the alloy
    ‘in and sodium, employed in the reactions.
       The behaviour of zincethyl towards the chlorides of tin may

                                               689
expressed, step by step, by the following equations, the tin-salt being
supposed to be added to the zincethyl:—
              I.    2Zn C, H, + SnCl2=Sn (C, H.),        +2Zn Cl
             II.    37m C, H, 4-2Sn Cl, =Sn, (C, H.), Cl-H3Zn Cl
            III.                     C, H, Cl-H ZnCl; also
                     Zn C, H, + SnCl,+Sn
            IV. 2Zn C, H,+ SnCl =Sn C, H,+Zn C, H, +ZnCl.
                                                          Double compound?
  I have failed         in satisfactorily separating the radical stannic ethyl
from the    excess      of zincethyl,       as represented          in the last reaction.            By
the addition of water great heat is generated, and tin is thrown down
in its metallic state.
   By distillation also, the radical stannic ethyl is similarly broken up,
                              2Sn C,   H, =Sn (C, H.), +Sn.
                                       Plumbic diethyl.
   In   the abstract above alluded                  to,    I   have stated the difficulties
which at that time prevented my obtaining the lead radical in a state
of purity. This difficulty arises from         tendency        its
                                                            decompose               to
suddenly     at
             a point below that    ebullition. of This disadvantage                                   is
entirely obviated         by   conducting the distillation               in   vacuo,      or   at   least
under reduced atmospheric pressure.                         The organo-metal was found
 todistil unchanged under    pressure                   mercury

      Analysis gave numbers leading                 to   the formula—
                                Pb   C,   H,   or   Pb    (C, H.),
   Plumbic diethyl       limpid and colourless fluid, possessing

      The only salts hitherto prepared from this radical                           seemed formed
 on    the type    of
                  the sesquioxides.  By passing excess                             of   hydrochloric
 acid gas over the organo-metal, hydride                         of   ethyl    is   liberated, and
 chloride    of    diplumbic triethyl        is   obtained.
              2Pb (C,         H.),+H Cl=Pb, (C. H.), Cl4-C.                        H.

 The chloride        is   a   fine crystalline       body, occurring           in       long needles,

which fuse at a gentle heat, and then take fire, with the character
istic lead flame.
    Oxide of diplumbic triethyl may    be obtained by heating any     of the
corresponding salts with strong potash, or by acting on a solution of
the chloride with oxide     of silver.   It   is a crystalline body, which
fuses into an oil-like liquid, at a gentle heat.
    Sulphuric acid forms an abundant crop of asbestos-like needles
when mixed with a warm solution of the chloride of diplumbic tri
ethyl.    It  may also be obtained by neutralizing        a solution  of the
oxide, and also by the action    of sulphate of silver on the chloride.
    Analysis furnished numbers which pointed to the formula
                   Pb, C, H, SO,    or Pb, (C, H.),    SO.
All   the salts of this sesqui-ethylated      base  are volatile, and their
vapours attack the eyes and mucous membrane of the throat.                In
this respect they imitate their homologues in the stannic series.
    In  concluding  this short abstract,    I  will only express my belief
that a wide field of research is still open for inquiry, and that some
promising experiments are at present in hand, from the right under
standing of which we may hope to throw additional             light on these
interesting substances.
IV. “On      Muscular    Action from an electrical point of view.”
       By CHARLEs BLAND RADcLIFFE, M.D., F.R.C.P., Physician
       to  the Westminster       Hospital,      &c.    Communicated       by
       JAMEs PAGET, Esq.         Received February 6, 1859.
    This Paper was read in part.
                            March 17, 1859.
Sir BENJAMIN          C.  BRODIE, Bart., President, in the Chair.
    The reading of Dr. RADCLIFFE's Paper, “On Muscular Action
from an electrical point of view,” was resumed and concluded.
                                (Abstract.)
    The author begins by observing, that the signs      of electrical action
in living muscle die out pari passu with the signs of irritability;
and, as with these latter      signs, their last trace has disappeared
 before the occurrence   of rigor mortis.

                                                                    691
   It   would appear, also, (in so far as electrical action is concerned)
that there is a close agreement between ordinary muscular contrac
tion and rigor mortis, for in ordinary muscular contraction, as Prof.
Du Bois Reymond has so well shown, there is a partial disappearance
of electrical           action.         Professor Matteucci, however, is doubtful as to
this, and he maintains, on the contrary, that at this time the                                                             “mus
cular current” is sometimes                                    reversed,        and sometimes increased in
intensity without being reversed.
   In his         recent experiments Prof. Matteucci uses a galvanometer                                                              of
which the ends are so arranged as to get rid      of the disturbing
influences of secondary polarity.     Instead of being of platinum
immersed in a saturated solution of common salt, as in Prof. Du Bois
Reymond's arrangement,                   of amalgamated zinc im
                                                    these           ends   are
mersed in saturated solution of neutral sulphate of zinc. This
arrangement, originally proposed by Dr. Jules Regnault, the author
agreeswith Prof. Matteucci in regarding as a great improvement
upon that used by Prof. Du Bois Reymond; for, says he, “not
only is the disturbing                         influence of secondary polarity                                    got rid            of,
but the entrance                  of    currents into the coil                            of   the galvanometer                       is
greatly facilitated.                   Of      this   I            am satisfied after many comparative
                                                                                -
trials *.”
   In    the experiment                 in      which Prof. Matteucci finds what                                           he   con
siders       to   be   the proof          of    the reversal               of   the muscular current during
contraction,            he     takes   a   prepared frog's thigh with                              a     long portion                 of
nerve attached, and watches the changes                                                  of   the muscular                 current

  contraction.      There is, it is true, no secondary polarity in the ga
  nometer to drive the needle back, as in the case where platin
  electrodes are used     ; but there may be a tendency to oscillate b
 wards, and the question is whether the mere movement of oscilla
 may not be su<U+FB01>icient to account for the phenomena.                   What 
 be done, then, is to compare the rate             at which the needle m
 backward during contraction with the rate at which the needle 
 backward in simple oscillation;        and when this is done, the author <U+FB01>
 that the needle moves backward more slowly during contraction tha
 does when    it is simply left to oscillate in the  same direction.   It is fou
 indeed, that there is no reverse          current during contraction, fo
 there were, the impulse of this current would be added to the imp
 of oscillation, and (as is the      case where the platinum ends are us
the needle       would    go backwards more quickly during contrac
than it does when left to fall backwards from the same point un
the in<U+FB02>uence        of simple oscillation.      There is also another wa
showing the non-existence of a reverse current during muscular c
traction,    namely, by modifying         the experiment in the way wh
Prof. Du Bois Reymond employs to get rid of the secondary pola
of the platinum ends. The only difference between the experim
as modi<U+FB01>ed and the original experiment is            this—that the wire of
of the electrodes is broken, and the broken               ends are connected
being dipped into a small cup of mercury.               An arrangement is t
made by     which the circuit may        be easily broken and closed: ag
In performing the modi<U+FB01>ed experiment, the                degree and direction
the current of the relaxed muscle is <U+FB01>rst observed.                Then the
cuit is broken        by  removing the end of the divided electrode
of the cup of mercury, and the           needle   is allowed to return to z
In   the next place, the muscle is tetanized, and while in this state
is included in the circuit of the galvanometer by replacing the 

                                            693
of the divided electrode in the mercury.                    The result         is simply this,
that the needle        moves     in the same direction                as that       in which        it
moved     under     the current of the relaxed muscle, but not to the
same distance from zero.             In other words, the muscular current is
weakened but not changed in direction when the muscle passes into
the state   of contraction.
    In the experiment in which Prof. Matteucci                       sees an intensi<U+FB01>cation
of the muscular current during contraction without any change in
direction, he takes a prepared frog, and after preservinga su<U+FB02>iciently
long portion of the sciatic nerve, he amputates the thigh above the
middle    joint.     Then, taking          the lower        portion of the amputated
thigh with the        nerve     attached to         it,   and placing the cut surface
against: an electrode of the galvanometer and                            the uncut surface
against the other electrode, he watches the needle                             as   it   diverges
under the current of the relaxed muscle. After this, he brings about
a   state of contraction      in the muscle, by irritating the nerve with a
feeble interrupted current, and, looking at the needle, he see;                           it   move
in the same direction as that in which                it    had already moved              under
the current        of the relaxed         muscle.         That      is   to say,     the needle
shows, not weakening or change of direction, but actual intensi<U+FB01>ca
tion.  On repeating this experiment, the author <U+FB01>nds that                                      it   is
most di<U+FB02>icult to draw any safe conclusion from it; for in a thigh
prepared in this manner          it   is   almost impossible to keep                  the same
point of the cut transverse surface in steady opposition to the elec
trode.   Indeed, the necessary e<U+FB02>'ect of contraction   to draw away       is
the cut end from the electrode, and in this way to interrupt                                    the
entrance of the current of the contracted muscle into the circuit of
the galvanometer.        The     effect    of contraction, moreover,                is   often to
bring upon the electrode portions of muscle which have not entered
into the state of contraction, and in this way the only current which
<U+FB01>nds admission into the galvanometer may be that which         derived               is
from relaxed muscle.          This   is   often the case, and hence the apparent
intensi<U+FB01>cation of the muscular current during contraction, which                                    is
now and then witnessed in this experiment (it      not always wit        is
nessed), may, after all, be due to the irruption of additional quantities
of the current of the relaxed muscle into the galvanometer. At any
rate, the experiment       is   one from which            it   is   most di<U+FB02>icult to draw
any certain conclusions.

there is every reason to believe that the result is altogether different.
In this        case,    it appears              as   if the     secondary or induced                       current must
involve, not the intensification, but the discharge of the muscular
current in all the muscle which enters into the circuit of the second
ary current.                For what is the peculiarity of the secondary current?
It   is     a current            of momentary duration, disappearing almost in the
very instant             of        its    appearing, and carrying along with                                it     in   its   dis
charge any electricity                      it   may meet with               in    its   circuit.           Hence there

current, whether natural                        or   artificial,     is    to    antagonize contraction;
and that this            is   really the case may                 be      argued finally from the fact
(recently            discovered          by    Dr. Eckhard) that the state                                    of   tetanus
is      put     an   end      to    by   the passage            of   a     constant galvanic                       current
through the tetanized parts.
        “Nor    is    there any reason               to   suppose that the contraction                             is      pro

here the muscular current has died out slowly, and the contraction
has not supervened until the last traces have disappeared.                                                       In    ordi
nary contraction,               it   might         be
                                             supposed that there had been some
transmutation              of   the muscular current into contractile force, that                                  or
                                                                                           some vital property
of an
        electric discharge had served                      asa    stimulus          to
        contractility.             But this idea           is   contradicted   (this among other
ways)          by   the recent investigations                   of    Dr. Harley upon the modus
operandi         of   strychnia.           These investigations prove conclusively that
this poison acts              by    making the bloodless able                     to      appropriate oxygen,
and       by   impairing           the irritability        of   the muscles.                    They prove, that
                                                                                                by by
is      to    say, that strychnia               produces          contraction,                           reducing           the
amount          of    stimulus supplied                 in   the blood, and                             rendering          the
muscles less capable                      of   responding            to   any stimulus.                  I     find also
that strychnia              exercises          a   directly       depressing influence upon                                the
nervous and muscular currents.                            I     place the two hind limbs                            of     the
same frog, properly prepared, one                               in a      weak solution                  of   strychnia,
the other           in   plain water, and, leaving them                      to   themselves,            I     find that
the nerve and muscular currents have died out much sooner                                                          in      the
limb which has                  been acted upon
                                                                by
                                                                 the strychnia.                          Now,              this
case, the limbs have been left                          to   themselves, and                 it         cannot     be in   said
therefore that the nerve and muscular currents have been changed
into contractile force                     by   any kind             of    correlative              transmutation.
Indeed, the facts would only seem                               to    be   intelligible                 on   the suppo
sition that, electrically considered, the strychnia has brought about
contraction according       the mode which has been set forth
                                          to                      the                                               in
preceding pages.                    Nor    on   this view       is   the fact less intelligible, that

                                                   697
the respiration of muscle is carried on more energetically in muscles
which are made to contract than in muscles which are allowed to
rest.     Prof. Matteucci,               who has recently ratified this fact by some
very    elaborate investigations,                  holds       that the chemical actions of
muscular       respiration are transformed into electricity,                                  and the elec
trical into contractile force; but there is just                                  as good reason                for
supposing       that the increased chemical action may be required to
keep up the muscular current, which current is being continually
annihilated       by the actions which bring about contraction.                                            And
thus, after all, the increased respiration                            of muscles which            are made
to contract, may refer, not to the contraction, but to the renewal of
the state of relaxation.                 At   any rate,        it is scarcely possible to refer
to this fact      as an objection to the view                          which is         set   forth in this
paper.
     “Regarded in         an electrical point               of view then, there appears to be
good reason         for concluding that the history of muscular action is in
harmony with the theory which                           I   have endeavoured to set forth at
various      times, and more recently in the second edition                                      of   a    work

action    of   certain agents—electricity,                     nervous influence, and others,
which had previously kept the muscle                                   in   a   state   of    relaxation         or

The reaction, accordingly, might be represented                                    thus:
                  C.                               C,2 O.

and would consist in the replacementof C, H, by C, O.
   On inspection of Dr. Geuther's paper it appeared that the above
reaction was not established with sufficient certainty.                      The presence
of C, H,      as a gaseous        product was          not satisfactorily proved by direct
experiment, but inferred from the production                                of formiate of soda.
  Berthelot has shown that carbonic oxide is capable of uniting
with the hydrated alkalies, so as to form alkaline formiates. Also,
it is extremely difficult, and perhaps impossible, to obtain sodium
alcohol free from hydrate                  of soda.           It    seemed,         therefore, not           un
reasonable to suspect that Dr. Geuther's formiate came from hydrate
of soda accompanying the sodium-alcohol                                employed in his                experi
ments.        The investigation about to be described shows that such was
really the case.
     Sodium-alcohol,          freshly      prepared         from sodium                  and anhydrous
alcohol, was introduced                  into    small glass bulbs, and hermetically
sealed       therein.        One of the bulbs, containing                               406 gramme            of
crystallized        sodium-alcohol,             was placed           in     a      flask of 155 cubic
centimetres’         capacity.          The      neck       of the flask was contracted
before the blowpipe.                   Carbonic       oxide, after slow passage through
potash solution, and then through sulphuric acid, was next made to
fill the flask by displacement.                   Finally, the contracted neck of the
flask was closed by fusion, and thus the bulb containing                                           sodium
alcohol was inclosed in an atmosphere of pure oxide of carbon.                                         By
agitation the inclosed bulb was broken, and
                                                                          in its contents came freely
in contact with the carbonic oxide contained                                    the flask. Particular
attention was paid during this stage                          of    the process, and the fused
sodium-alcohol was seen flowing over the inner surface                                     of    the flask.
     After    a   digestion       in   the water-bath              lasting         for more than four
hours, the flask was opened under mercury, when                                      a  slight contrac
tion was observed            in   the volume       of   its   gaseous           contents.         This con
traction, amounting            to   about one-fifth           of   the entire contents, was due
        doubt partly                                                               by

        soda, and   partly     to   the difference between the temperature                              at   the

                                               699
time  of sealing before the blowpipe, and that at the time of opening
under mercury.
   The following are the particulars of an examination of the gas
contained in the flask after the four hours                      digestion at 100°                C.
   In order to remove any alcohol vapour, the gas was agitated with
about one-fifth of its volume of boiled distilled water, when it under
went very little diminution in volume—a                       circumstance, which shows
that no volatile liquid capable of absorption by water had                                 been      gene
rated during the reaction.
   Some    of the washed gas was then treated with                           a potash bullet and
with pyrogallic acid, in order to remove any traces of carbonic acid
and oxygen. The amount of these gases present was very trifling, as
the readings     show:—

          1000 millims'. pressure)               . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     65.091

   After this treatment          a portion        of the      gas was          transferred to the

     Comparison     of the analysis with these numbers will show that the
 gas was pure oxide of carbon.                Furthermore,     if we assume that the
 trifling departure from the theoretical quantities for pure oxide of
 carbon was due to the presence                of olefiant gas, and       if we calculate
 how much olefiant gas would be required, we obtain a negative value
 for the quantity of olefiant       gas from one equation, and a positive one
 from the other equation,         viz.:
    By employing for data the original volume and the carbonic acid
 generated, the value of C, H, is negative.
       Vol. of C. H. =vol. of CO,-original vol. = –0.82 per cent.
 By employing for data the original volume and the contraction, the
 value of C, H, becomes positive.
      Vol. of C, H, =# contraction—# original vol. = 1.19 per cent.
 This want of conformity shows that C, H, will not satisfy the condi
 tions of the case, and may be regarded as excluding the supposition
 that a trace even of C, H, was present in the gas examined.
    When it is considered that on Dr. Geuther's                       hypothesis      every
 volume     of carbonic acid absorbed should be replaced by an equal
 volume of olefiant gas, and when it is borne in mind that sodium
 alcohol and carbonic oxide must have been less perfectly exposed to
 mutual action in Dr. Geuther's                 experiment than in the one just
 described,    I think  the conclusion cannot be avoided, that that expe
rimenter's      formic acid came not from sodium-alcohol, but from
hydrate     of soda.
    In   a previous    experiment        I    failed to obtain propionic           acid on
exposing at 100° C. carbonic oxide along with sodium-alcohol,                           and
in  so  far my result   agrees    with that of Dr. Geuther.                               -
    To resume: at 100° C. sodium-alcohol is without action on car
bonic oxide.
    This   research  was made      in the laboratory of Prof. Bunsen.

siderably under-estimated;                   while      on      the other hand attracting masses
were supposed             to   lie   still further north which really have                          no   existence.

The author has not recomputed the total attraction of all the dis
turbing masses, but has merely given in this postscript a computation
of the meridional component of the attraction of the table-land alone.
In   accordance with the new information, the height of the table-land
is assumed to be uniform, and to be equal to 24 miles above the level
of Kaliana, that           is,
                      about 15,000 feet above the sea-level.     The
resulting northern deflections are                  as   follows:—

     Hence the errors produced                in   the astronomical amplitudes                    will      be
9".57 and 5".99, which much exceed the errors (5":236 and—3".791)

of   the Indian arc             the mean ellipticity           of     the whole earth; and the
discrepancy will        be still further increased when the attraction                            of   the
mearer masses      is   also taken into account.

  The    new information regarding the nature                           of   the country north

the particular case where the given curve is a cubic, the last-men

and Steiner, and in the same particular case, the theory of the conic
of <U+FB01>ve-pointic contact   has recently been established by      Mr. Salmon.
But the general case, where the curve is of any order whatever, has
not, so far as   I am aware,   been hitherto considered    ;—the establish

     After mentioning    various considerations      which have   tended to
invest the question of the vertebral characters of the Pterodactyles
with peculiar interest;     above   all, in reference   to carrying  out the
comparison of their skeleton with that of birds; the author alludes
to the scanty information on the subject already on record, which—
with the exception of       a remark     of Professor    Quensted as to the
apparently proccelian characters observed by him in a dorsal ver
 tebra of Pterodactylus Suevieus, and the apparent want of the
 trochlear form in the cervical articulations of that animal--affords no
 available data for comparing the vertebral mechanism of these rep
 tiles with that of other vertebrata         adapted for <U+FB02>ight;     he then
 gives a summary of his own observations, made,             as opportunities
 presented themselves, for some years past.
     From investigations of species of Pterosauria extending from the
 period of the Lias, as exempli<U+FB01>ed by the Dimorphodon macronyx, to
 the upper green-sand, as exempli<U+FB01>ed by the Pterodactylus Sedgwickii
 and    Pier. Fittoni, the author    has    ascertained the fact, that, with
 respect to the cervical and dorso-lumbar vertebrae, the terminal ar
 ticular surfaces of the vertebral bodies are simply concave anteriorly
 and convex posteriorly,      and that they consequently manifest the
 earliest known instance of the “procoslian”           type which now pre
 vails in the reptilian class.     But in no other reptile    are those arti

                                         704
   cular surfaces so narrow vertically, in proportion           to  their bre
  as they are    in the cervical      vertebrae   of the Pterosauria:         in
  dorsal series the cup and ball present more ordinary Saurian
  portions.
     Besides these principal and more general characters, those also w
  distinguish the vertebrae of the several regions of the spine, toge
  with the specialities of the atlas and axis, and of other indivi
  vertebrae, are pointed out and described.
      The Paper is illustrated      by numerous <U+FB01>gures, which (excep

     The peculiarly beautiful properties of these integrals,         as treate
 Jacobi and (in his two supplements) by Legendre,                   are    obtai
through so very elaborate        and dif<U+FB01>cult     a process,  that few stud
can afford the time to study them.              Professor De Morgan,         in
‘
   Integral Calculus,’ declines to enter even the Lower Theory,              on
ground that the subject requires a detailed treatise.             _That in so
sense   it is analogous to trigonometry,       which no one would desire
be   treated fully in the differential and integral calculus,        has been
cognized by several     writers.     Legendre, in his second suppleme
Sixth section,   took the <U+FB01>rst steps toward treating         J acobi’s   functi
(A and 6) on     a wholly independent       basis, by investigating their p
perties from the series which they represent:             but after only t
pages    of this sort, he aids his research by assuming their             relati

to elliptic integrals as already established, which shows that he was
not seeking for                  a new         basis     of argument, but only for             new proper
ties.  The author of the present paper proposes (for didactic pur
poses) to commence the higher theory from these functions.          The
<U+FB01>rst division of his essay is purely algebraic and trigonometrical, not
introducing the idea of elliptic integrals at all.                                     Adopting   as the de<U+FB01>

cosines, diminished    the product          by
                                       the sines                           of                          of   the other two.

     If we      pass from the circle to the ellipse, the addition                          of the arcs
becomes more complicated, the product of the sines being multiplied
by    a radical.       This relation was first obtained by Euler as the inte
gral of a       differential equation.  I have called it elsewhere, for con
venience, the elliptic equation between three amplitudes.                                     Moreover,
we    are no longer able to take the simple sum                         of the    arcs,   but      we have
to add in an algebraic quantity, which is                          a   multiple    of     the products
of the sines of the three amplitudes.
     The comparison of hyperbolic arcs hitherto has                                 been matter           of
still greater complexity,                 as   it has    been      usually handled simply by
reducing each hyperbolic arc to two elliptic arcs.                                 The complexity,
of course, is thus doubled.
     It seemed         to me, however, that the ellipse is so completely the
analogue of the hyperbola, and that                         it is so   easy to pass from one to
the other by an imaginary transformation, that a similar analogy
ought to pervade the comparison of their arcs. Hence that there
must exist           some formula            for the comparison             of hyperbolic arcs,           as
simple as that for elliptic arcs.
     A slight modification              of Jacobi's second theorem has enabled me to
find the analogue which                  I   required.
     If we      take Euler's elliptic equation, and substitute the following
changes,
            cosine     of amplitude into secant of amplitude,
            sine     of amplitude into tangent amplitude x A/-I,
            sine     of modulus into cosine of modulus,
we leave the equation entirely unaltered, except in form.                                     Even this
form may be obtained directly by a simple transformation, of purely
algebraic character.   Hence it follows that                            all   the consequences            of
this imaginary transformation are allowable.
  If       we   apply these transformations                   to   the elliptic integral            of   the
first kind,       we have      Jacobi's second theorem.
 If        we   apply themthe integral
                                to       the second kind, which repre

sents the elliptic arc, we pass, after an obvious              the arc
of   the hyperbola.            The algebraic addition                  to   the sum   of   the arcs       is
simply changed from                 a   product   of   sines    toproduct
                                                                    a               of

     Other considerations               enable    us   to verify the theorem, when once
it   is   obtained.         These verifications are merely algebraic, and would
scarcely        be   intelligible   if   read aloud.

     By the help         of     my formula,              I     have succeeded                   in   reducing the case
where the parameter                      is      negative and greater than unity.                                  The steps
are the mere counterpart                            of   Legendre's work                    in     the second supple

     Both Legendre's                 case and mine are                      of     the logarithmic                 form, and
can therefore           be   reduced               to   one another            by   algebraic transformation.

As the fonnation of              these acids from glycol is analogous to the pro
duction of acetic acid from ethylic alcohol, it may be assumed                                          that
the bibasic oxalic acid stands to the biatomic glycol in the same rela
tion as the fatty acids do to their corresponding alcohols.                                       Alcohol
is not converted at once into acetic acid, an intermediate substance
aldehyde—-being formed.                    The formation of               a    similar body from gly
col is highly probable.                  If two or four
                                                     of hydrogen be removed

from glycol, an          aldehyde of the composition of acetic acid or of the
formula C,       H,    02 may be produced.                   Glyoxal, obtained by the oxida
tion of ethylic alcohol, has indeed the composition corresponding to
the above formula and the characteristic properties of an aldehyde.
Nitric acid converts it rapidly into oxalic acid.                                Consequently glycol,
glyoxal, and oxalic acid bear a similar relation to each other as ethylic
alcohol, aldehyde, and acetic do.

nation with one atom                of water.            I treated      glycol, which was diluted
with water, with fuming nitric acid at about 30°C., and evaporated
the acid liquid, as soon as the action was completed, on the water
bath until it assumed the consistency of syrup".   This residue was
found to contain, as previously shown by Wurtz, oxalic and glycolic
acids; but        I also found        therein glyoxylic acid and a body which                         com
ported itself with some reagents like glyoxal.                                     Want of material,
however, prevented its being identified with the latter.
     Before      I proceed to make some observations                          on these facts,       I shall
first mention a few salts of glyoxylic acid not yet described.
                       Glyoxylate of silver, C.HAgO,                          +H, O,
is obtained        as a white erystalline                   powder when nitrate               of silver is
precipitated with glyoxylate                     of ammonia.             This salt is but slightly
soluble in cold water, and is decomposed by light with great rapidity.
                     Glyoxylate           of baryta, C, HBaO,--2H, O.
     Diluted glyoxylic acid is digested at common temperatures with                                      car
bonate      of   baryta until the acid is completely neutralized, and the                                 fil
tered solution evaporated in vacuo.    As soon as the liquid has arrived
at a certain degree of concentration, small white crystals of glyoxylate
of baryta begin to separate. This compound is partially decomposed
into oxalate of baryta and glycolic acid if it be heated to 120°C., or
if   the temperature of                  its   watery solution           be   raised     to   the   boiling
point. With nitrate                 of   silver, acetate         of   lead, and lime-water,         it   com
ports itself like glyoxylate                   of   lime.
                          Glyoxylate           of zinc,     C,   Zn,   O,--2H,      O,

But with this view the capacity of saturation of glycolic acid does
not agree.  For according to our present experience, if we adopt the
fonnula C,        H, 0,. it      evidently combines only with one atom of base.
Before we have discovered compounds represented by the general
expression C,       H, M, 0,, I think              we are not justi<U+FB01>ed         to place glycolic
acid in the same relation to glycol as we do acetic acid to common
alcohol.       According to our present knowledge, this position must be
assigned to oxalic acid.
  We can represent                to our minds the derivation                 of glycolic acid
from acetic acid in the following manner.                        If in   acetic acid one atom
of hydrogen        be replaced by peroxide               of hydrogen,         we obtain a body
which has the composition of glycolic acid.
                            C,   II,   0.,          =acetic acid.
                            C,   H3    (H0) O,=glycolic           acid.
But, according to the following observations, this view appears not
to be correct; for glycolic acid can be formed from glycolide and
water, and probably also again can be resolved                           into these two sub
stances      in   the same way as lactid and water by their union produce
lactic acid, and the decomposition of the latter by heat yields lactid
again.       If, therefore, peroxide of hydrogen                  be contained       in   glycolic
acid,   it   must be present           in   glycolide.
   If monochlorinated             acetate      of potash     be decomposed,        according to
Kekule, glycolic acid and glycolide are formed.                          The formation of the
latter precedes that of the glycolic acid but                ;     if    the monochlorinated
acetate      of potash could       be obtained anhydrous, no doubt only glyco
lide would         result    from       its decomposition.           The monochlorinated
acetate of potash can be represented as consisting of three parts,—of
potassium, of oxygen, and of chlorinated acetyle.

          According to its formation, the glycolide cannot contain any pero
          of hydrogen, and consequently     appears that also glycolic acid          it
          not be considered as acetic acid wherein one atom of hydrogen

        March 17, 1859.
                                        (Abstract)
     The Transactions of     the    Royal Society contain the <U+FB01>rst Life-Table         :
it   was constructed by Halley, who discovered its remarkable proper
ties, and illustrated some of its applications.
     With better data improved methods               have been found out, and the
form has been extended so as to facilitate the solution of various
questions.
      In deducing the English Life-Tables from the National Returns,                 I
have had occasion to try various methods of construction;                 and   I now
propose to describe brie<U+FB02>y the nature of the Life-Table, to lay down
a simple method        of construction, to describe      an extension    of its form,
and to illustrate this by      a new      Table representing the vitality of the
healthiest part of the population of England.
      The Life-Table is an instrument of investigation; it may be called
a    biometer, for it gives the exact measure of the duration of life under
given circumstances.          Such a Table has to be constructed for each
district       and for each profession, to determine their degrees of salu
brity.       To multiply   these    constructions, then, it is necessary to lay
                                                                                          '
down rules, which, while they involve a minimum                 amount       of arith-
metical labour, will yield results as correct as can be obtained in the
present state of our observations.
      A Life-Table     represents   a   generation of men passing through time ;
and time under this aspect, dating from birth, is called age.                   In the
<U+FB01>rst column of a Life-Table age is expressed                in years, commencing
at 0 (birth),        and proceeding to 100 or to 110 years,             the extreme
limit of observed lifetime. Annexed is an outline of the two primary
series of the Life-Table, representing the surviving at each year of
age    (I, ,   and the <U+FB01>rst differences representing the dying     (J,   ,   in annual
intervals of age.

     The Table may be read thus: of 100,000                           children born, 10,295
 die in the <U+FB01>rst year, 89,705 survive.
     It will    be observed        that, upon the hypothesis that the annual
 births equal the annual deaths in number, and that the law of mortal
 ity remains invariable, the series of the living (1,) can be constructed
 from the series of numbers ((1,) representing                      the dying, or from the
 numbers     dying at different ages, as returned in the parish registers.
That course was adopted by Halley, and afterwards by Dr. Price, in
constructing the Northampton                    Table.         But    the hypothesis           of  an
invariable annual number of births equalling the deaths has never
been veri<U+FB01>ed by observation,               and consequently            tables on the plan          of
Halley’s are often exceedingly erroneous.                       In the healthiest districts
of England the births were                29,715,       the deaths 17,469 annually: a
Table constructed upon that plan, like Dr. Price’s, makes the mean
lg’/'etime—or        as it is   sometimes        called,     the expectation        of   life-—t'or
Northampton,            25   years,     while     the      mean     lifetime by        a    correct
Northampton Table is 38 years.
     It is shown by a diagram that                   if  age         is represented         by the
abscissas, the numbers living             (6,) will      be represented by the ordinates
of    a curve.        De Moivre      constructed this curve by assuming                         that
the series    I,   is from the age 12 to 86, in arithmetical progression;
decreasing      thus, 74, 73, 72        . . .   3, 2, 1, 0.       By another        hypothesis,
the rate    of mortality       is assumed       to decrease or to increase in geome
trical progression         at different      rates in di<U+FB02>'erent         periods     of life  ;   and
it  is found that this hypothesis represents                    the results deduced            from
the observed facts approximatively.
     As 1:, the velocity, expresses a ratio, so m, the rate of mortality,
 is the ratio of the number dying to the number
                                                                          living in a unit of

time.        Now       if y   represent the living at a definite age, and                                    r the rate
at which the mortality increases at that point of                                            age, then mr                will
be the rate of mortality after the lapse of 2 units of time. The
decrement of y in an infinitely short time will be dy=ymr"dz.
This was pointed out by Mr. Gompertz, and Mr. Edmonds subse
quently extended the theory.    This expression can be integrated,
                                                                                                             k2nn,
                                                                                                                     1-r”)
and the final equation of the corrected integral is                                              y=10”
where A is put for the common logarithm, and k for                                                its   modulus.
    Either        of    the hypotheses gives                   a     close approximation                to     the exact
result, within short intervals                            of   time; and the results by the two
hypotheses agree                           the principal             ages after 20, when they can

    The new Life-Tables consist of three sections,—the first represent
ing persons, the second males, and the third females, each section
consisting of six columns.        On the opposite page is an extract from
the first of the sectional Tables.
    The properties of    these columns are described, and a collection     of
useful    formulas is added.     The curious and useful properties of the
new column y are illustrated.
     The mean annual mortality in England was at the rate of 22 in
 1000; but in eighteen districts the mortality ranged from 28 to 36
in 1000, and in sixty-four        districts the mortality  ranged from 15
to 16 and 17 in 1000;        in the other districts it was at intermediate
rates.      The Table has      been  constructed  from sixty-three    of the
districts in which the mortality did not exceed 17 in 1000.
     Halley first pointed out some of the financial applications of the
 Life-Table, and the new Table shows that the mean duration of life
among large classes of the population exceeds considerably the            ex
pectations of life deduced from the ordinary Tables.         The  science  of
public health has      been developed since Halley's day; and here a
 new application    of the Life-Table is found. If we ascertain at what
rate a generation      of men die away under the least unfavourable
 existing   circumstances, we obtain a standard by which the loss of
 life under other circumstances is measured; and this        I have endea
voured to accomplish in the New Life-Table.           And recollecting that
 the science of public health     was almost inaugurated   in England by a
 former    President  of this Society, who crowned the sanitary dis
 coveries   of Captain Cook,    I feel assured that the Society will receive
 with favour this imperfect attempt to supply sanitary inquirers with
 a scientific instrument.

     The following communications        were read  :
  I. “ On    the means by which the Actiniae          kill their Prey.”       By
        AUGUSTUS WALLER,           M.D., F.R.S., Professor of Physiology
        in Queen’s College, Birmingham.                 In a Letter to Dr
         SHARPEY, Sec. R.S. Received March 11, 1859.
     In  the ‘ Proceedings  of the Royal Society’ for    the 18th November,
  p. 478,   I perceive  that Dr. M‘Donnell’s fresh        observations  on the
  Actiniaa have led him to abandon the opinion which he had been
  disposed to entertain as to their possessing electrical powers similar
  to those of the torpedo.      During a stay at the sea-side in the winte
  of 1857-58,      I put in hand some experiments for the purpose               o
  testing the supposed      electrical powers of these      animals,  which,    a
  I  some months since        mentioned to you, led me to negative          con
  clusions relative to their siderant power.          Dr. M‘Donnell’s recent
  observations    having removed      any occasion    of controversy,     I  wil
  brie<U+FB02>y mention the results that      I obtained.
     The most interesting fact observed by Dr. M‘Donnell is the
  contraction of the galvanoscopic frog when the Actinia seized upon
  the sciatic nerve.     On repeating this experiment,       I was particularly
  struck by the uncertainty and irregularity          with which these con
  tractions were obtained, being sometimes very strong, while at others
  they were imperceptible, notwithstanding all the precautions that
  could take as to the frogs being fresh caught and irritable, besides
  attending to the rules laid down by Matteucci.
     On the other hand, when, in lieu of a galvanoscopic frog,            I  pre
  sented a Nereis to the Actinia,     the result was invariably the death o
V
  the animal.     The  effect  of the Actinia’s grasp upon     the Annulata     i
  mortal, although the retention may not have been allowed to exceed
  a few moments.       The <U+FB01>rst symptom which I observed was that o
  writhing,   as if the creature    were in great pain, and which        in   the
   most marked cases was succeeded by                                     of
                                              paralysis with <U+FB01>accidity        the
   muscles, like a frog acted upon by woorara.             The action    of   the

                                                       723
dorsal vessel, which still persisted long after the loss                                     of voluntary
power, was very irregular and segmental, the vessel being bloodless
and inert at intervals.
    It   appeared indifferent                   whether       the cephalic or the caudal                       ex
tremity of the Nereis                   was attacked by the             Actinia, similar symptoms
being produced in both cases.                                                                   -
    In    order to ascertain how far these symptoms were produced by
electricity,        I    subjected the Nereis enclosed in a glass tube to some
violent shocks by means of an electro-magnetic machine, which were
merely productive of a slight temporary inconvenience to the animal,
unattended by any after evil effects.                                It is   most remarkable what
powerful electric action these                        creatures are susceptible              of enduring
without injury; the strongest action of an electro-magnetic machine
on Du Bois Reymond's principle, which affected                                  myself violently up
to the elbows, appeared to be easily endured by them.
    The    above experiment                   is quite sufficient to show how impossible it
is to attribute           the fatal influence            of the Actiniae to simple electrical
action.
    In    order to elucidate the real power of the Actiniae—after                                        having
in vain exposed the finger on which the cuticle had                                      been softened by
soaking in water—considering                           that the tongue was better adapted
for the purpose in view, by reason of the thinness of                                        its    cuticle,       I
presented         its    apex                              of   an   Actinia mesembryanthemum,
                                of to
                                        the tentacles
of   about the size                 a        half-crown piece.          The result was such                  as     to
satisfy     the         most     sceptical         respecting the offensive weapons with
which     it   is   furnished.               The animal       seized the organ most vigorously,
and was detached from                    it    with   some    difficulty after the lapse             of    about
a   minute.             Immediately            a   pungent acrid pain commenced, which
continued           to   increase for some minutes until                       it   became          extremely
distressing.             The point attacked felt inflamed and much swollen,
although       to       the eye         no   change   in   the part could           be   detected. These
symptoms continued unabated for about                                  an    hour, and      a   slight tem
porary relief was only obtained                          by   immersing the tongue                  in   cold       or
warm water.               After this period the symptoms gradually abated, and
about four hours later, they had entirely disappeared.                                          day
                                                                                                           of or
                                                                                            A                  two
after,    a    very minute ulceration was perceived over the apex                                                  the
tongue, which disappeared after being touched with nitrate                                           of    silver.

and others, using greater precaution, and have invariably obtained
similar symptoms of urtication.                               In     only one instance has a minute
ulceration been the consequence.
     It is   very evident therefore that the Actiniae act by means                                             of an
acrid irritant poison, similar in some respects to that of the wasp, or
of snakes, which quickly spreads through the system of the Annelida,
producing the above-mentioned results.
     It   remained to determine whether the poisoned weapons existing
in such numbers over the surface of the Actiniae                                       were   left in the part
attacked.          For this purpose                    I   stretched a thin India-rubber mem
brane over            a   glass tube.                After     its   seizure     by    the Actinia,     I   found
that under the microscope                          it   was studded            in     many points with the
poison darts inserted slightly                        in     the membrane, without their having
penetrated through.                        In      this respect my observations differ from
those      of    Mr.      Gosse, who considers that                fragment
                                                                          a    cuticle from   of
the hand was perforated                         by   these darts.

                                                     (Abstract.)
  The author notices that the problem                                             finding the number                of
double tangents was first solved by Plücker                                   in of   1834 from geometrical
considerations, and                   he   gives      a    sketch        of   the subsequent history                of
the problem.                   The complete analytical determination                               of   the double
tangents was only obtained very recently                                  by   Mr. Salmon, and            is   given

there shown that the                   (n–2)          points       in   which the tangent           at   any point
of   a    curve       of       the order       n   again meets the curve, are given                         as   the
points       of  intersection             of   the tangent with           acertain curve   the orderof
(n–2);           if   this curve           be   touched         by    the tangent, then the point                   of

     The glycol employed                 in     the     following        research was                prepared
according        to   Dr. Atkinson's excellent method",                            to   whom      is   due the
credit     of    having      first substituted              acetate     of   potash for acetate                of
silver    in   its   preparation.        He was not the first, however,                         to     prepare
it   from bromide            of   ethylene,        as   M. Wurtz has            been     in    the habit       of
preparing        it   from that body for the last two years.
     The following           slight    modification              ofDr. Atkinson's method will
be   found very convenient, particularly                          when large quantities  gly           of
col are     to   be   prepared.         Instead         of    heating the materials for                   form
ing the monoacetate               of   glycol      in   a   close vessel, they are heated                   in a
large balloon, connected with                  a    Liebig’s condenser              in   such      a   manner
as   to   cause the condensed vapours                       to   flow back into the balloon.

salt sulphoglycolate               of baryta.            It   is analogous in composition to
the sulphoglycerate                of baryta obtained by M. Pelouze.           This salt
does not readily crystallize.                     It is almost insoluble in ether and in
absolute alcohol, but freely soluble in water.                                  It   is somewhat         deli
quescent.            Exposure to the temperature                     of 100° Cent.            causes   slight

This body differs from the chloracetime                                    in             boiling-point, which                 is

also establish            a    difference between these bodies.                                  Both give chloride

compounds find their places                         in   two very remarkable series                                  of   iso
