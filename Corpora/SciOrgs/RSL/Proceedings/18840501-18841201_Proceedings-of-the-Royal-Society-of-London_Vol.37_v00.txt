    1.  The original statement made by Gratiolet that the optic tract is
directly connected with every part of the cerebral hemisphere in
 man, from the frontal to the occipital region, is almost literally true.
     von. xxxvn.‘                                                      'B

2         On the Cortical Connexions            of  the Optic Nerve-s.      [May 1,
   2. The origins of the optics may be divided into two sets——
ganglionic and cortical.
   3. The <U+FB01>bres in the ganglionic set are derived from the corpora
geniculata, pulvinar and corpora quadrigemina, probably also directly
from the substance of the thalamus.
   4. The cortical set join the chiasma and tract.
   5. The junction of the chiasma with the cerebral cortex is brought
                          “                                 The latter arises from
about by means of            Meynert’s commissure.”
the lenticular-nucleus-loop        (Linsen-kern-schlinge), decussates in the
lamina cinerea, and passes with the optic nerve of the opposite side.
This commissure is connected to the cortex in the frontal region by
the following means :—
   It arises directly from the lenticular-nucleus-loop; the lenticular
nucleus-loop is formed by the junction, below the lenticular nucleus,
of the strias medullares; the strise medullares form part of the
<U+FB01>bres of the inner capsule, and the inner capsule is composed of the
<U+FB01>bres descending from the cortex.                I should think it very probable
that the <U+FB01>bres constituting        the  striw    medullares  come from the cortex
of the same side.
   6. The other cortical connexions of the optic join the tract as it
winds round the pedunculus cerebri.                They are the following :—
   (a.) A large mass of <U+FB01>bres derived from the motor areas of the
opposite cerebral hemisphere, crossing in the corporus callosum, enter       '
ing the outer capsule, and joining the tract directly.
   (1).) A great number of <U+FB01>bres uniting it to the temporo-sphenoidal
lobe of the same side, and especially the <U+FB01>rst and second temporal
convolutions.
   (0.) A bundle of <U+FB01>bres, which spreads out into the gyrus hippo
campi of the same side.
   (0L) A large leash of <U+FB01>bres, which connects it directly with the
                                                         “
tip of the occipital lobe forming part of the              optic radiation.”
   7. The tract is     in  all probability   further    connected  to the cerebral
cortex indirectly, that is to say, by the intervention of the ganglionic
masses, in the following manner :—To the occipital lobe of the same
side, through its connexion with the corpora geniculata and pulvinar,
and the continuation of <U+FB01>bres from these backwards.
   8. It is extremely doubtful whether the anterior corpus quadri
gerninum is connected to the occipital . lobe of the opposite side by a
continuous band.
             “
   9. The       optic radiation” of Gratiolet going to the occipital lobe
is composed       of the following constituents :—
    (a.) A  branch to the optic tract directly.
    (b,)       ,,         ,,   corpus geniculatum internum.
    (0.)       ,,         ,,      ,,          ,,        externum.
   (d_)        H          ,,   pulvinar.

    188-1.]    7716  Himalaya Snowfall and Dry Winds in India:               3
       ( e.) A branch to the substance of the thalmus.
       (f.)  The   direct sensitive band joining the posterior third of the
   posterior limb of the inner capsule.
      (9.) A large mass of <U+FB01>bres which runs between the Island of Reil
   and the tip of the occipital lobe.
      10. In the evolution of the brain it seems very probable that the
   functions of the thalamus and corpora quadrigemina as optic centres
   are transferred in man and certain mammals in great part to the
   cerebral cortex.
      11. The cortical <U+FB01>bres which      I have described are probably not all
   connected    with   visual centres, but are one means by which motor and
  other centres of the cortex are educated, and their function elicited
  in response to visual stimuli.
  II.    “ On the Connexion         of the Himalaya      Snowfall with Dry
          Winds and Seasons of Drought            in India.”   By HENRY F.
          BLANFORD,      F.R.S. Received April       14, 1884.
     The present paper, as regards its subject-matter though not in
  form, is part of a general investigation of the rainfall of India, which
  has occupied much of my spare time for some years past, and the
 results of which are already partly embodied in a memoir which            I
  hope. in the course of a few months, to issue as an o<U+FB01>icial publication
 of the Indian Meteorological O<U+FB02>ice. The idea that the snowfall of
 the Himalaya exercises a direct and important in<U+FB02>uence on the dry
 land winds of North-Western India is not now put forward for the
 <U+FB01>rst time. It has been the subject of frequent reference in the
 annual reports on the meteorology of India since 1876. as well as
 elsewhere ; and in a report on the administration of the India Meteo
 rological Department lately issued,         I summarised very brie<U+FB02>y those
 points in the experience of the previous <U+FB01>ve years which have seemed
 to justify its provisional adoption as a basis for forecasting the
 probable character of the monsoon rains.
     Relying on this experience, in the month of June last,           I put
 forward in the Government Gazette, a note giving warning of the
 probability of a prolonged period of drought in the approaching
 monsoon season, and the result, if not in exact accordance with the
terms of the forecast, has been so far con<U+FB01>rmatory of the general
idea, as to induce me to put the facts of past experience formally on
record, and thereby challenge attention to the subject. If I am right
in the inference that the varying extent and thickness of the
Himalayan snows exercise a great and prolonged influence on the
climatic conditions and weather of the plains of North-Western India,
                                                                  B 2

  local geography, causes of a similar character will be found equally
  operative in other regions, and perhaps on an even more extensive
  scale.
                          Empirical Grounds of      the Hypothesis.
      The Year 1876 and 1877.—The               probable dependence of dry land
   winds and        of  periods    of drought (in the extent of the Himalayan

   of India in 1876, a year disastroust notorious for that failure of the
   rainfall which produced the last great famine in Madras and the
   Deccan; and the <U+FB01>rst reference to the subject, as far as I am aware,
   will be found in the o<U+FB01>icial report for that year. In summing up the
   results of the detailed description of the meteorological features of
   the year, and in tracing out the apparent dependence of the drought
   on the remarkable and unseasonable persistence of dry north

   west winds down the whole of Western India, was led on to connect
   these successively with the high pressure prevailing in the Upper
   Provinces and Bombay, relatively to Orissa and Eastern India, and
   with the low temperature of North-Western India in the spring of
   the year, as contrasted with the abnormally high temperature of the
   east of the peninsula, and          I  remarked“ that this latter fact seemed
   “ to argue that some cooling in<U+FB02>uence more
                                                               potent than usual was
   at work, probably         in  the Punjab and on the northern mountain zone,
   condensing the lower strata of the atmosphere and causing an
~
   unusual out<U+FB02>ow of cooled air.” A few lines further on, it was
                 “ it has been shown in
   observed,                                  the foregoing description of the rain
   fall, that    in  the early months of the year, the rainfall was unusually
   copious over the North-Western Himalaya<U+FB01> and the plains of the
    Punjab which border the foot of the mountains, and indeed, on the
   North-Western Himalaya the rainfall was above the average, more
    or less, throughout the greater part of the year. The rain on the
    outer hills is most frequently accompanied by snow on the main and
    higher ranges, and indeed, when I visited Rawalpindi in the early
    part of April, 1876,       I  was informed that snow lay in some thickness
    at Murree,     a   very  unusual   occurrence 0 late in the season, and the
    slopes of the Pir Punjal were visibly snowed down to a low level.
    The question is therefore naturally suggested, whether the great
    expanse of snow, presented under the circumstances by the southern
    slopes of the Himalaya, and much of which fell unusually late in the
    season, was not that cooling agent, to the existence of which the
       '  Op. cit,  page 96.
       1' As will be  seen further on, this is rather overstated.  The heavy unusual fall
    was restricted   to March and April, and the total of the whole season was not above
                                                                               ‘

  winds, the temperature, and the pressure equally testify.             That it
 was so seems not improbable.”
    The report containing these passages was written in the autumn
 of 1877, a second season of drought; but, in this year, most intense
 in the North-Western Provinces and the plateau of Rajputana and
 Central India, which provinces were swept persistently, up to the
 very close of the summer monsoon season, by parching land winds
 from the north-west and west.          In the passage immediately following
 the above quotation, this fact was noticed in the following terms :—
 “ In the
           early part of the present season (1877) the same phenomenon
 (an unusual snowfall) was repeated, and with even greater intensity,
 and this year the land winds have been so persistent in the upper
 provinces, and on the plateau south of the Ganges, as to cause an
 almost complete failure of the summer rains in that region; while
 again, those of Bengal have been up to the fall of an average
 season.” And in a postscript to the report was given an extract
 from Colonel (now General) J. P. Walker’s report on the operations
 of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, viz., a passage taken from the
 narrative report of Mr. E. C. Ryall, in charge of the Knmaon and
 Garhwal party of the Togographical Survey.           It is as follows :—“ The
 winter of 1876—1877 proved to be the severest known for many years
 past among these hills; the spring was wet and cold, and felt quite
 wintry. . . . . (The wet weather) continued with few inter
 missions till the 8th June, the most noticeable break, up to that
 time, being from the 9th April up to the 17th. . . . . Mountains
 which in ordinary years had their snow-line, at the end of April, at
an elevation of 12,000 feet above sea-level, were mantled with snow
 down to 9,000 feet, and valleys which, at that time of year, used to be
 clear of all snow up to 10,000 feet, were literally choked with snow
down to 6,000 feet; this accumulation in the valleys being caused
by snowdrifts and avalanches from the mountain sides.”
    Messrs. Hill and Archibald’s Lam—Meantime evidence of a very
important character bearing on the subject in hand, was brought to
light from a di<U+FB01>erent quarter. Shortly before the above report was
completed and sent to press, Mr. Douglas Arcln'bald‘t and Mr. J. A.
Hill,1' in discussing the rainfall of certain stations in Northern India
in connexion with the periodical sun-spot variation, a question
attracting much interest at the time, had independently arrived at a
conclusion which, although reached from a very different starting
point and empirical in form, obviously tended to con<U+FB01>rm the view
above set forth, and indeed, seemed to <U+FB01>nd its rational explanation
in that view. This was that “the winter rains of Northern India
are generally heavier when the total fall of the year is below the

 6         Mr. H. F. Blanford.          On the Connexion       of the     [May    1,
 mean than when the summer rains are excessive.” In an elaborate
 paper subsequently drawn up by Mr. Hill and published in 1879, in
 vol. i, Part 3, of the “Indian Meteorological                 Memoirs,” he has
 rediscussed the subject, at considerable length, and has put forward
 his matured views based on much more extensive evidence.                 Instead,
 therefore,   of  quoting    further  from  his  or    Mr.   Archibald’s   original
            I
 writings, will take the statement of his conclusions as set forth in
 the postscript to his later paper.      This is as follows :—*These results
 strongly support my original conclusion, that the winter rains are
 heaviest when the summer rains are defective, and nice versci.               They
 also support the idea put forward by Mr. Blanford, in his report for
 1876, that an unusual amount of precipitation over Northern India
and the Himalaya, in winter and spring, may, by modifying the
normal distribution of pressure, cause the rainfall of the succeeding
summer to be defective in the Gangetic Valley, though of course
they throw no light on the question of the in<U+FB02>uence of the Himalayan
snowfall on the meteorology of the Bombay Presidency.
    “ Thus the
                  following twelve years had the winter rainfall excessive,
and that of the summer defective, viz., 1845, 1850, 1851, 1852,
1853, 1859, 1865, 1866, 1868, 1869, 1877, and 1878; and the thirteen
years 1846,      1847,  1854,   1856,  1858, 1861,     1862,   1863,  1867,   1871,
1873,   1874,    and 1875, had dry winters followed by wet summers.
Against these twentyl<U+FB01>ve instances in favour of the rule, we have
only three years, 1855, 1870, and 1872 with the rainfall excessive at
both seasons, and six years, 1848, 1849, 1857, 1860, 1864, and 1876,
with a de<U+FB01>ciency both in summer and winter.”
    The Contrast of the Mountain Winter Rainfall and Summer Rainfall
on Plains.—Mr.         Hill’s conclusion, as above stated, is based on a
comparison of the winter rainfall (November to April) of the North
Western Provinces, with that of the summer (May to October) in the
same area, and the statistics of the former term of comparison, as
well as those of the latter, are furnished therefore chie<U+FB02>y by stations
on the plains of Northern India. In general, no doubt, precipitation
on the mountain zone varies more or less pari pass/u, with that on
the plains. But still, this is only true as a rough generalisation.
 The terms involved in the hypothesis now under discussion are
strictly and rigorously, on the one hand, the winter and spring snow
fall on the hills, and on the other, the summer monsoon rainfall on
the plains. Moreover, Mr. Hill has included in the summer rainfall
that of the month of May.             As regards the plains this is perhaps
admissible, but in the North-Western Provinces the May rainfall is not,
strictly speaking, that of the summer monsoon rains. It is either
due to diurnal storms, or to 'what is known as the chhota ba'rszit, or
little rains, a burst of rainy weather, which frequently precedes the

regular rains, and is followed by a fortnight or more of dry hot
weather.     On the hills, as occurred in the present year (1883), it
frequently takes the form of snow on the higher ranges, and when
very copious is rather prejudicial to the monsoon rains.

    In the following table, therefore, have taken as representing the
winter and spring rainfall, the total from January to May inclusive
at twelve stations, either on the Himalaya or situated immediately at
its foot. The table gives the annual precipitation since 1864 (as far
as it is on record) in the form of percentages of the local averages for
the same season, and the last line but one is the means of the <U+FB01>gures
in each column. The last line shows the subsequent summer rain
fall of the North-Western Provinces, also in the form of a percentage
of the general average of that season; the <U+FB01>gures up to 1878 being
taken from Mr. Hill’s memoir.
    As might have been anticipated from the stricter character of the
test now applied, the results shown in the above table are even more
favourable to the hypothesis than those educed by Mr. Hill. Of the
 eighteen years enumerated in the table, fourteen give con<U+FB01>rmatory
 and only four adverse evidence.         And of these four- years, one (1876)
 is that the conditions of which originally suggested the hypothesis as
 already recounted above, and another (1880) apparently the most
 discrepant of all,     I shall presently refer to, as affording in the very
 anomalies two of the most striking illustrative instances of its
 validity.   The remaining two exceptional years, 1866 and 1872,            I
 have no means of satisfactorily investigating.
    The year of the heaviest winter and spring rains, shown in the
 table (1877), is that already referred to as one of an almost unpre
 cedentedly heavy snowfall in the Himalaya, and it is also that of the
 smallest summer rainfall of the eighteen years. The two years which
 come next in order of winter raininess, viz., 1878 and 1865, had
comparatively but a small de<U+FB01>ciency of the summer rainfall. But it
is certain that the Himalayan snowfall in the early months of 1878
was far from being comparable with that of the previous winter.
 Nevertheless, the rains were much retarded, so much so, as to give
 rise to serious anxiety.      In the North-Western Provinces there was
scarcely any heavy rain before the 6th or 7th of July, and after a
few day’s fall, a break set in which lasted up to the end of the month<U+FB01>“
    The experience of this year, and also that of 1876, and, as will
 presently be shown, that of 1880, proves then, that the copiousness of
 the winter and spring rainfall 0n the outer Himalaya is by no means
an exact criterion of that of the snowfall on the higher ranges ; and
it is only appealed to in evidence, in the absence of any regular
reports on the snows, with which we are more immediately concerned.
But apart from this consideration,        I  may here observe, that there was

 northern summers of 1876 and 1877 it was even more excessive in
 extra-tropical Asia on the one hand, and in Australia (in the southern
 winter) on the other, than in India. It was probably the presence of
 this condition in the monsoons of 1876 and 1877 and its absence in
 the latter part of that of 1878 which in part, at least, determined the
 differences in the rainfall of these years.    Still, this is no argument
 against the local in<U+FB02>uence of the Himalayan snows, for which there
 is ample independent evidence.       It only shows that the latter were
 not-the sole cause operating   in those years.            .
     To return to the consideration of the facts shown by the table.
 The two years with the smallest winter rainfall, viz., 1879 and 1870,1
 when it amounted respectively to only 54 and 66 per cent. of the
 general winter average, were years of very plentiful summer rains,
 that of 1879 being one of the highest on record, and one-third in
 excess of the average, while that of 1870 was as much as 21 per cent.
 in excess. In three other years, in which the excess of the summer
 rains amounted to as much or nearly as much as in 1879, the winter
rainfall on the North-Western Himalaya had been from 10' to 13 per
cent. below the general average.
    Evidence of the Exceptional Year, 1880.—-The facts of the de<U+FB01>cient
rainfall of 1880, both in the winter and summer seasons, are of
especial interest in relation to the present discussion. In this year
the winter rainfall was on the whole considerably below the average,
but in February there was a heavy fall of snow on the North
Western Himalaya, when according to a report received from the
Commissioner of Kumaon, General Sir H. Ramsay, “ the fall of snow
in Almora came down to a lower altitude than it had been known to
do for many years”: Further, with respect to the mountains around

        is noteworthy that Mr. Hill adduces 1870 as a year of winter rainfall above
the average, and therefore as affording adverse evidence. This is,of course, due to
the different method in which he has treated the data.

 10        Mr. H.  F. Blanford.      On the Connexion       of  the [May 1,
 the sources of the Ganges, the report states “ The winter has been an
 exceedingly severe one ; snow fell at Srinagar (in the Ganges valley),
 Ramri, Palinda (a few miles north of Katawara), places where it was
 seldom seen.”    The months of March and April which followed were
 of excessive dryness.      Scarcely a drop of rain fell in these two
months    on  the plains  of  the North-Western Provinces, the Punjab,
 Rajputana, or Central India, and in May, June, and July, except in
the Punjab and the most northerly of the adjacent districts of the
North-Western Provinces, the fall was considerably below the average
But in June and July there was heavy rain in the Eastern Punjab
and on the North-Western Himalaya.              In July, “on the hills the
rain was almost continuous; at Dharmsala, there was but one day in
the month on which no rain was registered, and at Simla but seven
days.”*     The rain was equally heavy in the hills of Kumaon and
 Garhwal, and as appeared from information subsequently received
the precipitation extended far into the heart of the mountain zone.
Major Biddulph, then stationed at Gilgit, in the north-west of Cash
mere, wrote to me to the e<U+FB01>ect that the weather was unusually
stormy in Northern Cashmere throughout July, and that “ the rain
and snowfall on the mountains have been such as are unprecedented
at this season.” Also a letter from the Reverend Mr. Heyde, stationed
at Kailong in Lahoul, reported “such weather as Major Biddulph
experienced in July of this year . . . . we certainly had also in
Lahoul, about the same time. It commenced on the 1st July with
heavy rain, which, after a few hours, changed to snow, and lasted
till the 6th. The snow fell heavily for three successive days, doing
much harm.       Ponies, cattle, sheep, and goats grazing on the higher
hills perished in large numbers in the snow, &c.” This unseason
able snowfall was followed, in August, by an almost entire suspension
of the rains on the plains of N orth-Western India. As described in
the of<U+FB01>cial report on the meteorology of the year, “August was
conspicuously a dry month in India, and to some extent in Burmah.
Indeed the last half of the month was almost rainless in Northern
India; and dry westerly winds set in, which recalled, for the time,
the disastrous seasons of 1876 and 1877, and seemed to justify the
most gloomy forebodings.”         In the Western Punjab there was no
rain, and in the Eastern Punjab and the North-Western Provinces,
except in the eastern districts and in Kumaon, it was practically
rainless after the 12th or 14th. In Rajputana and the States of
Central India, although the rainfall of the month was very de<U+FB01>cient,
the de<U+FB01>ciency, except in the eastern States, was much less than on
the Gangetic plain and in the Punjab.            Even in the Central Pro
vinces, with one or two exceptions, the fall was very de<U+FB01>cient.
   It is not then too much to say that this very exceptional year (as

 with the summer rainfall on the plains) a<U+FB01>ords some of the most
striking evidence in support of the hypothesis that the snows favour
the production of dry land winds on the plains, and is eminently one
 of those exceptions that tend to prove the rule.                           7
    Negative  Evidence   of  the  Years  1881  and   1882—1      may pass rapidly
 over the years 1881 and 1882, which presented no feature of striking
 importance.      The winter of 1880—81 was one of light snowfall.
 There was a moderate fall in March, 1881, and the succeeding April
 and May were dry and seasonable, characterised chie<U+FB02>y in Rajputana
and Central India by hot land winds of somewhat more than usual
steadiness.‘     The rains set in and came to an end somewhat earlier
than usual, but the rainfall, with merely-local exceptions, was well up
to the average, and in some parts of Northern India somewhat
above it.
    The winter of 1881—82 also was on the whole dry and mild.                     In
Kumaon, Sir H. Ramsay reported it as “unusually mild;” and
                                                                               “
Mr. Ney Elias, writing from Leh, on the 5th April, stated that, the
snow has been extraordinarily light this year in Ladak, and the
 winter altogether unusually mild . . . . Even high altitudes
                                                               “ I hear from Dias
are much less covered than usua .” But he adds,
that the snow on the outer range (at and near the Yogi pass) is as
heavy as ever. In fact, the snowfall is very partial and irregular in
these mountains.” The rains set in early and copiously on the Bombay
side; and up to the end of July, in Western and N orth-Western
India, were even excessive ; but a change took place in August, and
though there was no period of actual drought, the fall during a part
of August was light throughout the north-west of India, and not
withstanding the recurrence of heavy rain in the latter part of the
month, the total fall of the season was somewhat below the average
in the N orth-Western Provinces, ' and more so in the eastern than in
the western districts.
    The Year 1883. Forecast of Drought and the Result—In previous
years, the available information respecting the snowfall had been
meagre, and had had reference to only one or two districts in the
Himalaya.      But having now been convinced of the high importance
of the subject, I took steps, by private correspondence, and of<U+FB01>cially
with the aid of the local governments, to obtain more numerous and
detailed reports.    In December, 1882, and the early part of January,
1883, the season was <U+FB01>ne and warm; but on the 10th the ordinary
cold weather rains set in in the upper provinces, and snow fell at
Taini-Tel and some other stations. During the remainder of the
month the falls were frequently repeated on all parts of the North
Western Himalaya, and from the night of the 24th to that of the
   * Report on the Meteorology   of India in 1881, pp. 85, 86, 111, 171, 175, &c.

 12          Mr. H. F. Blanford.        0n   the Comem'on     of   the     [May   1,
 27th snow fell almost without intermission, and down to levels at
which it has rarely been known. At Simla it accumulated to a
thickness of 5 feet, on surfaces free from drifts, and even at Rawal
pindi, at a distance from the mountains, on the plain of the Patwar,
and only 1700 feet above the sea, it lay to a depth of 4 inches on the
night of the 27th, an occurrence stated to be without precedent in
the memory of the inhabitants.             At Murree, the De uty Commis
sioner reports the total aggregate fall of January to have been
26 feet, but this seems to require con<U+FB01>rmation, if by this statement
it is implied that the measurement was made in undrifted snow. At
Chamba it was stated to be 9 or 10 feet.
    The falls were repeated frequently in February and March, though
less heavily, and these additions to the unmelted residue of the
previous accumulation caused the mountains to retain their snow
mantle down to low levels at a time when, in years of less abundant
precipitation, it is restricted to the greater altitudes and occasional
hollows at 12,000 or 13,000 feet.            The area of the unusual fall was
very extensive.         It included Kumaou and Garhwal, Sirmoor, and a
portion of Bissahir, Kangra, and Hazara.                But in the valleys and
passes     to   the   north-east  and  south-east   of  Wangtu (in the Sutlej
valley)     the  fall  was small  as compared    with   former   years?”    So also
at Sultanpur and Plach in the Kulu valley, the fall was considered to
be below the average, and in Lahoul and Spiti it was unusually light.
In Chamba the fall was abnormally heavy on the <U+FB01>rst snowy range
between the Ravi and Chenab, but on the north-east of the range it
was light, and “the Pangi men complained that they had not had
 enough snow.”1'         In Hazara, the Deputy Commissioner reported that
 “the snowfall is unprecedented since 1877 (the winter previous to the
scarcity of 1877—78) ;” and Colonel Sir Oliver St. John, writing from
J amu on the 28th February, informed me “ there was a heavy fall of
snow in the Kashmir valley, and over the Pir Punjal range at the end
of last month, but         I do not learn that it was anything out of the
common.” Also Mr. Ney Elias, writing from Leh, states that “last
winter was a very open one in Ladak, and both ranges and valleys
were unusually lightly covered till the beginning of May.”
    These reports show that the abnormal snowfall was restricted to
the outer Himalaya and the <U+FB01>rst snowy range ; but over this region it
was very thick and lasting. During the latter part of January and in
 February and March, the weather over a great part of Northern
 India was exceptionally cold. But the temperature rose in April,
and May was a hot and remarkably dry month up to the 21st.                      The
 dryness was greatest on the North-Western Himalaya; the relative

humidity of the air at Chakatra         on the 19th and 20th, at 10 A.M.,
being     only 8 per  cent. of saturation (according to the telegraphic
report), or 45 per     cent. below the general average of the month of
May. Great heat       and dryness prevailed also with the westerly winds
over the whole of     extra-tropical India, with the exception of Bengal
and Assam.
     In Ladak, however, very bad weather set in in the beginning of
May, and lasted nearly a month. This thickened the snows, and for
a time brought the snow-line down to about the ordinary March level.
In the last week in May the weather again became clouded over
Northern India and the outer Himalaya ; the temperature fell, and on
the 28th and 29th another heavy fall of snow took place on the
mountains, whitening their sides down to 10,000 or 11,000 feet.
     In was under these circumstances that the following notes were

 published in the “Gazette of India           (2nd June).     The <U+FB01>rst was
 written    on the 18th  May,  when  the  dryness of the  air  was about at
 its maximum, and a day or two before the change set in that culmi
 nated in the snowfall of the 28th and 29th May.           The second was
 written on the 3lst May, immediately after the fall.
     I. “ That the unusually dry weather now prevailing over the
 North-Western Himalaya, and that which, though less abnormal,
 characterises the whole of N orth-Western India at the present time,
 is an effect of the unusual accumulation of snow, is a conclusion
justi<U+FB01>ed by the experience of the last few years ; and were it not that
 the snow is rapidly decreasing under the unobstructed radiation of
 the sun, there might be some reason, judging from the present
 limited experience, to anticipate some retardation of the rains in the
 upper provinces, and possibly even in Western India generally.        But,
 on the other hand, the fact that during the months of April and May
 the atmospheric pressure over the greater part of the country has
  been below the normal average of the season, is one which                 .
  portends favourably for the timely in<U+FB02>ux of the monsoon.        In Bengal
  it may be said the prospects are wholly favourable.” -
      II. “ Since the above was written there has been heavy rain for
  many days on the outer hills, and more or less on the plains of
  the Punjab, and apparently a very heavy fall of snow on the higher
  ranges . . . .       If, therefore, the mountains of Lahoul, Spiti, and
  other more distant ranges have shared this fall, if it is as extensive as
  it is apparently heavy on the visible ranges, and if the views which
  the experience of recent years seem to justify, viz., that an unusual
  extent and thickness of snow on the Himalaya is productive of dry
   north-west and west winds in North-Western India are valid, we
   must be prepared for a long spell of dry weather and a retarded rain

   tana.   In Bengal the rains set on in the 13th, which is a day or two
  in advance of the average date, but they extended inland only as far
  as Behar, with a moderate fall up to Allahabad.        Further westward
  there were occasional thunderstorms, but no heavy rain fell before
  the 26th, nor in the Punjab before the 29th, and even then it was not
  continuous.    On the 2nd or 3rd July, in writing a summary of the
  weather of the previous month, Mr. Dallas remarks :—~“ In parts
  of the North-Western Provinces and the Punjab continuous rain has
  hardly yet set in."
      In Rajputana there was scarcely any rain in June, but the month
  was decidedly cool; and in Bombay and Gujarat also the tempera
  ture was below the average.      In Bombay the monsoon did not set in
  steadily before the  24th,  and the rainfall was light throughout the
  month.     This coincidence of de<U+FB01>cient rainfall, and a temperature
  below the average, is unusual.
     During the <U+FB01>rst half of July rain was frequent and heavy on the
  North-Western Himalaya; but, according to my own observations at
  Simla, this rainy period presented one or two noteworthy features.
  In the <U+FB01>rst place, thunderstorms were repeated day after day; and,
 secondly, the rain was frequently accompanied with hail.            These
 accompaniments are characteristic of the storms that precede the
 rains, and are exceptional in a rainy season of the normal character.
 As far as my experience goes, they indicate an unsteady monsoon or
 its approaching termination, and the existence of a dry current at no
 great elevation above the rain clouds. Certain it is, that at frequent
 intervals during this rainy period the existence of such a current was
 rendered evident by the drift from the north-west of small broken
 cloud tufts, or by the inclination and movement of the tops of the
 rain clouds, when the lower current was from some southerly direc
 tion, generally up-valley.
     About the 19th July the rains ceased, except for occasional thunder
 storms, and from that time to the end of August this north-west
 current held full sway, frequently down to the surface of the hills
 (7,000 feet), but more generally perhaps 2,000 or 3,000 feet higher. This
 same current prevailed also throughout the monsoon season of 1877,
and during the drought of August, 1880; and it is also characteristic
of the spring months. It appears to me to be the feeder of the
westerly and north-westerly winds (the land winds of North-Western
and Western India, as     I shall presently explain more at length).
     On the plains of the Punjab (except in the eastern districts,
between the 6th and 18th July) there was no continuous rain, but
heavy falls, for the most part very local, occurred at intervals up to
the 19th. After this date, up to the end of August, save on two days,
there was no fall amounting to 1 inch in any part of the province;
and the districts east and south of Ludhiana, and all to the west of

 Lahore and south of the salt range, were absolutely rainless. In
Rajputana there was no rain of any importance from- the 18th July to
the 29th August, and the absolutely rainless interval was from the
6th to the 17th August.       In the North-Western Provinces all the
western districts were rainless from the 26th July to the 20th August;
and in Oudh and the eastern districts, except in Mirzapur, there were
only rare and insigni<U+FB01>cant showers.        Still further east, in Behar,
showers were somewhat more frequent, but still only occasional, and
for the most part light. In Gujarat, Khandish, and Berar, the drought
 was equally great and prolonged; lasting from the 18th July to the
26th August, and at some stations up to the 31st.            And even in
Hyderabad and the Deccan there was no general rain, and but few
heavy showers locally, for the space of an entire month, from the
20th July. In the Konkan light showers fell daily up to the 7th
August; but even here and on the Ghats the rainfall was very light,
and the interval from the 8th to the 16th August was almost rainless.
   The extent of the drought was therefore very great, including the
whole of Western and North-Western and the greater part of Central
India. It began earlier and ended later in the Punjab and Northern
Bajputana than further to the south and east, and was most severe
during eight or ten days in the middle of August.       It affected. nearly
the whole of     the country   in which  the   land  winds prevail most
regularly and persistently during the spring months; and the winds
during the drought were identical in character and direction with
those which are normal in the spring season.
   During the period here dealt with, the barometric features, though
subject to considerable variation, were less anomalous than might
perhaps have been anticipated.      In April there had been, on the
whole, a slight excess of pressure above the average on the Punjab
Himalaya, about an average pressure on the plains of the greater part
of the province, and a slight de<U+FB01>ciency on the Gangetic plains and the
                          J
adjacent hills, from the amna eastwards, greater on the plains than
on the hills. In May, save in the north of the Bombay Presidency
during the <U+FB01>rst week, and generally on the last three or four days,
the pressure was below the average throughout Northern India,
the de<U+FB01>ciency averaging, 0n the mean of the whole month, ~—'O38"
on the North-Western Himalaya, 4'041” on the Punjab plains,
and —'056" on the Gangetic plain down to Benares.                   To the
south of the Ganges, in Central India, Rajputana, and the Central
Provinces, it was less, averaging from --‘020" to —‘O30". With the
snowfall at the end of May the pressure rose greatly above the
average both on the hills and plains, and so remained nearly a week.
About the 41th June it fell again, and remained unduly low over the
whole of Northern India till after the middle of the month. Between
the 18th and 20th, that is, a few days after the rains had set in

16        Mr. H.  F. Blanford.         0n   the Connexion      of  the    [May   1,
in Bengal, it again rose above the average, and except for another
fall on the 27th and 28th, just before the rain, it remained excessive
during the latter part of the month (save, indeed, in the Western
Punjab), the excess culminating 0n the 21st and 25th.                      On the
plains of the Western Punjab the temperature was very high; at
Rawalpindi, on some days, as much as 10° or 12° above the average
of the month; which fact probably explains the local anomaly of the
average pressure in that region.
    The high pressure thus established in the latter part of June lasted
in the Eastern Punjab and the North-Western Provinces, with but
slight intermission, throughout the <U+FB01>rst half of July, being very
excessive at the beginning and end of that period.               To the eastward
 in Bengal, and to the south-east and south in the Central Provinces
and Bombay, as well as in the Western Punjab, the oscillations were
similar in phase, but the average excess was either less pronounced
or altogether nulli<U+FB01>ed and reversed, the pressure being above the
average only for a few days at the beginning and after the 15th of the
month.    An abnormal excess of pressure relatively to the remainder
of Northern India was therefore existent in the Eastern Punjab and
the North-Western Provinces.
    In the latter part of the month, after the cessation of the rain,
 the pressure fell generally below the average in Northern India,
 and especially in the Punjab and North-Western Provinces, but
 the northern part of Bombay formed an exception to the rule.                     A
 great de<U+FB01>ciency of pressure both on the hills“ and plains characterized
also the <U+FB01>rst days of August, and on the plains and at the western
 most hill station, Murree, this was associated with an excessive
 temperature; but at Simla, Chakrata, and Ranikhet, the latter was
 more or less considerably below the average.                  After the 6th the
 pressure  rose again,  and   smaller    oscillations,  lasting   <U+FB01>ve or six days,
 followed   during  the    remainder      of   the   month.      In   the Punjab,
 the North-Western Provinces, and Bengal, the mean pressure of
 the month was slightly below the average of many years.                         In
 Rajputana,   Gujarat,  Sind,  and    Western      and‘ Central   India  generally,
 such was not the case, since in this region an excessive pressure
 prevailed throughout the middle of the month for seventeen or
 eighteen days after the 6th. This coincided with the period of the
 greatest and most extensive drought.
    At the hill stations the oscillations of pressure were similar to
 those on the plains, though less in amount.              At Simla and Murree
 the mean pressure of the two months, July and August, scarcely
 deviated from the normal average.            But at Leh in both months there
 was a decided de<U+FB01>ciency,      and    it  was but slightly less at Chakrata
 and Ranikhet.

    The barometric features of the season may then be summed up as
follows z—With local and more or less temporary exceptions the
pressure of the atmosphere over India was below the average
throughout the <U+FB01>rst eight months of the year, the greatest de
pression being in May, when it was universal in India. But this was
only the general average of a series of oscillations of pressure (some
what greater than usual at most stations in May, June, and July),
which succeeded each other throughout the period. These oscilla
tions were closely connected with great variations of temperature,
and were to some extent an effect of the latter, each fall of rain
 (or snow on the hills) being accompanied with a rise of pressure and
a temporary excess which speedily diminished, and was followed by
a fall below the average, with the return of dry, <U+FB01>ne weather.

indeed, the atmosphere is most frequently calm, 0r agitated only by
light movements of very variable direction,"E and especially so in the
winter months. But down the Gangetic plain (save in the neigh
bourhood of the hills), and on the plateau of Rajputana and Central
India, light and steady winds from between north-west and west are
those most characteristic of the whole of the dry season.               During the
winter months these winds are cooler, from March onwards warmer,
than those from the opposite quarters ; and in April and May they
constitute the well-known hot winds of Northern India.                      At both
seasons they are dry winds, and the striking change in their tempe
rature is due, as was long ago pointed out by Sir Joseph Hooker, to
that of the land surface swept by them. Pari pass-n with the rise of
 temperature they undergo certain partial changes of direction, and
 also in the region of their prevalence.         From November to February,
 when, as a rule, an axis of maximum pressure runs from the Punjab
 and Sind across Rajputana, Central India, and the Central Provinces
 towards Orissa, with lower pressures over the Gangetic valley and
 Bengal on the one hand, and over the peninsula, and especially on
 its south-west coast, on the other, the current of which they form
 part tends to circulate anticyclonically          around the ridge of high
 pressure     above  de<U+FB01>ned,  and  thus  the  directions    are northerly on the
 eastern portion of the Central          India   plateau and easterly to the
 south of the Satpura chain in Nagpur, the Deccan and Hyderabad.

 18       Mr. H. F. Blanford.      ()n the Connexion   of  the    [May 1,
Bellary    and Hyderabad plateau, which speedily extends to the
eastern   half  of the Central Provinces, Chutia, Nagpur, and the
 Gangetic plain, the winds, in accordance with the law of cyclonic cir
culation, become northerly or north-westerly in the Deccan, and the
 western half of the Central Provinces and Central India, and almost
due west on the plateau south of the Ganges and Jamna, and on the
plain along the course of those rivers. On the other hand, in accord
ance with the same cyclonic law, the winds of the east coast and
maritime plains of the peninsula and Bengal are chie<U+FB02>y from south ;
 and as the season advances, the current from the sea creeps up the
northern margin of the Gangetic plain as a south-east wind under
the lee of the hills and intermittently sweeping the crests of the
 outer Himalaya.
    This distribution of the winds explains that of the spring rains,
which fall, chie<U+FB02>y in thunderstorms, on the southern and eastern
districts of the peninsula and in Bengal; whereas, westward from
Nagpur, in the Deccan, Berar, Khandesh, Gujarat, and even the
 Konkan, Katywar, and Cutch, indeed the whole of Western India,
southwards to Belgaum and northwards to the con<U+FB01>nes of the
Punjab, the season from November to May is practically rainless.
This latter is the realm of the dry land winds, or, as regards the
coast, northerly long-shore winds; this being the local phase of the
general current, and equally unfavourable to precipitation.
    To one portion of this region, viz., Sind, Cutch, Katywar, and the
adjoining portion of Western Rajputana, the above description of the
winds is applicable only with some modi<U+FB01>cation.          In this part of
Western India, north-east is the prevailing direction from November
to February, and in the subsequent months south-west winds are
frequent even if they do not preponderate.      But these latter bring no
rain.   They appear to be an indraught from the coast, and as they
penetrate the country they coalesce with the general stream and
contribute their quota to the dry winds of Eastern Rajputana and
Gujarat.    They become merged and 10st in the prevailing current.
    The question then presents itself, “ What is the origin of the dry
westerly current ‘P The supposition that the indraught from the
south-west furnishes more than a small portion of the stream is at
Once negatived by the fact that, even at Knrrachee              and Bhuj,
southerly winds do not preponderate      over  northerly  until  May, and
even then almost inappreciably; at Rajkot, not before June; and
the very fact of the great dryness of the west and north-west winds
militates against the idea that any considerable portion of their air
mass can be drawn from the sea.       Neither is it derived to any con
siderable extent from the valleys and lower slopes of the surrounding
hills. There is no permanent drainage of air from these hill slopes,
and strong winds blowing outwards from the longer valleys, like the

  1884.]           Himalaya Snowfall with Drought in India.                        19
  ddclu of   Hurdwar, are local and exceptional phenomena, restricted to
  certain hours of the day. At all the hill stations of the outer North
  West Himalaya, as far as the existing registers show, southerly winds
  preponderate over northerly, all through the year; and although this
  is probably due in some measure to the fact that the night winds
  have    not hitherto been registered, it su<U+FB01>ices to show that up to a
  level of 7,000 feet there is no steady out<U+FB02>ow of air from the hills to
  the plains.
      There remains then only the supposition that these winds are fed
  by the descent of air from an upper stratum, viz., from a current
  moving at a considerable elevation from west to east.               And that this
  is their true explanation several facts seem to testify.               In the <U+FB01>rst
  place, they     are  characteristically    winds   of the day  time,   their move
  ment being at a minimum (almost or quite a calm) in the morning
  hours, and indeed up to 9 or 10 o’clock in the forenoon;                      then
  increasing with the temperature and falling again towards evening;
  and, secondly, such observations as have been made on the decrease
  of temperature with elevation, show that, in the dry weather, the
  vertical decrement is such as is incompatible with the vertical
  equilibrium of an air column, being considerably more than 1° in
  183 feet.      The diurnal variation of the movement is then probably to
  be accounted for on Koppen’s hypothesis, viz., the interchange of the
  higher and lower air strata by convective movements, which do not
  aifect the existing horizontal movement of the higher atmosphere, so
  that the air of the latter, after its descent, preserves for a time its
  original eastward motion.           The hypothesis of convective interchange
  receives further support from the character of the diurnal variation
  curve of vapour tension in a dry atmosphere near the earth’s
  surface, which is the same in all parts of India.            This shows a rapid
  fall of the absolute humidity of the air after 8 or 9 o’clock in the
  forenoon, reaching its minimum about the time of greatest heat, and
  a more or less sudden rise before sunset which it is dif<U+FB01>cult to
  account for on any other supposition than that it coincides          ‘
                                                                            with the
  cessation of the convective movement.*
      Systematic observations on the movement of the clouds, and more
/
  especially the higher clouds in the upper provinces during the dry
  season, are unfortunately          as yet wanting, but according to such
  casual observations as        I  have myself made when on inspection tours
  in the cold season and during the spring months or hot season at
  Simla, go to show that the movement is generally, if not always,
  from some westerly quarter, and most frequently from the north
  west.
     * See, for instance, Plates II, VIII, and XXVI of vol. i of these memoirs.   The
  curves of Yarkhand and Allahabad show that this type of variation is characteristic
  of the months in which the range of temperature is greatest.

    The North- West Winds after Winter Rainfall—A phenomenon which
almost invariably follows a fall of rain and snow on the North-Western
 Himalaya in the winter and early spring months, and which has
been repeatedly described in the Annual Reports on the Meteorology
of India)“ is a wave of high pressure advancing eastward from the
valley of the Indus, accompanied with steady cool north-west winds
on the plains.       Charts illustrating this phenomenon have been given
in several of the Annual Reports on the Meteorology of India, from
          I
which select that of February 26th, 1881, as a very characteristic
example (<U+FB01>g. 1). At this season, the snow falls at comparatively
low levels (occasionally, though rarely, as in the present year, to
below 2,000 feet), and below the snow limit'the ln'll slopes and
valleys are cooled by the rainfall.
    In these cases it can'hardly be questioned that the north-west
wind is simply an out<U+FB02>ow of cold air from the hills, the high density
of which is the chief cause of the rise of the barometer.                    On the
plains,   in  the neighbourhood of the hills, it rarely lasts more than a
few days; not longer indeed than it requires to melt the low lying
snow and to evaporate the fallen rain, but the phenomenon is of
great interest in the bearing that it has on the main topic of this
paper, affording an illustration at a low level of that which                 I con
ceive to operate at a high level on a more lasting and extended
scale, later on in the season.
                             Summary and Conclusion.
    The principal facts and conclusions set forth in this paper are as
follows :—
    1st. The experience of recent years affords many instances of an
unusually heavy and especially a late fall of snow on the North
Western Himalaya being followed by a prolonged period of drought
on the plains of North-Western and Western India.
    2nd. On tabulating the average rainfall of the winter and spring
months at the stations of the N orth-Western Himalaya, year by year,
for the last eighteen years, and comparing it with the average rain
fall of the North-Western Provinces in the ensuing summer mon
soon, it is found that with four exceptions an excessive winter pre
cipitation on the hills is followed by a de<U+FB01>cient summer rainfall on
the plains, and vice versti.       Of the four apparent exceptions, two are
found to a<U+FB01>ord a striking support to the <U+FB01>rst proposition.
    3rd. The west winds which, in Western and Northern India, are
characteristic of seasons of drought as abnormal winds, are identical
in character with the normal winds of the dry season, and appear to

   41th. It is a common and well-known phenomenon of the Winter
months that a fall of rain and snow on the North-Western Himalaya
is immediately followed by a wave of high pressure advancing east
wards from the western mountains, accompanied with dry cool north

   5th. The conclusion is that an unusual expanse of snow on the
Nerth-Western Himalaya, whether due to the unmelted residue of an
unusually copious winter snowfall, or to an unusually late fall in the
spring months, acts, at high levels, in the summer months, in some
what the same way as the ordinary falls of snow and rain on the
Lower Himalaya do at low levels in the winter season, and favours

   6th. That this dependence of dry winds on the Himalayan snow
fall a<U+FB01>ords a criterion for forecasting the probabilities of drought in
North-Western and Western India.
     In setting forth the   above conclusions,     it   is,
                                                however, necessary not
to ignore the fact that there other conditions besides those here
considered which exercise very great in<U+FB02>uence on the prevalence of
                                  a

years  1876 and  1877  in
                       ;   the former year in Southern India, in the
latter in the North-Western Provinces and Rajputana), the pressure
of the atmosphere was persistently and abnormally high, and this was
due, as  Ishowed in the reports on the meteorology of those years, to
the condition, probably the high density, of the higher atmospheric
strata. Moreover this excessive pressure was shown to a<U+FB01>ect so
extensive a region, that     would be unreasonable to attribute
                             it                                       to   it
the condition of any tract so limited as a portion of the Himalayan
chain; and     dependent on the thermal conditions of the surface,
              if
which may indeed have been the case, this land must rather have
been the major portion of the Asiatic continent than merely a rela
tively small portion of its mountain axis. This question must remain
for future inquiry. It      referred to here to guard against too wide
                             is
an application being assigned to the action of the Himalayan
snows.

         Report to the Solar Physics Committee on a Comparison
       between apparent Inequalities of Short Period in Sun
       Spot Areas and in Diurnal Temperature-Ranges at Toronto
       and at Kew.” By BALFOUR STEWART, M.A., LL.D., F.R.S.,
       and WILLIAM LANT CARPENTER, B.A., B.Sc.       Communi
       cated to the Royal Society at the request of the Solar
       Physics Committee. Received April 21, 1884.
                                      (Abstract)
  It has been known for some time that there          a close connexion
                                                              is
between the inequalities in the state of the sun’s surface as denoted
by sun-spot areas and those in terrestrial magnetism as denoted by
the diurnal ranges of oscillation of the declination magnet; and
moreover the observations of various meteorologists have induced us
to suspect that there may likewise be a connexion between solar
Inequalities and those in terrestrial meteorology.
   This latter connexion, however (assuming      to exist),
                                                         it   not so well
                                                                    is

1884.]     Sun-spot Areas and    Diurnal   Temperature-Ranges.          23
established as the former, at least if we compare together Inequal
ities of long period. It has been attempted to explain this by
imagining that for long periods the state of the atmosphere as regards
absorption may change in such a manner as to cloak or diminish the
e<U+FB01>ects of solar variation by increasing absorption when the sun is
strongest and diminishing absorption when the sun is weakest.
    On this account it seemed desirable to the authors to make a com
parison of this kind between short-period Inequalities, since for
these the length of period could not so easily be deemed su<U+FB01>icient to
produce a great alteration of the above nature in the state of the
atmosphere.
    The meteorological element selected for comparison with sun-spots
was the diurnal range of atmospheric temperature, an element which
presents in its variations a very strong analogy to diurnal declination
ranges.
    There are two ways in which a comparison may be made between
solar and terrestrial Inequalities.       We may take each individual
oscillation in sun-spot areas, and <U+FB01>nd the value of the terrestrial
element corresponding in time to the maximum and the minimum
of the solar wave. If we were to perform this operation for every
 individual solar Inequality, and add together the results, we might
probably <U+FB01>nd that the magnetic declination-range was largest when
 there were most sun-spots. If, however, we were to make a similar
comparison between sun-spot daily areas and diurnal temperature
ranges we might not obtain a decisive result.              For at certain
 stations, such as Toronto, it is suspected (the veri<U+FB01>cation or disproval
 of this suspicion being one of the objects of this paper) that there
 are two maxima and two minima of temperature-range for one of
 sun-spots.    The e<U+FB02>'ect of this might be that in such a comparison
 the temperature-range corresponding to a maximum of sun-spots
 might be equal in value to that corresponding to a minimum, or, in
 other words, we should get no apparent result, while, however, by
 some other process proofs of a real connexiOn might be obtained.
  But if we can get evidences of apparent periodicity in sun-spot <U+FB02>uc
  tuations when dealt with in a particular manner, we have at once
  a method which will aiford us a de<U+FB01>nite means of comparison.         And
  here, as Professor  Stokes has  pointed out, it is not necessary for  our
 present purpose to discuss the question whether these sun-spot
  Inequalities have a real or only an apparent periodicity.       All that
 is needful is to treat the terrestrial phenomena in a similar manner,
  or in a manner as nearly similar as the observations will allow, and
  then see whether they also exhibit periodicities (apparent or real)
  having virtually the same times as those of sun-spots, the phases of
  the two sets of phenomena being likewise allied to one another in a
  constant manner.

    It is such a comparison that the authors have made, their method
of analysis being one which enables them to detect the existence of
unknown Inequalities having apparent periodicity in a mass of obser
vations. A description of this method has already been published in
 the “Proceedings of the Royal Society” for May 15th, 1879.            The
comparison    was  made  by this   method  between   sun-spot observations
extending from 1832 to 1867 inclusive, Toronto temperature-range
observations extending from 1844 to 1879 inclusive, and Kew tempe
rature-range observations extending from 1856 to 1879 inclusive.
 The following conclusions were obtained from this comparison.
    (1.) Sun-spot Inequalities      around 241 and 26 days, whether
apparent or real, seem to have periods very nearly the same as those
of terrestrial meteorological Inequalities as exhibited by the daily
temperature-ranges at Toronto and at Kew.
    (2.) While the sun-spots and the Kew temperature-range Inequal
ities present evidence of a single oscillation, the corresponding
Toronto temperature-range Inequalities present evidence of a double
oscillation.
    (3.) Setting the celestial and terrestrial members of each indi
vidual Inequality, so as to start together from the same absolute
time, it is found that the solar maximum occurs about 8 or 9 days
after one of the Toronto maxima, and the Kew temperature-range
maximum about 7 days after the same Toronto maximum.
    (4.) The proportional oscillation exhibited by the temperature
range Inequalities is much less than the proportional oscillation
exhibited by the corresponding solar Inequalities.

    Whilst makinga series of experiments on the “self-deposition of
metals,”    I observed, by trying a number of di<U+FB01>erent metals, that
several of them received an electrolytic deposit of cadmium by
contact with cadmium in various solutions of that metal much more
frequently than others;      I   therefore made various experiments to
determine whether this was due to difference of density of current or
to other causes.
   By means of these additional trials,        I   found, on passing an
undivided current through a series of portions of the same metallic
solution, that cathodes composed of diiferent metals of equal amounts
of immersed surface, required currents of different degrees of density
to cause deposits of the same metal upon them, and that the
di<U+FB01>erences in some cases were considerable.          Another singular cir

       Prof. FREDERICK GUTHRIE, F.R.S.             Received April 23,
       1884.
    The magnitude and direction of the Thomson       e<U+FB01>'eot depend upon
a coef<U+FB01>cient which is always the same for the same metal, but varies
with different metals.    Professor Everett, in his “ Units and Physical
 Constants,” p. 151, gives a table based upon Tait’s thermoelectric
 diagram (“ Trans. R.S.E.,” vol. xxvii, p. 125), in which the thermo
 electric values of a number of metals, referred to lead as zero, are
given in the form art-<U+FB01>t, where [3 is a number which for a given
metal is proportional to the tangent of the inclination of the line
representing the metal in Tait’s diagram, and therefore to the co
 ef<U+FB01>cient of the Thomson e<U+FB02>'ect.
    Since all the physical properties of a metal are to some extent
 affected by heat, it seemed probable that a connexion might be found
 to exist between certain of these properties and the Thomson effect.
A short examination showed that, as‘a rule, the coef<U+FB01>cient of the
 Thomson effect is positive in those metals which have a great speci<U+FB01>c
electrical resistance and speci<U+FB01>c heat, and negative in those which
are distinguished by a great coef<U+FB01>cient of expansion.         I therefore
made several attempts to ascertain whether the Thomson coef<U+FB01>cient
might not be some de<U+FB01>nite function of the speci<U+FB01>c resistance, speci<U+FB01>c
heat, and coef<U+FB01>cient of expansion; and though I have not been per
fectly successful, it appears from the subjoined table that there is a

  The <U+FB01>rst column contains the names of all the metals given in
Everett’s table, with the exception of alloys.
  The second column gives the numerical coe<U+FB02>icients of t in-Everett's
table; these numbers are proportional to the coef<U+FB01>cients of the
Thomson e<U+FB01>ect.
    The speci<U+FB01>c heats in the third column are Regnault’s determi
nations, as given in Pickering’s “ Physical Manipulation,” vol.                      ii,
p. 287.
   The speci<U+FB01>c resistances in column IV (except that of tin) [are

“ Physical Manipulation.” The resistance of tin         reduced from

   The <U+FB01>fth column contains the products of the third and fourth
multiplied by 106 to get rid of decimals.
   The coef<U+FB01>cients of expansion in the sixth column are taken from
the “Encyclopaedia Britannica,” 9th edition, article “Heat,” by Sir
William Thomson.        The authorities   are given in the seventh
column?“
   The eighth column gives the squares of the coe<U+FB01>icients of expansion
divided by 343.?
   The numbers in the ninth column are obtained by subtracting
those in the eighth from those in the <U+FB01>fth column.
   In the last column the numbers in column IX are divided by
2,400.
    It   will   be seen that,   with   one exception, the order of magnitude         of
the numbers in column  IX (proportional to spec. heat X spec. res. 106           X

rate of decrease in column X is, however, not the same as that in
column II, the numbers diminishing too rapidly in the upper half of
the column and too slowly in the lower half. Although, therefore,                    it
appears very probable that the direction and magnitude of the
    ""Where more than one value was given the <U+FB01>rst was always used except in the
cases of silver and zinc.      The expansions for silver are—Muschenbrock’s, 2120;

                         ;            2918.   In both cases there is   a fair agreement
between the second and third values, While the <U+FB01>rst differs from them considerably.
The second values give silver and zinc the same places in column X as in
column     II  the <U+FB01>rst would change their order.

in column IX should be as nearly as possible equal to the ratio of the <U+FB01>rst number
to the last in column II, the number corresponding to lead in column IX should at
the same time be as near zero as possible.          Both conditions could not be exactly
ful<U+FB01>lled at once.

II.     “Experimental Research on the Electromotive Force from
         Difference of Potential during Diffusion in Tidal Streams.”
         By THOMAS ANDREWS, F.R.S.E., Assoc. M. Inst. O.E.,
         Wortley Iron Works, near Shef<U+FB01>eld. Communicated by
         Professor STOKES, Sec. R.S. Received April 20, 1884.
   An examination of the composition of the waters throughout the
length of a tidal stream during di<U+FB01>usion of salt and fresh water
consequent on tidal action, reveals a very considerable di<U+FB02>erence
in the proportion of saline constituents between the water at the
surface and that at the bottom, during certain times of tide this
difference amounting sometimes to near 100 per cent., and it may
frequently be either much greater or less according to tidal <U+FB02>uctua
tions.
   This fact constitutes the basis of the investigation which the author
undertook, to obtain some approximate quantitative measurement of
the resultant electromotive force, 820., arising from such di<U+FB01>'erence of
potential.   It is known that a current is set up when a bar or plate of
the same metal is immersed in two dissimilar solutions in contact,
one capable of acting readily upon the metal, the other having little
or no action on        it,
                     the whole forming     circuit.

unfrequently be observed arising from the previous unequal action of
the solutions on the metal.
   The series of groups of metals employed in this investigation, viz.,
wrought irons, various steels, and cast metals, &c., were especially
selected in order to render the research of more practical value.
   The two dissimilar solutions used were sea water (from Filey Bay)
and distilled water.
   The author devised the arrangement described below for carrying
out this research.
   The experiments were made on large round bars of each of the
following metals, of known chemical composition and speci<U+FB01>c gravity,
every bar was 2%% inches diameter, carefully turned and polished
quite bright, the metals being each especially prepared throughout
for these observations.
   A careful selection was made with reference to the percentage of
combined carbon, specimens containing the highest and lowest being
taken, in order that extreme results in each case might be arrived at.
The descriptive terms “ soft ” and “ hard ” have reference solely to
percentages of combined carbon.
   This large size and round form of bar were employed to ensure in
the manipulation of the metals as uniform a molecular structure as
practicable.
   The steel and iron bars in each case were prepared from the same
ingot or bloom and sawn into equal lengths when <U+FB01>nished, so that
the bars of the same metal (turned and <U+FB01>nished) were identically of
one composition, &c.      The same exact care was exercised in the
preparation  of the cast metal bars.

 30           Mr. T. Andrews.      Electromotive Force from      [May 8,
                         Method of Experimentation.
    The experiments were conducted as follows, in precisely the same
 manner in each case for comparison.
    For the purposes of this research the cells were constructed so that
 the di<U+FB01>usion     e<U+FB01>ects,  electromotive force, &c., observed should
 approximate to those obtaining during a tidal period of six hours.
    A strong wooden box was divided into two equal compartments, A
 and B, the partition containing at the lower end a porous diaphragm
 of chamois leather to allow of a suitable di<U+FB01>usion between the
 solutions.
    Two bars from the same piece of metal (of precisely the same
 composition), polished bright, and exactly 25—} inches diameter, were
 placed in the cells exactly at equal distances apart in each case (139;
 inch), one bar in partition A, and the other bar in partition B, the
 bars being attached to the galvanometer No. 1. The partitions A
 and B were then simultaneously carefully <U+FB01>lled up to a depth of 12
inches, the one with sea water, the other with distilled water, and
 careful telescopic readings taken of the time changes in the de<U+FB02>ections
 of the galvanometer No. I, regularly during the tidal period of six
 hours.
    The di<U+FB01>erence in level between the solutions in the cells, caused by
 the greater speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the sea water, assisted di<U+FB02>'usion, thus
approximating to the current pressures in rivers exerted by the tidal
<U+FB02>ow.                                    .
   To render the application of these experiments as practical as
possible, the observations of the electromotive force and time changes
of resistance during di<U+FB02>'usion, were taken at regular intervals of two
and a half minutes (the results being summarised in Table B), over
tidal periods of six hours, so as to afford an approximation to the
e<U+FB01>ects produced by alternating diffusion of salt and fresh water
during the tidal changes of a tidal river.
   The galvanometer No. 1 with its accessories, resistance coils, &c.,
employed in these experiments was a delicate astatic one (by Messrs.
Elliott Bros), suspended needles, large mirrored dial, and it was also
arranged to work as a mirror galvanometer (R. of galvanometer 521
ohms at 20° 0.).
   It was constructed as to resistance, due, specially to suit the
purpose of this research.
   The galvanometer was carefully calibrated throughout, on the spot,
at the commencement of the research with a Daniell’s cell in circuit,
and the constancy of the instrument afterwards frequently veri<U+FB01>ed.
   Another astatic galvanometer, No. 2 (suspended needles), of lower
resistance was used for taking the time changes in the resistance of
the cells, by the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB02>ing method as described further on.

     The results of the observations giving the E.M.F., &c., during
  diffusion are recorded in the summary of results on Table B, the
  E.M.F. being calculated from the ascertained resistances in circuit, in
 conjunction with the known calibration of the galvanometer No. 1,
 which was used for this part of the research.              _
     For ascertaining the comparative behaviour of the various metals‘
 employed, the author has given the average, together with the highest
           noted during the observations in each case.
                     Determination of Resistance of Cells.
     Di<U+FB01>iculties  were   experienced in determining the resistance in the
 cells which was momentarily such an inconstant quantity, owing to
 diffusion between the two solutions, and the dif<U+FB01>culty was further
 increased by polarisation when the Daniell’s cell was connected.

     After conferring with Professor . V. Jones, B.Sc., B.A., recourse
 was had in separate experiments to the method of rapidly alternating
 the direction of the current sent through the cells       being <U+FB01>rst sent
 in the direction of the current from those cells, then reversed), and
 reading from the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB02>ing of the galvanometer No. 2 by the aid of
a reading telescope.                                     -
    The time changes in the resistance of the diffusing solutions
ascertained by this <U+FB01>rst <U+FB02>ing method, are shown in the curve of
resistance, <U+FB01>g. No. 1, which is constructed from the average of a
series of six carefully repeated experiments, each extending over the
tidal period of six hours. The highest resistance of the cells at the
commencement was found to be 24.3 ohms, gradually reducing with a
steady curve to 12 ohms at the termination of each experiment. This
resistance curve, <U+FB01>g. No. 1, is the result of above 4,300 observations.
This <U+FB01>rst <U+FB02>ing method with a Daniell’s element in circuit was used
only for taking the rapidly changing resistance of the cells.
                               General Remarks.
    A   circumstance of interest in connexion with this research is
the    change    of electro-chemical position which not unfrequently
happened.
    Another noticeable feature was the electro-chemical position
maintained by the wrought iron bar (covered with its blue magnetic
oxide) immersed in the sea water, this bar being in the negative
position throughout ; repeated experiments con<U+FB01>rmed this.
    Also when the bars were removed from the solutions at the close
of an experiment, the different manner in which the metals had been
acted upon in the respective cells was decidedly noticeable.
    From an examination of the results (taking the highest and the
average               it will be seen in what comparative manner the
metals arranged themselves under the conditions of the experiment.

34                  Electromotive    Force in Tidal Streams.                [May 8,
    Twelve accurate curves of the electromotive force (each the result
of ninety-one observations) were obtained, showing the effect of this
tidal action on the various groups of metals under observation. The
 general contour and character of these a<U+FB01>ords interesting information
respecting such action on the di<U+FB02>z'erent metals employed. For
brevity, however, the results are abridged and summarised in one
Table, B.
    The highest               was rapidly reached, and generally from this
point to the end of a tidal period of six hours, a regular reduction of
E.M.F. ensued.          In every instance the greatest electromotive force
 was observed from the tidal action on the “ hard steels.
                                                              ”
    The “soft” steels affording on the averages less E.M.F. than the
rolled wrought iron, but this group of steels generally gave a higher
            near the commencement of each experiment.
    The rolled wrought iron gave more                        than the hammered
wrought iron, which latter, together with cast metal No. 2, gave the
least E.M.F. in these observations.
   The preceding results give a quantitative measurement of the
electromotive force under the conditions stated, and hence afford an
indication of the extent of similar action on structural ironwork in
tidal rivers during diffusion between the surface and lower waters, the
electromotive force observed being not only appreciable, but in many
instances very considerable, reaching not unfrequently the one-tenth
to the one-seventh     of a volt.

    This destructive action would appear to be exerted most extensively
 on the lower portion of iron or steel vessels, metallic structures, &c.,

because   such portion is shown by this research to be in the electro
positive position during certain conditions of.a tidal stream.
   It should be pointed out that similar conditions of galvanic action
obtain in all our iron structures in tidal estuaries or rivers, the action
of the salt and fresh water in course of diifusion constituting a source
of galvanic disintegration independent of any difference in composi
tion of the metals. It should also be observed that in circumstances
where the electromotive force arising from causes here pointed out
acts in concert with any E.M.F. from di<U+FB01>erences of composition of the
metals employed in structures, a very considerable total electrolytic
disintegration is likely to ensue.    From data kindly furnished to the
author by Dr. H. Clifton Sorby, F.R.S., an indication is a<U+FB02>r'orded of
the nature of the changing composition of the waters of tidal
estuaries at various places and depths.      The Table B of electromotive
force, 800., together with the di<U+FB01>usion resistance curve (<U+FB01>g. No. 1),
afford some index of the changing E.M.F. arising from such tidal
di<U+FB01>erence of potential.
   In approaching the subject in the manner stated in this memoir,
the author trusts he has been able to a<U+FB01>ord some indication of the
extent of the electromotive force from the action of tidal streams on
the various metals experimented upon.
III.  “ On Unequal Electric Conduction-Resistance at Cathodes.”
       By G. GORE, F.R.S., LL.D. Received April 30, 1884.
   During    some   experiments which      I  have been making on the
unequal resistance     to  the deposition of a metal upon cathodes of
di<U+FB01>erent metals in the same solution by the same current (see
“Some New Phenomena of Electrolysis”),              I  have been led to
investigate   the  resistance  of  cathodes   of di<U+FB01>erent  metals to the
passage of the current into them.
   I  have found that by taking a good conducting electrolyte,
immersing in it a positive sheet of zinc, and a smaller negative one of
another metal, connecting the plates with a galvanometer of low
resistance, reducing all the other resistances in the circuit to the
minimum except that of the negative plate; then making a series of
measurements of strengths of current of ditierent couples formed by
the zinc and about twelve other metals, during removal of polarisation
by stirring the liquid; also making another series of measurements of
the electromotive forces of the same couples during stirring; calcu
lating from these data the total resistance in each case, then
 deducting the portion of resistance due to the galvanometer, also that
 due to the liquid itself, and to opposing contact-potential, and

  thermo-electric and voltaic action at the cathode           and external
  junction, very di<U+FB01>erent-amounts      of resistance, large in some cases,
  remain, and are exercised by different metals as cathodes, and those
  di<U+FB01>’erences of resistance are only to a small extent due to heat and
  current absorbed in liberating hydrogen, and can only in a few cases
  be partly accounted for by chemical action, <U+FB01>lms, or absorption of
  gases at the cathode.
     I  am now investigating the nature of this resistance, and the
  relations of the resistance to various circumstances.

        the Amount of Light re<U+FB02>ected by Metallic Surfaces. III.”
        By Sir JOHN CONROY, Bart, M.A. Communicated by Pro
        fessor G. G. STOKES, Sec. R.S.        Received May    6, 1884.
    Professor Stokes recently communicated to the Royal Society
(“ Proc. Roy. 800.,” vol. 36, p. 187) an account of some determina
tions    I  had made of the amount of light re<U+FB02>ected by steel and
speculum metal mirrors when polarised light was incident upon
 them.
    I have repeated these experiments with <U+FB01>lms of silver chemically
deposited on glass. as such <U+FB01>lms approximate more closely to
theoretically perfect metallic surfaces than any metallic           mirror,
however carefully polished, and also because very diiferent state
ments have been made as to the re<U+FB02>ective power of such <U+FB01>lms; one
observer having said that silvered glass mirrors re<U+FB02>ect about 90
per cent. of the light incident upon them, whilst another made their
re<U+FB02>ective power only equal to that of speculum metal.

 1884.]         Some Erperiments on llletallic Re<U+FB02>ection.              57
   I had hoped to have made some observations         of the amount of
light re<U+FB02>ected by <U+FB01>lms of di<U+FB01>erent thicknesses, which    I had proposed
to obtain in the same way as those used in the experiments of which
an account was given in the “ Proc. Roy. Soc,” vol. 31, p. 486, but
after numerous trials, extending over a period of nearly two months,
failed to obtain any suitable <U+FB01>lms.
   Although the same process was used (Martins, “Ann. de Chim.,”
4th series, vol. xv, p. 94) the silvered surfaces were never perfectly
bright when removed from the solution, as had been the case with
those prepared for the experiments already referred to.             A few
minutes’ rubbing with a chamois leather was su<U+FB02>icient to render the
mirrors perfectly bright, but the thin deposits of silver obtained by
removing the glass plates from the solution before the action is at an
end, are not suf<U+FB01>ciently coherent to withstand the necessary amount
of friction.
   The <U+FB01>rst    set of  photometric determinations were made with a
silver <U+FB01>lm deposited on a <U+FB02>at and well-polished glass plate 765
millims. long and 51 millims. wide; after being rubbed with a piece
of chamois leather the surface was perfectly bright, and when com
pared with the speculum metal mirror in the way suggested by
Professor Stokes (“Proc. Roy. Soc,” vol. 35, p. 36) the silvered
surface appeared slightly the best of the two.
   The glass plate was weighed before and after being coated with
silver, and the weight of the <U+FB01>lm was found to be 000135 grm. ; assuming
the density of the silver to be 1062, that being the value for silver
                                           “ Watts’s
<U+FB01>nely divided by precipitation given in              Dictionary,” vol. v,
p. 277, the thickness of the <U+FB01>lm calculated from the area and weight
was 0'00008447 millim., or about the same as the thickest of the
<U+FB01>lms used in the experiments already referred to.
   The <U+FB01>lm appeared opaque by ordinary daylight, but when examined
with sunlight was seen to be slightly transparent and of a deep blue
                                                                  '
colour.
   The photometrical determinations were made in exactly the same
way as those with the speculum metal and steel mirrors (“ Proc. Roy_
Soc,” vol. 36, p. 187), and the observations were about as concordant
as those contained in the Tables I and       II of the paper giving an
account of the experiments.
   Two complete series of observations were made with light
polarised in, and perpendicularly to, the plane of incidence, and the
results are given in Tables   I and II.
   The angles    of incidence   are given in the <U+FB01>rst column, the per
centage amount of light re<U+FB02>ected in the second and third, the means
of the two sets of observations in the fourth, and the amount of light
which ought to have been re<U+FB02>ected according to Cauchy’s formula; in

plane of incidence agree very fairly, the calculated values being
 slightly the lowest.
    For light polarised perpendicularly to the plane there is consider
 able di<U+FB01>erence between the two sets of numbers, the calculated
 values being considerably the highest.
    As has already been stated the silver <U+FB01>lm was, to some extent at
 least, transparent, and it was found that when a Nicol was held
 between the eye and the silvered glass, and sunlight was incident
 obliquely upon the <U+FB01>lm, the brightness and colour of the transmitted
 light varied with the position of the Nicol; the image of the sun
 being brightest when the short diagonal of the Nicol was in the plane
'of incidence, and darkest, and of a deep blue colour, when the
 long diagonal was in that plane. Hence it would appear that at
 oblique incidences light which is polarised perpendicularly to the
plane of incidence penetrates to a greater depth in the <U+FB01>lm than that
polarised in the plane, a result that is in accordance with the con
clusion drawn from the experiments with silver <U+FB01>lms already-referred
to, and one that may account for the difference in the observed and
calculated intensities of light polarised perpendicularly to the plane
of incidence re<U+FB02>ected by the silver <U+FB01>lm.*
    In order to ascertain whether the difference between the observed
and calculated results was really due to this cause or not, a thicker
<U+FB01>lm was prepared by depositing a second coating of silver on a
freshly-prepared <U+FB01>lm.
   The same glass plate was used; the silver weighed 0'0072 grm., and

         F.R.S. Received May 8, 1884.
     At the beginning of the <U+FB01>rst paper on this subject, which had the                  I
 honour of reading before the Fellows of the Royal Society now some
 what more than eight years ago (“ Proc. Roy. Soc,” vol. 24., p. 354),
 I  gave a short account of what appeared to me to be a rational mode
 of explaining the occurrence of all great explosions in dry and dusty
 collieries; and since then             I have had opportunities of studying several
 remarkable instances of this class of phenomena, with the result that
 I  am now more than ever satis<U+FB01>ed with the correctness of the views
 which        I then expressed.             It is true, as some subsequent writers,
 amongst whom              I    may name Sir Frederick Abel, F.R.S., have
 observed, that coal-dust had been previously recognised as a factor in
    *l‘ The value of  12  for steel at an angle of 50° is     416° 14’, and  not 42° 09’, as given
 in  the table on p. 196, an error for which,       I regret   to say,  I am   responsible.

 colliery explosions.         I  think   I   may safely claim, however, that no
 earlier author had gone the length of crediting it with the mile of
 principal agent, and relegating <U+FB01>re-damp to a secondary position.
                               I
     It is also admitted, believe, by everyone familiar with the subject,
 that my experiments with mixtures of coal-dust and air containing a
 small proportion of <U+FB01>re-damp were original.                  Similar experiments
 were subsequently made by members of the North of England
 Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers} by a committee of
 the Chester<U+FB01>eld Institute of Engineers<U+FB02>' by Professor Abel on behalf
 of the Home O<U+FB02>ice and the Royal Commission on Accidents in
 MinesJ; and by others in this country,§ by MM. Mallard and Le
 Chatelier for the Commission du Grisou in France," and by others on
 the Continent, all of which led to the same conclusion, namely, that
 air containing too small a proportion of <U+FB01>re-damp to render it in<U+FB02>am
 mable at ordinary pressure and temperature becomes so when coal
 dust is added to it. Differences of opinion were expressed as to the
 actual proportion of <U+FB01>re-damp, the comparative <U+FB01>neness of the coal
 dust, and the quality of the coal necessary to the attainment of this
 result, but the general conclusion, in every case, was the one                I have
 stated above.
                                                     I
     In my <U+FB01>rst paper, already referred to, had said: “ If it could be
 shown, therefore, that a mixture of air and coal-dust is in<U+FB02>ammable
 at ordinary pressure and temperature, there could be no dif<U+FB01>culty in
 accounting for the extent and violence of many explosions which

 44                      Mr. \V. Galloway.         On the           [May 15,
 great explosions it was found that the <U+FB02>ame had passed through
 very long galleries, containing presumably nothing but pure air, and
 of course dry coal-dust in a state of greater or less purity; and,
 secondly, it was impossible to account for certain other explosions,
 except on the supposition that they had been originated by the <U+FB01>ring
 of a shot in pure air in galleries containing dry coal-dust as in the
 last case. To have proved that a mixture of air, coal-dust, and <U+FB01>re
damp is in<U+FB02>ammable did not appear to me fully to meet the case, and
                                 I
it was for this reason that made further experiments with the help
of a grant made to me by the Lords of Committee of Council on
Education at the recommendation of this Society. The results have
been described in some of the former papers of this series.                In
making these experiments, and in drawing certain conclusions from
them, all favourable to the hypothesis referred to,            I was simply
carrying out the details of the work then begun, and nothing
more.
    In former  papers   I referred    to several great explosions which had
come under my own immediate observation.                In particular  I had
made a very careful and complete examination of Penygraig Colliery
 after the explosion there in December, 1880 (“Proc. Roy. Soc.,"
vol. 32, p. 454), when    I found that the <U+FB02>ame had penetrated into every
working place in the mine. The plan which accompanies No.                 III
paper shows that all the working places were ventilated by what was,
practically, a single current of air. It was, therefore, open to those
who attribute every great explosion to the occurrence of a sudden
outburst of <U+FB01>re-damp, and, as the annals of mining show, they con-
stituted a very large majority before the appearance of my <U+FB01>rst paper
on coal-dust, to say that this explosion was due to the same cause.
For this reason     I  have paid particular attention to the phenomena
due to the explosion which occurred at Dinas Colliery on the 13th of
January, 1879.      I do not propose to enter into the minute details of
this case, as  I  should to a large extent simply be repeating what         I
stated about Penygraig explosion, but will con<U+FB01>ne myself to those
which are necessary or new.         I  had frequently inspected the workings
before the explosion, and      I  have done so at intervals of one month or
less since then, so that    I have been intimately acquainted with all the
conditions of the mine for many years.           I know also that no sudden
outburst of <U+FB01>re-damp has ever been known to take place in it. The
werkings were naturally very dry, the temperature ranging from 75°
to 82° F., and the <U+FB02>oor was covered with coal-dust.           Shot <U+FB01>ring was
carried on by night when the explosion happened. The damage done
by the explosion was very great, the workings being wrecked to such
an extent as to lead to their temporary abandonment.               They were
re-opened after a large expenditure of time and labour, and it was
only towards the end of last year that I was able to inspect the

 46              Mr. A. \V. Blyth.       Observations on the         [May 15,
  working places A, B, C, shown in the accompanying plan, and early in
  the present year that   I could get into those marked D, E. With the
  exception of some burnt hay or dried grass which            I  found at the
  point X in one  of the  return  air-ways, I saw  no  traces of  burning nor
 deposits of coked coal-dust in any of the main roadways, but          I found
  well-marked deposits of coked coal-dust in all the working places in
 both districts of workings as far as       I was able to penetrate.       The
 plan shows that the current of fresh air which came down the down
 cast shaft was split up into three separate currents at the points K
 and L. The districts A, B, G, and D, E, were thus ventilated quite
 independently of each other, and thus it was impossible for any out
 burst of <U+FB01>re-damp which might take place in one of themto affect the
 quality of the air in the other.
    We are thus compelled to fall back upon some other mode of
 explanation in this case, and    I now submit that in the present, and in
 my previous papers,    I   have brought forward suf<U+FB01>cient evidence to
 show that the coal-dust hypothesis is the only tenable one.          If it be
 admitted, however, that this hypothesis is applicable to Dinas
 explosion, the conclusion is inevitable that, cwte'n's paribus, it is equally
 applicable to every case of the same kind that has ever occurred.

    On the 15th day of March, 1884, Mr. Edward P. Weston <U+FB01>nished
successfully a pedestrian feat, which consisted in walking 50 miles a
day, Sundays excepted, until he had traversed 5,000 miles.
    The last 300 miles were walked on a level track in the Victoria
Hall; and frequent observations of the pedestrian’s pulse and respira
tion, &c., were made during six days by Mr. Green, M.R.C.S., acting
under the instructions of a Committee, the active members of whom
were Dr. B. W. Richardson and Dr. Ridge.             Mr. Green also made
some volumetric determinations of urea for the purposes of his clinical
report ; and be measured the urine, preserved the faeces, and weighed
or measured all the food, whether liquid or solid.
                I
    Day by day received the urine for detailed analysis, and at the
termination of the walk       I also received a jar containing the faeces
collected during the <U+FB01>ve days ending at midnight, Saturday, 15th

48                  Mr. A. .\N. Blyth.         Observations on the         [May 15,
    Dr. Richardson      has published elsewhere‘ an account of the            results
of the general clinical observations, and it suf<U+FB01>ces to remark, that the
pedestrian during the whole time enjoyed the most robust health, and
at the termination of the walk was apparently in no way the worse
for the continuous exertion of so many months.
    My own part in the observations on Weston has been the analysis
of the egesta and the calculation of the food equivalents.                The latter
have been, for the most part, based upon analyses in my own work
on “Food,” supplemented by the mean numbers given in Konig’s
“Nahrungsmittel,” and in two instances by analyses of the actual
foods consumed?
                              The Food taken.         Ingesta.
    The bulk of the food was taken in three meals—breakfast, dinner,
and supper. Carbohydrates were supplied chie<U+FB02>y through porridge,
bread-stu<U+FB01>s, potatoes, and tapioca pudding;                    albuminoids through
eggs, <U+FB01>sh, lean beef or mutton; some fat was taken in the shape of
butter, and there was a copious supply of liquids by means of mutton
broth, tea, co<U+FB01>ee, and aerated waters; it is also noticeable that each
day a certain number of <U+FB01>gs were eaten.                    Table 1 (p. 47) gives the
amounts of the various constituents in grams and cubic centi
metres.
    In Table      II the somewhat complicated diet is reduced to “ food
 equivalents.”
    The last day, Saturday, was in some points not comparable with
 the others; besides which, we have the results of an analysis of the
 solid excretaI corresponding to the food. of the <U+FB01>ve days, from
 Monday to Friday inclusive, so that it is best to take the average of
 the <U+FB01>ve days previous to Saturday, and this average may be compared
 with any standard diet which would keep a man of Weston’s weight
 in health during ordinary labour.

 this paper is supposed to wholly belong to the same day.

and then shaking up with chloroform; but in no instance could any
evidence of indigo be obtained. By the time the urine reached me it

50              Mr. A. W. Blyth.      Observations on the      [May 15,
ordinary estimation of urea would have given low results; it there
fore appeared better to estimate the total nitrogen, and with certain
deductions described further on to calculate out the urea from the
data thus obtained. The total nitrogen was estimated by the moist
process of combustion, <U+FB01>rst proposed, I believe, by Vijeldahl (“ Zeitsch.
fiir Analytische Chemie,” Heft 3, 1883), and recently submitted to a
very exhaustive research as applied to urine by Dr. Petri and Th.
Lehmann (“ Zeitsch. fiir Physiologische Chemie,” Band VIII, Heft 3,
1884). It is a very accurate method of determining the total nitrogen
in urine, in milk, and probably in most organic liquids, and will,
without doubt, be much used.
   Two grms. of the urine were placed in a <U+FB02>ask, and 20 cub. centims.
of pure sulphuric acid added; heat was applied by means of a small
<U+FB02>ame for two or three hours, at the end of which time crystals of
permanganate were added until the liquid was <U+FB01>rst decolorised, and
then given a distinct dark pink or red tint. On now alkalising with
pure soda, all the nitrogen present was distilled over as ammonia;
the distillation being assisted by a current of hydrogen gas; the
ammoniacal distillate was received in a known quantity of standard
decinormal acid, and titrated back by decinormal soda, using as an
indicator phenolphthale'in.
   The uric acid was determined in the usual way, viz., by concen
trating half a litre of the <U+FB01>ltered urine, strongly acidifying with
hydrochloric acid, and, after twenty-four hours, collecting the crystals
on a weighed <U+FB01>lter.
   The hippuric acid was estimated by adding some recently calcined
magnesia to a litre of the urine, concentrating to a syrup, acidifying
the syrup with hydrochloric acid, and extracting the acid liquid with
             '
ether.
    The alkaloids (mostly kreatinine) were determined by acidifying
 with sulphuric acid, and then precipitating by phosphomolybdic
 acid; the precipitate was decomposed by baryta at a boiling tem
 perature; the phosphomolybdate of baryta <U+FB01>ltered off} and well
 washed; the <U+FB01>ltrate containing the urine alkaloids and baryta was
 saturated by carbon dioxide, boiled, concentrated, and <U+FB01>ltered, the
 <U+FB01>ltrate being evaporated to dryness and weighed; as there was still a
 trace of baryta, it was necessary to ignite, re-weigh, and to take the
 loss as representing the total alkaloids.
    The urea, as before said, was not estimated directly, but was calcu
 lated from the total nitrogen after subtracting the nitrogen in the
 uric and hippuric acids and in the urine alkaloids; it may be a tri<U+FB02>e
 over-estimated.
    For the total solids 5 grms. of the urine were evaporated at 100° C.
 in a platinum dish, until the weight was practically constant. From
 a larger quantity concentrated to a syrup, the mineral matter was

                   Excretion of Sulphates and Organic Sulphur.
     As a subsidiary research, the sulphates were precipitated from a
 measured sample of the urine by barium chloride, and after the
 precipitate had been separated, the organic sulphur compound was
 broken up by saturating the liquid with chlorine.                By this means, a
 second precipitate of barium sulphate was thrown down, and in the
 following table is calculated into organic sulphur.

   It is possible to ’arrive at the probable origin of the sulphur both
oxidised and unoxidised, by arranging the days of the week in order
so that the day of most sulphur excretion is at the top, of least
sulphur excretion at the bottom; and then to take from Table I the
several foods, and arranging them in a similar order to see whether
there is any coincidence.
   The days in the order of sulphur excretion are Friday, Wednesday,
Saturday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Monday.
   Since albumin constantly contains sulphur, the sulphates might
be governed by the total albuminoids, but a glance at Table V will
show that the albumin sequence is Thursday, Wednesday, Friday,
Monday, Tuesday, and Saturday, which has no relationship with the
sulphur sequence.           It may be similarly shown that for a like reason,
the liquids, the cabbages, the oatmeal, and all other constituents save
the bread-stuffs may be excluded.

added together, and then the days arranged in order, show avery
remarkable coincidence as follows, and renders it in the highest
degree probable that the greater or less excretion of sulphates
depended in Weston’s case on the amount of bread-stuffs consumed.

                          Note on    the  Urine Alkaloids.
    The   alkaloids of the urine, especially kreatinine, have been
 variously considered as derived from metabolism of the living muscle,
 or from nitrogenous food.             It is instructive to observe that the
 urine alkaloids in Weston’s case were in excess on Monday, a day
 which followed twenty-four hours of complete rest, while during the
 rest of the week save Saturday, the amounts were rather below
 normal, the days arranged in series of most alkaloid down to least
 alkaloid  are Monday, Saturday,          Friday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thurs
 day, and this series   shows no agreement with either the meat ingested
 or the broth. It      would, therefore, seem that exertion, so far from
 increasing the excretion of the <U+FB02>esh bases, oxidises them up probably

    The solid excreta for the <U+FB01>ve days, Tuesday to Saturday inclusive,
 were mixed as thoroughly as possible, and analysed as follows :—
    A weighed portion was digested with strong alcohol to remove as
 much of the water as possible, the dehydrated residue was then
 exhausted in a Soxhlet’s apparatus by ether; the alcoholic and
 ethereal extracts were united, dried, and weighed; the exhausted
 residue was also dried and weighed; the difference between the sum
 of these weights and the original was taken as representing the
 water. I may remark that I have always found the method detailed
 give more constant results than drying in the usual way.
    The fat and cholesterin were extracted from a weighed portion by
 ether-alcohol, the volatile solvents being driven off, the extract was
 dried, redissolved by anhydrous ether-alcohol, and on evaporation
 weighed as fat and cholesterin; subsequently the cholesterin was
  extracted by saponifying the fat, and treating the soap with ether.

    The albuminoids in the food during the <U+FB01>ve days in which the total
 egesta were collected, amounted to 11792 grms., representing 186'2
 grms. of nitrdgen; the total nitrogen eliminated through the kidneys
 during the same period was 117'5 grins, and through the bowels
48‘8 grms.; this subtracted from the nitrogen of the food gives a
 diiference of 199 grms. ; hence although all the nitrogen excreted
 is accounted for as derived from the food, some seems to have
 been retained, and the nitrogenous               equilibrium          was not quite
perfect.

faeces and urine, the heat-units of which were equivalent to 457,882,
there were left 2,464,129 heat-units as representing the carbon and
hydrogen which may be considered to have undergone complete
combustion.     A similar calculation gives the mean daily numbers of
Weston’s heat-units as 4,690,183, or just about twice the amount that
Vierordt calculated for a man doing ordinary work on the standard
diet given above.
   Assuming the usual formula to be correct, that a person walking
on a level surface raises {6 of his weight through the distance walked,
then the work done by Weston daily in the Victoria Hall was equal
to 2,462,071 kilogram-metres (793 foot-ton).        It has usually been
held that 1,552,795 kilogram-metres (500 foot-tons) daily was exces
sive labour, most ordinary work being little more than one-third of
this.
   Although for a limited time Weston himself, as well as others, has
undergone more exertion, his feat is, I believe, the greatest recorded
labour, if its continuity be considered, that any human being has ever
undertaken without injury.

I.  “ The Conditions of Chemical Change in Gases: Hydrogen,
      Carbonic Oxide, and Oxygen.” By HAROLD B. DIXON, M.A.
      Communicated by Professor A. W. WILLIAMsON, Foreign
      Sec.  RS.    Received May         15, 1884.
                                  (Abstract)
   Bunsen<U+FB01>“ in 1852, exploded mixtures of carbonic oxide and
electrolytic gas in different proportions in order to test the correctness
of the “ Law of Mass.”       According to this law the division of oxygen
between two combustible gases depends both on the relative af<U+FB01>nity
of the two combustibles for oxygen, and on the quantities of them
present. In 1857 Bunsen? published some further experiments on
the same subject. He concluded from his results that the Law of
Mass was modi<U+FB01>ed in a particular way by the tendency of the atoms
to form simple hydrates of carbonic acid; so that the ratio of
carbonic oxide to hydrogen might be changed within certain limits
without altering the proportion in which. the oxygen divides itself;
but, on still further changing the ratio of carbonic oxide to hydrogen,
the proportion in which the oxygen divides itself changes per saltum.
The ratio between the carbonic acid and the stream produced in the
explosion might always be expressed, according to Bunsen, by small
integers.
   In  1874   E. v. MeyerI published experiments             on the incomplete
combustion     of mixtures    of carbonic oxide and hydrogen by oxygen

1884.]         The Conditions         of Chemical Change in       Gases.        57
and by nitrous oxide. He concluded that the division of the oxygen
between the combustible gases changes per saltum, and that the ratio
between the carbonic acid and steam produced might always be
expressed by whole numbers, but not always by small integers.
   v. Meyer found that the presence of an inert gas, nitrogen,
faVQured the formation of carbonic acid.                He also found that more
steam was generally formed when the explosions were made in
narrow tubes than when they were made in wide tubes.
   In 1876 Horstmann* published a paper in a local journal at
 Heidelberg in which he showed that Bunsen’s results were vitiated
by his having exploded the gaseous mixtures in a eudiometer saturated
with aqueous vapour. At the high temperature of the explosion,
steam oxidises carbonic oxide, so that the proportion of carbonic acid
found after the explosion partly depended upon the initial tempera
ture of the eudiometer, and the quantity of steam consequently
present.
   Horstmann showed that there was no discontinuous alteration in
the ratio of the carbonic acid to steam formed in the explosion
either in presence of aqueous vapour or without.
   In the same year, 1876, in ignorance of Horstmann’s paper, I
repeated Bunsen’s experiments, and came to the same conclusion as
Horstmann.         I   found that the aqueous vapour in the eudiometer
reacted with the excess of carbonic oxide at the high temperature
reached.    I   repeated the experiments, drying the eudiometer and the
gases carefully before exploding.                My results gave no evidence  '
                                                                                of
any change per saltum           in the division of the oxygen.
   In testing the dried gases it was discovered that an electric spark
does not ignite a dry mixture of carbonic oxide and oxygenxl'                    A
trace of aqueous vapour was found to render the mixture explosive,
all other conditions being the same. A mixture of the gases
imperfectly dried with freshly fused potash was found to be unaffected
by a spark at pressures below 500 millims.                  At a pressure of 500
millims.  the    mixture     was  ignited by   the spark and  burnt slowly. When
left in contact with anhydrous phosphoric acid, either over mercury
or scaled up in tubes, amixture of two volumes of carbonic oxide with
one of oxygen may be subjected, under atmospheric pressure, to
powerful sparks from a coil or Leyden jar without exploding or
igniting. The addition of a trace of steam, of dry hydrogen, dry
ether vapour, dry pentane vapour, dry sulphuretted hydrogen, or dry
hydrochloric acid vapour, was found to render the mixture in<U+FB02>am
mable, all the other conditions being the same.                   Dr. Bdtschi has
published a paper in which he denies the non-in<U+FB02>ammability of dry

58                            Mr. H. B. Dixon.                        [May 29,
carbonic oxide and oxygen; he considers that the in<U+FB01>ammability of
the mixture depends only upon pressure, and that in my experiments
the mixture was tested under a less pressure when dry than when
wet.   This explanation of Dr. Bdtsch’s does not account for the
facts observed.     Under a pressure of 760 millims. the dry gases
do not unite, while the wet mixture is explosive.              The addition of
a small quantity        of nitrogen, carbonic acid, cyanogen, nitrous
oxide, or carbon bisulphide, does not render the dry mixture in<U+FB02>am
mable.
   The part played by the steam in the ordinary explosion of carbonic
oxide and oxygen is similar to that of the nitric oxide in the
sulphuric acid chamber. By suffering a succession                  of alternate
reductions and oxidations the steam converts the carbonic oxide into
carbonic acid. With very little steam this conversion is compara
tively slow, so that in a nearly dry mixture there is no explosion, but
the disk of <U+FB02>ame is seen to travel slowly down the tube.                  With
increasing quantities of aqueous vapour the rapidity of in<U+FB02>ammation
increases. An attempt‘ was made to measure this increase in the
velocity of explosion by observing the pressures produced in the
eudiometer when equal masses of carbonic oxide and oxygen
were <U+FB01>red under nearly identical               conditions of       temperature,
pressure,   and   cooling    surface,   but  with    diiferent  proportions of
steam.    These experiments showed that the velocity of explosion
increased with increasing quantities of steam, but they gave no
absolute value for the rates of explosion.           To obtain absolute rates
direct measurements were made, with a chronograph, of the time
which elapsed between the passage of the spark through the mixture,
and the breaking of a thin silver bridge at the other end of the
explosion tube about 1 metre from the <U+FB01>ring point.                The explosion
 tube of 13  millims.  diameter    was soldered into    a metal trough, so that
 each end projected a short distance from the end of the trough.            The
 trough was <U+FB01>lled with water at the desired temperature. To
 determine the rate of explosion of the nearly dry gases, the mixture
 was forced slowly into the explosion tube (1) through two sulphuric
 acid drying tubes, and (2) through two long tubes containing anhydrous
 phosphoric acid. By removing the phosphoric acid tubes the gases
 were tested in a less dry state.      By making the gases bubble slowly
 through a wash-bottle containing water at di<U+FB02>’erent temperatures
 below the temperature of the explosion tube, the quantity of steam
 added to the mixture could be approximately measured.
    The following table gives the results of these velocity experi~
 ments:—

    The velocity of explosion was found to increase rapidly from the
point of in<U+FB02>ammation. When a mixture of carbonic oxide and
oxygen saturated with steam at 10° was exploded in a tube 13
millims. diameter, the velocity was found to be constant after the
explosion had travelled 700 millims. along the tube.                          The constant
velocity of the explosive wave attained under these conditions is
rather over 1,500 metres per second.                     Berthelot and Viei11e* give

1,090  for the velocity of explosion of “dry”           carbonic    oxide   and
oxygen.
   A comparison of the results obtained when dry carbonic oxide and
electrolytic gas were exploded in a dried eudiometer with those
obtained by Horstmann, and with those obtained by Bunsen,‘ using a
chain of sparks to <U+FB01>re the mixture, revealed the fact that both changes
in the shape of the vessel and changes in the initial pressure under
which the gases are <U+FB01>red, affect the division of the oxygen.                 By
continually increasing the initial pressure, a pressure     is reached   where
no further increase a<U+FB01>ects the division of the oxygen. At and above
this “ critical pressure,” the division of the oxygen is also independent
of the shape of the vessel.    The larger the quantity of oxygen used
the lower the critical pressure is found to be.
   When dry mixtures of carbonic oxide and hydrogen in varying
                                         “ critical            ”
proportions are exploded above the                   pressure      with oxygen
insuf<U+FB01>cient for complete combustion,       an   equilibrium     is  established
 between two opposite chemical changes represented by the equa
tions—
                        (1) CO+H20=COQ+H2
                        (2) oo,+H,=oo+H,o.
 So that at the end of the reaction the product of the carbonic oxide
and steam molecules is equal to the product of the carbonic acid and
hydrogen molecules multiplied by a “coef<U+FB01>cient of af<U+FB01>nity.”                 This
result agrees with Horstmann’s conclusion. But Horstmann con
siders the coef<U+FB01>cient to vary with the relative mass of oxygen
taken.
   A small difference in the initial temperature at which the gases are
<U+FB01>red makes a considerable difference in the products of the reaction.
 This difference is due to the condensation of steam on the sides of
the vessel during the explosion, and its consequent removal from the
 sphere of action during the chemical change.            When the gases are
exploded at a temperature su<U+FB02>iciently high to prevent any conden
sation of steam during the progress of the reaction, the “coef<U+FB01>cient
of af<U+FB01>nity” is found to be constant whatever the quantity of
oxygen used, provided that the hydrogen is more than double the
oxygen.
   The presence of an inert gas, such as nitrogen, by diminishing the
intensity of the reaction, favours the formation of carbonic acid in
preference to steam.      When the hydrogen is less than double the
oxygen the excess of oxygen cannot react with any of the three other
gases present—carbonic oxide, carbonic acid, and steam—but has to
wait until an equal volume of steam is reduced to hydrogen by the
                       * “ Gasom. Meth.,” 2te Au<U+FB02>age.

 carbonic oxide. The excess of inert oxygen has the same e<U+FB01>ect as
 the inert nitrogen in favouring the formation of carbonic acid.
     The variations in the coef<U+FB01>cient of affinity found by Horstmann
 with different quantities of oxygen are due partly to this cause, but
 chie<U+FB02>y to the varying amounts of steam condensed by the cold
 eudiometer during the reaction in different experiments.
    As the general result of these experiments it has been shown that
 when a mixture of carbonic oxide and hydrogen is exploded with
 insuf<U+FB01>cient oxygen for complete combustion, at a temperature at
 which no condensation of steam can take place during the reaction,
 and at a pressure greater than the critical pressure, an equilibrium
 between two opposite changes is established, which is independent of
 the quantity of oxygen taken, so long as this quantity is less than
 half the hydrogen. Within the limits marked out above, the law of
 mass is completely veri<U+FB01>ed for the gaseous system composed           of
 carbonic oxide, carbonic acid, hydrogen, and steam at a high tem
 perature.

    Eichler, in his dissertation on the development of the leaf, de<U+FB01>ned
the primordial leaf as the young leaf before internal di<U+FB01>erentiation or
external distinction of parts; and further pointed out that subse
quently two parts of it may be distinguished—the foliar base (blatt
grund) which gives rise to the sheath and the stipules, if present, and
the upper leaf (oberblatt) which developes into the simple branched
lamina.    The petiole is also, according to Eichler, derived from the
upper   leaf, though'Goebel describes it as being intercalated between
the two parts. The <U+FB01>rst part of the present paper is devoted to a
discussion of this mode of treatment of the leaf. In accordance with
the views clearly expressed by Sachs and others, the terms stem and
leaf are to be regarded only as expressions denoting certain relation
ships of the parts of the shoot,- the leaf is essentially an outgrowth
from the stem. If this proposition be accepted, the same mode of
morphological treatment ought to be applied to both. Now, in the
treatment of the shoot as a whole, priority of importance is always
attached to the mode of origin, and sequence of appearance of the
several parts, while subsequent changes of conformation and dis

 62              Mr. F. O. Bower.        On  the Leaf of   the      [May 29,
 turbance of their arrangement, resulting from peculiarities of the dis
 tribution and localisation of growth, are regarded as of but secondary
 importance.     In treating of the leaf, however, this principle is not
 kept  in view.    The very distinction of foliar base and upper leaf is
 chie<U+FB02>y based upon results of intercalary growth which would be
 regarded as but of secondary importance in treating of the shoot
 at large. One of the objects of the investigations detailed in this
 paper was to ascertain, by comparative study of the lower forms,
 whether there is suf<U+FB01>cient ground for this inconsistency of treatment.
 It is further pointed out that, though this treatment is not open to
 obvious objection in the case of simple leaves, in branched leaves the
parts thus distinguished are not morphologically co-ordinate.             On
 dividing the leaf into foliar base and upper leaf, a distinction is
 drawn between the lower part of the axis (so to speak) of the leaf
and the whole of its upper branch system—a distinction which might
be compared with that of the hole of a forest tree below the lowest
branches from the whole of the upper part of the trunk with its
branches of all orders; such a distinction would not lead to a true
knowledge of the morphology of the tree, or of the relation of its
parts one to another.       It is found that a comparative study of the
leaf of the lower vascular plants does not justify the continuance of
this inconsistency in the method of treatment of axis and leaf, but
rather that the leaves of the lower forms lend themselves to a con
sistent treatment throughout their length as branch systems.           As we
rise in the scale, the main axis of the branch system becomes gradu
ally more differentiated as a supporting organ, distinct from the
members of higher order which it bears, while the assimilating func
tion chie<U+FB02>y devolves upon its <U+FB02>attened branches.
    This being the case, this axis must be recognised by a distinct
term: the name phyllopodium is proposed to designate the main axis of
the leaf exclusive of its branches (pinnae); thus the relation of the
pinna to the phyllopodium is similar to that of the leaf to the axis.
Three parts of the phyllopodium may be distinguished in complicated
leaves, but this distinction is only to be drawn where a difference
really exists; the basal portion may be called the hypopodium, and
                             “              ”
coincides with Eichler’s       blattgrund ;    the mesopod'ium is the equiva
lent of the petiole; the third part, or epipodium, differs from the
“ oberblatt ” of Eichler in
                               including only the upper part of the phyllo
podium,    exclusive of its branches.   This method of treatment of the
leaf is consistent with the treatment of the stem, while the parts
severally distinguished are morphologically co-ordinate.            As above
stated, this method is amply borne out, and shown to be a natural
one, by the study of the development of leaves in the lower vascular
plants.
    The second part of the paper is devoted to a detailed comparison

of the development of the leaf in a series of types of Vascular Crypto
gams and Gymnosperms, beginning with those lowest in the scale;
the third part points out the conclusions to be drawn from that com
parative study. The chief facts and conclusions are as follows :—
   In the simplest forms, the Hymenophyllacece, the apex of the young
leaf, is, according to Prantl, <U+FB02>attened, and has the two-sided apical
cell so characteristic of <U+FB02>attened organs; it branches chie<U+FB02>y, if not
exclusively, by dichotomy.      By the stronger development of one
limb of each dichotomy a sympodial arrangement is produced,
which appears in the mature leaf as an apparently well-de<U+FB01>ned
pseudo-axis or phyllopodium ; but since the branching is dichotomous,
 the phyllopodium is not clearly differentiated in the <U+FB01>rst instance
from the less strongly developed limbs.        It is characteristically a
<U+FB02>attened structure, and is in most cases winged to its extreme base; and
though the leaf is complicated, it has no peculiarity of conformation
at the base to which the term hypopodium could with reason be
applied.
  In the     majority of Leptospomngiate Ferns, exclusive of the
Hymenophyllaceee    and Osmundaceaa, the apex of the phyllopodium still
retains the two-sided apical cell so characteristic of <U+FB02>attened organs,
but the branching of the leaf is at <U+FB01>rst mon0podial, though there is
sometimes a return to the dichotomous branching in the higher
rami<U+FB01>cations ; its apical growth is in some cases unlimited.         Thus the
phyllopodium    is here   more clearly  differentiated   from  the pinnae, the
structure of the apex        however, still that characteristic of <U+FB02>attened
                               is,
organs;    it   is winged structure to its extreme base, though the
                     a
wings are in many cases reduced to mere lateral ridges.
   In the Osmundaceaa the two-sided apical cell of the above-named
ferns is replaced, during the earlier stages of development, by a three
sided, conical, apical, cell; and     itbelieved that in this respect they
                                           is
are unique among vascular plants. The young phyllopodium                    is
thus typically a solid structure;         itstill winged, and its branching
                                                is
is  mon0podial;      shows peculiar modi<U+FB01>cations of form at the base,
                         it
but these are referable without di<U+FB02>iculty to the fundamental winged
structure; the apical growth        long continued, and in its upper parts
                                     is
the phyllopodium becomes <U+FB02>attened as in other ferns.
   In Angiopteris, as an example of the Marattiaceaa, there      is  no single
apical  cell occupying   the bulky apex    of  the  phyllopodium, but in its
place there     is group of four cells, and in this respect
                     a                                         it  approaches
the higher types of vascular plants.           The phyllopodium     is  thus a
solid structure from the <U+FB01>rst, its apical growth        is   limited, and its
branching mon0podial, though the order of succession of the pinnae          is
here, as in other ferns, strictly ac'ropetal.         The peculiar stipulai
 structure at the base     referable in the light of similar structures in
                              is
 Todea to modi<U+FB01>cation of the winged structure.

    Finally, in the   Cycadacew the rounded apex of the phyllopodium      is
 covered   by a de<U+FB01>nite layer of dermatogen; its grOWth is never very
distinctly apical, though in Cycas, and perhaps in Dioon, it is more
 so than in other genera ; it is winged throughout.       Its branching is
in all cases Monopodial, but the order of succession is, with exception
of the upper pinnee in the above-named genera, basipetal.
    From the above and other facts, it is clear that in the series of
plants above dealt with, a progressive differentiation may be traced of
the phyllopodium on the one hand as a supporting organ, and on the
other hand of the other members of higher order, which develops as
<U+FB02>attened organs. The phyllopodium in the <U+FB01>rst named families is
typically a <U+FB02>attened organ with unlimited apical growth; in the
higher members of the series it is a solid structure from the <U+FB01>rst, and
 its apical growth is arrested at an early period. Moreover, while in
 the lower forms it branches dichotomously, in the higher members of
the series it branches monopodially, and is thus clearly distinguished
at all times from the members of higher order which it bears.         It is
thought   that  this progressive di<U+FB02>ierentiation of the phyllopodium as a
 supporting organ among the similar members of a branch system may
throw light upon the mode of origin of the axis as a structure bearing
leaves; and it is suggested that this analogy is at least closer than
any that can be drawn from the study of the leafy Musat'neaa.       As the
phyllopodium gradually asserts, and in the higher forms of the above
series, maintains its identity among the branches of the leaf, so the
axis may have di<U+FB01>erentiated itself as a supporting organ from among
members similar to itself in origin and development.
    011 ascending through this series of plants, there is further seen a
 gradual restriction of the apical growth, which in the simpler ferns is
 sometimes    unlimited.    This leads on towards the higher vascular
plants, in which the apical growth of the leaf usually ceases at an
early stage, the general conformation of the leaf being due, as above
pointed cut, in much greater degree to intercalary growth.           Since
this change is gradual, no important difference of morphological
treatment of the leaf in the lower and the higher forms ought to be
based upon it.       Now the leaves in the lower forms naturally lend
themselves to a treatment throughout as branch systems, while there
is even in some complicated fern leaves no structure which can
warrant a distinction of the foliar base from the upper leaf. On these
grounds, and in the light of this comparative study, it is concluded
that the recognition of the phyllopodium, and treatment of the whole
leaf as a simple branch or as a branch system, is in accordance with
the true nature of the leaf as seen in all vascular plants : while at the
same time, if this method were adopted, the whole shoot would then
be subjected to consistent morphological treatment, since the relation
of the pinnae to the phyllopodium is similar to that of the whole leaf

                   Changes and ultimate         Fate of the Blastopore in
        the Newt (Triton cristatus)? By ALICE JOHNSON, N ewnham
        College, Cambridge. Communicated by Professor MICHAEL
        FOSTER, Sec. RS.        Received May 15, 1884.
     In a paper lately published on “The Origin“ of Metameric Seg
  mentation,” Mr. Sedgwick mentions that he was led to conclude
 from surface views of a large number of stages that the blastopore
  of the newt (Triton cristatus) does not close, but persists as the anus.
 He suggested to me afterwards that           I  should attempt to test this
 observation by cutting sections of the embryos, and my results fully
 con<U+FB01>rm what he previously stated.
     Scott and Osborn, in their account of the development of the
 newt, describe a posterior dilatation of the medullary canal, the sinus
 rhomboidalis, which remains open for some time after the rest of
 the canal has closed.    They say that its folds enclose the blastopore,
 and that, therefore, when they come together, a neurenteric canal is
 formed.     Their account of the exact date of the closure of the
 medullary folds in this region is a little obscure, but seems to
 indicate that the event takes place while the number of protovertebraa
 is quite small, and before the rudiments of the visceral arches and
 tail have appeared.
    Hertwig <U+FB01>gures an open blastopore at a slightly later stage than
this, but, judging from his surface views of the embryo, it is situated
at the hind end of the tail.
    At a stage when the medullary folds are widely apart, the slightly
 elongated blastopore is placed at the hind end of the body.            While
 the folds are approaching one another the dorsal surface grows faster
than the ventral, so that the blastopore is carried round on to the
ventral surface. When the folds have completely coalesced, and
before there is any trace of a tail, the blastopore is placed at some
little distance from the hind end, which is much swollen and spherical
in outline.
    In transverse sections of the stage just described we <U+FB01>nd the blasto
pore actually communicating with a cavity in the midst of the yolk
cells. This cavity is so exceedingly narrow that it can hardly be

66             The Changes in the Blastopore      of  the Newt.   [May 29,
 traced into connexion with the middle part of the gut.           (In longi
tudinal sections it appears as a mere line, but its continuity with the
 rest of the gut can then be clearly followed.)
    For some distance behind the blastopore all the layers are fused in
the middle ventral line. We <U+FB01>nd, in fact, a primitive streak, exactly
comparable with that of the amniotic vertebrata.            Passing further
backwards, a large solid roundish mass is gradually marked off in the
middle line from the lateral plates of mesoblast and the hypoblast
yolk-cells.    This mass gradually acquires a lumen, and is <U+FB01>nally con
tinued round into the medullary canal on the dorsal surface. Thus
                                                    I
there is no neurenteric canal at this time, and have equally failed to
<U+FB01>nd it at any other stage.
    The tail next buds out from the region behind the blastopore.          It
is a small roundish knob, its apex pointing downwards and forwards
on account of the ventral curvature of the whole body. Scott and
Osborn describe it as “ an unsegmented mass of mesoblast."          I should
prefer to call it an outgrowth of the front end of the primitive streak,
in which the same features that        I have described in the previous
stage are now seen still more clearly.        As it passes back from the
dorsal surface round the hind end of the body, the medullary canal
loses its lumen and becomes a solid cord of epiblast, distinct from
the notochord and lateral plates of mesoblast.             A few sections
further on, it becomes indistinguishably fused with both these struc
tures, and a mass of cells is thus formed, from which a knob repre
senting the rudiment of the notochord projects into the central yolk
cells. Passing still in the same direction along the ventral surface
towards the blastopore, the notochordal rudiment disappears and the
fused mass of cells becomes shorter from 'above downwards, and also
compressed from side to side.      The cavity of the hind gut is almost
obliterated in the hind part of the ventral side of the body, and then
 widens out again in front.     Here it is a slit, having its dorsal wall in
close contact   with its ventral wall, but comparatively broad from side
to side.    Further forwards it becomes wider from above downwards
and narrower from side to side, till it passes at the root of the tail
into the blastopore. The blastopore marks the extreme front end
of the primitive streak on the ventral surface.
    The solid condition of the hinder part of the medullary canal
for a short region before it becomes indistinguishably fused with
the primitive streak is described by Gasser in the bird, and he asserts
that the lumen is gradually continued back as the medullary canal is
differentiated out of the primitive streak. The description would,
I  think, apply equally well to the newt.
    I have not yet made out satisfactorily the condition of the primitive
streak in the early stages, but I hope to be able to elucidate this later,
and to publish <U+FB01>gures illustrating my results.

between the two principal canals (etc and co) in the arms of Crinoidea,
which had been regarded by Professor J. Miiller as a nerve, really
belongs to the reproductive apparatus ; and further, that I had been led
to regard as a nerve-trunk the solid cord (as) which traverses the axial
canal of each calcareous segment of the rays and arms, through
<U+FB01>nding that this cord gives off a regular system of branching <U+FB01>bres
 (hm, nm) to the muscular bundles (m, m) which intervene between the
calcareous segments, and which <U+FB02>ex the arms by their contraction.
   In a further communication on this subject made to the Royal
Society at the beginning of 1876,          I  supported this view by experi
mental evidencc ;* showing that in an eviscerated specimen of Antedon,
irritation of the quinquelocular organ (contained in the centro-dorsal
basin) from the walls of which the radial cords proceed, produces a
sudden and simultaneous contraction of the <U+FB02>exor muscles of the
arms, similar to that which       I  had mentioned in my Memoir           13) as
resulting in the natural condition of the animal from irritation of its
oral pinnules.
                                                             I
   That the supposed nerve of Miiller is really what stated it to be—
a genital rachis-had been independently ascertained by Professor
Semper,    and is now universally            acknowledged.      But my other
conclusion   has  not   gained    the  same acceptance.       Coincidently with
                                    I
the communication to which have last referred, it was a<U+FB01>irmed by
Professor Greef of Marburg and by Dr. Ludwig, that the real nerve
in the arms of Crinoidea is (as in other Stellerida), a <U+FB01>brillar band
(<U+FB01>g. 1, no) that lies beneath the epithelial <U+FB02>oor (ae) of the ambulacral
(ventral) furrow of the arms; a conclusion at which Professor Huxley
had independently arrived.           And this view is now very generally
received and taught in Germany.
   In a third communication which          I  shortly after'wards'l' made to the
                 I
Royal Society, referred to this doctrine ; and, whilst admitting the
probability that this sub-ambulacral band is really a nerve, I adduced
what seemed to me conclusive proof that it cannot be the nerve
through which the motor apparatus of the arms is called into action.
For, in the <U+FB01>rst place, it is far removed from this apparatus in
position; being separated from the muscles by the triple canal-system,
and not being connected with them (so far as can be discerned) by
any branching <U+FB01>bres.         And, further, the loss of the visceral mass
(which   contains   the   central   ring of this ambulacral nerve-system)
was not found in the least degree to interfere with the rhythmical
swimming actions of the animal; whilst a division of the ambulacral
nerve in any individual arm produced no paralysis of that arm.
   On the other hand,     I  stated that my son (who was then working in
the laboratory of Professor Semper at Wiirzburg) had fully con<U+FB01>rmed

                                              I
--by means of thin sections—the statement had made ten years pre
viously, as to the regular transmission of pairs of branches (<U+FB01>g. 1, nm,
nm) from the axial cord of the arms to their successive pairs of <U+FB01>exor
muscles; and    I adduced what seemed to me conclusive experimental
proof that these cords, which radiate from the wall of the central
quinquelocular organ, and are further connected with each other by
a commissural ring, have a motor function.
   In the <U+FB01>rst place, I argued _that the extraordinary co-ordination
which is manifested in the active swimming action of Antedon, when it
spontaneously leaves, or is detached from, the anchorage a<U+FB01>orded by
the grasp of its dorsal cirri, cannot be accounted forwithout a
de<U+FB01>nite direction' from a nervous centre. That this centre is not in
a circum-oral ring, is clear from the continuance of the regular move
ments after the complete evisceration of the animal.       On the other
hand, that it is contained within the centro-dorsal basin, was indicated
alike by the coiling-up of the arms when the quinquelocular organ
was irritated, and by the complete paralysis of the <U+FB01>exor muscles
which followed the removal of the centro-dorsal basin with its
contents. And, further, the destruction of a portion of the axial cord
of an arm, the ventral nerve being left uninjured, was shown to be
followed by complete paralysis of the muscles of that arm beyond the
injured part.
   The anatomical and the_experimenta1 evidence that the quinque
locular organ, with its radiating and branching cords, constitute the
motor nervous system of the arms, being thus in complete harmony,
I  ventured (p. 45%) to profess myself “ at a loss to understand what
is the superior probative force of the evidence which is universally
held to justify the assignment of such functions to the brain and
spinal cord, and the white solid cords proceeding from these centres,
in a Vertebrate animal.”                                          -
   That the sub-ambulacral band of Ludwig is also a nerve (as
homology would indicate),    I thought not improbable ; but looking to
its immediate proximity to the sensory (ventral) surface, and to the
absence of any connexion with the muscular apparatus, I thought
that it might probably be an afferent nerve, “the functions of the
single trunk of the Asterida being here' divided between two, an
afferent and a motor, just as, in Man, the double function of an
ordinary spinal nerve is divided in the head between the <U+FB01>fth and
seVenth pairs.”
   During the eight years which have elapsed since these statements
were made public, it might have been expected that my conclusions
would have been either accepted or controverted.       But the question
has been considered by many eminent Zoologists, especially in
Germany, as one which is so conclusively settled by Homology, as not

to be a matter for discussion; it being impossible (in their judgment)
that the axial cords of the arms should be nerves, whatever may be
the anatomical and experimental evidence that they are.            wouldI
submit, however, that the possibilities of Nature are not limited by
the dicta of her interpreters ;* that anatomical and experimental
facts are not to be set aside by preconceived theoretical opinions;
and that the morphology of the Crinoidea has to be settled upon the
basis of their own organisation, before it is brought into comparison
with that of other Echinodermata.         Now the question whether the
axial cords of Crinoidea do, or do not, form part of their nervous
system, has to be decided: <U+FB01>rst, by their Histological character;
secondly, by their Anatomical distribution; and, thirdly, by Physio
logical evidence;     and on each of these points              I
                                                           have now a
large body of new evidence to adduce, derived from the careful and
minute investigations on which my son, Dr. P. Herbert Carpenter, has
been continuously engaged during the last eight years. Of the results
of these investigations, which are scattered through the various
papers he has published on “Crinoid Morphology,”                   I
                                                              shall now
present a summary, arranged under the above heads; referring to
those papersi' for a more detailed statement of them.
   Histological Character.—-Although the axial cords do not consist of
tubular nerve-<U+FB01>bres—their substance being essentially protoplasmic,
and showing but an indistinct <U+FB01>brillation when hardened in spirit—
yet, scattered through these cords and their branches, Dr. P. H.
Carpenter has found distinct bi-polar and multi-polar cells; and he
has further ascertained that the sub-ambulacral band presents a
histological   character so precisely identical, notwithstanding     the
diiference of its origin, as to afford a strong presumption that if the
latter is a nerve, the former likewise is so. On the other hand, the
axial cords, which are regarded by Ludwig as merely unconsolidated
portions of the basis-substance of the calcareous segments, diifer
essentially from that substance histologically.
   Anatomical Distribution—Nothing can be more marked or more
constant than the distribution of the branches (<U+FB01>g. 1, nm, nm) of
the axial cords to the very de<U+FB01>nite inter-segmental muscular bundles
of the arms and pinnules, alike in the free and in the pedunculate

  lips of their ambulacral grooves, forming also an_extensive plexus

  hand,     the   sub-ambulacral nerves, which in 'Ophiurida send very
  distinct branches to the muscles of the arms, send no such branches
  to the arm-muscles of Crinoidea.             And thus the evidence furnished
  by anatomical distribution as to the source of the nerve-power which
  calls those muscles into contraction, is alike positive in regard to the
  axial cords, and negative in regard to the sub-ambulacral nerves. At
  the same time, the distribution of the branches of the axial cords to
  the perisome of the soft parts of the arms and pinnules, would indi
  cate that these have an afferent or sensory function)“
     Physiological Evidence—The inquiries of Dr. P. H. Carpenter,
  having     been entirely limited      to the anatomical examination of spirit
  specimens of Crinoidea, do not afford any direct con<U+FB01>rmation of the
 statements I formerly made as to the actions of living Antedons;
  but they furnish most remarkable con<U+FB01>rmatory evidence of an
 indirect kind—that,           namely, which may be deduced              from what
  Cuvier termed “ Experiments prepared for us by N ature.” For having
 met with numerous cases in which the ambulacral groove and the
 tentacular apparatus are wanting, whilst the 'arms and pinnules
 showing this de<U+FB01>ciency are normally constructed in other respects,
 he has invariably found that the ventral or sub-ambulacral nerve is
 alike de<U+FB01>cient, while the axial cord and its branches have their usual
 distribution.       Among these cases, the following may be speci<U+FB01>ed :—
     a. The long pinnules which come off from the second brachial
 segments of Antedon 'rosaoea, and which (from the manner in which
 they arch over the month during life) have been distinguished as
 oral pinnules, are destitute of the tentacular apparatus—as I pointed
 out in my original Memoir               16). This peculiarity has been found
by my      son  to be  a general   character  of the genus Antedon; and he has
further shown that, with the de<U+FB01>ciency of tentacles, there is also an
absence of the ordinary ciliated epithelium of the ambulacral groove,
and of the subjacent nerve and nerve-vesseH'
    * The observations of Dr. P. H. Carpenter upon the distribution of the branches
of the axial cords, have been fully con<U+FB01>rmed by those of M. Edmond Perrier;
who has been led by his own independent investigations on Antedon rosacea to the
full acceptance of the nervous character of these cords, notwithstanding his opposite

     b.   It
          has been noticed, as well by Ludwig as by Dr. P. H. Car
 penter, that in the terminal segments alike of the arms and of the
pinnules of Antedon Eschrictii, there isa similar want of the tentacular
 apparatus, with an obliteration of the ambulacral grooves by the
approximation and fusion of the elevated folds of perisome at their
 sides; and that here also the sub-ambulacral nerve is absent.
    a. The most remarkable case of this kind, however, is presented by
that aberrant type of Comatulidae which is distinguished generically
as Actinometra.    This genus differs from Antedon in the excentricity
of its mouth : the anal ori<U+FB01>ce being generally in or near the centre of
its ventral disk, whilst the mouth lies near its margin. This curious
disposition is not related to any departure from radial symmetry
in the structure either of the calcareous skeleton, of its muscular
apparatus, or of the axial cords whose branches are distributed to
the muscles and perisomatic surface of the arms; but it is associated
with a very marked irregularity in the disposition of the tentacular
and ambulacral apparatus.       For, whilst in the arms given off from
the oral side of the disk, some pairs of pinnules are usually destitute
both of tentacles and of ciliated ambulacral grooves, this de<U+FB01>ciency
is generally complete in-_a large proportion, not only of the pinnules,
but of the arms arising from the choral side of the disk, sometimes
amounting to one-half of the entire circle, and occasionally also on
the disk itself. And wherever the tentacles and ambulacral groove
are wanting, the sub-ambulacral nerve also is absent.        Yet we are
assured by Professor       Semper,   who  kept Actinometrw for weeks
together in his aquaria, that “he never saw the least trace of any
irregularity in the alternating movement of their arms while swim
ming; ” the non-tentaculated members, notwithstanding the want of
sub-ambulacral nerves, acting precisely like the tentaculated<U+FB01>“
    Thus, then, the “ Experiment prepared for us by Nature,” in
the subtraction of the sub-ambulacral nerve-system from certain
pinnules and arms of Comatulidae, entirely con<U+FB01>rms the conclusions
which      I
          drew frommy arti<U+FB01>cial induction of the same physiological
condition.    For it is,'ofcourse, impossible that their oral nerve-ring
can minister to the general sensori-motor actions of arms and pinnules
which receive no radial extensions of it; and yet the character of
those actions (as
                I     have already pointed out) so distinctly indicates
their dependence on the originating and co-ordinating power of a
nerve-centre, and on the internuncial power of nerve-cords, that we
must seek elsewhere for nervous mechanism on which they depend.

 in the muscular bundles and perisomatic surface, have to account for
 these two facts in the ordinary life-history of uninjured animals :—
<U+FB01>rst, the immediate and consentaneous contraction of the hundreds
  (or thousands) of arm-muscles in Antedon, called forth by irritation
 of the oral pinnules; and, secondly, the performance of swimming
 movements as regular as those of Antedon, by the non-tentaculated
 arms of Actinometrae—notwithstanding                    the absence, in both cases, of
 what is af<U+FB01>rmed to be their sole nervous supply.
     Thus, while the doctrine that the remarkable sensori-motor endow
 ments of the Crinoidea depend upon their ventral nervous system,
 consisting (as in Asterida and Ophiurida) of an oral ring with
 radial branches, is supported only by a theoretical homology, it is in
 direct contradiction to the following facts :—
     1. The absence of any branches from the sub-ambulacral nerves to
 the muscular apparatus of Crinoidea generally.
     2. The absence of sub-ambulacral nerves from those pinnules of
 Antedon which are most distinguished by their sensory endowments.
     3. The absence of snb-ambulacral nerves fromalarge proportion of
 the arms of Actinometrae, which, nevertheless, take their full share
 in the co-ordinated swimming movements of those animals.
     4:. The continued performance of these                  movements by Antedons
from which the whole visceral mass, including the oral ring, has been
removed, and by arms whose sub-ambulacral nerves have been cut
 near their base.
     On the other hand, the dependence of the general sensori-motor
endowments of Crinoidea upon what                    I have described as their dorsal
nerve-system,          is  a.  doctrine     which   has   been found to harmonise
alike with every fact that the most careful and minute study of their
                                                                               “

 nently remarked) without any suf<U+FB01>cient knowledge of the anatomy
 of this most interesting group.              Further, that this dorsal nerve
 system    is  the  fundamental       and  essential   sensori-motor apparatus of
 Crinoidea, and that their central nerve-system is secondary and
 accessory, is indicated by the universal presence of the former in
 every arm and pinnule, while the latter is frequently absent.                     And
 that the function of this latter is limited to the control of the tenta
 cular apparatus, appears probable from the constancy of its associa
 tion with that apparatus ; being invariably present in those arms and
 pinnules which are provided with tentacles, and absent in those which
-are destitute of them.
    In conclusion,      I   would remark that the question whether these
 axial cords do or do not constitute parts of the fundamental nervous
 system of Crinoidea, is one of far-reaching interest; since it obviously
 affects our whole conception of the morphology of the group.                      If  I
 am right in my contention, the centre of the nervous system of the
 Crinoidea has its seat in that Stem which is the most distinctive
 feature of their structure.           For the quinquelocular organ that lies
 in Antedon within the centre-dorsal basin, is only an expansion of
 the soft axis which occupies the central canal that extends through
 the entire length of the stem; repeating on a larger scale a similar
 dilatation that occurs at every node from which a circlet of cirri is
 given elf. And the radial skeleton of the stem, of the calyx, of the
 arms, and of the pinnules of a Crinoid, is even more completely built
 up on this elongated nerve-centre and its radial extensions, than is
 the longitudinally segmental skeleton of a Vertebrate animal upon its
 cranio-spinal axis,—a consideration which must be constantly kept
in view in any attempt to trace out the homologies of Crinoidea
with other Echinodermata.             To myself it has always appeared that
ambulach epithelium,      and of the ventral nerve, in a large proportion of the arms of
Actinometra, is altogether ignored.     As Dr. Weinberg seems to justify his disbelief
of Dr. P. H. Carpenter’s description, by his own failure, and that of Dr. Ludwig, to
verify them on Antedon rosacea, it may be well for me to state that its accuracy
has been veri<U+FB01>ed by careful examination of Dr. P. H. Carpenter’s preparations, not
only by myself, but by many other experienced Microscopists in this country;
whilst, as already mentioned (p. 71, note), Professor Perrier has been led by his
own independent investigations     to accept my own and my son’s statements as fully
borne out by microscopical     evidence.   As Dr. Weinberg, though he has had the
opportunity of studying Antedon rosacea alive, and of thereby refuting my experi
mental results, if erroneous, refrains from discussing them, and as he also ignores
the fact (though vouched for by Ludwig) that the ventral nerve is wanting in the
peculiarly sensitive oral pinnules of Antedon, it seems as if his con<U+FB01>dence in his
theoretical Morphology blinds him to every fact which con<U+FB02>icts with this.           The
complete con<U+FB01>rmation of my experiments by Professor A. M. Marshall and Dr. Carl
F. Jickeli (see ADDENDA) may perhaps render them worthy of his more serious
consideration   (June 28).]

1884.]            On the Nervous System      of  the Crinoidea.             75
they differ much more widely both from Asterida and Ophiurida, than
those Orders differ from each other; and while all recent researches
tend to show that Crinoidea are closely allied to Blastoidea and pro
bably to Cystidea, they bring into view their points of difference from
all Echinoderms the aspect of whose months is downward,—a distinc~
tion long since put forward by Leuckart as one of fundamental value.
   It was pointed out nearly twenty years ago by Sir Wyville Thomson
 and myself, that the canalisation or non-canalisation of the calcareous
segments of the Crinoidal skeleton, for the passage of the axial cords,
affords a distinctive character by which its proper radial portion can
 be differentiated from the accessory pieces by which its arrangement
is often complicated and obscured. And the practical value of this
character has been recognised by various students of the extinct
types of the group,—with this modi<U+FB01>cation,                 that among the
Paleocrinoids      the axial cords often lie in grooves which have not
closed-in to form canals, just as          I have shown to be the case in
Antedon     at  a certain  stage   of the development of the radials.     It is
obvious that the morphological value of this character becomes much
greater, if the axial cords are nerve-trunks which call into action the
complicated muscular apparatus of the arms, than if they are to be
regarded (with Ludwig) as merely unconsolidated portions of the
general basis-substance of the calcareous skeleton.
   Another point of interest—Physiological rather than Morphological
——is the existence of a de<U+FB01>nite nervous system, possessed of great
functional activity, which yet shows very little histological differenti
ation.    It can scarcely be doubted, I think, that there is here no de<U+FB01>
nite distinction between ganglionic centres and nerve-trunks; almost
every part of the apparatus being probably capable of originating
as well as of conducting.         The peripheral branches distributed to the
perisome will, of course, be those by which sensory impressions will
be received; while the branches distributed to the muscles will be
those which call forth their motor activity.             But that the axial
cords of the arms are not mere conductors, seems proved by the per
formance of active spontaneous movements by arms which have been
for several days detached from the body. And the connexion of
these cords with each other in the annular commissure and in the                -
quinquelocular centre, would seem to have reference rather to the
co-ordination of actions which would be otherwise independent, than
to a derivation of nerve-power from either of those sources.
   I cannot but think that       I have now given suf<U+FB01>cient reason why the
question    I  have raised should be no longer ignored, but should be
reconsidered in the light of the new facts and arguments              I  have
adduced in support       of  my views.    Those  who  refuse to accept  them,
are bound,      I  think, either to disprove the facts, or to show that

my deductions from them are unsound.          To assert that they are
“
  evidently" erroneous, is clearly an unscienti<U+FB01>c mode of disposing
of them, unworthy of any real lover of truth.

   (June 11.)—I    am permitted by Prof. A. M. Marshall, of Owens Col
lege, to state  that having, during a recent visit to Naples, repeated
for himself at Dr. Dohrn’s Zoological Station the experiments which                    I
performed there in 1876 upon the Nervous System of Antedon Tosacea,
 he found their results con<U+FB01>rmatory of my own in every particular;
whilst he was further led to assign an a<U+FB02>erent as well as a motor
 function to the dorsal nerve-system, as          I
                                              had myself been led to do
by the absence of the ventral nerve in the aboral arms of Actinometrw.
Professor Marshall informs me that he hopes to publish an account
of his experiments in the next number of the Quarterly Journal of
Microscopical Science.
    (June 28.)—I also learn from Prof. Marshall and my Son, that a
further experimental con<U+FB01>rmation of my conclusions has been recently
published by Dr. Carl F.           J
                                 ickeli of Jena<U+FB01>"  Having investigated
the subject four years ago at Trieste, he not only repeated and
veri<U+FB01>ed my experiments, but varied them by the use of electric
stimulation.    He found that when this was applied to the ambu
lacral groove of a detached arm, it produced no effect; but that if
applied. to the axial cord, it called the muscles of the arm and pin
nules into contraction, so as to produce <U+FB01>exure, even though the arm
had previously shown no signs of life. If applied to the axial cord
of a cirrus, electrical stimulation threw the cirrus into tetanic con
traction.   Further, Dr. J. found that while the application of caustic
to the ambulacral groove of an arm had no effect in preventing the
excitation of <U+FB01>exure by electric stimulation of the axial cord, the appli
cation of caustic to the axial cord itself caused a straightening of the
arm and a cessation of its movements, as if by the killing of its nerve.
   These results, says Dr. Jickeli, can be explained in no other mode
than Dr. Carpenter’s; and he further states that his histological
examination of the axial cord has satis<U+FB01>ed him of its nervous character.
   In claiming to be the <U+FB01>rst, after my Son, who has publicly adopted
my view, Dr. J. seems unaware that Professor Perrier has been led
to accept     by his study of the anatomical distribution of the pairs of
             it,
branches given off from the axial cord. (See note, p. 71.)

I.   t‘ On the Structure and Development of the Skull in the
        Mammalia. Part    II:  Edentata.” By W. K. PARKER, F.R.S.
        Received May 26. 1884.
                                (Abstract)
, My former paper        on the structure and development of the
mammalian skull was published in the “ Philosophical Transactions ”
in 1874; it was on that of the Pig.

1884.]                     On the Skull in the Mammalia.                   79
   Since then, whilst gathering fresh and fresh mammalian materials,
the greater part of my actual work has been on the skull of the other
classes.
   There       have been    two   reasons     <U+FB01>rst, the di<U+FB02>iculty of
                                            for this:
obtaining  subjects for dissection, and then the fact that the
mammalian skull is the most dif<U+FB01>cult of interpretation, and asks for
an interpreter who is quite familiar with that of more simple
types.
  Now, I hope to take up Order after Order of this, the highest group
of the Vertebrata.  Of course this will employ me for many years to
come.
   I  would, if it were possible, take the lowest types <U+FB01>rst, namely, the
Monotremes or “ Prototheria,” but this cannot be done.          Even the

little irregularity in the harvesting will not count for much.
   The materials for the present paper have taken me more than
twenty years to collect. Hearty thanks are due to those friends" who
have helped me according to their power.
I     have worked out the skull in several embryos of the Armadillos,
these belong to two genera and three species.
    In the Bradypodidse (Sloths)     have had two stages of the embryo,
                                     I
and two of the young, these belong to two genera and three species.
    In the Anteater (Gyclotarus)      have worked out the skull in two
                                      I
young specimens; in the Pangolins (Manidaa) in an early and a latter
embryo, in the new-born young, and in the adult; and in Oryoteropus
in the nearly ripe embryo.
I     now o<U+FB01>er, in the main paper, the results of this piece of research    ;
this has not been done, however, until much more of the same kind
of work has been either <U+FB01>nished or got well in hand, as               Iam
anxious for the structure of the skull in the various orders to have
become familiar to me for the sake of comparison, expressed or
unexpressed.
I      have come to the conclusion that the Edentata       are nearer of   kin
to the Monotremata than to the Marsupialia, and that            ifthey did,
as indeed they must have done, pass through                aMetatherian, or
Marsupial stage, they did not utilise          but ran through

   is that which makes these forms so abnormal to the morphologist, as
    well as to the zoologist.
        As it happens, the most primitive form of Mammalia existing, the
   Prototheria (Ornithorhynchus and Echidna.) are also abnormal on the
   same account, and thus the best standard, existing, by which to measure
   the height of the platform on which we <U+FB01>nd the Edendata, is not itself
   normal, or straight, or perfect.
       Now none of the Metatheria or Marsupials have suifered from this
   kind of degenerative specialisation; they, therefore, come in well as
   standards of measurement and comparison for the Insectivora, next
   above them, but are of little use here among the Edentata.
       Professor Flo'wer, after working out the general anatomy of this
   group (“ Proc. Z001. $00.,” 1882, pp. 358—367), has come to the
   conclusion that the Edentata of the Old World have little to do with
   those of the New.
       That sounds like a hard saying to one not familiar with the struc
   ture of the group; it did so to me, no long time since, although what
   I  had done at the group, long ago, went to prove the same thing;
   now, however,     I am quite satis<U+FB01>ed of the truth of my friend’s deduc
                                                   -
   tions.
       The Neotropical Edentata hold together much more than might
  have been expected.      The Armadillos are the most isolated ; but much
  as the Aard-Vark of the Cape looks like an archaic Armadillo without
  armour, he is not more than a very distant relative of the modern
   armed Armadillos.
       Indeed, the curious coincidence that     I have found between the
   structure of the Aard-Vark and that of a large Insectivore from a
  contiguous region, namely, the Rhyncncyon from Zanzibar, leads me
  to suspect that the Cape Anteater is an offshoot from the same stock,
  and is, indeed, the only Edentate that can be looked upon as
  probably arising originally from a Metatherian or Marsupial stock,
  like the Insectivora.
       The other Palaeotropical Edentata—the         Pangolins—are   perhaps
  still more isolated than the Aard-Vark, but they have not come so
  near extinction, and are found in more than one continent of the Old
  World.

      If a complete series of fossil types could be found, on one hand
  stretching backwards (or downwards) from the Glyptodons, and on
  the other, from the Megatheroids, then long before these

II. “On         the Non-Euclidian Plane Geometry."   By Professor
                  CAYLEY, F.R.S. Received May 27, 1884.
  1.   I    consider    hyperbolic or Lobatschewskian
                       the                                geometry:
this is a geometry such as that of the imaginary spherical surface
x2+y2+zz= —1; and the imaginary surface may be bent (without
extension or contraction)    into the real surface considered by
Beltrami, and which      I
                       will call the Pseudosphere, viz., this is the
surface of revolution de<U+FB01>ned by the equations 0:: log cot 1,49— cos 6,
  ~/yz—+?= sin 0.   We have on the imaginary spherical surface
 imaginary points corresponding to real points of the pseudosphere,
 and imaginary lines (arcs of great circle) corresponding to real lines
(geodesics)    of the pseudosphere, and, moreover, any two such
 imaginary points or lines of the imaginary spherical surface have a
real distance or inclination equal to the corresponding distance or
inclination on the pseudosphere. Thus the geometry of the pseudo
 sphere, using the expression straight line to denote a geodesic of the
 surface, is the Lobatschewskian geometry ; or rather I would say this
in regard to the metrical geometry, or trigonometry, of the surface;
for in regard to the descriptive geometry, the statement requires (as
will presently appear)       some quali<U+FB01>cation.                .
  2.   Iwould remark that this realisation of the Lobatschewskian
geometry sustains the opinion that Euclid’s twelfth axiom is
undemonstrable.    We may imagine rational beings living in a two
dimensional space, and conceiving of space accordingly, that is
having no conception of a third dimension of space; this two
dimensional space need not however be a plane, and taking it to be
the pseudospherical surface, the geometry to which their experience
would lead them would be the geometry of this surface, that        is,
                                                                   the
Lobatschewskian geometry. With regard to our own two-dimensional
space, the plane,  have, in my Presidential Address (B.A., Southport,
                   I
1883) expressed the opinion that Euclid’s twelfth axiom in Playfair’s
form of    does not need demonstration, but
           it                                   part of our notion of
                                                     is
space, of  the physical space  of our experience; the space, that is,
which we become acquainted with by experience, but which           the
                                                                   is     ,
representation lying at the foundation of all physical experience.
  3. I prepose in the present paper to further develope the geometry
of the pseudosphere.     In regard to the name, and the subject

 1884.]                Non-Euclidian        Plane Geometry.                83
 generally,  I refer to two memoirs by Beltrami, “ Teoria fondamentale
 degli Spazii di Curvatura Costante,” Aunali di Matem., t. ii.
                                          “
 (1868—69),     pp. 232-255, and             Saggio di interpretazione   della
 Geometria non-Euclidea,”          Giornale di Matem., t. vi (1868), pp.
 284—312, both translated, Ann. de I’Ecole Normale, t. vi (1869); in
 the last of these he speaks of surfaces of constant negative curvature as
 “                                                “
   pseudospherical,” and in a later paper, Sulla super<U+FB01>cie di rotazione
 che serve di tipo alle super<U+FB01>cie pseudosferiche,” Gior. di Matem.,
 t. x (1872), pp. 147—151, he treats of the particular surface which
 I have called the pseudosphere. The surface is mentioned, Note iv
 of Liouville’s edition of Monge’s “Application de l’Analyse a la
             "
 Géometrie      (1850), and the generating curve is there spoken of as
 “bien connne des géométres.”
    4. In ordinary plane geometry, take (<U+FB01>g. 1) a line Bar, and on it a
point B; from B, in any direction, draw the line BA; take upon it
a point A, and from this point, at right angles to Baa, draw Ay, cut
ting it at C. We have thus a triangle ACB, right-angled at C;
and we may denote the other angles, and the lengths of the sides,
 by A, B, c, a, b, respectively.       In the construction of the <U+FB01>gure the
length   0 and  the  angle  B  are  arbitrary.
    The plane is a surface which is homogeneous, isotropic, and
palintropic.     That is, whatever he the position of B, the direction of
 Be, and the sense in which the angle B is measured, we have the
same expressions for a, b as functions of c, B; these expressions, of
course, are
                             a=c    cos B, b=csin B.
But considering Ay        as the   initial line, and  AB==c, as a line drawn
from A at an     inclination thereto =A,       we have   in like manner
                             b=ccos A, (1:!) sin A,
and consequently cos      A=   sin B, sin  A:   cos B ; whence sin (A+ B) =1,
                                                                    e 2

 84                  -
                            Prof. Cayley.     ()n the               [June 19,
 cos  (A+B)=0,' and      thence  A+B=a right        angle, or A+B+C=two
 right angles.
    Hence also in any triangle ABC, drawing a perpendicular, say AD
 from' A to the side BC, and so dividing the triangle into two right-_
 angled triangles, we prove that the sum A+B+C of the angles is
 = two right angles, and we further establish the relations
       a=b  cos C+c   cos B,  b=ccosA+acos       C,  c=a  cos B+bcos A,
 which are the fundamental formulae of plane trigonometry; that is,
 we derive the metrical geometry or trigonometry 0f the plane from
the two original equations a=c cos B, b=c sin B.
    5. Supposing the plane bent in any manner, converted that is into a
developable surface or torse, and using the term straight line to
 denote a geodesic of the surface, then the straight line of the surface
is in fact the form assumed, in consequence of the bending, by a
straight line of the plane. The sides and anglespf the rectilinear
triangle ABC on the surface are equal to those of the rectilinear
triangle ABC on the plane, and the metrical relations hold good
without variation.     But it is not simpliciter true that the descriptive
properties of the torse are identical with those of the plane. This
will be the case if the points of the plane and torse have with each
other a (1, l) correspondence, but not otherwise.              For instance,
consider a plane curve (such as the parabola or one branch of the
hyperbola) extending from in<U+FB01>nity to in<U+FB01>nity, and let the torse be
the cylinder having this curve for a plane section;
                                                           then to each point
of the plane their corresponds a single point of the cylinder; and
conversely to each point of the cylinder there corresponds a single
point of the plane; and the descriptive geometries are identical.          In
particular  two straight lines (geodesics) on the cylinder cannot inclose
a space; and Euclid’s twelfth axiom holds good in regard to the
straight lines (geodesics) of the cylinder.      But take the plane curve
to be a closed curve, or (to <U+FB01>x the ideas) a circle ; the in<U+FB01>nite plane is
bent into a cylinder considered as composed               of an in<U+FB01>nity of
convolutions; to each point of the plane there corresponds a single
point of the cylinder, but to each point of the cylinder an in<U+FB01>nity of
points of the plane; and the descriptive properties are in this case
altered; the straight lines (geodesics) of the cylinder are helices; and
we can through two given points of the cylinder draw, not only one,
but an in<U+FB01>nity of helices; any two of these will inclose a space.
And even if instead of the geodesics we consider only the shortest
lines, or helices of greatest inclination; yet even here for a pair of
points on opposite generating lines of the cylinder, there are two
helices of equal inclination, that is, two shortest lines inclosing a
space.   We have in what precedes an illustration in regard to the
descriptive geometry of the pseudosphere; this is not identical with

  1884.]               Non-Euclidian           Plane Geometry.                    85
 the Lobatschewskian geometry, but corresponds to it in a manner
 such as that in which the geometry of the surface of the circular
 Cylinder corresponds to that of the plane.
    6. The surface- of the sphere is, like the plane, homogeneous,
 isotropic, and palintropic.        We may on the spherical surface construct
 as above a_.right-ang1ed       triangle ABC, whereinthe side a and the
 angle B are arbitrary; and (corresponding to the before-mentioned.
 formulae for the plane)v we then have                          -
                    tan a=tan      0  cos   B,    sin b=sin       a  sin B,
                                                   ‘
 whence also
                    tan b=tan      0  cos  A,  .  sin a=sin       a  sin A.
 We   deduce from these
                     i

 giving                  cos a cos b=c0s90 tan             A tan B    ;
 that is             tan A tan B=—1—                     , which is >      1.
                                         cos a cos     b
 Hence A+B>a right angle, or in the right-angled trangle ACB,
 the sum A+B+C of the angles is >two right angles. Whence
also in any triangle ABC whatever, dividing it into two right
angled triangles by means of a perpendicular let fall from an angle
on the opposite side, we have the sum A—l-B+C of the angles
 >two right angles.       And we obtain, moreover,
                 a='tan_1(tan        0  cos B) +tan_1(tan          b  cos   C),
                 b=tan-1(tan a cos C) +tan-1 (tan                   0   cos A),
                  c=tan-1(tan        1; cos
                                             A) +tan-1(tan           a cos    B),
which lead to all the formulas of spherical trigonometry.
   7. Suppose the radius of the sphere to be l/X: then a, b, a being
the lengths of the sides, the lengths in spherical measure are Aa, Ab, M ;
and we must in the formulae instead of a, b, a write ha, Rb, M respec
tively.   In particular for the imaginary sphere m2+y2'+z9=—l, we
have 7t=i, and we must instead of a, b, a write ai, bi, 015 respectively.
The fundamental formulae for the right-angled triangle thus become
                tanh a=tanh        0   cos B, sinh         b=sinh     s  sin B,

and these lead to all the trigonometrical formulae, viz., any one of
these is deduced from the corresponding formula of spherical trigo

the corresponding hyperbolic functions.

such triangle ABC on the imaginary sphere, and the lines BC, CA, AB
which connect them, are imaginary: the meaning of the proof will
better appear on passing to the pseudosphere.

it necessary to give the direct veri<U+FB01>cation of these equations for a
more general position of the right-angled triangle: we already know,

viz., this is the case when bending is allowed; in other words, the
surface is applicable upon itself, with three degrees of. freedom ; con
sidering any in<U+FB01>nitesimal linear element Am, the point A may be
brought to coincide with an arbitrary point A' of the surface, with
the element Am in an arbitrary direction A'az' through A', and the
area about A will then coincide with the area about A'.     The analy

meridian section the curve m=log cotéG—cos 0, y=sin 0. This is a
curve symmetrical in regard to the axis of y; and we obtain the
portion of it lying on the positive side of this axis, by giving to 0 the
series of values 9:0 to 0:90°; for 6:0, we have y=O, 40:00, or

 mining on the unit-circle a point belonging to the angle x=57° 31';
at this point we draw parallel to the tangent a line which is the
 tangent at the lowest point; the curve passes through the point 90°
on the unit-circle, and there cuts the circle at the angle |c= 57° 31'
 (or, what is the same thing, the radius at the complementary angle),
and we have thus the tangent at the point 90° of the unit-circle; it
 will be noticed that this meets the tangent at the apse at a point
 near to this apse, so that the are as determined by the two tangents is
 for a large part of its course nearly a right line; this is still more the
case for smaller values of (to or x, while for larger values the devia
tion increases, but in the neighbourhood of the unit-circle the form
 is always nearly rectilinear.

    24. The curves shown in the <U+FB01>gure are projections upon the plane
of the unit-circle, viz., they are the projections on this plane of the
geodesics, which cut at right angles a given meridian; but bearing in
mind the form of the meridian, it is easy, by means of the projection,
to understand the actual forms on the surface of the pseudosphere.
A point near the centre of the <U+FB01>gure represents a point high up on
the surface; and in any radius the portions near the centre are the
more foreshortened in the <U+FB01>gure, and represent greater distances on
the surface. Each geodesic cutting the meridian at right angles
at the apse descends symmetrically on the two sides, reaches ulti
mately—it may be after many convolutions—the unit-circle; the
meridian itself is a limiting or special form of geodesic.         The unit
circle is not properly a geodesic, but it is an envelope of geodesics.
    25. To obtain all the geodesics we have to consider the geodesics
Which cut at right angles a given meridian; and then to imagine this
meridian (with the geodesics which belong to it) turned round so as
to occupy successively the positions of all the other meridians.         The
same remark applies of course to the projections; the <U+FB01>gure shows
the projections cutting at right angles a given radius of the circle;
and this radius (with the projections belonging to it) is then to be
turned round so as to occupy successively the positions of all the
other radii.     We may imagine the several geodesics turned round
separately, each through.a different angle, so as to bring each of
                                                                H 2

then the geodesics drawn in all directions through this point of the
surface; doing the same thing with the projections, we have, it is
clear, the projections of the geodesics drawn in all directions through
the point. It is easy, by drawing the projections each on a separate
circle of paper, and passing a pin through the centres, to form a
model by means of which an accurate <U+FB01>gure of the projection may be
constructed.         I
                 But content myself with a mere diagram (<U+FB01>g. 4).

    26. Taking a point Q       so low    down on the surface that the
geodesic   at right angles to  the meridian   through Q is a simple arc
A'A, then imagining the two extremities A, A’ each moving in
the same sense round the circle, but A faster than A', so as to assume
the positions B, B’; C, C'; and so on to K, K’ coinciding with each
 other, we have the arcs B'B, 0'0, and so on until we come to the loop
 form K'K: after which we have L’ in advance of L, and so on to
curves of any number of convolutions.         Considering any two arcs—
B’B, C'C—and drawing the geodesic BC which joins their extre
 mities B and C. then any geodesic through Q intermediate to B’B,
 C’C, or, say, to QB, QC, will meet the arc BC ; while the geodesics
through Q extramediate to QB, QC will not meet, or will only after a.
 convolution or convolutions meet, the arc BC.      This of course corre
 sponds   to the  Lobatschewskian    theory, according to which we have
 through a point Q to     the extremities at in<U+FB01>nity of a line BC, two
 distinct lines QB, QC, said to be the parallels through Q of the line
 BC; and which are such that any line through Q intermediate to

 III.   “ The Proteids of Serum.” By W. D. HALLIBURTON, M.B.,
        B.Sc., Sharpey Physiological Scholar.                Communicated by
        Professor SOHAFER, F .R.S. (From the Physiological Labo
        ratory, University College, London.)                Received May 28,

                             (Preliminary Notice.)
    The investigation of which this paper gives a brief summary
 relates to serum-albumin rather than to serum-globulin, and the
experiments may be arranged in two categories: <U+FB01>rst, those relating
 to heat-coagulation;      and secondly, those relating to the action of
certain salts upon the proteids of blood-serum.
    The apparatus used for the determination of the temperature of the
heat-coagulation of proteids was not that which has been usually
employed for the purpose, and which consists of two beakers contain
ing water, one within the other, and heated gradually over a sand

 bath ;' the substance under investigation being placed in a test-tube
 contained within the inner beaker! The chief objection to that
 method is that the rise of temperature in the water in the beakers
 takes place with extreme slowness, so that changes are apt to occur in
 the proteid during the experiment.           To meet this difficulty an
 apparatus was devised by Professor Schafer, which was found to be
 extremely easy to use, and of which the great advantage consists in
 the readiness with which a constant temperature is maintained for a
 considerable time. It may be brie<U+FB02>y described thus: the liquid of
 which one wishes to determine the temperature of coagulation is
 placed in a test-tube in suf<U+FB01>cient quantity to cover the bulb of a
 thermometer put into it; the test-tube is placed in the neck of a
 <U+FB02>ask containing water; this water is kept at the desired temperature
by the following means.       It is in the <U+FB01>rst place kept constantly
 running, entering by one tube and leaving the <U+FB02>ask by another tube
inserted as a T-piece in the upper part of the neck. The water is
warmed by passing it through a coil of tubing contained in a vessel
in which water is kept constantly boiling. By regulating the rate at
 which the water <U+FB02>ows through this apparatus the desired temperature
is maintained.
    The temperature of coagulation of serum-globulin is stated to be
 75° C., and that of serum-albumin as 73° C.         But it was found that
after heating serum to the higher of these two temperatures, and
<U+FB01>ltering off the coagulnm, that the <U+FB01>ltrate still contained a large
amount of proteid, which coagulated at a temperature higher than
75° C.
    A  method of fractional heat-coagulation was therefore adopted.
A   specimen of serum was taken, and heated until a. <U+FB02>occulent preci
pitate appeared; this was <U+FB01>ltered off, and the <U+FB01>ltrate again heated
until another deposit took place ; this was repeated until the <U+FB01>ltrate
gave no evidence of the presence of proteid. In order to obtain these
precipitates it was necessary to render the liquid faintly acid ; if this
is not done alkali-albumin is formed, which will not coagulate.       It is
also necessary to render faintly acid each <U+FB01>ltrate, as after the separa
tion from it of a precipitate, a. faintly acid liquid becomes neutral, or
faintly alkaline. Acetic acid was the acid used for this purpose in
most instances.
    By this means it was found that the albumin of serum can be
differentiated into three different proteids, which coagulate at the
temperatures of 73° 0., 77° 0., and’84i° C. These temperatures vary
within certain limits, the presence of excess of certain salts to be
afterwards noted raising or lowering the temperature somewhat; and
it is found that the amount of acid present has a very marked effect

 in altering the temperature up to a certain limit, the greater the
 excess of acid present the lower being the temperature of coagulation.
 A series of experiments to de<U+FB01>ne precisely what this relation is is at
 present    in progress.       The serum of several animals has been
 examined, viz., the ox, sheep, horse, dog, rabbit, pig, cat, monkey,
 man.     The plasma of two of these animals, viz., the dog and monkey,
 were also examined, and gave con<U+FB01>rmatory results.
    The experiments relating to the plasma and serum of the dog will
 now be detailed at greater length, as an illustration of the method
 used.
    1. A  portion of plasma, prevented from coagulating by the addition
 of sodium sulphate,      was rendered faintly acid, and at the following
 points coagulation     occurred  :—
    56° C.    White <U+FB02>occulent precipitate; <U+FB01>ltered off; <U+FB01>ltrate faintly
                 alkaline ; it was rendered faintly acid, and heated to—
    73°  C., when a dense <U+FB01>occulent precipitate occurred. This was
                 <U+FB01>ltered off; the <U+FB01>ltrate, again alkaline, was rendered
                 acid, and heated to—
    75° C.,   when a small amount of a <U+FB01>nely divided precipitate
                 occurred; from the <U+FB01>ltrate, after this always rendered
                 faintly acid, coagula separated at—
    77° C. and—
    82° C. After <U+FB01>ltering off this last precipitate, the <U+FB01>ltrate was found
               to be free from proteid. -
   2.  A portion of plasma       was saturated with powdered magnesium
sulphate; a precipitate        was so obtained which Hammarsten         has
shown to consist of globulin.         This was <U+FB01>ltered off, and the <U+FB01>ltrate
then treated as the original plasma; at the points 73° C., 77° C., and
82° C., white <U+FB01>occulent precipitates were found to occur.         The preci
pitate caused by magnesium sulphate was washed with saturated
solution of magnesium sulphate, and then dissolved by adding distilled
water.     An opalescent solution was so obtained, and by the process
of fractional heat-coagulation precipitates were found to occur at
56° and 75" ; the <U+FB01>ltrate after the latter containing no proteid.
   3. After heating another portion of plasma to 75° C., and <U+FB01>ltering
off the coagulum, magnesium sulphate produced no precipitate,
showing that all the globulins went down at or below 75° C.
   4. With the serum of the same animal, the dog, treated in a similar
manner, the following are the points at which coagula appeared:
70°, 75°, 77°, and ESQ—83°.
   5. With another portion of serum, to which saturated solution of
sodium Sulphate had been added, in the same proportions in which it
had been added to the plasma to prevent coagulation, the points at
which coagula fell were 73°, 75°, 77°, and 83°.

   6. Another portion was saturated with magnesium sulphate, and
the resulting precipitate <U+FB01>ltered off; the <U+FB01>ltrate gave precipitates at
73°, 77°, and 83°.    The precipitate produced by magnesium sulphate
after being washed and dissolved was found to coagulate entirely
at 75° C.
   Thus it is the albumin of serum and not the globulin which is thus
di<U+FB01>erentiated by heat-coagulation into three several proteids with
diiferent temperatures of heat-coagulation.
   Results similar to these, the points varying a degree or two in
various cases, were obtained from the serum of the cat, monkey,
rabbit, pig, and man.    In most instances the blood of several of each
of these animals was examined. In one specimen of monkey’s serum
no coagulum occurred after 77° ; the total amount of proteids in this
specimen was, however, very small. In one or two instances a fourth
coagulum at 87—88” was found to occur, but this was quite excep
tional.
   In addition to examining the blood-serum of man, the various
so-called serous effusions have been submitted to similar analysis.
For these  I   am indebted to Dr. Henry Maudsley, Resident Medical
Of<U+FB01>cer, University College Hospital, and to others of the resident
sta<U+FB01> there. It may be brie<U+FB02>y stated that all gave similar results,
viz., that by a process of fractional heat-coagulation the albumin of
serum can be differentiated into three separate proteids. The <U+FB02>uids
examined have been hydrocele <U+FB02>uid, pleuritic <U+FB02>uid, ascitic <U+FB02>uid, and
parovarian <U+FB02>uid.
   Is alkali-albumin a constant constituent of the blood-serum? In
one or two instances neutralisation produced a faint cloudiness, but
as a rule it did not.   After dilution, neutralisation of the serum was
found invariably to produce a precipitate; excess of acid up to a
certain point increased this, then dissolved it; on collecting this
precipitate and examining   it,
                              it   was found to be serum-globulin.
   On making some alkali-albumin arti<U+FB01>cially from egg-albumin,        it
was found that magnesium sulphate precipitates it completely, in the
same way that that salt precipitates         serum-globulin.    If alkali
albumin  is  present in serum,it  will therefore be precipitated with the
globulin, when the serum      is   shaken with powdered magnesium
sulphate.    This precipitate, however, was found when redissolved to
coagulate entirely at 75°, and <U+FB01>ltering off the coagulum the <U+FB01>ltrate
showed no evidence of proteid.
   The blood of the sheep, ox, and horse was found to differ from
those just described, as in them the serum-albumin can only be
differentiated into two proteids by the process of fractional heat
coagulation; the points at which precipitation occurs being 77° C.
and 84° C.
   The albumins of serum having thus been shown to be more numer

ous      than has hitherto been supposed, my next object was to <U+FB01>nd
 some distinction       between these varieties of serum-albumin other than
that of heat-coagulation.           It must, however, be remembered that the
 mere difference of temperature of coagulation is an important one;
in fact, one of the chief differences between <U+FB01>brinogen and serum
globulin is that the former coagulates at 56° C. and the latter at
 75° C., and yet the function of these two bodies is vastly different.
In the want of knowledge of the chemical constitution of the proteids,
one has to be content at present with mere physical properties.
     My object, however, was to <U+FB01>nd certain salts which would precipi
tate these varieties of serum-albumin.                In the same way that Ham
marsten discovered that magnesium sulphate will precipitate serum
globulin from serum, and will precipitate nothing else, so it was
hoped that certain other salts would precipitate one variety, and that
one only, of serum-albumin.
                         I
  I
     On this point          am at present still engaged.         A large number of
salts     have  been   examined,   and   these experiments constitute the second
category spoken of at the commencement of this paper.
     The most important result obtained has been with sodium sulphate.
     When sodium sulphate is added to saturation and in excess to
serum, and shaken for many hours, no precipitate occurs.
     When magnesium sulphate is used a dense precipitate occurs; this
is <U+FB01>ltered off, and then the <U+FB01>ltrate is saturated with sodium sulphate;
another dense precipitate occurs? If the <U+FB01>ltrate saturated with
magnesium sulphate be shaken with sodium sulphate in excess for
eight or nine hours, the serum-albumin is found to be completely
precipitated; and the <U+FB01>ltrate is found to be absolutely free                '
                                                                                  from
proteid, and is clear and colourless.1'
     If this precipitate be washed with water saturated with magnesium
sulphate and sodium sulphate, and then dissolved by adding water,
the resulting solution will be found to contain proteid, which can
again be separated by heat-coagulation in the way previously stated.
     This experiment has been performed with sheep’s serum, and has
been con<U+FB01>rmed on rabbit’s serum.
     Potassium acetate was found to act similarly to sodium sulphate;
adding it to saturation to serum already saturated with magnesium
sulphate produced complete precipitation of all forms of serum
albumin.        Potassium acetate differs from sodium sulphate in also
producing a precipitate in simple serum. Here it precipitates both
globulin and serum-albumin.              It thus resembles in its action potas
sium carbonate, which is known to precipitate all the proteids.
Potassium acetate is a dif<U+FB01>cult salt to work with, as it deliquesces in
    * Schafer, “Journal of Physiology,” vol. iii, pp. 181—187.
    1‘ I  have since ascertained that if serum is saturated with the double sulphate of
sodium and magnesium, all the proteids are quickly and completely precipitated.

the air, and is so soluble that a vast amount of it is required to
saturate even a small quantity of serum.
   Various other salts have been examined. Many that are not very
soluble produce no e<U+FB01>ect at all; among these may be mentioned
potassium nitrate, potassium sulphate, potassium chloride, potassium
chlorate, ammonium chloride.
   Others, like sodium chloride and sodium nitrate, precipitate
globulin completely, but slowly, in simple serum. Sodium nitrate
precipitates serum-albumin completely, but slowly, after saturation
with magnesium sulphate.
     Sodium  nitrate has a very marked effect in lowering the heat
coagulation of a proteid.       Potassium nitrate acts similarly, but not
nearly to so great an extent as sodium nitrate.
    Fuller particulars concerning these various salts will be given
when the experiments relating to them are completed.
   The most important results that these researches show are as
follows :—             .
    (1.) That   the albumin    of serum can by the process of fractional
heat-coagulation    be   shown to consist of three separate proteids, which
may be called provisionally serum-albumin numbers 1, 2, and. 3 (to
avoid a multiplicity of terms).      In certain animals only two of these
are present.
    (2.) That the precipitates described by Fredericq as occurring in
serum at temperatures below 700 C. have, in this series of experi
ments, in which some hundreds of heat-coagulation determinations
have been made, been found never to occur.
         That the albumins of serum can be completely precipitated
after saturation with magnesium sulphate and removal of the serum
globulin by saturation with sodium sulphate.
   (4.) That potassium acetate, added in excess to solution of a.
proteid, e.g., serum or solution of egg-albumin, completely precipitates
the proteid therefrom without coagulating it.

108             Mr. H. Tomlinson.            The In<U+FB02>uence of         [June     19,
experiments on moduli of elasticity and electrical conductivity
described in Parts I and        II
                                of this paper“ was determined in the
following   manner   :—The   wires,  which had been previously well
annealed, were wound round a steel rod and so made into coils of
length about 2 inches, inner diameter      inch, and outer diameter
                                                 5,1                            12
inches, the rod was then withdrawn and the coil inserted into a thin
brass envelope.   The envelope consisted of a hollow cylinder     inches
                                                                      2
in length and inches in diameter, terminated at both ends by a trun
              2
cated cone. One of the conical ends was closed and could be unscrewed
so as to receive the coil of wire, and was, after the insertion of the
coil, screwed on again. At the other extremity of the envelope was
an aperture g   inch in diameter, through which a thermometer could
be inserted, so that its bulb would lie along the axis and in the centre
of the coil of wire.    The brass envelope and the contained coil were
heated    in an air-chamber consisting of two concentric copper
cylinders of equal length connected at their two ends, so as to enclose
between them a layer of water       inch thick.
                                     é            The length of the air
chamber thus formed was 14 inches, and the inner diameter 2;} inches,
80 that the envelope could freely slide through the chamber.         The
two ends of the air-chamber, which was placed in a horizontal
position, were closed by corks, through the centre of one of which
passed a thermometer, and through a very small hole in the centre of
the other was drawn        a<U+FB01>ne but strong thread attached with one
extremity to the envelope, and with the other wound round a little
piece of wood which prevented the thread from being dragged
through the hole when the former was drawn tight.          The envelope
and contained wire were heated before immersion in the water of the
calorimeter in one set of experiments to about 60° C., and in another
set to about 100° C.     The envelope served a double purpose, as    not  it
only enabled compensation to be made for loss of heat during the
transference of the wire from the air-chamber to the calorimeter, but
also was of use in distributing the heat uniformly throughout the
coil.
   Preliminary observations were made for the purpose of ascertaining
the rise of temperature which would be caused by immersing the
heated envelope only in the water of the calorimeter.
   Every precaution was taken both with regard to the instruments
themselves   and the mode of using them to avoid error, and the
formulae given below may be received with great con<U+FB01>dence.
   It will be seen that the thermal capacity of all the metals
examined increased with the temperature, a result which we <U+FB01>nd
con<U+FB01>rmed by the observations of other investigators.
   The thermal capacities of the alloys platinum-silver, and German
silver are, within the limits of error, exactly the same as those

  or that the cube of “ Young’s Modulus ” varies as the seventh power
  of the thermal capacity per unit volume. This relation was found to
  hold approximately not merely for the metals here examined, but also
  in the case of a great many substances for which the values of C, and e
  have been determined by other investigators.
      Still more approximately is it believed that this relation would
                                               ”
  hold good if for “ Young’s Modulus              the bulk-modulus of elasticity
  were substituted.        Denoting the bulk-modulus by e,, it was found
  that, within the wide limits of error to which determinations of the
  value of the bulk-modulus are liable to be a<U+FB01>'ected
                                    0,, _-a constant.

  Neither of the above relations can be true for all temperatures,
  inasmuch as whilst the value of e, diminishes with rise of temperature,
  that of C, increases, but at ordinary temperatures it seems that the
  bulk-modulus of elasticity in grammes per square centimetre can be
  calculated from the thermal capacity per unit volume by the formula—
                                   e,=2071 X 1060,;
      The thermal capacity per unit volume increases with the tempera
  ture, and the researches of Matthiessen, Fizeau, and others on the
  one hand,_and of Kohlrausch on the other, have shown that there is a
  like increment in the thermal expansibility and torsionability" of
  metals. A careful comparison was made of the various increments
  above mentioned, and it is shown in the paper that whilst the ratio
  of increase per unit of expansibility with rise of temperature to
  corresponding value in the case of torsionabilityf is, within the
  limits of error of observation, unity, that in which thermal
  expansibility and thermal capacity are concerned is about two, so
  that the rate at which thermal expansibility increases with the
  temperature is about twice the rate at which thermal capacity increases.
  The rate of increase of both thermal expansibility and thermal capacity
  varies with the nature of the metal, being greatest for iron and least
  for platinum.

  capacity will be independent of the temperature.                     If the‘“ real

knowledge of the rate of increase of the “ variable thermal capacity ”
determine the expansibility at any temperature between two limits,

<U+FB01>fths of the whole thermal energy which we may impart to a mass of
metal goes towards raising the temperature, the remaining three
<U+FB01>fths being expended in internal and external work.          The external
work  is   practically insensible in ordinary cases.     Of the internal
work, that expended against bulk-elasticity amounts in the limiting
cases from “+05 to T6500 of the whole, and, though greater than the
external work, is almost insensible; moreover, there seems to be no
relationship whatever between the whole thermal capacity per unit

  e<U+FB01>ects of longitudinal stress on     a wire is to be found by dividing the
 theoretical   thermal e<U+FB01>ects   by 1'61, since part of the work expended

     In the “Phil. Trans.” for   1673, No. 97, among the    “Acta Medica ”
 of Dr. Bartholin,     the twelfth is thus stated :—
      “A  contrivance of making water not boyl in the midst of boyliug
 water, by hanging a narrow-mouth’d glass, half-full of water, in the
 midst of an Iron Kettle <U+FB01>lled with water; whereupon the ambient
 water may by a strong <U+FB01>re be made to boyl, when as the water in the
 glass, though it be hot, yet will not boyl at all, though some few
 bubbles be seen at the bottom, which do all vanish before they come
 to the top.”
     In “ Rozier’s Journal” for 1773, p. 1, is a memoir entitled
 “
    Experiences et Phénoménes singuliers sur la Communication de la
 Chaleur, par M. Braun, de l’Académie de St. Pétersbourg.”           In this
 memoir, reference is made to a paper by Olaus Borrichius in the
 “ Memoirs of the
                      Academy of Copenhagen,” entitled “Aqua in medio
 aquee non ebulliens.”
     In M. Braun’s experiments, a copper vessel was <U+FB01>lled with water,
and another copper vessel, containing water to the height of two
thirds, was placed in it, so that the level of the water in the outer
vessel was above that in the inner.         The water in the outer vessrl
was made to boil violently during upwards of an hour, and the
waterin the small vessel did not show the least sign of ebullition.
It remained in fact 9° (De Lisle’s ther.) below the temperature of the
water in the outer vessel.
     The experiment was also tried in vessels of glass, earthenware,
iron, &c., with the same result. Also with different liquids, such as
spirits of wine of various densities, contained in both vessels, when
the temperature of the liquid in the smaller vessel was from 4° to 12°
or 13° below that in the outer vessel.        With various kinds of wine,
the difference was 4° or 5°; with milk 7 °; and with petroleum from
15° to 20°.        These results, the author remarks, form a strange
paradox, but may possibly be referred to the fact that the outer vessel
is immediately in contact with the source of heat.

boiling water.    A common bottle is <U+FB01>lled with water, and placed in a
pan of water so that the mouth of the bottle be a little above the
water in the pan.     The pan is set on the <U+FB01>re, and its contents made
to boil violently at 212° F., while the water in the bottle will only
reach 202°.”
   In repeating this experiment,      I used for the outer vessel a large
wide-mouthed <U+FB02>ask <U+FB01>lled about two-thirds with water, heated by
                                                                              "
means of a spirit lamp;         and for the inner vessel a glass tube,
suspended by means of      a string attached to the top ring of the retort
stand which supported the <U+FB02>ask.          In this way the tube could be
raised or lowered so as to place the level of the water contained in it
above or below the level of the water in the <U+FB02>ask.
   The experiment, under this form, has been frequently repeated, and
it was found that, in general, after the water in the <U+FB02>ask had been
boiling for some time, the temperature of the water in the tube was
not more than    I?  or 2° F. below that in the outer vessel.
   The inferior temperature of the water in the tube is evidently due
to evaporation; and as there were no very clear ideas on this subject
until the time of Dalton, the early observers regarded the result as
paradoxical.
   On covering the water in the tube with a layer of oil, the tempera
ture rose to that of the water in the <U+FB02>ask, and bubbles of steam
escaped freely from the surface of the water through the oil.
   The oil used was olive in one case, and a volatile oil of high
boiling point, such as cajupnt, in another. On passing the thermo
meter through the oil down into the tube, bubbles of steam were
given off freely from the bulb and stem, thus further illustrating one
of the points maintained in my paper on the action of nuclei in
liberating vapour from boiling liquids, contained in the ' “Proceedings
of the Royal Society,” vol. 17, p. 240.

   In regard to these two important .volcanic mountains of the
Ecuadorian Andes, Mr. Whymper has favoured me with some de
scriptive nores, which appear to me of so much interest that         I incor.
porate them   with  but  slight  modi<U+FB01>cation   into  my paper.

                                     Cotopaxi.
   “ Two   volcanoes   in Ecuador—Sangai and Cotopaxi—are         always in
a state of activity, and, of these two. the latter is the higher and the
more important mountain.           Cotopaxi, according to my observations
with mercurial barometer on its summit, is 19,650 feet high, and it is
the second in altitude of the Andes of Ecuador, being inferior only to
Chimborazo.                                                       _
   “It is situated approximately north-east of Chimborazo at a
distance of 65 miles, and lies south-east of Quito at a distance of about
32 miles.      It is nearly due east of the Tiupullo ridge (11,550) over
which the road to Quito passes, and few mountains look so imposing
as it does from this direction—the atmosphere of smoke and haze
which is always hanging about it, subduing its details without con
cealing its general contour, produces an e<U+FB01>ect of stupendous size and
enormous height.
   “ The volcano proper, as regards its north, west, and southern sides,
may be considered to rise from a plateau, which is elevated about
11,500 feet abovevthe sea.         I have only seen the eastern side from
considerable distances, and, as well as I can judge, the mountain
would appear to reach a lower level on the east than upon any other
side. No houses are, so far as I am aware, situated within 10 miles
of the crater—the nearest, on the west, being at Santa Ana ([0,335)
on the Quito road; on the south-west by west at the village of Mulalo
 (10,036); and on the north-north-west at the hamlet of Pedregal
 (11,628).
   “ To judge correctly of the general form of this volcano, it is neces
sary to view it at a considerable distance.        At 15 miles, or further
away, the upper 8,000 or 9,000 feet present the appearance of a very
regular and slightly blunted cone.         As the longer axis of the crater
has a northerly and southerly direction, the mountain looks sharper
when viewed from the north and south than it does when seen from
the west.       The symmetrical appearance of the volcano diminishes
considerably upon a near approach, as its slopes are extremely rugged,
and its subordinate features acquire undue importance through the
e<U+FB01>ect of foreshortening.         Although much snow falls upon the upper
4,000 or 5,000 feet of the mountain it seldom wears a snowy aspect,
through the ash which is continually being ejected quickly blackening
it, and from rapid liquefaction, owing to the warmth of the cone.
   “ With the view of inspecting the interior of the crater (respecting
which apparently contradictory accounts had been given by those
who had previously ascended the mountain), I proposed to encamp
close to the summit, in order that we might see the crater by night.
 The <U+FB01>rst day’s march took us from the town of Machachi (9,850) to
the hamlet of Pedregal (11,628), and the second day to the lower

slopes of the mountain, where we encamped, on its west-north-west
side, at the height of 15,100 feet.       Bad weather for two days pre
vented the establishment of a camp upon the summit, but on Feb
ruary 18, 1880, a tent was placed on the western side of the terminal
cone, on the outside, about 130 feet below the highest point.           The
slope  was  entirely composed of  ash,  piled  up almost  to the maximum
angle at which it could repose, and it was necessary to cut deeply into
it to obtain a su<U+FB01>iciently secure platform.          A maximum thermo
meter placed on the <U+FB02>oor of the tent rose to 110° F., and water boiled
at 179°.    The exterior temperature at the same time ranged from 15°
to 20° F.
   “Our <U+FB01>rst (and lower) camp was made on the side of one of the
numerous lava" streams which are found on the west of the mountain,
and the tent was pitched upon beds of ash, which extended consider
ably lower down than our position.       The volcano, although in a state
of activity, was not in eruption.      Explosions or violent noises were
frequently heard in the bowels of the mountain, resembling such
 sounds as may be produced by slamming doors at the ends of long
passages in a large building.       They caused scarcely any tremour.
 On the way up, when about 1,500 feet below the summit, we were
incommoded by puffs of strongly sulphurous vapour, proceeding appa
rently from <U+FB01>ssures in the cone; but when encamped upon the
summit, during a stay of twenty-six hours, we neither heard such
noises as those referred to, nor were we in any way inconvenienced
by the vapours proceeding from the crater.
    “ Steam and smoke were continually issuing from the crater and
 simmering over the edge, but we heard no extraordinarily loud noises,
 and for some hours devoted our whole attention to <U+FB01>rmly establishing
the tent, which was a matter of no little dif<U+FB01>culty, owing to the
unstable nature of our platform and the high wind which prevailed.
The mountain, according to the general testimony of the natives in
the neighbourhood, had been unusually quiet for some time past.          As
this calm might be interrupted at any moment, I directed my people
that, in the event of an eruption, everything was to be abandoned,
and each was to shift for himself as best he could.
    “ When our tent was well secured, we went up to the
                                                                edge of the
rim to inspect the interior.    Little could be seen of                it,
                                                               even of the
part immediately underneath us. The rock of the rim was a compact
and very tough and heavy trachyte              (a
                                            specimen     described below),
                                                                  is
and the immediate summit of the rim was everywhere jagged and irre
gular.    Some points upon     rose 100 to 150 feet above the general
                              it

the rim at any one moment, but we made the circuit of about one

 third of the crater, and gradually inspected the whole of it            as the
 wind shifted the smoke hither and thither.
     “ On the <U+FB01>rst occasion that
                                    we mounted to the edge of the rim, we
 had been standing there only a few minutes, when a loud roar
 occurred at the bottom of the crater, and volumes of steam were
 ejected, which rose to our level in two or three seconds, spread out in
 vast clouds, and were gradually dissipated. “Te looked at each other
 with alarm, not knowing what was going to happen.               We probably
 all thought alike—that an eruption was about to occur, and that we
 had best run for our lives. As quiet reigned again, we remained, and
 found that such explosions occurred about every half-hour during our
 stay on the summit.       The vapour ejected appeared to be pure steam,
 and it appeared to issue from the (roughly) circular ori<U+FB01>ce at the
 bottom of the crater. It rose with great rapidity, taking,            I think,
 not more than two to three seconds to rise the 1,200 feet from the
 bottom of the crater to the level of the rim. When it reached us it
 could not be said even to be warm, and it was quite devoid of
 odour. The explosions were momentary—the a<U+FB01>air of an instant
 -—and during the instants of their occurrence the noise resembled
that which is made when large ocean steamers are blowing off steam.
    “ In course of time, as eddies of wind
                                               shifted the vapour in the crater
from one to another part, we gradually made out its general form and
nature. Its form above is roughly oval, and at the bottom rudely
 circular.    The general angle from the edge of the rim to the bottom
 exceeds 45°.      The mean of a great number of observations would
 perhaps be about 48°.       At no part is there a continuous slope from
top to bottom. The amphitheatre is made up of a large number of
cliffs (often vertical, and even overhanging), and of slopes of all
degrees.     This character continues all the way down. The upper part
was not noticeably <U+FB01>ssured, but from about half-way down, down to
the bottom, cracks and <U+FB01>ssures were numerous; and from these aper
tures vapours of various tints were lazily issuing—some white, greyish,
or dark, but none were inky black.               These vapours perpetually
obscured the inferior part of the crater, the in<U+FB02>uence of the wind not
being felt so low down. From this cause,           I am unable to state posi
tively   from    what part  the  ejections  of  steam   occurred which have
been referred to above.
    “ In the
              evening of February 18th, when it became dark,           I  went
again to the edge of the crater to view the interior.             Less smoke
appeared to be issuing from the cracks at the bottom, and it did not
now prevent the examination of any part. The <U+FB01>ssures for several
hundreds of. feet from the extreme bottom of the crater were now
radiant with heat, and the lowest part was occupied by a circular,
glowing, <U+FB01>ery spot, which         I  estimated to be 180 feet across, or
about one-tenth of the entire diameter of the crater.             I examined

1125                     Prof. T. G. Bouncy.     0n  the        [June 19,
 this a  long time attentively with an excellent <U+FB01>eld-glass, without being
able to determine whether this      spot- represented the upper end of a
 pipe <U+FB01>lled with molten lava, or whether it was only incandescent
 matter. Flames were <U+FB02>ickering and travelling about it in all direc
tions.     I  compare the appearance they presented to that seen when a
<U+FB02>at dish is half covered with lighted spirit. The <U+FB02>ames that        I  saw
travelled to and fro in the same peculiar manner. Besides the <U+FB02>ames
which were at the surface of the ori<U+FB01>ce or pipe of the crater, there
 were others in many places <U+FB02>ickering over the glowing <U+FB01>ssures. The
appearance and behaviour of these <U+FB02>ames gave me the impression that
there was a comparatively tranquil atmosphere at the bottom; any
how there was nothing that suggested the existence of strong blasts
issuing from the <U+FB01>ssures.
    “After spending a considerable "time in the examination of this
remarkable spectacle we returned to the tent, and divided the night
into three watches. At 11 P.M., when           I was asleep, an explosion
occurred which caused the lantern suspended from the ridge of the tent
to oscillate to and fro—at least so I was informed by my assistant,
J. A. Carrel, who was keeping watch at the time. During my own
watch nothing remarkable occurred. 'The ejections of steam could be
heard going off from time to time; but the noise made on these occa
sions (as heard in the tent placed on the outside of the crater) was
not alarming.        The steam' sometimes boiled over the edge of the
rim,  and     enveloped the tent. Temperature fell during the night to
130 F.                         ,
    “ We were astir at
                            daybreak on the 19th, and went again to the
edge    of   the rim.   The bottom of the crater was again indistinguish
able by reason of steam, but the upper part of it was reasonably clear.
I  photographed a part of it, and measured directly 600 feet along the
rim by means of a <U+FB01>ne line, and, by taking angles with a theodolite
from the two ends of this base, found that the diameter of the rim
was about 2,000 feet from north to south, and 1,500 feet from east to
west.
    “ Our tent was rendered a
                                 dusky grey colour by fragments of scoria
ceous matter, which were ejected during our stay. A quantity of this
was collected (described below).          These minute fragments were
evidently thrown out by the steam blasts, though it should be said
that I did not on any single occasion notice anything ejected with
or falling from the steam.
   “ After 8 A.M. on the 19th the wind became
                                                 dangerously high, and we
could not remain upon the rim, but we stayed near the summit until
2 P.M., re-ascending from time to time when the weather moderated.
We arrived again at the <U+FB01>rst camp on the evening of the 19th, and at
Machachi on February 24th.

has a fractured outline.         There is much variation     in  the amount
of enclosures; in some of the crystals they are almost absent, in
some they abound.        They are granules and microliths of pyroxene,
scales    of iron-glance,     often apparently formed along lines of
fracture, opacite, and brown glass.       The outer part of the crystals is
generally   free  from   enclosures;   the  interior is sometimes full of
them—the latter case, however, is rare.

several granules of iron peroxide scattered throughout              the slide.
The ground-mass consists of a colourlessglassy base, densely crowded
with microliths of felspar about '001 long, probably for the most
part oligoclase.     The rock accordingly is an hyperstheniferous augite
andesite.
   The most interesting specimen from the vicinity of Mr. Whymper’s
<U+FB01>rst camp is a compact subvitreous rock, almost black in colour with
a few light-coloured      specks, having a slightly rough subconchoidal
fracture ; in short, macroscopically, a very typical augite-andesite of
the dark type which so often contains hypersthene.
   The microscopic examination fully bears out the above inference.
Scattered about in the ground-mass are numerous crystals of plagic
elastic felspar similar to those described above, probably labradorite,
seldom exceeding '03 inch in greatest length; also numerous very
well-characterised crystals of hyperst-hene and some of augite, with
granules of magnetite.        The ground-mass consists of very minute
elongated felspar microliths and pyroxenic granules, with much dusty
opacite, crowded in a glassy base.        This rock also is a typical hyper
stheniferous augite-andesite.
    According to Mr. Whymper, comparatively little rock in situ was
 met with upon the route which he followed on his ascent of the cone
 of Cotopaxi, the surface being principally covered by débris and ash,
 and the above are the only two specimens which he collected. But of
 the more fragmental materials he has brought back several examples.
    Three specimens of a dark purple-grey slightly vesicular lava,
 speckled with small crystals of a glassy felspar, were collected at an
 elevation of about 12,000 feet.      They are rounded in form, and range
 in size, accOrding to Mr. Whymper, from a diameter of about 4 feet

  1884.]    Microscopic Structure of     some Books  from Ecuador.      121
  downwards.      Some of these lie in positions to which they could
  not have been brought by water, and they are doubtless volcanic
. bombs. They are no doubt augite-audesites; the actual rock having
  a general likeness to that from the <U+FB01>rst camp, as well as to the
  highest rock on Chimborazo (described below).
     From an elevation of from 15,000 to 16,000 feet he has brought a
  number of pieces of a pumiceous scoria of rather glassy aspect.       The
  vesicles are of considerable size, and occupy more than half the
  volume of each fragment.       These specimens are of various shades of
  dull grey in colour, being rather lighter than the last-named rocks,
  and without the crystals of felspar.      The rock is most probably also
  an augite-andesite, but is evidently in a more glassy condition than
  the others, although we must allow something to the greater tenuity
  of the material.                                      -
     In <U+FB01>xing the tent at his <U+FB01>rst camp (about 15,100 feet) Mr.
  Whymper (as mentioned above) dug through three layers of ash.          At
  the top was a miscellaneous accumulation of fragments, then came a
  stratum of <U+FB01>ne ash, about 7 inches deep, followed by a stratum of
  slightly coarser material.
     The upper of these two strata consists of pumiceous lapilli of a pale
  grey colour, often from an eighth to a quarter of an inch in diameter,
  evidently closely allied in lithological character to the lighter scoria,
  already described, from near this tent.     There is with them a certain
  admixture of <U+FB01>ner     dust,  which chie<U+FB02>y consists of pulverised glass,
  and has very probably to some extent been formed by attrition since
  the material was collected. Mineral fragments are occasionally
  distinguished.    On the examination of a small portion mounted on a
  slide, the mineral fragments appear more common. Most of these
  are broken crystals, often with tolerably regular edges (de<U+FB01>ned no
  doubt by cleavage planes), of a plagioclastic felspar, similar to that
  described in the rock slides; to several of these minute portions
  of the scoriaceous rock are still adherent; there are also one or two
  fragments of a dull green augite, and two (in conjunction) of a
  brownish-green mineral, which in form, extinction, and dichroism
  agree with the mineral described in these papers as hypersthene.
  Probably one or two more fragments occur, but they are less charac
  teristic; the mineral is not common. The lower material is much
  darker in colour, approaching nearer to the tint of the rock seen in
  situ. There are occasional lapilli, ranging up to the size of a small pea,
  but the most abundant are granules almost the size of the heads of
  ordinary pins, or even a little smaller.     On closer examination this
  deposit is seen to consist of       a  dark scoria, not very vesicular,
  together with occasional fragments of the usual minerals.       These are
  less recognisable under the microscope than in the case last described,
  as they appear to be rather smaller and more embedded in a scoria

ceous   crust.    The   diiference, however,   is probably   of but little
importance.
   Besides the above specimens, Mr. Whymper placed in my hands             .
seven parcels of volcanic dust.         The <U+FB01>rst (No. I) represents the
material strewn upon the roof of his tent, by the explosions which
occurred, as described above, duiing the night which he spent upon
the summit.        The second (No. II) was obtained under circum
stances hardly less remarkable.        On July 3 Mr. Whymper made his
second ascent of Chimborazo.          The morning was <U+FB01>ne.       Cotopaxi,
some 65 miles away, was clearly seen, and at <U+FB01>rst “ was not smoking
at all.” At 5.40 an. an eruption suddenly commenced. “A column
of inky black smoke rose with immense rapidity 20,000 feet above the
top of the crater, that is to say, to a height of about 40,000 feet
above the sea; was then caught by an easterly wind, borne at right
angles to its former course, then was taken by a northerly wind and
carried down upon us.” But at 1.20 the dust had not yet reached
the summit of Chimborazo, and did not begin to fall till shortly after
the arrival of the party thereon; but during their brief stay (1 hour
10 minutes) it “fell to such an extent as to blacken the plateau all
over, so that it lost all resemblance to snow, and looked like a
ploughed <U+FB01>eld. This ash was wonderfully <U+FB01>ne, and penetrated
everything, <U+FB01>lled the working parts of instruments, rendered photo
graphy a failure, and almost prevented us from eating, as our mouths
became <U+FB01>lled with grit directly we opened them          .  .  .  .  Extra
ordinary and ghastly effects in the sky.” The wind was strong from
the north-east, and bitterly cold.      The ash continued to fall during
the whole of the descent, and during their absence had not only
covered but also <U+FB01>lled the tent (pitched at a height of 15,950 feet).
   N0.  III  is a specimen of the dust of the same eruption, which fell
at Ambato, between the two mountains, and about 45 miles from
Cotopaxi.
   No. IV (from the same) fell at Riobamba, due south of Cotopaxi
and at about the same distance as Chimborazo.
   No. V is a specimen of volcanic dust collected at Quito (35 miles
distant) during a great eruption which occurred in the year 1879,
when the material fell in such quantities that there was pitch dark
ness for a time at midday.
   No. VI, another specimen of the same from Chillo, rather more
than 20 miles from Cotopaxi, where the <U+FB02>ood caused by the eruption
did great   damage.                  -
   No. VII is a sample of an ash collected by Mr. Whymper from
hollows and sheltered places in the interior of the crater of Cotopaxi.
This he thinks the result of some more violent eruption than usual.
   The following is a description of the microscopic structure of these
volcanic dusts.

11884.]      Microscopic  Structure of some Roe/cs  from Ecuador.       123
   No.   I. (Tent.) A grey dust with rather darker specks. The grains
range     from '02 inch in diameter downwards, a considerable pro
portion varying between this and about '01 inch. They may be
thus   distinguished :——(A) rock fragments, (B) mineral fragments.
(A) These consist of (11.) chips of colourless or nearly colourless glass,
sometimes almost clear, sometimes clouded with ferrite or opacite, and
containing microliths of felspar, &c.—chips, in short, of glassy lavas,
similar to those described above and elsewhere in this paper; (1))
rough opaque, or nearly opaque, grains, rather more numerous and
larger in size, sometimes translucent at the edges, and including
microliths of felspar and augite; these, when viewed with a dark
background, have a scoriaceous exterior, and are greyish, blackish, or
reddish-brown in colour; they are evidently minute lapilli of an
andesitic lava. (B) Among these the following minerals may be
recognised :—(a) felspar, showing occasionally plagioclastic twinning;
(b) more rare, augite and perhaps hypersthene.         I notice fragments
both of glass and of minerals even among the <U+FB01>ner dust, together
with black specks, probably magnetite.
   No. II. (Chimborazo.)        Fine dust of a slightly paler and redder
colour than the last. The grains which make up this interesting
deposit, as indicated by a glance at the slides with the unaided eye, are,
as might be expected, decidedly smaller than those which characterise
N 0. I, a very few only attain to a diameter of '01 inch, and this is barely
exceeded.      Fragments measuring from ‘003 to '004 inch are common,
and they vary from this size to the <U+FB01>nest dust; the characteristic of the
                     I
deposit, so far as can ascertain, being the presence of grains ranging
from about '001 to '003 inch.       They consist, as before, of rock frag
ments and mineral fragments. Among the former (A) the rough dark
lapilli are rare; the majority being translucent and apparently smooth
externally.      These are chips of glass, commonly of a pale brownish
colour, in which acicular microliths, probably of felspar, are frequent,
with specks of ferrite, and possibly a granule or two of a pyroxenic
mineral; vacuoles are certainly. rare. (B) The mineral fragments are
felspar, as above, with a little augite, and there is one well-formed
hypersthene crystal '01 inch long, in which are enclosures of iron
peroxide, &c., and, I think, minute cavities. Fragments of felspar
and acicular crystallites are rather abundant among the <U+FB01>ner dust.
   N0.  III   (the dust from Ambato) does not materially differ from
No. II, except that perhaps the size of the fragments is rather more,
variable.      Although there is a large quantity of very small chips
there is a slightly greater proportion of fragments about '01 in
diameter, and a considerable number of these are scoria, which is
almost opaque.        In those that are transparent small vesicles, as
might be anticipated, are slightly more numerous than in the other
cases.

124                    Prof. T. G. Bonney.       On the          [June 19,
    N0. IV   (the dust from Riobamba) does not appear to me to differ
materially from No. II, except that perhaps it is very slightly coarser,
and the glass chips appear to be a little more vesicular, and so there is
a somewhat larger pr0portion of fragments of colourless or almost
                                                               -
colourless pumice.
    N0. V (Quito).—A slightly paler dust than No. II, with which its
constituents correspond more nearly than with the <U+FB01>rst, but there are
a few more of the opaque scoriaceous fragments described in the latter,
and the grains occasionally attain a diameter of '007 or '008 inch.     In
the brown glass chips, however, vacuoles, commonly spherical, some
times elongated, are abundant; many of them range from about '0001
to '0002 inch in diameter, but some are still smaller.
    In N 0. VI (Chillo) there are occasionally fragments about '01 inch
in diameter, but they appear to be less common than in the other
slides, and chips not exceeding '002 inch diameter predominate.
These are glass and mineral fragments, as above; lapilli appear to be
very rare.     I think the glass is rather more vesicular than is the case
in No. II, but in all these samples of dusts which have travelled for
so considerable a distance from the volcano        I do not consider the
di<U+FB01>erences more than varietal, and we have in them the de'bris of
a  microporphyritic hyperstheniferous augite-andesite.
    No. VII—A dust consisting of dark granules, mixed with light
grey and reddish specks.          The materials are rather coarse, the
granules commonly ranging from about '01 to '015 inch. The most
abundant are minute lapilli of scoriaceous aspect and dark colour,
almost black; in less numbers are glassy whitish and reddish
granules: with these occur fragments of felspar, augite, and hyper
sthene.     Of the latter mineral there was a fairly perfect crystal about
 '015 long, which exhibited a very marked and characteristic dichroism
and extinction.      The granular character and comparative coarseness
of the dust readily distinguishes it from the other examples, and
brings it nearer to those described from the locality of the <U+FB01>rst
tent.
    I am indebted to the kindness of Professor Judd, not only for
having a series of the above volcanic dusts excellently mounted for me
in his laboratory, but also for the gift of two slides of the materials
ejected from Krakatoa in the eruptions of last year. Of these, one is
a specimen of the pumice found <U+FB02>oating in the Sunda. Straits, a
                                                          ”
vesicular clear glass, like some viscid <U+FB02>uid “ whipped      to a foam and
then allowed to <U+FB02>ow, which presents but little resemblance to the
materials ejected from Cotopaxi.         Neither does the other specimen
(from the ash which fell at Batavia, after a journey of 95 miles)
present a marked resemblance, for although there is a general simi
larity in the presence of mineral fragments of the same species, yet
the rock fragments dilfer in the predominance of glasses allied to that

 1884.]       Microscopic Structure of     some Rec/cs   from Ecuador.    125
just mentioned; the most common in the Batavia dust being a very
 light brown “ <U+FB02>uted ” or possibly porous glass, with occasional chips
 of the pumice itself.          In short, in the Krakatoa rock-materials,
 “ glass foam” predominates, while in            those of Cotopaxi we have a
 much      larger proportion of either chips of ordinary glass or more
 solid sconia. One would, therefore, assume, and this would be in
 accordance with the far greater violence of these eruptions of Kra
 katoa, that the molten materials in this volcano had become far more
 completely saturated with steam at a high pressure before the
 explosions occurred, which hurled them into the upper regions of the
 atmosphere. Herr R. O. M. Verbeck, in a very interesting report on
  Krakatoa, printed in “ Nature,” vol. xxx, p. 10, states that the steam
 cloud from Krakatoa on May 20, 1883, must have reached a height of
  at least 11,000 metres (about 36,000 feet), and during the more
  violent explosions of August 26 and 27 may very well have reached
  15 to 20 kilometres (49,213 to 65,618 feet). Cotopaxi, by its frequent
  “
     puf<U+FB01>ngs,” exhales, as it were, the imprisoned vapours, and thus its
  ejectments are less uniformly vesicular.         It would be worth noticing
  whether the materials ejected from volcanoes which had erupted after
  long intervals of repose were more pumiceous than those discharged
  from vents where there is always more or less of disturbance.
                                    Chimborazo.
      “ Ohimborazo has for centuries been known to be a very
                                                                         lofty
  mountain.      Humboldt (“ Aspects of Nature,” vol. i, p. 96) says that
  for a long time into the present century it was “ everywhere regarded
  as the highest mountain in the world,” and it still ranks as the most
  elevated in Ecuador.        From my mercurial barometer observations on
  the summit on January 4, 1880, and July 3, 1880, its height appeared
   to be 20,545 and 20,489 feet respectively.             The height I  adopt,
  namely, 20,517     feet, is the mean  of these   observations. According to
   Humboldt (“Aspects of Nature,” vol. i, p. 57), its height is 21,423
  feet.
      “ The   summit of Chimborazo bears north-east from Guayaquil,
   distant about 91 miles. The valley of the River Chimbo forms the
   boundary of the mountain, properly speaking, on the western side.
   This river at the bridge of Guaranda is 8,530 feet above the sea. On
   the north, the depression (used as a pass) between the mountains
   Carihuairazo and Chimborazo is the northern boundary of the latter.
   This is 14,400 feet above the sea. On the south it is bounded by the
   great sandy plain called the Arenal Grande, the highest point of which
   is about 14,000 feet above the sea, and is traversed by the track to
   Quito.     This plain is covered with de’bris from Chimborazo, which
   in various places has been re-assorted, and new forms strati<U+FB01>ed
    deposits.   On the east it is scarcely possible to say where the mountain

   terminates. Its lower slopes extend a long distance into the basin of
   Riobamba, and die out only a few miles to the west of the town of
   that name.”
      [From the Arenal Mr. Whymper has sent to me four small parcels
   of the “ sandy ” material. The <U+FB01>rst is a number of fragments of lava,
   slightly scoriaceous, varying in colour from a pale to a warm grey
   and speckled with black crystals (probably augite), the largest being
   about 1% inch in diameter. Small crystals of felspar appear to be
   rather abundant, and fragments of this and other minerals are rather
   frequent in the dust which is mixed up with the coarser parts.
   Another parcel consists chie<U+FB02>y of rather small lapilli, some being of a.
   pale reddish-brown colour.     A third consists of lapilli of the above
   tint, varying in 'size from rather larger than a hemp seed to a little
   less than a mustard seed; and the fourth, like the <U+FB01>rst, consists of
   larger fragments mingled with a considerable amount of <U+FB01>ne dust, the
   whole being a little paler in colour than the <U+FB01>rst specimen.        I  have
   not thought it necessary to subject these to a minute examination, as
   I have no doubt that they have a general agreement in their
   composition with the rocks of the mountain, and are simply volcanic
   (lust and lapilli, which have been ejected from Chimborazo in the
   days when it was an active volcano, and are now a good deal decomposed
   by the action of percolating water.—T. G. B.]
      “ In
           plan, Chimborazo is elliptical, and its longer diameter extends
   approximately from north-east to south-west.         In this direction, at
  the level of 14,000 feet, the mountain extends over about 14% English
   miles. When viewed from certain directions Chimborazo is seen to
  be crowned by two rounded snow-covered points.          From true east or
   west these points conceal each other, and the general appearance of
  the mountain when viewed at considerable distances from all points of
   the compass, is that of a cone, the minor details being indistinguishable.
      “ On a close
_                    approach, the subordinate features destroy the cone
  like effect of Chimborazo.     From the south, the two summits are well
  seen, but as the traveller bound for Quito passes round the eastern
  side the mountain gradually takes the appearance of a range.           From
  the north-west or north-north-west,       at a distance of three or four
  miles from the mountain, the lofty and almost vertical cli<U+FB01>'s which are
  found on that direction assume great importance, and nearly conceal
  the snowy domes which crown the true summit.
      “ The
             ridges which radiate from the upper part of Chimborazo are
  too numerous to be speci<U+FB01>ed.        Those not covered by snow or glacier
  are mostly, if not entirely, old <U+FB02>ows of lava, which have been greatly
  eroded, and are much decomposed.           In numerous places they are
  almost completely buried in their own ruin. The general appearance
  of the ridges which are enveloped by snow or glacier renders it
  probable that they too are fundamentally old lava streams.

1884.]     Zlficrorzropic Structure  of some Rocks  from Ecuador.      127
   “The whole of the upper part of Chimborazo is crowned by snow
covered glacier, forming a glacier plateau, from which numerous
glaciers take their rise. In passing around the mountain       I remarked
twelve glaciers, all of considerable size, <U+FB02>owing from this plateau.
The glaciers have their greatest development upon the eastern and
north-eastern sides of the mountain.          There is one to the south
south-west of the second summit, that is wholly formed by the
re-consolidation of glacier ice, which falls over the great cli<U+FB02>'s at its
head. This glacier we called Glacier de Débris.         The clean sections
which are exposed in the upper glacier by its breaking away and
falling over the above-mentioned cliffs show that the ice sheet on the
summit is more than 200 feet in thickness.
      I
    “ found
               roches montonne'es upon Chimborazo, in a valley (or vallon)
leading in a south-westerly direction from the second summit.           In
this valley there is not at the present time any glacier, and this is
the only place in the whole of the Andes of the Equator where 1
have observed roches montonne'es at any considerable distance from
existing glaciers.      Retrograding and advancing glaciers may, how
ever, be remarked in various places.        On the north-eastern side of
Chimborazo some very large moraines which are in the vicinity of
the existing glaciers, indicate they were of much greater magnitude
in some previous period. It may be that many more traces of glacier
action would be apparent if the rocks of this region disintegrated less
easily.
   “ The
           average level to which the glaciers descend on Chimborazo
may, I think, be stated at 15,600 feet.        The snow line is approxi
mately 1,000 feet higher.
   “The whole of the apex of Chimborazo is enveloped by snow
covered glacier, and upon the immediate summit there is a con
siderable (and slightly concave) plateau, on the rim of which the two
crowning snow-domes are situated. The more northern of these two
is slightly the loftier, and there can be little doubt that they cover the
highest points of the rim of the crater of the old volcano, and that the
hollow plateau lying between them is the <U+FB01>lled-up crater itself.
   “The highest rock which we noticed upon either of our ascents
was about 1,000 feet below the summit, a scoriaceous lava, which
appeared in small patches, and was apparently in consolidated beds.
The highest rock in situ beneath this which we were able to collect
was at the height of 18,400 feet, from the lower beds of the great
cliffs facing the south, which support the second summit. It is a
trachyte of a coarse red colour, and is one of the most common rocks
on Chimborazo.        Above it, disposed in parallel bands, were a large
variety of strata of various natures, and of widely di<U+FB01>erent colouring;
and upon the rare occasions that these cliifs were lighted by the sun
they presented an appearance as attractive as the well-known slopes

 of Alum Bay. It was impossible to collect these in situ, the cli<U+FB01>s
being well-nigh perpendicular;          but specimens from all the strata
were broken off by the ice falling from the glaciers above, and fell
along with the ice on to the Glacier de Débris below.             From the
surface of this glacier       I collected numerous specimens,     and they
embrace most of the varieties of rock to be found on the mountain.
Amongst this de'bris was found a small fragment of native sulphur.
    “ There is a prominent and important ridge leading from the second
summit in a south-south-westerly direction.           Our second and third
camps (16,600       and    17,300  feet  respectively) at which we passed
sixteen days and nights, were established on this ridge, which starts
from the foot of the above-mentioned cliffs and extends right down to
the arenal grands. The specimens collected in situ from the rocks at
the second and third camps are nearly identical in nature.
    “Our fourth camp (14,400 feet) was established on the southern
side of a very prominent lava stream that starts high up on the
mountain on its northern side, which at its commencement descends a
little to the east of north, and in its lower course bends round towards
the west; and our <U+FB01>fth camp (15,950 feet) was placed about two
miles to the south~west of the last named, against some large blocks
of lava.
    “
      On the southern side of the mountain there are numerous masses
of scoria lying about, in the same manner as is seen around the active
volcano Cotopaxi, which may either have been ejected from Chimbo
razo when it was in a state of activity, or have fallen from its decom
posing beds. The whole of the western side of the mountain (which
has,   I believe, scarcely been visited by earlier travellers) was found
between about 13,000 and 15,000 feet to be covered by vast sandy
plains.
    “It was observed during our sojourns upon and in the neighbour
hood of Chimborazo in the months of December, 1879, and January,
June, July, 1880, that easterly and north-easterly winds were of most
frequent occurrence. These winds usually brought bad weather, and
much snpw fell while they lasted.          To this preponderance of easterly
and north-easterly winds I attribute the great development of glacier
which is found upon those sides of the mountain, and the occurrence
of the vast sandy plains which exist on the western or lee side. The
sand is drifted entirely away from the eastern slopes, which, at the
corresponding elevation of 13,000 to 15,000 feet, are rugged, <U+FB01>ssured,
and often troublesome to traverse. The western side, at these eleva
tions, is free from dif<U+FB01>culty.          All <U+FB01>ssures and minor inequalities
are completely    eifaced,  and in the month of July, without any guide
except the barometer and compass, we made the circuit of the moun
tain at about the level of 14,000 feet, and struck with certainty the
exact spot upon the arenal grands at which we desired to arrive.

   “ Chimborazo
                   appears to have been an extinct volcano for a long
period.   The great size of its glaciers and complete e<U+FB01>acement of its
crater; the extent to which its rocks are decomposed and its ridges
shattered; and the occurrence of lichens upon almost the highest
rocks which were collected, are all indications that it is long since it
was in a state of activity.”     (E. W.)
   Mr. Whymper brought back a large suite of specimens from China
borazo ; from these   I  have selected eight for microscopic examination,
the others appearing to me to be either duplicates or decomposed
               '
specimens of the same or nearly identical rocks.         From the locality
of the second camp      I have examined two. The <U+FB01>rst was collected
from débris which had fallen from a cliff immediately above.           Hence
though  a  loose specimen,   it represents rock in situ at the  locality ; the
rock is a black subvitreous lava with a few light coloured specks, pre
senting a very close resemblance to that described above from the <U+FB02>ank
of Cotopaxi; one face of the specimen is scoriaceous.       The microscopic
character does not materially differ.      There are abundant crystals of
similar felspar (elongated forms being perhaps commoner) with
similar enclosures, also crystals of augite and hypersthene. One or
two grains, however, appear to me to be olivine.        There is a base of
brownish glass, pretty full of microliths (chie<U+FB02>y of felspar), with
specks of ferrite and opacite, and perhaps a little pyroxene.
   The other specimen is of a type which, as will be seen below, is
common on Chimborazo, and presents resemblances to rock already
described, especially that from Pamascucho below Nina-urcu on
Pichincha (“ Proceedings,” N0. 299, p. 225). This rock is a dullish
lavender-grey colour, with crystals of glassy felspars up to about
'1 inch long, and some minute blackish specks, which weather rather
a redder colour.    Under the microscope the di<U+FB01>erences from the other
are not so great as perhaps might have been expected, the chief one
being that the base is a nearly colourless glass.          I  think it very
probable that a little sanidine is present among the felspars. The
rock then is only a variety of the hyperstheniferous augite-andesites.
   The specimen taken near the third camp of Chimborazo, 17,300 feet,
and representing, as described above, the rock which prevails through
out the ridge by which the <U+FB01>rst ascent was made, from some distance
higher than the locality <U+FB01>rst mentioned, down to the second camp,
and even below, is a rock macroscopically related to the one last
described, but is a little redder in colour, more vesicular in structure,
and with slightly larger crystals of felspar (up to about 5th inch
diameter).     So far as the base and its included microliths are con
cerned, there is little to add to the preceding description, except that
a dusty ferrite is rather abundant, as the colour of the rock would lead
us to expect, the larger crystals of felspar do not materially differ from
those already described, hypersthene is abundant, undoubted augite

being rare, and there are two or three small crystals of a strongly
dichroic hornblende.      Also one or two crystals of what appears
to be an iron mica. The predominance of hypersthene entitles this to
the name of a hypersthene-andesite.
    From the <U+FB01>fth camp four specimens have been brought.          Of these
four are closely related, and are rocks presenting a general similarity
to the second specimen of the second camp, and to that from Parnas
cucho in the Pichincha massif as well as one from Guagra-ialina,
Antisana, being compact greyish lavas, with small crystals of white
felspar. I have examined one microscopically, and <U+FB01>nd that it then
presents some differences. The felspar crystals, indeed, are similar to
those already described, except that perhaps they are a little more
crowded with microlithic enclosures, but there are no well-de<U+FB01>ned
crystals of augite, hornblende, or hypersthene. Instead of these are
rather numerous elongated or rounded bodies, one of the former attain
ing '1 inch in length, consisting of an external zone of dusty opacite,
containing a less quantity of the Same mineral associated with small
crystals or specks of a pyroxenic mineral.            I
                                                    have occasionally seen
these bodies (for   one cannot  give  them  a  de<U+FB01>nite   name), and    pre   I
sume that they are analogous to the cases of replacement of augite
by magnetite, which are not uncommon, and. are rude pseudomorphs of
a mineral of the pyroxenic group, or in some cases possibly of mica<U+FB01>"
There are as usual scattered grains of magnetite, and the ground
mass is a glassy base, crowded with lath-like felspar microliths and
granules of magnetite. The rock then is an andesite, but of a
slightly exceptional character.
    The second specimen, Mr. Whymper states, di<U+FB02>ers from any other
rocks which he saw upon the mountain.         It is a rather crumbly rock
of very irregular fracture, having a very dark grey ground-mass, in
which crystals of glassy-white felspar, up to about '2 inch long, are
embedded.       When examined microscopically it does not appear to
differ very materially from some of those already described, and
is very closely related to that forming the ridge of the mountain,
dilferent only in the colour of the ground-mass, and, like          it,
                                                                 being best
named a hypersthene-andesite.
    Mr. Whymper brought a. large series of rocks collected at an eleva
 tion of about 18,400 feet to represent the materials of the cliff on the
southern face of the mountain beneath the second summit.          They are
for the most part andesite lavas, more or less decomposed, varying
considerably in tint and in compactness, but evidently closely allied
lithologically.   Several were not in a condition favourable for examina

tion, and as   I feel convinced   of their close relationship, I have only
made a microscopic examination         of two of the best preserved speci
mens.     These are somewhat intermediate between the two specimens
mentioned above from Pichincha and Antisana; being compact greyish
lavas, with scattered crystals of white felspar. The redder specimen—
which most resembles the above rocks, does not, after what has been
said, need a detailed description ; it is a hypersthene-andesite with a
little hornblende. The duller-coloured specimen is an augite-andesite
with some hypersthene. The base of each is a clear glass, containing
many very minute. microliths, probably of felspar, and irregularly
 clouded with a grey dust and opacite.
    Only one specimen remains to be described, the highest rock
 obtained by Mr. Whymper on Chimborazo, at an elevation of about
 19,300 feet.     It is a slightly scoriaceous lava, rough to the touch,
 almost purple-black in colour, with numerous very minute specks of a
 glassy felspar. Except that the base is rendered rather more opaque
 by disseminated opacite, it does not differ very materially from several
 already described.     There are the usual crystals of felspar, one or two
 being   much  rounded   and very full of dull glassy enclosures ; there is
 a  fair amount of augite, but no well-characterised hypersthene; so
 that the rock may be named an augite-andesite.
    Thus the rocks of Chimborazo appear to be andesites, and rather
 closely related; the only variation of any importance being in the
 amount of hypersthene and the occasional presence of hornblende.

    I  have been favoured by Mr. Whymper with some short notes on
 the structure and physical features of the three volcanic mountains
 whose rocks are investigated on this occasion, and have pre<U+FB01>xed them
 to my lithological descriptions.        It is remarkable what a general
 uniformity there is in the products of these summits of the Equatorial
 Andes, and this, as Mr. Whymper informs me, was so obvious that he
 made but small collections from the mountains which were visited
 during the latter part of his journey.

called Abraspungo (14,479), and its northern slopes extend almost to
the town of Amhato (8,500).          The road to Quito winds round its
eastern side, and may be considered to mark its boundaries in that
direction.
    “ It is stated
                    by historians that this mountain was formerly loftier
than Chimborazo, and that a portion of its apex fell during a great
earthquake which occurred at the end of the 17th century.             I saw
nothing to lead me to suppose that the mountain was           at  any time
much loftier than at present, though it appears beyond dispute that a
great fall actually occurred at the above-mentioned period.        The part
which fell may have formed the northern and eastern side of its
crater. At the present time the three peaks which are upon its
summit ridge are disposed in a horseshoe form, and I conjecture
formed the southern and western sides of a crater which is now
buried underneath glaciers.
    “ We ascended the middle
                                   peak of these three, and by mercurial
barometer found that its height was 16,514 feet.         Messrs. Reiss and
Stiibel by A calculated the height of Caxihuairazo to be 16,752 feet.
They, however, probably measured the most eastern of the three
peaks, which is actually somewhat loftier than the central one.
    “
      The lower slopes of this mountain are very swampy, from which it
may be conjectured that there are not so many <U+FB01>ssures in the soil as
is common in the Ecuadorian Andes, and large thickets of trees, some
of considerable age, grow high up its <U+FB02>anks, from which it is reason
able to conclude that it is long since the mountain was an active
volcano. The rocks at the time of our expedition were much covered
up by snow in the higher regions, and by earth and vegetation on
the lower slopes.      Such rocks as were exposed appeared closely allied
to the specimens collected upon Chimborazo and the other mountains,
and we only brought away specimens from the summit of the central
 peak. These were taken close to its highest point.”            W.)
    The rock appears to be pretty evenly jointed, it weathers brown, and
 breaks with a rather rough irregular fracture.      The colour on this is a
 warm purplish-grey mottled with darker spots, and speckled with
 small rather light coloured crystals of felspar with a rather satiny
 lustre. A few minute vesicles may be perceived under the microscope.
 The larger felspar crystals in the slide are rather numerous, and
 commonly vary from about '05 to '07 inch in the longer diameter.
 They exhibit        well developed polysynthetic      twinning, and are
 lahradorite or a closely allied form.      Enclosures of glass or various
 microliths are occasionally seen, but the majority of the crystals are
 fairly clear, though a few are very dirty, and have a. corroded look at
 the exterior.     There is also present in the ground-mass a fair number
 of crystals of augite of a yellowish-green colour, not exceeding about
  '03 inch in length, and two or three which in structure, dichroism,

crystals  of hematite and scales of iron-glance, or possibly small augite
crystals iron-stained.   The ground-mass appears to be a clear glass
thickly studded with dusty ferrite, and with minute crystallites in
part, at least, felspar.    The rock is, therefore, an augite-andesite,
and bears some resemblance to the darker-coloured rock described in

Part from Pichincha.
                                  Cayambe.
    “The name Cayambe belongs both to a town and to a mountain.
The summit of the latter bears north-east by east from Quito, distant
45 miles. According to my mercurial barometer observations its
height is 19,185 feet, and this is remarkably close to the height
obtained by Messrs. Reiss and Stubel by A, which was 19,161 feet.
The French Academicians at the beginning of the 18th century made
its elevation slightly greater than my determination, and Humboldt
does not appear to have measured it. It is fourth in rank of the
Ecuadorian Andes, being inferior in altitude to Chimborazo, Coto
paxi, and Antisana.
   “The upper 4,000 feet of Cayambe are almost entirely covered by
snow and glaciers, and such small patches of rock as are not covered
are indistinguishable at the distance of a few miles. From Quito the
mountain has a very noble appearance, but owing to the cloudiness of
the atmosphere it is not, perhaps, seen during as much as the <U+FB01>fth
of the year. The snow-line on Cayambe is lower than upon Chim
borazo, though the former mountain is almost exactly upon the
Equator, and the latter is considerably to the south of it. The upper
part of Cayambe is a huge hump, and does not appear cone-shaped
from most directions. At the level of 9,000 feet the mountain extends
about 18 miles from north to south, and 141 to 15 miles from east to
west.
   “ Until the time of my
                            journey, it was conjectured that the moun
tain was still an active volcano. We inspected the whole of its slopes
fairly well all round, and saw no open crater. It is probable that here,
as in other of the Ecuadorian Andes, there was a crater near or at
the summit which is now <U+FB01>lled with snow. It is certain that Cayambe
is not now an active volcano, and that it has been one in the past—
the numerous streams of lava which are found upon its slopes leaving
no possibility of doubt on the subject.
    “
      Very few rocks being exposed upon the upper part of the moun
tain,  I did here as upon Antisana, and collected specimens upon the
highest attainable subsidiary peak having rocks uncovered, and from
this point (Pointe Jarrin, 16,163 feet), which hears about the same
relation to Cayambe as the Aiguille de Gouter does to Mont Blanc,
I  took specimens of the rocks in situ, and of the morainic fragments

lying upon them.       There are no rocks exposed at the immediate
summit. The highest rock we were able to obtain in situ was taken
from a small patch of glacier-crowned cliff, some hundreds of feet
below the central (and highest) peak on its western side, at a height
probably of about 18,800 feet. The culmination of the mountain is
an irregular ridge, several hundred yards long, having three distinct
snowy bosses.”     (E.
    From   the  above-named    lower summit—the      Pointe Jarrin—Mr.
Whymper has brought        nine  specimens,  two  of which were broken
from rock in situ.       Of the seven specimens collected from the
débm's on the peak, two are rather scoriaceous: one, a small frag
ment, is a whitish, rather glassy rock, containing small crystals of a
glassy felspar, with little plates of black mica and crystals of horn
blende (P), in short, a very typical light-coloured “trachyte;” the
other is a rather denser rock with a pale reddish matrix and dull
whitish felspar crystals, containing apparently less mica or hornblende.
The other <U+FB01>ve are evidently varieties of a rock of the same general
character; but one specimen is rather more micaceous than the rest.
The remaining four may be described as generally compact rocks, in
colour varying from a dull purplish to a reddish tint—the latter
being probably due to an alteration in the iron constituent—in fact,
 I believe the di<U+FB01>erences in the colour to be mainly the results of
 weathering.    Fairly numerous crystals of whitish felspar, in diameter
 from about 015 inch downwards, but generally not more than 01 inch,
 are scattered in the matrix.      I have examined microscopically two
 specimens from the débris, and one of the two from the rock in situ.
 I   will describe <U+FB01>rst the most uniform looking and apparently
 best preserved specimen from the de'bris; a dull purplish-grey rock,
 with a fair number of small crystals of whitish felspar, an unequal
 fracture, and rather clean joint faces.     The base is a clear glass, so
  crowded with specks of opacite and ferrite and microliths of felspar
 as to have a grey dusty look, except in the thinnest sections.    In this
 are   scattered the usual crystals of felspar (plagioclastic, probably
 labradorite) generally fairly free from inclusions.   Magnesian silicates
 are not very common, but I recognise       both  hornblende  and augite,
 the former (occurring as the larger crystals) being somewhat black
 bordered and replaced by opacite, the latter clean and probably
 belonging to a later epoch in the consolidation of the rock.       There
 are also to be seen scattered grains and crystals      of magnetite and
 perhaps of hematite. The rock has a general resemblance to some
 of the higher fragments from Chimborazo.
    The next specimen (occasionally slightly vesicular, evidently a little
 decomposed)    is of a warm-red colour with crystals of glassy felspar
 up to 0‘2 inch, and a black mica, or hornblende, rather more con
 spicuous than in the rest.    It bears a general resemblance to some of

 1884.]    Jtlicroscopic   Structure  of some Rocks   from Ecuador.      135
the “trachytes” from the Euganean Hills.              Under the microscope
it is seen, like the last described, to have a clear base with micro
liths of felspar, but scattered in this are numerous rods of iron oxide,
and plates of a very ferruginous mica, sometimes all but opaque.
There are a few crystals of hornblende in diameter up to about
'04 inch, which are strongly dichroic.           There is but little if any
augite.
    One of the two specimens from the rock in situ appeared rather
intermediate between the two varieties just described, and as it
seemed rather decomposed           was not sliced; the other, in better
preservation, resembled the more mottled or streaky looking specimens
among the de'bris, and afforded slight indications of a <U+FB02>uidal structure.
This is indicated under the microscope by a “<U+FB02>ow ” of the microliths
rather than by a marked striping or banding.            Except for this, the
matrix resembles that of the <U+FB01>rst described, with some approach to
that of the second.      There is nothing special to note in the larger
felspar crystals     which    are plagioclastic, similar to those so often
described; some are clear, some rather full of glass enclosures.
There are fairly numerous hornblende crystals, some of an olive
green, others of a brown-green           colour, strongly dichroic.    Some
augite crystals    are certainly present,  and  a few of a brown mica.
   Microscopically the specimen from the highest visible rocks on
Cayambe barely differs from that just described, except that a <U+FB02>uidal
structure is more inconspicuous.        The result of microscopic examina
tion is similar, the    differences  being but varietal; hornblende, iron
mica, and augite are present, the last being the less conspicuous
constituent.
   Thus the rocks of Cayambe are very uniform in character, and of
the same general type as those of Ohimborazo, Antisana (in part), and
Pichincha (in part).        They are andesites, but as they contain horn
blende and augite, as well as mica, it is di<U+FB02>icult to give them a dis
tinctive name.      I am inclined to view the <U+FB01>rst, and perhaps the third,
as minerals belonging to an earlier stage of consolidation than the
second: thus perhaps it is more appropriate to classify these rocks
with the augite-andesites, using the word hornblendic as a qualifying
epithet, except in the case of the second specimen described above,
which might perhaps be termed a mica-andesite.

entire eastern side quite free from snow, but there are upon its
opposite, or western, side some large snow-beds and couloirs which
are apparently permanent.         The mountain therefore just enters the
snow-line.
    “ The summit
                   ridge is a great wall, about 250 feet long, running
(approximately)    north  and east-south-east, having a sheer precipice on
its western, and a very steep cliff on its eastern side. Possibly this
wall should be regarded as a dyke. There is no regularly formed
crater upon any part of the mountain.
    “
      On the summit ridge I collected specimens of rock in situ, and of
de'bris lying upon it.     The crest of the ridge was almost covered by
rock débris and earth. Flowering plants were growing up to the
very highest point, and vegetation near the summit was more
abundant than was found at equal heights on any of the other
Ecuadorian Andes.”———(E.

vesicles, darkish grey, slightly inclining to brown in colour.             The
microscope shows that there is present a fair amount of a glassy
base, with a brown staining.        This base contains numerous acicular
colourless crystallites,   and  spots—often rather elongated—of opacite,
which not seldom are clustered together, and form a kind of frame to
the larger felspar crystals. These last are rather abundant, and very
commonly do not exceed about ‘02 inch diameter, though they are
occasionally considerably larger, four or <U+FB01>ve times the size.              The
latter often have the dirty look described above.           The slide contains
a few grains of a pyroxenic mineral, not very distinctly characterised.
    The ten specimens gathered at different localities on the summit
 ridge of Corazon a<U+FB01>ord the following varieties:—
    (A.) A grey pumiceous rock, larger vesicles, a little more than
 '1 inch diameter: volume of solid part and hollows about equal: with
 this may be classed a rather less vesicular specimen, with small
 felspar crystals; both these have a tendency to weather brown.
    (13.) Four specimens of more or less secriaceous rock of a purplish
 colour within, weathering externally to an Indian-red colour, and con
 taining specks of white felspar.
    (0.) Two specimens of dull grey rock with a rough fracture,
 speckled with small felspar crystals, and with a spotted look, one

from those already described that it will be enough to say that the

usual plagioclastic felspar, a fair amount of characteristic augite, and
a crystal or two of hypersthene.
    (0.) The less decomposed of the two specimens has been examined.
There are some varietal differences.             The larger felspar crystals
(labradorite)     are not quite  so  numerous    as in the other, while crystal
lites about '01 inch or rather less in longer diameter are very
numerous. There is a fair amount of well-characterised augite, with
grains of iron peroxide and opacite dust in a clear glassy base.

the slide is rendered more opaque by the presence of opacite.
    (E) is a rock of similar character, except that the base is yet more
opaque.       There is, however, one important distinction, that the
greater part of the pyroxenic constituent appears to be hypersthene,
and not augite. It is almost impossible to doubt the presence of an
orthorhombic mineral in this slide.
    On the summit of Corazon Mr. Whymper found two rock specimens,
evidently rudely dressed by hand, which will be described in his
forthcoming work on the Equatorial Andes.                The material of these
bore a close resemblance to the rocks described above under the group
(B).
    From the    above remarks     it would appear that the crest of Corazon
consists of augite-andesites, which only exhibit slight varietal di<U+FB01>er
ences, except in the last case (E), where hypersthene becomes rather
abundant, apparently predominating over the ordinary pyroxene. It
is a remarkable fact that the exterior aspect of the rock had at once re
minded me of those black, somewhat resinous-looking rocks—formerly
variously called melaphyres, pitchstone-porphyrite, &c.—which, of late
years, have been so frequently proved to contain hypersthene.

  VIII. “Note of        a Theory of Orthoptic and Isoptic Loci.”                   By
        CHARLES       TAYLOR, D.D., Master of St. John’s College,
        Cambridge.         Communicated by J. W. L. GLAISHER, M.A.,
       F.R.S. Received June 10, 1884.
    The orthoptic locus of a curve and its isoptic loci are the loci
 of the points of concourse of pairs of tangents drawn to it at
 right angles, and at angles equal to given angles, respectively. .
    As a step towards a general theory of such loci, of which special
 cases only have been treated hitherto, it is shown below that the order
 of the orthoptic locus of a curve of class 11. is n(n—l), and the order
 of its isoptic loci 2n.(n—-l).
    The principle on which our proof depends is that lines drawn from
 either of the circular points at in<U+FB01>nity I and               J   may be regarded as
 intersecting at any angle whatsoever} but such as are drawn from
any other point at in<U+FB01>nity, real or imaginary, can only be regarded as
parallel, unless one of them be the straight line at in<U+FB01>nity, which
makes an indeterminate angle with any straight line.
                1. The Orthoptic Locus of          0. Curve of any Class.
    To  a curve of the nth class        1!. tangents, constituting    %n(n-—1) quasi
 orthogonal pairs,      can      be   drawn     from    I  or  J.   Each  of these is
therefore a point of the order 3%”.(711—1) on the orthoptic locus, and
this locus, having in general no other points at in<U+FB01>nity, is of the order
11(n—1).
    If the  curve touches the line          IJ  in one point, n—l other tangents
 can in general be drawn to it from any point on LI, and each of them
 may be regarded as orthogonal to IJ. Every point at in<U+FB01>nity is
 therefore of the order n—l on the orthoptic locus, and the remainder
 of the locus when the factor IJ"_1 is subtracted is of the order
 n(n—1)—(n—1), that is to say (n—l)’, and contains                        I  and J as
points of the order %n(n—1)—(n—1), or %(n—l) (71—2)
    If the curve touches       IJ   in 1' points it appears in like manner that
the orthoptic locus contains            IJ    as a factor 'r(n—1) times, and the
 remainder of the locus is therefore of the order (n—r)(n—1), and
contains     I  and   J  as points of the order %n(n—1)—'r(n—l), or
                         I
%(n-—2r)(n—1).
   * To demonstrate the existence of the circular points, draw a circle, and upon it
take an arc    AB at random, and let x be either of the points in which the circle
meets the line at in<U+FB01>nity.      Any two straight lines through :0 may be regarded as
making zero angles with .rA and IB respectively, and therefore as including an angle
equal to that standing on the are AB, which may be of any magnitude whatsoever.
It readily follows that all circles pass through a“, and hence that there can be only
two such points on the line at in<U+FB01>nity.

     Notice in veri<U+FB01>cation the ease of the conics (de la Hire, 1685),
  and likewise that of the cardioid, whose orthoptic locus consists of a
  circle and a bicircular quartic, which together make up a tricircular
  sextic. When the curve resolves itself into n point-factors the
  orthoptic locus evidently consists of the é—nQn—l) circles described
. on the lines joining the points two and two as diameters.
                            2. Pedals of a Pair of  Curves.
     The locus of the vertex of a right angle whose arms envelope two
  curves of class m and class n respectively may be called the pedal of
  the two curves, or of the one with respect to the other, and the
  corresponding locus generated by the vertex of any other constant
  angle may be called a skew pedal of the two curves, or of the one
  with respect to the other. The former locus becomes a pedal
  commonly so called when one of the curves degenerates                  into a
  point.
     From the reasoning        used above  it is evident that the pedal of two
  such curves is an mn-circular Zmn-ic.
     This may also be deduced from the formula for the orthoptic locus
  as follows: The two curves make up a curve of class m+n, whose
  orthoptic locus is the aggregate of the pedal and the orthoptic loci
  of the two curves. The pedal is therefore of the order
                      (m+n)(m+n—1)—m(m—1)—n(n—1),
  that is to say, it is of the order    2mm,   and it contains I and J as points
  of the order mn.
                        3. Isoptic Loci and their Reciprocals.
     a. Any two tangents to a curve from             I or J may be.regarded as
  intersecting at angles a and 7r—az or these reversed, and their point of
  concourse thus belongs doubly t0 the corresponding isoptic locus.
  The order of such loci is therefore double of that of the orthoptic
  locus, and they pass twice as often through I and J.
     For example—
     (l.) The    ellipse', to which one pair of tangents only can be drawn
  from   I or J,  may be regarded as subtending any angle or its supple
  ment at those points. These are therefore double points on the
  corresponding isoptic locus, which is accordingly a bicircular quartic.
     (2.) The parabola may be regarded as subtending any angle or its
  supplement at every point on the line at in<U+FB01>nity.              Its isoptic loci
  therefore contain the factor IJQ, and the remainders, when this factor
  is rejected, are hyperbolas (or ellipses).
           It may be deduced from the formula for isoptic loci, or proved
  directly by the method used above, that the skew pedals of a pair
  of curves of class m and class n respectively are 2mn-circular,

140                  Theory    of Orthoptic and Isoptic Loci.                 [June 19,
4mn-ics.        Thus    the skew pedals of an ellipse with respect to a
point (regarded as a curve of the <U+FB01>rst class) are of the eighth order,
each consisting, of course, of two equal curves similar to the right
pedal.
    By taking a pair of lines drawn at random through either circular
point, which may be regarded as inclined at an indeterminate angle,
and supposing them to coalesce, we infer that any straight line through
I   or   J    may be regarded as making an indeterminate angle with
itself<U+FB01>"
    Hence the points of contact of the tangents from                      I and J to any
curve are points on its orthoptic locus, and they are doubly points on
its isoptic loci.
    In the case of the conics these are the only points in which such
loci meet the curve.           If, therefore, UE¢(w, y)=0 be a conic, and
10:0 its orthoptic locus, the bicircular quartics         *
                                                                   which are its isoptic
loci   will   be represented by
                                      U—k.u‘2=0,
where k is a constant which vanishes when the isoptic angle is zero,
in which case the locus consists of the conic and the line at in<U+FB01>nity,
 and is in<U+FB01>nite when the angle is a right angle, the isoptic being then
 the orthoptic locus.
    Reciprocally, in a curve of the nth order, if a chord subtends a
 constant angle at a <U+FB01>xed point its envelope                           is of the class
 2n(n—1).
    The various points in the theory of plane orthoptic and isoptic loci
 propounded in this note have been veri<U+FB01>ed by analytical methods in
 an unpublished          paper by Mr. J. S. Yeo, Fellow of St.                     J ohn’s

    The following notes on isoptic and other loci in space are taken

    A solid has in general six degrees of freedom to move. The corner
 of a cube whose three faces are constrained to touch a surface loses
 three and retains three, and the locus of a point rigidly connected with
 it is not a surface, but a solid bounded by a certain envelope. When
 the cube-angle envelopes a quadric it can enjoy one of its degrees of
 freedom without displacement of its vertex, for if a cone of the
 second degree has one triad of orthogonal tangent planes, it has a

in this case into a surface, the orthoptic sphere.          The locus of the
vertex of a      trihedral  angle which  envelopes  a  quadric is in general
the space bounded by two surfaces.

this cone can be circumscribed by a cube-angle provided             the point
lies within a certain solid space.      When the complex is of    the second
order the solid locus degenerates into a surface, which is a-quartic
passing through the imaginary circle at in<U+FB01>nity; and when the
 complex is composed of the tangent lines of a surface of the second
order the locus is made up of the surface and its orthoptic sphere.
     Similar considerations hold for the locus of the point of concourse
 of a triad of tangent lines at right angles.       When the complex is of
 the second order the locus degenerates      into a quadric.
     Mr. Larmor has brie<U+FB02>y considered the problem of a surface
 constrained to touch three surfaces, deducing as a special case that
 the locus of the vertex of a cube-angle whose faces touch a quadric
 or three confocal quadrics is a sphere.

     The battery which     I have the honour to bring under the notice of
 the Royal Society is one of high electromotive force, namely, about two
 and three quarter volts, and a single cell consequently decomposes
 water; it is very light and portable, and convenient for many purposes.
  The electro-positive element is sodium, the electro-negative element
  is either carbon, spongy platinum, copper, or other metallic gauze; no
  <U+FB02>uid is used in which to immerse the plates, but the atmospheric air
  which is always impregnated with more or less hygrometric moisture
  serves to set up the action of the battery by giving up suf<U+FB01>cient
  moisture to wet the surface of the sodium, so that a very thin <U+FB01>lm of
  <U+FB02>uid (a solution of soda), is thus interposed between the sodium and
  electro-negative element, and the internal resistance is very small in
  consequence      of the thinness of the <U+FB01>lm of <U+FB02>uid.        The sodium is
   used   in the  form  of plates, conveniently  about a  quarter of an inch
   thick, and the plates of carbon, of which one is placed on each side of
   the sodium, a little longer and about the same thickness as the
   sodium; these plates, carbon, sodium, carbon, are kept together by
   means of vulcanised rubber bands, and suspended vertically, a vessel
   being placed underneath to receive the soda solution as it forms.

       RAYLEIGH, D.O.L., F.R.S., and Mrs. H. SIDGWICK. Received
       June 18, 1884.
                                     (Abstract)
    The   paper contains a record of a long series of experiments,
extending over nearly two years.
    The measurement of the electric currents is direct, not depending
 upon a knowledge of the force of terrestrial magnetism.                   Three
 horizontal   coils  are   traversed   in  succession  by the electric  current.
 Of these two of large diameter are <U+FB01>xed, and at a distance apart
 equal to the radius of either. Symmetrically between them a smaller
 coil is suspended in the balance.             When the current passes, the
 suspended coil is pressed down, or lifted up, according to the
 connexions, and the observations relate to the double force called into
 operation when the direction of the current in the <U+FB01>xed coils is
 reversed.   In a paper read before the British Association at South
 ampton it was shown that this construction presents special advantages,
 and in particular that the calculation of the result does not require
 an accurate knowledge of the radii of the coils, but only of the ratio
 of the radii of the small and large coils. In this way one of the
 principal dif<U+FB01>culties, the measurement of the small coil, is evaded.
    The ratio of the radii is found by the electrical method of Bosscha.
 A large and small coil being adjusted so as to be concentric and
 coaxal, a very small magnet with attached mirror is suspended at the
 common centre. The two circuits are connected electrically in
 parallel, and resistance is added to one of them until no effect upon
 the suspended magnet follows a reversal of the battery current.             The
 ratio of the resistances, to be found immediately by comparison with
 standards, is the ratio of the galvanometer constants of the two coils,
 and from this the ratio of the radii may be obtained by the introduc
 tion of small corrections relating to the <U+FB01>nite dimensionsof the

sections.   Full particulars     are given of the procedure adopted               in the
reduction of the method to practice.
   The insulation of the small coil, which was wound upon a ring of
ebonite, was carefully tested with the induction balance after the
manner recommended by Graham Bell. The <U+FB01>rst attempt at
winding it proved a failure, several turns being short-circuited; and
we are of opinion that no coil of <U+FB01>ne wire can be thoroughly
depended upon which. has not been tested by some such method.
   The calculation of the constant of the current weighing apparatus
is best made with the aid of elliptic functions.     Both for our own
purposes and in order to facilitate the use of the method by others, we
have calculated a. table of the function
                          sin q {2Fy—(1 +      see   2'1   E7},
(see   “Maxwell’s Electricity,”      2nd edition, §701), for values of                q
ranging from 55°     to 70°.
   For determining the electro-chemical equivalent of silver, the
current passes also through silver voltameters.             The solution of
nitrate, or of chlorate,     contained in a platinum basin which serves
                            is
as the kathode.       The anode        is
                                       a   <U+FB02>at piece of <U+FB01>ne silver sheet,
wrapped in <U+FB01>lter-paper, and suspended by platinum wire at the top
of the liquid.    The duration of the current              determined by a
                                                                  is
chronometer, and allowance        ismade for the small loss of time (about
one-tenth second), incurred at each reversal of the current in the
<U+FB01>xed coils of the measuring apparatus.
   In the preliminary notice of March, 1884, the troubles into which
we were led by the use of acetate of silver were referred to. With
pure nitrate the manipulations present no particular di<U+FB02>iculty.          We
were equally successful with chlorate, prepared for us by Mr. Scott;
and the comparison of the results with nitrate and chlorate verify
Faraday’s law to a high degree of accuracy.
   In the reduction of the current weighings, we found          necessary to
                                                                       it
time all the observations,    and to  plot the readings  obtained in the two
positions of the reversing key as separate curves. The difference of
ordinates then represents the double electromagnetic force, as                       it
would have been found were              possible to take both observations
                                       it
simultaneously.      What    we  require for comparison with the mean
rate of silver deposit     is the mean square root of the di<U+FB01>erence of
weighings, and   iseasily obtained when once the curves are constructed.
Apart from errors relating to the constant of the apparatus, the
mean value of    a  tolerably steady current of half an hour’s duration
should be obtainable to about “71,66.        In our experiments, the whole
change of weight on reversal was about               grm., and each single
                                                       1
observation  was   correct   to  half   amilligram.    In the passage from

  144               Lord Rayleigh and Mrs. Sidgwick.               [June '19,
  the attraction to the current, the error is halved by the extraction of
  the square root.
     The currents actually employed were about i} ampere.        Much more
  powerful currents could not be passed for the necessary time through
  the suspended coil without risk of undue heating.            Had it been
  desirable to use stronger currents,      it would,  of course, have been
  possible to do so by the use of thicker wire. With given grooves to
  be <U+FB01>lled up, the ratio of the electromagnetic attraction to the heat
  developed is independent of the gauge of the wire; and the only
  further modi<U+FB01>cation required would be the multiplication of the <U+FB01>ne
  copper wires by which the <U+FB02>exible connexions are made.
     Thirteen determinations of the ratio of the square root of the
  double attraction of the coils to the rate of silver deposit gave
  numbers ranging from 24137 to 24155, mean 24114445; whence,
  after introduction of the constant of the apparatus, the value of the
  electrochemical equivalent in G.G.S. measure is found to be—
                                    '0111794.
  In terms of practical       units,   we have as the quantity      of silver
  in grams deposited per ampere per hour——
                                      40246.
     With use of this number, itis now easy to determine by the deposit
  of silver currents up to 1% ampere.      For currents of greater power it
  is necessary either to increase the size of the (3-inch) platinum basins
  serving as voltameters, or to dispose several such in multiple are. For
  ordinary practical purposes, many of the precautions which we
  thought it necessary to adopt may be dispensed with.         The deposits,
  after a  few rinsings with   distilled water, may be left to soak for an
  hour, and then, after a further rinsing, dried off over a spirit lamp.
  In an hour’s time, the basin may be weighed correctly to a few tenths
  of a milligram.    With regard to the materials, it is suf<U+FB01>cient to use
  for the anodes a sheet of ordinary <U+FB01>ne silver (such as is sold at 5s.
  per ounce), and a 15 or 30 per cent. solution of nitrate.      It is hoped
  that this method may come into general use for the veri<U+FB01>cation of
  current-measuring instruments, whose indications depend upon the
  constancy of springs, or of steel magnets. Silver presents so many
  advantages as compared with copper, that its greater cost should not
  stand in the way of its adoption, more especially as there need be no
  great waste of material.
     In view of the importance of obtaining a convenient standard of
  electromotive force, a prolonged examination has been made of a
- number of Clark cells.      Of these two patterns have been used, the
   <U+FB01>rst constructed according to the directions of Clark himself and
   of Alder Wright, with some simpli<U+FB01>cations; the second, called for

brevity the H-cell, in which the solid zinc is replaced        by a  <U+FB02>uid
amalgam.      The amalgam and the pure mercury, forming the metallic
electrodes, are placed at the bottom of two small test_tubes standing
vertically.   The electric connexion is made by platinum wires sealed
through the bottoms, and the communication between the two
vertical tubes is through a lateral horizontal branch sealed into them.
The cell is <U+FB01>lled with sulphate of zinc solution above the level of the
horizontal branch, and can then be closed with corks. This form of
cell lends itself conveniently to experiment, as by withdrawing the
corks it is easy to observe the effect of stirring or of various
                                          -
additions.
   A large number of cells have been. compared for more than
eight months, and have behaved very satisfactorily.       The results are
sometimes anomalous for the <U+FB01>rst two or three weeks, but the values
<U+FB01>nally attained are in our experience extremely close together.
   The comparisons are made by the method of compensation. The
dzference of electromotive force of the cells to be compared is com
pensated by a known fraction of the electromotive force of other cells,
the value of which is then expressed in terms of one of the Clarks.
There would be no difficulty in obtaining still greater sensitiveness,
but it is useless to take readings closer than to T65“.
   The Clark cells possess the immense practical advantage (as com
pared, for instance, with Daniell’s) of standing always ready for use,
but the objection is sometimes expressed that they polarise greatly on
the passage of the smallest currents.    Our experience has been in the
opposite direction, and has shown     that  moderate short-circuiting is
actually advantageous in the case of cells newly set up. When old cells,  _
which have reached their permanent condition, are allowed to make
<U+FB01>l<U+FB01>    ampere for a quarter of an hour, the disturbance thus occasioned
passes off in about half an hour to within a few ten-thousandths, and
on the next day there is no indication of any residual effect.
   The absolute determinations of the              of Clark’s cells were
made by compensation       with  the  difference  of  potentials at the
terminals of a known resistance traversed by a known current.         The
details of the method, which olfers no special dif<U+FB01>culty, are given in
the paper.      Of thirteen values, found on different days between
October, 1883, and April. 1884, with the current measuring apparatus,

the E.M.F. of a certain cell at 15° in terms of BA. volts. To get the
E.M.F. in true volts, the mean number (1'4542) must be multiplied by
the number expressing the B.A. unit of resistance in absolute measure.

XI. “Preliminary       Note on the Constant of Electromagnetic
       Rotation of Light in Bisulphide of Carbon.” By LORD
       RAYLEIGH, D.C.L. Received June 18, 1884.
   In connexion with other work upon current measurement by Mrs.
Sidgwick and myself, we have endeavoured to determine the value of
this constant, so as to decide between the very discrepant results
arrived at by Gordon" and by H. Becquerel.1'             The method adopted
by   us   was  so far  similar    to  that   of   Gordon   that the tube of
bisulphide of carbon was placed inside a helix, but the value of the
current traversing the helix was determined in a different manner
without reference to terrestrial magnetism.
   The light employed was that emitted by sodium. When it is
remembered that the effect would vary about two parts per thousand
in passing from one sodium line to the other, the importance of
de<U+FB01>niteness in this respect will be obvious.
   The number of turns in the helix is 3684, and the insulation was
submitted to severe tests.
   In carrying out the measurements the principal di<U+FB01>ticulty en
countered was from optical disturbance arising from the communica
tion of heat from the helix to the bisulphide.             Not only does the
mean temperature of the bisulphide rise somewhat rapidly during a
series of experiments, but on account of the tendency of the warmer
parts to <U+FB01>nd their way to the top of the tube, the light is sensibly
diverted from its proper course.        It is believed that by a modi<U+FB01>cation
of 'the apparatus about to be tried, this source of embarrassment will
be materially checked.
   The plane of polarisation was determined in some experiments by a
Nicol read in two positions, and in others by a double image prism
read in four positions.     The adjustment of the match between the
two parts of the <U+FB01>eld presented by the half-shade apparatus was
facilitated by a device that may be found useful.          In addition to the
principal helix, the tube was embraced by an auxiliary coil of
insulated wire, through which could be led the current from a
Leclanché cell. This current was controlled by a reversing key
under the hand of the observer, who was thus able to rock the plane
of polarisation backwards and forwards through a small angle about
                            1' “ Phil. Trans.,” 1877.

 its normal position.       The    amount    of the rocking     being  suitably
chosen, the comparison of the three appearances (two with             auxiliary
current and one without) serves to exclude some imperfect              matches,
that might otherwise have been allowed to pass.
    On <U+FB01>fteen days sets of observations have been taken of the double
rotation produced by the reversal of the current in the helix on light
which traversed the tube three times. The double rotations varied
from about 9° to 19°, and the currents from about § ampere to
 1 ampere.      Reduced to correspond with a certain standard current,
and corrected for temperature by Bichat’s formula to 18° 0., the
 double rotations ranged from 11241 minutes to 11322 minutes.
 The mean for 18° C. is 11284 minutes; and as this was about the
actual mean temperature of the observations, the result is nearly
independent of Bichat’s formula for the dependence of the effect upon
temperature.
    Four sets  of observations were also taken on light which traversed the
tube but once. Multiplied by 3, and reduced to the same temperature
and current, the mean of these gives 1127'41 minutes. In this case the
current actually used was about 1% ampere, and the double rotation
 about 9°.
    Taking both series of experiments into account, we may adopt
 1128'0 minutes as the sixfold rotation at 18° 0. due to the passage of
the standard current through the helix.
    In C.G.S. measure the value of the standard current is ‘09722.
 The difference of magnetic potentials at points at in<U+FB01>nity on the axis
 of the helix traversed by this current is
                              41;- X 3684 x '09722.
     The correcting factor on account of the <U+FB01>nite length of the tube is
 '99449.
    Hence  if a: be the rotation in minutes at 18°    (1., corresponding to a
difference   of potential equal to unity, we have
                1128'O=6 X '09722 x 47 x 3684 X '99449 X      :0,
whence
                               no: '042002 minute.
   M. Becquerel gives      as his result  for 0° C. '0463 minute. To <U+FB01>nd
the rotation at 18°, this must be multiplied by '9767 according to
Bichat’s formula: and as Becquerel’s observations were in fact made
at about 18°, this reduction does not introduce, but rather removes,
an extraneous element.        Thus according to Becquerel—
                                a1='0452 minute,    .

    The comparison with Gordon is more uncertain, inasmuch as his
 observations were made on light of the refrangibility of the thallium
 line. The corrected‘ result for this light is in circular measure
 1'5238X10'5, or '05238 minute.             To pass to sodium we may use a
formula given by Becquerelf            and    Verdet according to which the
rotation for different wave-lengths (7t) is proportional to a’ (fig—1)X_2,
 14 being the refractive      index. At this rate the '05238 minute for
thallium would be 041623 minute for sodium. The temperature was
not directly observed by Gordon, but was estimated to be about 13° C.
Assuming this to be correct, the value for 18° would be '0413
minute, or about 2 per cent. less than according to my determina
tions.
XII.    “ Certain Points in connexion with the Physiology of Uric
      Acid.” (Supplemental) By ALFRED BARING GARROD, M.D.,
      F.R.S. Received June 19, 1884.
                                     (Abstract)
    One of the objects of the present paper is the correction of an
error of interpretation in the author’s communication of February
15th, 1883.     Another object is to make known certain facts which he
has ascertained in seeking to correct the same.
    The author hopes, 1st, to give a true explanation of the phenomena
previously misinterpreted; 2ndly, to make known some facts hitherto
unknown, whence arose the error in question; and 3rdly, to show
the existence of certain peculiarities in the urine of herbivorous
mammals, with regard to uric acid, which peculiarities the author
anticipated, so that he was led to undertake numerous experiments
and observations with the object of verifying or disproving such
anticipations.
    The subject discussed in Part        I is the in<U+FB02>uence of alkaline carbo
nates upon uric acid.          Many experiments are detailed, and, as a,
result it is found that weak solutions of the alkaline carbonates,
when exposed to the air, possess the power of decomposing uric acid
in solution, and that oxalic acid and urea are among the products of
the decomposition.       By the recognition of this fact certain physio
logical phenomena in relation to the urine can be explained.
    Part  II is devoted to the demonstration of the action of glycocine
 (glycocoll) and a few other substances in protecting uric acid from
       * Mr. Gordon’s result   was originally given at double its proper value.

decomposition when in an alkaline solution.       Glycocinc is shown to
have a very considerable power, even when in small quantities, such
as {a per cent. of the solution.      It was this fact which led to the
misinterpretation     of certain phenomena in the author’s paper of
1883; for it was found that in a glycocine solution no change of
uric acid took place; whereas, in a solution of hippuric or benzoic
acid, decomposition readily ensued; and, as the in<U+FB02>uence of weak
alkaline carbonates was not then recognized, the destructive action
was attributed to these acids.
    It will be seen that, in a free state, glycocine protects uric acid,
but when in union with benzoic acid (in the form of hippuric acid)
its protective power is lost.
   The different protective powers of glucose and cane-sugar are
alluded to.
   Part   III  treats of the urine of the herbivorous mammal under
different conditions.    It occurred to the author that, if at any time
the urine of such animals should lose its ordinary alkaline, state and
become acid, at such time uric acid would probably be found.
   Twenty-<U+FB01>ve specimens of urine derived from nine different horses
were examined; besides which many other specimens, from ten
different horses, were tested, simply to ascertain the reaction of the
urine.
   The tests employed to demonstrate the presence of uric acid are
fully described under each examination, and some of the more im
portant characters of the urine are given.
    In eighteen di<U+FB01>erent horses the urine was found to be acid in two
only, and even in these two the acidity of the urine was by no means
constant, as each of them passed, at times, an urine which was fully
 alkaline in reaction.
    Many conclusions are drawn from the above observations, among
 which it is found that the character of the food does not necessarily
 in<U+FB02>uence the reaction of the urine; neither does the state of
 health; it is also found that almost all the urines had oxalate
 deposits; most of them contained an abundance of calcium carbo
 nate, and all the urines examined were rich both in urea and in
 hippuric acid.
    Of the results brought out, by far the most interesting is that
 which has regard to the presence or absence of uric acid; for it is
 shown that there is an abSence of uric acid from the urine of the
 horse, when the reaction is alkaline, as it ordinarily      but on the
                                                              is,
 other hand,       it equally proved‘that, when the urine of the horse
                        is
 exhibits an acid reaction, then uric acid    present in quantities equal
                                              is
 to what      found in the urine of carnivorous mammals, as the lion
              is
 and the tiger.
      It also shown that the presence or absence of uric acid does not

 depend on any peculiarity in the animal, but simply on the reaction
 of its urine at the time.
    The original view of the author, which led to his making the
 numerous observations above mentioned, which also he enunciated in
 his communication of February, 1883, appears to be fully veri<U+FB01>ed by
 them; and the conclusion may fairly be drawn that, under ordinary
 circumstances, the absence of uric acid from the urine of the adult
 horse is not due to the non-formation of this acid, but to the destruc
tion which it undergoes when formed, so that, if at anytime the
 destructive in<U+FB02>uence is removed by the <U+FB02>uid assuming an acid reac
tion, uric acid appears in the urine.
    Lastly, we may derive from the above observations an explanation
of the fact that uric acid is present in the urine of the suckling
herbivorous mammal, for in such animals the urine is found to be
acid in reaction.
XIII. “A      Redetermination of the Atomic Weight of Cerium.”
       By HENRY ROBINSON, B.A., Assistant to the Professor of
       Chemistry in the University of Cambridge. Communicated
       by Professor LIVEING, F.R.S. Received June 11, 1884.
    Having worked    a good deal  during the last few years on the pre
paration of pure compounds of the cerium and yttrium metals,        I was
led to seek some method by which I might obtain their anhydrous
chlorides in such a state of purity that it would be possible to make
from them redeterminations of the atomic weights of the metals.        In
                  I
April last year, succeeded in preparing anhydrous cerium chloride
(and in this paper I shall con<U+FB01>ne myself to that metal) by passing
dry hydrochloric acid gas over what I may call air-dry cerium
oxalate, heating it at <U+FB01>rst gently, so as not to char‘the oxalate, and
then, as the operation proceeded, increasing the temperature to
a full red heat.        The chloride so obtained was perfectly white,
and, when thrown into water, dissolved, with a hissing noise and a
considerable evolution of heat, to a clear and colourless solution.     I
                                                                  I
obtained the chloride so easily on the <U+FB01>rst attempt, I supposed could
repeat the experiment at will, but such did not prove to be the case,
and, being much occupied with other duties, not much more was
done towards the attainment of my object until the commencement of
the present year.     I  had previously prepared a considerable quantity
of pure   cerium  oxalate, in the following manner, from a crude yellow
sulphate obtained from Schuchardt. It contained much didymium and

1884.]                the Atomic Weight of Cerium.                    151
a.  smaller quantity of lanthanum, besides other metals.           About
250 grms. of the crude material were taken at once, and the lumps
were broken down in a mortar, then it was transferred to a <U+FB02>ask of
about 3 litres capacity and 100 cub. centims. of strong nitric acid were
added to it, afterwards gradually water until the bulk was about
3 litres.    After shaking frequently for a day, it was allowed to settle
all night, and next morning the clear liquid was siphoned into
another <U+FB02>ask. Any undissolved was left in the <U+FB02>ask to go on with
the next lot, to be treated in the same way. The clear liquid which
had been siphoned o<U+FB01> was saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen, then
<U+FB01>ltered    from the reddish-brown    precipitate thrown down.     To the
<U+FB01>ltrate oxalic acid was added, until there was no further precipitate
formed; the precipitated oxalate was allowed to settle down, and the
clear liquor was siphoned off and thrown away. The oxalate was
then well washed with water made slightly acid with nitric acid on a
<U+FB01>lter, using a Bunsen pump, dried over a water-bath, and then ignited.
The oxides thus obtained were dissolved in nitric acid, the solution
was transferred to a dish and evaporated down on a water-bath to a
thick syrup, until it would scarcely pour from the basin. It was then
transferred to two large beakers, each containing 1500 cub. centims.
of boiling dilute sulphuric acid—20 cub. centims. of sulphuric acid,
sp. gr. 1'84 in 1000 cub. centims. of water—well stirred and allowed
to settle.    There was a considerable precipitate of basic cerium sul
phate; after it had settled down well, the clear liquid was siphoned
off, precipitated with oxalic acid, and the above process was exactly
repeated to obtain more of the basic cerium sulphate.       After siphon
ing elf as much as possible of the clear liquid from the second preci
pitate, both precipitates were thoroughly drained together on a <U+FB01>lter
at a Bunsen pump, and washed with dilute sulphuric acid. The
washings and the clear liquid from the second precipitate were pre
cipitated with oxalic acid, and the oxalates obtained, principally of
didyminm and lanthanum, were reserved for further treatment.
   Bunsen’s process was now to dissolve the basic sulphate, and re
precipitate as such, repeating the process until he obtained a small
quantity of the pure sulphate; but     I found it better from this stage
to adopt Gibbs’s method of treatment with lead peroxide.         Accord
ingly I dissolved the washed and drained basic sulphate in strong
nitric acid, added to the solution some lead peroxide, and boiled the
whole until a small quantity of the solution diluted with water gave
no precipitate with barium nitrate.       If properly done, the cerium
was now peroxidised and in solution as nitrate.       I now allowed the
excess of lead peroxide and the lead sulphate formed during the pro
cess to settle down, then decanted the clear liquid into an evaporating
basin, and heated it on a water-bath until it became a thick syrup.
This syrup was treated with boiling dilute nitric acid—~25 cub.

from the <U+FB01>lter-paper, transferred to an evaporating basin, and
thoroughly heated on a water-bath until quite dry and hard, then
broken up with a pestle in the dish, again set on the water-bath and
heated, and, while there, drenched with boiling dilute nitric acid of
the same strength as that used before. It was kept hot on the water
bath for some time and constantly stirred, then, after standing a
short time, the greater part of the nearly clear supernatant liquor was
poured away and the precipitate transferred to a <U+FB01>lter, where it was
drained by means of the pump and thorOughly washed with dilute nitric
acid until some of the basic nitrate taken from the <U+FB01>lter and dissolved
in hydrochloric acid, so as to make a very concentrated solution, showed
no trace of the didymium absorption-bands.         \Vhen this point was
reached the basic cerium nitrate containing a little lead was removed
from the <U+FB01>lter and put in a <U+FB02>ask, hydrochloric acid was added, and
the whole heated on a water-bath until the nitrate was converted into
chloride and dissolved.       The greater part of the excess of hydro
chloric acid was evaporated away, as the oxalate of cerium, to be
obtained subsequently, was found to be rather soluble when much of
that acid was present.     The cerium chloride was dissolved in water
and the solution saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen, then <U+FB01>ltered
from the lead sulphide ; the <U+FB01>ltrate was boiled to get rid of the sul
phuretted hydrogen, and again <U+FB01>ltered to remove the small quantity
of sulphur which separated out. The warm solution was then satu
 rated with chlorine, and left to stand all night, so that if any iron
was present it might be peroxidised.       The cerium was then precipi
tated from the acid solution by well puri<U+FB01>ed oxalic acid; the oxalate
was allowed to settle down thoroughly, and the clear liquor was
poured away. After several washings by decantation, using a dilute
solution of hydrochloric acid containing about 2 per cent. of hydro
chloric acid, the oxalate was transferred to a funnel which held a
perforated platinum plate in its neck, and well washed with boiling
water, then dried on the water-bath.                               I
                                          All the cerium oxalate have
used in my experiments was prepared in the way just described.
When I had obtained a su<U+FB02>icient quantity, the whole was well mixed
in a mortar and then placed in a rather loosely stoppered bottle.
From time to time a quantity suf<U+FB01>cient for each experiment was
taken from this bottle.            I
                            When had prepared all the pure oxalate I
required,  I  hit accidentally on a simpler mode of separating cerium
from lanthanum and didymium.         Instead of precipitating the cerium

  1884.]                the Atomic weight of Ce<U+FB02>um.                   153
  as basic sulphate,  I  evaporated the solution of the mixed nitrates of
  cerium, lanthanum, and didymium, obtained in the <U+FB01>rst instance, to
  complete dryness; then heated the brown mass over a naked <U+FB01>ame
  until the brown colour entirely disappeared, and the residue became
  a pale yellow.     On treating this yellow residue with boiling dilute
  nitric acid, the whole of the lanthanum and didymium was dissolved,
  and nearly all the cerium was left as basic nitrate.
     When preparing the chloride      I weighed out for each experiment
  about 10'5 grms. of the air-dry oxalate, and put it in a rather wide
  glass tube about 18 inches long.       The tube was then placed in a
  paraf<U+FB01>n-bath and dry hydrochloric acid passed through it. The
  hydrochloric acid gas was prepared in the following way :—20 parts
  of oil of vitriol Were mixed with 8 parts of water, and the mixture
  was allowed to cool, it was then poured on to 12 parts of common
  salt. The gas is not produced when the acid is thus diluted until a
  gentle heat is applied, but when it is it comes so easily that it may
  be regulated to come at any desired rate.      The gas was <U+FB01>rst passed
  through a Woulif’s bottle containing oil of vitriol, and with three
  tubulures, the third one being connected with an apparatus for
  producing carbon dioxide, so that when necessary that gas could be
  admitted without disconnecting any part of the apparatus, next
  through two large U-tubes containing calcium chloride, then again
_ through a bottle containing oil of vitriol, and lastly through a U
  tube <U+FB01>lled with asbestos to catch any spray of sulphuric acid which
  might be produced. The gas now entered the tube containing the
  oxalate, and the excess, after passing through a sulphuric acid wash
  bottle, was absorbed in water.        Soon after the hydrochloric acid
  began to pass over the oxalate, water made its appearance at the
  exit end of the tube. When the air was expelled heat was applied to
  the bath, much water continued to come oif, and was driven away by
  heating the end of‘the tube. When the temperature of the bath rose
  a little above 120°—generally       at 123°—-the oxalic acid began to
  sublime to the end of the tube and condensed there in crystals, this
  in its turn was driven away by heating the tube. As long as oxalic
  acid was seen to come off the bath was kept between 120° and 130°,
  and all that did show itself as oxalic acid did so between these
  limits.
     Afterwards    the temperature of the bath was allowed to rise
  gradually to 200°; there was no advantage in going higher, as the
  paraf<U+FB01>n evaporated away and a gas furnace can easily be regulated to
  this temperature.      I  now transferred the substance, not yet com
  pletely converted into chloride, to another tube and continued the
  process in an ordinary gas combustion furnace.       The object now was
  to so regulate the temperature that water was kept coming olf
  without increasing the heat so rapidly as to char the oxalate left

undecomposed.     When a low red heat was reached a slow current of
carbon dioxide was passed in along with the hydrochloric acid to
burn the little carbon left from a small quantity of the oxalic acid
nearly always charring.    When the slightly grey appearance of the
chloride due to this small quantity of carbon disappeared the current
of carbon dioxide was stopped, that of the hydrochloric acid was
continued for an hour longer, while the chloride was kept at a full
red heat.    With the hydrochloric acid still <U+FB02>owing over the chloride
the furnace was gradually cooled until it was safe to handle the glass
tube; the exit end of the tube was then plugged, then the other end,
and the tube was removed from the furnace and wiped clean from
the magnesia it had been lying in. The cork of the tube was then
withdrawn and the chloride slipped into the weighing <U+FB02>ask which
was securely closed by a glass cap well ground on to its neck.   It was
then quickly 'weighed while still quite warm.           The object in
weighing the chloride at this stage in the process was to make quite
sure no water was absorbed before the <U+FB01>nal weighing was made, and
such was found to be the case, for although there was always a small
increase in weight, about 00025 grm. on 6'5 grms. of the chloride, it
was no more than was easily accounted for by the loss that would
arise from weighing the body warm. When weighing the chloride it
was placed in a small <U+FB02>ask with a closely <U+FB01>tting cap and an exactly
similar <U+FB02>ask was used as a tare; the latter required the addition of
00005 grm. to balance the weighing <U+FB02>ask; whalever was doneto the
one <U+FB02>ask was always done to the other, and they were always kept
beside one another.    To avoid repetition, I may say here that in all
the other weighings the body to be weighed was placed in one vessel
and another vessel as similar in material and weight as possible was
used as a tare.   The weight having been taken, in order to remove
extraneous hydrochloric acid, the <U+FB02>ask containing the chloride, and
the tare, were placed over sulphuric acid and surrounded by quick
lime under the receiver of a large air-pump which could be exhausted
very rapidly to within 3 millims. of a vacuum.         This was usually
done during   an  afternoon, they were left here the whole of the two
following days, and on the morning of the fourth day air, dried by
passing through sulphuric acid and phosphoric anhydride, was let
into the receiver. This treatment was found to completely free the
chloride from adhering hydrochloric acid, as when it was dissolved
its solution was perfectly neutral.   The two <U+FB02>asks were now removed
from the receiver, securely closed, and the <U+FB01>nal weighing of the
chloride made ; it was then cautiously dissolved in water.
   In making the following determinations pure silver was used
prepared, according to Stas’s directions, by precipitation from an
ammoniacal solution of the nitrate by ammonium sulphite.            For
each. experiment, after making the <U+FB01>rst weighing, I calculated how

                       the   Atomic Weight of Cerium.                   155
  much silver was required to precipitate the chlorine of the cerium
  chloride, assuming at the outset the atomic weight of cerium was
  1410.     I then weighed in a porcelain crucible that quantity, less
  about 10 mgrms., and ignited it in a current of dry and puri<U+FB01>ed
  hydrogen, keeping it some time at a red heat, allowed it nearly to
 cool in hydrogen, and then heated it again nearly to redness in air.
  After cooling over sulphuric acid the silver was weighed and trans
  ferred to a 20-oz. bottle, and the empty crucible was again weighed.
  A suf<U+FB01>cient quantity of nitric acid, sp. gr. 1'42, was added to the
  silver, and the stopper of the bottle, which had been previously
  well ground in with emery, was tied down fast. The bottle was then
 placed in a water-bath, and the water was heated gradually until it
 boiled. It was kept at this temperature nearly an hour.         There was
 no escape of gas at the stopper; if the stopper ever did slip the
 silver being dissolved was rejected, and a fresh quantity was weighed.
 The solution of the silver was made some time before it was required,
 so that the bottle and contents were quite cool when opened.          After
 carefully cleaning the neck and stopper of the bottle on the outside
 the stopper was loosened and washed down into the bottle, a little
 more water was added when the silver was found to be completely
 dissolved, and the solution to be perfectly clear. The succeeding
 operations were performed in a room from which daylight was
 excluded.      The solution of cerous chloride was poured into the
 solution of silver nitrate in the bottle in which it was prepared,
 and the whole was well shaken.           The additional quantity of silver
 required for the complete precipitation of the chlorine was added by
 means of an approximately          centinormal solution of silver nitrate,
 1 grm. of which contained         001064, grm. of silver.    As I did not
 measure the quantity of the solution used but weighed       it,
                                                              I   discarded
 the ordinary forms of burette in favour of a convenient sized bulb
 which
     I      fused on toa   glass stopcock; in this shapeit  was more easily
 weighed.      The titration was made in an oblong box, divided into two
 compartments by a partition.            The inside of the box was well
 blackened.      In the partition a round hole was bored            inch in
                                                                   1%
 diameter; in the right-hand compartment a lamp was placed, and
 between  it   and the hole in the partition a    spherical <U+FB02>ask containing
a   solution of potassium chromate, so that the light from the lamp
before passing through the hole had to pass through the yellow liquid
in the <U+FB02>ask. In the left-hand compartment the bottle containing the
chloride was placed in such a position that the upper portion and
surface of the liquid it contained was illumined by the pencil of
yellow light proceeding through the hole. The burette was <U+FB01>xed in
a stand in the box, so that     it   dropped the solution of silver nitrate
into the bottle when the latter was in the best light. By this arrange
ment the slightest turbidity produced in the liquid by the silver

chloride is at once detected.                 The credit of originating it is due to
Stas. With a little practice it soon becomes easy by observing the
amount of turbidity produced by each addition of the silver nitrate
to the chloride to know how many drops may be added the next time
with safety, and as one drop of the solution of silver nitrate I used
contained only £3 of a mgrm. of silver there was not much danger of
adding an appreciable excess.
    I    have made seven determinations of the chlorine in cerous
chloride by the method               I   have just described. The mean of these
determinations gives 139'85841 as the atomic weight of cerium when
the atomic weight of hydrogen is taken as 1; if that of oxygen is
taken as 16 then the number for cerium becomes 140'2154.
    I  have taken the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of cerous chloride by weighing it
in carefully puri<U+FB01>ed benzene, and                   I  <U+FB01>nd it to be 3‘88 compared with
water at 15°‘5.           Then making corrections for weighing in air for
both the brass and platinum weights and for the cerous chloride,                                        I
<U+FB01>nd the atomic weight in vacuo when hydrogen is 1 to be 139'9035,
and when oxygen is 16 to be 1402593.                         I thus <U+FB01>nd the atomic weight
of cerium to be lower than Biihrig did, but I defer making comments
on the work of others who have preceded me until                                   I    have made
some determinations             of cerous     bromide.         This latter compound 1 have
already succeeded in making by passing hydrobromic acid over cerium
oxalate.
    The ratios     I  have employed in this paper are those of Stas, and are
as follows :—It' the atomic weight of hydrogen is 1, that of oxygen
is 15'96, silver is 107'66, and chlorine 35'37.
    The atomic weight of oxygen being 16, that of silver is 107'93,
and of chlorine 34457.

XIV. “The        Relation between Electric Energy and Radiation
      in the Spectrum of Incandescence Lamps." By Captain
      ABNEY, R.E., F.R.S., and Lieut.-Colonel              FESTING, RE.
      Received June 6, 1884.
   In                                 ”
       the  “Philosophical Magazine     for September,    1883, we showed
that certain relations existed between potential, current, watts (volt
amperes), and radiation in incandescence lamps, and that if p=the
potential, 0: current, w=watts, R=radiation, and a and b were con
stants, then
                           (i) v=a1>+bpt
and consequently that
                           (ii) w=p2<a+bpm
further we showed that after the carbon <U+FB01>laments attained          a certain
heat, the radiation varied directly as the energy.
                  (iii) Reg (w—m) where m is a constant.
We may incidentally mention that this relationship appears to hold
good in a properly exhausted lamp, be the <U+FB01>lament of carbon or of
platinum, or presumably of other metals. In this case the sign in
the left hand members of equations         and (ii) is changed.
   On laying down graphically the curve obtained by using the watts
as the abscissae and the radiation   as ordinates,  it was at once evident
that the straight part is an asymptote to a curve having its origin
at 0.    It might, therefore, be presumed that each individual ray
should increase in intensity in somewhat the same manner when the
energy in the <U+FB01>lament was increased, i.e., in some simple curve which
would have an asymptote.
   The result of our researches which we now communicate to the
Royal Society is that the curves for rays of ref'rangibility lower than
about X8500 are hyperbolas, and that when near the limit of visibility
the hyperbolas approach the parabolic form, the origin of the curves
moving away from the zero of energy as the rays are more refrangible.
This may be put in the form of an equation—
                             (w—m)2=kR2j_—ZR.
   When    the rays are  of very low refrangibility we have the — sign
in the equation,   “ ”l gradually diminishes as the refrangibility of the
rays increases till it becomes 0, with a still further increase it takes the

it approaches 0, after which the curves practically become parabolas.

therefore negligible; hence for all the hyperbolas, which differ appre
ciably from parabolas, we may take the zero watts for the origin of
the curve.
   We further give tables showing that the results are true with the
visual rays as measured by ordinary photometric methods.

re<U+FB02>ect both beams on to a collimating lens L, whence they fall on a.
dispersion apparatus, two spectra being formed on a screen, or in an
observing telescope.         A slice of the two spectra is taken and com
pared'side by side by means of a “split” lens. The intensity of either
spectrum can be reduced by closing one of the slits, or by placing a
rotating disk of sectors between the slit and the screen, and adjusting
the opening of the sectors till equality of illumination is attained.
The above results were obtained by the latter mode of observation.
   Table   III  shows a ray selected from the spectrum whose intensity
was also compared with a. ray of the same wave-length in the
spectrum of a gas <U+FB02>ame.                Tables IV, V, VI, and VII show the
readings made photometrically, through red and green glasses, of
different lamps, as compared with a. candle-power, the observed and
calculated intensities being shown in juxtaposition.                      It will be seen
that the coincidences are very close, and seem to justify the con
clusions we have drawn.             Table VIII is an attempt to measure the
light   as  a  whole     from    the  incandescence lamp with that of sperm
candles. The results are as near as might be expected.

           THE   NUMBERS
    Note—The      numbers attached  to the unbroken   curves indicate the turns of the
screw of the pile which de<U+FB01>ne      the  parts  of the spectrum to which the curves
respectively   refer.  The wave numbers    of these can be found by a reference to
Table   X.
     We now     come to the method we adopted in measuring the radiation
at different parts of the spectrum.*             A collimator with a lens of the
same glass as the prism was used to render the rays from the
incandescence lamps parallel before falling on the prism.                    Another
lens of the same material, <U+FB01>tted on to a camera with horizontal
swing back, received the spectrum which was focussed on the screen
of the latter. A linear and very delicate thermopile mounted on a
stand with a screen was employed ; the accompanying <U+FB01>gure will give
an idea of the instrument (<U+FB01>g. 3).            S is a polished silver slit placed in
front of the linear couples, which could be closed at will by a screw D.

the subject-matter would thereby be rendered more clear.       (July 14.)

<U+FB01>tted at the other side of the pile.   C is a tube to be connected with a
pump for exhausting the chamber in which the couples are placed,
the ends of which are the glass or other plates. There is outside
this chamber another hollow chamber through which a current of
water can be passed, the intake being by B, which is connected by an
india~rubber tube P to the water supply.        F is an ordinary pinchcock.
G is a screw of 30 turns to the inch by which the pile can be moved
along the guides QQ. The base is let into a wooden block which is
screwed down to the observing table.       It will be seen that the height
                                   FIG. 3.
 of the pile  can be adjusted.  TT, one not shown in       the <U+FB01>gure, are the
  terminals which are connected with the pile and the galvanometer.
  The face of this tbermopile was placed in the spectrum and moved
 along it, the de<U+FB02>ections of the galvanometer being noted at the
  diiferent parts for the different currents passed through the lamp.
  The slits were adjusted so as to be approximately equal to one
  another, and were kept of an aperture of about F16 inch.                The
  galvanometer used was one of very      low  resistance,  and  set  up so  as
  to be exceedingly sensitive.       The currents and potentials         were
  measured by Thomson’s graded galvanometers, but in some cases the

 1884.]      Energy and Radiation in Incandescence Lamps.                165
 potential was read by one of Siemens’ volt-meters.         In every case the
 potential was taken close to the lamp.         Grove’s cells were used to
 obtain the necessary currents.
    The unbroken lines in <U+FB01>g. 2, as we have already said, show the
 forms of the curves at different parts of the spectrum. The light
 used in this experiment was from one of the British Electric Light
 Company’s lamps.
    The <U+FB01>ducial energies measured were 150-5, 1308, 1164, 93'8, and
 336 watts.      From these the hyperbolas were calculated. Table IX
 gives the calculated and observed de<U+FB02>ections, from which <U+FB01>gs. 3 and 4:
 were constructed, and also 'the total radiation as observed on the
thermopile.      The observed and calculated radiations for di<U+FB02>'erent
parts of the spectrum agree very closely.
    The wave-lengths corresponding to the position of the thermopile
at different turns of the screw in this case were as follows :—

   These, as well as the wave-lengths shown in the other tables, were
obtained by taking photographs of substances giving lines which
have previously been mapped.        The back of the pile was covered
with thick felt, and kept at a constant temperature by means of ice.
A screen was placed in front of the slit. No radiation hence fell on
the apparatus except for the instant required to cause the needle to
swing.
   In <U+FB01>g. 2 the dotted    line shows the results obtained by measuring
the total energy of radiation from the lamp.           It will be seen by a
reference to our paper (“Proc. Roy. Soc.,” vol. 35, p. 328) of 1883.

scence    lamps as measured by the thermopile is very small com
pared with that of the dark rays, in fact is almost negligible, and
from <U+FB01>g. 2 it will be seen that after a very few watts of electrical
energy, the intensities of the rays which radiate most energy increase
directly proportionally to the number of watts expended, and hence
that their integration is also directly proportional to the number of
 watts expended.
                                                                   5;“
     Further for any slight deviation from the straight line in  the<U+FB01>t
  refrangible rays there is a deviation in the opposite direction in the
  rays of very low refrangibility. These apparently counterbalance one
  another, and hence we have the total radiation becoming a straight
  line.
     It now becomes of interest to determine the thermogram of the
  radiation for di<U+FB02>erent electrical energies expended in the <U+FB01>lament,
  and such are given in <U+FB01>g. 4.

   The radiation from different carbon <U+FB01>laments gave almost iden
tically the   same results, whether the surface was bright or whether
the <U+FB01>lament was dead black, a result for which we were not quite
prepared.      For owing to the kindness of Messrs. Woodhouse and
Rawson, who specially prepared a lamp, we were able to compare
the two legs of a <U+FB01>lament, one of which was bright and the other
dead black, though the resistance per unit of length was the same,
and the legs were in fact identical except in this respect.               The bright
leg of the loop radiated visible radiation much more freely than the
dead black leg, and we therefore expected to <U+FB01>nd a larger proportion
of dark rays in the spectrum. As before stated, such was not the
case, and we found that the bright <U+FB01>laments were able to stand a
higher temperature than the dull <U+FB01>laments before giving out.
Table XI shows the result with a <U+FB01>lament having a metallic lustre,
whilst that of which Table IX is a record was jet black. Tables                  XII
and   XIII    give respectively the wave-lengths and the constants k
and l of this lamp.

 The radiation curves of the two spectra are similar in every respect,
 showing that the energies of the rays at different parts of the
spectrum bear the same proportion in the two cases.                                   We have

together with the total radiation observations, and it will be seen in
<U+FB01>g. 5 that the curve becomes a straight line after the expenditure of
about 3 watts of electrical energy. We may, therefore, conclude from
these experiments that bright or dull carbon and platinum behave
similarly to one another in every respect as regards quality of

the maxima is produced below the last observed thermogram.                                    This

production was e<U+FB01>ected by calculating the position of maxima. from
the hyperbolas calculated in Table IX.               It will be noticed that the
maxima rapidly recede towards the lower limit of refrangibility, and
at just invisible heat the maximum lies near 18,000.
   When a <U+FB01>lament is at a constant temperature the energy required
to maintain it at such must of necessity be expended, either by
radiation, by heating matter in immediate contact with it, which in
this case is gas in a state of extreme tenuity, by conduction, or by
an internal loss.* If there be no expenditure of energy by anything
except radiation, it is manifest that this would increase in exact
proportion to the energy shown in the <U+FB01>lament. Now we have seen
that the radiation is not thus strictly proportional to the expended
electrical energy, but that from the <U+FB01>rst we have energy unaccounted
for by radiation, which gradually increases up to a certain point and
then becomes constant. The question arises as to what cause this can
be due.      A reference to <U+FB01>g. 2 will show that convection currents
either inside or outside the lamp are not the cause.              We have in this
<U+FB01>gure the analysis of the radiation for different parts of the spectrum,
and it will be seen that the rays of low refrangibility have curves
which are concave to the axis of abscissae, whilst for the rays of
higher'refrangibility the curves are convex to the same axis. Now
if convection currents caused this palpable concavity in the curves
from rays of low refrangibility, we ought to be able to measure their
radiation as total radiation from the lamp when the direct radiation
of the :<U+FB01>lament itself is cut off. As a matter of fact the total
radiation from the globe and surrounding air was immeasurable on
the thermopile.         Thus the radiation from the heated gas inside,
and the heated air outside the lamp, and from the glass globe itself,
were inappreciable.          The former might, perhaps, be expected if the
lamp-black with which the face of the pile was coated did not absorb
the particular radiations emitted from them. If the total radiation
from the glass globe and its surroundings was not measurable, much
less could it be anticipated that the galvanometer needle would be
de<U+FB02>ected when such radiation was distributed through the spectrum,
more especially as the rays falling on the prism proceeded from a very
narrow section of the lamp (including the <U+FB01>lament) lying on a plane
passing through the slit and along the axis of the collimator.                   We
<U+FB01>nd, however, that in this case the curves of radiation of the rays of
low refrangibility are concave, whilst those of higher are convex to
the horizontal axis. This would imply, if the cause of the convexity of
the total radiation curve lies outside the <U+FB01>lament (since it has been
shown that the radiation from the globe and surroundings is inap
  * Any   apparent   loss in radiation due to the lamp-black on the thermopile not
absorbing  radiation may be dismissed, as the loss will be shown to occur in the rays
of high refrangibility which it is known are absorbed by lamp-black.

172       Energy and Radiation in Incandescence Lamps.          [June   19,
preciable), that the rays of high refrangibility are more absorbed or
used up than those of low refrangibility, which is quite contrary to
all our knowledge of the laws of absorption. We are, therefore, obliged
to look to the <U+FB01>lament itself for the cause of' the convexity.   We know
that in a carbon <U+FB01>lament resistance diminishes as the temperature is
raised, whilst in a platinum wire the resistance increases under the
same circumstances.     In both cases this implies a re-arrangement of
the molecules of the carbon or platinum and the consequent using up
of energy. It seems that this might be the reason of the form of the
curves. If it be so, then as the radiation from a <U+FB01>lament varies as
the surface, and the alteration in molecular arrangement varies as
the mass, we ought to <U+FB01>nd that in excessively <U+FB01>ne <U+FB01>laments the con
vexity is much diminished, and that the radiation curve is practically
a straight line starting from the origin.   This is found to be the case
in some <U+FB01>laments as <U+FB01>ne as those made by Edison.          It should also be
noticed that from the part where the radiation curve becomes straight,
the resistance of the <U+FB01>laments changes but very slowly.
   We have specially made these remarks, since in a paper read before
the British Association at Southport, the late Sir William Siemens
took exception to our regarding convection currents as being absent,
and stated that these currents were imparted to the air outside the
lamps. This objection is theoretically valid, but practically it is of
no moment. We propose to examine this more fully subsequently.
   A point now arises in regard to this research which is of import
ance in photometric measurement.       If the intensities of radiations of
a ray, say in the red of the spectrum of an incandescence lamp as
produced by two known electrical energies, are compared with the
corresponding radiations (say) of a candle, and if then the intensities
of a second ray, say in the green, are also compared, the number of
watts necessary to produce any temperature in whichv the same red
and green rays bear a known proportion to the same rays in a candle
<U+FB02>ame may be found by a simple calculation.              If the thermopile
be used, the same procedure may be adopted, in which case it would
be advisable to use rays in the invisible spectrum of low refrangi
bility.  For this, of course, the prism must be used with judgment,
and after its constants have been properly determined, which we
have found no dif<U+FB01>culty ourselves in doing.          With a grating the
de<U+FB02>ections on the galvanometer are much smaller, and the errors of
observation are consequently likely to be proportionally larger than if
the large de<U+FB02>ections as given when using a prism are employed. Then,
again, too, in using a re<U+FB02>ection-grating, certainty must be obtained
that the intensity of the spectra follows the theoretical law, or at all
events it must be ascertained what is the deviation from it.      This is a
point that Professor Rowland has exempli<U+FB01>ed practically, as he has
 produced gratings in which the intensity of spectra on each side of

varies  as to qu, where m and g are constants and T the temperature.

    Fig. 1 shows the cell in plan, and <U+FB01>g. 2 the same in section. The
 outer containing vessel is a large shallow tray of wood, very strong,
 but quite roughly made, and lined with sheet lead. The tray is

 3%  inches deep, and with this small depth the lead can be beaten in,
 and autogenous soldering is unnecessary. The lead tray is very care
 fully varnished with spirit varnish, several coats being applied; and
 on the bottom of it is laid a thin sheet of copper (0'2 millim. thick),
 or rather several sheets thoroughly connected together, as     I have not
been able to obtain a single sheet of copper large enough for my
purpose. The copper sheet, varnished on the lower side, is attached
in many places to the lead lining of the trough by soldered slips of
copper, the solderings being thoroughly coated with varnish or marine
glue. This copper sheet forms the copper plate of the Daniell’s cell.
    The zinc of the cell consists of four of an unusually large size
 (56 centims., 22 inches square) of the gridiron zines used in Sir William
Thomson’s well-known tray Daniell, which is largely employed at most
of the submarine telegraph stations in connexion with the Siphon
Recorder, and is a modi<U+FB01>cation of the constant Daniell’s battery
described “Proc. Roy. Soc," 1871, p. 253.        These gridiron zines rest
on small blocks of wood at the four corners of each, and they are con
nected together by strong copper slips at the corners, and by means
of two diagonals of thick copper rod which are soldered at the out
lying corners and at the four meeting corners in the middle of the
square.

terminated with two copper slips, which are pushed on over the piece
ll and held on by indiaerubber bands.
   The mode of supplying the cell with sulphate of copper still remains
to be described, and         this which constitutes its most important
                             it   is
peculiarity.    The liquid contained ordinarily in the tray Danielle          is
somewhat dilute solution of sulphate of zinc (sp. gr. 1'12 to 1'14),
the lowest layer of which      saturated with sulphate of copper. The
                                   is is
sulphate of zinc solution     kept at the proper density by occasionally
drawing o<U+FB02>f quantities of strong liquor and replacing by pure water,
testing by a hydrometer or with speci<U+FB01>c gravity beads.          The sulphate
of copper      supplied by dropping
               is                     a proper quantity of blue vitriol in
crystals into the cell round the edges.       This is suf<U+FB01>ciently easy when
the cells are of moderate dimensions, and where a large number of
them  is being constantly used and regularly attended to in a business
like way, as at a telegraph station. When, however, the size of the
tray is very large, and when the cell       being used intermittently, this
                                                 is
simple   method   becomes  dif<U+FB01>cult  and   unsatisfactory;   and, owing to
want of uniformity of the solutions, the cell       rarely
                                                        is obtained   in such
a condition as to be ready to give the results which ought to be
expected from it. The copper sulphate supplied in crystals does not
dissolve suf<U+FB01>ciently quickly and spread itself over the whole surface
of the lower plate, and dif<U+FB01>culties arise as to the dilution of the
sulphate of zinc without stirring up from the (bottom remnants of
unused sulphate of copper.
   To avoid these troubles, and to make the starting and stopping of
the action of the cell easy and rapid,       have arranged to supply the

delivering to the various parts of the bottom of the cell.      The vessels
X    and Y are furnished each of them with a shelf of thin sheet
copper perforated with many holes, the level of the shelf being con
siderably above the level of the extremities of the siphon tubes.        On
these shelves a large quantity of sulphate of copper in crystals is
placed.
    To raise the vessels X and Y up, and cause the siphons to run, two
boards are provided which are pushed in beneath the vessels.         One of
these, mm, is shown beneath the vessel X in the <U+FB01>gures.         The boards
are made of exactly the proper thickness to cause a layer of chosen
depth to be run into the cell out of the vessels, or out of the cell
into the vessels, according as the vessels are raised up on the boards
or are lowered down when the boards are removed. The thickness
of the boards depends, of course, on the relative sectional areas of
the two vessels and of the cell. The depth of the layer which is
spread over the bottom of the cell should be not more than one
                      '
eighth of an inch.      The bottom of the cell must be very carefully
levelled  in order that the layer of charged liquor may be uniformly
distributed, and that the half-spent liquor may be uniformly drawn
off.
   In setting up the cell in the <U+FB01>rst instance    I commence   with the cell
charged with weak solution of sulphate of zinc (sp. gr. 1‘12), while
the vessels X and Y are charged with nearly saturated sulphate of
zinc solution.   This liquor is still able to take up every large quantity
of sulphate of copper; and water saturated with both sulphate of
zinc and sulphate of copper is much more dense‘than saturated solu
tion of either salt alone. When the cell is to be started the two
reservoirs are raised into position.      The thin layer of dense liquor
spreads itself over the bottom in a few minutes, and the cell is ready
for use.     When the use of the cell is to cease the reservoirs are
lowered down, and nearly the whole of the dense liquor runs back
into them. This should always be done at night, or during any con
siderable time when the cell is to be out of use.
   During the action of the cell sulphate of zinc is constantly being
formed, and it is necessary frequently to run off a portion of the con
tents of the cell and <U+FB01>ll up with pure water.        I have planned for a
system of tubes (arranged similarly to those    just described) for siphon
ing o<U+FB01> into independent     vessels, and with a cell of very great dimen
sions, such as I am  now constructing, they will probably be necessary.
With the cell which      I have been using for nine months, however,      I
have been able to dispense with them.
   It only remains for me to give the dimensions of the cell now in
use, and of“ a new one in process of construction.         The tray of the
former is 47 inches square inside measurement, and 3% inches deep.

this cell I  can command about 45 amperes for hours together at any
time, only requiring to take, now and then, a fresh supply of sul
phate of copper from the reservoirs. The new cell which is in process
of construction is 69 inches long by 416 inches, and 32- inches deep.
It has four reservoirs, and six zines placed in two rows of three

   P.S.-—In the foregoing paper,     I  have described the construction
and capability of a cell, whose dimensions are given, constructed
about the beginning of July, 1883.       It was found necessary, almost
whilst I was writing, to take the cell to pieces, as it had become blocked
up with copper deposited in the natural course of nine months’
working. In putting the cell together again, with attention to small
particulars, which I shall not describe as they will naturally occur to
anyone who desires to use the arrangement, but which,        I need scarcely
remark, make, with such great currents, all the di<U+FB01>erenoe between
success and non-success,     I have obtained, through a current galvan

after it has been passing for a suf<U+FB01>ciently long time for the wire to

The resistance of the wire becomes increased as the temperature
rises, and from the increase of resistance the increase of temperature
can be calculated.

                                        a
through the line consisting of the copper and the German silver wire,
and by means of a sensitive re<U+FB02>ecting galvanometer of high resistance
the differences of potentials at the two ends of AB, the copper wire,
and of BC, the German silver wire, were determined (<U+FB01>g. 1). The ratio
between these di<U+FB02>erences of potentials   the same as the ratio between'
                                            is
the resistances of AB and BC. Then, BC, the standard of German
silver, being known, the resistance of AB was calculated.      This
experiment, therefore, gave the resistance of AB cold.
   A much more powerful current was then caused to <U+FB02>ow through
the line, and was kept up for a suf<U+FB01>cient time until AB had taken a
permanent temperature.     The terminals of the potential galvano
meter were again applied, and the differences of potentials at the
extremities of AB and of BC once more determined, and thus the
ratio of their resistances. If the resistance of BC had remained
absolutely constant, the resistance of AB hot from the effect of a
current, the magnitude of which        shown by the ampere-meter, would
                                       is
now be known.      This was practically the case. The quantity of oil
surrounding the German silver wire was so considerable that the
temperature rose but little, and the change of resistance of German
silver with temperature        so small that
                              is                 was unnecessary to apply
                                                 it
any correction.    It would be easy to keep the temperature of the oil
quite constant by occasionally passing a test tube containing a little
ice or a small freezing mixture from place to place through it, and
then stirring the whole up thoroughly.
   The resistance of the copper wire <U+FB01>rst cold and afterwards hot having
been determined, and the temperature of the wire when cold being
known (as at the beginning the temperature of the wire was the same
as that of the air),   itwas easy to <U+FB01>nd the temperature of the wire
hot by applying the formula for temperature correction for the
resistance of copper.
  I    have also used, latterly, for passing a powerful current through
a. wire under experiment, and for determining        the resistance of the
wire while the current        is<U+FB02>owing, a Wheatstone’s bridge, suitably
arranged for the purpose, in accordance with          a plan suggested by
Sir William Thomson, and           <U+FB01>nd this method more sensitive and
                                   I
more generally convenient than the potential method.
   The diagram (<U+FB01>g.      2)explains the arrangement.      ABC and A'B'C
are the two branches of the Wheatstone’s bridge, and the four con
ductors are made up as follows: BC           the wire under experiment as

experimental wire BC.              The branch A'B'C is a single long wire
having many times the resistance of the branch ABC, and many
times the resistance of the battery used, and thus only a small portion
of the current passes through it-—a quantity, in fact, unable to heat
this branch to any appreciable extent. The testing galvanometer is
introduced between B and B', the contact at B’ being shifted about
till a “balance” is obtained; and from the position of B' on the
scale ss the ratio can be calculated between A'B' and B'C, when the

   In experimenting, the. wire BC is soldered between stout copper
slips for the purpose, shown in the diagram at its extremities, and its
resistance is taken with a very small current passing through it; the
resistance B being provided for the purpose of varying the current.
The current is then increased by diminishing the resistance B. When
this is done, the wire BC becomes heated, and its resistance increases;
but the conductor AB and the branch A'B'C remain unaltered,
though the ratio between the parts of the latter corresponding to

already, for copper and for several other substances from well-known

   My <U+FB01>rst experiments, after some preliminary trials had been made,
were on a series of copper wires, all of them cut from the same piece,
and of the same length, but some of them bare and others covered
with different insulating coatings. The wires were about No. 21 of the
old B.W.G., 0'81 millim. in diameter and half metre in length. The

     The current was in every case 10 amperes.                Increase in the
 numbers indicates increase in the resistance of the tested wire, and
 therefore increased temperature;         while decrease in the numbers
 quoted    shows  decrease   in  the   temperature.       The change in the
 permanent temperature is        not  more   than    two degrees; and the
 result of these experiments may be brie<U+FB02>y stated to be this, that
 there was exceedingly little effect in the way of keeping up the
 temperature of a No. 20 B.W.G. copper wire, about 1 millim. in
diameter, by covering it up with paper and Brunswick black till it
attains an external diameter of more than a centimetre and a half.
    A large number of experiments were tried of a kind similar to
the one just quoted, and all of them giving similar results for wires
of similar dimensions.         I  propose with improved arrangements
which     I  have now at command, to obtain numbers which                 shall
be more accurate than those which           I  have yet obtained; and to
extend the experiments to the case of wires of larger diameters.
    I  have also made some preliminary experiments on copper wires of
various diameters without solid covering, cooling in air and in
vacuum.      In commencing these experiments           I   used as a formula
for controlling my results an expression derived as follows :—
    A current passing through a given wire produces heat of which the
amount, according to the well-known formula of Joule, is given by—
                                 H=C’R/J.       . .     .   .   .  .  . .  (1),
where C is the current, R the resistance,      JJ oule's equivalent, and H

C.G.S. units. Let l he the length of the wire experimented on, and
[1 its diameter;  and let a; be the speci<U+FB01>c resistance of the substance

   Experiments have been made by Mr. D. Macfarlane (“ Proc. Roy.
$00.,” 1872, p. 93) for the purpose of determining the emissivity of
surfaces in absolute measure.      Mr. J. P. Nichol has also obtained
results, which were communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh
by Professor Tait, 1869—70; and which have been reduced to absolute

   On calculating the value of the emissivity for small copper wires
by means of the formula (4) given above,            I
                                                  have found in every
case a much greater emissivity than was obtained by these experi
                             I
menters ; and so far as have been able to go up to the present the
emissivity seems to increase as the diameters of the wires experi
mented on are diminished.     Macfarlaue’s determinations of emissivity
were made for a copper globe of      centims. diameter, and found to be
                                         4.-
about 7610-6 of the thermal unit C.G.S. per square centim. per second
per degree of difference of temperature for a polished surface with
a little over 60° of excess of temperature, and for a blackened
surface with excess of 5° or under. For round wires of small
diameter  I   have found very much larger emissivity than Elva.               I
have obtained di<U+FB01>'erent values of for wires of di<U+FB01>erent sizes, varying
                                         e

temperature 27°‘5 C., down to “1,6 with a wire of 0'40 millim., and
excess of temperature 24° C.
   In order to examine the question more thoroughly,          have com

nearly perfect vacuum obtainable with the mercurial pump, and                 I
am preparing for a more complete series of experiments.         It seems
certain that this method of experimenting will give a very accurate
 way of determining the value of          in absolute measure for the

   During the writing of this paper Professor Stokes has kindly
reminded me of the experiments made by Mr. Crookes            Proc. Roy.
                                                                 ("
 800.,” vol. 31, p. 239).  I<U+FB01>nd that my results, so far as they go, agree
 perfectly with those of Mr. Crookes, showing a decrease in the
 emissivity due to lowering the air pressure, this decrease being very
 small for reduction down to one-half or one-third of the ordinary
          a
 atmospheric pressure, but becoming very great with the almost
 perfect vacuum obtained with the mercurial pump.

  ble to accomplish this are the “ disk and roller,” and its modi<U+FB01>cation
  the disk-globe and cylinder-integrator,        or with some device which
  relies on the same principle of action.        A brief account is given of
  the applications of the disk and roller itself, which mechanism was
  <U+FB01>rst suggested by Poncelet, for integrating the products of the two
   variables in a traction ergometer, and has since been applied by
  various inventors—the disk being sometimes replaced by a cone, as
  a planimeter or platometer and integrator.
      The applications for the converse process of differentiation are less
  known, and do not appear to have been brought into successful
'
  operation.
   i A speed indicator, in which a screw replaced the usual axis of the
  roller, the roller forming the nut, was made three years ago by the
  author.       In this case the screw was driven at a speed which varied
  with the space‘passed over by the: moving body, and the disk at a
  constant speed by a clock.       The position of the roller on the disk was

then a measure of the ratio of the increase of space to that of time,
and in the limit is a measure of their differential coef<U+FB01>cient, that is
(since              a. direct measure of the velocity of the moving       body.
           v:%%)
The author afterwards found that this idea had been suggested some
time previously by a correspondent in “ Engineering.” Quite recently
(May 24th) a speed indicator on this principle, but with a cone
instead of a disk, was exhibited before the Physical Society, and at
the same meeting the Secretary himself showed the disk and roller
speed indicator which he had re-invented.
    The disk and roller has, however, two kinds of defects, which
account for its practical failure for the foregoing purpose, and render
its accuracy as an integrator almost a matter of impossibility; though
in the latter case the error for reasons which are explained is more
dif<U+FB01>cult to detect. These kinds of defects are :—
    (1.) Those which are the mechanical result of the principle of action
itself;
    (2.) The limited range of action of the instrument.
 >
    (1.) The very conditions under which the mechanism acts are con
tradictory, and are shown to lead to three special defects :-—
    (i.) Grinding action between      the edge of the roller and the face    of
              the disk.
    (ii.) Necessity for the application of force, in order to change the
              position of the roller.
    (iii.)   Error  in numerical results.
    These defects are considered, and a modi<U+FB01>cation of the disk-globe
and cylinder-indicator of Professor James Thomson, which was de
signed to obviate them, is suggested for the converse process.
    (2.) The second kind of defect led the author to modify the disk
 and roller, so that a range of action, in theory in<U+FB01>nitely great, was
obtained. This is not so easy to use, the graduation of the scale
having      to be made according      to an equation              , instead  of
                                                      y=Rm—:c
simply y=Rm, as in the <U+FB01>rst form; but it was new, and led to the
fact being made clear that there was a close analogy between these
two forms and two forms of what may be called the “ sphere and
 roller mechanism," which with certain results were communicated
 to the Physical Section of the Bristol Naturalists’ Society in November
last.
    It was the endeavour to overcome the frictional defects of the disk
and roller which still remain in this form of mechanism, and to render
 the application of the sphere and roller possible for practical pur
 poses, that led to the investigation which forms the real subject of
 the paper.

     The result has been a mechanism which consists of two distinct
                           '
features :—
   (1.) A mechanical principle, by which an arrangement of spheres
and rollers is made capable of transmitting motion, which can be
independently varied in any required manner.
   (2.) The arrangement by which mathematical results can be at
once obtained with any required numerical quantities, however large.
   The rest of the paper consists in a discussion of these principles,
and of the practical applications which, beside enabling the operations
already mentioned to be performed, enable logarithms and roots to be
calculated, besides giving a convenient computator for reducing
tables of results.
    The almost entire absence of friction enables a chain of spheres and
rollers to be employed in a very compact form and with accurate
result.    Thus, with two sets, the moment of an area, the integration
of volumes, 850., can be obtained; with three, the moment of inertia,
 and other results.    In fact, the operation

                      jh‘l(a:).F2(az)
 can be performed with n sets of the fundamental form of mechanism.
    By using the screw arrangement, the value of a ratio or di<U+FB01>erential
 coe<U+FB02>icient can .be obtained; and, by using two sets, the second dif
 ferential coef<U+FB01>cient, or
                               <U+FB01>=acceleration ’
                               dc
 or rate of change of velocity, is given. By using the integrating and
 differentiating mechanism in conjunction, rate of working, or H. P.
 can be indicated on a dial.
    Various practical applications, such as a planimeter, a sliding rule
 for giving at once A, M, and I, a H. P. indicator are shown. Finally,
 the application of the mechanism to the transmission of power is con
 sidered, as well as the mechanics of problem, and a modi<U+FB01>cation of an
 important nature for the roller bearings is described and illustrated.

   Of all the properties    possessed  by a ship none is more vital to her
safety and e<U+FB02>iciency than that of stability.       At the same time none is
dependent for its existence and amount upon so many, or such diverse
and variable, circumstances as it. The stability of a ship is regulated
and determined by her outward size and shape, and also by the separate
amounts and positions of all the weights that go to make up her
structure, equipment, and loading.        No change of any kind can be
made in dimensions or form, or in the quantities or distribution of
the various items of equipment, stores, or cargo without a<U+FB02>ecting
stability.   It is, of course, essential to the safety of every vessel that
her stability should not become reduced during all the changing
conditions of her employment and career below a certain de<U+FB01>nite
amount. The result of neglect in this respect may be a dangerous
inclination or complete capsize when unlooked for, or exceptionally
trying, emergencies occur.         De<U+FB01>cient stability, whether caused by
faulty design     or  stowage, may admit of a vessel being suddenly
capsized by the action of the wind and waves, or of her being forcibly
heeled to a dangerous angle of inclination by the shifting of some of
her internal weights, such as coals or cargo.            Although in every
vessel there is a minimum limit below which            it is not prudent or
safe to diminish the stability, it does not follow that this limit is the
same or similar in character in all sizes and types of ships.                _
 _ It is not only necessary
                                 to guard against the stability of a ship
becoming reduced below a safe minimum amount, but there is also a
maximum limit which it should not be allowed to exceed. Excessive

 206                Prof. F. Elgar.     The Variation  of
 stability has its own peculiar/objections and dangers. It causes heavy
 and uneasy rolling which may not only be uncomfortable and trying
 to passengers and crew, but at times su<U+FB01>icient to strain and even
 fracture portions of the structure, and displace or damage some of
 the <U+FB01>ttings.    The masts and rigging generally su<U+FB01>er most on account
 of their distance from the axis of rotation, and the change of motion
 in them at the end of each roll, being greater than that of any other
part of the vessel; and also because their attachment to the hull is
 less direct and secure.     The straining effect of too great stability
 often shows itself early, and in a marked manner, upon the masts and
 rigging of a vessel. Seamen frequently say of a ship that is laden with
 heavy cargo placed low down in the hold, that unless some of the
 weights are raised, i.e., unless the stability is reduced, she will roll
her masts out.       The violent and deep rolling caused by excessive
stability  also tends  to move over towards one side of the ship such
cargoes as grain or coals which are free, to some extent, to shift as a
whole; or such portions of other classes of cargo as admit of being
displaced. Speaking generally, it may be said that, whereas large
stability helps to prevent inclination to a great angle in the event
of cargo shifting, the very possession of such large stability often
increases the chances of shifting.
    The stability of a ship at a given draught of water, and with a
speci<U+FB01>c description of loading can readily be calculated, and it has
become usual to make such calculations at the Admiralty and in a
few of our leading mercantile shipyards. The practice is to construct
a curve of metacentres, which shows how the height of the meta
centre varies with draught of water, and is affected by such changes
in the external bulk and form of the immersed portion of the hull
as may be caused by increasing or diminishing the draught of water.
A curve of stability is also constructed for one or more <U+FB01>xed draughts
of water, and for certain intended, or estimated, weights and distri
butions of load.     These curves show what the righting moments for
such draughts of water and descriptions of loading amount to at
successive angles of inclination from the upright up to 90°, or to the
angle at which the stability vanishes.
    The curve of metacentres is obtained by calculating the height of
the metacentre at several <U+FB01>xed draughts of water, setting up those
heights as ordinates of a curve whose abscissae are proportional to
the corresponding draughts of water, and drawing a fair curve
through the points thus obtained.          The term “metacentre” was
originated by Bouguer,     who  published the <U+FB01>rst investigations into the
subject in his “Traité du Navire,” which appeared in 1746.            The
metacentre of a <U+FB02>oating body is the point of intersection of a vertical
line through the centre of gravity of the volume of displacement
when the body is inclined through an inde<U+FB01>nitely small angle from a

 position of equilibrium, with the vertical through the centre of gravity
  of the displaced volume in the original position of equilibrium)“
                                        FIG. 1.
 For instance, if AEF in <U+FB01>gn 1 represent the transverse section of a
 ship upon which WL is the intersection of the water-line plane when
 the vessel is upright and in a position of equilibrium, and B the
 position of the centre of gravity of the volume of displacement
 WAL—or centre of buoyancy as it is commonly called; and if AH be
the vertical through B when the vessel is <U+FB02>oating in equilibrium at
the water-line WL, then if the vessel be inclined through a small
angle WOW}, and the point Bl represent the centre of buoyancy of
 the immersed volume WIALl, the vertical BIM, drawn through B1,
 will intersect the original vertical AH in a point M. M is the meta
centre when the angle of inclination W'OW1 is inde<U+FB01>nitely small.                    It
then represents the ultimate intersection of the new vertical through
Bl with the original vertical BH. In a ship the vertical correspond
ing to the upright position of equilibrium is, for all practical purposes,
the intersection AH of the middle line longitudinal plane with the
transverse section.
    Bouguer showed that the position of the metacentre limits the
height to which the centre of gravity of a <U+FB02>oating body may be
raised without making it unstable, and that the righting moments
at small angles of inclination from a position of stable equilibrium
are proportional to the height of the metacentre above the centre of
gravity.     This is readily seen, because if G in <U+FB01>g. 1 be the position of
the centre of gravity of a ship, and GZ the horizontal distance between
'
   " It is a moot question whether the term metacentre should not be made to
embrace all the ultimate intersections of consecutive verticals through the centres of
gravity of the displaced volume.      Bouguer calls the locus of such intersections
the  metacentrl'que.

 208               Prof. F. Elgar.     The    Variation of
 G and   the vertical  through the centre of buoyancy B1, then W x GZ
 is the righting moment; W being the weight of the ship.                  But
 GZ=MG sin WOWI; and therefore when WOWl is inde<U+FB01>nitely
 small, the righting moment is proportional to WX MG.                  While
 G remains below M the moment is always a righting one, and
 tends to restore the ship to the upright position, which in this case
 is one of stable equilibrium; but if it be above M the tendency is to
 move the ship farther away from the upright till an inclined position
 of stable equilibrium be reached, or to capsize her.          The curve of
 metacentres   for a ship, which gives the height of the metacentre at
 all draughts of water, indicates therefore the limit above which the
 centre of gravity cannot be raised by changes in the amounts or
 positions of any of' the weights without causing her to become
 unstable. Su<U+FB01>icient stability for practical working requirements and
 for purposes of safety can only be secured by taking care that at the
 various displacements and draughts of water a vessel may have in
 di<U+FB01>erent conditions of loading, the centre of gravity is always kept at
 a proper'depth    below the corresponding points on the metacentric
                                             '
curve.
    Such instability as may be due to de<U+FB01>ciency, or absence, of meta
 centric height is not necessarily dangerous, and may not be suf<U+FB01>cient
 to cause a complete capsize.      It will, of course, cause the vessel to
incline away from the upright, but a position of stable equilibrium
 may. soon be reached; and the righting moments at greater inclina
tions, and the range of stability, beyond that point may be so large as
to put all danger of upsetting out of the question if there are no
openings through which water may <U+FB01>nd its way inboard, and no large
weights free to shift. Many ships are in this condition when light,
and some approach it when laden. On the other hand, there are
vessels in which small metacentric height involves a serious risk of
capsizing.
   No <U+FB01>xed distance of centre of gravity below metacentre, or meta
centric height, as it is commonly termed, can be adopted as a standard
for application to all ships, because such a measure of stability
is very imperfect and insuf<U+FB01>cient, and may by itself be misleading.
This is chie<U+FB02>y due to the reasons that the form and proportions of the
above-water part of the ship are not taken into consideration in the
metacentric calculations, and the under-water form not completely
so; and that the value, as a general measure of stability, of a given
metacentric height is largely a<U+FB01>ected by the absolute heights in a
ship of the centre of gravity and metacentre.        The initial stability is,
of  course, constant  for  a given metacentric    height whatever may be
the absolute positions of the points M and G, but the righting
moments at moderateand large angles of inclination, and the angle
at which such righting moments vanish, or change into upsetting

                  Stability with Draught   of Water in Ships.          209
moments, are largely dependent upon theabsolute position of the
latter point.      Speaking generally, it may be said that, keeping
the same distance between the metacentre and centre of gravity,
the righting moments at successive angles of inclination, and the
range of stability, are increased by lowering these points and reduced
by raising     them.
    Experience proves that some classes of vessels are as safe and
seaworthy in respect of stability with 1 foot, or even less, of
metacentric height, as others are with 3 or 4 feet; while some of an
exceptional character require much greater stability than even the
latter‘<U+FB01>gures would give.        Examples of this class are to be found
among ironclad monitors of very low freeboard and with heavy
upper works, including armoured turrets and guns on deck; and
also among paddle steamers            of extremely light draught, with
extensive tiers of houses above them. These are cases in which the
 metacentre and centre of gravity are both comparatively high in the
 ship.
     The vertical position of the metacentre of a <U+FB02>oating body is deter
 mined by the consideration that the height of the metacentre above
 the centre of gravity of the volume of displacement is equal to the
 moment of inertia of the plane of <U+FB02>otation about a longitudinal axis
 through its centre of gravity divided by the volume of displacement.

geometrical forms of <U+FB02>oating bodies possess many interesting pro
perties, but       foreign to the purpose of this paper to enter upon a
                   it   is
full discussion of them. It may, however, be noted, as additional
illustrations of these, that the ordinate of the metacentric curve at
zero, i.e., the one corresponding with no draught of water,            the                        is
radius of curvature of the transverse section of the <U+FB02>oating body
at its lowest point.     Thus, for a body of circular section the height
of the metacentre at the point where the draught vanishes           equal                       is

 with the centre of buoyancy, but if the upper surface         is bounded by a
plane   which  is  parallel to,  and coincident  with, the  water-surface, the
 curve of metacentres does not, when produced, end in the centre of
 buoyancy, as may be seen by <U+FB01>g. 3. The immersion of the plane of
 the upper surface BC causes a point of discontinuity in the curve of
 metacentres, which drops at once to the curve of centres of buoyancy.
 Curves of metacentres are given in <U+FB01>g. 7 for prismatic bodies of
triangular and elliptical sections, and for a similar body the lower
 half of whose section is elliptical and the upper half rectangular
 (<U+FB01>gs. 4, 5, and 6). The section in <U+FB01>g. 4 is an isosceles triangle with
 the base upwards and horizontal.          In <U+FB01>gs. 5 and 6 the major axis of
 the ellipse is horizontal.     A comparison of the metacentric curves in
 <U+FB01>g. 7 will show how they are affected by changes in the form of the
 <U+FB02>oating body. In the case of the triangular section the curve of
 metacentres is a straight line which passes through the immersed
 angle of the triangle.

   If the rectangular <U+FB02>oating body shown in <U+FB01>g. 2 be homogeneous,
and the changes in its depth of <U+FB02>otation be caused by merely alter
ing the density throughout, or by otherwise altering its weight so
that the position of the centre of gravity remain the same, the latter
will always be in the centre of the body. The locus of the centre of

curve LMN intersects GG' the equilibrium will be neutral.

    In actual ships the locus of the centre of gravity is not a straight
line such as GG', any more than the curve of metacentres is a hyper
bola like LMN; and the fundamental diiference exists between them in
practice, that whereas the curve of metacentres is constant for a ship,
the locus of the centre of gravity is very variable in its character.
The diagram in <U+FB01>g. 3 may serve, nevertheless, to illustrate the nature
of the problem that has to be dealt with in investigating the stability
 of ships. The curve of metacentres for a ship can be readily con
 structed by applying       Bouguer’s theorem, viz., height of metacentre
 above centre     of gravity of displaced volume: tfysdw ,where y is the
                                                               V
 half-ordinate of the plane of <U+FB02>otation and V the volume of displace
 ment. The integration of ysdx is e<U+FB01>ected by one of Simpson’s rules; 7
 and the volume of displacement and corresponding height of centre of
 gravity of displaced volume are computed by the same means.                      The
 curve of metacentres       when  once constructed is the          same   for all con
 ditions of the ship, as it can only be altered by changes in her
 dimensions or form.         In this important respect it differs entirely
 from the locus of the centre of gravity.                      ,
     The locus of the centre   of  gravity of a ship is usually very irregular,
 and is neither <U+FB01>xed in character nor position.                  It varies with dif
 ferent weights and descriptions of loading; and, unlike the curve of
 metacentres, its ordinates cannot always be expressed in terms of the

              Stability with Draught of Water in Ships.                213
depth of immersion.     What is usually done in practice, is to ascertain
the position of the centre of gravity for such conditions of loading as
may often be expected to occur; or to determine the limits between
which it will lie in certain extreme circumstances.    This variable and
uncertain factor, of height of centre of gravity, is one of the greatest
practical dif<U+FB01>culties that have to be overcome in fully or accurately
determining and regulating a ship’s stability.      The di<U+FB01>iculty is not
the same in all cases. In war-ships, for instance, and many which
merely carry passengers and light baggage, the centre of gravity may
either be regarded as <U+FB01>xed, or to vary with the draught of water in
a speci<U+FB01>c manner which may be readily determined.          On the other
hand, many mercantile vessels employed in the carrying trade are
laden with cargoes which, together with the coals that are required
for consumption upon a voyage, weigh twice their own total weight.
 In such cases, the position of the centre of gravity of the laden ship
 is largely dependent upon stowage, and the stability may be entirely
 dependent upon it. The consumption of coal at sea introduces a
 cause of variation in position of centre of gravity, and metacentric
 height, which operates during a voyage; so that the stability may be
 materially altered after a steamer has left port, by reason of the con
 sumption of coal.      Such alteration frequently has the e<U+FB02>fect of
 diminishing the stability: and there are cases of steamers whose
 gross weight when fully laden is reduced at sea from this cause by
 over 25 per cent.,-and, some in which the metacentric height is
 reduced by   115feet.  These large changes in the amount and distri
 bution of a ship’s weights—some. of which take place at sea—
sometimes   make the problem of regulating the stability of    ship, so
                                                                a
as to prevent    its ever becoming de<U+FB01>cient or excessive during her
voyages, a very dif<U+FB01>cult and extremely delicate one.
   The curve of metacentres and the positions of the centre of gravity
for all possible draughts of water and conditions of loading are not
suf<U+FB01>cient, when obtained, for enabling the condition of a ship in
respect of stability to be completely determined. Atwood showed, in
two papers communicated to the Royal Society in 1796 and 1798, that
much more than this is required. In his second paper, read on the 8th
                        “
March, 1798, he says, M. Bouguer, in his treatise entitled Traité du
                                                               ‘
Navire,’ has investigated a theorem for estimating the exact measure
of the stability of <U+FB02>oating bodies.         This theorem, in one sense,   is
general,  not being con<U+FB01>ned    to  bodies  of any particular form; but in
respect to  the angles  of  inclination,
                                       it   is  restrained to the condition
that the inclinations from the upright shall be evanescent, or, in a
practical sense, very small angles.      In consequence of this restriction,
the rule in question cannot be generally applied to ascertain the
stability of ships at sea, because the angles to which they are inclined,
both by rolling and pitching, being of considerable magnitude, the

“214               Prof. F. Elgar.     The Variation   of
stability will depend, not only on the conditions which enter into
M. .Bouguer’s solution, but also on the shape given to the sides of the
vessel above and beneath the water-line         or section, of which M.
Bonguer’s    theorem   takes  no  account.”      It may be added that
Bouguer’s theorem also neglects to      take into  account the volume of
the above-water part of a ship, and to some extent the form of the
below-water part; as well as the absolute height of the centre of
gravity, which has been already referred to.
   Atwood lays down a general theorem for determining the righting
moments, at any required angles of inclination, pessessed by a ship
having a given draught of water and a <U+FB01>xed height of centre of

section of a ship which is inclined to an angle WOW1=0 from the
 upright water-line WL.       Let G be the position of the centre of
 gravity; B the centre of gravity of the volume of the displaced <U+FB02>uid—
 or centre of buoyancy—when upright; and B1 the position to which it
 has been moved by the inclination of the vessel through the angle 0.
 The original form of the under-water volume WAL has now been
 changed by the addition of the wedge-shaped piece LOLl and the
 deduction of the wedge-shaped piece WOWl. The volumes of these
 wedges must be equal, because the displacement has not been changed
 by the mere act of inclination.   Let g1 be the centre of gravity of the
 wedge WOWl, 92 that of LOLI, and v the volume of each wedge.
 Then the horizontal shift, BR, of the centre of buoyancy X the volume

    This  is the formula   by which the stability of a ship at various

 upward pressure of the water act, either to restore the vessel to the
 upright position or to produce further inclination.       The factors 1:,
 V, and hlhg are readily calculated from the external dimensions and
 form of the ship by means of Simpson’s rules; the position of the
 point B, the centre of. buoyancy in the upright position, is similarly
 obtained; and G is either determined by experiment, or by calculating
 in detail the weights and statical moments of the component parts of
 the structure and loading.    Mr. F. K. Barnes, one of the present Chief
  Constructors of the Navy, read a paper before the Institution of
  Naval Architects, in 1860, in which he showed how the requisite
 calculations could be made concisely and with facility.
    Notwithstanding Atwood’s demonstration of the imperfect and
 unreliable standard of stability furnished by mere metacentric height,
 and his theorem for enabling the righting moments at large angles of
 inclination to be determined, the step which it may now appear
 would naturally follow was not actually taken till 1867.        In that
year a question arose at the Admiralty respecting the stability
 of some low freeboard monitors at very large angles of inclination;
and Sir E. J. Reed, then Chief Constructor of the Navy, directed
the matter to be investigated.       It was placed in the hands of Mr.
 William John, who made the calculations, and embodied them in the
graphic form now known as the curve of stability.

   Thus in <U+FB01>g. 9, if OX be an abscissa line, upon which the various
equal divisions represent angles of inclination of a ship, and any
ordinate, such as Pu, be the length of GZ (see <U+FB01>g. 8) at the angle of
inclination a, OPX will be the curve of stability for the particular
draught of water and position of centre of gravity under considera
tion. The results of Mr. John’s calculations were described in a paper
read by Sir E. J. Reed before the Institution of Naval Architects in
1868; and a further paper containing an improved method of
applying Atwood’s theorem to the calculation of stability upon this
extended scale, was read before the same Institution by Messrs. John
and White, in 1871.

216                 Prof.  F. Elgar.    The Variation  of
    The curve of stability, as thus constructed, has been in common
use at the    Admiralty, and in a few of our leading mercantile ship
                                               “ Captain,”
yards    for some years. The loss of H.M.S.                by capsizing at
sea, furnished the impetus which led to the practice of producing
stability information in this complete and instructive form, becoming
established at the Admiralty.        Many losses have occurred of 1a:e
years     in the  mercantile  marine from a similar cause, and forcibly
directed the attention of mercantile naval architects to the same
point. Curves of stability have been constructed for large numbers of
vessels of various classes, many of which have been published; and the
 general character of a ship’s stability can now be judged of with
much greater accuracy than was possible a few years ago.                It
appears that prior to 1867 no calculations had been made which
showed how the stability of a ship became a<U+FB01>ected by inclining her till
the water-line came up over the deck; or at what angle the stability
vanished. Messrs. John and White say in the paper before referred to :
“ The metacentric stability, as it was termed, was by general consent
taken as a sn<U+FB02>iciently good standard of comparison, and n0 approxi
mation was made, nor any great importance attached to the angle of
inclination when a ship ceased to be stable.       It was very generally
known that up to very considerable angles of heel, the stability of
high-sided ships continued to grow, even more rapidly than it
appeared to do from the metacentric method, and the vague impression
that the angle would be very large at which the ship became unstable,
was considered suf<U+FB01>cient to render investigation needless.”
    The investigations conducted at the Admiralty into the stability
of war-ships of low freeboard, and those made by naval architects
outside of the Admiralty into the condition of deeply laden merchant
 steamers of low freeboard and with high centres of gravity of cargo.
 prove that the mere application of the metacentric method may
often lead to a false sense of security being established respecting the
                                             '
stability of certain types of vessels.
    H.M.S. “ Captain ” had a metacentric height of about 2% feet when
laden, which—in the absence of de<U+FB01>nite information, at that time
most unusual and not considered absolutely necessary, respecting the
righting moments at large inclinations, and the angle at which the
 stability vanished—was not supposed to be insu<U+FB02><U+FB01>cient.       Some of our
low freeboard monitors and deeply laden merchant vessels with <U+FB02>ush
decks and low freeboards, have metacentric heights which, by them
selves, furnish no clue to the rapidity with which the stability
 diminishes after a moderate angle of inclination has been passed; or
the smallness of the angle at which it vanishes. The introduction of
curves of stability, and the extent to which they have been applied
in practice, have led to a due and precise appreciation being formed,
by many, of the dangers attendant upon low freeboard.                 The

               Stability with Draught      of  Water in Ships.          217
 opinions  previously    existing upon the point, which were usually
based upon mere surmise        or vague impression, and often in<U+FB02>uenced
by prejudice, can now be corrected by means of exact and conclusive
data. The effect of low freeboard upon stability has latterly been
largely made known and discussed.
   It has been seen that the mere act of setting OK the righting
moments obtained by Atwood’s formula, at various angles of in
clination, as ordinates of a curve, and thus obtaining a complete
graphic representation of the variation of righting moment with
angle of inclination, threw a <U+FB02>ood of light upon the general problem
of a ship’s stability, and enabled it to be far more comprehensively and
accurately treated than before.      It also enabled de<U+FB01>nite and instruc
tive generalisations to     be  made  which were previously impossible.
It will be observed, however, that the curves of stability referred to
only deal with the matter so far as certain <U+FB01>xed draughts of water
and positions of centre of gravity are concerned. A curve of stability
for a given draught of water and position of centre of gravity ceases
to be applicable if changes are made in the weight and consequent
draught of water of a ship, or the position of the centre of gravity, or
both.
   In the case of war-ships, curves of stability are usually constructed
for three conditions. 1st, for the draught of water and position of
centre of gravity of the vessel when fully laden; 2nd, the same, but
with all coal consumed; and, 3rd, when quite light, and without any
coal, ammunition, or consumable stores.         In certain cases there may
be special conditions for which additional curves are required,
but usually the above are all that are considered necessary.            The
stability at intermediate points is not often supposed, or found in
practice, to vary su<U+FB01>iciently to call for furl-her attention. In mercantile
steamers, however, which are often launched in a very light condition
and are constructed for carrying heavy cargoes, and large supplies
Of coal, the question of stability requires a more exhaustive, and
somewhat di<U+FB01>erent, mode of treatment. It becomes necessary, in fact,
to make another step in the same direction as was taken when the
righting moments for various angles of inclination, described by
Atwood, were represented as a whole for a <U+FB01>xed draught of water and
loading by means of a curve of stability.             What is still further
required to complete the representation of a ship’s stability is to show
how the curves of stability themselves vary with draught of water
and position of centre of gravity, and to record this variation in a
form that will render it easy to construct curves of stability for any
speci<U+FB01>c draughts of water and positions of centre of gravity.
   The curves of stability of merchant steamers are required for so
many di<U+FB01>erent draughts of water and positions of centre of gravity,
that   I have found it convenient in practice, after obtaining curves

 218               Prof. F. Elgar.     T/ze Variation  of
for the extreme light and loaded conditions, and one or two inter
mediate ones, to construct cross-curves, from which the ordinates of
a curve of stability at any draught between     the two extreme ones can
be readily measured olf.     In order  to do this, the curve of   stability
already described has to be analysed, and dealt with under a different
form. The ordinary curve of stability, as illustrated in <U+FB01>g. 9, is a curve
showing the variation in the length of GZ in <U+FB01>g. 8—01‘ the arm of
the inclining couple—with the angle of inclination.         Pa in <U+FB01>g. 9 is
the length of GZ in <U+FB01>g. 8, at the angle of inclination 1.              But
 GZ=BR—BT=BR—BG sin 0.                Therefore Pa in <U+FB01>g. 9 is the
difference of these two quantities at the angle of inclination a.      The
curve of stability, or curve of GZ, is a curve whose ordinates are
equal to the differences between the corresponding ordinates of two
curves, one of which represents the variation in the length of BR
with change of inclination, and the other is a curve of sines with
                                  FIG. 10.
radius BG. Thus if Opb, <U+FB01>g. 10, be a curve, of which the ordinates,
such as 130:, are equal to the length of BB at the angle of inclina
tion a; and Opla, a curve of sines from 0° to 90° with radius
ac=BG; then the di<U+FB01>'erences between the ordinates of these curves
will give the corresponding values of GZ, or the ordinates of the
curve of stability.    Thus 10101 is the length of GZ at the angle of
inclination a, and is equal to the ordinate Pan of the curve given in
<U+FB01>g. 9.
   It will be obvious that after calculating  three or four curves of BB
for a vessel, including those for the two extremes of draught, no
further calculation is necessary for obtaining a similar curve at any
intermediate draught, since it is only requisite to construct cross
curves at given angles of inclination—say           at intervals of 10°—
and from these cross-curves to measure off the ordinates of the
curve BR for the draught required. Having thus obtained the curve
of BB for the draught in question, the ordinary curve of stability,

                   Stability with Draught of Water in Ships.                         219
 0r lengths of GZ, can be obtained by setting o<U+FB01> a curve of sines as
  in <U+FB01>g. 10 to radius BG, and deducting the ordinates of this curve
 from the corresponding ones of the curve of BB. This mode of con
 structing curves of stability has been rendered necessary by the great
 variations in draught of water and position of centre of gravity that
 have to be dealt with in many mercantile steamers.                     The demand
 that has thus arisen for constructing cross-curves of stability,
 i.e., curves showing the variation of righting moment with draught
 of water at constant angles of inclination, has recently led to greatly
 improved and more rapid methods of calculation                       being devised.
 Amsler’s mechanical integrator has been invaluable in bringing about
 this desirable result, and it is now possible to make a complete set
 of cross-curves of stability for a ship in a few days.‘
     In considering the stability of a ship from the point of view of
 variation of righting moment with draught of water, the angle of
 inclination being constant, instead of from that of variation of
 righting moment with angle of inclination, the draught being
 constant, as was formerly done; or, rather, in considering the
 subject from both points of view instead of almost exclusively from
 the latter, several interesting and important results are obtained,
 which do not appear to have received the attention they deserve.
     It has already been stated that one of the <U+FB01>rst lessons taught by
 the introduction of curves of stability was the decrease in the righting
 moments at large angles of inclination, and the rapidity with which
 stability frequently vanishes altogether, in vessels of low freeboard.
 These are matters of great practical importance, and have attracted a
 great deal of attention, on account of the numerous vessels of various
 types which are more or less affected by them. The connexion be
 tween low freeboard and range of stability, and the manner in which
 the latter is affected by metacentric height and the position of the
 centre of gravity, has latterly been well discussed and explained;
    * The method thus described of calculating a series of ordinary curves of
stability and afterwards constructing cross-curves from them is tedious and compli
cated.    It is simpler and very much more expeditious to calculate the cross-curves
directly by applying the integrator to the under-water part of the ship, instead of to
the wedges of immersion and emersion ; and thus determining at once the positions of
the vertical lines through the centres of buoyancy at the required angles of inclina
tion. By this means the necessity is avoided of calculating separately the volumes
of the wedges of immersion and emersion, and of correcting the positions <U+FB01>rst assumed
for the inclined water-lines in order to make these wedges approximately equal.
Mr. William Denny, of Dumbarton, was the <U+FB01>rst to call my attention to this very
important and useful simpli<U+FB01>cation ; and it was described by him in a paper read
before the Institution of Naval Architects in April last.    Other investigators have
also been working in the same direction, and several papers dealing with the exten

220                  Prof.  F. Elgar.      The Variation     of
and the dangers which may be incurred by low-sided ships are well
understood by many. In former times, it was not so necessary as it
has recently become, to carry theoretical investigations to the point
of ascertaining the angle at which a ship would capsize.              It is only
during   the  last   twenty years    that   small  height   of side out of water
has been thought adesirable quality         for sea-going war-ships to possess,
or that certain classes of merchant vessels have been evolved in which
range of stability has been unduly limited by lowness of freeboard.
When Atwood wrote his papers, and for very many years after, war
ships were built with such lofty sides, and merchant vessels were so
comparatively uniform in type, and so deep in proportion to their other
dimensions, that no demand arose for complete curves of stability.
Besides, all the vessels of Atwood’s day, and for long after, were
sailing ships; and such few investigations as were made respecting
their stability, were for the purpose of determining their sail-carrying
power. The constructors of the old types of vessels judged of and
regulated stability by reference to the practical test of sail-carrying
power at sea, and this was usually suf<U+FB01>cient for the purpose.
Modern variations of type, which began after the introduction of
steam, have for some time, however, rendered scienti<U+FB01>c calculations
necessary,    which before were considered merely interesting or
curious.    The many departures from the comparative uniformity
of proportions and form that once prevailed, and particularly the
extent to which some of these departures have gone in the direction
of reducing freeboard, have created the necessity referred to.
   Curves of stability, having been <U+FB01>rst produced for the purpose of
ascertaining the e<U+FB01>ect of low freeboard, and having disclosed the
dangers which lowness of freeboard may cause, have been largely
used for that purpose.       If we consider the cross-curves of stability—
or curves    of  righting    moments     for various draughts of water, the
angle of inclination being constant—it will be seen that while the
upper and middle portions of these curves have been often dealt
with, the lower portions have been almost, if not quite, neglected.
The stability of a <U+FB02>oating body at light draughts is, however, similar
in character to that at deep draughts, and the same peculiar features
and dangers that have been found to exist with low freeboard are
frequently connected also with lightness of draught.
   It fell to my lot to make some investigations respecting the
stability possessed by the “Daphne” at the time of the disaster
 which befell her, and to give evidence respecting the same.             I after
wards, by way      of  explanation    of  a  portion  of  the  evidence, wrote a
letter to the “Times,” which appeared on the 1st September last,
calling attention to the relation which exists between the righting
moments at deep        and light droughts in certain elementary forms of
                                         I
                   ‘
<U+FB02>oating   bodies.     The  proposition      then enunciated, which illustrates

                  Stability with Draught of Water in Ships.               221
the point under consideration, is the following:              If any homo
geneous body,       which  is symmetrical    about  the three principal axes
at its centre of gravity, be of such density as to <U+FB02>oat with its lowest
point at a depth :0 below the water; then, if the density be altered
so as to make it <U+FB02>oat with its highest point at a height a: above the
water, the righting moments will be the same in both cases at equal
angles of inclination, and consequently the range of stability and
complete curve of righting moments will be the same.                This pro
position can be made still more general, as was shown by Mr. William
John, in a letter to the “ Times ” of the 5th September; as it applies
to all homogeneous <U+FB02>oating bodies of irregular form revolving
about a horizontal axis <U+FB01>xed only in direction.              In this general
form, the condition of turning the body through an angle of 180°, or
upside down, must, however, be included, because the immersed
volume in the one case must be of the same form as the emersed
volume in the other, and this can only be obtained with irregularly
shaped <U+FB01>gures by turning them through an angle of 180°. For this
reason    I   chose symmetrical <U+FB01>gures for the purpose of giving a
popular     illustration  of the analogous effects of low freeboard and
light draught upon the stability of ships, and avoided introducing
the condition of turning through 180° in order to get similar volumes
above and below water in each case.              The general proof of the
proposition     laid down   is that the line joining the centre of gravity of
the immersed volume with that of the volume above water must pass
through the centre of gravity of the whole body, and the distances
of the centres of gravity of the two sections from that of the whole
body are inversely proportional to their volumes ; so that the moment
of stability, which is proportional to the immersed volume multiplied
by the distance of its centre of gravity from that of the whole body,
will be the same in both cases.
   As the righting moments at equal angles of inclination at the deep
and light draughts described are the same in a homogeneous <U+FB02>oating
body of symmetrical form, it follows that at the same draughts the
lengths of GZ, or the arms of the righting lever at equal angles of
 inclination, and also the metacentric heights, are in the inverse ratio
 of the displaced volumes.
    The moment of stability Vx GZ is by Atwood’s formula, see <U+FB01>g. 8,
 equal to 'v x hlhz—V ><BG sin 0. Now '0 X hlhz, which is the moment
 of the wedges of immersion and emersion, is the same whether
 WAL be the below-water or above-water volume; the immersed
 wedge in the one case being the emersed in the other, and vice versli.
VXBR is therefore the same in <U+FB02>oating bodies of any form that
 revolve about a horizontal axis <U+FB01>xed in direction, whether WAL be
 the above-water or below-water volume.             For such bodies as are
 homogeneous Vx BG sin 0 is also equal in the two cases, because

  222                Prof. F. Elgar.        The Variation  of
  BG is inversely proportional to V, or          the immersed  volume; from
 whence we again derive the         result that the moments of stability at
  equal angles of inclination are the same. In the case of a body which
 is not homogeneous,        and in which the centre of gravity is at a
  distance GGl from G, the centre of gravity of a similar homogeneous
 body, the moments of stability at equal angles of inclination when
  WAL represents above-water and below-water volumes respectively,
  differ from each other by an amount equal to (V1+V2)GG1 sin 0,
 where V1 and V2 are the two volumes into which the whole body is
  divided by the water-line plane WL.          When the change of immersed
 volume is produced by merely increasing the depth of immersion, as
  in a ship—and not by rotating the body so as to make WAL repre
  sent above-water and below-water volumes alternately—the difference
 between the moments of stability is (VI—V2) GG, sin 6.           In the <U+FB01>rst
 case it is G'rG1 sinOX the whole volume of the body: and in the
 second it is GG1 sin 0X the di<U+FB01>erence between the volumes into which
 the body is divided by the water-line plane WL.
     Some of the results which follow from the above considerations
 have been previously noticed. Atwood, in his paper read before the
 Royal Society in 1796, discusses at great length the positions of
 equilibrium of homogeneous rectangular bodies, and prisms of square
 sections, with varying speci<U+FB01>c gravities.        He shows that whether the
 speci<U+FB01>c gravity of a square parallelopiped be a or l—a, it will
 <U+FB02>oat in equilibrium with its faces at the same angles to the water
 surface, and will pass through the same number of positions of equi
 librium in turning through 360°.            These cases are included in the
 general    proposition   that  the  righting   moments at equal angles of
inclination    are the same for both densities of the body, because the
 righting moments will vanish, 'i.e., positions of equilibrium will occur,
 at equal angles of inclination.        Atwood also shows, in a paper read
 before the Royal Society in 1798, that the stability of a vessel
 whose sides are inclined at a given angle below the water-surface,
 is equal to that of a vessel whose sides are inclined to similar
 angles above the water-surface; the breadth of the water-line and
 other conditions being the same in both cases.           He goes on to say
 that this proposition is not con<U+FB01>ned to the case which he demon
 strates, but is equally true whatever <U+FB01>gure be given to the sides of the
 ship, and whether they are plain or curved, provided that the sides
 under the water in one vessel are similar and equal, and similarly
 disposed in respect of the water-line, to the sides of the other vessel
 above the water-line.        The unnecessary condition, so far as homo
 geneous     bodies   are   concerned,    introduced by Atwood, that the
 displacements shall be equal, prevented him from pushing his conclu
  sions to the extent to which they have been carried in this paper.
     It should here be remarked that in dealing with cross-curves of

                                                                  '
               Stability ivith Draught of Water in Ships.           223
stability, and thus considering the variation of stability with draught
of water, the curves of righting moments require to be constructed,
and not merely curves of GZ, or lengths of righting arm.            The
ordinary curve of stability usually has for its ordinates the lengths
of GZ at the various angles of inclination.    This is right enough for
the condition under which such curves are constructed ; because the
displacement is then constant, and the curves represent either
lengths of righting arm or righting moments, according to the scale
upon which the ordinates are measured.          In the cross-curves of
stability, however, draught is one of the variable elements, and the
displacement changes with it. A cross-curve whose ordinates repre
sent the lengths of righting arm at various draughts of water is
therefore quite different in character from a cross-curve of righting
moments, whose ordinates are lengths of righting arm ><displacement.
It is necessary, in order to judge accurately of the variation of
stability with draught of water, to use curves of righting moments,
and not merely curves of GZ, such as are usually considered suf<U+FB01>cient
when the draught of water is <U+FB01>xed.

are upright, and is two-thirds of the longer axis, or extreme breadth.
The measurements in the direction of OY give the depths of immer
sion, and those in the direction of OX represent moments. The curve
APO gives the values, for the rectangular body when inclined to an
angle of 30° from the upright, of the horizontal shift of the centre
of buoyancy multiplied by the immersed volume, or BR X V, see <U+FB01>g. 8.
Thus if 00. be any draught of water, the ordinate am gives the value
of BRXV at that draught. The curve AQO is the corresponding
curve of moments for a prismatic body of elliptical section, and of equal
length to the above, when inclined also to an angle of 30°.        The axes
of the ellipse are of the same length as the sides of the rectangular
section taken in the former case; the minor axis being two-thirds of
the major, and the minor axis being vertical when the body is upright.
Ape and Age are the corresponding curves of GZ x V at the various
draughts of water, and are obtained by deducting VX BG sin 30°
from the ordinates of the curves APO and AQO.                   The bodies
being homogeneous,      G  is taken  at the  middle   of the depth.  These
curves therefore'represent the actual righting moments of the two
bodies under consideration, for an inclination of 30°, at all draughts
of water. The ordinates measured to the right of AO giving righting
moments, and those to the left, if there were any, would be upsetting
moments. It will be seen that the whole of the curves in <U+FB01>g. 11 are
symmetrical with respect to a line drawn parallel to OX at one half
the depth of total immersion.       The elliptical prism tends to return to
the upright, when at the inclination of 30°, at all draughts of water ;
and exerts the maximum e<U+FB01>ort to do so when immersed to the
middle of its depth.      The rectangular prism, when inclined to the
same angle, also tends to return to the upright at all depths of
immersion; the maximum righting moment is not, however, obtained
 when <U+FB02>oating at the middle of its depth, but at draughts which are
at equal distances above and below it.
   Fig. 12 represents similar curves for a prismatic body, the upper half
of whose section is rectangular, and the lower half elliptical as shown
in <U+FB01>g. 6; the extreme dimensions of the section being the same as in
the previous cases. This form of section is an example of the kind of
departure from symmetry of form which exists in ships. It has been
seen that if homogeneous       bodies of symmetrical form be altered in
density  so   as to  <U+FB02>oat alternately  at water-lines which are at equal
distances   above   and  below   the centres  of such bodies, the righting
 moments at equal angles of inclination will be the same at each
draught.     In the body for which the curves in <U+FB01>g. 12 have been con
structed, the departure from similarity of the immersed and out of
water volumes causes a difference between the righting moments at
the draughts described. APIO and APBO represent the curves of

BR X V at   angles of inclination of 30° and 60° respectively ; and A1910,
A1020 are the  corresponding curves of GZXV, or curves of righting
moments, when G is taken in the position it would occupy if the body
were homogeneous.       The lines alml and 0.2002 indicate draughts at

   It will be seen that the righting moments are greater at 30° and
60° of inclination when the body is deeply immersed than when it is
<U+FB02>oating at light draughts with equal volumes below water to those
which are above in the other case. The relation between the righting
moments at the two extremes of draught is, however, largely deter
mined in a. ship by the position of the centre of gravity, which in
this case has been taken as for a. homogeneous body. This will be
seen by the next example.

for all draughts of water—it always varies, and in some cases con
siderably, with the draught, as has been stated, but 19 feet       found       is

that the righting moments which correspond with the ordinates of
the usual curves of stability are much larger at deep draughts
than at light draughts.      For instance, the ordinates of the usual

     The centre of gravity taken in <U+FB01>g. 141 is 1'1 feet below where it
 would be if the external surface of the ship inclosed a homogeneous
 volume. Its position with reference to that of the centre of gravity
 of a homogeneous body of the same form largely determines the
 stability at all except small angles of inclination, and also the
 relation between the stability at light and deep draughts.        Figs. 15
and 16 show what <U+FB01>g. 14 becomes changed into, if the centre of
gravity is <U+FB01>rst raised 1'1 feet, so as to be in the same position as if
 the ship were a homogeneous body, and, second, if it is raised a further
 1'1 feet, so as to be as much above this point in <U+FB01>g. 16 as it is below
it in <U+FB01>g. 14. A comparison of these <U+FB01>gures will show that, except in
the case of a very high centre of gravity, the stability at light
draughts with various positions of centre of gravity is less than at
deep draughts.
    It appears,  therefore, that in the case of this ship, and she is a
type of many mercantile passenger steamers, the proposition respect
ing the equality of the stability at light and deep draughts which
has been shown to apply to homogeneous symmetrical bodies, requires
                                                    .

   The analogy that exists between light draught and deep draught
stability in <U+FB02>oating bodies of approximately symmetrical forms, and
particularly the point of resemblance a<U+FB01>orded by the fact that what
is a wedge of immersion in one case is'that of emersion in the other,
and vice verso), cannot fail to have struck some who have had to
calculate the stability of bodies <U+FB02>oating at light draughts, but atten
tion has never been prominently called to it. It is desirable, how
ever, that the connexion between the two cases should be fully
realised, and the dangers peculiar to very light draught of water
appreciated as thoroughly as are those which attach to low freeboard.
Just as was said in 1871, in a passage already quoted, that meta
centric height was formerly, by general consent, taken as a su<U+FB01>iciently
good standard of comparison in judging of the stability a ship would
have, on account of “the vague impression that the angle would be
very large at which the ship became unstable,” so, since the intro
duction of curves of stability, the dangers attaching to light draught
have been frequently lost sight of, because of the equally vague impres
sion that, so long as a vessel has a high side out of water, and any

     Vam'eties and Morphology          of  the  Human Lachrymal Bone.            229
metacentric height, she will have large righting moments at great
inclinations       and a large range of stability.              The investigations
made at the time of the “Daphne” disaster, and the discussions
which these and the elaborate report of the Government Commis
sioner, Sir E. J. Reed, have caused, now place this question upon a
somewhat different footing; but at the time referred to the general
belief appears to have been as stated.
    The considerations set forth in this paper are mainly intended to
draw attention to the necessity for taking a. more comprehensive view
of the problem of stability than has formerly prevailed, by investi
gating the cross-curves of stability of ships, and thus ascertaining
how the righting moments at <U+FB01>xed angles of inclination vary with
 draught of water. They also aim at showing how the stability at
<U+FB01>xed inclinations does vary in some ships with draught of water, and
 becomes comparatively small at light draughts.                 In designing ships
and other structures which are required to <U+FB02>oat safely at very light
 draughts of water, such calculations are necessary if accidents are to
 be prevented.        In some cases the necessity is as great, or even
greater,vthan for vessels of low freeboard.
    The subject is so extensive that         I feel quite unable to attempt any
 exhaustive treatment of         it  at the present time. All that has now
 been possible is to call attention to some of its main features.
and to show why it requires to be followed up and thoroughly
investigated.

         of Cambridge. Received March 14, 1884. Read March 27.

    Having examined 10001achrymalboues and the soft parts of the
lachrymal region of over 300 orbits,            I  have compiled therefrom the
following notes on the anatomy of these parts. The lachrymal is one
of the most variable bones in the human skull, and one of the most
perishable, being frequently destroyed by careless                      or ignorant
methods of handling crania.
         I
    I. have notes of two* instances of de<U+FB01>ciency of the lachrymal
bone. In one of these cases the whole wall of the groove is formed
by the nasal process of the maxilla in front, and by the ethmoid and
   ’1‘ I  have since seen eight additional instances of absence, in the Hunterian and
other collections, <U+FB01>ve being in Hindoo crania, two in Negroes, in none of which
 was there any trace of synostosis.

frontal behind;        a small lacuna     closed by membrane completing the
boundary.         In the second instance the right groove is entirely
formed by the maxilla, the nasal process of which is expanded
backwards (<U+FB01>g. 20, w) into a <U+FB02>at plate behind the crista lachrymalis
posterior (y), which also is maxillary.              This plate articulates above
with the frontal, and posteriorly with the prolonged orbital plate of
the maxilla, which meets the frontal in a suture between the back of
the nasal lamella and the front of the os planum.                   On the left side
the lobe of the nasal process articulates by suture with the ethmoid,
and below it there is a small lacuna (<U+FB01>g. 28, lam), which may possibly
have been <U+FB01>lled by an ossicle. In this skull all the sutures are
distinct, so the variety is not due to synostosis.
    Systematic writers speak inde<U+FB01>nitely of such cases, and Krause
(“ Handbuch,” III, p. 71) says that it occurs in 8 per cent. of crania,
but does not specify from what number of crania his percentage is
derived.         This is not my experience, and         I believe it is not safe to
make museum crania.“ the basis of such observations, as                  I have more
than once seen instances of rndimental lachrymal bones in which the
diminutive bone fell out in the course of handling.                     Metzger also
 records cases of absence (“ Curat. Chirurg. Fistulae Lachrymalis, Hist.
Critica,” Miinster, 1772, p. 66).
    II. Rudimental states of the bone are very common, and think it          I
 probable that many of the so-called instances of de<U+FB01>ciency are really
 examples of some one or other of these conditions.                  I have notes of
 <U+FB01>ve forms of rudimental bone.
    a. Development of an orbital plate alone, terminating at the crista
 lachrymalis, and with consequent exclusion from the lachrymal
 groove which is formed of the nasal process of the maxilla alone.
         I
 This have thrice seen, all in unsymmetrical examples; the bones in
  each case were simple scales of small size, corresponding                       to the
  hinder portion of the orbital plate of the normal bone, in one case
  resembling the superior ethmo-lachrymal ossicle to be after de
 scribed.
     In several crania in which the lachrymal bone had been broken or
  had fallen away,      I have seen the largely developed lachrymal lamella
  of the nasal process of the maxilla which, in the perfect cases, was
  associated with this variety, and hence probably they were instances
  of the same condition. A similar arrangement is described by Henle
  (“ Knochenlehre,” p. 193) as occurring in an Italian skull.
     B. Development of two detached ossicles in place of a normal bone.
  This    I   have once found in a Negro skull.             The lower of the two
 ossicles was the larger, and formed a small part of the lachrymal
    * Another reason why museum crania form an unsafe basis for
                                                                         statistics is the
  obvious    one that they are to a large extent selected on account of their exhibiting
  peculiarities.

lachrymal bone; they are separated by               membranous interval.

 Possibly this should be classed with the cases, to be after mentioned,
of superior ethmo-lachrymal ossicles, but the upper bone took the
place of the upper fourth of the crista lachrymalis, and so differed
from all the instances of ossicle with which       have met.
                                                     I
    In one other instance of divided lachrymal the two parts were
 separated, not by a membranous space, but by a projecting ridge of
the os planum which traversed the lachrymal and touched the
 frontal.     This was an instance of the overgrowth of the wall of
 the partition between the upper and lower lachrymo-ethmoidal cells
jutting through the surface scale of lachrymal.          Professor Gruber
has described     a  somewhat similar case (“Muller’s Archiv,” 1848,
p. 412, T. xiv).     In a South American skull         have seen a similar

these    the bone was  not  more  than  2'5 millims. broad, and lay along
the front of the ethmoid.          In the other the strip was closely
perforated with holes, another embryonic character; in neither was
there any hamulus laohrymalis.

most of such cases are old bones, and the holes are due to absorption
consequent on dilatation of the ethmo-lachrymal cells, but in some of
those examined the same condition occurred in young crania, and in
most of the recent orbits in which such de<U+FB01>ciencies were noticed the
bone had  a    continuous sub-periosteal membrane over these holes.
Ten of these bones were reduced to a few trabeculw which were the
remains of those parts of the normal bone which are thickest and
densest, viz., the crista and the rods between the upper and lower
lachrymo-ethmoidal cells, and a bar along both the superior and the
inferior margins.

 bars which represented the bone were thus the rods representing
 the cell boundaries.
    III. Variations in outline. No two lachrymal bones are exactly
 alike, and all intermediate forms between the broadly ovate and the
 narrow rectangular have been found. The patterns of the borders
 also are the subjects of great variety, from perfect straightness to the
 most irregular lobulation.    The anterior edge is always the longest,
 the superior is the shortest, the inferior is usually the least toothed
 and the most uniform in outline.
    The upper or frontal edge presents three types; it is nearly
 horizontal in 31 per cent., it rises obliquely from behind forwards to
 the maxilla in 21 per cent., but in the majority, 43 per cent., it formed
an angle salient upwards and forwards, as the upper edge of the orbital
portion rises obliquely to the top of the crista, and thence the upper
edge of the grooved portion descends rather steeply to the maxilla.
In only one bone did the entire border slope downwards and forwards.
    This border is approximately. on the level of the top of the
0s planum in 48 per cent., rises above it in 39 per cent., but lay
below it in 13 per cent., the edge is usually denticulated, especially at
the top of the crest, and from this forward where it is thicker than it
is behind. Ankylosis of this border is not uncommon, to some
extent it occurred in one out of every thirty examined, especially in
front of the crista.
    A spur of the frontal descended between the lachrymal and the
os planum in 341 per cent., but this was only large in one-third of
these.    A similar frontal spur projects into the maxillo-lachrymal
suture in two-ninths of those examined, but Was usually slight, only
strongly marked in one-fourteenth of these cases of its occurrence.
 The best marked example of the post-lachrymal spur projected down
wards for 5 millims., and of the pre-lachrymal for 4'5 millims.
    The upper edge is below the level of the maxillo-frontal suture in
all, and this suture usually rises obliquely in front of it, but in some
 (percentage not recorded) it rises suddenly and steeply.
    The ethmo-lachrymal suture is concave backwards in 50 per cent.
 straight in 12 per cent., irregular in 36 per cent., convex backwards
 in 2 per cent., it is more or less toothed in 25 per cent., and seldom
 ankyloses to the ethmoid (135 per cent.) The posterior superior
 angle is usually rounded and seldom projects as far backward as the
 posterior inferior; in one it sent a process backwards above the
ethmoid for 2 millims., a similar condition of the posterior inferior
angle undershooting the ethmoid occurred to a marked extent in
2 per cent., and to a slight extent in 14 per cent.    A slight maxillary
 spur projects between the ethmoid and 0s planum in 141 per cent., but
 is only sharp and strong in 3 per cent. -The anterior edge is usually
irregular and convex forWards, seldom straight          13,-per cent.) or

    siderable size (<U+FB01>g. 33). These foramina can be seen, even before
    ankylosis, in rather more than 10 per cent. of the specimens
    examined.     One large hole exists at the anterior superior angle in
    20 per cent. of the cases examined (<U+FB01>g. 25).      The lower end of the
    anterior margin extends downwards into the canal below the level of

     amount of lobulation, and      it sometimes deeply indented by bays,
                                         is
      sometimes one or two of these extend almost to the crista lachrymalis;

                    it   a  spur backwards into the ethmoid; this      have
                                                                          I
     seen in three instances. In another instance a long process of the
      os planum of the ethmoid projected forwards below the lachrymal
    bone and below the inferior lachrymo-ethmoidal ossicle, separating
    these from the maxilla as far as the crista lachrymalis.
       IV. The varieties of crista lachrymalis and of hamulus are very
    numerous, but may be reduced to four types——
       A. Simple lamellar forms with obsolete crest.
       B. Simple carinate forms.
       C. Carino-acuminate forms.

234        Prof. A. Macalister.       Notes on the Varieties and
    D. Carine-hamate forms.
    A. In the normal lachrymal the two lamellae, orbital and lachrymal,
which unite at the crista, form an angle which is not far from a right
angle, but in those of this <U+FB01>rst variety the two parts are so nearly
on the same plane that the crest is obsolete.         This condition is rare,
I  found it only in twelve bones, mostly of old persons.         There is no
prolongation   of the  bone  into   the nasal  canal,  and the lower  edge of
the bone ends opposite the con<U+FB02>uence of the nasal duct and lachrymal
sac, that is, opposite the lower valve of Béraud (“Gaz. Médicale,”
1851). Coexisting with this       I  have never found any separate ossicle
nor any imperfect suture,    and    <U+FB01>ve of them at least were fenestrated
with absorption holes.
    B. The second or simply carinate forms are commoner, and vary in
detail of development from those in which the orbital face of the bone
shows a slightly ridged convexity below to those in whom the surface
is marked by a strongly projecting ridge at the con<U+FB02>uence of the
grooved and the posterior lamella.          In ten out of thirty-six such
bones the crest was continuous from above downwards, in twelve it
was rounded for the upper third, in nine for the upper half, while in
<U+FB01>ve it was quite obsolete above.       Of those in which it was continuous
three had a well-marked spur of the crest in the upper part of its
middle third, the surface behind which         I have found giving attach
ment to the upper ascending <U+FB01>bres of the musculus lachrymalis
posterior of Henke (“Archiv fiir Ophthalmologie,” iv, 270).          In none
of these was the crest prolonged into a point below, but it ended by
its lower border coming into contact with the crista. lachrymalis
of the maxilla.    This form seldom coexists with anomalous suturation,
was not uncommonly fenestrated or foraminated, sometimes ankylosed,
and the edges when free were generally uneven.
    G. The third form is the commonest among European skulls.                I
have found it in over 50 per cent. of British lachrymals, and in 42 per
cent. of all examined.      In most of these bones the crest becomes
gradually   more  acutely  elevated    as it descends, and ends in a sharp
point which overlies the edge of the maxilla.         The lower edge of the
bone close to the hamulus splits into two lamellae, an outer which
becomes continuously articulated with the orbital <U+FB02>oor of the maxilla,
an inner continuous downwards into the processus turbinalis, and for
ward into the processus l-achrymalis, the latter of which usually comes
in contact with the upper and outer edge of the processus hamatus
minor, and the anterior edge of the nnciform process of the ethmoid.
The surface between these lies on the maxilla, but is sometime, by
the absorption of the intervening lamella of bone, brought in contact
with the mucous lining of the opening of the antrmn maxilla're.
    In rather more than 12 per cent. the apex of the crest where it
touches the maxilla points directly to the inner end of the suture

             Mogulzology   of the Human Lachrymal Bone,               235
infraorb'italis transversa, and not uncommonly a sutu'ra verticalis passes
downwards and forwards therefrom, either to the infra-orbital or the
                                                            '
accessory infra-orbital canal.
   The crest in a few instances projects as a sharp thin lamella, and
this has its free border either uniform or prolonged into spinous points.
The commonest place for such prolongation is at the junction of the
upper and middle third, a second often exists at the lower third, and
these two may coexist. These spines are still more frequent in the
bones showing the next variety.
   D. The carino-hamate form is nearly as common as the last, and in
the series of American crania in the Cambridge Museum it is found
in three out of each <U+FB01>ve. Among European crania I have found it
only in 27 per cent., and in 39 per cent. of the entire number exa
mined.     These vary from forms with a small acuminate spur—that is,
strongly pronounced cases of the last form—to those with a large
quadrate process projecting over the orbital ridge to the face; this
last condition occurred in 315 of all the European crania examined, but
in % of all crania. This is the form which is most commonly asso
ciated with accessory ossicles and sutures. In these cases, as well as
in the last series, the crista lachrymalis frequently begins above as
a rounded tuberous knob below the frontal suture, sometimes as a
sharp ridge, and this may be curved forward so as to arch sharply
over the lachrymal sac. This occurs in 2 per cent. In old bones this
region is usually thinned and rounded, owing to the distension of the
upper lachrymo-ethmoidal        cell. Below this the crest at its upper
third is often prolonged into a spine for the attachment of the
 Zach'rymal'is posterior (attached not to the sharp edge, but to the
posterior and outer surface of the spine), below which the crest is
less prominent and is indented into a bay, generally again becom
ing prominent and merging into the hamulus. This arrangement of
the crest exists in one-sixth of the bones examined.
   In 2per cent. of hamate bones the border of the crista is reduced to
a thread 1 millim. in breadth; but     I have not found this form to be
constant among negroes, as Sdmmering regarded it to be (Weber
Hildebrand,    II, 401).
   In  three cases   I  found examples of the second spine above the
hamulus at the lower third of the crista, similar to that described by
Schwegel (“ Henle u. Pfeufer’s Zeitschrift,”        III Reihe, V, 1856,
p. 866).
   In   <U+FB01>ve cases there was a perforation through the root of the
hamulus, traversed in one instance by a branch of the infra-orbital
artery.    The hamulus is pierced by one or two holes in 2 per cent. of
specimens, and these transmit similar vessels.
   In one Malay skull the hamulus was wide and deep, reminding one
of the condition in many catarrhine monkeys.

  236        Prof. A. Macalister.    [Votes on the Varieties    and
    Of other points of super<U+FB01>cial anatomy in connexion with this bone ,
 the following may be noticed. While, in general, the orbital sur
 face is uniform,   I  have several times found it to be irregular, pro
 bably as the result of accident.        Usually this takes the form of
 irregular surface depressions. It may also present vascular grooves
 for branches of the infra-orbital artery, but these are not common.
    The inner surface below presents two lamellar processes :—
    1. Processus lachrymalis, the very variable concave lamella which
 projects into the nasal canal; usually this ends below in a rounded
 border, but in a few it ends in an acute down-directed point. The
 length of this rarely exceeds 3 millims.; the maximum which          I have
 found is 6 millims.
    2. The processus turbinalis, or the inferior internal margin, is by
 far the most irregular portion of the bone; it touches the inner side
 of the maxilla in front of the opening of the antrum, and generally is
 prolonged downwards to a point where it converges with the pro
 oessus lachrymalis.
    The lower margin of this articulates with the processus lachrymalis
of the maxillo-turbinal in about 66 per cent. of cases.        The forms of
this articulation are variable ; but in 70 per cent. the outer surface of
the turbinal overlaps a small space of the inside of the process of the
lachrymal.
    The outline of this processus turbinalis is rudely triangular in
about 70 per cent. with three sharp margins; in some there are four
edges, an additional one being placed between the lachrymal process
and the point of the turbinal process.
    V. In size and degree of development there is little difference between
the bones of the two sexes; the average male lachrymal has a maxi
mum length in the orbit of 165 millims. (not counting the downward
extension of the processus lachrymlis), the average female has a length
of 155 millims. The shortest normal adult bone measured 8 millims.,
the longest 19'5. The breadth at the lowest border was more variable,
the average being 9'5, the extremes 4 and 14. The lachrymal index
b x 100
          averaged 60, but many varied between 42 and 75, the average
     1
female index being a little higher than the male.         The width of the
upper edge is the most variable, the widest of 70 measurements was
11 millims., the narrowest 2, the average 7'75.
    The hamulus is commoner in male than in female skulls.
    VI. The   vascular relations of the lachrymal bone are usually very
de<U+FB01>nite, a branch of the infra-orbital passes under, through, or over
the hamulus into the lachrymal canal; branches of the infra-orbital
and of the angular artery pierce the suture between the maxilla and
lachrymal anteriorly and a branch of the nasal division of the ophthal
mic artery passes through the suture at the fronto-maxillary angle

                                                                                     n

     into the superior lachrymo-ethmoidal cell. In 20 per cent. there is
                                                                        I
     a distinct aperture, sometimes of large size for this, and have found
    in many cases a very <U+FB01>ne twig of the infra-trochlear nerve to accom
    pany the artery through this foramen, making thus, with the
    nervulus spheno-ethmoidalis of Luschka and the proper nasal, a third
    ethmoidal branch from the ophthalmic division of the <U+FB01>fth.
       VII. The disposition of the periosteum ou the outer surface of the
     lachrymal bone is worthy of note.               Tracing it forward from the
    os planum on the orbital surface, it is without much dif<U+FB01>culty
    divisible into two layers, and at the crista lachrymal'is the innermost
    of these again divides into two lamellae—one, which keeps close to the
    surface of the bone, lining the lachrymal groove, and is traceable
   forwards on the nasal process of the maxilla to the level of the
    lachrymal crest on that bone.          This layer is separable from the outer
   wall of the lachrymal sac, to which it is attached by a loose connective
   tissue, in which many vessels ramify.* The 'outer layer of this
   inner lamella unites with the entire of the outer lamella and passes
   over the lachrymal sac as a lachrymal aponeurosis continuing for
   wards and inwards to unite with the former layer at the crista lachry
   malis anterior. These layers underlie the muscul'i lachrymales, and
   are pierced by the canalto'uli, along which, towards the puncta, they
   send an expansion, and beneath the inferior of which the deeper layer
   is strengthened by a more or less strong <U+FB01>brous band, which starts
   from the lower edge of the crista lachrymalis and passes obliquely
   forwards to be attached to the outer and lower part of the crest of
   the same name on the maxilla.                This is the band which, when
   ossi<U+FB01>ed, becomes the hamulus lachrymali's, and which seems to be
   constantly present, either in this primitive membranous condition or
   else as a longer or shorter ossi<U+FB01>cation in this membrane; the presence
  or absence of the hamulus is thus in reality the ossi<U+FB01>cation or non
  ossi<U+FB01>cation of a constant though variable band. Beneath this band
  the small lachrymal branch of the infra-orbital artery passes to the
  nasal duct, and where it arches over this vessel, the membranous or
  bony hamulus not uncommonly gives attachment to <U+FB01>bres of the
  inferior oblique muscle, for the rest of which there is usually a
  distinct depression on the maxilla.
       The outer connexions of the periosteal <U+FB01>brous layer which lies
  super<U+FB01>cial to the lachrymal sac are not easily traced; a transverse
   section through the inner canthns shows this layer to be continued
   forwards under the lachrymal caruncle into the ridge of <U+FB01>brous tissue
_ which     gives origin to the orbicalaris palpebrarum, and which, when
  detached from its surroundings, is called tendo palpebrara'm. When
      * This separation of the comparatively thin and simple mucosa along most of the
  course of the duct from the periosteum   was described by Robin and Cadiat (“ Journal
  de la Physiologic,” 1875, p. 497).

238        Prof. A. Macalister.        Notes on the Varieties and
simply cleaned and not detached, this shows, however, in its proper con
dition  as a simple ridge of this lachrymal aponeurosis.         Above and
below the level of the rictus palpebrarum this lachrymal aponeurosis
is continued outwards into the broad ligament of the eyelid, which is
attached along the orbital -margin, and with whose upper and inner
border the trochlea of the superior oblique has originally been struc
turally continuous. From the anterior or facial side of this lachrymal
aponeurosis the palpebral and ciliary parts of the orbicularis palpe
brarum are attached, from the posterior or orbital side the musculi
lachrymales   (<U+FB01>gs. 29, 30).
   The grooved portion of the lachrymal bone is frequently traversed
by very many <U+FB01>ne holes.            These are present even in very young
states of the bone (<U+FB01>g. 1), and are even more distinct in the fourth
month than in the bone of later age.         Sometimes, however, this part
of the bone remains quite cribriform (<U+FB01>g. 26), a condition never found
in the orbital part, which may have a few vascular holes or absorption
                         I
foramina, but which have never found uniformly perforate.
    The inner surface of the young lachrymal bone is covered with
a very thin vascular periosteum, which separates it from the ethmoidal
cartilage or bone.      As age advances, this becomes with dif<U+FB01>culty
separable,   and  the   underlying ethmoidal lamellaa become thin and
<U+FB01>nally become absorbed in parts; two lachrymo-ethmoidal                cells,
superior and inferior, become thus in the adult bounded by this bone
externally, and the partition ridge of the ethmoid sometimes becomes
ankylosed to the corresponding strengthened ridge of the lachrymal
bone.    In front of the superior ethmoidal cell, the lachrymal bone in
about 60 per cent. is for a short space in contact with the narial
mucous membrane, and in about the same proportion the posterior
inferior angle forms the outer boundary of that part of the infun
dibulum into which the anterior ethmoidal cells open.          The mucous
membrane which touches the bone is inseparable from the periosteum,
and is covered with ciliated epithelium.          The superior lachrymo
ethmoidal cell opens into the infundibulum external to the middle
 spongy bone, and above and behind the opening of the antrum. The
inferior opens lower down and farther forward into the same passage,
close to the fopening of the antrum.           In old persons the superior
 lachrymo-ethmoidal cell extends backwards under the 0s planum.
    The anterior margin of the uncinate process of the ethmoid articu
lated with the hollow of the crista in about 72 per cent. of the
specimens.
    VIII.  Six separate   ossicles  occur around the margins of the lachry
mal bone.     These are—
                1. Ossiculum ethmo-lachrymale       superius.
                2. Ossiculum ethmo-lachrymale       inferius.
                3. Ossiculum canalis naso-lachrymalis.

           Morphology of       the Human Lachrymal Bone,           5'0.      239
                 4. Ossiculum hamuli.
                 5. Ossiculum infra-orbitale.
                 6.  Ossiculum maxillo-frontale.
   Ossiculum ethmo-lachrymale         supe'rius (<U+FB01>gs. 11, 23).    In seven speci
       I
mens found        this small  ossicle  behind    the normal    lachrymal in the
upper part of the ethmo-lachrymal 'suture; in one of these, in a
Kal<U+FB01>r, the ossicle occupied the entire space of the small ethmo
lachrymal suture, above a long ascending ethmo-lacln'ymal spine of
the maxilla (<U+FB01>g. 23). In another specimen (<U+FB01>g. 11) the bone was large,
and also completely separated the ethmoid from the lachrymal.                This
form is described by Kranse (p. 69) as the os lachrymale posterius,
and in most cases it is, as he has described, a dismemberment of the
0s planum.     In one, however, I found this bone to overlie the ethmoid.
A similar ossicle is described by Henle (p. 129). In the large sized
forms it is really ethmoidal; in none did it extend back as far as the
anterior ethmoidal foramen. In these forms it is a persistence of a
commonly present separate centre of ossi<U+FB01>cation in the front of the os
planum (<U+FB01>g. 7).
   Ossiculum ethmo-Zachrymale inferius (<U+FB01>gs. 11, 18) is a similar bone,
not usually of ethmoidal origin, at the lowest part of the ethmo
lachrymal suture, between these bones and the maxilla.                In one case
only it was truly ethmoidal; in others it was supra-ethmoidal, and
seemed to be a separated ossicle of the infra-orbital plate of the
maxilla, which often (<U+FB01>g. 27) is irregularly cleft in this region.             In
<U+FB01>g. 11, it will be seen coexisting with a divided maxilla; and in
 <U+FB01>g. 23 a long cleft underlies the superior lachrymo-ethmoidal ossicle.
   Ossiculum oanalis naso-lachrymalis was so named by Gruber, and
is a small bone lying external to the bony or membranous hamulus,
and in front of the suture infra-M'bitalis transverse when such exists,
usually coexistent with a sutura verticalis, at the commencement of
which it is placed.          This bone was <U+FB01>rst described by Béclard
 (“Mémoires sur l’Osteose, Nouvelles Journal de Médecin,” IV,
 1819, p. 332), and afterwards by Rousseau (“Annales des Sciences
Naturelles,” XVII, 1829, p. 86, Pl. V).                Other anatomists have
referred to   it,  but  the  extensive   monograph on the subject by Pro
fessor Gruber (“Mém. de l'Acad. Imp. de St. Pétersbourg,”                     VII
 Series, vol. 24:, N0. 3) is so full that to it little can be added. Pro
fessor Gruber regards the bone described by Béclard as distinct from
the ossicle 0f Rousseau; but, While this maybe, the descriptions given
by these authors are not suf<U+FB01>ciently de<U+FB01>nite to enable us to decide.
In general, this bone is quite distinct from the hamulus, and coexists
with it in the majority of cases, and corresponds to a. variable amount
to the outer inferior edge of the lachrymal in one of my cases, com
 pletely excluding it from contact with the maxilla.
   The frequency of occurrence of this bone has been di<U+FB01>erently

240          Prof. A. Macalister.        Notes on the Varieties and
stated. Rousseau says <U+FB01>ve or six out of every ten; Gruber says in
the majority of cases ; Kranse, on the other hand, says in 20 per cent.
                  I
In my series, <U+FB01>nd that it is present as a distinct element in .32 per
cent., but that there are traces of its having been present in many
others in which it has lost its separateness by ankylosis, so that, on
the whole, there are traces of its existence in 55 per cent. of crania.
In shape it is crescentic, trigonal, quadrate, or irregular; in length it
varies from 0'5 millim. to 7 millims.           When the hamulus exists, the
ossicle is excluded from the lachrymal canal by it, and                 I  have never
found it stretching beneath the hamulus so            as  to come   into the wall of
the tube.      In cases of unossi<U+FB01>ed hamulus, it usually forms part of the
bony margin of the canal, dipping into it for not more than 1‘5
millims., and underlying the lachrymal branch of the infra-orbital
artery.     This ossicle always lies on the maxilla and indents it, and
not the lachrymal; and when it ankyloses, it is usually with the
maxilla, not with the lachrymal, unless in exceptional cases.                         In
nature    it  seems   to  be,  like  the  inferior  ethmo-lachrymal          ossicle,  a
detached ossicle of the maxilla, one of several ossi<U+FB01>c nuclei of the
orbital plate which has not coalesced with its neighbours.
    The ossic'ulum hamuli is a separate ossi<U+FB01>cation in the membranous
hamulus (<U+FB01>gs. 9, 13, 144, 15, 17, 21, 26) at the anterior attachment of
the membrane, that is, at the front border of the lachrymal groove,
separated by a vacant space or suture from the crista lachrymalis.
In this form       I have found it in 1% per cent.          Sometimes it is large,
extends backwards        and  replaces   the hamulus,     and  it may coexist with
the last ossicle and exclude it from the margin.               In some cases, one
ossicle of large size seems to replace the two (<U+FB01>g. 14!).              This bone is
always    at  the  margin  of  the  canal, and  never    coexists  with   a developed
 hamulus; in six specimens it encroached on the face, and formed the
pars facialis (<U+FB01>g. 13).
    The ossicul'um infraorbitale marginale (Gruber) is a small nodule in
 front of the malar, and belonging to it rather than to the lachrymal.
 I have found it to articulate with the lachrymal hamulus, with the
 ossiculu'm canalis, or with the assiculum hamuli, but                I   reserve the
 descriptions of these as they really belong to the malar bone.                  When
 ossi<U+FB01>ed to the malar, and extended to the lachrymal, they produce
 the condition of lachrymo-jugal suture (Gruber, Zoo. cit, “ Proc. Royal
 Irish Academy,” Nov. 1874, p. 58).
    Ossiculum maxilla-frontale is a bone present in              l per cent. of my
 specimens,     and  formed     by a  detached   slip  of  the  maxilla     along the
 upper part of the crista Zachrymalis anterior. This is the nebe'nthriinen
 bein of Luschka (“ Muller’s Archiv,” 1858, p. 304) which Krause <U+FB01>nds
 to exist in 3 per cent., a degree of frequency not present in my
 specimens. It is variable in size, usually an elongated triangle with
 its apex downwards articulating above with the frontal, posteriorly

  maxilla.    In others, it has partially ankylosed above and remains free
 below, its suture being in the plane of the sutura. imperfeatu of M. J.
 Weber.       This bone was <U+FB01>rst described by Rosenmiiller (“ Descr.
 partium ext. oculi,” Leipzig, 1797, p. 14), who found two instances.
 Budge (“ Henle u. Pfeufer’s Zeitschrift,” III, Series VII, p. 278) found
 it 6 times in 1.843, and Luschka found it 7 times out of 60. Com
 bining these with my 10 out of 1020 sets of bones, we get an
 average frequency of 23 in 1264, that is about 1 in 55.            Taking
 into consideration its relation to the suturu uotha, it seems probable that
 this must represent some element which tends to remain separate.
     In my instances, the detached process of bone was never wholly
 coextensive with the part isolated in other skulls by the sutura nothu,
 but it generally corresponded to it above. In the skull of Glorvina
 (Lady Morgan’s Wild Irish Girl) the ossicle on the right is completely
 detached, that on the left, where the bone was much larger, has
 become ankylosed to the maxilla for a little more than the lower
 half of its extent, and this arrangement       I have also found in three
 other instances.
     The suture notha, or suturu imperfectu, which is related to this
 ossicle, is remarkably constant in some form or other, usually as a
 row of holes into which branches of the infra-orbital artery pass
 (<U+FB01>g. 2).      Traces of its separateness sometimes continue on the
 inside of   the maxilla even when there is little sign on the outside,
 and not uncommonly a <U+FB01>ssure occurs traversing the whole thickness
 of the bone at one extremity, usually below but occasionally above.
 It   is, however, true that in the very large majority of maxillae no
separate continuous centre of ossi<U+FB01>cation can be isolated for this
region, but this part of the bone 'ossi<U+FB01>es continuously from the
anterior centre of the bone which arises below and internal to the
infra-orbital hole in the membrane of the face, during the latter days
of the <U+FB01>fth week of foetal life. Thus if this suture marks out an
element originally separate, it must have lost its distinctness at a
remote period.       The vessels perforating the maxilla along this line
pass to the ethmo-maxillary and maxillo-turbinal sutures, and end on
the nasal mucous surface along these lines; indeed, in general, this
suture marks the distinctness of that part of the nasal process of the
maxilla which overlies the anterior border of the ethmoid from that
part which intervenes between the ethmoid and the nasal, and the
ossicle last described corresponds to the upper part of the former
region.
    IX.   The history of the development of the human lachrymal bone
is interesting     as showing something of the limits within which
ossi<U+FB01>cation periods vary.       I have not been able to detect any trace of
bone until the eighth week. In one foetus of 4:25 centims., presumably

242        Prof. A. Macalister.     Notes on the Varieties and
eight weeks old,    I  found a bony centre on the right side, in front of
the nasal plate of the maxilla, but none on the left.       In a second of
 the same size,   both    had  begun to ossify,  while   in a ninth week
 fwtus I found no trace of bony growth.         In nine other foetuses of
eighth week age, I found the traces of beginning ossi<U+FB01>cation on both
sides in the form of single bony centres, which begin in the mem
brane overlying the ethmoidal cartilage, and lying at the back of the
lachrymal duct, which has a distinct lumen by this time.
   At or near the end of the third month in foetuses of 6—7 centims., the
portion contiguous to the orbital plate of the maxilla is ossi<U+FB01>ed, but
does not touch any of the developing bones around, except behind
and below the lachrymal grooves.          In fwtuses of the end of the
fourth month, the lower border is fully ossi<U+FB01>ed, and forms a suture
with the maxilla; ossi<U+FB01>cation has also extended rapidly upwards, so
that the upper margin touches the frontal.       The crista is developed,
and the orbital surface behind it is narrow, overlying the orbital
face of the ethmoidal cartilage, in which the <U+FB01>rst bony nodule does
not appear until the beginning of the thirteenth week.             At this
period, the lachrymal bone is somewhat trigonal, and measures 3'5
to 4 millims. long (average of eight), and in one of my specimens the
hamulus has begun to ossify even at this age.       Bony growth extends
more rapidly upwards and forwards than backwards, and the lachry
mal part of the bone is completed, except at the two ends, by the
end of the <U+FB01>fth month, when as yet the orbital part is comparatively
narrow.     Even at this stage, the anterior part is generally much
foraminated (<U+FB01>g. 1), and, while in contact with its other environing
bones, it has not yet touched the bony as planum (<U+FB01>gs. 6, 7), nor the
maxillo-turbinal cartilage.     The lowest part of the former is reached
at the  end  of the   <U+FB01>fth  or very early in the sixth month, when the
bone attains a length of 4'5 millims.        In the sixth month, it has
extended further back, and has increased in length to 5 millims. ; in
the seventh, it has attained nearly its adult shape, and it averages
6 by 3; in the eighth, all the margining          sutures are established,
except the lachrymo-ethmoidal,       where there is still for the upper
two-thirds an area of uncovered cartilage, and also for a short extent
anteriorly and superiorly.     The bone is now 6'25 by 4 millims., has
attained its adult shape, and in half my specimens has a developed
hamulus. In the ninth month, the average size is 7'5X5 millims.,
but there is yet an angle of cartilage above and behind un<U+FB01>lled.       The
hamulus is often fully ossi<U+FB01>ed even to its facial part; indeed,     I have
seen this state attained in one foetal skull of eight months.
   The ossiculum canalis nasa-laahrymah's is early in its appearance.

saw in a seven months skull.

             Morphology      of the  Human Laolzrymal Bone,     {Ya      243 _
     The contiguous part of the maxilla shows some noteworthy characters
in development, scattered bony nuclei appear in the infra-orbital
 membrane and in the membranous nasal process during the early
part of the sixth week, and in skulls of foetuses of 32 millims. long
 these have coalesced into continuous plates, one behind and below the
 lachrymal in the <U+FB02>oor of the orbit, the other in front and internal,
 and early continuous with the ossi<U+FB01>cation of the front of the maxilla.
 The latter arises by several nodules irregularly divided into two sets,
 one of which forms the crista lachrymalis anterior, the others coalesce
 to form the rest of the nasal process, but these early unite, and in
 thirty foetal skulls       I  have only once seen a distinct trace of a
 persistent    suture  between    these elements after the end of the third
 month.      There always, however, persists the row of vascular holes
 along this line becoming the suture notha of the adult.           The infra
 orbital nucleus consists at its <U+FB01>rst appearance of several irregularly
 elongated bony spicules beneath the infra-orbital nerve. Very
 rapidly, however, as these coalesce and extend forwards towards the
 brim of the orbit the bone rises above the nerve close to the orbital
 edge and forms a bony bridge over it. There is always a continuous
'layer of membrane over the nerve, thicker at the margineven before
 ossi<U+FB01>cation is detectible, traceable outward to the place where the
 malar is ossifying and onwards to the lachrymal region, and into
 this the bony growth extends.          The overlap is from without inwards,
 and the lip of bone growing over the nerve touches the continuous
 plate internally forming the suture infraorbitalis verticalis on the face.
This has formed and the infra-orbital foramen is quite bridged in at
 the end of the thirteenth week.            About the sixteenth week the
 margin of the outer lip of the infra-orbital canal extends over the
 nerve behind the brim of the orbit, and thus coalescing with the
  inner margin from before backwards forms the suture injraorbital'is
  longitudinalis.    The point where these two sutures unite varies in
 place and may be at, under, or internal to the anterior point of the
 malarbone, and, as in many cases, the part of the maxilla on which
 the malar abuts, is prolonged inwards to support the anterior inferior
 angle of that bone, it is not uncommon to <U+FB01>nd the front portion of
the sutura infraorbitalis running transversely inwards into the
 lachrymo-maxillary        suture, in this form the transversely-placed,
 inward-running       anterior   limb of the suture is sometimes known as
       suture,
 the            infraorbitalis transverse (Halbertsma), and when this is
 present the edge of the portion of the infra-orbital plate internal to
 the infra-orbital nerve is thereby excluded from the brim of the
  orbit.   The ossiculum canalz's is the terminal nodule of ossi<U+FB01>cation in
  the in-jutting extremity of the process from without.

 the orbital border is as variable in the twelve foetal crania under four
 months which       I  have now before me as in the same number of adult
 skulls.
    Of the later changes taking place in the development of the
 lachrymal bone the principal is the assumption of a more vertical
 position.      The embryonic lachrymal until the end of the eighth month
 is inclined    inwards at an angle of from 60° to 70°, but after birth it
 rapidly becomes more vertical and the surface develops its outward
 concavity from above downwards, the <U+FB01>rst appearance of which
 immediately precedes birth.        The degree of obliquity of the fwtal
 lachrymal at birth may be represented by an inter-lachrymal index,
 that is, the maximum distance between the upper margins of the two
 lachrymal bones multiplied by 100, divided by the maximum distance
 between the lowest margin of the two bones.           This in ninth month
 skulls averages 72.
    X. In the adult the position and obliquity of the lachrymal bone
 depends on several factors, the'size of the orbits, the internasal
 width, the width of the respiratory region of the nose, the degree of
 projection of the frontal bone, all in<U+FB02>uence it. The curve of the
 surface is not uniform, the lower third being generally turned rather
 sharply outward.         The simplest method of estimating       both the
 obliquity and curvature of the surfaces is by comparing the relative
 distances between the respective points of the two lachrymal bones.
 The average superior inter-lachrymal width or distance between the
posterior superior angles of the two lachrymals is 252 millims.         The
 posterior inferior inter-lachrymal        width or distance between the
posterior inferior angles, measured from the point of contact of
lachrymal, ethmoid, and maxilla on each side is 30 millims., and the
anterior inferior inter-lachrymal       width, or that between the most
divergent points of the two lachrymals, the extreme inferior point of
the crista (not taking the hamulns into account), is 33'41 millims
The amount of inclination may be expressed by two indexes which            I
may call the anterior and posterior inter-lachrymal indexes.            The
latter of these (superior inter-lachrymal         width X100, divided by
posterior inferior inter-lachrymal        width), indicates the degree of
obliquity      of  the upper two      thirds   of the bone.    The former
  s . i. 10 X 100
                     indicates the obliquity plus the onrve of the lower
(    a..1.'.i.w
third, the amount of which can be estimated by comparison of the
two indexes. The average anterior inter-lachrymal index =75, the
average posterior :84. The former index decreases with increasing
splay of the lower margin, the latter with increasing               general
obliquity.
    These degrees of obliquity seem to vary in different races.      In the
crania of negroes from South-West Africa the bone is most vertical;

  XI. Comparative Anatomy and Morphology. The lachrymal bone
is a splint developed in the membrane overlying the outer side of the
ethmoid, and in mammals            formed in close relation to the nasal
                                   it    is
duct.    I have not found, in any human embryos, specimens young
enough to show the earliest stages of the formation of the duct, but
my examinations of sections of this region in rats and pigs con<U+FB01>rms
the description of the develoPment of the duct given by Born and
Legal      Morph. Jahrbuch,” viii, 1882, p. 353), according to whom
          (“
it   arises, not as Coste believed, by the closure of the surface
over the persistent oculo-nasal groove, but by the in-projection
of a column of epithelial cells from the surface in the line between
the eye and the nose, the column becoming afterwards bridged by
mesoblast, and developing a lumen.     This agrees with the mode of
development observed among the lower Vertebrates by Born. Before
any trace of ossi<U+FB01>cation appears in man the duct has a distinct
lumen.
   The formation of a double nasal duct      thus easily explicable, as
                                                             is
produced by the interjection of a vertical fold of mesoblast into the
column of cells. In the one instance of this very rare condition met
with by me in the dissecting room, and now in the Cambridge
Museum, there was a septum in the lachrymal sac, not quite dividing
it into two, nor stretching above the level of the vestibule, this was
continued into the nasal duct, completely dividing       for its upper       it
fourth, each surface being clothed with ciliated epithelium.       The
septum ceased about the middle of the duct, ending obliquely, and
from this to the inferior opening the tube was single, but its lower
                                                                                           n     2

end was crossed by a bridge of mucous membrane subdividing it
into two.
    In man, ossi<U+FB01>cation commences in the membrane behind and
internal to the lachrymal sac and duct independently of the ossi<U+FB01>ca
tion in the bridge of tissue overlying the tube. The former gives
rise to the lachrymal bone, the latter to the nasal process of the
maxilla.
    The development of the bony environment of the sac is, however,
variable among mammals, and three distinct types are met with:
let, that in which the pre- and post-lachrymal ossi<U+FB01>cation are continu
ous, and the bone forms a complete girdle for the nasal duct and a
large element of the interorbital region of the face; 2nd, that in which,
while still engirdliug the lachrymal sac, the bone is reduced to a
small thin lamella; and 3rdly, the form in which the lachrymal bone
is con<U+FB01>ned to the post-lachrymal region.
    The <U+FB01>rst form is met with among the lower and more generalised
mammals. In all the Didelphia it is thus large, and has a wide
lachrymo-jugal suture, larger in the carnivorous than in the herbi
vorous forms, but in none excluding the maxilla from the frontal.
    Among the Ungnlates the bone is large, with a large facial region.
In many it has a large lachrymo-nasal suture, and excludes the maxilla
from the frontal super<U+FB01>cially.    This is the case in Rhinoceros, Hippo
potamus, many pigs, horse, Bos, Oreas, Tragelaphns, and many
Artiodactyles, but there is a maxillo-frontal suture in Hyrax, some
pigs, camels, Hyaamoschus, &c.     In the pig there are often accessory
lachrymal ossicles in the lachrymo-frontal suture.
    Among all these the lachrymal tends to ankylose with the frontal
and malar, not with the maxilla.          The same large form exists
through the Edentata and Sirenia, and a smaller form of the same
kind among the Rodents. The chief variation among these last is
the presence or absence of a jugal contact.        There is a lachrymo
jugal suture among the Sciuromorphs and Myomorphs, and a few of
the Hystricomorphs, such as Lagostomus, but it is generally absent
among the other porcupine allies, owing to the shortening of the
 malar, not to any great alteration in the lachrymal, which in most
 Rodents has a larger facial than orbital surface, though not much of
 either. The Elephant, rodent-like in all its features, agrees with the
 Hystricomorphs in this.
    Among Carnivores the lachrymal is small, forms but a small incon
 spicuous element of the orbital margin, and from its condition of
 moderate size among Cynoids diminishes both towards (Eluroids and
 Arctoids, but especially towards the latter, among whom it appears
 as a very small lamina.    It becomes still smaller among Pinnipeds,
 appearing in some like Callocephalus and Halichoerus as an exceed
 ingly slender, often scarcely ossi<U+FB01>ed, detached scales, which is lost in

             Morphology of   the Human    Lachrymal Bone,    (j-c.      247
 most macerated skulls, and seems to be quite absent in Otaria and
  Cystophora.
    The Prosimii preserve the same type of bone, but in adult skulls
 its early ankylosis with the maxilla renders it often difficult to
 isolate. They have all well-marked lachrymo-jugal           sutures with
 lachrymo-maxillary     sutures  both  in  front  and  behind    the malar.
  Chiromys has a large premaxillo-lachrymal       suture, but this   I have
 not noted in any other Lemuroid.
    Among the Primates, the two types of smaller lachrymal exist. It
 is large, facial, and articulates with the nasal in Mycetes; smaller
 facial, and perforate in Ateles with a wide outreaching hamulus,
 whose lower surface partly roofs in the infra-orbital canal. In Cebus
 Pithecia, Callithrix, and Nyctipithecus it is imperforate, but has a very
 large hamulus, and the same form exists among the Arctopithecus.        In
 Callithrix, from the peculiar construction and absorption of the
 interorbital septum, the back of the small lachrymal is bounded by a
 fronto-maxillary suture, and the same exists in Nyctipithecus.
    The Catarrhines present several varieties of form; the perforate
 form with the continuous anterior margin is present in Cercopithecus
 and Macacus, while the anterior bar is medially interrupted in Semno
 pithecus and Nasalis.     Macacus nemestrinus alone has a lachrymo
jugal suture, among the Catarrhines.       The hamulus in all the cynoid
 Catarrhines is very deep and wide, extending usually to the face and
 spreading outwards far into the <U+FB02>oor of the orbit.
    The Gorilla has a long upper angle ascending forward to the frontal,
 and a short ethmoidal suture. As in all the other Catarrhines, the
 lower end of the lachrymal process projects, shelf-like, forwards.      In
 <U+FB01>ve skulls    I  found a sutura_ notha and a sutura infraorbitalis
 verticalis.
    The Orang has a long sharp hamulus, so placed that its edges look
out and in, its surfaces up and down. The Chimpanzee has also a
 small lachrymal with a wide hamulus.
    By following the la‘chrymal bone downwards among Vertebrates,
something of the stages whereby it has become specialised from the
inner elements of the suborbital ring of dermal ossicles, can be
traced.
    Among birds the bone occupies a position comparable with that in
mammals, is exceedingly variable in form, not pierced by the
lachrymal duct, and often attended with accessory ossicles, one
(falcons, &c.), two (pu<U+FB02>ins, &c.), three (Procellaria, &c.), or four
(Psophia).
    Among Reptiles the    same inner region of the orbit is occupied by
two dermal ossicles, membrane-prefrontal and lachrymal, and occa
sionally by small granular accessory ossicles as well. Among the Am
phibians, in the skulls of some of the extinct Labyrinthodonts, such

    248          Prof. A. Macalister.         lVotes on the Varieties and
    as Trematosaurus,    there are bones in this region probably of the same
    nature, and comparing these with the suborbital ring in teleost <U+FB01>shes,
‘
    such as the salmon, the innermost of the series seems so plainly to
    represent the lachrymal that Professor Parker has a<U+FB01>ixed this name
    to it in his <U+FB01>gures (<U+FB01>g. 21, “ Morphology of the Skull ”).
       The lachrymal bone has been inherited by the mammalia in its
    large facial form, and it participates with its neighbouring bones in
    the <U+FB01>xity correlated with the setting apart of the jaws for mastica
    tion.    The upper jaw must be <U+FB01>xed to give attachment to the
    masseter, which in most of the lower mammals exceeds the temporals

    part, and all these marginal elements tend to ankylose into a continu
    ous bony ring.
         While   theseconditions persist the bones retain the same relative
    place, and we can correlate the changes in structure with changes in
    function.    Among the Primates the approximation to parallelism of
    the orbital axes diminishes largely the extent of all the elements of the
    interorbital septum and    iscorrelated with     strengthened rim of the
                                                              a
    orbit, especially with an increase in strength in the fronto-jugal pier
    of the suborbital arch, which now bears the entire masseteric strain.
    The increase in size of the cranial cavity, together with the
    diminished interorbital width causes the duct to become entorbital,
    and   it descends   obliquely downwards and outwards in the lower
    forms, nearly vertically in man; the degree of obliquity depending on
    the width of the inferior nasal meatus and the narrowness of the
    interorbital septum.     When the duct     obliquely placed the hamulus
                                                       is
    is  large and bony to bear off pressure; when vertical the hamulus
    diminishes.    While the duct     thus entorbitally displaced, the plane
                                         is
    of the teeth     almost completely preorbital, and the pressure of the
                    is
    teeth  is borne by the frontal process of the maxilla in front of the
    orbit, while the masseteric tension     borne by 'malar bone. Owing to
                                                is

                  Morphology             of    the   Human Lachry-mal Bone,                61:.       249
   Professor Gegenbaur, in his valuable paper on the pars facial'is of
the lachrymal bone (“ Morph. Jahrbuch,” 1882, p. 173), has pointed
out that the hamulus is the passage between the pars facialis and the
pars orbitalis.   The former, present as a de<U+FB01>nite element in 4'25 per
cent. of orbits         is,
                   as he has indicated, an atavism.
   In man the nasal process of the maxilla very early projects in front
of the anterior border of the ethmoidal lateral mass, and thus
encroaches    on the territory which in earlier conditions was only
occupied by the lachrymal.        The ossi<U+FB01>cation, extending upwards,
stretches on both sides of those branches of the infra-orbital artery,
which turn in to terminate on the mucosa clothing the front of the
ethmoid, making thus the line of vessels or sutnra notha.
   In the development of the large lachrymal bone of the pig ossi<U+FB01>ca
tion springs from a common centre, from which       extends around the         it
duct. In man, in those cases wherein an ossiculum hamuli exists,
there      really a second ossi<U+FB01>c centre in the bone, and in those
             is
instances in which an ossiculum maxillo-frontale      exists, this bony
segment of that part of the nasal process of the maxilla overlying the
ethmoid has had its special centre. All these facts are instructive as
showing the comparatively low morphological value of mere centres
of ossi<U+FB01>cation.

        Heat and   the  Electric Action of Metals in Electrolytes.    251
“ Some Relations of Heat to Voltaic and Thermo-electric Action
      of Metals in Electrolytes.” By G. GORE, LL.D., F.R.S.
      Received November 14. Read November 22, 1883.
   In several papers  on the “Thermo-electric Properties of Liquids,” &o.,
more particularly those in the “Philosophical Magazine,” January,
1857; the “ Proc. Roy. $00.,” No. 188 (1878), pp. 513—543; No. 199
(1879), and N o. 208 (1880),         I  have shown the thermo-electric
behaviour of numerous liquids with electrodes of platinum             and
mercury; and to a. small extent with those of palladium, gold, silver,
copper, and iron.      In the present research, the subject has been
examined in a di<U+FB01>erent aspect, the object now being to ascertain the
thermo-electric actions of a series of metals in particular liquids ; and
to examine the relations of the thermo-electric to the chemico-electric
behaviour of metals in electrolytes, and to ordinary chemical corrosion,
and the source of voltaic currents.
   The following apparatus and method was employed for the thermo
electric experiments (see <U+FB01>g. 1). Two thin glass vessels of the form
shown in the sketch, the cups of which were about 4 cm. wide and
5 cm. deep, with open legs 6 cm. long, and 13 mm. diameter, were
                                   FIG-- 1.
<U+FB01>xed in a piece of wood, and the limbs connected by an in'dia-rubber
tube.    In using it to ascertain the thermo-electric behaviour of a
particular metal with a liquid, the <U+FB02>exible tube was closed by a pinch
tap, one limb and cup was nearly <U+FB01>lled with the cold liquid, then the
hot liquid (previously heated in a large closed <U+FB02>ask) poured into the
other; the pinch tap then taken off, the pieces of same metal wholly

  252         Dr. G. Gore.      Relations  of Heat  to Voltaic and
  immersed in the liquid, and then connected with the galvanometer.
  Thermometers were supported in the liquid of the two cups, and the
  temperatures of the two portions of liquid and pieces of metal were
  in every case (except otherwise stated) 60° and 160° F. respectively. All
  the metals and compounds employed were the purest I could obtain,
  and liquids were avoided which would yield a metallic deposit upon
  the metals.     A series of metals and one liquid were examined at a
  time. The most frequently recurring dif<U+FB01>culty in the research was
  polarisation.    In all the cases the thermal, electrolytic, and polarisa
  tion effects, produced in the liquids at the electrodes by the passage
  of the current, in<U+FB02>uence and modify the results by secondary
  action. When also the current is su<U+FB01>iciently strong, the positive
  metal is corroded.
    . By these means the thermo-electric      couples found with one liquid  I
  and a series of metals were <U+FB01>rst classed into two groups, viz., those
  in which the metal was thermo-electro-positive, and those in which it
  was negative.        To determine the series from the two groups, two
  similar apparatuses, as already described, were simultaneously used,
  one containing two pieces of one of the metals A, and the other, two
  of another metal B, from the same thermo-electric group, and so
  connected in single series, that the two currents opposed each other,
  and the one alone of greatest E.M.F. de<U+FB02>ected the needle of the
  galvanometer.        The following table exhibits the results, and the
  poaition of each metal in order of electro-motive power to the one
  next below, and to that next above it in the series, was thus in every
  case experimentally ascertained.        The top metal in each column is
  the most positive in the particular liquid; and the metals above the
  dividing lines are those from which the current proceeds from the
  hot piece through the liquid to the cold one, and the ones below those
  lines the reverse.                                      _
      The proportions of substances dissolved in each ounce of water to
  form the solutions were as follows: of potassic cyanide (containing
  93'52 per cent. of the actual substance),       <U+FB02>uoride, bromide, nitrate,
  iodide, chloride, sulphate and hydrate, sodic diphosphate, chloride,
  sulphate, potash alum and ammonia alum, 10 grains each, potassic
  carbonate 12 grains, anhydrous magnesic sulphate 4'8 grains, oxalic
  acid 2 grains, dextro-tartaric acid 1 grain, chloric acid 6 minims,
  hydrochloric,    formic (sp. gr. 1'18), sulphuric, and nitric acids
  1}   minims   each.    The liquids were selected of such a strength as
  was considered      to be the most suitable, especially as regards rate of
  corrosion and strength of current.       It was necessary in these experi
'
  ments to continually remember that the results vary considerably
  with di<U+FB02>’erent specimens of the same metal, even when the metal is
  very pure and the pieces of it are cut from different parts of the
  same sheet.

   Remarka—Of the foregoing                         in which the metals
                                                cases, only those
are not at all corroded, are entirely thermo-electric, the remainder are
concrete ones involving the additional in<U+FB02>uences of ordinary chemical
corrosion and of voltaic action, and this fact must be remembered.
   The currents were feeble in solutions of hydrochloric, formic, and
dextro-tartaric acids, notwithstanding that the corrosion of the more
electro-positive metals appeared to be as strong as usual, and the
currents were so weak with cadmium in formic, and cadmium and
gold in tartaric acid, that the positions of those metals as given in
columns 13 and 141 are uncertain.       The direction of the currents
obtained with     aluminium, also with magnesium,   in a solution of one
grain of lsevo-tartaric acid per ounce   of water, was the same as in a
solution of the same strength of ordinary or dextro-tartaric acid. By
opposing to each other also the thermo-electric currents from those
 two solutions either with aluminium or magnesium, that from the one
 of the leave-acid was in each case found to have slightly the greatest
 electric potential.
       In     some      experiments, the strength of thermo-electric

   The thermo-electric order of metals in liquids was with every
solution widely different from the ordinary thermo-electric order of
metals alone, with no one liquid did more than three out of the
thirteen metals agree in position in both the orders. It       remarkable              is
that magnesium, a metal so very corrodible, so highly chemico-electro
positive, and so considerably thermo-electro-positive, in the series of
metals only,      so often the most thermo-electro-negative
                     is                                           in these
series; in each case however where magnesium was at or near the
bottom of the thermo-electric series,        was covered with

of simple chemical character, such as potassic cyanide, <U+FB02>uoride,

gave the largest number of negative ones.              I  have not examined

in solutions of potassic hydrate and chloric acid, and similarly with
the thermo-positive metals platinum and palladium, each in eleven
di<U+FB01>'erent liquids, and with aluminium in solution of potassic hydrate,
sodic sulphate, and ammonia alum.             The usually thermo-negative
metal iron was more frequently positive than any other metal, it was
strongly so in solutions of potassic bromide, hydrochloric acid, caustic
potash, and sodic sulphate, and so also was the thermo-negative metal
cadmium in solution of caustic potash.
    The liquids in which the hot metal was thermo-electro-positive             in
the largest proportion of cases were those containing highly electro
positive bases, such as the alkali metals; thus, the highly chemico
electro- and thermo-electro-positive body potassium, forms the highly
thermo-electro-negative compounds potassic cyanide, <U+FB02>uoride, bromide,
nitrate, carbonate, and iodide. From a much smaller number of facts,
I    had previously drawn the conclusion that, provided ordinary
chemical action is absent, liquids of alkaline reaction are usually
thermo-electro-negative, and acid ones, thermo-electro-positive.             This
is largely con<U+FB01>rmed in the present table in the cases of the least
 corrodible metals, gold and platinum.
    In every experiment of this kind, the two pieces of metal were
 simultaneously immersed'in the hot and cold portions of liquid respec
 tively, and no cases of reversal of direction of current therefore
 occurred; many would have happened had the metals been slowly
 heated in the liquids.     In a subsequent series of similar experiments,
 in which the one limb of the vessel was gradually heated after immer
 sion of the electrodes, a number of such instances were observed (see
 p. 281). Bleekrode also (“ Poggendor<U+FB02>'s Aunalen,” 1870, vol. cxxxviii,
             “                                                   “
 p. 571 ;      Annales de Chimie,” April, 1870 ; also              Philosophical
  Magazine,” 1870,    vol. X], p. 311) has  recorded   a few  of  such  cases.
    In order to obtain a thermo-electric series of all the strongest
 thermo-positive and negative couples in Table I, the electric potentials
 of most of the top and bottom couples were measured.             The remaining
 members were omitted because          their  currents   were  very variable in
 potential, probably in consequence of polarisation, and of alterations
 of rapidity of di<U+FB01>usion of the layers of liquid in contact with the
 electrodes.     The electric potential usually declines quickly (but
  occasionally only a little), hence the numbers obtained depend upon
  the degree of rapidity with which the determinations are made. The

time usually occupied varied from one to two minutes.                                All the
measurements, except those of Tables XI and XIV (pp. 273 and 277),
were made by balancing the current to be measured, by one of equal
potential from two thermo-electric piles, each consisting of about
300 pairs of iron and German silver wires, the accuracy of which was
cccasionally tested by means of a Clark’s standard cell<U+FB01>“                              (For a

    With the two pieces of metal at 60° and 160‘ F. respectively, the
following numbers and series were found, in which the top couple of
the upper section is the most positive, and the bottom one of the lowest
division is the most negative.

   Remarks—The current from the strongest pair in this series had
about one hundred times greater potential than that from a single pair
of bismuth and antimony with an equal di<U+FB02>erence of temperature.
   Not only were the thermo-electro-positive combinations of metals
and electrolytes about double the number of the negative ones (see
Table I) : but the range of potential of the strongest of the former
was about 4'12 times that of the latter, as shown by this table.                 The
facts that there is a much larger number of thermo-electro-positive
metals than of thermo-negative ones; also of thermo-electro-positive
combinations of metals with liquids than of negative ones, and that
the positive elements of each of these classes are usually the strongest,
indicate that electro-positive action in metals generally is more fre
quently increased than decreased by rise of temperature.
   In the present table, the acids in contact with the chemico-electro
negative metals platinum, gold, and palladium, are thermo-electro
 positive; and in contact with the positive ones, aluminium and
 nickel, they appear negative.             In this table also, as in Table I,
aluminium, a strongly chemico-electro-positive metal, is conspicu
ously the most thermo-electro-positive one.                  The highly chemico
electro-negative    metals    also, silver,  palladium,    gold, and platinum, are
 present only in the thermo-negative division.              In apparent opposition
to this, but still largely in accordance with Table I, it is remarkable
that magnesium, a metal highly 'chemico-electr0~positive,                    and also
considerably thermo-positive         in   the series of  metals    only,  is the most
thermo-negative in this series (see also pp. 255, 261, 270, and 278).
    In order to ascertain the in<U+FB02>uence of strength of liquid upon the
sequence of the various thermo-electric series, another set of experi
ments, similar to those of Table I, was made, with all the solutions of
<U+FB01>ve times the strength, except those of sodic diphosphate, which was
four times, and those of potassic and ammonic alum, and potassic sul
phate, each of which was only three times.              The results are shown in

   * Indicates a gradual reversal with one metal only.
   1' Indicates that a temporary reversal occurred when the currents from the two
contiguous metals (i.e., the one marked and the one above           it) were opposed. A
few reversals also took place with non-contiguous metals.
    Remarks.——This          table contains 2342 per cent., or a proportion of         1
to 3'27, of instances of metals thermo-electro-negative                  in liquids. A
comparison of it with Table              I shows that a large increase of strength
of liquid increased the number of instances of metals thermo-positive
 in liquids from 199 to 219, or from 69'58 to 7668 per cent., thereby
further showing the in<U+FB02>uence of the liquid upon the apparent thermo
electric character of the metal, and indicating that increased con
centration of the solution was usually accompanied, either by an
increase of thermo-electroi-negative, or decrease of thermo-electro
positive property of the liquid; or that the metals, under the new
 condition, were more electro-positive.                 N0 thermo-electric reversals
 occurred during the experiments for making Tables                    I and 1V, because
 the metals were not gradually heated.                                         -
    Increased strength of liquid also greatly altered the order of the
 series in every case, and produced a very large number of reversals of
 position or of relative electro-motive force of the metals; out of the
 total 286 instances, 36 only were not reversed.                With some particular
 strength of liquid, therefore, intermediate between those employed in
 forming the two tables, the currents from each two metals, which were
 reversed in position, must balance each other.                     Many reversals of

             Thermo-electrio    Action of Metals in Electrolytes.                  261
thermo-electric sign also of single metals occurred, and in all these,
viz., 64, with‘ some intermediate strength of liquid, and the two
pieces of metal at 60° and 160° F. respectively, no thermo-electric
current would be produced. Magnesium suffered a very great depres
sion of electro-motive force from near the top to quite the bottom of
the series in solution of potassic <U+FB02>uoride by increased strength of the
liquid; and many other great changes of position of metals in other
solutions were similarly produced.
    The depression of magnesium to about the bottom of the thermo
electric series in nine different liquids in Table I, and about the same
number in Table IV, may have been due to the already-mentioned
(p. 255) circumstance that in all the solutions, except those of acids
and salts of acid reaction, magnesium becomes coated with an
adherent <U+FB01>lm of white basic salt. In not one of the solutions of acids
or acid salts was magnesium thus coated, or its position depressed.
On the other hand, the coating of basic salt had no such e<U+FB01>ect in the
solution of weak potassic <U+FB02>uoride; if also the coating caused the
magnesium to be thermo-electro-negative in so many liquids, the hot
magnesium would probably have been positive at the <U+FB01>rst instant of
immersion, before the coating had time to suf<U+FB01>ciently form, but it was
not. (See Table I, Notes.)
    Both in weak and strong solutions, silver, copper, palladium, and
cadmium usually gave thermo-currents of the least electro-motive
force, and aluminium and nickel were conspicuously thermo-positive
and platinum and magnesium frequently the most thermo-negative.
    Many of these results agree with the circumstance that with un
equally heated metals in liquids, great changes of strength, and even
reversals of current, frequently occur without any apparent cause, but
probably in consequence of alteration of chemical composition and

    Some experiments were made to ascertain the effect of pre-boiling
the liquid upon the degree of thermo-electric potential.                                  With the
two pieces of metal at 60° and 160° F. respectively, the results are as
given in Table V (p. 261).
    With the object of ascertaining the in<U+FB02>uence of degree of con
centration of the liquid upon the thermo-electric potential, the degrees
of potential of nearly all the currents from the top and bottom
members of the series in Table IV were measured by the method of
balance (see p. 257) ; those only being omitted which were very

 264            Dr. G. Gore.           Relations       of IIeat    to    l'oltaic and
 thermo-electric potential was decreased by increased strength of
 liquid, there were only three in which it was increased,‘ and both the
 total and average amount of decrease was greater than that of
increase.
     The determinations in Table VII of the thermo-electric potentials of
 metals in liquids, the pieces of metal being at 60° and 160° F. respec
tively, illustrate more fully the in<U+FB02>uence of strength of liquid.
     Remarks—In <U+FB01>fteen cases the thermo-electric potential was de
 creased, and in eight increased by additional strength of liquid, and
the total amount of decrease was greater than that of increase.                                As
greater strength of solution was usually attended by decreased
thermo-electric potential, it would be interesting to ascertain whether
 this was related in any degree to the diminished speci<U+FB01>c heat of the
liquid, or to changes of diffusive power of its constituents.
     The following additional determinations of thermo-electric potential
by the method of balance were also made with electrodes at 60° and
 160°   F. respectively.

    No di<U+FB01>erence of potential was observable on opposing the current
from two thermo-electric couples of tin in solution of potassic cyanide,
one being composed of large electrodes and the other of small ones.
By opposing those from the same metal and liquid, the one couple
having a large hot electrode and a small cold one, and the other the
reverse,    no de<U+FB01>nite result occurred.                                               v
    Very    few researches          have    been made       on the thermo-electric pro

pp. 353—411, 1858) has shown that when two vertical columns of

di<U+FB01>erent electrolytes at 60° F., of di<U+FB01>erent speci<U+FB01>c gravities, and not
mutuallyr decomposable, are placed end to end upon each other as
distinct strata in mutual contact, the lighter one being the upper
most, and the junction of the two is heated, a thermo-electric current
is produced. He has also shown that this current varies in strength
with the kind of solution and the degree of its concentration.—That
the electromotive force of the resulting current is nearly proportional
to the difference of temperature up to that of 50° of the portions
of liquid at the contact surface—That with two p0rtions of solution
of different degrees of strength of the same salt, the current passes
from the weaker to the stronger one.—-And that when equal volumes
of the two solutions contain chemically equivalent weights of salts of
two di<U+FB01>erent metals, the order of the liquids in electric tension series
is the same as that of their metals. Further, that the order of the
series with solutions of all neutral salts of the type R.SO4, agrees
 with that of the ordinary chemico-electric series of their metallic bases
in the case of salts of K, Na, Mg, Mn, Fe, Ni, CO, Zn, Cu, and Ag,

 Solutions of the salts KC], KBr, KI, also follow a similar order, but
 those agreeing with the formula R,03so_., do not obey this rule, nor
 do acids in general.
    E. Becquerel also (“ Annales de Chimie et de Physique, ” 4th series,
 1866, vol. vii, pp. 392—397) similarly heated the mutual contact
 portions of two electrolytes about 10° to 80°, and found the following
 e<U+FB02>'ects : A saturated solution of sulphate of copper was positive to a
 mixture of 1 part of sulphuric acid and 19 parts of water; water
 acidulated with hydrochloric acid was positive to a solution of sodic
 chloride, rendered alkaline by caustic potash; strong nitric acid was
 positive to a solution of 1 part of caustic potash in 10 parts of water;
 solution of cadmium sulphate was positive to a dilute one of ammonia
 chloride, and no current was produced by heating the junction of a
 solution of persulphide of potassium and a diluted one of the same salt.

 knowledge respecting the relation of thermo-electric          action of
 liquids and metals to chemico-electric action, the chemico-electric

266        Dr. G. Gore.      Relations   of Ileat t0 Voltaic   and
positions in serib's of all the foregoing combinations of metals and
liquids were determined at the temperatures of 60° and 160° F.
respectively, in order to compare the two series, and ascertain
how far the di<U+FB01>erences in chemico-electric position at different tem
peratures agreed with the thermo-electric relations of the particular
combinations of metal and liquid at those temperatures.                All the
solutions were of the same degree of strength as those used in form

the next above it.
    Remarks.-—The currents obtained from two contiguous base metan
were usually much stronger than those from contiguous                       noble
ones.      The in<U+FB02>uence of rise of temperature in altering the relative
pasitions of the various metals in the series may be rendered more
 evident by drawing cross lines between those which are altered.                 It
might have been supposed that as chemical action is usually increased
by heat, the hot piece of metal would in nearly every instance have
been either more electro-positive or less electro-negative than the cold
 one, and that the orders of the chemico-electric series of metals with
 each liquid at 160° would have been nearly always the same as at
 60° F.      The results exhibited by Table X, however, show that out
 of 22 liquids, in two only, viz., dilute hydrochloric acid and solution
 of potassic bromide, was the order of the hot series of metals exactly
 the same as that of the cold one. In all these cases of voltaic as well
 as of thermo-electric action, change of temperature was attended by
 change of electric state.
    By tabulating separately, and comparing the numbers of instances
 in which the respective metals occur on the several lines of Tables I
 and X, it will be at at once seen that in the thermo-electric series the
 metals generally, whilst occupying the same parts of the table as those

             Therm-o-electric  Action of illetals in Electrolytes.       269
 of the chemicaelectric ones, are much more distributed, those of each
 particular metal occupying about double the number of lines. This
 probably indicates that in these thermo-electric actions voltaic in<U+FB02>u
 ence modi<U+FB01>ed the effects ; also that heating one of the pieces of metal
 only of a voltaic pair usually increased the amount of their electric
 difference, making most metals more positive and some more negative,
 whilst heating the second one also, usually neutralised to some extent
 the effect of heating the <U+FB01>rst one only.
     Tabulating the members thus also shows that gold and platinum
 are the least distributed of the metals of the thermo-electric series,
 they are also the least corrodible.      Platinum, gold, palladium, and
silver occupy   in all cases  the lower half only of the table in the voltaic
series, and in nearly all cases also in the thermo series.       Aluminium,
 tin, and iron preponderate in the upper section of both tables. These
 facts also indicate that voltaic in<U+FB02>uence operates in most of these
 thermo-electric actions. An examination of Table        II further supports
 this conclusion.
     As the electrical effect of heating a voltaic couple may be viewed
  as being in a greater degree composed of the united consequences of
  heating each of the two metals separately (see pp. 270, 271, and 281),
  I have compared the chemico-electric series in the weak solutions at
  60° F., Table X, p. 267, side by side with the thermo-electric ones of
 the same metals in the same liquids of Table I, in a similar manner as
  the two chemico series are themselves compared. By such a com
 parison it was found that magnesium, zinc, and cadmium su<U+FB01>ered
 usually very great depressions of position and electromotive force in
 the series by the in<U+FB02>uence of heat (see pp. 276, 278). In such a table
  of comparison, magnesium was depressed 21 times through a total
 of 144 places; zinc was lowered 20 times through a sum of 123, and
 raised through 1 only; and cadmium sank 17 times through 87, and
 r0se 3 times through a total of 8. All these numbers follow the same
 order as the speci<U+FB01>c gravities, atomic weights, and speci<U+FB01>c heats of
 those metals. All the other metals behaved in a very different manner
 from this.    The same effects may be rendered evident in another way
 by tabulating the number of instances in which each of those metals
respectively occurs in the several lines of Table         I and of the cold
columns of Table X. Tables I and         II  also show that, notwithstand
ing the highly volta-positive character of this group of metals, mag
nesium was thermo-negative 10, cadmium 8, and zinc 7 times, and
that they were nearly as often thermo-negative as silver. This e<U+FB02>‘ect
is least conspicuous with the weak solutions of potassic chloride, carbo
nate, and hydrate, and was not manifestly affected by increased strength
of liquid. The similar behaviour in this respect of the whole of the
magnesium group of metals, suggests the conclusion that the frequent
and great depressions in position of magnesium in the thermo-electric
                                                                T 2

270          Dr. G. Gore.       Relations of [feat  to Voltaic and
 series (Tables    I and IV, pp. 253 and 259) were not always due to a
 <U+FB01>lm of insoluble matter (pp. 261, 270, and 278). I have not .examined
 whether this phenomenon is related to the great thermal capacity and
 expansibility by heat of those metals. The liquid in which the metals
 generally were least altered in position by heating one of them was
 the weak solution of potassic chloride, it suffered also very few voltaic
 reversals by rise of temperature (see Table X, p. 266).
    By making similar comparisons of the thermo series of Table with    I
 the “ hot
              "
                 chemico series of Table X, it was observed, that whilst
 heating only one metal of a voltaic pair to 160° F. depressed the
 relative positions of the magnesium group of metals a total of 354
 places, and raised them only 9 (see p. 269) ; heating subsequently the
~second one in addition, raised them from the latter position a total of
 345 places, and depressed them only 5, and therefore restored them
 nearly 98 per cent. towards their former positions. This appears to
 be in harmony with the fact that the orders of the voltaic series at
 60° and 160° F. are not widely di<U+FB01>erent (see Table X, p. 260.              By
 similar tabular comparisons and reckonings, the electrical e<U+FB01>ect of
 heating the <U+FB01>rst electrode was found to be usually a little greater
 than that of heating the second one.
    The extremely negative poasition of magnesium in many thermo
 electric series, both with weak and strong solutions, does not appear to
 be explicable either by its strongly volta-positive character, its own
thermo-positive character amongst metals, or by the thermo-electric
 properties of the liquids, but requires the assumption of some other
 cause operating. The thermo-electric positions of several other metals,
 such as aluminium, nickel, and palladium, &c., in particular liquids,
 are also, though    in a less degree, inexplicable by these causes alone.
    Many of     the metals   in Table X (p. 260) were reversed in their
 order of position in the series by rise of temperature; the total num
 ber not reversed was 174, and of reversed 112, or 1‘55 to 1'0 = 6451"
per cent.     The reversals varied in number in different liquids; most
occurred with nitric and sulphuric acids and potassic cyanide (8 in
 each).   Every metal su<U+FB01>ered reversals; the number was greatest
 with aluminium (30) and       lead (23), and least with zinc and  nickel
 The metals which most frequently crossed each other were aluminium
 with lead and with iron, each seven times.          Reversals were less fre~
quently caused in chemico-electric series by a rise of temperature of
 100° F. than in a thermo-electric series by a difference of strength of
liquid, the proportion in the former case being 174 out of 286, and in
the latter 250 out of 286 (see p. 258).
   Regarding the effect of heating two different metals simultaneously
in the chemico-electric experiments (shown in Table X, p. 260), as
being chie<U+FB02>y composed of the two e<U+FB01>ects of heating the same metals
separately (as shown in the thermo-electric series of Table I),       I   have

           Thermo-electric Action     of Metals in Electrolytes.         271
compared the relative positions in Table X of, the metals which have
crossed each other by simultaneous heating to 160° F. with those of
the same metals in Table I, as determined by heating them separately
to that temperature in the same liquids.       I thus found that out of the
total 83 instances of crossing 72 are explicable in this manner, and
the remaining 9 are but feeble exceptions, both as regards their
relative positions in the chemico- and in the thermo-electric series,
and also as regards their relative degrees of electromotive force,
7 out of the 9 couples being composed         of noble metals, which give
relatively feeble currents.      No instance occurred in which the re
versal was produced by alteration of potential of one metal only;
32 happened in which it was due to one metal increasing and the
other decreasing in that power; 37 in which it was due to both
metals increasing simultaneously, but at different rates; and 5 in
which it was a result of simultaneous but unequal diminution of
potential in the two metals.     The di<U+FB01>erences of order of the chemico
electric series at 60° and 160° F. in Table X, and the coincident
reversals, are therefore results of the combined e<U+FB02>fect of heat upon
the two individual metals, as shown in Table I.           In the cases of re
versal, the number of instances in which a metal becomes positive by
rise of temperature was more than twice as great as those in which it
became negative; this agrees with the proportion of thermo-positive
and negative members in Table       I  (see pp. 253 and 254), and with the
statement that heat usually increases electro-positive activity.
   It is evident that as in certain cases a given metal is chemico
electro-positive at 60° to another metal, whilst at 160° F. it is negative,
it must at some intermediate temperature be neutral to it and pro
duce no current; the electric potentials of the two metals must at
that point be equal and opposite. A number of experiments were
therefore made in order to ascertain the temperatures of these neutral
points at which reversal took place.      The solutions employed were all
of them of the same composition as those used in determining the
chemico-electric series (p. 269).     The following are the results :—In

both metals diminished in potential were: Au and Pd in potassic sul
phate, also in oxalic acid; Fe and Sn in chloric acid; Au and Ag in
magnesic sulphate; and Pb and Al in potassic alum.                 As visible
chemical corrosion of metal is not necessary to thermo-electric action
of metals in liquids, reversals occurred with non-corroded, as well
as with corroded metals.
   Very slight circumstances altered the position of a chemico-electric
reversal point in the scale of temperature, and even caused it to pass
beyond the limits of the scale and of observation.                 A di<U+FB01>erent
sample of metal or of salt, and other circumstances, often produced
this effect; the results are therefore very variable.
    Out of the total 83 cases of reversal obtained by sudden immersion
of the pairs of metals, <U+FB01>rst at 60° and then at 160° F. (see Table X),
only 54 were reobtained on heating the metals gradually in the
liquids, and 11 of those so obtained occurred at temperatures higher
than those employed when the metals were suddenly heated.              Gradu
ally heating the metals appeared therefore to cause in some cases the
reversals either to disappear or to occur at a higher temperature (pro
bably in consequence partly of polarisation).           This e<U+FB01>ect was more
common      in  a solution  of potassic cyanide   than  in dilute sulphuric or
nitric  acids.
    It may   be observed also with regard to some of these cases that the
temperatures at which the reversals took place were usually lower the
weaker the electromotive force; this was the case with aluminium in
relation to cadmium, iron, tin, and lead in dilute sulphuric acid; also
with that metal in relation to cadmium, iron, and lead in nitric acid;
and less distinctly in solution of potassic alum and other liquids.
    The in<U+FB02>uence of heat upon the chemico-electric series of Table X
 was further examined by measuring the degrees of electric potential,
both at 60° and 160° F., of the extreme top and bottom metals in the
respective liquids of that table.      The results are given in Table XI.
    Remarks—In       12  cases the voltaic potential was increased, and in
 6 decreased; the total amount of increase was 5 times that of de
 crease, and the average proportion of increase for the 18 instances
 was '10 volt for 100° F. rise of temperature.            By comparing these

results also agree with the fact that heat usually increases electric
potential of metals in liquids. The in<U+FB02>uence of increase of tempera~

increased strength of liquid upon thermo-electric        potential (see

   As rise of temperature diminishes in certain cases the chemico
electric potential of a metal in an electrolyte (see Table XI, p. 273),
this fact may suggest the idea that when a metal is thermo-electro
negative in a particular liquid its degree of rapidity of corrosion is
lessened by rise of temperature.               This question was subsequently
investigated (see p. 285).
   By <U+FB01>rst comparing the orders of the chemico-electric series (Table X)
of metals in hot solutions of potassic bromide and chloride, side by side
with each other, and then those in hot solution of potassic cyanide
and dilute sulphuric acid, similarly, the in<U+FB02>uences of small and of
great di<U+FB01>erence of chemical composition of the liquid were con
spicuously seen. In the former case only four of the metals were
altered in position, whilst in the latter ten were displaced.              The
differences also between the orders of the series obtained with dilute
hydrochloric acid and solution of potassic chloride, each at 60° F.,
were much greater than between those obtained with that acid or
that salt at 60° and 160° F. A much greater effect was produced in
these cases'by a di<U+FB01>erence of liquid than by one of 100° F. of tem
perature.
   With the object of ascertaining the e<U+FB01>ect of increased strength of
liquid upon the order of the chemico-electric series of metals in elec
trolytes at 60° F., a similar set of experiments to those employed in
constructing Table X were made.               The strengths of solutions were
the same as those used in making the thermo-electric determinations
of Table        IV   (p. 259).

   Remarks.——The usual strength of the current obtained in this series
of experiments was but little greater than those obtained with the
weaker liquids at the same temperature.                     Silver was nearly always
the most volta-electro-negative metal in alkaline liquids, except in
potassic cyanide, whether they were strong or weak (see Tables X and
XIII). Copper was remarkably volta-positive, both in hot and cold
weak solution of potassic cyanide (see Table X), and in a strong
cold    one.

276         Dr. G. Gore.     Relations of Heat  to Voltaic and
    Difference of strength of solution, like difference of temperature,
altered the order of the series with nearly every liquid. In the same
total number of instances (286), the number of reversals of position
in the orders, in liquids of four or <U+FB01>ve times the strength, was 74,
whilst that produced by a difference of temperature of 100° F.
was 83; therefore the usual amounts of chemico-electric molecular
change produced in the metals and liquids by these two causes were
not widely different.    In twenty-nine cases the reversals produced by
increased strength of liquid, occurred with the same metals and
liquids as those produced by rise of temperature. Whilst also with the
286 members of the thermo-electric series in Table IV (see p. 260), a
variation of strength of liquid greatly altered the sequence, and
produced no less than 236 reversals, it caused only a moderate degree
of change of order, and only 74 reversals in the chemico-electric
series.     This conspicuous difference between e<U+FB02>‘ects of increased
strength of liquid upon the thermo- and chemico-electric series, is
perhaps explicable by the circumstance that a thermo-electric ecuple,
consisting of an unequally heated metal and electrolyte, behaves like
a feeble voltaic combination of two metals and two liquids, and is a
more complex arrangement than a voltaic element of two metals and
one liquid, such as was used in forming the above Table     XIII.
    The in<U+FB02>uence of strength of solution upon the electric potential
                                                  “     ”
of the extreme top and bottom members of the cold columns of the
chemico-electric series of Table X, was also examined by the method
of balance; the liquids employed being the same as those used in
ascertaining the in<U+FB02>uence of the same condition upon the order of the
thermo-electric series of Table IV (p. 259). All the solutions were
used at 60‘I F.    The results, placed side by side with those obtained
with the weaker liquids, are shown in Table XIV.
    Remarks—In twelve cases the electric potential was increased,
and in <U+FB01>ve decreased by increased strength of the solutions.         The
total amount of increase was 3‘55 times that of decrease, and the
average proportion of increase for the seventeen instances was '095
volt per 100° F. rise of temperature.      The results when compared
with those in Table XI, p. 273, show that the increased strength of
the liquid had about the same average degree of effect as a rise of
temperature of 100° F. in increasing the chemico-electric potential.
The in<U+FB02>uence of increased strength of liquid upon chemico-electric
potential was di<U+FB02>ierent from that upon thermo-electric potential, in
the former it was usually attended by an increase, and in the latter
by a decrease, see Tables VI, VII.
    The electric potential of a voltaic couple appears to be in certain
 cases decreased by rise of temperature (see Table XI, p. 273).     This
 circumstance is a consequence of the fact that by accession of heat
 many metals become electro-negative, and others electro-positive in

the volta-positive metal is thermo-negative, and the negative one is
thermo-positive, is heated, the electric potential tends to diminish,
notwithstanding that the internal resistance usually decreased.                                   The

278             Dr. G. Gore.             Relations        of Heat       to  Volfaic and
   The instances were               selected     because         they were conspicuous ones.
The results        are probably in some               cases       partly due to extremely thin
<U+FB01>lms of insoluble matter formed upon the metals (see pp. 255, 261,
270, 278); this assumption of the existence of <U+FB01>lms will not, however,
explain many of the cases in Tables I and IV, when non-corroded
metals were rendered negative by being heated.                                    Fifty-six cases of
relative diminution of volta-electric potential by rise of temperature
are included in the cases of reversal in Table X (see p. 266).
    Similar results to the above were arrived at by a more direct
method.         The chemico-electric potential of each pair of metals was
<U+FB01>rst determined (by the method of balance) at 60° and then at 160° F.,
by suddenly immersing the pair in the previously prepared liquid.
The following were the results :—

    Remarks—While each of these determinations except the last one
agrees with the former ones in being a case of decrease of electric
potential by equal rise of temperature, the amounts of decrease for
the corresponding pairs of metals differ very considerably in the two
tables, probably in consequence chie<U+FB02>y of the circumstance that in
 each of the experiments of the former determinations the metals in
mutual contact were the same, but at different temperatures, whilst
 in the latter they were dissimilar ones at the same temperature.
 When heating a voltaic pair, the heat is applied to two metals, both
of which are previously electro-polar by contact with each other, as
well as by contact with the liquid; but when heating one junction of
 a liquid and metal thermo-couple, the metal has not been previously
 rendered electro-polar by contact with a different one, and is there
 fore in a somewhat di<U+FB01>erent electric state.                           Faraday observed similar
 cases (“Experimental                    Researches,” 1923), viz., that by either
heating one or two pieces of silver or of platinum in a cold mixture of
 1 part of sulphuric acid and 80 of water, little or no electric current
was manifest, but on heating the silver or platinum alone of a voltaic
 pair of those metals in that liquid, in each case a current occurred.
 Heating the platinum made it strongly negative, and heating the
 silver made it weakly positive.                   These cases illustrate the necessity
 of considering the e<U+FB01>ect of voltaic contact, as well as that of chemico

current of two of those metals (contiguous or as near to each other
as could be obtained) in one of those liquids at atmospheric tempera
ture, was balanced by a thermo-electric one from two pieces of one of
the same metals in a second portion of the same liquid, in a bent

the balance occurred.                 Usually, however, the bent tube alone (as in
<U+FB01>g.   1,  p. 251,  but     provided with a hot water-bath), containing the two
metals, was used.                The temporary portion of current was in every
case allowed to subside before applying the heat.                                   Cases in which
the voltaic current from two contiguous metals was too strong to be
balanced by the only applicable thermo-electric one were excluded.
The electric potentials at 60° F. of most of the voltaic pairs employed
were subsequently determined.                     The following are the results :—

           Thermo-electric Action of Illetals in Electrolytes.      281
    Remrw-ks.—The thermo currents produced by solutions of potassic
carbonate and sodic phosphate were usually strong, and so also were
those with aluminium, tin, and iron, and yielded many balances;
whilst those from solutions of oxalic, formic, and tartaric acids were
too feeble to balance the corresponding voltaic ones.      In obtaining
balances with the noble metals, the voltaic currents were so very
small that the Thomson’s re<U+FB02>ecting galvanometer had to be employed;
these cases are indicated by an asterisk.
    By means of a separate experiment it was ascertained that the
 amount of error caused by the voltaic current producing polarisation
before the thermo current had time to balance it was small, even
in the cases where the former current was comparatively strong, as
with a solution of potassic cyanide.
    A  number of thermo-electric reversals occurred during the making
of these determinations : thus, in a solution of potassic nitrate, gold
was thermo-electro-positive below and negative above 200 F., and
platinum behaved similarly below and above 180°. Aluminium in
solution of potassic carbonate became less thermo-positive above
140° F.    Lead in sodic chloride and magnesium in potassic hydrate
was thermo-positive below 170° and negative above it.           In sodic
sulphate nickel was thermo-negative below 110° and positive above
that temperature. In dilute nitric acid lead was negative below and
positive above 180°, and tin similarly below and above 150°. In
dilute chloric acid iron was positive up to 150° and negative above it.
In potassic alum nickel was positive below and feebly negative above
 164° F.    In ammonic alum aluminium was negative below and
,positive above 150°, and nickel was positive below and negative
 above 170° F. In magnesic sulphate cadmium behaved singularly;
whilst it was chemico-negative to zinc and positive to aluminium at
 60° F., by heating it alone (the zinc being in the cold part of the
liquid) it became more negative, but with aluminium in the place of
 zinc, the cadmium became more positive by being heated. This expe
 riment was repeated and similar results obtained; it is probably a case
 of the kind mentioned on pp. 279 and 288.
    On comparing these reversals with the positions of the same
 metals in the same liquids in Table I, it will be observed that some of
 them do not agree in thermo-electric sign in the two cases. These
 apparent discrepancies may be partly accounted for by the circum
 stance that in the experiments of Table I, the metals were suddenly
 immersed in the hot and cold portions of liquid, whilst in the present
 ones they were immersed in the two cold portions, and one of them
 then gradually heated; they may also be partly explained by the
 circumstance observed that the balance obtained during a rising of
 temperature was frequently at a somewhat higher point than one
  obtained whilst the temperature was falling (compare also p. 272 for

282           Dr. G. Gore.                Relations      of IIeat      to Voltaic           and
e<U+FB02>ect upon reversal point by gradually heating the liquid). This
difference of effect during a rising and falling of temperature is
probably due to some hindrance to change of molecular movements
analogous to that of supersaturation of a liquid by a salt.
   A series of experiments were made to determine whether the
di<U+FB01>erence in potential, caused in a voltaic cell by rise of temperature,
is usually completely accounted for by the electromotive forces pro
duced by the same rise of temperature of the same metals separately
in the same liquids.                 The electric potentials in Table                     XVIII      of the
voltaic elements (A) at 60° F. (B) and 160° F. (C) were separately
ascertained by means of the thermo—piles (p. 257); and those of the
separate metals in the form of thermo-elements (D and E) as pro
duced bya difference of from 60° to 160° F. were also separately
determined in the same manner, and by the aid of the bent tube
apparatus, &c. (see pp. 251 and 257). The liquids employed were of
the same quality and strength as those mentioned on p. 252.                                               The
following table exhibits the results. The arrows represent the direc

             lern'zmelectric Action of Metals in Electrolytes.          283
     One of the objects of the research being to\ examine the relation of
  ordinary chemical corrosion to the thermo- and chemico-electric
  actions of metals in electrolytes, the rates of corrosion of as many as
  possible of the di<U+FB01>erent metals employed (see Table I, p. 253), wholly
  immersed in an equal number-of separate portions of the same liquid,
  were ascertained, with one liquid at a time, in order to compare the
  series thus arrived at with the orders of the same metals in the same
  liquid in the thermo- and chemico-eleetric series.
     In carrying out this object, obstacles arose which prevented com
 plete corrosion series being obtained to correspond with the thermo
 and chemico-electric ones.     In some cases the metals became covered
 with a <U+FB01>lm of gas, or with a solid coating, each of which altered the rate
 of corrosion; these cases were entirely rejected. In other cases the
 liquids contained traces of impurity which caused a solid <U+FB01>lm upon
 the metal; this was overcome by repeatedly immersing the metal in
 the liquid until the impurity was wholly removed, and then reim
 mersing it several times during longer periods, until concordant rates
 of corrosion were obtained. And in other instances the metal itself
 contained small amounts of impurity, which by exciting electric
 polarity, increased the corrosion.     In addition to these and other
 in<U+FB02>uences, the rate of corrosion must have been a<U+FB01>ected by the
 unequal degrees of adhesion of the soluble products of corrosion to
 the corroding surface, and the unequal rates of diffusion of those
 substances into the surrounding liquid ; these in<U+FB02>uences were reduced
 to a minimum by employing either very dilute solutions of the
 corroding agents, or such liquids as corroded but slowly.        All these
 circumstances    had  to be considered, and each    combination   of metal
and liquid treated in such a manner as to ensure the most attainably
accurate result; but even under the most carefully prepared condi
tions, rate of corrosion is a very variable phenomenon.
     With silver, palladium, gold, and platinum, it wasvnecessary to use
much larger sheets and stronger solutions, and to continue the expe
ments during a longer period.       The solutions of the two alums were
four times, and those of potassic cyanide, sulphuric, hydrochloric,
nitric, and chloric acids were of ten times, and the remainder of the
usual strength. The silver was immersed in dilute nitric and chloric
acids during one month and the other metals during three months.
Most of the liquids corroded silver very slightly, and the metal
acquired an adherent insoluble coating.       The rates of loss are given
in the table, but are separated from those in the weak liquids by
horizontal lines.
     The action was in no case allowed to continue longer than was
suf<U+FB01>cient to exhaust about 10 or 20 per cent. of the corroding
substance.     After excluding all doubtful cases, a suf<U+FB01>cient number
remained for the purposes intended.       The rates of loss by corrosion

     Remarks.—These series and numbers show, 1st, that the order of
 rapidity of corrosion di<U+FB01>ered with every different metal and in every
 different solution ; 2nd, the rates of corrosion of each metal varied in
 nearly every separate liquid; 3rd, in each solution also it differed
 with every different metal; 4th, the most chemically positive metals
 were usually the most quickly corroded; and 5th, the corrosion of
 metals was usually the fastest in the most acid liquids.                                            These results
 indicate that the rate of corrosion depends both upon the metal and
 upon the liquid, probably most upon the former.                                               With regard to
 the effect of chemical composition of the liquid, the differences of
 order between the series with a solution of potassic cyanide and with
     ’1'“This                   was found by analysis               to contain 8914

dilute sulphuric acid at 60°    F. were found to be greater than those
between the series    with  potassic bromide and chloride.
   Comparisons of the order of the corrosion series at 60° F., with the
thermo-electric ones of the same liquids of Table I (p. 253), and the
                                  cold columns in Table X (p. 265) show
                                “      ”
chemico-electric ones of the
that the order of simple corrosion di<U+FB01>ers largely from that of chemico
electric, and still more largely from that of thermo-electric action.
In no one pair of the twelve corresponding series of Tables X and
XVIII did the order of metals entirely agree, the least agreeing ones
were those in potassic cyanide and bromide.        The degree of chemico
or thermo-electric' potential therefore does not vary in the same
order as that of rapidity of simple corrosion in any of the liquids
examined.      These different degrees of relative divergence of order of
the  three  tables  indicate a greater degree of complexity of thermo
electric than of chemico-electric action of metals in liquids in the
given cases, and a less dependence of the former than of the latter
upon simple corrosion.        As real thermo-electric action of metals in
liquids   does   not  necessarily include corrosion, the latter when it
occurs with the former is not the cause of it.
    With regard to the relation of voltaic action to corrosion, Poggen
 dor<U+FB01>' published (“ Phil. Mag,” 1840, vol. xvi, pp. 495 and 537) a
number of experiments showing that the chemico-electromotive
force was not the strongest in those liquids where the corrosion of
the metal was apparently the most rapid, but he does not appear to
have actually veri<U+FB01>ed the relative losses of weight by weighing the
 metals; nor to have excluded from his tables those metals which
became coated with a <U+FB01>lm of insoluble matter.
    In order to ascertain whether rise of temperature caused every
metal to corrode faster, or had always the effect of making only
those metals corrode faster which by it were rendered more chemico
electro-positive, and those more slowly which were rendered negative,
series of corrosion experiments were made with most of the same
metals and liquids (see p. 252) at 160° F. as were employed in the
thermo-electric experiments of Table I, care been taken to keep the
metals wholly immersed, and the liquids from altering in strength by
evaporation.      The length of time during which it was necessary to
continue the experiment varied from <U+FB01>ve minutes to eight hours.
Table XX (p. 286), shows the rates of loss in grains per square inch
per hour. The proportionate rates of increase for 100° F. rise of
temperature, as calculated from the numbers on Table XIX, p. 284»,
are also given for comparison.
    Remarks—By comparing these results with those obtained at 60° F.,
as shown in Table XIX, p. 284, it will be seen that in nearly every
 case rise of temperature increased the rate of corrosion. The only
 exception in the total <U+FB01>fty-seven cases was zinc in dilute nitric acid,

and this was a very feeble one.                                      The increases of rate of corrosion
under          the      in<U+FB02>uence              of   heat    were        extremely variable, whilst that of
tin in dilute nitric acid was increased 1'5 times, that of copper in
hydrochloric acid was increased 3216 times; both these metals and
acids were very pure, and not a trace of oxide appeared upon the
tin.         The total average increase for the entire series was 29'98.                                                          The
changes produced in the orders of the series by di<U+FB01>crence of tempera
ture were least in dilute hydrochloric acid. The results contained
in Tables XIX and XX show that when metals are rendered
thermo-electro-negative                              in liquids by'being heated, their electric
change is not attended by diminished rapidity of corrosion.                                                                           It
 was found by comparing Table XIX with Table                                                            I that the propor
tion of cases in which the metal most corroded was more thermo
    * This        was the only case of decrease, and was veri<U+FB01>ed                                   by means        of a repetition
experiment.

            'leea-mo-electric Action  of Metals inyElectrolytes.       287
 positive or less negative to that in which it was less positive or more
 negative, was 384 to 199 (= 65'87 per cent), or as 1‘93 to 1 ; also by
 similarly comparing Table XX, that the proportion in which the
 metal most corroded at 160° F. was most positive or less negative to
 that in which it was the reverse, was 338 to 151 (= 6912 per cent),
 or as 2'24 to 1.
    And with regard to the relation of corrosion to voltaic state, it has
 been assumed “ that in all these cases the positive electricity sets out
 from the more oxidable metal, and traverses the liquid towards the
 less oxidable one ;” but comparisons of Tables X, XIX, and XX
.show that this is not entirely correct ; with twelve different liquids at
 60° F. the most chemico-electro-positive       metal was also the most
 corroded one in 337 cases, and the least corroded in 62=a proportion
 of 5'43 to 1, or 84144! per cent. ; and with seven liquids at 160° F. the
 numbers were respectively 2418 and 59 =a proportion of 4'20 to 1, or
 8077 per cent. Neither volta-positive nor negative state, therefore,
 is always proportionate to degree of ordinary corrosion, either in cold
 or hot liquids.   These <U+FB01>gures show also that by a rise of temperature
 of 100° F. the proportion of cases in which the negative metal was
 the most corroded, increased from 1556 to 1923 per cent. of the
 entire number of cases. Comparison of the above proportions with
 those of the relation of corrosion to the thermo-electric states of
 metals in liquids, viz., 1‘93 to 1 and 2'24 to 1 (see above), shows
 that corrosion usually in<U+FB02>uenced in a much greater degree the
 chemico- than the thermo-electric properties of such combinations.
    Not only was the relative number of cases in which the volta-nega-I
 tive metal was the most corroded increased by rise of temperature,
 but also the average relative loss by corrosion of the negative one to
 that of the positive was more than doubled.
    The following appear to be cases in which contact in<U+FB02>uenced the
thermo-electric currents of metals in liquids.     With each instance, in
the <U+FB01>rst part of the experiment the metal was suddenly immersed in
the hot liquid; and, in the second part, the same metal and liquid
were gradually heated.       In a solution of potassic bromide, copper
alone was thermo-positive, but when gradually heated in contact with
tin it was thermo-negative; in one of potassic nitrate platinum alone
was thermo-positive, but in contact with gold it was rendered slightly
more negative during a slight elevation only of temperature; in
potassic hydrate magnesium alone was thermo-negative, but in con
tact with lead it was rendered more positive by heat up to 170° F.;
in sodic sulphate nickel alone was thermo-positive, but in contact
with tin it was more negative up .to 110° F.; in dilute nitric acid
lead alone was thermo-positive, but in contact with iron it was more
negative up to 180° F.; in the same liquid tin alone was thermo
negative, but in contact with nickel it was more positive up to 160° F. g

  of Table XVII (p. 279), but were not included in that table because
   they did not yield balances.
     In each of these causes the electric e<U+FB02>'ect of heat upon the same
  metal in the same liquid was opposite to its usual thermo-electric one
  in that liquid.    In each case also its effect was to increase, within the
  limits of a moderate rise of temperature, the strength of the already
  existing voltaic current.      These changes may be explicable by sup
  posing   that  the  additional irregularities of electric potential intro
  duced by the second metal at its two points of contact with the liquid
  and original metal altered the electric condition of the subsequently
  heated metal.     The pre-existing voltaic currents also were so feeble
  that these unusual e<U+FB01>ects of heat do not appear to have been due to
  chemical changes of the liquid at the heated electrode; such changes,
  and the degrees of polarisation due to them, must also have been
  small in comparison with those already produced by ordinary chemical
  corrosion.
     In a separate communication “ On some Relations of Chemical
  Corrosion to Voltaic Currents,” “Proc. Roy. 800.,” vol. 36, p. 331,
  I have examined the amounts of external voltaic current produced by
  the corrosion of known weights of various metals at atmospheric
  temperature.
‘    The general conclusions drawn from the experiments described in
                                             “            “
  the present paper may be found in the Abstract,”          Proc. Roy. 300.,”
  vol. 36, p. 50.
     The fact that the mere contact of the metal and liquid of a thermo
  electric pair is attended by electric polarity, and that either heating
  the one junction or cooling the other of such a couple produces an
  electric current, may be regarded as evidence that at all times, whilst
  no heat or cold is being applied to either of these joinings, the mole
  cular actions at the two points of union tend to produce a current,
  but as these tendencies are opposite in direction and equal in strength,
  no current occurs. Each of these junctions may also be regarded as
  a surface of contact previously possessing a tendency to alter in tem
  perature, and this view is supported by the discovery of Pouillet, that
  even when non-corrodible metals touch liquids, a slight change of
  temperature occurs (“ Annal. de Chimie,” 1822, pp. 141—162).
     In support of this view, it may be observed that amongst the
  instances composing the chemico-electric series of Table X are many
  the currents of which are at the most of doubtful chemical origin. Of
  these, are the cases in which currents are produced by non-corroded
  metals, such as platinum, gold, palladium, and silver, in feebly
  corrosive liquids, including solutions of neutral salts.        A suitable

              Theme—electric   Action of Metals in Electrolytes.         289
  instance of this kind is silver and platinum in a strong solution of
  potassic <U+FB02>uoride. The electromotive force of this combination was
  found to be '0477 of a volt (see Table XII, p. 273).
      In order to test the inference “ that at all times, whilst no heat or
  cold is being applied to either of the junctions of the thermo-electric
  couple, the molecular actions at the two points of union tend to
  produce a current,”     I  suspended,  by means of a pure silver wire,
  a sheet of pure silver, 2% inches wide and 3 inches deep, between two
  sheets of platinum, 3 inches wide and 6 inches deep, in a glass cell,
  containing a solution of pure potassic hydrate, 10 grains per ounce of
  water, the platinum being immersed 4! inches, and the silver wholly,
  in the liquid, and the two metals united outside by the wire. At the
  outset, the platinum was positive to the silver, about 5° de<U+FB02>ection
  being produced of the needle of a galvanometer of 100 ohms resist
  ance, and after a few hours 1°, and permanently half a degree; it
  then remained constant at that point, as shown by occasional testing
  during about four months, when, by concentration of the liquid by eva
  poration, the current was feebly reversed.       After diluting the liquid
  to its original strength, the platinum was again positive half a degree,
  and continued so during a further period of one year.         In a similar
  previous experiment with smaller plates similar results were obtained.
      To ascertain whether the platinum was corroded, two electrodes—
   one of sheet silver and one of platinum— each about 1 inch wide and
  3 inches deep, were partly immersed in a similar solution of the
  hydrate, and a current from two Smee’s cells passed through the
  liquid, the platinum being the anode, during several weeks.            The
  plates were then reweighed; the platinum had not perceptibly dimi
                                                                       '
  nished in weight, and the silver had lost less than '01 grain.
      As an additional example, when gold and platinum produce an
  electric current in a solution of neutral potassic sulphate, gold being
  positive (see Table X, p. 266), the solution does not corrode them
   (see p. 283), and the current is therefore not due to chemical corrosion.
      In each of such cases there are three points of heterogeneous con
  tact :——1st. Where the liquid A touches the metal B ; 2nd. Where it
  touches the metal C; and 3rd. Where the metals B and C touch
  each other.      At each of these points the substances are rendered
  electro-polar by molecular action, and as a feeble current occurs the
  polarities thus produced do not balance each other. As also a less
  degree of electric potential is necessary to make a current pass
  through a suitable electrolyte than to cause a refractory metal such
  as gold or platinum to corrode, the current is produced without
  corrosion of metal.    This current at once begins to produce the usual
. e<U+FB02>’ect of raising obstacles to its own continuance, by causing polarisa
  tion at the electrodes, and becomes more feeble. As a portion of the
   current, however, continues permanently, producing the usual effect

upon a galvanometer needle, a permanent source of power must exist;
and as corrosion of metal does not occur, this source of, power must
be different from that of the voltaic current; such currents have been
attributed to capillary action.
“Report      to the Solar Physics Committee on a Comparison
      between apparent Inequalities of Short Period in Sun-spot
      Areas and in Diurnal Temperature-ranges at Toronto and
      Kew.” By BALFOUR STEWART, M.A., LL.D., F.R.S., and
      WILLIAM LANT CARPENTER, B.A., B.Sc. Communicated to
      the Royal Society at the request of the Solar Physics
      Committee. Received April 21. Read May 1, 1884.
   1. It has been known for some time, through        the researches of
Sabine and others, that there is a close connexion between the
Inequalities in the state of the sun's surface as denoted by sun-spot
areas and those in terrestrial magnetism as denoted by the diurnal
ranges of oscillation of the declination magnet; and moreover, the
observations of Baxendell, Meldrum, and various other meteorologists
have induced us to suspect that there may likewise be a connexion
between solar inequalities and those in terrestrial meteorology.
   This latter connexion, however, assuming it to exist, is not so well
established as the former—at least if we compare together Inequalities
of long period. Attempts have been made to explain this by ima
gining that for long periods the state of the atmosphere, as regards
absorption, may change in such a manner as to diminish or even
cloak the effects of solar variation by increasing the absorption when
the sun is strongest and diminishing the absorption when the sun is
weakest.
   On this account it has seemed to us desirable to make a comparison
of this kind between short-period Inequalities, since for these the
length of period could not so easily be deemed suf<U+FB01>cient to produce a
great alteration of the above nature in the state of the atmosphere.
   The meteorological element which we have selected for comparison
with sun-spots has been the diurnal range of atmospheric tempera
ture—an element which presents in its variations a very strong
analogy to diurnal declination-range.
   2. There are two ways in which a comparison might be made between
solar and terrestrial Inequalities.    We might take each individual
variation in sun-spot areas and <U+FB01>nd the value of the terrestrial
element corresponding in time to the maximum and the minimum
of the solar wave.     If we were to perform this operation for every
individual solar Inequality and add together the results, we might

                Sun-spot Areas and        Diurnal Temperature-Ranges.              291
  perhaps <U+FB01>nd that the magnetic declination-range was largest when
  there were most sun-spots.‘ If, however, we were to make a similar
  comparison between sun-spot daily areas, that is to say, the daily
  aggregate areas occupied by spots including penumbree, and diurnal
  temperature-ranges, we might not obtain a decisive result.                     For at
  certain stations such as Toronto, it is suspected (the veri<U+FB01>cation or
  disproval of this suspicion being one of the objects of this paper)
  that there are two maxima and two minima of temperature-range for
  one of sun-spots.           This is not a phenomenon unknown in other
  branches of meteorology, as for instance in barometric pressure, which
  has two oscillations in one day.             Its effect, however, might be such
 that, in a comparison made as above, the temperature-range corre
 sponding to a maximum of sun-spots might be equal in value to that
 corresponding to a minimum, or, in other words, we should get no
 apparent result, while, however, by some di<U+FB02>'erent process, proofs
 of a real connexion might be obtained.
     But if we can get evidences of apparent periodicity in sun-spot
 <U+FB02>uctuations when dealt with in a particular manner, we have a
method which will afford us a de<U+FB01>nite means of comparison. And
 here, as Professor Stokes has pointed out, it is not necessary for our
 present purpose to discuss the question whether these sun-spot
 Inequalities have a 'real or only an apparent periodicity.*                  All that
is needful is to treat the terrestrial phenomena in a similar manner,
 or in a manner as nearly similar as our observations will allow, and
 then see whether they likewise exhibit periodicities (apparent or
 real) having virtually the same times as those of the sun-spots—the
phases of the two sets of phenomena being likewise allied in a con
 stant manner. It is such a comparison that we have here made, but
 before describing the results obtained, it will <U+FB01>rst be necessary to
 describe the method of analysis which we have adopted.
                                    Method of Analysis.
     3.    Our method is      one  which enables     us to detect the existence of
unknown          Inequalities     having    apparent     periodicity  in  a mass     of
    *I‘ It is well known that when we discuss a series of <U+FB01>gures, we frequently detect
peculiarities of some kind, which strike the eye but have no scienti<U+FB01>c meaning.
Such peculiarities might occasionally assume the form of apparent periodicities, and
there is no reason why they should not manifest themselves when the <U+FB01>gures we are
discussing represent the progress of some natural phenomenon.         Moreover, in this
last case we may sometimes perceive irregular attempts at repetition, such as we
observe in volcanic    phenomena, to which, however, we are unable to assign any true
periodicity.      Now it is imaginable that such appearances as we have indicated above
may take place in our list of sun-spot areas without implying the presence of true
periodicity ; but whether such marks of periodicity as those records present be real
or only apparent, inasmuch as they do occur we should expect them likewise to occur
in such terrestrial phenomena as are closely connected with sun-spots.

observations.   A description of this method has already             been
          in the “ Proceedings of the Royal Society,” May 15,       1879,
published
but in order to render what follows more clear, we shall to          some
extent reproduce this description.
   Imagine, by way of illustration, that we have in our possession a
long series of temperatures of the earth’s atmosphere at some place in
middle latitudes, and that, independently          of our astronomical
knowledge, we were to make use of these for the purpose of investi
gating the natural Inequalities of terrestrial temperature.   We should
begin by grouping    the  observations    according  to various  periods
taken, say, at small but de<U+FB01>nite time-intervals from each other.
 Now, if our series of observations were suf<U+FB01>ciently extensive, and if
 some one of our various groupings together of this series should
 correspond to a real Inequality, we should expect it to exhibit
a well-de<U+FB01>ned and prominent <U+FB02>uctuation, whose departure           above
and below the mean should be of considerable amount.        Suppose, for
instance, that we have 24 places in our series, that is to say, we
proceed to group our mass of temperature observations in rows of
24 each, and suppose further that the time-interval between two con
tiguous members of one row is exactly one hour.              The series
would thus represent    the  mean   solar   day, and  we  should,  with
out doubt, obtain from a <U+FB01>nal summation and average of our rows,        :1.
result  exhibiting a prominent temperature <U+FB02>uctuation of a well
de<U+FB01>ned    character, which we might measure (as long as we kept to
24 points) by simply adding together all the departures of its various
points from the mean, whether these points be above or below; in
<U+FB01>ne, by obtaining the area of the curve which         is   the graphical
representation of the Inequality  above  and  below  the line of abseissze
taken to represent the mean of all the points.
   4,. Suppose next that, still keeping to rows of 24 places, we should
make the time-interval between two contiguous members of a row
somewhat di<U+FB01>erent from one hour, whether greater or less, we should
now in either case obtain a result exhibiting, when measured as
above, a much smaller Inequality than that given when the interval
was exactly one hour; and    it   iseven possible that  if   our series of
observations were suf<U+FB01>ciently extensive we should obtain hardly any
traces of an Inequality whatever.     In <U+FB01>ne, when each row accurately
represented a solar day, the result would be an Inequality of large
amount, but when each row represented      a  period either slightly less
or greater than a day, the result would be an Inequality of small
amount.
   This process as far as we have described it   isnot new, having been
already   used by Baxendell  and probably by   other  observers of stellar
variability.   In the present instance we should by its means, after
bestowing enormous labour in variously grouping in accordance with

            Sun-spot Areas and    Diurnal Temperature-Ranges.          293
a great number of periods taken at small intervals from        each other,
obtain at length an accurate value of the mean solar day.
   5. Re<U+FB02>ection will, however, convince us that it is possible greatly
to abridge this labour.     Let us still keep to our illustration of tem
perature observations but, since ignorance regarding the length of
the day is inconceivable, let us imagine that a staff of observers have
strict orders to register the temperature at every exact hour of a
mean time clock.      Let us further suppose that the rate of this clock is
constant but not quite correct, and that the observations so made
extend over a series of years.        It is required by means of these
observations to determine the clock-rate.
   To do this we might, if we chose, laboriously arrange the whole
body of observations in a number of different groups, one group
representing 24 hours by the clock, and other groups a little more or
a little less.  Amongst these some one grouping would be found to
exhibit when the summations were made a maximum amount of
<U+FB02>uctuation, and we should naturally imagine that the time-scale of
this grouping was the best representative of the mean solar day.
   We might, however, obtain the same result with in<U+FB01>nitely less
labour, and for this purpose we need not make any other fundamental
grouping than that which denotes 24 clock hours.
   Let us then arrange these observations in yearly series and <U+FB01>nd the
average Inequality for each year.
   Now suppose that for the <U+FB01>rst year the mean maximum diurnal
temperature occurred at 2 P.M. clock time, for the second year at
1 P.M., for the third year at noon, and so on, retiring backwards one
hour every year.      We should, of course, conclude that the clock went
one hour slow every year, and should thus obtain at once the clock
rate. And by pushing the second year’s Inequality one place forward,
the third year’s two places forward, and so on, adding together the
series so placed, and ultimately taking the mean, we should obtain
a good value of the true temperature Inequality corresponding to the
exact mean solar day.
   We have chosen a very obvious instance, but of course the clock
error in one year might not be exactly one hour, and it might be
necessary to arrange the yearly series in a number of different ways
with regard to each other before we obtained the grouping which
gave us the maximum Inequality.         But at length this result would
be obtained and without the expenditure of more than a moderate
amount of labour, and when obtained the time-scale belonging to it
would represent the mean solar day.
   It is virtually this method which we have employed in our present
investigation, and we shall now state what observations, solar and
terrestrial, we have at our disposal, and also how we have applied our
method to these observations.

294        vProf. Balfour Stewart and Mr.       W. L. Carpenter.
                 Sun-spot Observations and their Treatment.
   6.  We have begun by taking daily values of sun-spot areas com
mencing with Schwabe’s observations, which have been reduced by
Messrs. De La Rue, Stewart, and Loewy. These reduced records
giving total areas for individual days will be found in an Appendix to
the Report of the Solar Physics Committee.               They extend from
1832, the date when Schwabe appears to have matured his system of
observation, to 1853 inclusive.     From 1854 to 1860 inclusive, we have
made use of Carrington’s accurate observations; for 1961 we have had
to fall back once more upon Schwabe; while from 1862 to 1867 in
clusive we have the Kew series of observations.
   These various series form, when put together, one whole series of
36 years.     In many cases, owing to bad weather, there are gaps or
blanks between observations which we have <U+FB01>lled up by the simplest
possible form of interpolation.       These 36 years’ observations, when
the blanks have been <U+FB01>lled up, give us therefore one long series of
more or loss trustworthy daily records of the total area of spots on
the sun’s visible disk, the unit of measurement being the one
millionth of the sun’s visible hemisphere.
   7. Let us now in the <U+FB01>rst place group together these sun-spot
observations in rows of 24 days each, dividing the whole body of
observations so tabulated into 36 yearly series.        A year will contain
generally 15, but occasionally 16 lines of' 24 places each, that is to
say, it will consist of 15, or sometimes 16, horizontal rows, the number
of places in each horizontal row being always 24. The sums of each
of the 24 vertical columns for each year are now taken. We have
thus for each year a series of 24 sums.        But it is obvious that these
sums will be greater in years of maximum than in years of minimum
sun-spots, so that to use them as they stand would virtually mean to
give great weight to years of maximum as compared with years of
 minimum sun-spots in our search for Inequalities.              We have en.
deavoured to overcome this dif<U+FB01>culty in the following manner.               If
sun-spot    observations be  put into  a graphical  form,  it will at once be
seen that whenever the total sun-spot area is great, the oscillations
 of this, or ranges of sun-spot Inequalities, are great also, and that
these ranges may, as a <U+FB01>rst approximation at least, be deemed
 proportional to the general sun-spot activity.         In other words, the
 oscillations of areas are nearly proportional     to  the  areas.  We have,
 therefore, taken the above-mentioned 24 numbers for every year, and
 proportionally altered them so that the sum of the 241 shall for each
 year be equal to 24,000.      Each sum for each year should, therefore,
 be equal to 1000, provided it be not subject to the in<U+FB02>uence of some
 Inequality.

            San-spot Areas and    Diurnal  Temperature-Ranges.         295
  If,  however, there be a 24-day Inequality, some of these values will
be  larger and others smaller than 1000, and it is their diEerences
from 1000 that we <U+FB01>nally record with plus and minus signs in order
to form our yearly series.     It is, however, necessary here to remark
that in certain minimum years the observations which exhibit sun
spots are sometimes too unfrequent to render the year tabulated as
above in rows of 24 a trustworthy representative of the Inequalities
we are in search of.     In such cases we have taken in addition half a
year on each side of the minimum year, so that we have thus the
mean of two years instead of one, the central point of the series being,
however, as before, the middle of the minimum year. This treatment
has been applied to the years 1833, 1844, 1855, and 1856.
   The course of procedure described above may, we think, be justi<U+FB01>ed
by the following considerations :—                                       .
   We are engaged     in  applying to the sun-spot records a method of
analysis unquestionably founded on repetition.       We are, therefore, in
as far as our analysis is concerned, trying to <U+FB01>nd if there is repetition
in solar records, that is to say, trying to discover if they are possessed
of periodicity, whether apparent or real. Then the question arises
how to prevent years of many sun-spots from dominating in our
results to the exclusion of years of few spots. Now it is nearly certain
that, assuming a connexion between the state of the sun and
variations in terrestrial meteorology, sun-spots are only a celestial
 symptom of a certain variable state of the sun’s surface, perhaps of a
state of variable power, which is the true cause of terrestrial
variability. That is to say, it is highly probable that spots are not
themselves the causes of these terrestrial changes, and it is quite
certain that the e<U+FB01>cient (in contradistinction to the apparent sun;
spot) variation in the state of the sun, whatever it be, will not be
found to present ranges so great as those presented by sun-spots ; for
instance, spots may be entirely absent from the sun’s surface, and yet
the sun will cause diurnal variations in magnetism and meteorology
 of large amount.       An e<U+FB01>cient in contradistinction to a sun-spot
 oscillation of short period (presuming this to exist), may perhaps
 vary in magnitude from times of maximum to times of minimum sun
 spots—of this we are ignorant—all that we know is that the
 variation in magnitude of this ef<U+FB01>cient oscillation is doubtless less than
'that of the sun-spots which indicate it. The ef<U+FB01>cient oscillation may
 possibly be represented by a periodic function of short periodicity
 having a coef<U+FB01>cient which varies from times of maximum to times of
 minimum sun-spots. But if so we are at present concerned only with
 the short period function, and we can see no other way of obtaining
 this than by assigning what we imagine to be an average value to the
 coef<U+FB01>cient of the indicating sun-spot variation so as to give all years
 an equal weight. This is virtually what we have done in our

296        Prof. Balfour Stewart and Mr. W.          L. Carpenter.
treatment of sun-spots as above described, and we have adopted a
similar plan with our terrestrial records.
    8. Thus at length by the means new described we obtain 36
yearly series corresponding to the years from 1832 to 1867 inclusive,
each series containing positive and negative quantities whose sums are
exactly- equal.     Let us represent these as follows :—
               0).      (2)..  (3)..     -     -     .     (20..
               (1)..    (2)..  (3)..     -     -     -     (20..
               (1)..    (2).. k3)...      '-   '-     1    (24)..
    Now if we allow these terms to stand as above and take the sums of
the various vertical columns, we shall obtain a result denoting (when
 divided by 36) the <U+FB01>nal Inequality corresponding                 to 24 days
 exactly   as  well  as  this can  be  represented by    the  whole   body of
observations at our disposal. Suppose, however, we arrange the
horizontal lines in such a manner that (24.)33 comes under (23)”, and
 (1)34 under (24)33, and so on.      If we then sum up the vertical lines
 so arranged, the result will now represent an Inequality having a
 period so much longer than 24. days, that the difference amounts to
 one day in the course of a year.      This period will easily be found by
 the following proportion.         If in 36525 days things advance 1
 day, how much will they advance             in 24 days?       The result is
    24
         =0'0657, and hence the period of the Inequality           in question
 36525
 will  be 240657 days.      In the above example things have been pushed
 each year one place backwards, that is to say, from right to left ; had
 they been pushed one place forwards this would have denoted an
 Inequality   as much less in period than 24. days, as the one we have
 now considered is greater, in other words, one with a period of
 23'9343   days.    So in like manner two or three places backwards each
  year will denote Inequalities with periods of 24'1314 and 241971
 days, and two or three places forwards inequalities with periods of
 238686 and 238029 days and so on.               Here the law is su<U+FB02>iciently
 obvious.     The comparative magnitude of the <U+FB01>nal Inequality so
 obtained may be found by simply adding together all its 24 terms
 without respect of sign, the sum representing the total area of
 departure from the mean, which the Inequality would have exhibited
 had it been put into a graphical form.
     9. To obtain the proper phase of the Inequality let us arrange
 our series of individual observations so that the <U+FB01>rst begins with
  January 1, 1832, and let us suppose, for instance, that we are dealing

            Sun-spot Areas and     Diurnal Temperature-Ranges.                 297
 with an Inequality which exceeds the 24-day period by six days in one
 year.    Our object is to represent this and all other Inequalities with
 the phase they have in the beginning of 1832, that is to say, to
 represent each by a row of 24 <U+FB01>gures (plus and minus), the <U+FB01>rst of
 which denotes the phase on January 1, 1832.              Now, since the parti
 cular Inequality    in question is larger    in period than 24 days, corre
 sponding phases will gradually advance to the right, and hence the
 mean phase for 1832, which is denoted by the true phase for July 1 of
 that year, will be three (i.c., one-half of six) divisions to the right as
regards the phase for January 1. Hence it will be necessary, in
order to represent this Inequality as it was on January 1, 1832, to
push the 1832 series three places to the left, and then each successive
yearly series six places to the left of the one before it. The method
of setting for a difference representing an exact number of days in
each year is thus obvious.
    It is equally easy to set for differences representing not only whole
days, but also fractional parts of days.              For instance, let it be
required to set for an Inequality greater than 24 days by 3'75 days
each year.     Bearing in mind from what we have said that the mean
of   1832 is       days wrong,'_we  have as follows :—
             “DZ—Z}?
                                   Phase has gone       Phase has to be pulled
                Year.                 to right.    to left (nearest whole number).
                1832    ..........     1 '875    ......      . .   2
                1833    .........      5 '625       .......     .  6
                1834    ..........     9 '375    ..........        9
                1835    ..........   13 “125     .........        13
                1836    ..........   16 ‘875-    .........        17
                         and so on.                        and so on.
   10. Having thus explained our principle of setting we shall now
brie<U+FB02>y describe the practice which it has been found most convenient
to adopt. The whole number of yearly series is regarded as being
made up of three sets of 12 years each, namely, 1832—43, 1844-55,
1856—67, and Inequalities are obtained representing 1, 2, 3, 4, &c.,
days’ diiference plus or minus in 12 years. Thus 24_39 or simply
—39 represents, according to our notation, an Inequality whose
period falls short of 24 days by 39 days in 12 years, and so on.
   It has not been deemed necessary to make separate and complete
settings for each of the small stages indicated above, but only for
every third. Thus, for instance, we should make separate and com
plete settings for ~42, —39, —36, &c., obtaining in each case three
partial sums of 12 years each, the sum of which would represent the
<U+FB01>nal Inequality.- But with regard to the Inequality —41 we should
esteem it suf<U+FB01>ciently accurate if the <U+FB01>rst set of 12 years for —42 be

298        Prof. Balfour Stewart and Mr. \V. L. Carpenter.
kept as it is—the second set be pushed to the left of the <U+FB01>rst one
division, and the third to the left of the second one division—the
sum of the three 12-yearly series so placed being taken to repre
sent —41.        In like manner for —43 we should push the second
12-yearly series of —42 one division to the right of the <U+FB01>rst, and
the third one division to the right of the second.
                             l;
   The method which we have now described applies both to the
Inequalities around 24 days of which we have spoken, and to those
around 26 days which we are also about to exhibit.       Here, however,
one day   in  a year means          or '0712 day.  In other respects  the
                             365'25
treatment is the same for both.
           Temperalure-nmge Observations and their Treatment.
   11. We    are indebted to the Meteorological Council, the Kew Com
mittee,   and   to Messrs. Kingston and Carpmael, the late and the
present Directors of the Toronto Observatory, for 36 years of the
Diurnal Temperature-ranges at Toronto, extending from the begin
ning of 1844 to the end of 1879.      We have also obtained 24 years of l
the Diurnal Temperature-ranges        at  Kew, extending from 1856 to
1879, for which we are indebted to the Kew Committee.              These
observations have been split up into series of 12 years each, the
<U+FB01>rst two series of Toronto and the last series of Kew being coter
minous with solar series, the last series of Toronto and the last of
Kew being, however, 12 years later than the last solar series.
   It thus appears that a different series of years is represented in
each case.     It would, of course, have been better for our purpose if
precisely the same series of years had been represented by the three
sets of observations; but as this is not the case we have not scrupled
to make the comparison implied in this research between the whole
body of observations as they stand, believing that in so doing we
shall make the best use of the materials placed at our disposal.
   12. Here it will be necessary to allude to a method of treatment
which we have thought it desirable to apply to the temperature-range
observations, but which we have not found it necessary to apply to
those of sun-spots.
   Having obtained the yearly Inequalities corresponding to 24 days
in exactly the manner already described, we have to some extent
smoothed or equalised our series of di<U+FB01>erences.      The primary series
(A) has been converted into another series (B), also of 24 sums, each
sum of (B) being the mean of four consecutive sums of (A), and the
series  (B)  has been converted by a similar process into a series   (C),
each sum of     which is the mean of four consecutive sums of           It
is the series (C) which is ultimately made use of.

              Sun-spot Areas and      Diurnal Temperature-Ranges.           299
      The temperature-range Inequalities around 26 days have been dealt
   with in  a similar manner, except that (B) is a mean of 3 not 41 sums
   of (A), and (C) a mean of 3 not 4 sums of                Here, too, it is the
   series (C) which is ultimately used.
      13. These smoothed series have then been treated exactly after the
   manner in which we have treated the sun-spot series, and with them
   too the <U+FB01>rst term of each Inequality represents the phase of that
   Inequality which would have corresponded to January 1, 1832,
   provided the terrestrial records had extended back to that date.
   Thus the phases of the celestial and terrestrial Inequalities both
  start from the same epoch, and are in this respect strictly comparable
_
  with one another.
                         Limits of Accuracy of this Method.
      14. It is obvious that the method now described can only be con
   sidered as correct for periods not far removed on either side from that
   for which the series was originally framed.          Thus in the case of
   24 days it is apparent that 12 places pushed backwards every year
  would imply the same setting as 12 places pushed forwards, and also
  for 26 days 13 places pushed backwards each year would yield the
  same result as 13 places pushed forwards; it will not, therefore, do
  to extend the method nearly so far. It is imagined that four days a
  year on each side will form a legitimate boundary, or, adopting the
  notation of Art. 10, that the region between the limits ~48 and +48
  will not be seriously open to objection.          Considering it, however,
  desirable that this point should be veri<U+FB01>ed by some kind of actual
  trial, we have adopted the results deduced from a series of observa
  tions of Diurnal Declination-ranges at Kew excluding disturbances
  (“ Proc. Roy. Soc.,” May 15, 1879). These observations extend from
  1858 to 1873 inclusive, forming a series of 16 years, and they have
 been arranged as follows :—
     a.  In yearly    series   representing  24: days in length,    beginning
  January    1, 1858.
     p.  In yearly    series representing   24'25 days  in length, beginning
 January     1, 1858.
     Both of    these series have been treated according to the method
 described above, and settings have been made at distances denoting
 half a' day in a year, and extended on each side to lengths which
are probably beyond the limits of safety. The magnitudes of the
Inequalities represented by the various settings have been obtained
by summing up the positive and negative departures, and the results
are exhibited graphically in the following diagram in which abscissae
represent periods, while the ordinates represent corresponding In
equalities.

   It will at once be seen by comparing <U+FB01>gs. and         I        II  that they both
 exhibit very nearly the same positions for maximum Inequalities.
Towards the right, however, there are indications that the limits of
safety have been exceeded.        But there seems reason to suppose that
we shall be safe within the limits which we have set for ourselves,
and which correspond to about a quarter of a day on either side of
the normal.
   Our next point is to ascertain how far the phase of a prominent
Inequality, as, for instance, that near 24 days determined by the one
series, agrees with the same as determined by the other.                 It will, we
think, be seen from the following table, as well as from its graphical
representation which accompanies it, that there is a fairly good
agreement in phase between the two values of the Inequality so
determined.

          Results of Comparison of Inequalities around  241 Days.
    15. Comparison in Length of Period—The comparative magnitudes
 of the various solar Inequalities, whether apparent or real, are, as we
 have already explained, estimated by adding together the various
 yearly results appropriately placed, and then in the <U+FB01>nal Inequality
 so obtained by summing up the various departures whether positive
 or negative. The result for sun-spots is given in the form of a sum
 consisting of four or <U+FB01>ve places.   Of these we may to save space and
 time dismiss the two right hand <U+FB01>gures, that is to say, divide by 100,
while yet retaining a result suf<U+FB01>ciently accurate for the purposes of
our comparison. We have made this reduction in the following table
not merely for sun-spots, but likewise for temperature-ranges.     It has
to be remembered that for sun-spots and Toronto temperature-ranges
the results exhibit the sum of 36 years, while for Kew temperature
ranges they only exhibit the sum of 241 years.   The Kew temperature
ranges are esteemed by us to be of subordinate value, partly because
they consist of a smaller number of years, and partly because they
have only 12 years in common with sun-spots, and they have been
here introduced for a reason that will afterwards appear. Meanwhile
in our comparison as to length of period we con<U+FB01>ne ourselves to sun
spots and Toronto temperature-ranges, inasmuch as each of these
series embodies 36 years, of which 24 years are common to both.
   In the following table we have inclosed in brackets the positions of
all su<U+FB02>icieutly well-de<U+FB01>ned maximum Inequalities, whether of sun
spots or Toronto temperature-ranges.      We have likewise given a list
of the  Kew   temperature-range Inequalities, but for the reason already
mentioned we have not used these for the purpose of comparison, and
have not inclosed their maximum points in brackets.

Inequality Ior sun-spots are near those for Toronto temperature-ranges.
While this likeness cannot    be considered as conclusively proving a
connexion, it is nevertheless the sort of similarity which might be
expected to exist between phenomena physically connected, but con
taining so many apparent Inequalities, and these so near together that
our series of observations is not suf<U+FB01>ciently extensive to enable us to
eliminate their in<U+FB02>uence upon each other, or to allow us to ascertain
their true positions.

   16. Constancy of Type in the various Inequalities—It will be seen
from Table          III
                 that as a rule the sun-spot Inequalities contain one
maximum and one minimum in 24 days, and that as a rule the K63"
temperature-range Inequalities contain likewise one maximum and
one minimum<U+FB02>‘ while, however, the Toronto temperature-range In
    ‘I‘
      The numbers in this table represent the aggregate Inequalities for 36 years in
the sun-spot and Toronto temperature-range, and for 24 years in the Kew tempera
ture-range, after dividing by 100. Thus the SS Inequality for —-48 is in reality
9386, while the TT and KT are 2744 and 6060.
      At any rate the Kew Inequalities much more nearly represent a single than
    'I'
a   double oscillation.

            Sun-spot Areas and   Diurnal   Temperature-Ranges.        303
 equalities contain distinctly two maxima and two minima.       There are
 doubtless solitary exceptions where the two former Inequalities exhibit
two oscillations, and the latter an approach to a single oscillation only,
 but these are exceptions, and may we think fairly be supposed to be
 caused by the presence of some irregularity which we have not been
 able to eliminate.    We consider this constancy of type to be favour
 able to the view of a physical connexion between these phenomena.
 The argument may, perhaps, be put in this way. We are not entitled
 to expect in all cases terrestrial periods of one maximum and one
 minimum to correspond with solar periods of one maximum and one
 minimum, inasmuch as in another instance, namely, that of atmospheric
 pressure, we have two maxima and two minima more or less distinct
for one solar day. But we are entitled to expect, on the supposition
 that there is a physical connexion between the phenomena we are
 investigating, that they should exhibit a constancy of type. This
 constancy is, therefore, a thing which we might expect on the sup
 position of a connexion, but a thing unlikely to occur on the sup
 position that there is no true connexion between these various
 Inequalities.
    17. O'omparisou in Phase. —Not only might we expect on the hypo
thesis of a physical connexion between them that there should be a
constancy of type in these various phenomena, but we are further
more entitled to look for a de<U+FB01>nite relation in phase between the
corresponding celestial and terrestrial Inequalities.
   A comparison in phase seems calculated to afford better evidence of
a connexion than a comparison in length of period. Referring for
example to Table II, we <U+FB01>nd a well-marked maximum Inequality
which occurs at + 19 for sun-spots, and +20 for Toronto temperature
ranges. Had there been no other maximum than this, and had the
sums rapidly fallen o<U+FB01> on either side of this point, we should naturally
have imagined that this nearness was a strong proof of a physical
connexion, but there are evidently several apparent Inequalities, and
these are somewhat close together.
   Thus while there is a certain kind of evidence in the fact that for
each sun-spot maximum Inequality we have a Toronto temperature
range Inequality not far distant, yet this evidence is rather derived
from the circumstance that for each solar there is a terrestrial
maximum        than from the circumstance that these occur close
together; for if there be a su<U+FB02>icient number of such couplets they
must occur     close together.
    It thus appears that viewed in this way the evidence of a connexion
derived from nearness of period becomes the less striking the greater
the number of periods. The truth is that if there were only a single
Inequality in each record a comparatively short series would enable
us to detect      a connexion, but if there are many Inequalities    close

30}          Prof. Balfour Stewart and Mr. W.     L. Carpenter.
together, and    if,moreover, not only the years of the series but also
the type of the Inequality be different in the two records, we should
require a much longer series before we could so disentangle the
in<U+FB02>uence of Inequalities upon each other as to point by this means
unmistakably to physical connexion.
                     a
    The case   is di<U+FB02>'erent, however, in a comparison of phase.         If we
are able to show       a nearly de<U+FB01>nite relation in phase between each
couplet of these associated phenomena, then the greater the number
of such couplets the greater will be the evidence.        Were there only  a
single   Inequality   we  could  have  no  evidence  whatever   of this kind,
but     ifthere be a good number of Inequalities in each couplet of
which there     isa constant relation in phase between the two members,
the evidence of a connexion becomes very strong, because                   the
likelihood that such relation should constantly repeat itself without
                           a
a physical connexion       isextremely small. Again, as a matter of fact,
       much more easy to alter slightly the position of a maximum than
    is is
it it                                                      We have already
       sensibly to affect the phase of the Inequality.
mentioned     in Art.  10  that we  have only deemed it   necessary to make
separate and complete settings for every third of the small stages
herein employed. Now suppose that by such treatment we have                a
maximum at some point, say, for instance, —-36. By employing the
more laborious method of a complete setting for each small stage
we might in some cases shift the position of such a maximum (if
only slightly in excess of its neighbours) one or even two places, say
to —37 or —38, but we should not bysthis method of treatment
materially alter the phase.       In <U+FB01>ne, the comparison by periods is sub
 ject to greater uncertainty than the comparison by phases, inasmuch
 as while the maximum has been displaced by a slight di<U+FB01>'erence
 of treatment, through two divisions, the phases for —36, —37, —38
 by the old method are practically the same as those by the new. We
 have already (Art.        9)su<U+FB02>ieiently indicated the method of dealing
 with an Inequality of one period so as to bring          it  to represent in
 phase one of a slightly di<U+FB01>erent period.           In the above instance,
 therefore, we may imagine the true period of the Inequality to be
  —-36, or we may with equal propriety imagine         it     to be —38; in
 either case we shall have the same phase for our Inequality,
 provided that in the latter we reduce —38 so as to represent in
 phase the period —36, or, in <U+FB01>ne, bring both to one common
 period.
     It thus becomes manifest what we ought to do. We ought to
 reduce in phase the two members of a couplet to the same time-scale
  and then make our comparison.           It
                                          is    possible that if the series of
  years had been precisely the same for the celestial and the terrestrial
  members of the couplet, and if both had presented only one oscillation
  in 24 days, we might have found a constancy of phase between

               Sun-spot Areas and   Diurnal Temperature-Ranges.         305
    couplets of similar period even if these might be remote from a
    position of maximum Inequality.        But as it is we must con<U+FB01>ne
    ourselves to positions near some maximum in making our compari
    sons, and inasmuch as the Toronto temperature-range Inequalities
    presenting two <U+FB02>uctuations in 241 days are virtually short period
    Inequalities, we have preferred to take the positions of maximum
    Inequality from them rather than from the sun-spot records.
        Thus, for instance, referring once more to Table II, we <U+FB01>nd a
    Toronto maximum at —33, and a sun-spot maximum at —30. We
    have chosen —-33 as our period, and have altered the solar maximum
   at —30 in phase so as to make it indicate ~33, and so on with other
   couplets.
        Furthermore, in each case we take the mean of three series.    Thus
   in the instance now recorded we have taken the mean of sun-spots at
    —29, —30, and —31 all reduced to ~33, and have compared with
   this the mean of Toronto ranges at —341, —33, —32 all reduced to
    ——33 likewise, and so on for other couplets.    Finally, in Table III,
   each series has been reduced so as to represent the sum of 12 years
   Inequalities, and the sun-spot series have been equalised in the same
   way as the terrestrial observations, because in instituting any
   comparison with respect to magnitude it is desirable that the same
   treatment should have been applied to both.
       In a previous part of our paper (Art. 15) we spoke of a subsidiary
   service which was to be rendered by the Kew temperature-ranges.
   We propose to regard these as terrestrial pointers or indicators by
   the aid of which we may distinguish the one Toronto maximum from
   the other. It will be found that one of the Toronto maxima occurs
  in date about 8 or 9 days before the single maximum of the corre
  sponding Kew Inequality.       This Toronto maximum, so indicated by a
  strictly terrestrial method, we have <U+FB01>xed upon as our starting point,
  and at this point all the Toronto Inequalities in Table     III are made
  to begin. The Toronto Inequalities thus placed are then compared
   with sun-spot and Kew temperature-range Inequalities of similar
  period, so arranged that the three members of the same triplet
  always start on the same day; in other 'words, the numbers on the
'
  same horizontal line and belonging to the various members of the
  same triplet denote simultaneous phenomena.                           _
      'In order to make this comparison it is necessary that the Inequali
  ties compared together should be consistent with their prevalent type;
  for instance, the Kew temperature-range Inequality must present a
  single maximum and minimum suf<U+FB01>ciently well at least to admit of
  serving its of<U+FB01>ce as a pointer.   In like manner the Toronto tempera.
  ture-range     must  be a double,  and the sun~spot a single Inequality.
  \Ve must, therefore, examine the couplets of Table     II in order to see

   In the preceding table the settings have been arranged by strictly
terrestrial considerations. If, therefore, there is no connexion between
terrestrial and solar Inequalities, the sun-spot maxima should be
distributed impartially up and down the table without any other than
chance grouping together.        Their behaviour       however, very dif

whether they are real or only apparent Inequalities, it may be inte
resting to exhibit in Table IV (p. 308) the largest solar Inequality
with which we have as yet come into contact.                     The <U+FB01>gures given
represent the sums of twelve yearly Inequalities, the whole 36
years being split into three series of 12 years each.                    The amount
of repetition will be seen from a comparison of these three
series, which are exhibited, <U+FB01>rst, without any equalisation, and
secondly, with' the same amount of equalisation which has been
applied to the terrestrial Inequalities around 26 days (Art. 12).                      p
   19. Comparison.     in Length of Period—The comparative magnitudes
of the various solar Inequalities around            26 days are estimated after
the manner already described—that is to say, by adding together
the various yearly results appropriately placed, and then in the <U+FB01>nal
Inequality so obtained summing up the various (26) departures,
whether positive or negative.
   The two right hand <U+FB01>gures are dismissed both for celestial and

terrestrial Inequalities as in the previous instance.                        The series of
years is the same, and the same use is made of the Kew temperature
ranges as in the Inequalities around 24 days.
    In the Table V (p. 309) we have, inclosed in brackets, the positions
of all suf<U+FB01>ciently well-de<U+FB01>ned maximum Inequalities, whether of sun
spots or Toronto temperature-ranges.                        It will be seen, as in the
previous case, that the positions of maximum apparent Inequalities
for sun-spots are near those for Toronto temperature-ranges ; and the
same remarks are here applicable which have already been made.
    20. Constancy of Type in the various Inequalities.—-Here, as in the
Inequalities around 24 days, the Toronto temperature-ranges present
on the whole two maxima and two minima, the sun-spots one well
de<U+FB01>ned maximum and minimum; and the Kew temperature-ranges
one maximum and minimum, not so well de<U+FB01>ned.
    21. Comparison in Phase—For the purpose of making this com
parison, we proceed to discuss the various couplets of Table V, taking
 as before the time-scales in our comparison from the Toronto tem
 perature Inequalities rather than from the sun-spots!

   " In this table all the Inequalities are aggregates for 12 years, and have all been equalised in the same manner (see Art. 12). The Toronto Inequality +10                    is       118
somewhat irregular, but it has been retained, partly to exhibit an instance of comparison in which one of the members departs somewhat from the usual type.

    It thus appears that, out of eight cases, the sun-spots do not depart
 from their type in a single instance, while Toronto temperature
range Inequalities are too irregular to admit of comparison in three,
and Kew temperature-range Inequalities in two cases, leaving four
unexceptiouable cases for comparison. These are exhibited in Table VI
and in Diagram     II in a manner exactly similar to that in which the
24-day Inequalities were exhibited in Table         III and in Diagram I.
Also from Table VI we may draw conclusions exactly similar to those
 which we drew from Table III, the two tables exhibiting virtually
the same behaviour of the various Inequalities.
                            Concluding Remarks.
    22. We would remark, in the <U+FB01>rst place, that there are two possible
kinds of periodicity with respect to sun-spots, and that it is not neces
sary to regard the Inequalities around 24 days and those around 26
days as perfectly similar phenomena.       To illustrate our meaning, let
the reader imagine that some one de<U+FB01>nite hemisphere of the sun is in
the habit of periodically losing its brilliaucy and then becoming
luminous again, while, however, the other hemisphere remains con
stant in its lustre. We may imagine that, in the course of time,
an inhabitant of the earth would view these phenomena from all
possible quarters and in all possible phases, the result of which would
be that, on an average, there would be a falling off in light corre
sponding to the times of extinction, and no falling off corresponding
to the times of maximum lustre.        We should, therefore, have what
might be termed a solar Inequality of the <U+FB01>rst kind.
    Next, suppose that the sun by rotation carries round this state of
things, and thus brings next the earth the peculiar solar meridian
which passes through the central point of the darkness.         Sometimes
the earth would view this meridian at its blackest and sometimes at its
brightest, but, on the whole, it would present an average lustre midway

             Sun-spot Areas and       Diurnal Temperature-Ranges.              313
  between brightness and blackness. On the other hand, the meridian
  on the opposite side of this would pass before the earth always bright.
  There would thus be a period representing the synodical period of one
  solar rotation with respect to the earth, and this might be termed a
  solar Inequality of the second kind.
     There seems some reason, from the observations of Broun and Horn
  stein, to think that peculiar districts, if not a peculiar hemisphere, of
  the sun may be affected by spots in the way we have mentioned, the
  result of which would be that we should have amongst the Inequalities
  of sun-spots one representing the synodical period of revolution of the
 sun with respect to the earth. Professor Stokes has likewise sug
 gested the desirability of seeing whether there may not be such a
 period. Now it seems to us that the proof in favour of such a period
 would not be invalidated by the occurrence of several periods around
 26 days; inasmuch as observations founded on sun-spots might pre.
 sent the same variety of period, when treated as we have treated
 them, which they presented when treated in another way by Car
 rington, who found that the spots in one solar latitude had a different
 period of rotation from those in another. It seems, therefore, quite
 possible that the periods around 26 days may denote the synodical
 period with respect to the earth of certain spot-producing solar
 centres not far distant from the equatorial regions, where, according
 to Carrington and others, the rotation is quickest.
    The Inequalities around 24 days have, however, too short a period
 to admit of the same interpretation being put upon them, inasmuch
 as they correspond more nearly with the time of rotation of the sun
 as regards a <U+FB01>xed point in space than with his time of rotation as
regards the earth; and here we come to a fact which is worthy of
 being recorded, although we cannot pretend to discuss it exhaustively
in our present paper. It is that the Inequalities around 26 days
represent with much accuracy what would be the synodic periods
with respect to the earth of the Inequalities around 24 days. In
other words, the two sets of Inequalities appear to be related to each
other, as if the 24-day series represented in time not merely the period
of a variable state of things, but likewise one revolution with regard
to a <U+FB01>xed line of space; while the second or 26-day series represents
one revolution of the same phenomenon with respect to the earth
regarded as the point of view. This would seem to indicate, if con
<U+FB01>rmed by further inquiry, that the Inequalities around 24 days have
reference to something without the sun,* inasmuch as we may imagine
the maxima and the minima of the 24-day Inequalities to take place
when certain districts of the sun come opposite certain <U+FB01>xed positions
of space.
    * This peculiar correspondence is perhaps best indicated by the Toronto Tempe
rature-range  observations which we think may o<U+FB01>er the most trustworthy means of

314          Prof. Balfour Stewart and Mr. W. L. Carpenter.
  But while it is not certain that the sun-spot Inequalities                                                  around
26 days are phenomena precisely similar to those around 24! days, it
would appear that the two sets of solar Inequalities are related to
corresponding terrestrial Inequalities as nearly as possible in the same
way, any small difference between Tables      and VI being as likely   III
due to insuf<U+FB01>cient observations as to any physical cause.   We may
now bring together the results we have obtained as follows :—
  a.     Sun-spot Inequalities around 24: and 26 days, whether apparent or
          real, seem to correspond closely in period with terrestrial Ine
          qualities as exhibited by the daily temperature-range at Toronto
                                                                        -
           and at Kew.
   f3.   While     the      sun-spot      and the Kew temperature-range        Inequalities
           present evidence            of  a single oscillation, the corresponding Toronto
           temperature-range               Inequalities present evidence          a double        of
      oscillation.
  q. Setting the Inequalities as we have done, the sun-spot maximum
      occurs about eight or nine days after one   the Toronto maxima,         of
      and the Kew maximum about seven days after the same Toronto
           mawirnum.                                                                       .
   8.    The proportional oscillation exhibited          the temperature-range
                                                                             by
           Inequalities    much less than that exhibited
                                is                            the corresponding       by
           solar Inequalities.
   Itmust be borne in mind that the truth of        connexion between             a
celestial and terrestrial phenomena can only be decided by cumulative
evidence of various kinds.
   What we claim to have here done     to have given reasons for suppos
                                                         is

                         is         in time-scale and a de<U+FB01>nite relation
in type and phase between sun-spot and temperature-range Inequalities,
estimating     periods      with exactness.   If we slightly equalise the Inequalities                                of
Tables    11 and   V     by taking means of three, we obtain the following result :—

                                  I
   In the following pages give an account of several new phenomena,
some of which have a direct bearing on the theory of the discharge of
                                               I
electricity through gases. Although hope that the experiments may
be judged independently of any theory, their description may be ren
dered a little more clear and interesting if I- begin with a short expla
nation of the theoretical views to which they seem to me to-point.
   These theoretical conclusions will be looked at favourably,- think,      I
by those who have been trained up with the ideas of Faraday and
Maxwell; for they must have always considered it likely that the
conduction of electricity through gases is more probably due to some
thing resembling the electrolytic conduction in liquids than to the
direct passage of electricity from one molecule to another. My
experiments with mercury vapour argue very stroneg in favour of
this view.
                         Fundamental Points of      the  Theory.
   I  know, from private conversations, that many of those well able to
judge consider some electrolytic action in a gas as probable whenever
an electric discharge takes place through it. But owing, no doubt,
to the want of experimental evidence, very little has been published
bearing on this point.            Mr. J. J. Thomson? has recently supported
this view.       His ideas are of utility for the explanation of some
phenomena attending the spark discharges, but they furnish no clue
towards the explanation of the asymmetry of the glow discharge, and
of some appearances which by many are considered as characteristic
and fundamental in the passage of electricity through gases. N0
consistent attempt towards a systematic theoretical discussion of
these facts has yet been made.
   I  am afraid that I can only offer a very crude beginning of such a
discussion, but       I  have suf<U+FB01>cient con<U+FB01>dence in the correctness of its
fundamental views to submit them to the judgment of the scienti<U+FB01>c
  *  I  have not in this preliminary paper been able to do full justice to those to
whose labours   I  think it is chie<U+FB02>y due that this subject has become ripe for theo
retical deduction.     I may mention here the names of De La Rue and Muller,
Crookes,  Goldstein,   Gustav Wiedemann and Riihlmann, and Eilhard Wiedemann ;
but the two authors whom        I  have most often found it necessary to consult are
undoubtedly Faraday and Hittorf.

318                Dr. A. Schuster.       Experiments     on the
public.     I shall avoid as much as possible all suppositions and hypo
theses  which    cannot be put to the test of experiment; but it seems
necessary to start with some assumption, in order to avoid too great a
vagueness in the subsequent explanations.             The assumption which     I
shall make is this:         In a gas, the passage of electricity from one
molecule to another is always accompanied by an interchange _of the
atoms composing the molecule.            I have been much struck with the
results of some experiments recently made by Mr. L. J. Blake in
Professor Von Helmholtz’s laboratory;              investigating the vapours
rising from the surfaces of warm liquids which were kept charged to a
high potential, he found that these vapours were entirely unelectri<U+FB01>ed.
Di<U+FB01>'erent liquids were tried—such as pure water, water containing
salts in solution, and mercury.         Now, if it is found, that the vapour
actually rising from an electri<U+FB01>ed liquid is not electri<U+FB01>ed, can we
imagine that a molecule striking an electri<U+FB01>ed surface in its rapid
motion should carry away with it any part of the electricity, or that
one molecule should be able to communicate electricity to another in
an encounter?        Assuming that we cannot, we are led at once to the
supposition that the discharge in gases is accompanied by a breaking
up of the molecules.          But this does not seem to me to be quite
su<U+FB02>icient to account for all phenomena, and especially not for those
involving strati<U+FB01>cations.        There is reason to think that the formation
of unstable compounds, such as ozone, plays an important part in the
glow discharge.         It is very likely essential to the production of
strati<U+FB01>cations.
   The test of any theory must be found in the numerical results it is
capable of giving.        Hitherto, however, the qualitative phenomena
have not, in my opinion, been suf<U+FB01>ciently separated from the great
number of disturbing e<U+FB01>ects to allow us to give a decisive value to
quantitative measurements. Though I. shall not discuss the few
measurements       which I have been able to make,           I  shall point out
where numerical results can be most easily obtained by the theory
and tested by experiment.          I do not pretend to explain all the phe
nomena of the discharge, but         I shall attempt to show that there is no
distinct  contradiction     between   the theory, in favour of which   I argue,
and the facts ; that is more than can be said of any other theory that
has been proposed.        I  shall try to prove in the present paper that the
molecules are,    in  all probability, [broken up at the negative pole.
                     Ewperiments with Mercury Vapour.
   According to the kinetic theory of gases, the molecule of mercury
vapour consists of a single atom, which is incapable of vibration.
Mercury has a very brilliant spectrum, which proves that the theory
is incomplete in some important point,              It is well known, on the
other   hand,   that the   theoretical  conclusion .receives support from .the

fact that the vapour-density of mercury vapour is anomalous.              If,   as
is   generally   supposed,the molecule of the simple gases contains
two atoms, that of mercury can only contain one. At any rate, we
are justi<U+FB01>ed in asserting that the molecule of mercury vapour has a
simpler composition than that of most gases. If, then, an essential
part of the glow discharge is due to the breaking up of the molecules,
we might expect mercury vapour to present other and much simpler
phenomena than the gases with which we are generally accustomed
                                             I
to work. This, indeed, is the case; for <U+FB01>nd that if the mercury vapour
is sa<U+FB01>iciently freefrom air, the discharge through     it,
                                                       shows no negative
glow, no dark spaces, and no strati<U+FB01>cations.   In view of the importance
of the fact,I   have paid a good deal of attention to this point, and, in
spite of some experimental dii<U+FB01>culties,  I  have considerable con<U+FB01>dence
that the statement which     Ihave made     true. The one fact which up
                                             is
to recently has made me speak with caution consists in the altered
conditions under which the experiments with mercury have to be
carried on, but  I  think that   Ihave now a complete answer to the
objection which might be raised on that ground.
   One dif<U+FB01>culty consists in the choice of electrodes. Aluminium                is
attacked by mercury vapour, and experiments made with aluminium
might therefore be objected to as not conclusive. Platinum            the is
only metal which can be conveniently used, but platinum blackens
the tube very rapidly and prevents the examination of the parts sur
rounding the negative  electrode.  I have found    convenient to use plati

num electrodes surrounded by       asmall glass tube open at its end. The
discharge can then pass freely from the open end, and the glass tube
prevents the deposit of platinum in the outer tube.     But the platinum
may even protrude to     asmall extent, as the deposit, unless  it   thick,
                                                                     is
seems to combine and alloy easily with the mercury in the tube.          If
the glass tube surrounding the metal electrode does not <U+FB01>t too closely
the discharge will partly pass through the interstice and heat up the
glass, which then becomes      a suf<U+FB01>ciently good conductor to allow the
discharge to pass through it, which     is an advantage, as the electrodes
then have    alarger area  of  active  surface.   My tubes had two such
electrodes, and contained also quantity of mercury, varying perhaps
                                   a
from to cub. centims. They were attached to a Sprengel pump.

Both sulphuric acid and phosphoric anhydride were used for drying
           '
purposes. After all the air was as much as possible exhausted,
the mercury was heated up to its boiling point.     When this had
repeatedly been done and the tube kept at the pump for at least
a day, the discharge from my coil; which gives a good 4-inch spark
in air, would not pass, and there was not     trace of <U+FB02>uorescence.

320              Dr. A. Schuster.     Experiments   on the
made.    I have varied the conditions of the experiments in many ways,
but always with the same result.          When the air was suf<U+FB01>ciently
expelled, the spark does not break through the tube at the ordinary
temperature; when the' mercury is heated the discharge passes, but
always in a perfectly continuous stream, joining the positive and
negative electrode.   It is dif<U+FB01>cult to prevent small bubbles of mercury
from condensing on the surface of the glass, and the absence of dark
space and glow might be explained by the irregularities thus intro
duced, but I think the following observations conclusive in this
respect.
   The mercury in the tube would always at <U+FB01>rst contain small bubbles
of air  between it and the glass, and these could be purposely left, say,
on one side, by volatilising the mercury always on the other.         One
tube could in this way be prepared which, with a small but visible
bubble on one side kept down by the mercury, did not allow the
discharge to pass. If the mercury was heated without disturbing the
bubble, the current passed, illuminating the tube with a perfectly
continuous stream of light.       As soon, however, as the bubble was
driven into the tube, a perfectly distinct and clear dark space became
visible at once.
   The following observation was also repeatedly made.            As the
electrodes generally contain a large quantity of air dissolved in
them, I have been accustomed to send through my various tubes :1
very strong discharge, using a Wilde dynamo machine as a primary
current.    The currents thus obtained     I  have found very useful in
driving out the air from the electrodes. While the mercury was kept
hot a strong current was thus sent through the tubes.           Instanta
neously a dark space appeared surrounding the negative electrode;
the appearance presented was that of a discharge through mercury
superposed on one through air, and whether these discharges passed
through the tube simultaneously or one after the other, the result
proved that the dark space and glow can and generally do appear
under the exact conditions under which they are absent in mercury
vapour.     The strong current of the dynamo machine has generally
been fatal to the life of the tube, and    I am not sure that I have ever
been able to examine the discharge from electrodes really free of air.
To that small remnant of air it is due, perhaps, that the discharge,
though continuous, was seldom quite symmetrical with respect to the two
poles.   There generally seemed to be a tendency to surround the nega
tive, and to set out only from the point of the positive electrode. But
 the appearance was much disturbed‘by globules of condensed mercury
on the electrodes; sometimes both electrodes were equally surrounded
by the discharge, and sometimes the latter would pass only from the
points.

an asymmetry.          I  have noticed a very curious tendency of the
discharge    at  the negative pole, to start rather from the glass out of
which the electrode protrudes, than from the metal electrode. The
glass is heated up in that case and a bright yellow, sodium spot is
seen at the point from which the current in the vapour sets out.
When the discharge sets out from the metal an amalgam of mercury
and platinum, or mercury and aluminium, is formed.              The subject
requires further investigation.—July, 1884.]
   It is more dif<U+FB01>cult to prevent strat-i<U+FB01>cations than to prevent the
dark space and glow. A mixture of air and mercury shows beautiful
strati<U+FB01>cations.      When the air is expelled as much as possible,   I never
saw strati<U+FB01>cations while the tubes were attached to the pump, but in
order to study the phenomena a little better I sealed off some of the
tubes and heated them up either in a steam or para<U+FB02>in bath, so as to
give them the same temperature throughout.              It is then that the
strati<U+FB01>cations are very apt to occur at a temperature of 100° C., when
the tension of mercury vap0ur would, according to Beguault, be
three-quarters of a millimetre.       The extreme dif<U+FB01>culty, however, of
excluding all traces of air easily explains this, while the irregularity
of the phenomenon, and its absence in the experiments which were
carried on with the greatest care, seem to me to be conclusive in
proving that pure mercury vapour never shows any strati<U+FB01>cations, for
the experiments were continued until the tension of merCury vapour
was 20 millims.
   My assistant, Mr. Arthur Stanton, has taken some photographs of
the spark in mercury vapour at different pressures.
   Figs. (1a) and (1b), Plate 4, represent the spark in mercury at a
uniform temperature of 50°. The tension of mercury vapour at that
temperature according to Regnault is 0'1 millim. Figs. 2a and 21)
represent the discharge at a temperature of 100° and a tension of 0‘7,
while in <U+FB01>gs. 3a and 3b the temperature was 150° and the tension
4'3 millim. In the <U+FB01>gures marked a the pole on the left hand side
was negative, while in the <U+FB01>gures marked b the negative pole was to
the right. The electrodes were platinum wires surrounded by glass
tubes open at the end; and in <U+FB01>gs. 2 and 3 the tendency of the
discharge at the negative pole to start as far back as possible from
the glass, rather than from the metal, is well seen.
   I  have reason to think that the vapour of sodium resembles that of
mercury, and does not show any dark intervals.            From the fact that
at the temperature of the spark sodium shows its line spectrum instead
of the bands, we may conclude that we have also to deal in that case
with a monatomic molecule.
                Evidence of Dissociation during  the Discharge.
   There    is very    strong spectroscopic evidence that gases     through

322              Dr. A. Schuster.      Experiments     on the
which an electric current is passing are always in a state of rapid
dissociation.   Thus   I  do not know of a single case in which the gas
during the glow discharge does not show two, or generally even three,
distinct spectra in the same or in different parts of the tube.          This
dissociation seems especially strong in the negative glow.                The
characteristic spectrum which gases, as a        rule,  show   in  the neigh
bourhood of the negative electrode bears evidence of belonging to a
complex molecule, but at the same time a high temperature line
spectrum is always seen to overlap the bands.            I  have shown some
time ago that the spectrum of the negative pole cannot be explained
by mere peculiarities of temperature, and, further, that it must be
due to the formation of a distinct molecule, as the spectrum keeps its
original place even a short time after the current has been reversed.
                                                         I
   As the subject is one that is not much studied, may be permitted
to give here a short account of the- spectral phenomena seen in tubes
<U+FB01>lled with different gases.
   Nitrogen.—This gas shows in the positive half a well-known com
plicated band spectrum. The glow shows peculiar bands, but the
strongest nitrogen lines are also always visible, and it is generally
only there that the lines are seen. The capillary part will only show
lines when its bore is very small, as, for instance, when a piece of
thermometer tubing is used.        As the bands of the positive half are
also seen in the glow, this region shows the superposition of three
distinct spectra.   There is at present no longer any doubt that this
means the superposition of three distinct sets of molecules.
    Oxygen shows phenomena exactly corresponding                to those in
nitrogen.    The  positive  part as regards  character    shows   what I have
called the complex     line  spectrum, which  stands   in  a remarkable   way
between a line and a band spectrum.             The negative glow shows
 characteristic bands, and at the same time both the spectrum of the
positive pole and traces of the high temperature line spectrum of
 oxygen. Here, again, we have three distinct sorts of molecules in the
glow.
    The phenomena in hydrogen are not as yet so well ascertained. The
positive half and also the glow show generally a band spectrum
 which now is generally ascribed to hydrogen ; but, at the same time,
the lines are very strong. I do not know whether a peculiar spectrum
has ever been noticed or looked for at the negative pole, but, owing to
the complexity of the band spectrum, it would be rather di<U+FB02>icult to
discover. No gas shows greater dif<U+FB01>culties of puri<U+FB01>cation, and there
fore the spectroscopic appearances are much more doubtful in this
than in the other gases.
    Carbon compounds show their characteristic spectra whenever they
 are not very rapidly decomposed; but at the same time they always
show at least in the negative glow the true carbon spectrum.           I have

                 Discharge   of Electricity through   Gases.           323
already on a former occasion drawn attention to the very suggestive
 fact that the compounds in which the molecules are made up of two
 or more carbon atoms (cyanogen, hydrocarbons) give the carbon bands,
 while those containing only one atom (carbonic oxide) show the true
line spectrum of carbon. Angstriim and Thalén observe that the violet
line of carbon is generally visible in tubes <U+FB01>lled with carbonic oxide,
but    I have only observed this line in the negative glow, where it
undoubtedly is visible even when no trace of it can be seen in any
other part of the tube.      I have also observed that tubes <U+FB01>lled with
carbonic oxide show a band peculiar to the negative pole. Though
this observation is nearly ten years old,        I   have hitherto left it
unpublished together with other matter bearing on the same point, as
I  had hoped to <U+FB01>nd time to complete my investigations and to write
a general description of the spectra of carbon compounds.
    I do not think that any of the other gases have been sut<U+FB01>ciently
well investigated to be noticed here; but some observations which        I
have made at different times on the spectrum of chlorine con<U+FB01>rm the
general conclusion which     l have drawn.                      .
   Messrs. De La Rue and Muller have noticed in some of their
experiments a sudden expansion of the gas when the discharge was
sent through it. They have- proved that this expansion is not due to
increased temperature, and a breaking up of the molecules into atoms
seems to me to be its next natural explanation.
   While we thus have ample evidence of dissociation whenever an
electric current passes through a gas, we also <U+FB01>nd that whatever
increases independently the dissociation improves the conducting
power of the gas. Thus we know that a <U+FB02>ame is a good conductor,
and Hittorf has, in a series of very interesting experiments, shown
that if we heat up the electrodes to a white heat, an electromotive
force of a few volts will send a current through the gas.
    The fact also discovered by Hittorf, that if a discharge is set up a
small electromotive force is su<U+FB02>icient to pass a current across, is also
easily explained by our theory, as the original discharge throws the
molecules into that state of dissociation which favours the passage of
the current.
        On the In<U+FB02>uence of a Positive Electrode on  the Negative Glow.
   I now   pass to the description of a series of experiments which seem
to me to be only capable of explanation by the views brought forward
in this paper, and   I  should like therefore to consider them as crucial
experiments    which   have  to be explained by any true theory of the
electric discharge.
   It was up to recently believed that the form and extent of the
negative glow was determined only by the shape of the negative
electrode, but was independent of the shape of the vessel or the

324                Dr. A. Schuster.      Experiments    on the
neighbourhood of another electrode.            Goldstein has, however, de
scribed some e<U+FB02>t'ects of negative electrodes on each other, and E.
Wiedemann has recently made an experiment in which some remark
able e<U+FB01>ects were seen on the approach of the positive electrode to the
kathode. Professor Wiedemann’s experiment belongs to the same class
as those presently to be described, but di<U+FB01>ers from mine in so far as it
refers to very great exhaustion at which the glow is no longer visible,
while   I  have generally worked at much higher pressures and especially
studied the e<U+FB01>ect on the glow.          The peculiarity of the arrangement
which    I  have used  consists in the large size of the negative electrode,
which allows a much easier observation of the parts at which the
negative glow chie<U+FB02>y settles.      I shall show that it tends to accumulate
away   from   the  positive electrode.
    The glow which surrounds the negative electrode is divided into
three layers which are, however, only clearly separated when the
pressure has been reduced to the fraction of a millimeter.           The <U+FB01>rst
layer   narrow,   and  closely surrounding    the  negative electrode,  is with
new electrodes of a beautiful golden colour. Its spectrum is chie<U+FB02>y made
up of the hydrogen and sodium lines. The sodium is evidently due to
matter which has settled on the metal, and the hydrogen comes out
of the metal where it was absorbed.          In time these lines disappear,
the layer has its golden colour, and the spectrum is now that of the
positive half of the discharge.         The second layer is the so-called
dark space.      The name is a good one, although Goldstein has pointed
out that this layer is only relatively not absolutely dark.                 Its
luminosity depends much on the gas used.              With nitrogen it seems
to me to be much darker than with the hydrocarbons.            The thickness
 of this dark space is according to the measurements of Puluj about
 forty or <U+FB01>fty times as great as the mean free path in air at the same
 pressure. But the thickness depends on many circumstances, and
 would not, according to Puluj, be quite proportional to the mean
 free path at different pressures as we should expect it to be; but
 measurements of this sort can be only very approximate at present.
    The third layer is the glow proper.         When the curvature of the
 electrode is small its inner boundary is sometimes de<U+FB01>ned with quite
 a remarkable sharpness, but this also depends on the gas which is
 used.     The outer boundary of the glow extends to different distances,
 according to the intensity of the current, the size of the electrode,
 and partly also its shape.       It would be ,useless at present to enter
 further into the diiferent causes which in<U+FB02>uence the thickness and
 de<U+FB01>nition of these different layers.
    The glow is separated from the positive part of the discharge by a
 non-luminous space, sometimes also called the dark space.             In order
  to prevent confusion    I propose the name
                                                 “ dark interval” for it.
    I have used in my experiments on the glow a cylinder open at one

                 Discharge   of Electricity through    Gases.          325
end.    Its internal diameter was 15 centims., its height 38 centims.
The open end was closed by means of a brass disk into which a
groove had been cut. The rim of the open end of the cylinder was
cemented into this groove. A circular hole 5'5 centims. in diameter was
cut into the centre of the brass disk, and another glass cylinder was
<U+FB01>tted into this hole. The negative electrode was formed by a piece of
aluminium foil 8 centims. long, which was wrapped round the inner
cylinder.    The electrode had a surface therefore of over 120 square
centims. A long aluminium wire running parallel to the axis of the
aluminium cylinder at a distance of about an inch formed the positive
electrode. The aluminium cylinder was connected metallically to the
brass disk, so that the positive electrode had to be insulated from it.
This was done by passing it through a glass tube which was cemented
into the brass plate. This tube also formed the opening through
which the exhaustion could be carried on. The aluminium wire had,
of course, to be connected with a platinum wire sealed into the tube.
The accompanying <U+FB01>gure shows a section of the vessel.
                                    Fig. 1.
   As  an air-pump   I have used    Hagen’s form of the Toepler mercury
pump. As the vessel to be exhausted was rather large, the exhaustion
was a little laborious, and had to be carried on with great care.         I
need hardly add that the effects to be described are not the result of a
single experiment, but that the vessel was often re<U+FB01>lled and exhausted
in the course of them.       I  shall now describe what is observed on
exhaustion.
   At <U+FB01>rst the discharge, of     course,   only passes as a spark. It runs
irregularly along the wire and passes to the nearest point of the
aluminium cylinder.     Gradually the glow settles down on the cylinder.
if that is negative, as    I  shall assume it to be. The glow is quite
irregular and not always at the same place, but a tendency to avoid
the place opposite the wire is already apparent. In fact the e<U+FB01>ect

326               Dr. A. Schuster.     Ewpe<U+FB01>ments on the
was <U+FB01>rst     discovered at this    stage of the    exhaustion.    The glow
gradually becomes wider.     At <U+FB01>rst it con<U+FB01>nes itself to the half-cylinder
which lies towards the positive wire, but it is very irregular in shape.
During the <U+FB01>rst exhaustion, it was interesting to notice how on one
day there were some spots on the aluminium cylinder which were
illuminated with especial brilliancy by the glow, while on the next
the same spots were remarkable by the absence of any glow above
them. All these effects depend of course on the state of the
aluminium surface; gradually this becomes more uniform and the
glow more steady.
    On exhaustion the glow gradually covers the whole aluminium
surface; but a dark strip about 2 or 3 centims. in width is observed
directly opposite the positive wire. The appearance is well represented
by <U+FB01>g. 4, Plate 4, representing a photograph taken of the phenomenon.
I  shall refer to the dark strip as the “dark area.” As exhaustion
proceeds, the glow extends further into the vessel.         The dark space
surrounding    the cylinder becomes   more  apparent   and expands, but the
dark area loses its sharpness.      Fig. represents
                                         5              a photograph taken
at this stage.    The dark area increases slightly in width with decreas
ing strength of current.
    When the cylinder is positive and the wire negative, very little is
seen of the positive part of the discharge.        At pressures of about a
millimeter two reddish-yellow bands are noticed running parallel to
the axis of the cylinder on either side, and symmetrical to the wire.
 They are too faint to be photographed. When the exhaustion is carried
 further these bands become less and less distinct, and gradually
 disappear.
    I shall describe in another part of the paper some curious phenomena
 which are seen on sudden reversal of the current either in one direc
 tion or another, also the ellects of a magnet inside the aluminium
 cylinder on the glow surrounding it.
   Explanation of  the Repulsive Efect 0f  the Positive Electrode on Glow.
    The following seems to me a plausible explanation of the phenomenon
 which I have just described.        The rapid fall of potential which is
 observed on crossing the negative electrode suggests at once, inde
 pendently of any theory, that we have to deal with the action of a
 condenser, for we know that no statical charge can produce a <U+FB01>nite
 ditference of potential at the electrode, while a double layer will
 produce a discontinuity.      Although it may not be proved that an
  absolute discontinuity of potential exists at the kathode, it is yet
  certain that a very rapid fall takes place.    This is all that is neces
  sary for the argument.
     We recognise such a double layer in the case of electrolytes, but

                   Discharge   of Electricity   through Gases.     .    327
  there is an essential di<U+FB01>erence in the thickness of the layer within
  which we must imagine that condenser action to take place.           In the
  liquids  that  thickness  must be very small, as is shown  by the intensity
  of the observed polarisation currents. The positively electri<U+FB01>ed matter
  in every case is kept against the negative surface by a joint action of
  electrical and chemical forces, for it has been shown by Helmholtz
  that only thus can we explain a di<U+FB02>’erence of potential between two
  bodies.    It is the chemical forces which keep the two electricities
  asunder. The gaseous molecules or atoms, however, subject to their
  mutual encounters, and always having certain velocities, will tend to
  leave the surface.     They are kept near the surface by the electrical
  forces.I     do not, of course, mean to imply that the positive part of
  the condenser is always made up of the same molecules, but only
  that the time during which each positively electri<U+FB01>ed particle forms
  part of the condenser is large compared to the time during which it
  would be in the neighbourhood of the electrode if they were both
  unelectri<U+FB01>ed.
     Suppose, now, that a positive electrode is placed near such a con
  denser.    The resistance of the gas is so much greater than that of
  the metal electrode that we shall assume the whole electrode to be of
  the same potential.      The lines of force will then cut the surface at
 right angles, and could we assume the condenser to be in<U+FB01>nitely thin,
 there would only be a normal force acting on its particles; but as the
 lines of force are curved, the particles not in immediate contact with
 the surface are acted on by a tangential force which will tend to drive
 them away from the positive electrode.         As a steady state will only
 be possible when the total force is normal throughout the condenser,
 we arrive at the condition for the steady state that within the con
 denser the fall of potential must be the same for equal distances
 measured along the normal to the surface.
     Some idea of the distribution of potential may be gained by con
 sidering a positively charged point near two concentric spheres, the
 inner one of which is charged with negative electricity.         The outer
 sphere representing the outer coating of the condenser will act as
 screen ; the distribution on the inner sphere will therefore be uniform.
 The analogy is, of course, not complete, as we cannot assume the
positively electri<U+FB01>ed particles to be distributed over a surface merely.
     Our experimental evidence speaks in favour of the conclusion to
which we have arrived, namely, that the fall of potential is equal for
equal distances taken normally away from the negative electrode.
This seems to follow at least from the fact that the boundary of the
dark space   is,   whenever that   is possible, equidistant from the elec
trode, for we know that the width of the dark space depends on the
intensity of current.      When the electrode    isof such a shape that the
normal drawn outwards from        it meets its surface again, or whenever

328              Dr. A. Schuster.     Experiments   on the
negative electrodes are near one another, more complicated phenomena
arise which we need not discuss here.
   It is curious to observe the boundary of the dark space when the
electrode is a cylinder.  Round the surface of the cylinder the boundary
of the dark space is a concentric cylinder.      Opposite the end of the
cylinder it is a plane, and the plane and cylinder are united by means
of a surface, which is the envelope of spheres drawn with the same
radius from the circular edge of the cylinder as centre, that is to
say, by means of a part of a circular ring made up of quadrants.
Goldstein has described similar forms of dark spaces.         The point of
interest, however, is this: that while on the cylindrical and plane
surfaces the boundary of the dark space is well marked and bright,
it is extremely indistinct on the circular ring. The amount of elec
tricity crossing each part of the surface seems to be the same, while
wherever the lines of <U+FB02>ow separate the intensity of the current must
decrease.    We obtain in this way a smaller intensity of current at
the annular surface.
    Hitherto we have only assumed a certain number of particles
 positively electri<U+FB01>ed in the immediate neighbourhood of the negative
 electrode, and we have left it altogether undecided what these particles
 are.   But if we consider now the fact that the glow does not appear
 opposite the positive electrode, that is to say, that while the fall of
 potential is the same all over the surface, the <U+FB02>ow is stronger at some
 places than at others, we are driven to the conclusion that the <U+FB02>ow does
 not altogether depend on the fall of potential, and we must again look
 for an explanation in the chemical as well as the electric forces.
 \Vherever the fall of potential is chie<U+FB02>y produced by the presence of
 the positively electri<U+FB01>ed particles, which    I  now assume to be the
 decomposed molecules of the gas, these will help by their chemical
 action to decompose other molecules.      Opposite the positive pole the
 fall of potential is principally due to nearness of that electrode;
 chemical forces .are absent, and the molecules will not be decomposed.
 This is, I believe, the explanation of the dark area. And it brings
 with it the explanation of a large quantity of other facts, as, for
 instance, the one which has been so long observed and well established,
 that once a current is set up in the gas it requires a much smaller
 electromotive force to keep it going. For the discharge, according
 to us, will generally be introduced by a spark which must give the
 <U+FB01>rst supply of decomposed molecules before the continuous glow
 discharge can establish itself.
    The e<U+FB01>ect of an increase of current on the dark area is also easily
 explained, but I do not propose to go into details in the present
 paper.
     If my explanation is true, we must expect the glow to be strong
  bet ween two negative electrodes, and that is the case.

                 Discharge  of Electricity through   Gases.           329
   I  may for the sake of clearness once more mention shortly the
principal points of the argument.
   The rapid fall of potential in the neighbourhood of the negative
electrode renders the presence of positively electri<U+FB01>ed particles in its
neighbourhood necessary.
   If the distance through which the condenser action takes place is
sensible, the positively electri<U+FB01>ed particles will be acted upon by a
neighbouring positive electrode.
   A steady state will be established in which the fall of potential
along the normal from the surface will be everywhere the same.
   As however the <U+FB02>ow is stronger away from the positive electrode, we
must conclude that other forces besides electrical forces determine the
<U+FB02>ow.
   It is natural to assume that these are chemical forces : that in other
words the positively electri<U+FB01>ed particles are the decomposed molecules,
which by their presence assist the decomposition of others, and there
fore the formation of the current.
   Unless a <U+FB02>aw is detected in this line of argument, I think that the
conclusion must be granted, namely, that the decomposition of the
molecules at the negative electrode is essential to the formation of
the glow discharge.     This is really all that I endeavour to support in
this paper. The rest can only be settled by further experiments.
And amongst the rest I count also the primary cause which originally
produces the decomposition of molecules at one pole rather than at
another.     It is possibly due to an electromotive force of contact
between    the  gas and the electrodes which tends to make the gas
electronegative.
   It does not seem dif<U+FB01>cult to explain by our theory the phenomena
which happen at the negative electrode on exhaustion.           When the
pressure is high the discharge passes in a series of distinct sparks,
separated by a suf<U+FB01>ciently long interval of time to make each spark
independent of the one preceding it. Here, of course, the spark will
set out from that part of the negative electrode at which the tension
is strongest. As the vessel is gradually exhausted the sparks suc
ceed each other more rapidly, and the molecules decomposed during
one discharge assist the next discharge.      If the decomposition of the
molecules goes on at a suf<U+FB01>ciently rapid rate the tangential action of
which I have spoken comes into play, and the negative glow will
cover a greater part of the negative electrode. The discharge at the
same time can become continuous, for the state of polarisation near
the electrode can keep up a continuous stress.          The stronger the
current becomes, the more easily will the negative electrode become
covered with the glow.

                        The  Dark  Space and Glow.
   I enter now into a more detailed account of the phenomena. which
happen in the neighbourhoood of the negative electrode.           We con
sider   this electrode to be  surrounded   by a layer  of  electro-positive
particles.     The molecules are decomposed partly by chemical and
partly by electrical forces, and the electro-negative part will be able
to follow the forces acting on it, and acquire a considerable velocity
within a small distance. This velocity will gradually be reduced by
impacts, and the temperature thereby raised: hence the luminosity
of the glow.     The dark space must, therefore, be considered as the
region through which the greater number of atoms can freely pass.
But, as already observed, the dark space is itself slightly luminous, as
it should be. We cannot, of course, know anything at present as to
the mean free path of the constituents of the decomposed molecules,
especially as they move in a non-homogeneous atmosphere: traversed
from one side by the molecules coming from the positive pole, and
from the other by the products of decomposition. The chief dif<U+FB01>culty
seems to me to be the explanation of the sharpness of the boundary of
the dark space in certain cases.
   Mr. Goldstein has described some interesting experiments under
the title of
              “ A New Kind of Electrical
                                           Repulsion.”    I think that his
experiments admit of a very simple explanation.        When the glow is
allowed to fall on a screen through which a. small aperture is cut, its
rays are seen to be propagated in straight lines from the aperture.        If
 such a ray passes close to another negative electrode it is de<U+FB02>ected.
 This seems to me to be a necessary consequence of the fact that the
 potential in the neighbourhood of an electrode alters very rapidly,
 and that therefore strong forces must act on a passing particle charged
 with negative electricity.   Mr. Goldstein <U+FB01>nds that as long as the two
 kathodes are metallically connected the e<U+FB01>ect is the same, whatever
the pressure of the gas, whatever the nature of the gas, and whatever
the strength of the current.     All these laws are easily deduced from
 our theory. The velocity is acquired in the immediate neighbourhood
of the negative electrode; if the fall of potential is increased in a
given ratio the square of the velocity is increased in the same ratio,
and throughout the path all the forces are increased also in the same
ratio. Hence the path must be the same, and as neither the amount
 of electricity carried by each particle nor its mass would affect the
 result, the total de<U+FB02>ection of the ray is independent of the nature of
 the gas.
    Goldstein claims to prove that the repulsion is not exerted through
 solid substances like glass or mica, but his experiment admits of a
 better explanation. According to Hittorf we must consider the glow
 to be a good conductor, that is to say, metal wires which are placed

                  Discharge   of Electricity through   Gases.         331
inside the glow readily take up the potential of the surrounding space.
A screen of glass, therefore, in front of an electrode will become
covered with electricity until the potential in its neighbourhood does
not vary in a normal direction, and if the ray from a negative
electrode passes tangentially, there can be no de<U+FB02>ective force on the
particles which make up the ray, the piece of glass will act as an
 electrical screen.   We shall never be able to show for the same reason
any de<U+FB02>ecting force due to a statically charged body, for if the body
is simply placed inside the vacuum, near enough to in<U+FB02>uence the
 current, it will discharge itself, and if it is covered with some non
conductor, that non-conductor will become charged on its outside until
its e<U+FB01>ect on the lines of force has been counterbalanced.
    A serious objection against Mr. Crookes’ view that particles are
projected from the negative electrode with great velocity has been
<U+FB01>rst urged by Mr. E. Wiedemann,             I believe, and was afterwards
repeated by Goldstein.       It would apply with equal force against the
theory which     I  am defending.   Particles moving with great velocity
 in one direction should send out light, the wave-length of which is
 affected by the motion.      No such effect can be observed, although
Goldstein has undoubtedly proved that the velocity must be suf<U+FB01>ciently
 large to make it perceptible. But the particles moving with great
velocity are not themselves luminous, that is proved by the existence
 of the dark space.        It is only when their velocity has become
su<U+FB01>iciently reduced and the energy is distributed in all directions,
 that the particles are luminous; but then we do not get a one-sided
 displacement, but only a very small widening due to the motion of
 the particles in all directions.
    Mr. Crookes has given reasons why we should consider the region
 of the dark space as one in which directed motion prevails, and
although Hittorf has raised serious objections against the arguments
 drawn from his radiometer experiments, which seem to be explained
by secondary temperature effects, the general conclusion which he
 has drawn from his experiments is not thereby invalidated, for the
 rise of temperature itself requires explanation.
                        Proposed Test of the Theory.
    The most conclusive proof of our theory would be the demonstra
 tion of the fact that each particle of matter carries with it the same
 amount of electricity.     We shall not, of course, be able to prove this
                                 I
 for each single particle, but propose to show how we can decide the
 point experimentally as far as the average amount is concerned.
  Suppose a small straight beam is cut out of the glow and placed in a
 <U+FB01>eld of uniform force, the lines of which cut the rays of the glow at
 right angles.     The force being everywhere normal to the rays, these
 will curl up a circle. This has been shown to be true experimentally
               in
    VOL.  xxxvn.                                                z

 332             Dr. A. Schuster.        Experiments    on the
by Hittorf.      I  think a careful measurement of the radii of such
circles will give us important information, and         I  have already made
preliminary experiments       which   have  shown   me   that   such a measure
ment is possible.
   The force exerted on each part of the current is proportional to
oXe, where 'v isthe velocity of each particle, and e the amount of
electricity it carries. If the particle moves in a circle the force is also
                     2
proportional to 1i where      T is the radius of the circle.       Hence  'r must
                   7'
be proportional    to 'u/e.
   Suppose, now, that the current is increased.        This may mean either
that the number of particles carrying the discharge is increased, or
that the velocity of each particle is increased, or that the amount of
electricity is increased, or, <U+FB01>nally, some combined effect of these three
causes.    When we come to consider the positive part of the discharge,
I shall show that the number of particles taking part in the discharge
seems certainly increased by an increasing current, and this is also
evident from the mere appearance of the discharge; this does not,
however, a<U+FB01>ect the in<U+FB02>uence of the magnet.              I  <U+FB01>nd as a result of
experiment that the diameter of the rings is considerably increased
by an increase in strength of the current; hence an increased current
must either mean a larger velocity only, 01', at any rate, a velocity
increasing in a quicker ratio than the amount of electricity carried.
Before going further we must consider in what way ru depends on e.
Let the total fall of potential in the region in which the velocity is
acquired be F, than 1) will vary as the square root of Fe, and hence
the diameter of the       ring will vary    as
                                                M?  e
                                                          If  e  is constant the
diameter of the ring ought to vary as the square root of the fall of
potential in the neighbourhood of the negative electrode.            Here, then,
we have    a de<U+FB01>nite experimental problem        before   us which     I hope to
decide one way or another as soon as           I have the necessary experi
                                                    I
mental means at my disposal. At present wish only to point out
that if e does vary there is every reason that it cannot vary otherwise
on the average than proportionally to F. Hence the diameter of the
ring ought to be independent of the current, which it is not.
                       Experiments with Htttorf’s Tube.
   Mr. Hittorf has described some phenomena which are, in my
opinion, particularly interesting, as putting beyond all reasonable
doubt the projection of particles away from the negative pole.
   The tube, or rather the bulb, which he used had two parallel
electrodes at a distance of only a few millimetres.         It was found that
at very low pressures the discharge from the positive electrode took

                  Discharge    of Electricity through  Gases.           333
place not towards the negative pole, but in the opposite direction.
I have repeated these experiments with electrodes which were
rather further apart. The behaviour of the tube under di<U+FB01>erent
circumstances can be shortly expressed by saying that the discharge
always passes to the nearest point of the inner boundary of the dark
space.     When the exhaustion is not su<U+FB02>icient, so that the width of
the dark space is less than the distance between the electrodes, the
positive discharge takes place towards the negative pole as in the
ordinary tubes, but as the dark space gradually expands, the positive
discharge contracts, and becomes invisible when the dark space comes
into contact with the positive wire. On further reduction of pressure
the dark space reaches beyond the positive pole, and the discharge
passes from that pole to the nearest point of the negative glow.          In
other words, the tube behaves as if the glow, and not the negative
wire, formed the electrode.        But this is exactly what should happen
according     to our theory.
    The negative particles which are projected from the wire have <U+FB01>rst
to be brought to rest by molecular encounters before their motion is
regulated by the electrical forces in the ordinary sense.
    The experiment is conclusive to my mind, because in the neighbour
hood of the positive discharge, as it turns away from the negative
 pole, we have the current <U+FB02>owing in two opposite directions at closely
 adjoining places.      This could not be possible unless the current in
 one   direction   was   carried by particles moving against the lines of
 force by their inertia.      The positive discharge at the lowest pressures
 which   I  am able to obtain shows some curious phenomena, indicating
 perhaps that to some extent the phenomena of the negative pole are
repeated to a much smaller degree at the positive pole.          A dark line
 is noticed parallel to the positive wire at a distance varying with the
 pressure, and at the best exhaustion which I could obtain about
 1 millim. distant from it.         From the wire to the dark line the
 discharge is very narrow, but from the dark line it spreads out fan
like towards the negative glow.
    Fig. 6, Plate 1, is taken from a photograph, and shows the phenomena
 which    I  have just described. As far as the negative glow in these
tubes is concerned, the repulsive forces from the positive pole make
 themselves very perceptible, so that the glow becomes stronger away
from the positive wire, and the tube presents the curious appearance
of two discharges from the two poles tending away from each other
and towards the glass vessel. The current completes itself on the
side of the vessel.      This is clearly shown in a photograph (<U+FB01>g. 7),
which represents a projection in a plane at right angles to the wire
poles.     These poles appear therefore as points, and the two discharges
passing away from each other and joining OVGI‘ the glass are clearly
distinguished.
                                                                z 2

334              Dr. A. Schuster.       Ewperiments 0n the
                E<U+FB02>'ects observed on Reversal of the Current.
    I now pass to a short description of some curious effects observed
on sudden reversal of the current.       In my large vessels in which the
dark area opposite the positive wire appeared, the phenomena seen
when the wire was negative and the cylinder positive present little
that needs mentioning in detail. The only trace of positive light is
con<U+FB01>ned to two yellowish lines running parallel and symmetrical to
the wire.    We have here very likely to deal with the reaction to the
repulsive e<U+FB02>'ect on the glow.      If, when these yellow bands are seen,
the current be slightly interrupted for a short time and passed again
in the same direction, these bands will appear perfectly steady from
the beginning of the passage.       If, however, before making contact in
the same direction, a single spark be passed in the reverse direction,
the two bands will at <U+FB01>rst appear close together and right opposite
 the negative wire, then quickly to move outward and to take up their
<U+FB01>nal position.     If, after the cylinder has been positive, the current is
interrupted for a longer period of time, say <U+FB01>ve minutes, then the
 same e<U+FB01>ects as on reversal will appear.           Thus it seems that a
certain state has been established which dies away in something like
 <U+FB01>ve minutes, but which can also be made to disappear by a single
 spark in the opposite direction.
    Similar e<U+FB01>ects, though not so striking, are observed with the wire
negative. The dark area seems to take time to establish itself. A
 short interruption of the current will make it reappear fully from the
 beginning, but if either <U+FB01>ve minutes are allowed to lapse, or a spark
in the opposite direction is passed through the vessel, the dark area
will not be well developed to begin with, but is <U+FB01>lled with a faint
 glow which, however, dies away rapidly.          These phenomena are,    I
  think, fully in accordance with the theory here suggested, for it is
 clear that the condenser action will take time to establish itself and
 to die away, just as in a liquid. The effects observed when the
 cylinder is positive are not, in my opinion, produced by such a
 condenser action at the positive pole, but are secondary effects
  depending on the changes in the glow. When the current is <U+FB01>nally
  established, the glow will be strongest away from the cylinder, and
  the positive discharge will consequently set out from parts of the
  cylinder not directly opposite the negative electrode. Hittorf has
  already noticed that when the negative electrode consisted of a long
  wire, the glow was found on <U+FB01>rst making contact to start from the
  point and to run backwards, covering gradually the whole of the
  wire.   This is perhaps the place to dispose of an objection which
  might be raised against the theory. There are apparently no
                                                                       I

the action    which takes place at the poles in an electrolyte as a
condenser action, and we can calculate from the measured capacity of
the condenser the distance between the two charges of electricity.
In the case of liquids, this distance is extremely small, and is given
by Helmholtz in his Faraday lecture as the ten-millionth part of a
millimetre.      Though the total fall of potential in a gas which is
measured by' the moment of the condenser might be the same as, or
even much stronger than in the liquid, the charges might easily escape
detection, if the distance between the layers is say ten thousand
times larger in the gas than in the liquid.        The phenomenon of the
dark area tends to argue in favour of a greater thickness of the
region between which the condenser action takes place.
                      The Positive Part of the Discharge.
    I cannot enter in the present paper fully into the phenomena which
 happen in the positive part of the discharge. It is too early as yet,    I
 think, to form a distinct idea as to how the electricity is conveyed in
 the manifold forms which the discharge seems able to take. But a
 few remarks may not be out of place to show that we meet with
 nothing that is contradictory to the theory which I have put forward.
 A remarkable result obtained in different ways by Hittorf and by
 E. Wiedemann is on the contrary rather in its favour. Hittorf has
 found that the fall of potential in that part of the tube which we have
 for convenience’ sake called the positive half, is independent of the
 intensity of the current passing through it. This means that the
 current into the resistance is a constant quantity for a given tube and
 pressure, or in other words, that the energy dissipated is directly
 proportional to the current, and not to the square of the current as in
 a metallic conductor.        It had, indeed, been found previously by
 E. Wiedemann that the heat developed in a series of discharges is
 proportional to the quantity of electricity which has passed through
  the tube, and independent of the fact whether that quantity has
  passed in a few strong sparks or in a greater number of weaker ones.
  This fact seems to point to the conclusion that in the positive part of
  the discharge a greater intensity of current only means that a greater
  number of particles takes part in the discharge, but that the velocity
  of diffusion of the particles carrying the discharge is independent of
  the intensity of the current.
     With regard to the strati<U+FB01>cations,        I should offer the following
  preliminary explanation, but only with the view of showing that the
  theory is capable of dealing with these phenomena. In the <U+FB01>rst place
  strati<U+FB01>cations are seen at their best with compound gases, and also
  with mixtures of gases which are likely to form compounds. That
  the decomposed particles at the negative pole are liable to form

336               Dr. A. Schuster.    Experiments   on the
compounds is shown by the peculiar spectrum of the glow in many
gases.     Such a compound will behave as an electri<U+FB01>ed molecule, and
travel towards the positive pole, the fall of potential will increase its
velocity, and that will again be reduced by molecular encounter, the
heat thus generated will possibly decompose the molecule again; we
have then two ways in which the discharge can be carried, either by
the electri<U+FB01>ed molecules or by the decomposed atoms. If, owing to
some reason, the decomposing of molecules takes place at de<U+FB01>nite
places in the tube instead of being distributed unequally throughout
the tube, we have what practically becomes a secondary negative pole
with its dark space. There is much to be said in favour of the view
that the intervals between two strati<U+FB01>cations are due to the same
causes which produce the dark space at the negative electrode.         It is
needless at present to speculate      on the original cause which <U+FB01>xes
the positions of these secondary poles.
     I  can see nothing antagonistic to our views in the secondary
negative poles discovered by Goldstein to exist wherever the width of
the tube rapidly widens in the direction from the negative to the
positive electrode.
            The In<U+FB02>uence of the Magnet on the Electric Discharge.
     The in<U+FB02>uence of the magnet on the electric discharge is generally
 supposed to be well understood, but a good deal yet remains to be
 said on the matter, for although we can in each individual case trace
 out pretty well why a certain eifect happens, it is yet impossible,
 according to the results given hitherto, to predict beforehand the
 behaviour of a vacuum tube in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld.
      The magnetic in<U+FB02>uence on the positive part of the discharge is
 either compared to the e<U+FB01>ect on an elastic thread carrying a current,
 or looked on as an effect on particles projected with great velocities
 from the positive pole.      I do not think that either of these views
 gives a correct representation of the matter.
      Let us compare for a moment the effects which are observed when
  a magnet acts on currents passing through liquids and gases.         Sup
 posing a liquid cell is placed equatorially in a magnetic <U+FB01>eld, strong
  movements of the liquid are observed, yet the lines of <U+FB02>ow of elec
  tricity seem to be unchanged.      I consider that the <U+FB01>rst effect of the
  magnet    on a  current through  a  gas is exactly the same; but then
  comes the difference.   The particles of the gas which have carried the
  discharge conduct better than those which have not, and consequently
  the spark continues to pass through the particles which have been
  thrown aside by the magnet; that is to say, the current becomes            '
  de<U+FB02>ected.    As the current continues it will become de<U+FB02>ected further
  and further, yet there will be a tendency to fall back into the original
   line of least resistance. The <U+FB01>nal form of the discharge will there

                    Discharge   of Electricity through     Gases.           337
 fore not   be one of equilibrium, but a compromise between the con
 tinuous rotation which the magnet tends to set up and the tendency
 to choose the path of least resistance. There is a real difference
 between this view and that generally brought forward; for, if            I  am
 correct, we should have in the <U+FB01>nal stage, which to us seems to be one
 of equilibrium, the particles of the gas carried through the current in
 a direction at right angles to it.
      I              I
        think that may quote the. experiments of De la Rive on the
 rotation of a current round a magnet in support of what I have said.
 I  have repeated his experiments by using a vessel very similar to
 those previously described: the inner cylinder contained the pole
 piece of a strong magnet, and was not used as electrode.           One of the
 electrodes was a ring surrounding the axis; the other, a wire in the
 direction of the axis of the magnet. It has already been pointed out
 by De la Rive that the experiment is not successful with air; there
 seems a tendency towards rotation, but no rotation.            Here, then, the
 preponderance      of  conductivity    of  the  particles which  have already
 carried the discharge does not seem suf<U+FB01>cient to rotate the current;
yet we cannot imagine that, for the same intensity of current. the
 effect of the magnet should not be the same.              We must conclude,
 therefore,   that  here  the particles   are  driven through the current, but
 do not carry the current with them. Even with vapours like alcohol,
 with which a continuous rotation can be obtained, it often happens
that the current rotates only through a small angle, then suddenly
jumps back into its original lines, and then tries to go round for some
 time, until it <U+FB01>nally succeeds.           Those who are familiar with the
 experiments     of  Pliicker  will  <U+FB01>nd,    I think, that they can easily be
explained by what       I  have said, but that in no case can the form in
which the discharge takes place be one of equilibrium; nor is it even
a circle, which is the curve in which a <U+FB02>exible wire carrying the
current would set if it was <U+FB01>xed at both ends.
    As far as the effect of the magnet on the negative glow is con
cerned, it is generally considered suf<U+FB01>cient to say that it sets in
magnetic lines of force, or sometimes that it winds itself in spirals
round those lines. The facts are true, and easily explained by any
theory of projection, but they do not contain the whole truth.
    In order to understand fully the action of the magnet, we have to
be careful in distinguishing two totally distinct questions.          The <U+FB01>rst
question is this : In what way does the magnet affect the rays of the
glow which start from any given part of the negative electrode ? This
question has been satisfactorily answered by means of the theory of
projection.     The second question, which has not received suf<U+FB01>cient
attention, is this: At what parts of a negative electrode placed in
magnetic <U+FB01>eld does the glow form itself? For we <U+FB01>nd that large
parts of a kathode sometimes remain absolutely dark in a. magnetic

<U+FB01>eld, while they are covered with a glow on removal of magnetisa
                                                 >
tion.
   I  have found the following explanation satisfactory in accounting
for the phenomena observed by me or recorded by others.             Suppose
the whole negative electrode to be covered with the glow and then
placed into the magnetic <U+FB01>eld. The negatively charged particles will
be de<U+FB02>ected in their path, and at some times they will tend to sepa
rate, at others they will be thrown together.       Where they are thrown
together the temperature will rise, and the discharge will pass more
freely, and the current here will be strengthened, and the tempera
ture still further increased. There is then, <U+FB01>nally, a tendency of the
glow to settle down exclusively at those places at which, owing to the
effect of the magnet, the particles are thrown together.           If in the
vessel (<U+FB01>g. 1)    a small  electromaguet    is  introduced  into  the inner
cylinder with its axis at right angles to the axis of the cylinder, it is
found that the parts of the aluminium foil covering the two poles of
the magnet are absolutely dark (<U+FB01>g. 8, Plate 1).         It is clear that, if
there was any glow at    these  parts, the  particles carrying the current
would be driven asunder, while they are thrown together near the
middle parts of the magnet, where consequently the glow becomes
strongest.
   If into the same vessel we place a magnet longitudinally, the e<U+FB01>ect
is that observed in <U+FB01>g. 9.       Here again the glow settles round the
centre of the magnet. The electromagnet used in this last experi
ment had a length of 8 centims., so that it <U+FB01>lled completely the
aluminium cylinder.      That the question here introduced as to the
parts of the kathode at which the glow chie<U+FB02>y settles is distinct from
the more direct effect of the magnet on the glow, once that glow is
formed, is clearly shown in cases where the vessel contains two nega
tive electrodes, one of which only is affected by the magnet.         I have
used, for instance, a vessel containing          two aluminium cylinders
 opposite each other.   If a magnet is introduced into one of them, the
glow will sometimes be taken away entirely from the other cylinder;
a fact easily explained by the greater facility of the formation of the
glow where the temperature is increased by a concentration                 of
particles.
   Fig. 9 also shows a curious e<U+FB01>ect of the magnet on the width of
the dark space. Where the glow is strongest the dark space is very
narrow, while it is widened wherever the glow is weak.          It has been
proved by Crookes     that  the  dark  space becomes narrower when the
intensity of the current is increased, and the effect shown in the
photograph is a simple consequence of this fact.
   I  have been during the whole of this investigation very ably assisted
by  Mr.                                        I

to overcome the great practical di<U+FB01>iculties which present themselves

                              I. Preliminary    Remarks.
   On   a previous occasion*    I  had the honour to present to the Royal     .
Society    some   results of an investigation           made about electrical
conductivity of chemical compounds, and I then chie<U+FB02>y examined the
lique<U+FB01>ed gases, pointing them out as very bad conductors.             I  have
since been engaged in studying another property of these substances,
and   I  have succeeded in determining in an experimental way their
refractive   power.     As in England and abroad several papers have
been subsequently published bearing on the relation between the
liquid and gaseous conduction of matter, and especially lique<U+FB01>ed
gases present themselves well adapted to this kind of research, I hope
the Royal Society will consider my paper not devoid of interest, the
more so because our knowledge of their physical constants is some
what limited.      And though we possess numerous determinations of
the refractive power of a vast number of chemical compounds, still
increasing daily,   I have found only very little information concerning
my subject, this being limited to sulphurons and prussic acid, that
 are readily lique<U+FB01>ed by cold and present no dif<U+FB01>culty in manipulating.
 Faraday in his extensive paper on lique<U+FB01>ed gases, published in 1823,
 when describing the properties of several of them, compares only
 their index of refraction to that of water, calling it more or less, and
 Brewster in 1826 mentioned in a communication to the Society of
 Edinburgh the index of refraction of lique<U+FB01>ed cyanogen as 1316,
 but without any remarks on the manner in which it was deduced.
    I                                                           I
      will commence this paper by describing the method followed to
 obtain the numerical values of the index of refraction of several
 gases, lique<U+FB01>ed either by pressure or by cold, and that enabled me to
 surmount the di<U+FB01>iculties resulting from high tensions and small
 quantities of <U+FB02>uid substance, that may perhaps have kept back other
 experimenters from this <U+FB01>eld of research.

340       Dr. L. Bleekrode.      On the Determination    of the
                    II. Description of  the Apparatus.
   Several methods are now at command in physics by which the
index of refraction may be determined even to the sixth decimal, yet
in this peculiar case, from the very conditions in which the liquids
were to be examined, it was not safe to employ prisms having glass
walls cemented on, as cements are often soluble in the lique<U+FB01>ed
gases; besides rather great dimensions would have been required,
rendering the e<U+FB01>ect of pressure the more di<U+FB01>icult to resist.
   As in my former investigation,     I   chose again in most cases the
Faraday tubes, but I had them modi<U+FB01>ed in the proper way, so as to
obtain the liquid inclosed between parallel glass sides, when   I could
apply themicroscope to make quantitative experiments.
   After many preliminary arrangements that were successively tried
I  came to an equally eifective and simple construction, that showed
itself most convenient and is represented in <U+FB01>gs. 1 and 2, and I
suppose it may prove useful also in other researches with lique<U+FB01>ed
gases.    A section of the apparatus is given in <U+FB01>g. 1; it con
sists of a short glass cylinder a (length 15 millims., inner diameter
3 millims., outer diameter 11 millims.), communicating on both sides

  with capillary        tubes 11 and c; this was transformed into a vessel
  having two parallel side plates, and free from leakage even at high
  pressures, in the following manner.
      The ends of the cylinder were both ground as <U+FB02>at as possible, on
  each of them a thin circular disk pierced in the centre and cut from
  lead or tin, according to the liquid examined, was put, subsequently
  a plane glass plate that had been previously submitted                       to the
  toughening process          of La   Bastide    (in some   cases  a quartz  disk  was
  used) followed, and lastly a perforated smooth leathern disk. The
. whole was held together by two perforated steel plates forming the
  ends (<U+FB01>g. 1 shows the construction, 6 and 9 showing the apertures)
  and connected with another by three screws turned on as strongly as
  possible) A perfectly gas-tight vessel was thus obtained that did
  not allow leakages even at pressures above a hundred atmospheres, as
  was tried with the compression apparatus of Cailletet.                  And  I  must
  point out here especially the property of toughened glass to resist in
  the most effective way the always more or less unequal pressure,
   exerted by the three .connecting screws, when even quartz plates
  being 3 millims. thick burst to pieces, if the screws happened to be
   turned on unequally.          The glass plates, having only a thickness of
   1 to 1'5 millims., were cut out of very plane surfaces, and after being
   reduced to the proper dimensions, suifered the toughening operation,
   that was applied with much care.            Of course some of them got their
   surface more or less impaired and rendered less transparent; from a
   great number the best ones were chosen, and they never became un<U+FB01>t
   for   use.                                          _
      In most      cases the lead disks, procuring        a very successful closing,
   were not attacked in a chemical way by the lique<U+FB01>ed substance if no
   moisture accompanied it (with hydrobromic acid tin disks resisted
   better), and thus commonly a perfectly clear liquid <U+FB01>lled the
    cylindrical vessele In how effective a way leakages were prevented
    may be concluded from the fact that liquid carbonic acid was often
    kept during more than a year in such hermetically closed vessels, and
    even when heated during several hours above 30° C., without a
    perceptible loss occurring.
       If the gas could be evolved chemically in a suf<U+FB01>cient quantity to
    become liquid by its own pressure exerted, the cylindrical vessel was
    <U+FB01>xed with the blowpipe on a stout bent glass tube (<U+FB01>g. 2), having a
    length generally of 40 centims., an inner diameter of 6 millims., an outer
    diameter ofle millims.           The appropriate substances were put in the
      i“  The steel plates were 8 millims. thick; in the <U+FB01>gure only two screws could be
    represented  entirely.
       1' Organic  substances, applied to obtain a gas-tight closure, should be avoided
    when working with apparatus for lique<U+FB01>ed gas, as these are commonly absorbed by
    the liquids, rendering them often opaque.

                    Index of Refraction of Lique<U+FB01>ed           Gases.               343
lower part of the tube, in the upper one some compounds <U+FB01>t to absorb
any moisture present in the evolved gas, and both ends sealed with
the blowpipe.           Afterwards the substances were put in contact by
gently shaking         the tube, and the operation conducted so as to have
the lique<U+FB01>ed gas distilling over into the vessel, directed with its axis
in a horizontal position. Enough liquid was always obtained to <U+FB01>ll
it completely and generally also the connected capillary tubes on both
sides, and no gas or air remained ; the small dimensions of this part
of the apparatus caused some drops of liquid to be su<U+FB02>icient. The
liquefying operation conducted with the Cailletet pump proceeded in
the usual way; the capillary part b (<U+FB01>g. 1) of the vessel was <U+FB01>xed with
the blowpipe on the ordinary gas tube of this apparatus, the other
capillary part c was closed after this tube was <U+FB01>lled with the puri<U+FB01>ed
gas.
    If  the gas could be put readily into the liquid condition with the
aid of low temperatures, the cylindrical vessel was put on a doubly
bent glass tube, and this surrounded by a freezing mixture; this was
applied in the case of sulphurous acid, some amine compounds, &0.
               I
    Lastly, will observe, that after terminating a series of experiments
with some gas, the whole apparatus could be liberated from its
contents by cutting o<U+FB01> a _very small part of the lower end of the tube,
and all remaining substances were removed by the pressure of the
gas; thus        I could afterwards examine the glass disks and convince
myself whether the lique<U+FB01>ed gases, being perhaps not pure, had left
behind some moisture or other deposits.
                           III.  The Method of Observation.
    The reason why          I  had to provide for getting the lique<U+FB01>ed gas
inclosed between parallel glass plates was to have an Opportunity to
 apply the microscope, which perhaps may be the only practical effec
 tive method under these circumstances.                  _
    The use of this instrument in determining the index of refraction
 was <U+FB01>rst proposed by the Duke de Chaulnes in 1767, but the exacti
 tude of the results being limited to the third decimal (from the
 principle on which the method is based) it is inferior to many other
 methods, and was, of course, neglected in physics<U+FB01>“ The mathe
 matical expression for the index that has to be used in this case
 follows from very simple considerations.
    * In 1849 Bel-tin published some modi<U+FB01>cations of this method, without improving,
 however,   its exactitude, as appears from the values communicated for the index of
 glass (1'497 and 1'703), the goniometer giving 1'507 and 1f696.
    More recently, in 1876, Royston Pigott, when describing his refractometer, com
 mented on adapting his instrument to the microscopical method, and in 1878
 Mr.  Sorby, of Shef<U+FB01>eld, made several valuable and interesting communications       on
 the refractive indices of minerals, which were determined with the microscope, and
 he also pointed out the practical use in the case of small quantities of liquids.

344          Dr. L. Bleekrode.          On the Determination     of the
    Suppose in <U+FB01>g. 3 a liquid layer of a certain thickness limited by
parallel surfaces, its refractive power shall be such that any object
placed in b will be seen apparently in 0; hence the relation—
                              db_tani___sini_
                              do    tan'r    sinr
when the angles of incidence and refractiOn are very small, calling
the thickness of the layer D, and the apparent displacement of 12:01,
the equation is obtained—
                                     n=l  D—d’
which gives       the value      of    the  index   by measuring      two   linear
dimensions.
     Practically the case is not so very simple as is supposed, because
the terminal glass plates, transmitting the rays, contribute to the dis
placement, as is shown in <U+FB01>g. 4. The effect caused by these two
disks together I call the glass e<U+FB02>fect,” and it had to be determined
                               “
for each vessel itself before it was <U+FB01>lled with liquid ; the amount was
afterwards deducted as a constant correction.              In <U+FB01>g. 4 the vessel is
 represented by     abdc,  and   it  is  obvious  that  the  rays, which can be
transmitted through       the  liquid    under the  greatest angle of refraction,
have a direction along ac, when they will pass through the apertures
 in the centre of the steel plates laid on at and out.
     In the greater part of experiments, ab and cd measured 20 and 21
 millims. respectively; the angle of refraction deduced from its tangent
 will not surpass a value of 5?, and therefore the error, caused by
 taking the sine instead of the tangent, only amounts to one unit in
 the third decimal.
     The numerical values for D and d are easily obtained with the aid
 of the microscope, which was specially constructed for my purpose
 by Nachet of Paris.       The ocular tube (that in most observations was
 placed   in a horizontal   direction) was provided with a vernier, moving
 along a scale divided in halves of a millimetre, and allowing to deter
 mine a displacement of the tube to 5% millim.; a micrometer screw
 could also be used for a more accurate adjustment to the 1—176 millim.
 Of course, the exactitnde that may be reached in focussing any object
 depends on the magnifying power applied; unfortunately,                   I   was
 limited in using very high powers by the necessary dimensions
 required by the glass cell to be strong enough and <U+FB01>t to the end in
  view.   I chose a high magnifying ocular power and a very feeble objec
  tive lens, getting by this combination a magnifying power of nearly 30 ;
 it gave the advantage of having very well-de<U+FB01>ned and clear images
  to focus on of microscopic test-objects—as, for instance, the scales of
  wings of Lepidoptera <U+FB01>xed on the glass plates of the cell merely by
  adhesion on the inner surfaces. When the cell was constructed,                 I

                   Index of Refraction 0f Lique<U+FB01>ed                 Gases.            345
began with determining its height, putting it before the objective lens
of the microscope, and focussing <U+FB01>rst the objects on one of the glass
plates, then those on the other; taking now the di<U+FB02>ference between
the two readings the value of D was obtained.                    I  remark that in this
way    the  e<U+FB01>'ect of the    front  glass plate (next       to the   objective lens) and
also of absolute errors in the division of the scale and micrometer
screw were eliminated.           Putting successively the tube on other parts
of the scale,   I  could take a range of readings numbering six or eight,
from which the mean value was deduced.
    The determination of d, the apparent displacement, was somewhat
more complicated, a part of it being caused by the refraction of the
glass walls of the cell, and this was to be <U+FB01>rst ascertained.                  I found it
most convenient for this purpose to have                 the   objects    to be focussed
not on the glass plates of the cell, but on a separate glass slide placed
immediately behind it; otherwise in taking di<U+FB01>'erent readings, when
                                        I
working with a lique<U+FB01>ed gas, should have had the cell to be alter
nately <U+FB01>lled and emptied again.                  Yet the deduced mathematical
expression may also be used in this modi<U+FB01>ed case. Considering in
<U+FB01>g. 3 an object      f   placed beyond the cell to be focussed through it,
either empty or <U+FB01>lled, then, by the effect of refraction, it will be seen
apparently in e,- and when the angle fba is very small<U+FB01>" abf will be
almost a straight line, and again the equation is obtained—
                                 mf_db___        D
                                 117e—d—o   —m_"'
    Therefore, when a complete observation of n for any lique<U+FB01>ed gas
was to be made, a glass slide with test-objects was placed in front of
the microscope, the glass cell still empty (whose height had been
previously ascertained) followed close to it, and, putting the tube of
the microscope in a horizontal position,               I   focussed the objects <U+FB01>rst
through the cell, then, moving this aside,                I  focussed again; a set of
such observations gave the mean e<U+FB02>ect of both glass plates of the cell
together.      Now the lique<U+FB01>ed gas was prepared in the glass tube con
                                  I
nected with the cell, and took great care to have it completely <U+FB01>lled
without any remaining gas-bubbles.                  I obtained this easily enough,
when maintaining          the  axis  of  the  cell in a  horizontal direction.
                                                                 I
    To get the index of refraction of the liquid, focussed through it
the test-objects;      I  determined the position on the scale of the micro
scope,    corrected   it   for the glass eEect, as described; moving the cell
aside, I focussed again the test-objects directly; the difference be
 tween the former and the latter reading gave the value of d, and the
 height or D being already known, n is calculated.                       This method is
 dependent on the condition              that  the   cell   is  provided with parallel
    * With the greatest value of the angle of refraction, 5?, and with an index of
 refraction ranging between 1‘2 and 1'8, the obtuse angle amounts to 178°‘9.

glass plates themselves might have been very parallel, yet by a more
or less unequal compression of the intermediate leathern and leaden
disks, a somewhat prismatic form of cell could have ensued. Whether

  The light employed for the determination was that from a Bunsen’s

13599 at 8° and 13521 at 21°, leading by interpolation to 13569 at

    The determinations from the correct values are within the limits of
 the probable error, and          I must observe that even with very accurate
 methods, attaining four decimals, the results given by different                       ‘
 experimenters vary in the third decimal, for instance, with sulphuric
 ether at 15°, Gladstone and Dale found the index (D line) 1'3566;

    I will   now proceed to give the results of the experiments bearing
 on several lique<U+FB01>ed gases, and made as described above.                      Therefore
 I think it sul<U+FB01>cient, after the foregoing explanations, to give for each
 gas the <U+FB01>nal results for the values of D, d, and in, these having the
 same signi<U+FB01>cation as in the former chapter.                   Yet I must add that
                                          I
 during a space of four years repeated at different times the deter
 minations for each gas with di<U+FB01>erent vessels; in this way the number
 of single observations has amounted to, some thousands, consisting of
 series of six or eight terms.               I  commonly employed as source of
 light the <U+FB02>ame of a Bunsen gas-burner, containing a piece of woven
 asbestos, moistened with a solution of natrium chloride, and pro
 ducing an excellent monochromatic light. Sometimes                     I  also experi
 mented with ordinary daylight; this was necessitated by some calcu
lations, as will be seen in the next chapter.

    The gas was prepared in the usual way, and lique<U+FB01>ed in a tube con.

(1:403 millims., n=1'350    at 15°, with daylight n=1'357 at 13°.
   The index of refraction of the easily lique<U+FB01>ed gas was already
determined by Ketteler in 1865 with a goniometer, and he found the
value of n for the D line=1'3384 at 24°; more recently Bichat“
observed n=l'34Ai at 18°‘5. It may be deduced from these quantities
that this quantity changes nearly O'OOl for one degree of change in
the temperature;      if,

   The gas was prepared by decomposing the cyanide of mercury by
well-dried sulphuretted hydrogen (it had been led through anhydrous
phosphoric acid), and condensing with a freezing mixture in the glass
cell. It was thus obtained extremely pure, as      showed no alteration

 was done by Faraday,       as these always exploded.      The compression
 pump of Cailletet, therefore, was extremely useful in this case, and        I
 applied it with its glass tube modi<U+FB01>ed as described in the former
 chapter.     Enough liquid was produced to <U+FB01>ll the cell at the top
 completely at a pressure of nearly sixty atmospheres; a series of
 observations taken in 1879 led to D=16'34i millims., with natrium
 light d=2‘64 millims., 'n=1‘193 at 16°, with daylight       n:   1196, also
 at 16°. Later on, in 1883, when controlling my former experiments
 with another glass cell, I found D=15'56 millims., with natrium light
 d=2'53 millims., and n=1'194 at 15°, with daylight n=1'198.
 These results are almost identical.
                     5. Phosphoretted  Hydrogen (PHa).
    The liquefaction of this gas was also readily effected with the aid
 of the Cailletet pump. It was prepared from a mixture of phos
phonium iodide and a weak solution of potash<U+FB02>“ evolving by their
 reaction a thoroughly pure gas; at a pressure of about thirty atmo_
 spheres a perfectly clear liquid <U+FB01>lled the glass cells.
    The experiments gave D=15'11 millims., with natrium light
 d=3'64: millims., n=1'317, at the temperature 17°‘5 with daylight
 n=1'323 at 11°.
                      6. Suhihuretted Hydrogen (HQS).
    A series of observations was taken in 1879 with the aid of the
compression pump, and the following values on experimenting with
the lique<U+FB01>ed substance ensued :—D=15‘25 millims., with natrium
light d=4r19 millims., n=1'380 at a temperature of 12°'5.
                I
   -Later on repeated the experiments, using the faradaic tube, and
lique<U+FB01>ed the gas by its own pressure.       I  obtained D=15'77 millims.,
d=4'38 millims., with natrium light air-1384: at 18°‘5, with daylight
n=1'390 at the same temperature.          Instead of leaden disks tinfoil
was applied to obtain a perfectly closed vessel, and to prevent any

chemical reaction.
                        7. Hydrochloric Acid   (HCl).
    This gas was evolved in a suitable bent glass tube from a mixture
of ammonia chloride and strong sulphuric acid; the very little gas
bubbles (evolved under increasing pressure exerted by the gas itself)
had to pass, of course, through a long column of this acid, and were
thus deprived of any moisture.          The lique<U+FB01>ed gas did not at all
attack the leaden disks used between the glass plates of the cell.
    The observations led to D=14r04 millims., with the natrium light
1!:2'81 millims., n=1'252 at 16°‘5.         Another set of observations

  Were    made   with the   gas,  lique<U+FB01>ed with the Cailletet pump, and
  gave similar results. I found D=15'10 millims., with natrium light
  (1:3'06 millims., n=1'254 at 10°, with daylight n=l'257, also
  at 10°.
                         8. Hydrobromic    Acid (HBr).
     As mercury is attacked either by     the gas or  liquid I could not avail
  myself of the Cailletet apparatus in this case, and on this occasion
  the faradaic tubes served very well. I obtained great quantities of
  lique<U+FB01>ed gas from a. mixture of moist potassium bromide and a small
  quantity of red phosphorus, separated by a para<U+FB02>ine stopper from
  a column of liquid bromine put in subsequently.            The gas evolved
  passed through      granulated zinc (to combine with any bromine
  vapours) and through calcium chloride, and condensed afterwards
  into the glass cell as a colourless liquid.      Tin disks were also here
  applied for perfect closure, yet were slightly attacked by the lique<U+FB01>ed
I
  gas.    The determinations led to D=16'08 millims., with the natrium
  light d=3'95 millims., n=1'325 at 10°, and with daylight n=1'330,
  also at 15°.
                            9. Hydriodio   Acid (HI).
     This gas was lique<U+FB01>ed in a similar way as above, it being evolved
  from a moist mixture of red phosphorus iodide and potassium iodide
  (in a <U+FB01>xed proportion).
      The observations led to D=15'68 millims., with natrium light
  d=4'99 millims., 111:1‘466 at 16"5.
                               10. Chlorine  (Cl).
      Here also only the bent glass tube could serve, as mercury would
   not have suffered the contact of the gas without combining with- it.
   I prepared it from a mixture of pyrolusite and hydrochloric acid
   by gently heating and purifying the evolved gas by a long column
   of pyrolusite and calcium chloride that would absorb some hydro
   chloric acid and moisture escaped at the same time with the gas, thus
   a perfectly transparent and bright yellow liquid was obtained.
      The observations led to D=15'30 millims., with natrium light
   d=4‘11 millims., n=1'367 at 14°.
                           11. Carbonic   Acid (COQ).
      I paid peculiar care to obtain as accurate as possible the index of
   refraction of this liquid substance that has been studied in various
  ways. I soon became aware in preliminary experiments that the
  temperature had more in<U+FB02>uence than in the other investigations, as
   might be expected from the circumstance that the critical temperature
   of liquid carbonic acid is not very far above the surrounding tempera
  ture.    I preferred therefore the liquefaction in a bent tube by its own

                   Index of Refraction of Lique<U+FB01>ed Gases.                       353
compression to the Cailletet apparatus, because the heat generated in
becoming liquid lasts longer than with the other method, where it
was always kept ready in liquid state.           Another disturbing in<U+FB02>uence           '
is exerted by some residual air in contact with liquid carbonic acid;
discordant results led me to the fact that near to the critical tempera
ture it becomes a very good solvent to air, and the index is then
much lowered. The gas was evolved in the tube from a mixture of
ammonia bicarbonate and strong nitric acid, and had to pass through
calcium chloride before entering into the glass cell.                 I expelled the
air as far as possible with an air-pump and allowing a little reaction
between the ingredients a certain quantity of carbonic acid gas was
liberated, which, pouring out from the capillary tube at the end of the
cell, <U+FB01>lled remaining interstices and expelled remanent air, while the
tube was sealed.
    From numerous series of observations obtained during the last
years,    I   communicate the following numbers taken with different
 tubes   :—

    It is evident that tube having some air included, and                   II being
 nearly free from air, the di<U+FB01>erence between the values at the same
 temperature is increasing as this becomes higher (the difference is
 greater than the probable error).         It also appears in this table how
 the index is very sensibly affected by changes of temperature; this
 in<U+FB02>uence is already marked in the second decimal, and the more as
 the critical temperature is approached.* .
    ‘  The in<U+FB02>uence of the temperature on the index of refraction of lique<U+FB01>ed     car
 bonic acid, and the changes occurring near and above the critical temperature,   will
 probably form the subject of my next communication.

                           12. Ammonia          (H3N) .
   I  prepared this gas in its liquid condition in the most convenient
way by <U+FB01>lling atube with strongly dried granulated calcium chloride ;
whilst a current of pure ammonia gas was passing through it for some
time, the gas became copiously absorbed, and the <U+FB01>lled tube served
afterwards, by means of a moderate heat, to deliver a large quantity
of gas in the glass cell, connected with the tube, which by its own
compression became liquid.
   The experiments gave D=15‘78 millims., and with the natrium
light d=3'87 millims., n=1'325 at the temperature of 16°‘5, and with
daylight n=1'331 at 16°'5.           I turned my attention to some amine
compounds, which are in chemical properties similar to ammonia, and
are prepared from it by substitution.
   Among them only mcthylamine requires liquefaction, as it boils at
—-4°, and the liquefaction is easily effected by means of a freezing
mixture, which is also desirable, when working with dimethylamine
and trimethylamine, having boiling points respectively at 9° and
9°‘3.   I- ordered these compounds from the renowned chemical
                                                       I
workshops of Kahlbaum at Berlin, whence received them in sealed
glass tubes, and they were distilled in proper bent tubes connected as
usual with the parallel-sided glass cells.
   I  obtained with the natrium light—
                                                    n.               Temp.

             Trimethylamine, CngN           . .   1 '353   . . . .    16
    The   determination of the index for other amines presents no
 peculiar interest, as their boiling point is high enough to admit the
 ordinary methods of observation.
                            13. Ethylene (0211,).
    The history of the liquefaction of this gas is somewhat curious.           It
 was already lique<U+FB01>ed in 1845 by Faraday               on application of both in
 creased pressure and low temperatures (42 atmospheres at -—1°), but
 as the notion of critical temperature was then not fully understood, it
 remained unobserved for this gas, though it is very easily obtained.
 In 1880 Amagat* published an experimental veri<U+FB01>cation of Boyle’s
 law for this gas, and my compatriot, Professor v. d. Waals of
 Amsterdam, deduced        on theoretical grounds from the results
 obtained the critical temperature of liquid ethylene, and had it

 Rendus," 1880, t. 91.

                  Index of Refraction of Lique<U+FB01>ed Gases.                       355
con<U+FB01>rmed actually by experiment as 9°‘2. In 1882 Cailletet‘ con
structed a special apparatus to prepare liquid ethylene in great
quantities, and pointed it out as a means of obtaining a much lower
degree of cold than was possible before, and this opened the way for
the liquefaction of oxygen and hydrogen.
    For my purpose        I  prepared readily a suf<U+FB01>cient quantity of the
lique<U+FB01>ed gas with the ordinary compression pump of Cailletet, taking
care to use a very pure gas obtained in the usual way.                I collected
the liquid in a tube divided in calibrated parts, and could thus
determine the speci<U+FB01>c gravity at di<U+FB02>r'erent temperatures after the
method described by Ansdell,1' and applied by him to liquid
hydrochloric acid and acetylene. My experiments gave at 8° 0335,
at 6°, 0361, at 3°, 0'386. For acetylene Ansdell observes that its
speci<U+FB01>c gravity being 0'450 at 0°, it is the lightest <U+FB02>uid substance
known; it is surpassed in this regard by liquid ethylene, that has
now to be considered as such.
    A second tube provided at one end with the parallel-sided vessel
 already described, at the other end with a specially constructed iron
connecting piece,1'_ and stopcock cemented on the tube, served for
observation of the index of refraction.          After the column of mercury in
the pump had driven the lique<U+FB01>ed gas into the vessel, the stopcock
was <U+FB01>rmly screwed down, and now the tube with its contents could
be removed from the apparatus, and was always ready for observation.
Determinations of the index of liquid ethylene could only be made of
course when the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere was
below 9°‘2; I had them in free air, but the winter being very mild
              I
this year, had no opportunity to observe below 5°. The eifect of a
slight variation of temperature on the refraction is much more
marked than with carbonic acid, as was to be expected, and renders
an exact result rather dif<U+FB01>cult.         I  obtained under satisfactory condi
tions n=1'180 for daylight at 6°.

value as given by v. d. Waals.

and is constructed also by Ducretet, at Paris. It is very accurately wrought.      I
kept for more than ten days the liquid ethylene at a pressure from sixty to seventy
atmospheres without perceptible     leakage, in a tube having the stopcock turned
 down.

Lorentz of the Leyden University have introduced the term the con

pendent of dispersion and temperature, and does not vary whether the
substance is solid, liquid, or gaseous; n and d represent the index of
refraction and the speci<U+FB01>c gravity.                    Many years ago very extensive
and important observations of Gladstone and Dale, Landolt, Wiillner,
were applied to the empirically established relation C=(n— 1)/d, and
they pointed out, that though wanting any theoretical basis, yet it
agrees with the results of experiment and ful<U+FB01>ls to some extent the
conditions of the former expression. Especially has this relation been
used in chemistry for comparing the molecular refractive powers of
organic compounds, and has again been applied in the extensive and
important researches of BriihH-                 Far less are the attempts made to
test both expressions            for   the   di<U+FB01>erent    states of substances, and to
ascertain which of them agrees the best with the experimental
results. The papers of Lorenz and of PrytzI a<U+FB01>ord together seven

examined as <U+FB02>uids at 10° and 20° and compared to the vapours at

 natrium      <U+FB02>ame,   and not corrected for dispersion.          Lorenz observes
 that the deduction of the index of refraction for undulations of
 in<U+FB01>nite length is not possible with the same exactitude as is attained
 by direct observations with visible light, and prefers, therefore, to
 apply the experimental results in the formula.
     2. As Lorenz has determined by experiment for each substance
 in its <U+FB02>uid and gaseous condition the amount of dispersion, and this
 remains nearly the same in both cases, he concludes that this justi<U+FB01>es
 the use made of the expression for undulations of de<U+FB01>nite length,
 though it was deduced from those of in<U+FB01>nite length.
     3. The recorded calculations point out that, though a great change
 in speci<U+FB01>c gravity occurs when a substance is passing from one con
 dition into another, yet the relation between the refraction and the
 density approaches closely to a constant value, the greatest difference
 amounting to 5 per cent. with the acetate of ethyl.              It also appears
 that the expression established on theoretical grounds answers far
 better to the experiments than the empirical one, as is evident from
 the three latter columns in the tables.
    I   was induced by these considerations to try how far my own
 experiments would support these results, though less concordance is
 to be expected, as the exactitude is already impaired at the third
 decimal of the observed value.
     The next table contains my determinations put together with other
 quantities belonging to the same substance and required for calcula
 tion by both expressions. The indices of refraction of the gases are
 partly taken from the paper of Dulong* and others, occasionally from
 more recent and accurate researches made by Ketteler, Lorenz, and
 Croullebois. The densities of H3N, 002, S02, N20 in liquid condition
 have been accurately determined by Andréef, 1‘ that of liquid HCl by
 Ansdelll As in Dulong’s researches no special light is mentioned,
 it must be assumed that daylight was used in determining the
refraction ; I therefore employed my own corresponding values, taken
 with common light, for comparison, inasmuch as no recent experi
 ments on gases with natrium light have been published.
     From the results in the table, it is again evident that, though            no

   perfect concordance between the theoretical relation and the experi
   mental values is necessary, yet the ng-expression can be adapted in
   much higher degree to the observations than the empirically estab
   lished n-expressiou; and the di<U+FB01>erence between the calculated and
   observed quantity is in most cases no more than that existing also in
   the very accurate experiments of Lorenz, given in the table on p. 358.
   With the latter expression the value of the proportion is generally
   decreasing when the substance becomes gaseous ; with the former it is
   increasing; yet there are some exceptions.“I              Especially with nitrous
   oxide, there is a greater difference than with others, and I know of
                                     I
   no peculiar cause for it, as repeatedly examined the index.                    I must
   observe that also among the substances given in the paper of Lorenz,
  some of them may be remarked (for instance, the acetate of ethyl) as
  presenting a far greater difference than others.              The ethylene, also, is
   distinguished among the other substances by a far less concordance, but
   I may perhaps account for it by the very conditions of the experiment,
  as this had to be conducted very near to the critical temperature of
  the lique<U+FB01>ed substance.         I  must add, however, that if, with the value
  of the proportion given in the table for the liquid ethylene, the equi
- valent of refraction is calculated, the result is most satisfactory,
  corresponding to that deduced from refraction equivalents of the
  composing elements, added together<U+FB01>l' Accordingly we have—
              Refr. equiv. C2H4=O'321 X 28:8'99,                                .
              Refr. equiv. 2C+Refr. equiv. 4H=4'86+4'O8=8‘94.
       Of course such veri<U+FB01>cations may be made also for the other sub
  stances of the former table, and calculated for their liquid condition,
  but as these may be deduced as well from the gaseous state, and
  generally with more accuracy, I think there is no peculiar interest in
  adding the results.I
      "  In the experiments of Lorenz this value is for the examined compounds always
  increasing when they become gaseous; in those of Prytz it is for some increasing,
  for others decreasing.
      1' I employed in this calculation the expression M(n’—1)/(n2+ 2)d, in which M
  represents the molecular weight of the compound, and the refraction equivalents of
  C(=2'43), and of H(=1'02) were taken from the paper of Landolt (“ Sitzungsbcr.
  Preuss. Acad. v. Wissensch.,” 1882, I, p. 43).    If  the other expression, M(n—1)/d,
  and the corresponding values, O=4'86 and H= 1'29, are admitted, the concordance
  is much less, as we obtain 1394 (observed) and 14'88 (calculated).            Professor
  Gladstone remarks that as the carbon atoms in this compound, according to current
  theories of chemical constitution, are to be considered as double-linked, the
  calculated value is much higher (1053 or 1688) ; the difference from the experi
  mental value is too great to be accounted for by errors of observation.
      I  Landolt, in the paper alluded to above, made such veri<U+FB01>cations        with both
  expressions applied on nearly <U+FB01>fty organic compounds, and concluded that the n2
  formula gives more accurate results than the other when applied to the index of a

    The conclusion is that the concordance between the value deduced
from my experiments and that obtained from other observations is
tolerably satisfactory, 1' and the remark that the equivalent of
refraction of hydrogen in an inorganic combination, and especially in
an inorganic acid,I amounts to 3'5, is not applicable to lique<U+FB01>ed
hydrochloric acid, nor hydrobromic and hydriodic acid. They were
till now only examined in their solutions in water, and it has already
been pointed out by Land01t§ and others that the dissolving medium
does not exert the ‘same in<U+FB02>uence on the index of refraction as on
the density; my experiments being free from this in<U+FB02>uence may be
deemed appropriate to <U+FB01>x the value of the atomic refraction of
hydrogen in these compounds.
    *  I had to determine the density of liquid hydrobromic and hydriodic acid,
hitherto unknown.         I could not well apply the method of the compression apparatus,
as the mercury       is somewhat   attacked by the lique<U+FB01>ed gases.     I therefore employed
the Faraday tubes, with glass cell, described' beforev and provided at the end with a
calibrated capillary tube. The tube with its contents and the lique<U+FB01>ed gas was
weighed; then, by unscrewing the glass cell a little, a certain quantity of the liquid
 was allowed to escape.       The cell was closed and the whole tube weighed again. The
diminution in weight observed gave that of the escaped lique<U+FB01>ed gas, and its volume
was before noted in the capillary part of the tube.          I have found the speci<U+FB01>c weight
of liquid HBr=1'63 at 10°, that of liquid HI=2'27 at 12°.
    1' The difference between calculation and experiment in this case may perhaps be
accounted      for by the difference existing between the values communicated      by various
observers     for the same substance.       In the table the refr. equiv. of iodine given by
 Landolt as 24.87, is used; if I had admitted the value given by Professor Gladstone
as 245, the refr. equiv. of hydrogen would have amounted to 1‘3, according exactly
with other observations.
    1 Professor      Gladstone, loo. cit.    I  have shown previously that also from an
electro-chemical       point of view these liquids differ essentially from their aqueous
 solutions.                         .

 Determination of       the  Index of Refraction of Liquid Bromine              and some
                            Organo-Metallic Compounds.
    I add to this paper the results of experiments with some substances
that, though they are liquid at ordinary temperature, yet present some
dif<U+FB01>culties on being examined by the common methods; their index
of refraction has also till now not been observed directly.
    The practical ef<U+FB01>ciency of. the microscopical method is well illus
trated in the case of liquid bromine, which is very opaque even in thin
layers.     I had a glass cell constructed with parallel sides in a simple
way, by cementing together two plane glass disks, one of them
consisting of {a thin glass cover (as used in microscopical prepara
tions), with a hole in the centre ; this forming the proper vessel when
it was <U+FB01>nally covered with a glass disk, a single drop of liquid
bromine being previously put between.               Supplying a.140 magnifying
power, enough light (daylight) was transmitted through the layer to
permit the foeussing on scales of Lepidoptera wings.                          This layer
measured 0‘33 millim., the apparent displacement 0'12 millim. (as
a mean result of repeated observations);                   from this the index of
refraction is calculated as 1571 at a temperature of 13°.
    I examined also some orgauo-metallic compounds, especially those
 which are spontaneously ignited on 'contact with air.                       I employed
 doubly bent glass tubes, ending in the parallel-sided vessel and <U+FB01>lled
previonsly with carbonic acid gas. Then               I     distilled into them from
 another tube the liquid compound prepared in the usual way, a very
 small quantity being of course suf<U+FB01>cient.            I   add the following results,
 referring to the natrium light :—
                                                n.                     Temp.

    If  these values are compared to those of other metallic                compounds,
 as  for instance the tetrachloride of tin (SnCl4), its index amounting
 to 1'5225* (for the [3 line of the spectrum of hydrogen), we may
 remark that it is not necessary for a substance to be very combustible
 in order to have a very high index of refraction, an opinion that some
 times has been pronounced.

a   grand pianoforte accurately tuned in unison, were used to augment
the volume of tone.          The positions of all the nodes less than
39'4- inches from the belly-bridge        for the <U+FB01>rst 20 harmonics, were
previously    calculated.    All three  strings  were stopped at the same
distance from the belly-bridge with the edge of a piece of felt glued
to a piece of wood by Mr. Hartan, the foreman of the tuners, while
I struck the note. A considerable weight and steadiness of blow
was necessary to excite the harmonic.          The sound at <U+FB01>rst was dull

   and unmusical, but immediately afterwards the harmonic corre
   sponding to the node touched, sang out, always clearly enough to be
   unmistakably recognised, and sometimes, especially where the node
   corresponded to several harmonics, with along clear ring, that was
   made brighter and longer by removing the stopper from the string,
   which then vibrated in the small loops conditioned by the node
   touched.
      The following are the <U+FB01>rst 20 harmonics of this C determined
   theoretically.   Against each is placed its number of vibrations, and
   the name of the nearest note on the equally tempered scale, which
   was that of the piano used, with the theoretical number of hundredths
  of an equal semitone which had to be added to, or subtracted from,
  the pianoforte note, in order to give the true pitch of the harmonic.
  This list enabled the note heard to be immediately identi<U+FB01>ed, by
  touching the corresponding notes on the pianoforte.       Finally in the
  last column is given the number of inches from the belly-bridge at
  which one or more of the nodes of the harmonic would lie theo
  retically, for all the harmonics actually observed and brought out on
  the 29th July, 1884, in the presence of Dr. William Huggins, F.R.S.,
  who veri<U+FB01>ed the position of the node by a scale after the harmonic
  had been produced, and Mr. Alexander J. Ellis, F.R.S., who recorded
  the results. The examination of the numerous other positions of the
  nodes of these and other harmonics was omitted for brevity, as those
  possessing    most interest had been already produced, but those
  obtained on other occasions are inserted in a parenthesis.    Except in
  a few instances considered below, the practical place of the node did
  not di<U+FB01>er from the theoretical by more than '02 or '03 inch, within
  which limits it was didicult to be sure of the measurement.
     In calculating out the positions of all the nodes it was found that
  some lay very close together.    Thus a node of the 17th harmonic lay
'
  at 5'29 inches from the bridge, between one of the 9th harmonic at
  5 inches, and another of the 8th at 5'62, so that these nodes were
  only '3 inch apart. All these harmonics were brought out separately,
  but great care was necessary to hit the precise spot.     On the other
  hand the node of the 2nd harmonic at 22'5 inches lay between one of
  the 19th at 21'32 inches, or 12 inches nearer the bridge, and another
  also of the 19th at 23'68, or 1'2 farther from the bridge. Hence there
  was a space of 2'36 inches with only one harmonic node within it.
  Probably in consequence of this the 2nd harmonic could be brought
  out by touching the string at a considerable distance on either side
  of the theoretical place, because apparently the string had no other
  shape which it could assume.        It was determined that the limits
  within which the 2nd harmonic could be brought out were from 22'1
  to 22'95 inches from the bridge, allowing '85 inch play, but at 22'05
  and 23‘0 inches from the bridge the harmonic would not speak.

 Similarly for the 3rd harmonic which had its theoretical                        node  at
 15 inches from the bridge, between a node of the 19th at 1421 inches
 and one of the 20th at 1575 inches, leaving 1'64 inches unoccupied
 by nodes.       Practically the 3rd harmonic spoke from 14'75 to 154
 inches from the bridge, giving a “play” of '65 inch, but would
 not come out at 14'? or 1545.              These were the only two cases in
                                        ”
 which the amount of “play                was accurately determined. In each
 case the harmonic came out brightest and best at the theoretical
 node.    Dr. Huggins said that he had remarked a similar phenomenon
                                                  ” of
 on the violin, where he found a “ play                  about a quarter of an inch
 in stopping for the octave harmonic. Subsequently I brought out
     “            ”
 the 23rd harmonic f””# + 28, vib. 3124'6, at 1'96 inches from the
 bridge.    And going nearer, at 1'50 inches from, and until quite up
to, the belly-bridge,        I got out the dull prime note of the string C,
 without apparently any partial. The same note was produced also
 at 1'50 inches from the wrestplank-bridge.                     So that there is still
 more play for the prime note itself. The stopping seemed to obliterate
 all the upper partials, but allowed the string to vibrate as a simple
 tone in its full length. It is remarkable how many harmonics could
 be elicited by the means adopted from one length of string, and how
                                                                        2  B  2

clearly the high harmonics even to the 19th came out. Also it was
noticeable that the harmonic could be brought out by touching at any
one of its nodes, even at those very far distant from the striking
point, showing how accurately a comparatively stout string of great
tension could resolve itself into minute sub-vibrations.        Thus the 19th
harmonic was quite distinctly brought out, so as to be easily com
pared with e”” b, by touching the string at its second node from the
 bridge, leaving 40'26 inches of string to be agitated by the blow.
    The object of the experiment was to determine, if possible, the
effect of the striking place on the harmonics quenched. Helmholtz
(“Tonemp<U+FB01>ndnngen,”         fourth edition, p. 133) says that the striking
place is from     to

appears to be that the seventh and ninth partial tones disappear, or,

striking measures, and the same was true of the early pianofortes,
as those of Ste-in, Mozart’s favourite pianoforte maker.            The great
length of the bass strings as carried out on the single belly-bridge,
copied from the harpsichord, made          impossible to equalise the striking

who <U+FB01>rst endeavoured to equalise the scale in tension and striking
place.   Assisted by Signor Cavallo and the then Dr. Gray of the
British Museum, he produced the divided belly-bridge which enabled
him to reduce the length of the bass strings, and hence gained                         a
uniform striking place.      He adopted the vibrating length, allowing

that the latter requires a softer hammer to bring out a pleasant tone,
and that g   is much better. The present head of the house of Broad
wood (Mr. Henry Fowler Broadwood) has arrived at the same con
 clusions, and adopted      the vibrating length as the striking place for

to  “          ”
      equalise instruments where the striking place was between 11.,
and 3T the vibrating length, and it is the latter place which Helmholtz
has adopted for his table of experiments (ibid., p. 13-5), in which the
6th harmonic is made very weak, and the 7th disappears altogether.
                   I
   Now the table have given shows that though the striking place
was adjusted with great accuracy to § the vibrating length, not only
the 7th and 9th harmonics, but also the 8th and even the 16th, were
brought out distinctly.       The 7th was particularly strong and clear,
and the 9th was very good indeed. The 8th harmonic was not so
strong, but it was perfectly clear, and it was got out at three of its
nodes.     Of course, it has 7 nodes, but of the 4 where it was not
brought out, 2 were nodes of the 4th harmonic, and 1 a node of the
2nd harmonic, and the 8th was, of course, absorbed in these, while
the remaining node was the striking place itself.           Perhaps the reason
why   the  8th harmonic   did  not  disappear   was  that  the striking surface
of the hammer was not a perfectly hard edge, but a yielding surface, so
that the blow spread on both sides of the intentional striking place,
and thus excited the string at very slight distances from the node
itself.   But whatever may have been the cause the result was quite
distinct, and recognised clearly by Dr. Huggins and Mr. Ellis, as well
as myself and Mr. Hartan.         So that there is no doubt whatever that
striking   with  a pianoforte   hammer     at a node does not obliterate the
corresponding harmonic.
   For the 16th harmonic there are 15 nodes, 1 at the striking place,
1 between the striking place and the wrestplank-bridge,               neither of
which could be tried, 3 which were also nodes of the 8th harmonic,
2‘ of the 4th, and 1 of the 2nd.        .The remaining 7 belong to the 16th
harmonic alone, and of these it was thought suf<U+FB01>cient to try two,
which produced the sound quite clearly. The neighbouring 15th and
17th harmonics also came out well.            These are an additional proof
that a pianoforte hammer striking at a node does not destroy the
harmonic due to that node.          Subsequently   I   had an opportunity of
trying   the  middle  0’ string  of  one   of Steinway’s grand pianofortes.
This string was 2875 inches long, and was struck at 3‘2 inches from
the wrestplank-bridge, that      is, at%    of its length.I    got out the 6th.
 7th, 8th, and 9th harmonics just as in Broadwood’s piano, the 6th
and 7th both beautifully strong; the 8th and 9th weaker, but clear
and unmistakable—a further con<U+FB01>rmation of the fact that the piano
forte hammer does not obliterate the harmonic at whose node                  it
strikes.

  Il.  “ Tonometrical     Observations on some existing Non-harmonic
         Musical Scales.” By ALEXANDER J. ELLIS, B.A., F.R.S.,
         assisted by ALFRED J. HIPKINS (of John Broadwood and
         Sons).   Received October 30, 1884.
     Musical Scales are said to be Harmonic or Non-harmonic according
 as they are or are not adapted for playing in harmony.
     Most accounts of non-harmonic scales, such as the Greek, Arabic,
 and Persian, either (1) are derived from native theoreticians, who
 give the comparative lengths of the strings for the several notes,
 whence, 0n the assumption that the numbers of vibrations are inversely
proportional to the lengths (which is only approximately correct in
practice), the intervals from note to note are inferred ; or (2) are
attempts to express the e<U+FB01>ects of the intervals by the European equally
tempered scale.       The former when reduced, as in Professor J. P. N.
Land’s “ Gamme Arabe,” 1884, is the best that can be done without
hearing the scales themselves.         The latter is utterly delusive and mis
leading.
    Having about 100 tuning-forks, the pitch of each of which has been
                                              “ Proc.
determined by Scheibler’s forks (see                   Roy. Soc,” June, 1880,
vol. 30, p. 525),   and  having   had   an   opportunity of hearing the notes
themselves produced on various instruments, and having had the great
advantage of being assisted by Mr. A. J. Hipkins's musical ear, which
is wonderfully      acute to detect and estimate minute di<U+FB01>erences of
pitch, and without which I could have done little,*            I have been able,
I   believe for the <U+FB01>rst time, to take down the actual pitch of the notes
in various existing non-harmonic scales far better than it was possible
to do with the siren or the monochord, which are not only di<U+FB01>icult to
manipulate and to carry about, but at the best are very apt to mis
lead.     Where it was impossible actually to hear the sounds,          I carefully
 measured the comparative vibrating lengths of the strings producing
 the notes on fretted instruments, whence, with by no means the same
 certainty, the scales could be inferred.         But   I have not here noted
these measurements or their results, unless         I could contrast them with
 the intervals obtained by ‘measuring the actual pitch of the notes pro
 duced on the instruments themselves, as in the cases of India and
 Japan.
     But the mere statement of the numbers of vibrations, or of the
vibrating lengths of the strings producing a scale, conveys no musical
 notion whatever to a musician.         He wants to know how many equally

  take the logarithm of the interval ratio and seek the next least in
 the <U+FB01>rst column of the table; then the next least to the di<U+FB01>erence, and
 so on, taking the cents opposite.              Generally it suf<U+FB01>ces to take to the
 nearest cent, as that expresses an insensible interval.                   Thus, if the
 numbers of vibrations are 44-0 and 528, the difference of their logs.
 is '07918; the next least in the <U+FB01>rst column, “07526, gives 300 cts.,
 with remainder, ‘00392 ; the next least to which in the second column,
 '00251, gives 10 cts., and remainder, '00141; the next least to which
 in the third column, '00125, gives 5 cts., and remainder, '00016, which
 in the fourth column gives '6 ct. Hence the interval is 3156 cts.,
 for which usually 316 cts. is suf<U+FB01>cient to write. Now this shows that
the interval contains 3 equal Semitones, and 16 hundredths of a Semi
    * The <U+FB01>rst  person to propose the measuring of musical intervals by equal Semi
tones was,   I believe,   de Prony, but   I have not been able to see his pamphlet; the
next was the late Professor de Morgan (“ Cam. Phil. Trans,” x, 129), from whom I
learned it, and I employed it in the Appendix of my translation of Helmholtz, by
the advice of Mr. Bosanquet.        Having found that two places of decimals suf<U+FB01>ced for
most purposes,     I  was led to take the second place, or hundredth of an equal Semi
tone as the unit, and [ have extensively employed this practice, here for the <U+FB01>rst
time published, with the greatest advantage.          In fact, I do not know how I could
have expressed the results of the present investigation in any other brief and precise,
and at the same time suggestive, method.

   It must be borne in mind that give the actual intervals heard        I
from or measured on actual instruments, and that these, we may
safely say, never represent the intervals intended by the tuner, within
from  5 to 20 cents either way, on account of the extreme dif<U+FB01>culty of
precise tuning, especially when the intervals are non-harmonic.
European ears are at present satis<U+FB01>ed, on our theoretical equally
tempered scale, with Fifths too <U+FB02>at, and Fourths too sharp by       cts.,                                                               2

14 cents, and major Sixths too sharp by 16 cents, while of course the
minor Sixths are 14 cts. too <U+FB02>at, and the minor Thirds 16 cts. too <U+FB02>at.
That is to say, these would be the errors if the tuning were perfect.
The practice, as I have determined by actual measurement, is neces
sarily far from being restricted to these limits. Hence the results
here given have to be compared with many other results from other
instruments of the same kind, tuned by different tuners before the
intended intervals could be, if they ever can be, satisfactorily deter
mined.      In the meantime we know that native ears have actually
                                                                             '
been satis<U+FB01>ed by the intervals here given.
    It must also be remembered that as the tones heard were often
exceedingly brief (as from wood harmonicons), or very impure, being
mixed with inharmonic proper tones (as from metal harmonicons,
kettles, gongs, &c.‘), it was generally impossible to count beats, and
often even exceedingly di<U+FB02>icult to tell within what pair of forks
the note heard really lay, so that there is a possible error of two
vibrations occasionally, but, thanks to the acuteness of Mr. Hipkins’s
ear, it is not probable that the error at any time exceeds one vibration
in a second.        The number determined is therefore purposely given
only to the nearest integer.

(where the <U+FB01>gures between give the number of cents from note to
note, and the <U+FB01>gures below give the number of cents from the lowest
note), introduced       a division,   which,     carried   out   to the  Octave,
amounted to—

where qE’ and qA mean about a quarter of a tone less than (or before
coming to) E and A, and in the same way Eq, Aq would mean a
quarter of a tone beyond E and A.            (In musical notes q will become
q, a  turned   1,.)
   In later periods this was tempered to a division of the Octave into
24 equal Quartertones, as we learn from Eli Smith, an American
missionary at Damascus, who translated Meshaqah’s treatise in
the “ Journal of the American Oriental Society,” 1849, vol. i, pp. 171—

although in the Middle Ages a different scale prevailed in Arabia, to
which I need not further allude. Now between Zalzal’s time and this
mediaeval alteration the Crusaders brought the Syrian bagpipe to
England, and after it had passed out of fashion in England, it became
the national instrument of the Highlands of Scotland.
     Such an instrument, made by Macdonald, of Edinburgh, and
obligingly played to us by its possessor, Mr. Charles Keene, the well
known artist, yielded on examination the following results :—

     The tempered form, therefore, coincides with the Damascus form of
Zalzal’s scale, which               I   did not discover till long afterwards.                 The
theory of this scale is lost, but it is usual to make 9’ to a' rather
less than a whole tone, while the two drones, an Octave and two
Octaves below a', necessitate a pure Fifth, a' 702 e”. Zalzal divided a
Pythagorean minor Third of 294 cents into 151 and 143 cents; the
modern instrument divides the just minor Third 316 cents, probably,
into 151 and 165 parts. We thus get a possible rationalised form of
the bagpipe scale, the <U+FB01>rst attempted, so far as                       I know.      As usual in
bagpipe music, I begin the scale on a'.                      I have calculated the vibra

    Observe IV 356 cents. and VII 856 cents, which compare with
 Zalzal in I. ARABIA.               All the Octaves were too sharp. The old Indian
 stringed instrument is the Vina with frets % to % inch high, so that
 by pressing the string behind the fret the pitch can be greatly
altered. These frets are shiftable, but are usually fastened with wax.
 I measured the vibrating lengths of string of many, but consider                          I
the resulting scales not sufficiently trustworthy for record here.                                  This
pressing        behind        the  fret  is  constantly employed           to   sharpen      the   pitch
by a quarter or half a Tone. The modern Sita’r, which has practically
superseded the Vina, is a very long-necked guitar with movable frets.
These frets are set for the rag or rzigim' (tune, key, or mode) in which
the musician is going                    play. They are high enough above the <U+FB01>nger
board to allow pressure behind to exert a sensible e<U+FB01>ect, but the
ordinary method of raising the pitch is to deflect the string by
moving the <U+FB01>nger with the string transversely along the fret. As,
however, the frets are properly set, this de<U+FB02>ection is used only for
grace notes at the end, suddenly raising the pitch about a quarter of
2. Tone and returning it to its former position.
    H.H. Raja Ram Pal Singh was kind enough to bring his sitar
(which he left with me), and setting it in <U+FB01>ve different manners to
play Indian airs to us. After he had done so 1 measured the position
of the frets, so that I could return them to their places.                                Afterwards
we sounded each note, took its pitch, and determined the scale by my
forks.                   I
             This, believe, is the <U+FB01>rst time that this has been done for
any Indian instrument.                     The pitch for the open string was not the
same as that used by the Raja, for these measurements were not
taken till long afterwards, but the relative pitch remained the same.
This string, which was an English pianoforte steel Wire, replacing
the Indian steel wire which was broken, was too thick, and this
interfered somewhat with the setting.                               As I had calculated the

  the string lying naturally                      further       above the frets for the last notes,

  the fret. Also observe how nearly                              III   approaches to 350 cents in the

    The scales were observed from the instruments of the Javesc
Gamelang or band, at the Aquarium, in November, 1882, and formed
the commencement of these investigations.                                           We were materially
assisted by work done on the same instruments (but without deter
mining pitch) by Mr. W. Stephen Mitchell, M.A., of Gonville and
 Caius College, Cambridge, and by determinations with the monochord
 of similar instruments in Holland by Professor J. P. N. Land
                                                                                                               (who

  also  gave me much information), assisted by Dr. Onnes, both of
  Leyden.        Professor Land also kindly communicated the results of
  the measurements by Dr. Loman and Dr. Figée, both of Leyden.
  These measurements of distinct instruments are annexed in a re
  duced form.
      There are two entirely different Javese orchestras which cannot
, play together. we examined three sets of instruments from each—the
  Gambang, or wooden harmonicon, the Sdron and Sléntem, or metal
  bar harmonicons, and the Bonang, or set of kettles—while in Leyden
  a Géndér (another metal harmonicon) and a diiferent Sa'n'on were
  examined.
      The <U+FB01>rst orchestra played Saléndrc, the second Pélog scales, both
  Pentatonic; but, as will be seen, completely different. The <U+FB01>rst had
  only <U+FB01>ve notes in the Octave, the second had seven, but used only <U+FB01>ve
  atatime, just as Europeans have twelve, but use only seven at a time.
  The <U+FB01>rst has no interval between consecutive notes so small as a
  major Second, or so large as a minor Third. The second has between
  two consecutive notes of its seven, approximatively two Semitones,
  (no Tone), three Three-quartertones, and two minor Thirds. The
  <U+FB01>rst is very uniform, the second very diverse in its intervals},

hammers. The instrument being out of tune was tuned for us by the
musician who played No. 7, according to the Chinese names of the

    This was again             so nearly just that       I  have conjectured a just resto
ration, 0' D1 E, G A1 a : and if this is transformed, by beginning it with
 G, or by deducting 702 cents from each of the last sums (previously
adding 1200 cents where needed), we obtain the scale G 182 A1
 316 G 182 D1 2041 E1 316 G, in which the intervals are precisely the
same as in No. 7.
    9. Balloon Guitar or P’i-p’a.——The body of the guitar was oval.
 There were four strings, the lowest tuned to 234 vib., and then its
Fourth, its Fifth, and its Octave, but we did not test the accuracy of
these intervals, which were tuned by the same musician who tuned
Nos. 7 and 8. Near the nut were four large, round-backed, semi
 elliptical frets, joining each other at bottom.                              These the player
 did not use. But on two examples of the S. K. Museum,                                       I   con
jectured by measuring the strings, that they were intended to give
 such a tetrachord as—
                       C'      204     D      90    El,     114    E       90     F

 or their just or tempered forms.                     There were 12 frets on the body of
 the instrument.               They were high but broad at the top. We did not
 test each, but merely took down the following pentatonic scale :—

     The tempered scale agrees well in all notes but V. The scale is so
 remarkable in every way, though it did not sound amiss, that I
 suspect the frets to have been inaccurately placed ; they were bits of
 wood roughly glued on.
     This completes our observations with the Chinese musicians.                                     I
 measured also the vibrating lengths of strings in two other P’i-p’as,
 and also two Moon Guitars or Yueh-chins in the S. K. Museum.
 One Of the latter seemed intended for equal temperament                                            of
  12 Semitones, and it is the only Chinese instrument                                 which has
 suggested this to me ; the other looked like an attempt to divide the
  Octave into eight Three-quartertones, and had at any rate eight tones

    The  I  313  II  is nearly a perfect minor Third of 316 cents. The           III
 and  IV    give  almost       precisely the J avese Saléndro observed     III 484,
 and IV 728, so that the interval between them, 244 cents, is almost
precisely a Pentatone of 240 cents, or % Octave. If indeed                  II were
 <U+FB02>atter, the notes of the bells might pass as part of such a scale.
                                         IX. JAPAN.
    In the Educational Section of the International Health Exhibition
of 1884 there was a considerable collection of Japanese instruments,
but there were no players. The only instruments which we could try
therefore were a Sh6 (the Chinese shéng (see CHINA, 3), but different
in the number and pitch and intervals of the notes) and a Biwa, or
four-string fretted lute. The She we found to be out of tune, as referred
to the scale exhibited, and to be impossible to blow satisfactorily.
The Biwa I <U+FB01>rst tried by measuring the lengths of the strings, and
afterwards with Mr. Hipkins, by tuning the strings arbitrarily and
taking the pitch from each fret. These results                I record, because in
addition to the examples               from  India,  they show very well that
measurements of lengths are only an approximation to the speaking
values of the strings, and that the latter vary considerably with the
thickness of the strings.              This has an important bearing upon the
theoretical determination of scales given by the divisions of the
string. The results for India were valuable in this respect, but
they were not altogether satisfactory, because the string was English
and too thick. In the present case we had the genuine Japanese
strings.
    The Biwa is        a large and heavy but handsome instrument, well
made    and   <U+FB01>nished,    and answers exactly to Al Farabi’s lute in Professor
Land’s     “ Gamme Arabe,” the four strings nearly coinciding at the
nut, passing over a semi-circular depression to the large tuning
pegs, and spreading out to a convenient distance apart by the bridge,
so that the plectrum, made of hard wood, spread out like the head of
a halbert, could easily be inserted between the strings, or pass over
them in rapid succession for arpeggio chords for which the instrument

 seems to be much used   in accompaniments, judging from some music
 written for it in Japan, on the European staff, the original of which
 I saw. The diameters of the strings, which seemed to be of hard
 corded silk, taken by one of Elliott’s micrometer gauges, were 1'65,
 1‘37, 1'06, and 0'88 mm. in diameter respectively.  The variations of
 interval, however, with the thickness of the string appear not to
follow any precise law. The frets were high and about 5 mm. wide
of the top, made of hard wood.                              I
                                     was very careful to press on the
top of the fret, so that the tension of the string might not be                                           -
increased, and the action should take place from the edge of the fret
nearest the bridge.    But possibly I may not always have pressed
near enough to the edge, so that the string was slightly lengthened
and the pitch <U+FB02>attened. Of course nothing like such accuracy would
be reached by the player.

   The     effect   of temporary longitudinal traction on the electrical
resistance      of cobalt was determined by a method similar to that
already described in a former portion of this memoir-{'- and it was found
that, like nickel, this metal has its resistance decreased by moderate
temporary stress, in spite of the changes of dimensions which ensue.
Whether the decrease of resistance would be changed to increase, as
it is with nickel, by a greater amount of stress, has not yet been
ascertained, but should this be the case, the magnitude of the stress
per unit area which would su<U+FB02>ice for the purpose must be much
greater with cobalt than with nickel.                 As with nickel, permanent
extension and rolling diminish the effect of temporary longitudinal
traction, so that there is a larger decrease of resistance caused by a
given stress with annealed than with unannealed cobalt.
    Cobalt is remarkable for the extreme persistence with which the
same load, when applied again and again, continues to produce per
manent increase of resistance, and probably increase of length, but for
a moderate amount of permanent extension the increase of resistance
is more than accounted for by the permanent increase of length and
 diminution of section which take place; so that, as with iron and
 nickel, the speci<U+FB01>c resistance is decreased by moderate permanent
 extension.       The permanent decrease of speci<U+FB01>c resistance per unit
 for unit permanent increase of length is, for iron, cobalt, and nickel,
 0‘02, 1'44, and 2'37 respectively;            thus the permanent decrease of
 speci<U+FB01>c   resistance,   as well as  the   temporary decrease of resistance, is
 greater   with   nickel  than  with   cobalt.

traction on the thermo-electric          qualities of cobalt was examined, and
it was found that temporary longitudinal                traction renders cobalt tem
porarily positive      as regards    its thermo-electric       qualities, to cobalt not
under traction, provided there is no magnetic stress acting at the same
time on the metal. The results obtained would, therefore, not only be
adverse to the above-mentionedhypothesis                  of the author, but also to
Bidwell’s theory that the “ Hall effect
                                                   ”
                                                      is due to the joint action of
 mechanical strain and certain “Peltier eifeots,” were it not that in
 Hall’s experiments the metal is under very considerable magnetic
 stress, which latter has been proved to alter very appreciably the
thermo-electric properties of iron, nickel, and cobalt,* and under these
circumstances both the e<U+FB01>ect of mechanical stress on the speci<U+FB01>c
resistance-I" and that on the thermo-electric qualities of cobalt may be
different to what they are, when there is no magnetic stress acting on
the metal.
    Longitudinal magnetic stress was found to render cobalt negative
thermo-electrical to cobalt not under stress.
    The cobalt used was in the form of a strip, and the section, which
was fairly uniform throughout the whole length, was 0'06168 square
cm.; the length was 584 cm., and the mass 29'65 grams.
                                               ”
    The value of “ Young’s modulus                was determined by the method
of longitudinal vibrations, the strip being held in the centre, and
rubbed along its length with a resined glove.
    The effect of longitudinal traction on the electrical resistance of
unannealed piano-steel was tried, the stress used being eventually
increased nearly to the breaking-point, with the view of ascertaining
whether the increase of speci<U+FB01>c resistance which had been previously
found to follow on moderate longitudinal                     traction might not be
changed       to  decrease.    This   was  not   the   case;   but, on the contrary,
whatever the permanent           load  might be,     a   temporary addition to this
produced exactly the same temporary effect.                  The fresh experiments,
however, con<U+FB01>rmed the results obtained with the older ones, and
agreed with these in making the alteration of resistance due to trac
tion, both for unit stress per square unit of area and per unit increase
of length, less for steel than for iron.
     The electrical resistance of magnesium proved to be temporarily
increased by temporary longitudinal traction of moderate amount, but
the amount of increase was less than could be accounted for by mere
change of dimensions, so that the speci<U+FB01>c resistance of magnesium,
like that of aluminium, is decreased by the temporary stress. It was
found also that when the permanent load on the wire is very small, both
the temporary increase of length and the temporary increase of resist

    The results obtained from the experiments on the effects of stress
on the electrical speci<U+FB01>c resistance of magnesium are in perfect accord
ance with the view that there is a relation between the “ Hall e<U+FB01>ect
                                                                        ”
and the alteration of speci<U+FB01>c resistance.
    The electrical resistance of the alloy platinum-iridium‘l" is much more
increased by temporary longitudinal traction than that of either of
the components of the alloy. On the contrary the electrical resistances
 of platinum-silver, German-silver, and brass are all considerably less
 increased than is the case with their components.        This circumstance
 would   rather militate against  the employment of platinum-iridium in
 making standard resistance coils. The increase of resistance alluded
 to above is much greater than can be accounted for by change of
dimensions, so that the increase of speci<U+FB01>c resistance produced by
 longitudinal traction is considerably greater than is the case with any
 of those other metals examined whose resistance is increased by trac
tion.
    The alteration of resistance above mentioned at <U+FB01>rst increases in
 greater proportion than the load, but, when a certain limit of stress
 has been reached, the ratio of the temporary increase of resistance to
 the load producing it begins to diminish, and <U+FB01>nally reaches the same

the other metals, but in none is the phenomenon so pronounced as in
platinum-iridium.
    The value of “Young’s modulus” was determined for platinum
 iridium, both by the method of static extension, and by that of longi
 tudinal vibrations, and the results obtained were in fair agreement.
                         ”
 “Young’s modulus           is with the alloy considerably greater than with
 the two components, so much so as quite to equal if not to excel the
 value of the same modulus for piano-steel.            The “simple rigidity”
 got by the method of torsional vibrations is also considerably greater
 with the alloy than with its components.
    Unstretched platinum-silver         was found to be thermo-electrically
positive   to the  temporarily    stretched  metal, and forms a very striking
 exception to the rule which holds good for most metals, namely, that
 those metals which are increased to a comparatively large extent by
 traction in speci<U+FB01>c resistance are those which are rendered most
 thermo-electrically negative by traction.
    A further examination was made of the' “ critical points ” of metals,
i.e., points at which there is a sudden increase of the ratio of the per
manent extension or permanent change of resistance produced by
 loading, and the load when the latter is increased by small and equal
amounts at a time. This examination ended in the discovery of a
         “ critical
fourth               point,” occurring with a load exactly half of that at
 the previously so-called <U+FB01>rst “ critical point,” further, it was ascer
tained that the four “critical points” are in the remarkably simple
ratios 1 : 2 : 3 : 4. Table     I gives the loads at the four

    The above table shows not only that the four “ critical points              are
in the above-mentioned simple ratios, but also that with all metals the

IV.      On the Variations of the Mean Diurnal Inequality of the
      Horizontal Component of the Earth’s Magnetic Force at
      Bombay, and their Relations to the Sun-spot Period.” By
      FREDERICK CHAMBERS, Acting Superintendent of the Colaba
      Observatory, Bombay.         Communicated by C. CHAMBERS,
      F.R.S., Superintendent of the Colaba Observatory.               Re
      ceived October 9, 1884.
                                (Abstract)
   The investigation with which this paper deals was suggested by a
remark made by Dr. Balfour Stewart, in “Nature,” vol. xxiii, p. 238,
to the effect that well selected magnetic observations might ulti
mately be found to indicate variations of solar heat more quickly and
with greater certainty than any other kinds of indirect observations.
The observations selected are those of the variations of the horizontal
magnetic force, recorded at the Colaba Observatory, Bombay, between
the years 1846 and 1880, comprising about 255,000 hourly observa
tions. The mean diurnal variations for each month, calculated from
all the observations, without any exclusion of disturbances, were
extracted from the records of the Observatory; but instead of adopt
ing, in the usual manner, the extreme range of these variations as the
subject for further treatment, the mean of all the twenty_four hourly
deviations, regardless of signs, was adopted; the objects aimed at
in departing from the usual rule being to give due weight to all the
observations, and to eliminate, as far as possible, the e<U+FB02>'ects of rapidly
<U+FB02>uctuating disturbances, without rejecting any of the observations.
The monthly number obtained in the manner above described may
be called the mean diurnal inequality for the month.        The series of
such monthly numbers should, after elimination of the annual varia
tion, exhibit allthose variations of the magnitude of the diurnal varia
tion of the earth’s magnetic force which may possibly depend on
absolute variations of solar heat.     Indications may therefore be thus
obtained of all real variations of solar energy whose periods lie between
one month and thirty-three years, if such there be.     Several magnetic
variations are shown to exist, and these are compared with the varia
tions of the sun-spots.
   The following is a brief summary of the principal results of the
investigation :—
   1. The mean diurnal inequality of horizontal force at Bombay is
subject to a periodical variation, whose duration is almost exactly
                                                        ‘
eleven years.
   2.  It  is also subject to an annual variation,   whose  amplitude    is

1884.]         and its Relations   to the Sun-spot  Period.           393
greater in the maximum years of the eleveniyearly period than in the
minimum years of that period, the amplitude varying nearly in pro
portion to the mean diurnal inequality for the year.
   3. It is also subject to a variation whose duration is more than
thirty-three years.
   4. If any other periodical variations than those above mentioned
have any existence, their amplitudes must be small, or the duration of
their periods must be less than one year, or more than thirty-three
years.
   5. The maximum and minimum values of the eleven-yearly period,
and the range between them, have all increased in the successive
eleven-yearly periods of the years 1846 to 1879.
   6. The range of the eleven-yearly period is roughly proportional to
the mean diurnal inequality for the interval from which the range is
calculated.
   7. The principal    features of the eleven-yearly period coincide
(except in point of time) with those of the well-known sun-spot period.
The duration of the period is the same in both cases, and both varia
tions exhibit a relatively rapid rise from minimum to maximum in
about four and a half years, and a relatively slow fall from maximum
to minimum in about six and a half years.
   8. The magnetic curve precedes the sun-spot area curve by as much
as six months.
   9. The magnetic curve is more regular than the sun-spot area
curve.
   These or similar conclusions, with the possible exceptions of the
last two, have either been enunciated by previous investigators, or
 are directly deducible from their labours; but the evidence          now
 advanced is probably more decisive than any that has hitherto been
published.
    On the whole, the conclusions arrived at seem to support Dr. Stewart’s
 views in a very unexpected manner, for not only does the eleven
 yearly magnetic variation precede the eleven-yearly variations of
 certain meteorological elements, but it actually precedes, by several
 months, the eleven-yearly variation of the sun-spots themselves; and
 the probable error of a single monthly determination of a point on
 the magnetic curve is little more than 5 per cent. of the greatest range
 of the eleven-yearly oscillation, a degree of accuracy which is pro
 bably unapproached by any other kind of observations.

      Received October 29, 1884.
   The number of specimens described in this concluding paper           of the
series is not great, although more mountains are represented than on
any other occasion.        Four out of the <U+FB01>ve mountains enumerated
above are volcanic, and, as      will  be seen, their rocks all belong  to the
audesite group.     Sara-urcu, however, consists wholly of metamorphic

1884.]      illir-roscopic  Structure of   some Roe/cs from Ecuador.     395
rocks, and thus lies outside the volcanic zone.         I  am again indebted
to Mr. Whymper for the interesting general              notes which are pre
faced to the lithological descriptions.
                                      Altar.
    “ This mountain is
                             probably the <U+FB01>fth in rank of the Ecuadorian
Andes, and according to Messrs. Boise and Stiibel is 17,730 feet high.
Owing to long continued bad weather I could neither ascend nor
measure it. It is about 40 miles E.S.E. of Chimborazo, and lies S.
of Cotopaxi, having nearly the same longitude.
     “ In the older
                      maps of Ecuador this mountain is sometimes called
Los Collanes, and there is a valley leading from it in a westerly
direction still bearing that name.           I encamped at the head of this
valley close     under  the main   mass   of  the mountain (12,540 feet) and
in the neighbouring valley of Naranjal (13,050 feet) for <U+FB01>ve days, and
experienced during the whole time a succession of storms of wind,
 rain, hail, and snow, and such observations as could be made were
 obtained with much di<U+FB01>iculty.
     “ The
            peaks of Altar have been considered by previous travellers to
 fringe the edge of a broken-down crater. Appearances are in favour
 of this supposition, though there does not seem to be any distinct
 evidence in support of it. The valley of Collanes leads away from
 the open, or broken-down side, and if it were followed up to its;
 furthest extremity the traveller would <U+FB01>nd himself in a vast cirque
 <U+FB01>lled with glacier, and bordered by peaks rising to heights 4,000 feet
 above his level.      The valley of Collanes is not at present occupied by
 such masses of débris as we should expect to <U+FB01>nd if there had been,
 any great convulsion which wrecked the western side of the crater.
     “ The highest
                      peak of Altar is situated at the head of the valley of
 Collanes, on its left bank or southern side.         On the opposite side of‘
 the crater (i.e., on the right bank or northern side of the valley) there
 are several points only slightly inferior in elevation to the highest
 peak; but at the extreme head of the valley (i.e., the eastern side oii
 the crater) the edge of the rim of the crater is considerably lower than
  upon its north and south sides.        The summit of this depressed part
  might, in my opinion, be reached from the interior of the crater, but
  the highest point could not.          Its face towards the interior of the
  crater is as steep as the most abrupt part of the Eigher in the
  Bernese Oberland, and it is covered with small hanging glaciers.
  From the exterior of the crater the summit of this peak may perhaps
  be reached, My assistant, J. A. Carrel, reported favourably upon it,
  stating that there was a large glacier upon its southern side (which
  was unseen from the valley of Collanes), and he brought back from
   the highest point he reached (which was probably about 3,000 feet

taneously to report upon the northern side of the second summit,
 brought back from the highest point he reached (about 14,500 feet)
the specimen D.”
   A. This is a very dark compact rock, with fairly numerous specks of
a greyish felspar, and with occasional minute vesicles.             Under the
microscope the ground-mass is found to be a glass, in itself almost
colourless, but so crowded with opacite as to appear almost opaque with
low powers; in fact its true structure can only be seen in very thin sec
tions and with high powers. In this also minute crystallites probably
of a plagioclastic felspar abound. Crystals of the same mineral of
larger size are also very frequent; the larger are often about '02 inch
diameter, or even more, but the smaller and more frequent are not
much more than one-tenth of that size. The larger crystals resemble
in all respects those so often described, and are probably labradorite;
the smaller are lath-shaped, and appear to have smaller extinction
angles, and so may belong to one of the species containing more silica.
Besides these there are a fair number of crystals of augite, some very
well characterised, some containing enclosures of brownish glass.
There are also one or two crystalline grains, partly replaced by a
secondary dark-brown            mineral, which appear to me to be not
improbahly olivine.          There are also some small round specks of a
gummy-brown isotropic mineral.            It is possible that these are amyg
daloidal and a variety of palagonite. From the above description it is
evidently a little dif<U+FB01>cult to decide whether to retain this rock in the
augite-andesites or to term it a basalt, and a chemical analysis would
be necessary to settle this point. It is evidently near the border line,
but   I  prefer on the whole to class it with the augite-andesites.
   B. This specimen is a rough scoriaceous lava, weathering a. dull'
reddish to brownish colour ; it is full of small cavities, but in the more
compact portions little crystals of light-coloured felspar are common.
It is evidently so closely related to A that, as the specimen is in a less
favourable condition for examination, I have not had it sliced.              Of
the two I should more unhesitatingly name this one an augite
andesite.
   C.    A  very dark compact rock containing fairly numerous specks
of  a   light-coloured felspar.      The specimen is a fragment of pris
matic form, having six sides pretty clearly, though unequally, de
<U+FB01>ned.       Examined microscopically the ground-mass is seen to be
composed        of a mass of felted microliths of plagioclastic        felspnr
 (probably     to  a large extent oligoclase), with granules of augite and
of iron peroxide, most of which are in all probability magnetite.
The structure in short is one common in andesites and allied
varieties of “trachyte.”           Probably a little glass remains unin
dividualised, but       I have not been able to satisfy myself on this point.

   Scattered in this, and belonging probably to an earlier stage of con
  solidation, are the following minerals: (a) plagioclastic felspar, often
  about '02 to '04 inch diameter, probably, as usual, labradorite.            Many
  of these have a broken and corroded aspect, this being more than
  usually conspicuous;          (b) magnetite;       (c) grains of a pyroxenic
  mineral. It is rather dif<U+FB01>cult to decide upon the species of the last ;
  some of the grains are prismatic in form, but others have a more or
  less rounded outline.        The cleavage seems imperfect.         The mineral is
  clear, colourless, and of a rather frosted texture.             The imperfection
  0f the external form and of the cleavage makes it dif<U+FB01>cult to obtain
  clear indications of the crystalline system.          Brilliant colours are given
  with crossing Nicols.        It is not impossible the mineral may be mono
  clinic, still some results suggest the probability that it is ortho
  rhombic. If an augite, it is rather abnormal, but we must be prepared
  for the presence of some other magnesian silicate, such as olivine or
  (more probably) enstatite.          Be this as it may, the rock itself is a
  member of the augite-andesite group.
   ‘ The rock I), from the north side of Altar, has a different aspect,
  being   (like some already described) a reddish-grey trachyte, studded
  with crystals of rather glassy white felspar, roughly about '1 inch
 diameter, and containing some minute vesicles.                It has not yielded a
 very good slide.        The ground-mass appears to be a clear glass, with
 numerous lath-like crystallites of felspar, but is so thickly crowded
 with ferrite and opacite, especially the former, as to be all but opaque
 except in the thinnest part of the section.              In this ground-mass are
 scattered crystals of the usual plagioclastic felspar, and a pyroxenic
 mineral ; some of this is monoclinic augite, but             I  think a few grains
 are certainly orthorhombic.            Thus the rock is an augite-andesite,
 probably containing some hypersthene.

and at the time   of my partial ascents the crests of the ridges leading
to  the  highest point were coated fantastically with overhanging
cornices of snow and small glaciers.    On the south side, such rocks as
could be seen in situ were a highly decomposed trachyte, which
externally bore an almost chalky-white appearance, with veins and
patches of lilacs and purples pervading it.    On June 9, 1880, previous
to attempting to ascend the mountains from the north,         Iencamped
against a huge block of trachyte (15,446 feet), from which        I
                                                                 took the
specimen   A.   The  Carrels, on their ascent, brought  from the  highest
rock visible, in situ (close to the summit), the specimen    B, and also
four specimens of debris from the same spot.”
   From Illiniza <U+FB01>ve specimens have been examined; one from the site
of the camp on the north side, and four from the summit, whereof
one was from rock in situ.      The <U+FB01>rst, A, is a moderately dark-grey,
slightly vesicular “trachyte,” containing      crystals of glassy felspar
sometimes     (though rarely) nearly 7,1—inch diameter, and some small
<U+FB02>akes of black mica. A slice shows a base of clear glass thickly studded
with acicular microliths (probably in part at least felspar) and granules
of ferrite and opacite, so that when viewed with low powers it has
a  brownish-grey, <U+FB01>nely granular aspect.       In this ground-mass are
scattered abundantly crystals of felspar varying from about '1 inch
downwards, together with very numerous lath-shaped crystallites often
about '004 long.      The larger, as usual, appear to be closely allied to
labradorite.     They have often externally a worn corroded or broken
look; internally they vary much; some are nearly clear, many have a
 few microlithic enclosures or spots of brown glass, a few are very full
of irregular patches of the latter; zonal banding  is often well exhibited.
There is   a little brown mica, some very characteristic hornblende, also
brown-coloured, and a considerable quantity of granules and small
 crystals of a pyroxenic mineral, some of which,     I    think, are mono
 clinic augite, but others appear to be orthorhombic, and are probably
 hypersthene. There are the usual granules of magnetite, and some
 minute colourless crystallites which may be apatite. The rock accord
 inglyis  a hornblendic augite-andesite, containing also some mica and
hyperstheue.
   The specimens from the summit are more scoriaceous and of              a
redder colo'ur.   One (debris) is more compact than the others, and of
a dull brick-red colour, spotted with small crystals of whitish felspar.
The others are very similar, being a rough scoriaceous rock, containing
felspar crystals similar to but not quite so large as those of the rock
described above.      In one  is an irregular branching tube or vein,
coated with a dull greenish or brownish glass, which      I   suspect to he
a fulgurite. I    have  only had  a slice  cut from the specimen broken
from the rock in situ (B). It is not in a good condition for examination,

   “ This is probably    the tenth in altitude of the Ecuadorian Andes,‘ and
is situated about north-north-east       of the cone of Cotopaxi at a distance
0f 11 miles, and lies nearly east of the town of Machachi (whence it
is visible) at a distance of 13 miles. The culmination of this moun
tain  is a long ridge, rising at its highest point into a very sharp tooth.
to the summit of which we ascended, but were prevented whilst there
from taking any observations by the occurrence of a severe thunder
storm. We made a precipitate retreat, remaining only long enough
to secure a couple of specimens.”
   One of these, a portion of the actual summit, is a compact dark
coloured rock, with a slightly rough fracture, containing numerous
small crystals of whitish felspar, generally not exceeding 'l inch in
the longer diameter.         Under the microscope, the ground-mass is
seen to be a felted mass of minute elongated crystallites, probably
felspar, and of specks of opacite; there is probably a residual
glassy base, but so numerous are the crystallites that it is by no
means easy to be sure.          In this ground-mass are scattered larger
crystals   of plagioclastic felspar similar to those already described,
augite, with probably some hypersthene (but it is not abundant),
and magnetite.        The rock is thus an augite-andesite, probably hyper
stheniferous.     The other specimen taken in situ from the summit
peak, a little below the highest point, is so evidently a rock of similar
character, that     I  have thought it needless to have a specimen pre
pared for microscopic examination.

line from Quito, being a little east of north, and from that city forms
a prominent object.         From the closer towns of Cotocachi, Otovalo,

    “There is no regularly     formed crater upon the south, west, or
eastern sides of Cotocachi.    I cannot speak of the northern and north
western sides, which I have only seen from comparatively low ground
at a considerable distance.
    “ In the neighbourhood of the mountain Cotocachi the surface of the
earth is more <U+FB01>ssured than any other part of Ecuador.        The district
about Cotopaxi, to which      I  have adverted when speaking of that
mountain, alone presents anything comparable to the extraordinary
series of chasms which seam or star the soil in the central portion of
the <U+FB02>at land of the Province of Imbabura. From below, the handler
is made aware of their existence by occasionally having to skirt their
sides for several miles, in a direction, perhaps, the very contrary of
that which he desires to take ; but their full extent is only perceived
when one looks down upon the <U+FB02>at land from a considerable elevation,
and then it is ,seen that the whole country in this vicinity is <U+FB01>ssured
by earthquake cracks, often several miles long, and sometimes
hundreds of feet across.
    “ T his
              neighbourhood has experienced very severe earthquakes
during the last few centuries, the most recent happening shortly
after midnight on August 16, 1868.        Several persons independently
pointed out to me a <U+FB01>ssure, which had opened on this occasion,
not less than 5 miles long, and varying in width from a few yards to
several hundreds of feet.      This earthquake was an affair of a few
seconds, and in that brief interval almost the whole buildings within
10 miles were ruined, and tens of thousands perished.       The priest of
Cotocachi town informed me that that place was totally destroyed—
not a single house being left erect. At Ibarra (about 13 miles distant
from the mountain), Senor T. Gomez de la Torre, the greatest landed
proprietor of this region, informed me that there were lists extant
showing that 20,000 persons perished in that town alone—a statement
that is scarcely credible, as the       of Ibarra has not the appearance
                                   town
of a place with so considerable a number of inhabitants.      Respecting
the widespread havoc which was caused on this single occasion, there
is not, however, any question.     The towns of Otovalo and Cotocachi
had well nigh been rebuilt; but, at the time of my visit, most of the
public edi<U+FB01>ces of Ibarra still remained in ruins, including schools, the
hospital, a convent, and six churches, besides the church of the
Jesuits, the <U+FB01>nest building in the town, and the most imposing edi<U+FB01>ce
I  saw in Ecuador.”
    From this peak two specimens have been brought by Mr. Whymper
——one from the summit rock, another from about 200 feet below it.
The former is a purplish-grey rock, containing small whitish felspar
crystals, with a good many minute vesicles.        These have made the
preparation of a slice a rather dif<U+FB01>cult task, and it is not so thin as 1
could desire. The ground-mass, however, appears to consist- of a glassy

 base, containing minute crystallites, probably for the most part felspar,
 but perhaps also a pyroxenic mineral, with rods of opacite and with
  ferrite staining.  In this occur crystals of plagioclastic felspar, not
 generally exceeding '03 inch, agreeing in general character with those
 already described, but perhaps more frequently containing enclosures,
 and “dirty looking,” together with a pyroxenic mineral.      The crystals
 of this are not very characteristic, but 1 think both augite and hyper
 sthene can be identi<U+FB01>ed. The other specimen is a small, rather rounded
 fragment, of a darker and more vesicular lava than the last, but with
 the usual whitish felspar crystals.    The ground-mass, except in the
 thinnest sections, is practically opaque, but in those it is seen to be a
 light brown glass studded with crystallites, as already described, and
 containing specks of opacite. There are the usual larger crystals of
 plagioclastic felspar, perhaps rather cleaner than in the case of the
 other rock, with crystals of a pyroxenic mineral, among which, 1 think,
.both the monoclinic and the orthorhombic species may be recognised.

 previous travellers in Ecuador.        Reiss and Stiibel appear to have seen
 it, for in their list of altitudes they mention that they made its height
 6,800 metres (15,748 feet) by A in the year 1871, but they seem to

 in elevation of those which I explored) occupied a greater length of
 time and gave more labour than any other, excepting Chimborazo.
 It will be enough to state in these notes that as we proceeded to the
 east we travelled out of the volcanic region of the Ecuadorian Andes
 and entered the older formations, passing through dense vegetation,
 which for a time entirely obscured the rocks.       We encamped several
'days under the <U+FB01>rst rock that we came across—a large projecting
 cli<U+FB01>' of mica-schist, situated almost exactly upon the Equator, at the
 height of 12,000 feet above the sea, which bears the name Gov-realm
fllfachai : and waiting until we could see Sara-urcu, which was almost
 perpetually enveloped in clouds, reached the summit at length on
 April 17, 1880. There was a rudely level ridge of some length at
 the summit, upon which a considerable amount of rock in situ was
 exposed. which left no doubt as to the nature of this mountain.
 The glaciers we traversed on the west of the peak possessed small
 but very distinct moraines, and from the moraine matter, which
 evidently had been borne from various rocks cropping up through
 the ice,   I collected various other specimens of mica schists and
 quartz, but could not detect a single fragment of the characteristic
 rocks which you have described in connexion with the other moun
 tains—the active and extinct volcanoes of the Equator.”
     The specimen from Cor'redor Macha'i is a rude <U+FB02>at slab of rock which,
 macroscopically, most resembles a rather <U+FB01>ne-grained micaceous gneiss.
 The slaty formation is evidently due to a rough cleavage traversing
 the rock, on he planes of which a silvery mica. has been rather largely
  developed.    Under the microscope the specimen is seen to contain the
 following minerals z—A silvery mica in scales, up to '03 inch long,
lprobably a hydrous alkaline-mica; a dull green mica (or, perhaps, in
  some cases a chlorite), much less abundant; numerous granules of
  quartz, with rather even sides and rectilinear outline, a colourless
  mineral, sometimes rather dusty-looking from included granules of
  opacite. This appears to have two not very well marked cleavages
  (indicated often rather by a constancy in the direction of included

  di<U+FB02>icult to decide upon the true nature of this mineral—andalusite
  and kyanite are the two which suggest themselves—and as           I can get
  no evidence of   its being  orthorhombic, I think  it more   probably a not
  very characteristic variety of the latter; there is apparently at one
  end of the slide a portion of a vein of a similar mineral in a less
  pure condition; the long-bladed crystals, so often characteristic of
  kya-nite, do not occur.    The structure also of the rock is perplexing;

1884.]     Moroscopic Structure of     some Rocks   from Ecuador.      403
it must undoubtedly be classed with the crystalline schists, but          I
suspect that the very marked schistosity is a secondary development
due to crushing.
   From the débris on the peak of Sara-urea one specimen has been
examined. It is a fairly <U+FB01>ssile mica-schist consisting mainly of a
silvery mica in rather small <U+FB02>akes, with apparently a quartzose or feis
pathic constituent.    Under the microscope there appear to be two micas
—0ne, far the most abundant, a rather light yellowish-green colour, the
other colourless. There is a moderate amount of rather clear quartz,
containing occasional small microliths, probably of the former mica,
and very minute cavities. There is some calcite, which often includes
a minutely granular earthy-lookin g material rather clustered together.
The layers of mica exhibit a kind of foliation, but the actual <U+FB02>akes are
often (though not always) athwart the layers; this, together with
other indications in the slide, leads me to suspect that the rock sub
sequently to its foliation has been compressed in a direction making a
considerable angle with the original foliation planes.
   Another specimen is a rather friable schist, consisting chie<U+FB02>y of a
dark green, or nearly black mica, with a <U+FB01>nely granular green mineral,
        I
which have little doubt is epidote; there is also a little of a silvery
mica.    A third specimen is a piece of a quartz vein, from a rock
identical with the last mentioned.      Three other specimens from Sara
 urcu, one broken from rock in situ on the summit, were examined
macroscopically by myself soon after Mr. Whymper's return, but have
since been unfortunately mislaid.       The summit rock appeared to me
a rather <U+FB01>ne-grained gneiss, containing quartz, felspar, dark mica,
with probably a little chlorite and epidote. Another was a schist, in
which   I  distinguished quartz, dark mica, and a silvery micaceous
mineral resembling sericite. The third was a vein specimen from a
rock corresponding with the last named.         I remarked in a letter to
Mr. Whymper at that time :——“ These specimens prove the existence
of true metamorphic rocks, which are in about the same condition as
                                      ‘               ’
many of those in what is called the newer gneiss series of the Scotch
Highlands.”
    A specimen from the moraine on the west side of Sara-urcu has been
examined microscopically.      It is a dull-coloured rock, which consists
of  a micaceous    mineral with silvery lustre, and a dark mineral in
small grains, being evidently a rather minutely constituted member of
the group of the spotted schists (fruchtschiefer).      The lustrous aspect
is visible on the faces of the rough divisional planes; on cross frac
tures there is little lustre, and the rock has a slightly friable aspect.
Under the microscope, what we may call the ground-mass of the rock
consists of <U+FB01>lms of a- very pale brown, almost colourless micaceous
mineral, felted together in wavy folia, and interspersed with numerous
 specks of ferrite and occasional small granules of quartz; in this are

opacite and by minute specks of a yellowish mineral.                        It sometimes

rather “ bladed           aspect, commonly, as it seems, four-sided, often
about '02 or ‘025        inch    long, and about one-fourth t0 one-eighth the
breadth. There is a clearly marked, though not frequent, basal
cleavage, making a large angle with the sides.                  The mineral is a very
pale   greenish-yellow       in colour,   rather  granular   in  aspect, contains occa
sionally enclosures       of  opacite, &c., and gives moderately bright colours
with the Nicols. Though extinction takes place at a rather small angle
with the sides of the prism, the mineral is clearly neither uniaxial nor
orthorhombic.         It is not unlike an epidote, but I do not think it belongs
to this group;       moreover,      there is nothing in the macroscopic aspect
of the rock to suggest the presence of epidote, the glimmering scaly
mica and the rather lustrous spots of a black mineral being all that is
 visible with a strong lens.          I   suspect that these minerals are rather
nearly    related,   and    both   belong to the group of anhydrous alumina
silicates—varieties, perhaps, of <U+FB01>brolite or kyanite. Unfortunately my
collection is not well provided with specimens containing these non
alkaline alumina silicates, so that           I  am unable to give a more precise
de<U+FB01>nition.        The   rock,    however,     evidently belongs to the “ frucht
schiefer” group, and I should conjecture has come from rather high
up in a metamorphic series, probably occupying a position above
 those already described.
    It is then'evident that, as Mr. Whymper asserts, Sara-urcu has no
 claim to be called a volcanic mountain.               All the specimens which he
 has brought from it are metamorphic rocks.                       They do not, indeed,
 belong to the earliest types, such as the coarse gneisses of the Hebrides,
 but still they are greatly altered.               Unless there were very clear
 evidence to the contrary, I should regard them as members of the

   This specimen was taken by Mr. Whymper from a boulder in the
bed   of the S. Jorge River, at the place where the ordinary track
from Bodegas to Quito crosses the stream a little above the village of
 Mu<U+FB01>apamba, about 1350 feet above the sea, and at the commencement
of the ascent of the Paci<U+FB01>c slopes of the outer range of the Andes.
This was the only place where Mr. Whymper found any rock resem
bling a. granite, and he nowhere saw it in situ. It is macroscopically
a fairly coarse granite-like rock in which a whitish felspar and dark
green hornblende are the more conspicuous minerals.                 Under the
microscope     it is seen to consist  of the  following   minerals  z—Felspar,
which in the great majority of cases exhibits either zonal banding
or polysynthetic twinning, and may,           I  think, be safely regarded as
principally oligoclase; hornblende with well characterised cleavage
and external angles; a brown mica, sometimes                   almost opaque,
frequently in aggregated <U+FB02>akes; quartz in granules, as in a granite,
containing many <U+FB02>uid-cavities from “0001 to '0003 inch, in which
commonly are bubbles occupying about 1} or % of their volume,
magnetite, or perhaps in some cases ilmenite, possibly a little apatite.
The hornblende appears to have crystallised nearly simultaneously with
the felspar, but perhaps a little earlier, the quartz last of all. The
rock is in moderately good preservation.           It has macroscopically and
microscopically a considerable resemblance to the typical tonalite of
the Adamello district.
                                     Granite.
   There is a small specimen of this rock of which Mr. Whymper
writes :—
                                    I
   “At the town of Bodegas found a specimen of granite in the

gave me a fragment from it. He told me that he had collected it
in situ on the track leading from the town of Riobamba (9000 feet) to
                                                     I
the village of Ba<U+FB01>os (590-5 feet, R. & S.), but could not learn at what
altitude it was taken. The locality is in latitude a little north of
the spot at which the last described specimen was collected, and is

very    well     preserved. Microscopic examination shows that there is
nothing exceptional in its composition.                         The felspar is a good deal
decomposed, but orthoclase pretty certainly predominates, though a
plagioclastic felspar is also present.                      There is a fair quantity of
quartz (containing many cavities, decidedly smaller than those in the
tonalite, which are usually empty) together with dark brown mica and
green hornblende, and some magnetite.

    II. S.G.=2'620.       Loss on heating 0'01.      From a dark andesite,

plagioclase. From the crater of Guagua Pichincha.
    It is evident that this felspar contains more silica and soda, and
less lime than normal labradorite, of which in Dana’s table of analyses
       “ Mineralogy,” s.v.
(see                         Labradorite) the greatest amount of silica is
given as 55'8, while the NaQO more often lies below than above 5, and the
 CaO ranges from 8 to nearly 13, and rather usually exceeds 9 per cent.
Still, as the name andesine is by no means universally accepted, and
it is extremely dif<U+FB01>cult to say what constitutes a species in felspar, I
have throughout designated these larger felspars in the Andes rocks
as labradorite, with which in their optical characteristics they appear
to correSpond very nearly.
    A comparison of this paper of Professor vom Bath’s (which had       I
unfortunately overlooked when writing my notes on Antisana), with
 one by Professor Theod. Wolf in the
                                           “ Neues Jahrbuch ” (1874,
                                                                     p. 377)
 shows that the pit-chstones examined by myself came from the same
 vicinity as that described by Professor vom Rath in the note to which
 I referred in Part II. Professor Wolf states that quartz-andesite (which
 it will be remembered does not occur in its normal condition in
 Mr. Whymper’s collection) is found at Achupallas, on Antisana, and
 to the south of Riobamba, as well as at the volcano of Mojanda.             It
 forms the whole hill of Achupallas (12,402 feet), and is largely
 developed on Antisana.        He mentions among the localities Urcucuy
 and Tablarumi, and speaks of a wonderful perlite lava-stream as
 occurring on Urcucuy, a hill “im Paramo, nicht weit nnter dem
 Antisana-kegel."     It is, therefore, evident that the specimens of pitch
 stone brought by Mr. \Vhymper (obtained from a collector) came from
 this district, since they bear the label Quebmda de Urcucuy. Professor
 vom Rath gives an analysis of the glassy part of the rock (I), with a
 separate one of the spherulites (ll).

    As the descriptions of these rocks from the Ecuadorian Andes have
had to appear separately, it may be convenient to conclude this series
of notes by a brief summary in a tabular form of the volcanic pro
ducts of which I have described the microscopic structures.
    It will also serve to impress upon us the general uniformity of the
rocks occurring in the district. This was so obvious to Mr. Whymper,
that be deemed it needless to bring many specimens from the
mountains which he visited in the latter part of his journey.                           Yet the
area which they occupy is a large one.                  From Altar and Chimborazo,
the most southerly pair, which lie on an IE.S.E.—W.N.W. line, about
40 miles apart (passing by Carihuairazo) to Cotopaxi and Illiniza
(on nearly the same parallel of latitude) is rather more than 60 miles.
Next come Corazon, Sincholagua, and Antisana (also roughly on an
east and west line, the <U+FB01>rst being not much less than 40 miles from
the third).       Passing northward by Pichincha (N.W. of Quito), we
leave on the east, Cayambe, which is a few miles east of the longitude
of Antisana, and <U+FB01>nally reach Cotocachi, the most northerly volca_nic
summit, having traversed a zone whose extreme length cannot be
less than 130 miles from N. to S., and whose greatest breadth from
east to west must be about 4-0 miles.‘|'                   If, as some think, volcanic
rocks are but sedimentary deposits melted down, this general
uniformity is rather remarkable.
   " Zirkel (“ Microsc. Bescha<U+FB01>,“ p. 448) says that he'has not 'found free quartz
under the microscope in the so-called augite-andesitcs, but I do not understand
whether he includes among them the rocks mentioned by Professor Wolf as occurring
on the west side of Antisana. The composition and structure of the pitchstones
described above make the occurrence of dacite in the highest degree probable,'but               I
have not myself noticed free quartz in any of' the ordinary Andes rocks.                 I regret

article, to be more probably allied to dacite than to rhyolite.

        Sounds.” By J. F. BULLAR, M.B. Cantab, F.R.C.S. Com
       municated by Dr. LAUDER BRUNTON, F.R.S.                  Received
       October 30, 1884.
    A   detailed account of the various existing theories of the produc
 tion of the respiratory sounds may      be found in Dr. Paul Nierneyer’s
 “ Handbuch der
                   Percussion und Anscultation ” (Erlangcn, 1870).
    The various theories, though di<U+FB02>'ering in minor points, may be
 arranged under three principal heads.
    A. According to the <U+FB01>rst the sounds are produced all along the
respiratory tract by the friction of the air against its walls.
    B. According to the second the sounds are produced at the glottis
 alone, and the differences in the sounds heard over the trachea and
 lungs are attributed to the greater or less conducting power of the
 structures through which they are heard at each spot.
    C. According to the third theory the sounds are produced at those
 parts of the respiratory tract where the air passes from a narrower to
 a wider space.    Thus during inspiration one sound is produced at the
 glottis, and another at the points where the smallest bronchioles
 open into the vesicles.     During expiration a sound is produced at
 the glottis only.
    The sounds are represented diagrammatically in the <U+FB01>gure.

412     Mr.  J. F. Bullar.   Experiments   to  Determine the     [New 27,
   As neither of  the above theories is universally   accepted, the experi
ments about to be described were undertaken         in the hope of deter
mining in what parts of the respiratory       tract the breathing sounds
are produced, and of deciding which, if any, of the above-mentioned
theories is the true one.
    The experiments were, for the most part, performed with the
arti<U+FB01>cial thorax represented in <U+FB01>g. 2. This consisted of an air-tight
chamber A, with glass sides <U+FB01>xed upon a <U+FB01>rm wooden bench.             From
the chamber A, a large smooth hole passed through the .bench into a
secondary chamber C, the sides of which were made of <U+FB02>exible
 india-rubber cloth, like a bellows. The upper edge of the ;india-rubber
 was fastened air-tight to the lower surface of the bench round the
 hole leading into the chamber A. The bottom of the bellows B was
 attached to the handle D, moving on a hinge at E. At the bottom
 of the bellows was the tap F.
    Near the middle of the roof of the chamber was a hole H large
 enough to admit a sheep’s or calf’s lung when collapsed.           A tap I
  and the tube of the <U+FB02>exible stethoscope L also passed through the
 roof, the inner end of the stethoscope being covered with bladder to
  prevent the escape of air or water through it.

 1884.]             Origin of  the Respiratory Sounds.               413
    The lower tap being shut, and water poured into_ the chamber till
it was nearly full, the arti<U+FB01>cial chest was ready to receive the lungs.
    The right lungs of calves and sheep have a small supernumerary
 bronchus arising from the trachea about 2 inches above its bifurcation.
 The left lung was therefore always chosen to be placed in the chamber,
 and this was accomplished by passing the lung between the two parts
of the sliding frame shown in <U+FB01>g. 3, and then bringing the parts
 together, so that the left bronchus passed without pressure through
the hole formed by the two notches in the sides of the frame at N.
 One lung was then above and the other below the frame, as shown in
 pro<U+FB01>le in <U+FB01>g. 4.
                                   Fig. 4.
   The inner end of the stethos00pe L was attached to the lower lung
by tying it to the fold of pleura running down the back of the lung,
and the lung and stethoscope were passed into the chamber through
the hole in its roof.

414      Mr. J. F. Bullar.   Experiments  to Determine the    [Nov. 27,
    The frame (<U+FB01>g. 3) was screwed down air-tight upon a ring of india
 rubber tube placed round the hole in the roof of the chamber A, and
 the interval between the left bronchus and the frame stopped up
 by wrapping some tow, dipped in a strong solution of gelatine, round
 the bronchus.
    The Whole chamber containing the lung was now air-tight, and by
                           I
 opening the upper tap and raising the handle of the bellows, any
 air remaining above the water in the chamber or any super<U+FB02>uous
 water could be expelled.
                   I
    When the tap was shut, moving the handle up and down caused
 the lung within the chamber to breathe, and by <U+FB01>xing the handle in
 different positions the lung could be kept motionless at different
 degrees of distension.
    The chamber thus represented a thorax in which there was a
suf<U+FB01>cient amount of <U+FB02>uid to separate the surfaces of the lung and
chest wall, and in which the respiratory movements were entirely
                                                     ‘
diaphragmatic.
    The motion of the machine itself and of the water contained in it
produced no sound.
    The object and results of the experiments about to be described
will be made clearer by introducing here a short account of the
respiratory sounds, and as the changes in the sounds produced by
alterations in the physical condition of the lungs throw light upon
their origin, a short account of the more important of these changes
is also necessary.
   The sounds to be considered may be divided into those of speech
and those of respiration.
   A. The sounds of speech are produced in the mouth and larynx.
They are heard loudly and distinctly by the stethoscope over the
larynx and trachea; over the parts of the chest in contact with the
vesicular structure of the lungs they are weaker and indistinct.
   In the neighbourhood of the large air passages, e.g., in the inter
scapular space, the sounds are less weak and indistinct than at other
parts of the chest, and approach more nearly in character to the
sounds heard over the trachea.
    B. The origin of the respiratory sounds is a disputed point.
    Over the trachea during both inspiration and expiration a rushing
sound is heard.
    Over the lungs a sound is heard during inspiration of a different
character from the tracheal inspiratory sound, and during expiration
the sound is either very faint 0r altogether absent.
    As in the case of the voice there may be, in the neighbourhood of
 the large air passages, an approximation to the tracheal sounds.
    The sounds heard over the lungs are known as the sounds of
“ vesicular breathing.”

1884.]               Origin of  the Respiratory  Sounds.              415
    Changes in the physical condition of the lungs alter the sounds
either in intensity or in character, or in both, or the sounds may be
altogether absent from parts where they are normally heard. Over
parts of the lung which have become consolidated, or destroyed and
replaced by air, and in certain other conditions, the normal sound
of vesicular breathing is replaced by an inspiratory and expiratory
sound, having more the character of the sounds heard over the
trachea.    These altered sounds di<U+FB01>er in character according to the
physical changes in the lungs, but they have the common feature
distinguishing them from the sounds of vesicular breathing, that the
expiratory sound instead of being much weaker is equal to or more
intense than the inspiratory sound.
                                                             “           ”
    Sounds having this peculiarity are classed together as bronchial
sounds; they resemble more or less the sounds normally heard over
 the trachea.
    Many different qualities of bronchial breathing may be heard and
 have received different names, but for the present purpose, it will
 be sufficient to remember their common feature, namely, that the
 expiratory sound is as loud or louder than the inspiratory.
    When the lungs are partially consolidated or otherwise changed, an
 alteration of the vesicular sound is often noticed over the una<U+FB01>ected
 parts of the lungs.      The alteration consists in an increase in the
 intensity of both the inspiratory and expiratory sounds.
     When the vesicular sound is thus intensi<U+FB01>ed it is said to be
 “ puerile ” in character, the vesicular breathing of a child being louder
 than that of an adult.
    Besides the above alterations in the breathing sounds, certain
 accessory sounds, such as those due to <U+FB02>uid in the air passages, and
 to friction of the pleural surfaces, &c., may be present.
    The sound of the voice heard over physically altered lung differs
 both in intensity and in character from the sound heard over unaltered
 lung, and so far as this change does not correspond to any alteration
 in the voice sounds produced in the larynx and mouth, it must be due
 to changes in the conducting power of the parts through which the
 sounds are heard.
    With regard to the changes in the breathing sounds the case is not
 so simple, for, as we do not know where the normal sounds originate,
 it is impossible to say how much the changes due to altered conduction
 may be supplemented by changes in the sounds produced.
    In the rest of this paper the terms vesicular, bronchial, and puerile
 breathing will be used, in the sense just indicated, in order to save the
 constant repetition of descriptions of the sounds.
    When the left lung is placed, as described above, in the arti<U+FB01>cial
 thorax, the right lung lies upon the top of the chamber collapsed,
 and is unaffected by the respiration going on in the left.

    The trachea must be kept straight, and placed so that the air can
freely pass in and out of it.*
    The sounds heard in the two lungs are quite diiferent.
    Listening to the inner lung with the <U+FB02>exible stethoscope the breath
ing sound is quite distinct, and resembles vesicular breathing, the
expiratory being very faint compared with the inspiratory sound.
    Altering the size of the opening of the trachea does not sensibly
affect this sound unless the narrowing be carried so far as to interfere
with the entrance of air, when the sound becomes more feeble.
    In the outer lung, in which the air is motionless, both inspiration
and expiration are loud, the breathing is bronchial.
    The sound is loudest over the larger bronchial tubes, but it is
quite distinct as far as the edges of the lung.              On compressing the
bronchus leading to the lung the sound ceases to be heard.
    If the trachea be plugged while the inner lung is in a state of
inspiration and the machine kept in motion, both lungs breathe, expi
ration and inspiration alternating in the two.
   The breathing sound in the outer lung now becomes “ vesicular,”
changing to bronchial whenever the trachea is opened, and it ceases
to breathe. The same result follows whether the trachea be left long
or cut o<U+FB01> and plugged close to the bifurcation.
    These experiments show that the vesicular murmur is not pro
duced in the glottis or trachea alone, since it continues when the
larynx and nearly the whole of the trachea are removed, and when
the trachea being plugged and the lungs breathing from one to the
other, there is no current of air through what is left of the trachea.
    With regard to the bronchial sounds in the outer non-breathing
lung, it is well known that a current of air passing over but not
entering the mouth of a tube produces a sound, which, under certain
circumstances, may become a musical note, and that in cases where
the sound is a noise rather than a note, that by listening carefully a
note may be detected through the rushing noise.                     This is exactly
the character POSSessed by the Sound of bronchial breathing;                        we
easily recognise, in different cases, notes of different quality and
pitch.
    In the non-breathing lung of the experiment, or in             a case  of morbid
consolidation, this condition is realised, the air-current passes down
   * The butchers usually remove the larynx from the trachea before the lungs are
sold, and in the following experiments     the larynx was absent.    There were three
reasons for my not objecting to this :—
   lst. A dead larynx is a very different thing from a living one.
   2nd. The vocal cords of calves and sheep are less developed than those of man.
   3rd. A murmur is produced at the cut end of the trachea.      It will be seen in the
 sequel that the reasoning of the present paper is unaifected by the absence of the
larynx.

the trachea to the healthy parts of the lungs, and on its way blows
across the mouths of the bronchial tubes leading to the consolidated
parts without entering them.
    There is, therefore, an d prim-i probability that this may be the
origin of some part of the sound of bronchial breathing, and in order
to determine whether it is so, the following experiment was tried :—
                                   FIG. 5.
    A Y-tube of gutta-percha, the stem about one inch and the arms
 about half-an-inch in internal diameter, was made to represent the
lower part of the trachea, and its bifurcation into the two bronchi.
 The arms were each continued by an india-rubber tube about six
 inches long, and to the ends of the india-rubber tubes equal sized bags
 of gntta-percha tissue were attached as represented in the <U+FB01>gure.
                                                                '
 The inside of the whole apparatus was smooth.
     The arti<U+FB01>cial thorax being <U+FB01>lled with air, the tubes, with the bags
 attached, were let through the roof of the chamber as far as the dotted
 line in the <U+FB01>gure.
    At each downward and upward stroke of the bellows air entered
 and escaped from the bags through the tubes, as shown by the
 direction of the arrows.    The movement of the bellows was so regu
 lated as to  completely <U+FB01>ll and empty the bags at each stroke.
     During the inspiration and expiration thus caused, a feeble sound
 was heard, no doubt produced at the open ends of the tubes, the
  loudness of the sounds depended upon the force with which the

418    Mr.       J. F.   Bullar.   Experiments   to    Determine the   [Nov. 27,
respirations were performed, and by working with a proper force the
sound could be made very faint indeed. If, when this was the case,
one of the smaller tubes was nipped, so as to prevent any air passing
through     while continuing to work the bellows with the same force,
           it,
the sounds became greatly increased.
   The expiratory sound was increased more than the inspiratory, and
at the same'time the character of the sound changed,    note could be
                                                                 a

                 it                    the part of the tube pinched,

tion the higher being the pitch.
   The sounds could be heard either at the mouth of the large tube
(trachea) or with the stethoscope in the obstructed and unobstructed
tubes (bronchi).
   In this experiment      the bellows be worked at a uniform rate, the
                             if
rate of the air-current in the large tube will not be appreciably
affected by the stoppage of one of the smaller tubes.          (If altered    it
will be diminished on account of the slight increase of friction.)
The rate of the air-current through the trachea being unchanged
by the stoppage of a bronchus, the increase of sound cannot be
produced in the glottis.       We must seek therefore in some part of
the respiratory tract below the trachea for the origin of the sound
caused by bronchial obstruction.          The stoppage of one bronchus,
although    not  a<U+FB01>ecting  the   rate  of the  air-current in the trachea,
doubles its rate     in the  free   bronchus,  for when one bronchus          is
shut all the air entering the trachea passes through the free bronchus,
and <U+FB01>lls the bag (lung) belonging to            in the same time in which
                                                 it
the two bags would have been half-<U+FB01>lled had both the bronchi
been free.     The stoppage of one bronchus not only increases the rate
of the air-current in the other, but produces conditions for the
 development of a new sound at the bifurcation of the trachea, for as
the air passes along the free bronchus            blows across the mouth of
                                                  it
 the obstructed tube,    and   a  current  of air crossing the mouth of a
tube produces a sound. A sound produced in this way, like the sound
 in the experiment, varies according to the length of the tube blown
across, a rushing noise is produced at the mouth of the tube, and the
 tube, according to its length, brings into prominence some particular
 note present in the noise, and so modi<U+FB01>es its character.
    By working the bellows so as to completely <U+FB01>ll and empty the
 bags at each stroke, the same amount of air is made to pass through
 each small tube, whether the other be shut or open, but when one
 tube is  shut the whole act of inspiration or expiration comes to an end
 in half the time occupied when both the tubes are open.
    The important points to remember are—
 ‘
    First, that the obstruction of a bronchus upsets the ratio normally
 existing between the rates of the air-current in the di<U+FB01>erent parts of

                                                                   -
  1884.]               ()Ngin of  the Respiratoqy   Sounds.                419
 the respiratory tract.        The cross section of the respiratory tract
 increases from the trachea t0 the vesicles, just as the cross section of
 the circulatory system increases from the aorta to the capillaries, and
 the rate of the air-current varies accordingly.          When a larger or
 smaller bronchus is obstructed the cross sections of the bronchi and
 vesicles are more or less diminished, and the rate of the air-current
 in them proportionately increased, the rate in the trachea being
 unaffected by the obstruction as such.
    And, secondly, that when a bronchus is obstructed a sound is pro
 duced by the air passing over its mouth.
    The diminution in thetime occupied in inspiration and expiration,
 brought about by the obstruction of abronchus, is probably one cause
 of the increased frequency of respiration in cases where the lung is
 consolidated or compressed.
    With regard to the theory of the laryngeal production of bronchial
 breathing, it is to be observed that in a case of complete consolida
 tion of one lung each respiratory act must be performed in less than
  half the normal time before any increase in the rate of the air-current
 in the larynx and trachea, and therefore of the sound produced in
 them, can occur.                             -
                                                           ,
    Repeating   the   above  experiment  with  calves’ lungs, the same result
 was obtained. Both lungs were placed in the arti<U+FB01>cial thorax with
 the trachea and main bronchi above the cover.                011 compressing
 either of the bronchi a marked increase of sound was heard over the
 trachea, the increase in the expiratory sound being as before the
 greatest.   The shortness of the main bronchi made it impossible to
elicit different notes by compressing them at different points; but it is
probable that a partial consolidation by obstructing the smaller tubes
would produce a different note from that obtained by stopping the air
current in the main bronchus.
    The explanation of the fact that the expiratory is increased more
than the inspiratory sound appears to be the following :—
    During both inspiration and expiration a sound is produced by the
passage of the air over the mouth of the obstructed tube.              During
inspiration   this  is the  only new  sound produced,   the  air passing from
the trachea to the bronchus, that is, from a larger to a smaller tube,
as shown in <U+FB01>g. 6, but during expiration the air passes-from the
bronchus to the trachea—from a smaller to a larger tube—which, as
is well known, is a suf<U+FB01>cient cause to produce a sound.              Therefore
during inspiration 9. cause for the production of one, and during
expiration causes for the production of two new sounds are present.
    The passage of the air from the two smaller tubes into the larger
ones does not produce any considerable sound, for when they are
both open the expiratory and inspiratory sounds are much alike.
    It appears to me that in these experiments the conditions present

420     Mr.  J. F.   Bullar.    Ewperiments   to Determine the      [Nov. 27,
in the chest in health and in consolidation of the lung are represented
accurately enough for the purpose, and that they illustrate the way
in which bronchial breathing may be produced in extensive consolida
tion, and in any other conditions which give rise to a stasis of air
in  the bronchial tubes.
    In such cases a. new sound is produced at the unction 0f the obstructed
 with the unobstructed   tubes.   This sound does not ew'ist in health.
    If the respiratory organs themselves and the structures covering
 them were good conductors of sound, the sounds produced at any part
 would be heard at all other parts, and wherever we listened on the
 surface of the chest or throat, we should hear the combination of all
 the sounds produced at the time in the di<U+FB02>’erent parts.           For the dis
 tance between the most remote parts of the respiratory tract is so
 small that none but very feeble sounds would be entirely lost on that
 account, even if it were not the case that in a great part of this short
 distance the sound is conducted through tubes (trachea and larger
 bronchi), by which the eifect of distance is diminished.
     Of course each sound would bear a somewhat greater or less pro
 portion to the whole combination, as the point ausculted was nearer
 to or farther from the seat of its production, and thus there would be
 a di<U+FB01>erence of character in the resultant or combination sound at
 di<U+FB02>erent parts; it would, however, at all parts be a combination of
 the sounds produced in the di<U+FB01>erent parts of the tract.           The rate of
 the air-currents is so slow as to have no in<U+FB02>uence on the conduction
 of sound.
     The bronchial breathing produced in the arti<U+FB01>cial system of tubes
  was heard equally well in all the tubes.        In the body, however, this
  is not the case, the bronchial breathing heard over a consolidated
  lung is not recognised on the healthy side, owing to the feeble c0n~

  ducting power of distended lung; for the same reason the voice is
  heard less plainly on the healthy side.     In the living body we are
 listening to the sounds over a. distended lung in motion and permeated by
 air-currents, and in which possibly sound is being produced.
     In order to test the conducting power of distended lung at rest, the
 following experiment was performed.
    A pair of lungs were arranged in the arti<U+FB01>cial thorax in the way
 described in the <U+FB01>rst experiment, and in addition a large indie-rubber
 bag <U+FB01>lled with air was attached to the trachea by means of atube. By
 keeping the handle of the bellows <U+FB01>xed in any given position the lung
 within the chamber could be kept for a short time at any desired
 degree of distension, aud by pressing at intervals upon the bag, air
 could be forced to and fro between the bag and the lung outside the
 chamber, without distending the lung within it. When this was done
 the sound in the outer lung was vesicular in character, that in the
 inner non-breathing lung bronchial; but the intensity of the sound in
 the inner lung varied with its amount of distension, being loudest
when it was collapsed, and much fainter but still bronchial when it
was nearly fully distended.
    If, while the outer lung was being made to breathe from the bag,
the handle of the bellows was allowed to move, the two lungs breathed
together, and the sound in the inner lung at once increased, inspira
tion becoming much louder than expiration, and the sound acquired
the vesicular character.                                       \
    This experiment proves that the glottic and bronchial murmurs,
and any other sounds elsewhere produced, are heard but faintly
through a distended and motionless lung, and that their resultant
has the bronchial character, expiration being heard as plainly as
inspiration; and further, that the vesicular murmur is developed
during the distension of this lung still further by means of a current
of air. The only tenable explanation of these facts is that the vesicu
lar murmur is produced in the lung itself; for if it be not produced
in the lung it must be a conducted sound, and we have just seen that
expansion of the lung diminishes its conducting power; but the
peculiarity of the vesicular sound is that it is heard loudest during
inspiration, that is to say while the lung is expanding, and by so
doing becoming a worse conductor of sound.           The sound is loudest
when the conducting power of the lung is least; it cannot, there
fore, be a conducted sound.                        I
    The sound heard over the distended but motionless lung was the
combination of all the sounds produced in the respiratory tract greatly
reduced by bad conduction, and consisted of sounds produced in the
glottis, at the bifurcation of the trachea, and in the substance of the
breathing lung.
    In the present experiment the glottic sound was represented by the

422                  Mr. W.   F. R. Weldon.     Note on the       [Nov. 27,
sound produced at the junction of the trachea with the air bag.         The
origin   of the   sound  at the bifurcation has been discussed above.  That
a sound is produced in the breathing lung is proved by the experiment;
it seems probable that its cause is the passage of the air from the
small bronchi into the vesicles.
    In the living body, when there is stasis of air in a bronchus, the
new sound formed at the mouth of the bronchus must be added to the
pre-existing glottic and pulmonary sounds, and is no doubt one factor
in the production of puerile or exaggerated breathing; the increased
rapidity of motion of the air in the healthy lung being another.
    With regard to the production of the vesicular or as it may now be
called the pulmonary sound; if a lung be partially in<U+FB02>ated and the
bronchus tied it may be made to expand and contract freely by
placing it in an air-tight vessel completely <U+FB01>lled with water, and
communicating by means of a <U+FB02>exible tube with a vessel containing
mercury. Raising or lowering the mercury causes the lung to contract
and expand.         Under these circumstances there is no current of air
 through    the   bronchi;    as the vesicles are more extensible than the
 bronchial tubes, a slight current must enter them during expansion,
 but this appears to be insuf<U+FB01>cient to produce a sound, as none could
 be heard with certainty through a stethoscope applied directly to
 the lung. The experiment shows that the pulmonary sound is not due
 to the movements of the tissues of the lung.
    The results of the experiments now described are in accordance
 with the third theory quoted at the beginning of this paper, and the
 results of the vivisections performed on horses by Chauveau, Bondet,
 and Bergcon are con<U+FB01>rmed by my experiments, which show that the
 vesicular sound is produced in the lungs, and not in the glottis or
 trachea.
     The demonstration of the production of a new-sound in bronchial
 obstructi on   I  have not seen elsewhere.
 III. “Note       on the Origin      of the Suprarenal Bodies of Verte
        brates.” By W. F. R. WELDON, B.A. Communicated by
        Professor M. FOSTER, Sec. RS. Received October 30, 1884.
     In the early part of this year I was enabled, by the courtesy of the
 Royal Society, to examine some specimens of Bdellosz‘oma Forste'ri,
 collected by Mr. Sedgwick by means of a grant from the Society. As a
 result of this examination, it appeared that the head kidney, described
 by Johannes Miiller as connected, on the one hand with the segmental
  duct, and on the other by means of a branch of segmental tubules with
  the pericardium, had become modi<U+FB01>ed in a very peculiar manner. The

1884.]         Origin of     the Suprarenal Bodies of        Vertebrates.       423
connexion with the segmental duct, and the one or two glomeruli
(both shown by Wilhelm Miiller to exist in the embryo of Myxine)
had disappeared, all that remained being a plexus of tubules, opening
into the pericardium, but without any other opening whatever, and
entirely unconnected with the rest of the kidney. This plexus was
closely surrounded by a network of blood-vessels, and the larger
tubules contained altered blood-corpuscles.
    In seeking for a parallel, among other Vertebrates, to this peculiar
modi<U+FB01>cation of a portion of the kidney,            I was struck by the following
facts :—
    In Teleostei and Ganoids, Balfour has shown* that the head kidney
is often replaced, in the adult, by a mass of lymphatic tissue, richly
supplied with vessels. Emery has studied the development of this
tissue; he <U+FB01>nds in the embryo of many Teleostei, at an early stage, a
single pronephric funnel, communicating with the segmental duct;
the rest of the “intermediate cell-mass,” being an undi<U+FB01>erentiated
blastema surrounding the duct. In later development, only a portion
of this tissue becomes converted into renal tubules ; the rest remaining
                                     ”
through life as “lymphatic tissue, richly supplied with vessels.‘|'
   Now the Teleostei and the Cyclostomes are the only Vertebrates
devoid of suprarenals ; and where these latter organs exist, they are
always closely connected with the kidney, having, in reptiles and
                       “ vena
amphibians, a                   portes,” corresponding to the ,“ renal portal
system” of the kidney, and being in male reptiles situated in the
mesorchium, side by side with the longitudinal network of the testis.
   It therefore seemed worth while to re-examine the development of
the “ cortical” part of the suprarenal bodies.                This   I  have done in
Pristt'urus, in Lacerta, and in the chick, <U+FB01>nding it to be derived in each
case from a portion of the mesonephric tubules.
   In Lacerta muralis, the segmental vesicles, when they have become
connected by the usual m -shaped cords with the Wolffian duct, become
invaginated, and form glomeruli.- In the region of the future genera
tive ridge, as each glomerulus begins to invaginate, before a blood
vessel enters it, its mesenteric border (that opposite to the connexion
with the m-shaped segmental tube) thickens, and becomes more than
 one cell thick,—the rest of its wall being never, at any period of its
 existence, formed of more than a single layer of cells. As the genera
tive ridge develops, the thickened portion of each glomernlus increases,
 and gives rise to a process divided into two branches, one dipping
 ventralwards into the generative ridge, the other going dorsally
 between the kidney and the cardinal vein. Both branches are at <U+FB01>rst
 histologically indistinguishable,          being alike composed of rounded
 cells, pressed closely one against another.

   After a time, the dorsal branch becomes separated from the rest,
being cut off by numerous small veins, which divide its substance into
irregular trabeculaa. Its component cells also stain less easily than
those of the ventral branch of the glomerular process.    These dorsal
branches are, as shown by their position, and by their subsequent
union with processes from the neighbouring sympathetic ganglia, the
rudiment of the cortical portion of the suprarenal body, the ventral
processes forming the longitudinal network of the testis, already
described by Braun.
   The close contact which exists, in the later stages of development,
between the suprarenal rudiment and the various blood-vessels which
run through   it, has led previous observers to assume that the blastema
itself originates by proliferation of the walls of those vessels.        The
fact that the glomerular processes already mentioned may be easily
recognised before the existence of these vascular branches, together
with the great clearness and distinctness of the endothelium of the
latter, which may always be seen as a sharply de<U+FB01>ned layer lying
on the suprarenal substance, completely negative this view.
   The later behaviour of the cortical blastema, and its union with the
sympathetic, has been correctly described by Braun.
   In the chick the development is, as might be expected, much modi
 <U+FB01>ed.   About the end of the <U+FB01>fth day numbers of large, rounded,
deeply staining cells appear in the tissue between the vena cava and
the mesonephros.       These cells unite, during the sixth and seventh
days, into clusters and <U+FB01>nally into chains which acquire, on the eighth
day, a connexion with the epithelium of adjacent glomeruli.            After
this they behave in a manner practically identical with that of the
corresponding cords in the lizard.
   As in the lizard, so in the chick, the cells in question are from the
<U+FB01>rst so perfectly distinct from the walls of the adjacent vessels that
they can by no possibility be supposed to have been budded o<U+FB01>' from
them.
   In Pristin'rus, the suprarenals are, as    is   well known, segmentally
arranged along     _the  dorsal   wall  of  the  cardinal    veins.  Balfour
describes their cortical tissue as arising from an impaired rod of meso
blast, lying at the root of the mesentery. As to the origin of the
rod itself, he says nothing.      Its actual originI     believe to be this:
each segmental    tube, before  the  formation  of a glomerulus, gives offa
hollow bud, towards the root of the mesentery, so that it becomes
Y-shaped, the foot of the Y representing the peritoneal funnel, one
limb being the suprarenal bud, and the other the connexion with the
segmental duct. Almost immediately after its formation, the internal
limb of the Y breaks off, and fuses with its fellows to form the
unpaired rod at the root of the mesentery of which Balfour speaks.
   The results of these observations we may sum up by saying that all

Vertebrates, except Amphioxus, have a portion of the kidney modi<U+FB01>ed
for some unknown purpose not connected with excretion; that in
Cyclostomes the pronephros alone is so modi<U+FB01>ed, in Teleostei the pro
and part of the meso-nephros; while in Elasmobranohs and the
higher Vertebrates, the mesonephros alone gives rise to this organ,
which has also, in these forms, acquired a secondary connexion with
certain of the sympathetic ganglia.
IV. “The       Pupil-Photometer.”         By   J.  GORHAM, M.R.C.S.      Eng.
       Communicated by Dr. WILKS,              Fits.     Received Novem
       ber 18, 1884.
                                    (Abstract)
   It is agreed on all hands that the    pupil of the eye owes its size to the
quality   of the  light;   contracting  and dilating according to the inten
sities of the light.      It is not agreed, however, if indeed it has ever
become the subject of debate, that its magnitudes may be reciprocally the
measures   of those  intensities. There are cogent reasons for believing that
they are so. and hence that an instrument         which measures the pupil’s
size, measures at the same time the light’s intensity.       The photometer
was originally constructed for the former purpose only, and indicates
the diameter of the pupil in hundredths of an inch. The diameter is
found by directing the instrument applied to one eye, with both eyes
open, towards a sheet of white paper, or the sky; the lid of the
instrument is now revolved slowly until the two white disks jnst touch
one another at their edges.         The decimal fraction opposite the two
apertures seen on the scale outside, indicates the diameter of the pupil
in hundredths of an inch.
    On examining hourly for several consecutive weeks the light of the
day re<U+FB02>ected from a given small area of the sky, certain recurring
periodicities were observed in the pupil’s magnitudes, and these are
found to coincide with analogous alterations in the light’s intensity;
hence it was inferred that if the pupil owes its size to the intensity
of the light, it became from that very fact a measure of that intensity.
It is the object of the paper to substantiate this by experiment. To
use the instrument for testing light of di<U+FB01>erent intensities we <U+FB01>rst
set the pupil to a light of a given intensity by using a Sugg’s standard
candle.     This is placed at a distance of one foot from the eye, with a
white surface close behind it, in a darkened room. The diameter of
the pupil is now taken under the stimulus of the candle <U+FB02>ame, and its
measure is read off on the scale of the instrument.           My own pupil,
when impressed with such a light, measures invariably the 0'15 inch.
We now place four such candles at two feet from the eye, when the

  426             Mr.  J. Gorham.     The Papil-Photometer.    [Nov.  27,
 pupil will be found to remain stationary at the same magnitude as
 before.    These results are in strict accordance with the rule that the
 intensity of the illumination of any body, in the presence of a source
 of light, will depend upon its distance from that source, and obeys
 the general law of radiant forces, the intensity of the light varying
 inversely as the square of the distance of the luminous body.  Hence, if
 a single candle illuminates a body at one foot, four candles at two
 feet are required to produce equal illumination.
    It will be observed that the process of equalizing the illumination
 becomes at the same time the measure of the number of candles used
in the experiment. Hence, by an extension of the same principle, the
 candle-power of any luminous body may be found.            Thus, if one
candle at one foot is equal in intensity to four candles at two feet,
it will be similarly equal to nine candles at three feet; where the
number of candles in each case is found by taking the square of the
distance.     Let it be required, for instance, to take the candle-power
of a gas-<U+FB02>ame.       Suppose now that the distance required to equalize
the illuminations is equal to six feet, then the square of six being
equal to thirty-six, the brilliancy of the <U+FB02>ame will be equal to that of
thirty-six   candles.
    The fact of the pupil varying in different individuals under a light
of the same intensity, scarcely militates against the use of the instru
ment, for so far as observations extend it has been found that the
pupil in each person has a range of its own, and that while the
absolute numbers vary the ratios are the same.          (See Diagram in
paper.)
   In taking observations we are not conscious of exercising any
voluntary e<U+FB01>orts of our own with a view to controlling the pupil.
Its movements, on the contrary, are involuntary and instinctive.
Herein, doubtless, consists the certainty with which they are per
formed.

    The Treasurer then addressed the Society as follows :—
    The absence of our President from his post to-day must of necessity
cast a certain amount of gloom over the proceedings at this our
anniversary meeting, and, personally,       I feel additional regret that it
devolves upon me, as your Senior Vice-President and Treasurer, to be
the unworthy occupant of the Chair on the present occasion.              My
regret at the absence of the President is, however, in one respect
tempered by a strong hope, in which,          I  am sure, that you will all
fervently join,   that  the timely  retirement    from arduous work which
has   been   enforced upon   him   by   his medical advisers may produce
those bene<U+FB01>cial results which we all so cordially desire, and that we
may ere long again see among us our accomplished and valued
President in renewed health and strength.
    I  must, however, turn from the expression of our hopes for the
future, to that of our regrets for the past, and for a short time dwell
upon the mournful list of vacancies which the ever-active hand of
 death has caused in our ranks during the past twelve months. In
 one respect only can a topic of consolation be found in this list.
 It is that in extent it is less than that of last year, the total
 number of our deceased Fellows being only eighteen on the home
 list and three on the foreign list, while those numbers were twenty
 one and two respectively at our last anniversary.
     All three foreign members whose loss we have on the present occa
 sion to deplore were men of the highest distinction in chemical

   science.    Two were residents at Paris, both of whom had Chairs in the
   French Academy, of which the one had been since 1868 one of the
   Permanent Secretaries. I cannot dwell upon the discoveries and the
   remarkable career of M. Jean Baptiste André Dumas, whose energy and
   perspicuity even when past the limit of fourscore years, all those who
   of late have had the opportunity of being present at a meeting of the
   French Academy must have found reason to admire. ' An appre
   ciative memoir of him by one of our- own Fellows, who-of all men
  living is perhaps the best quali<U+FB01>ed to judge of the value of his
  labours—Professor Hofmann—written while Dumas was still among
  us, will be found in the pages of “Nature,”* and a biographical
  notice by the same hand has appeared in our own “Proceedings.”
  It will give some slight idea of the extent of time over which the
  labours of M. Dumas have extended if I mention that, soilong ago as
  in 1843, he received the Copley Medal at our hands, at altime when his
  chemical and physiological researches had already extended over a
  period of twenty-two years.            M. Dumas died at Cannes on the 11th
 of April last, and 'among the most touching of the speeches at his
 obsequies was that of M. Wiirtz, whose own decease took place on
 the 12th of the following month.
      Although nearly twenty years younger than M. Dumas, M. Karl
 Adolph VViirtz had for a longtime been one of the- most distinguished
 leaders of modern chemical science, especially in the department of
 organic chemistry, and his merits were recognised by this Society in
 1864, when he was elected one of our foreign members, and again in
 1881, when the Copley Medal was awarded to him.
      The third chemist on the foreign list whom we have lost is our
 Davy Medallist, Professor Kolbe, whose sudden death took place only
 on Wednesday last, and of whose merits                I  shall have to say a few
 words later on.
      Among our English Fellows was a contemporary of Wiirtz, who,
like him, had been a pupil of the illustrious Liebig, but whose bent
 was more on the practical than on the theoretical side of chemistry—
1 mean Dr. Angus Smith, whose of<U+FB01>cial labours in favour of pure air
and pure water combined both tact and zeal, and were productive of
highly bene<U+FB01>cial results.
     One other chemist has been taken from among us, Mr. Henry
Watts, the well-known editor of the “ Dictionary of Chemistry,” and
                                 “
of more than one issue of Fownes’s Manual.”
     Our other losses extend over various departments of science. . In
botany our ranks are thinned by the death of Dr. John Hutton
Balfour, formerly Professor of Botany at Glasgow and the Emeritus
Professor of that Chair in the University of Edinburgh; and of the

veteran Mr. George Bentham, who had nearly completed his eighty
fourth year.    During his long and varied experiences of life, botany
was his constant pursuit and study; and some thirty years ago, after
presenting his <U+FB01>ne collections and library to the Royal Gardens at
Kew, he devoted himself to labouring there on the Floras of Hong
Kong and Australia, and, in conjunction with Sir Joseph Hooker, on
the “ Genera Plantarum,” until his health gave way in the spring of
last year. The exceptional value of his botanical work was recognised
by this Society in 1859, when a Royal Medal was awarded to him,
and his regard for the Society has been testi<U+FB01>ed by his making a
bequest of 1,000l. to our Scienti<U+FB01>c Relief Fund.
   Among mathematicians we have lost Dr. Isaac Todhunter, whose
educational treatises have for many years been recognised as standard
works, and whose elaborate histories of different branches of mathe
matical science have earned for him a high reputation; and Mr.
Charles W. Merri<U+FB01>eld, who, in addition to achieving distinction by
his educational works on arithmetic and mathematics, did much in
the direction of the practical application of science, and at the Royal
School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering successfully
laboured in improving the stability and the sea-going powers of
                           '
the British Navy.
   Another distinguished mathematician whom we have within the
last few weeks had the misfortune to lose, was the Rev. Richard
Townsend, Professor of N utural Philosophy in the University of
Dublin, whose labours in the more abstruse <U+FB01>elds of geometrical
speculation extended over a period of nearly forty years. Mr. James
Rennie was also a votary of mathematical research.
   Among practical men of science, the veteran Mr. Charles Manby,
who for forty-<U+FB01>ve years had been Secretary or Honorary Secretary of
the Institution of Civil Engineers, will deservedly take a high place.
   The anatomical and physiological labours of Professor Allen Thom
son had extendcd over the longer term of <U+FB01>fty-four years, and few
possessed the power of clearer exposition than he, while for acts of
personal kindness there must be many besides myself who owe him a
deep'debt of gratitude.
   Among others connected with the medical profession we miss the
distinguished surgeon Mr. Caesar Hawkins, Dr. Alexander Tweedie,
and Sir Erasmus Wilson, whose name will long survive, not only in
connexion with dermatology and the Chair of' Pathological Anatomy
at Aberdeen, but with the Egyptian obelisk, known as Cleopatra’s
Needle, the presence of which in London is entirely due to his liberality.
    In Mr. R. A. C. Godwin-Austen we have lost one who for nearly
 <U+FB01>fty years had ranked among the foremost of English geologists.       His
 manifold observations will be recorded elsewhere, but as an instance
                        I
of his critical powers, may mention his now classical paper on the

possible extension of the Coal Measures beneath the south-eastern
part of England, read in 1855, his speculations in which as to the
western extension of the axis of Artois, all recent deep borings within
the Thames basin have so fully substantiated.
   In Dr. Wright we have lost an accomplished paleeontologist whose
knowledge of the fossil echinodermata and ammonitidee was almost
unrivalled.
   The Duke of Buccleuch had for <U+FB01>fty years been one of our Fellows,
and in 1867 occupied the position of President of the British Asso
ciation; while Sir Bartle Frere, although an ethnologist and geo
grapher, will probably be better known as an able and energetic
public servant and administrator than as a man of science.
   In common with the nation at large, we have to deplore the un
timely and unexpected decease of another distinguished statesman,
the late Postmaster-General, Mr. Fawcett.       A man of rare mental
powers, 'the effect upon him of the greatest of all physical depri
vations, the loss of sight, was only to make him rise superior to his
misfortune.    As a student of political economy he attained a high
reputation, and he turned his mastery of the subject to good account
when he entered into the sphere of public life, towards which his
natural aspirations led him.      His singleness and honesty of pur
pose, the inborn justice of his well-balanced mind, his devotion to
the public good, and his invariable courtesy, endeared him alike to
political friends and opponents; while to those who were brought
into more immediate contact with him, his truly sympathetic nature
and the marvellous memory, which preserved even minute details of
former conversations, gave a charm to his intercourse which none
who enjoyed it will ever forget.
       I
   As have already observed, our losses on the home list, including
one resignation of Fellowship and one removal from our list, are less
than in many former years, being altogether twenty-one in number;
we have, on the other hand, elected sixteen Fellows, including one
Privy Councillor.    It would, however, appear that our numbers are
gradually attaining to something like a state of equilibrium, and that
if our elections continue to be limited as at present, the roll of the
Society will remain at its present standard of about MO Fellows.
Looking at the recognised longevity of scienti<U+FB01>c men and the age
at which many now achieve the distinction of being elected into the
Society, it seems to me not improbable that our numbers will ere long
show a tendency to increase rather than to diminish.
   Of the “Philosophical Transactions,” three parts, and of the
“Proceedings,” eleven numbers, have been published; while the
number of papers received during the past year was 100, as com
pared with 103 in the previous year. Of these the most numerous
have been in the departments of electricity and magnetism, though

 physics and mathematics, chemistry, mineralogy,                anatomy and
 physiology,    botany, and  morphology    have  all had their  share.
     It is hardly within my province to select any papers that we have
  published as being the most worthy of mention.          The mere fact that
                              “                                ”
 they have appeared in the Philosophical Transactions            is a su<U+FB01>icient
 voucher for their value. I may, however, call attention to the report of
 Captain Abney and Dr. Schustcr, our Bakerian lecturer for the present
 year, on the total Solar Eclipse of May 17, 1882, which is the outcome
 of an expedition, towards which a grant of 3501. was made from our
 Donation Fund. Some of the results were mentioned by Mr. Spottis
 woode in his Presidential Address of 1882, but the value of the
 details with regard to the corona, and the success which attended the
 efforts of the photographers, can only be estimated from an examina
 tion of the paper itself.   The detailed results obtained by the photo
 graphers who accompanied the American expedition to Caroline
Island in the South Paci<U+FB01>c in order to observe the Solar Eclipse of the
5th of May, 1883, have not yet been brought before the Society.
    In respect to biological studies, our record of the past year, though
it does not contain the announcement of any very startling results,
gives evidence of fruitful activity along various lines of research.
    In Botany, Mr. Gardiner has continued his observations on the
important subject of the continuity of protoplasm in vegetable cells,
which was referred to in the President’s Address of last year; he has
also brought forward some interesting results derived from an exami
nation of the changes in the gland-cells of Dionsea, which serve still
further to illustrate the identity of the fundamental physiological
processes in plants and animals.          Mr. Bower has dealt with the
morphology of the leaf in certain plants, in a memoir both valuable in
itself, and noteworthy because hitherto the study of abstract vege.
table morphology has perhaps not obtained in this country the
attention which it deserves, and which has been given to it in other
countries, especially in Germany.
    In Physiology two important papers have been presented on the
difficult subject of the functions of the cerebral convolutions, one by
Drs. Ferrier and Yeo, and the other by Professor Schafer and Mr.
Horsley. Both contain observations which demand careful considera~
tion by all physiologists.
    The results of the study of animal forms which is happily being
carried on with great activity,     I  may say, all over the United King
dom, are for various reasons principally recorded elsewhere than in
                                      ”

Nevertheless, this subject has also been fairly represented at our
meetings.     Our distinguished and unwearied Fellow, Professor W.
Kitchen Parker, is still continuing his elaborate and valuable researches
on the vertebrate skull, and during the past session the
                                                                  Society has

had the pleasure of receiving several short papers, expounded in
person by their author, from a veteran in the study of animal mor
phology, whose <U+FB01>rst communication to the Society bears the date of
1832.   I need hardly say I mean Sir Richard Owen.
   A few words must be said with regard to the acquisitions made by
our library and collections.    Our gallery of portraits has, through the
kind liberality of Dr. Wilson, of Florence, received two important
additions in the form of half-length original portraits of the distin
guished mathematicians and philosophers, Leibnitz and Viviani, both
of whom were Foreign Members of this Society. When we remember
the warmth of feeling with which the rival claims of Newton and
Leibnitz to the invention of Fluxions or the Differential Calculus
were for many years discussed, and call to mind that the question
occupied the attention of a Committee of this Society in 1712, which
reported in favour of Newton’s claims, we may rejoice that the heat
of the controversy is long since over, and congratulate ourselves that
the portraits of these rival intellectual giants now hang peacefully side
 by side on our Walls. The portrait of Viviani, the great geometrician,
the pupil of Galileo and the associate of Torricelli, anda contemporary
of Newton and Leibnitz, <U+FB01>nds also a <U+FB01>tting resting-place in our gallery.
   Our portfolio of engraved and lithographic portraits of scienti<U+FB01>c
men has been considerably augmented by liberal donations from the
executors of our former President, the late Sir Edward Sabine,
through Mr. R. H. Scott.
   The    Lalande    medal, which    had  been  awarded    by the French
Academy to      Sir Edward in    1826, and which, together   with a Royal
Gold Medal, was presented to the Scienti<U+FB01>c Relief Fund, was by
the Council redeemed from the Fund, and will be preserved among
our other medals as a memorial of one who for so long a period
rendered important services to the Society.        A bronze medal of our
distinguished Fellow, Professor Sylvester, has been presented to our
collection by the Johns Hopkins University, at Baltimore.
   The library itself has during the past year received by donations
about 380 complete volumes, besides about 240 pamphlets, and more
than 2&00 parts of serials; 24: charts have also been presented to it.
   With regard to our <U+FB01>nances,         I may venture to say, as your
Treasurer, that    I consider them to be in a satisfactory condition.
   I must now turn to some of the subjects which, during the past
year, have occupied the attention of the President and Council, and
which in more than one instance have brought them into communi
cation with Her Majesty’s Government.
   In July of last year a letter from the Treasury was received
requesting our opinion as to the desirability of subsidising the Armagh
Observatory, the income of which had been materially reduced,
owing to recent legislation in Ireland.      In reply to this an answer

434                      Anniversary Meeting.                   [Dec  1,
was    sent pointing out the good work that had been done in the
Observatory, and the exceptional character of the institution, and
recommending it to the favourable consideration of the Government.
Unfortunately, however, the loss of income applicable to the mainte
nance of an observatory has not been made good, though the Treasury,
“having regard to the advice of the Royal Society, and to the diminu
tion in the income of the Observatory,” has granted a sum of 2,0001.
in aid of its funds, the annual income derived from which sum is to
be applied by trustees to the maintenance and purchase of instruments
and apparatus.
   Another correspondence with the Treasury as to the bathymetrical
survey of the lakes within the British Isles did not lead to any con
cession in favour of such a necessary complement to the National
Ordnance Survey, though the omission in our maps of all details
relating to the depth of our lakes and the contour of their beds,
cannot be justi<U+FB01>ed on practical, and much less on scienti<U+FB01>c grounds.
   In May last the Astronomer Royal brought under our notice the posi
tion of this country with respect to the International Bureau des Poids
et Mesures, an institution established by what is commonly known as
the Metric Convention ; and it was resolved that in the opinion of the
President and Council it is highly desirable that our country should
take part in the International Commission of Weights and Measures,
and contribute the sum which our adhesion would entail.       A deputa
tion was appointed to bring the subject under the notice of the Lords
of the Treasury, and after some correspondence, the Society was
authorised to enter into informal negotiations with the officers of the
 Bureau, with the happy result that Great Britain was invited to join
 the Metric Convention, and through her Ambassador at Paris has, I
 believe, now given in her adhesion to it, and is entitled to all the
 privileges accorded by the Bureau.    The appliances at the command
 of the Bureau for the veri<U+FB01>cation not only of the standards of the
 metric system, but of other units of measure, far surpass in scienti<U+FB01>c
 accuracy anything that is at present available in this country, and we
 now enjoy the double advantage of being removed from the state of
 isolation in which for some years we have stood in regard to the
 other nations of Europe, and of now being af<U+FB01>liated to an establish
 ment in which the veri<U+FB01>cation of standards has been carried to the
 highest perfection.   At the same time it is distinctly understood that
 our adhesion to the Bureau in no way commits the Government of
 this country to any change of opinion favourable to the adop
 tion of the metric system, but that our entire freedom to retain our
 own system of weights and measures is absolutely preserved.      What
 ever may be the advantages of the metric system from a scienti<U+FB01>c
  point of view, the question whether a scale of weights, money, and
 measures, which in its lowest denominations follows a duodecimal

rather than a decimal system, is not better adapted for the convenience
of daily life, is one that by many is regarded as fairly open to discussion.
    Another event of both scienti<U+FB01>c and national importance has been
 the meeting of an International Conference on the subject of a
Prime Meridian of Longitude.                 The desirability of a common
startipg-point from which to reckon degrees of longitude has long
been felt among all civilised nations, especially those of a maritime
character, and was discussed at some length during the Congress of
the International Geodetic Association at Rome in October, 1883.                   It
was not, however, until the end of last year that invitations were
issued by the United States Government for different countries to
send representatives to an International Conference to be held in the
city of Washington, for the purpose of discussing and, if possible, <U+FB01>xing
upon a meridian proper to be employed as a common zero of longi
tude and standard of time-reckoning               throughout the globe. The
letter of invitation addressed to this country was referred to the
President and Council of this Society with a request to advise the
 Government whether it was desirable in the interests of science to
accept the invitation.        In reply an opinion was expressed as to the
high importance both for the interests of science in general, and of
our own country in particular, that our Government should be repre
 sented at the Conference, and the Treasury at once sanctioned the
expense of sending two delegates to Washington.                 These were Sir
Frederick Evans, the late Hydrographer t0 the Admiralty, and
Professor J. C. Adams.           General Strachey, the Chairman of the
Meteorological Committee, was also nominated to represent India, and
Mr. Fleming to represent the Dominion of Canada. The delegates
assembled at Washington in the month of October last, and proceeded
to discuss the questions whether a single prime meridian for all
countries could be adopted, and if so, through what point on the
earth’s surface should that meridian be drawn.            After long discussion
it was eventually resolved that the meridian of Greenwich should be
generally adopted, twenty-two* of the nations voting in favour of
this measure, and only one, San Domingo, against it. The repre
sentatives of France and Brazil abstained from voting. The proposal
for the adoption of Greenwich was made by one of the representatives
of the United States of America, and was fully discussed.                  Our own
representatives ably supported the proposal, and            another   of  our  most
distinguished Fellows, Sir William Thomson, who happened to be in
America at the time, was courteously invited to attend the meetings
of the Conference, and on the request of the President to express
   “‘ The following nations voted in favour of Greenwich :—Austria, Chili, Colombia,
 Costa  Rica, Great Britain, Guatemala, Hawaii, Italy, Japan, Liberia, Mexico,
Netherlands,   Paraguay, Russia, Salvador, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey,
United States, and Venezuela.

436                      Anniversary Meeting.                        [Dec. 1,
his opinions.   The arguments adduced in favour of the adoption of
Greenwich were such as must commend themselves to all unpreju
diced minds. It could hardly be expected that there should be any
special spot upon the earth’s surface from which longitude would
naturally be reckoned, and the whole question, apart from any
sentimental or patriotic feelings, is therefore one of the greatest con
venience. Were the employment of degrees of longitude as general
geographical units entirely unheard of up to the present time, it
would, of course, be a matter of perfect indifference Whether the
datum was at Greenwich, Paris, the Ferroe Isles, or any other
spot. The meridians most in use are those of the two former
places, and when we come to consider that, as was pointed out,
the shipping tonnage controlled by the Greenwich standard of
longitude is about 14- million tons, while that controlled by the
longitude of Paris amounts to 1% million tons only, the prepon
derance of convenience in favour of the former is placed beyond all
dispute. The use of nautical charts constructed from the meridian of
Greenwich, and also of the Greenwich Nautical Almanack, is by no
means con<U+FB01>ned to the British Navy, for numerous other nations have
availed themselves of the long-extended labours of our hydrographers,
and the computations of our astronomers. At the same time there is
no one among us who would for a moment venture to dispute the vast
services to science which have been rendered by French astronomers
and geographers, nor should we contest the right of French savants
to regard Paris as the flemi/thltes- éa-n'a of all other branches of science ;
the question of a common zero of longitude, however, is not only of
scienti<U+FB01>c but of commercial importance, and we may be con<U+FB01>dent that
eventually our friends on the other side of the Channel, whose metric
system has been so largely adopted by other countries, will in their
turn sacri<U+FB01>ce their own meridian, and adopt that which all neigh
bouring countries have declared to be the most convenient for general
use.   If some French locality on the meridian of Greenwich, such for
instance as Argentan, were nominally the French datum, the results
would be the same so far as maps and charts are concerned, and
the natural patriotism of the French nation would remain uninjured.
    The adoption of an universal day has also been recommended by
 the Conference.    It is to be a mean solar day to begin for all the
 world at the   moment    of mean midnight of the initial meridian,
 coinciding with the beginning of the civil day and date of that
 meridian, and is to be counted from zero up to twenty-four hours.
    The great volcanic eruption of Krakatoa, in the Straits of Sunda,
 which took place in August of last year, was followed by remarkable
 atmospheric and other disturbances, observations on which have been
 communicated to this and various other learned Societies, and have
 led to much interesting discussion.          The fact, as pointed out by

 1884.]                    Treasurer’s  Adams.                         437
 General Strachey and Mr. Scott, that at some barometrical stations
 the atmospheric wave caused by the eruption was still to be traced
 until about 122 hours after its origin, and that it must have travelled
 more than three times round the entire circuit of the earth, shows
 how vast must have been the initial disturbance causing the wave.
 The possibility of the remarkable atmospheric appearances which so
 constantly accompanied the rising and setting of the sun for some
 months subsequent to the eruption, being due to volcanic dust in sus
 pension in the air, offered a farther incentive to investigate the whole
 history of the eruption.    In consequence the Council in January last
 nominated a Committee to collect the            accounts of the volcanic
                                         various
 eruption at Krakatoa and attendant phenomena, in such form as shall
 best provide for their preservation and promote their usefulness, and
a sum of 1001. in all has been granted from the Donation Fund to
 defray the expenses of the Committee. A Committee of the Royal
Meteorological Society, which had already been appointed to study
the sunset phenomena of 1883—84, joined forces with our Committee,
and their united labours, with Mr. A. Ramsay as secretary, have
resulted in the accumulation of a voluminous mass of material.        The
accounts given in the chief British and foreign scienti<U+FB01>c serials have
been extracted and classi<U+FB01>ed, and the times of the various observa
tions reduced to Greenwich mean time.
   The literature on the subject, as Mr. Symons informs me, seems
almost inexhaustible, and the Committee, feeling that some limit must
be adopted, have now stopped the collection of further data, and are
engaged in the discussion of what have already been obtained. The
MS. is classi<U+FB01>ed according to subjects, and each of these is being
studied by the members of the Committee most familiar with it. It is
to be hoped that in the ensuing session we shall be favoured with
some of the results of their labours.
   In the Presidential Address of last year mention was made of a
series of borings which it was proposed to make across the delta of the
Nile in Egypt, and which, with the sanction of the Secretary of State
for I’Var, had been entrusted to the of<U+FB01>cer commanding the Royal
Engineers attached to the army of occupation in Egypt.      Shortly after
wards a Report from Colonel Heriot Maitland, RE, and Major R. H.
Williams, R.E., was received, giving an account of a boring at Kasr
el-Nil, near Cairo, which had been carried to a depth of 45 feet, and of
a second boring at Kafr Zaiyat, where a depth of 84 feet was attained.
In both cases great dif<U+FB01>culties had to be surmounted, but in neither
was the solid rock reached beneath the super<U+FB01>cial deposits.     A second
Report from the same of<U+FB01>cers, dated January 18th last, states that a third
boring had been executed at Tantah, this time by the sappers of the
Royal Engineers, and not by Arab workmen, though still with but
imperfect tools.   In this instance a depth of 73 feet was reached, but

again without <U+FB01>nding the solid rock. Samples of the materials obtained
at di<U+FB01>erent depths in these three borings have been forwarded to the
Society by the War Department, and Professor Judd has kindly under
taken their microscopic examination, and will shortly report the results
of his labours to the Committee in charge of the subject.
    \Vith regard to the continuance of the borings, which seem to
promise information of great value and interest, it is to be feared that
the attention of the military authorities will for some time to come be
attracted to more urgent business, though the Council of this Society
has expressed its willingness to grant from the Donation Fund a
further sum of 200l., with the view of obtaining better apparatus for
boring than that which has hitherto been employed.
    The publication of the results of the “Challenger” Expedition,
with which a Committee of this Society is to some extent concerned,
has made considerable progress during the past year.        Mr. Murray
informs me that 47 Reports, forming 13 large quarto volumes, with
6276 pages of letter-press, 1051 lithographic plates, many woodcuts,
charts, and other illustrations, have now been published.     Nine other
Reports are now being printed, and the eleventh Zoological volume and
the <U+FB01>rst Botanical volume will be issued during the present <U+FB01>nancial
year.                                                 .
    The work     connected   with the   remaining thirty-six memoirs is
 making satisfactory progress,    a  large instalment of the manuscript
being already prepared, and many of the plates either already printed
 off or drawn on the stone.
     There has been an unavoidable delay in the case of the two volumes
 containing the narrative of the cruise, and a general account of the
 scienti<U+FB01>c results of the Expedition, but it is expected that they will
 be issued within the next three months, and possibly before the end
 of the current year.
     It was estimated that the investigations connected with the collec
 tions and observations made during the Expedition would be completed
 and published in 1887, and Mr. Murray has every reason to believe
 that the work will be <U+FB01>nished within the estimated time.
     The tenth Zoological volume which has just been issued, contains
 important Reports on the Nudibranchiata, Myzostomida, and Cirripedia,
 by Drs. Rudolph Berg, L. von Graff, and P. P. C. Stock, as well as on
 the Cheilostomata, a sub-order of the Polyzoa, by Mr. George Busk.
 A <U+FB01>rst instalment of the Anthropological Report is also given by
 Professor William Turner, in a detailed examination of the human
 crania, upwards of 60 in number, brought home by the Expedition.
 The total number of crania, however, described and tabulated in the
 memoir is 143, the whole from aboriginal and as yet nncivilised
 people.    The previous Zoological volume is devoted to an exhaustive
  examination of the Foraminifera, by Mr. H. B. Brady.

    The subject of the International Polar Observations, which were
carried out during the twelve months ending with August, 1883, has
been touched on in recent Presidential Addresses, and in that for 1881
the general outline of the whole scheme was indicated. Now, however,
the programme then only sketched out has been more than ful<U+FB01>lled,
no less than 14 stations for observers, 12 for -the Northern and 2 for
the Southern Hemisphere, having been organised. Of all the expedi
tions, one only, that from Holland, failed to reach its destination,
Dickson Harbour, at the mouth of the Obi river, as it was beset by
ice in the Kara Sea, in the month of September, 1882. The ship
which carried the members of the expedition sank in the month of
July, 1883, but they all reached home in safety, having carried out
their observations as fully as lay in their power. One of the two
expeditions sent out by the Chief Signal Of<U+FB01>ce, Washington, was not
so fortunate.     The party under Lieutenant Greely, after spending
over two years at Lady Franklin Bay, Smith’s Sound, was eventually
rescued at Cape Sabine, in July last, but not before many of its
members had succumbed beneath the fearful hardships of their pro
tracted Arctic sojourn.
   The actual points of observation, going eastwards from Behring’s
Straits, and the States, which sent out the expedition, are tabulated

results, and   it may be hoped that these will appear before the end. of
1885..

  440                        A nniversary Meeting.                  [Dec   1,
      Of the serial publication, “Communications from the International
  Polar Commission," six parts, with an aggregate of 334 pages, have
  already appeared, and in it will be found all particulars of I the under
  taking.
     The regulations under which the Government Grant of 4,0001. is
  administered have during the past year been again under discussion,
 and have in some respects been slightly modi<U+FB01>ed.          It is, of course,
 needless    to repeat  that  this  grant, though nominally made to the
 Royal Society, in no way adds to its funds, while its administration rests
 with a Committee of from sixty or seventy members, many of whom
 are not of necessity Fellows of our Society.        As the grant is now
 made in    two  instalments,  it has  been arranged that the meetings of
 the Committee shall be held twice in each year, viz., in May and
 December, which it is hoped will amply meet the convenience of
 applicants for grants.
     In looking back upon the grants which have been made during the
 past year, I think that a tendency may be observed on the part of the
 Committee to devote considerable sums in aid of extensive researches
 rather than to fritter away the money at their disposal in a series of
 small grants. They have, for instance, allotted the sum of 5001.
 towards the exploration of Kilimandjaro and the adjoining mountains
 of Tropical Africa, and 2001. in aid of an expedition for the exploration
 of the mountain of Roraima in British Guiana. A grant of 2001. has
 also been made towards areport on the Flora of China; while 3001. has
 been allotted towards the extra accommodation and instruments for
 magnetic observations in the new Observatory of the Royal Cornwall
 Polytechnic Society. It will be remembered that, in his Address last
 year, the President called attention to the discovery by Dr. Huggins
 of a method of photographing the solar corona without an eclipse;
 and, for the purpose of making further experiments in this direction,
 and for carrying on other physical observations at some place of high
 elevation and of easy access, a grant of 2501. was placed at the dis
posal of a Committee. The place of observation selected by the Com
mittee was the Ri<U+FB02>e], near Zermatt, in Switzerland, which has an
elevation of 8500 feet, and possesses important advantages both of
access, and of hotel accommodation.          They appointed Mr. C. Ray
\Voods, who had had experience in photographing the corona during
the eclipse of 1882 in Egypt, and again in Caroline Island in 1883,
to take charge of the work under the instructions of Dr. Huggins and
Captain Abney.
   Mr. Woods arrived at the Rilfel in the beginning of July, when he
                                                        “
erected the necessary instruments under a tent of         Willesdenized ”
paper, and continued at work there until the 21st of September.
Unfortunately, the present year has been exceptionally unfavourable
for work on the corona, in consequence of an unusual want of trans

parency in the higher regions of the atmosphere. This probably may
be owing to the presence there of ice-crystals or of small particles of
matter of some kind, such as, personally,        I  am tempted to think,
might be due to the Krakatoa eruption.          Whatever the cause, the
sky as seen from the Eiffel was far from being so clear as it has been
during former years. Mr. Woods observed that the freer the lower
air was from cloud and mist, the more distinctly came out a great
aureola around the sun, which he found to have a diameter of about
44°, and to be of a. faint red near the outer boundary, and bluish
 white within, up to the sun’s limb.
   These unfavourable conditions of the atmosphere have made it
impossible for Dr. Huggins to obtain any photographs of the corona
in England. The great advantage at the Eiffel of being free from
the light scattered from the lower 8000 feet of air has enabled Mr.
Woods, notwithstanding the serious drawback of the persistent aureola,
to obtain about 150 photographs, of which more than half are suf<U+FB01>
ciently good to show the general form of the corona, and a smaller
number, the stronger details of that part of it which lies within from
8' to 12' of the sun’s limb.     It would be premature to express any
opinion as to the    information  which may eventually come out from
the Ri<U+FB02>e] plates. They are now being drawn preparatory to a full dis
cussion. In the meantime    I may congratulate the Society upon the con
<U+FB01>rmation of the hope expressed by our President at the last anniver
sary, “that a new and powerful method of investigation has been
placed in the hands of students of solar physics.”
    Another of the grants made by the Committee has also contributed
to important scienti<U+FB01>c results, as it has enabled Mr. Caldwell to make
some important observations on the early stages of the monotrerne
ovum, a brief account of which was communicated to the meeting of
the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Montreal.
 A fuller account of the observations, such as is necessary for the
 adequate appreciation of their importance and hearings, will,   I hope,
 he laid before the Society during the ensuing session,        when we
 shall also probably hear the result of similar investigations in like
 manner rendered possible by the existence of the Government Grant.
    Some slight aid has been rendered from the same source towards
 the reduction of observations carried on at the meteorological station
 on the summit of Ben Nevis.        This Observatory, situated on the
highest point within the United Kingdom, has through the past year
been under the charge of Mr. R. T. Osmond and two assistants.
During the summer months the buildings of the Observatory have
been enlarged by the addition of new observing-rooms and increased
accommodation for the observers and any scienti<U+FB01>c workers who may
 desire to carry on those physical researches for which the climate and
 position of Ben Nevis afford many facilities.

    The erection and equipment of the Observatory have cost more
 than 5,0001. ; and, in connexion with the observations carried on at the
 top of the mountain, others have been daily made near the sea-level
 at Fort William.        A <U+FB01>rst report on these conjoint high and low level
 observations, which began in 1881, has been prepared by Mr. Buchan.‘
 The monthly normals for atmospheric pressure and temperature have
 been approximately          determined for the Observatory.               Important
 results have also been obtained relating to the decrement of tem
 perature with height, for different months of the year and hours of
 the day, the diurnal variations of the wind’e velocity, the very large
increase in the rainfall on and near the summit, and the altogether
 unexpected hygrometric conditions of the air in their relation to the
 cyclones and anti-cyclones 0f north-western Europe.
    Another of the funds at our disposal, the Scienti<U+FB01>c Relief Fund,
 requires a few words of mention.                Its resources have been con
 siderably enriched during the past year by the legacy of 1,0001. from
 Sir William Siemens, and nearly 501. from the medals offered by the
executors of the late Sir E. Sabine; and the legacy of 1,0001. from the
 late Mr. Bentham will, it is hoped, ere long be received; but even with
 these muni<U+FB01>cent additions the income of the fund will amount to only
 2501. per annum, while last year the calls upon it amounted,              I regret to
 say,  to no less  than  4501.    The incalculable   value   of such  a  fund   to men
of science or     their  families   requiring temporary aid must be apparent
to all, and looking at the unfortunate necessity for its existence which
the calls upon it prove,        I venture to commend it to your support. It
will, perhaps, not be out of place here to say a few words with regard
to the administration of this fund, the existence of which dates from
1859, and is in a great degree due to the exertions of the late Mr.
 Gassiot.     The Council of the Royal Society takes charge of any sums
contributed to the fund and invests them, applying the interest in
grants for the relief of such scienti<U+FB01>c men or their families as may
from time to time require or deserve assistance.                 These grants are,
however, made only on the recommendation of a committee of seven
members who investigate the cases before them, and applications for
relief cannot be entertained except on the recommendation of the
President of one of the following chartered societies, the Astronomical,
Chemical, Geographical, Geological, Linnean, Royal, and Zoological
Societies.     Since January, 1861, when the <U+FB01>rst grant was made, the
total number of grants is eighty-eight, and the total sum distributed
4,3401.
  '
    Our Donation Fund has also proved of much service, and several of
the applications for comparatively small amounts, which were referred
by the Government Grant Committee for the consideration of the
Council of the Royal Society, were met by grants from this source.

This most valuable fund, the annual income of which is now about
4001., has, during the past year, rendered important aid to various
scienti<U+FB01>c objects.    From it considerable grants have been made
towards obtaining specimens of Hatteria and Apteryx; for expenses
incurred on account of the voyage and investigations of the surveying
      “ Triton; ” for collection of materials
ship                                             relating to the Krakatoa
eruption; towards the borings in the Delta of Egypt ; and, lastly, in
aid of the Marine Biological Association.
   The close connexion of the future of our <U+FB01>sheries with the advance
ment of certain branches of zoological science was commented upon
by our President in his last anniversary address, and       I have now to
record the foundation of two establishments devoted to marine
research. The <U+FB01>rst of these is the station established at Granton,
near Edinburgh, mainly through the energetic labours of Mr. John
Murray of the “Challenger” expedition. It consists of a <U+FB02>oating
laboratory where physical and biological investigations are carried on,
and it is provided with a steam yacht for taking observations at sea
and procuring specimen         for examination.      Chemical and other
laboratories are now being erected on the shore, close to the enclosed
piece of water where the <U+FB02>oating laboratory is moored.                Two
naturalists, a chemist and a      botanist, are permanently attached to
the station, and have an engineer, a <U+FB01>sherman, and three attendants
to assist them in conducting regular systematic observations. £2,500
have been spent on the equipment of the station, and it has at present
an income of 4001. a-year, independent of the grants which some of
the permanent staff have received from the Government Grant Com
mittee to aid them in their researches.      It is well that it should be
known that any scienti<U+FB01>c observer is at liberty to make use of the
station free of charge; indeed, during the past year <U+FB01>ve gentlemen
and one lady have availed themselves of this privilege during short
periods of time.
   But the movement in favour of such stations has not been con<U+FB01>ned
                  I
to Scotland, for have also to chronicle the foundation of the Marine
Biological Association, which originated in a meeting held in these
rooms on March 31st last, our President being in the chair, and many
of our principal naturalists taking part in the proceedings. The
formation of such an Association has long been hoped for by many
interested in obtaining a correct knowledge of the life and conditions
of our sea-coast, who are now principally indebted to Professor Ray
Lankester for the realisation of their hopes. The operations of the
Association will in no way clash with those of the station at Granton,
but both institutions will work towards a common end. One effect,
indeed, of the new Association will probably be to render all the more
fruitful the labours on the more northern shores by instituting similar
researches at other parts of the coast of our island.                     ‘

     The work of the Association is as yet in the inceptive stage, but a
 site well adapted for a marine observatory will, through the liberal
 endeavours of the Mayor and Corporation of Plymouth, probably be
 secured in that town; some citizens of which have also promised a
 noble donation of 1,0001. towards its erection.         The Clothworkers’
 Company has contributed 5001., and the Mercers’ Company 250 guineas,
 while the Council of this Society has also shown its sympathy ‘with
 the movement by a grant of 2501., and the British Association by one
 of 1501.     Handsome donations have also been made by private indi
 viduals, and the number of members of the Association is gradually
 increasing.     When once the station is completed and at work, and its
 aims and operations become better known, I make little doubt that it
 will receive a much larger share of public support. But before the
 station can be erected and in work, it is calculated that an outlay of
 10,000]. is necessary for its building and equipment, of which as yet
 not quite half is forthcoming, and     I venture to take this opportunity
 of enforcing     the claims   of the Association upon all who are inte
  rested in “improving natural knowledge.”          As has already been well
 pointed out in the memorandum issued by the Association, “great
  “ scienti<U+FB01>c and practical results have been obtained in other countries,
  “
     notably in the United States of America, in Germany, France, and
  “ Italy,
            by studies carried on through such laboratories as the Marine
  “ Biological Association
                              proposes to erect in this country,” and   I may
  add as that already at work at Granton.           When we consider the
  enormous importance of our <U+FB01>sheries, and how large may be the
  amount of material bene<U+FB01>t derived from a scienti<U+FB01>c investigation of
  the causes of their increase and diminution, it will,   I think, be evident
  that the work to be carried on at these stations is not only for such a
  purpose as the development of abstract biological science, important
  as that may be, but for the advancement of our national resources.        It
  is, therefore, to be hoped that in addition to the private support which
  they will receive, they may in some manner be recognised by the
  nation at large as centres for carrying out systematic investigations
  into the circumstances determining marine life, from which a portion
  of our food supply is drawn, and a much larger portion might probably
  be derived.     The importance of our sea <U+FB01>sheries, which it will be one
  of the principal objects of the Association to promote, has of late
_ years
          been more fully recognised, and the recent International
  Fisheries Exhibition has done much to popularise the subject; while
  the of<U+FB01>cial appointment of our President also proves that in the
  opinion of our Government the scienti<U+FB01>c aspects of our <U+FB01>sheries are
                                                             '
  not to be neglected.

   desirability of carrying out, on the part of this country, investi
  gations into the nature of cholera in continuation and extension of

  those so zealously and bravely initiated by the distinguished German
 inquirer     Koch.     Although the Society has had no very direct
 in<U+FB02>uence in the matter, the Fellows will,      I venture to think, regard
 it as a subject for congratulation that the wish then expressed from
 this chair has been ful<U+FB01>lled, and that the distinguished expert in such
 questions—our Fellow, Dr. Klein—is at present engaged in India in
 the investigation of cholera at the instance of the Indian Govern
 ment.     It is sad to think how much nearer our own shores such
 investigations might have been conducted; may it be long ere they
 can be instituted on this side of the Channel.
    These remarks have already extended to such a length that can    I
 now only brie<U+FB02>y refer to a few of the events of scienti<U+FB01>c interest
 which have during the past year Occupied the attention of the Society
 or of a large number of its Fellows.      In the mouth of April last the
 University of Edinburgh celebrated its tercentenary with great pomp
 and no less hospitality, upwards of 120 delegates from various
 universities and other learned bodies being invited as guests. On
this occasion Lord Rayleigh kindly consented to be our representative,
 and was among those on whom the University conferred the honorary
 degree of LL.D.       The same distinguished Fellow occupied the Presi
 dential   chair  at  the   meeting of the British Association for the
 Advancement of Science at Montreal, on which occasion many of our
body took the opportunity of crossing the Atlantic.         Owing to the
muni<U+FB01>cent liberality and ungrudging hospitality of our brethren in
the Dominion of Canada, the somewhat bold experiment of holding a
meeting of the Association beyond the limits of the British Isles has
proved a great success, though, perhaps, it is an experiment which
would require exceptional conditions to be successfully repeated.
    The Society was represented by delegates at the meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science at Philadelphia
in September last.         The Electrical Exhibition at the same place
resulted in the    formation   of a Memorial Library in connexion with
the Franklin Institute, to which separate copies of the Papers
relating to Electricity that have appeared in the “Philosophical
Transactions” have been granted by the Council.             An Electrical
Congress at Paris, and an Ornithological one at         Vienna  have also
been among the events of the year.
    Subscribers to the Darwin Memorial Fund will be pleased to hear
that a<U+FB01>ne block of marble has been secured for the statue to be erected
in the Natural History Museum at South Kensington, and          I am glad
to learn from Mr. Boehm that his work will probably be completed
by the end of this year. When the total cost of the statue has been
ascertained, it will be necessary to hold a meeting of the Committee
in charge of the Memorial Fund to determine the manner in which
the balance is to be applied.

    It now only remains for me to thank the Fellows and others con
versant with the subjects on which       I have touched,.for information
kindly a<U+FB01>orded me; to thank you for the attention with which you
have listened to me, and to express a hope that it may not again for
many years occur that the Anniversary Address from this Presidential
chair shall have to be delivered by deputy.
    The Vice-President in the Chair then proceeded to the presentation
of   the medals.
    The Copley Medal has been awarded to Professor Carl Ludwig, of
 Leipzig, for his investigations in Physiology, and the great services
 which he has rendered to Physiological        Science.   During the last
 forty years,    the  advances   that  have   been   made   both in the
 powers of the microscope and in the methods of exact physical and
 chemical observation have reacted in a remarkable manner on the
 development of physiological knowledge, and during nearly the whole
,of that long period the name of Carl Ludwig has been prominent
 on the list of investigators, and to the progress that marks that
period he has probably contributed more than any man living. The
 determination of the exact share in this progress really due to himself
 alone is perhaps somewhat obscured by the generous way in which he
 has always placed his ideas and his knowledge at the service of those who
 have assisted in his laboratory, but there can be no doubt that a large
 proportion of our present knowledge of the phenomena of blood
 pressure and of the vaso-motor system, of the physiology of the
 'heart, and of the spinal cord, and of digestion and nutrition, is due
 to him and to his numerous pupils.
     Moreover, the very fact that he has allowed so many others to
 share in his experience      and to become trained in his methods,
  would in itself entitle him to some mark of our gratitude and
  esteem.
     A Royal   Medal has been awarded to Professor George H. Darwin
  for his mathematical investigations on the eifects of an imperfect
  rigidity of the earth, and on tides. The principal results of these
                                                   “
  researches have already been published in the      Philosophical Trans
  actions,” and are in the hands of the Fellows, who will no doubt
  rejoice to see the son of so distinguished a father still doing honour
  to the name of Darwin.
     A Royal Medal has been awarded to Professor Daniel Oliver for
  his investigations in the classi<U+FB01>cation of plants, and the services
  which he has rendered to taxonomic Botany. These services have been
  of the highest order; but apart from his numerous published papers,
  and his work on the Flora of Tropical Africa, his fertile labours in
  the Kew Herbarium would alone entitle him to recognition at the

1884.]                     Treasurer's Address.                     447
hands of this Society. When it is borne in mind that the labours of
Sir Joseph Hooker and the late Mr. Bentham, upon the great work
the “ Genera Plantarum,” now so happily completed, have been
materially lightened by the skilful aid of Professor Oliver, there
      I
will, am sure, be a general feeling of satisfaction that this year his
name should also be added to the list of the recipients of the Royal
Medals, on which the distinguished names of the more immediate
authors of the work are already enrolled.
    The Rumford Medal has been awarded to Professor Tobias Robert
Thalén, of Upsala, for his spectroscopic researches; his labours in
other <U+FB01>elds of research, such as elasticity, magnetism, and meteorology,
lying outside the limits contemplated by the founder of this medal.
Partly in conjunction with Angstriim and partly by himself Professor
Thalén has produced accurate and elaborate maps, drawn according
to the natural scale of wave-lengths, of the spectra of a great number
of metals and metalloids.     He has also made a careful determination
of the absorption-bands of iodine vapour, and of late has been engaged
on the difficult problem of determining and properly assigning the
spectral lines of bodies of the yttrium and cerium groups, the number
of which has recently been so largely augmented by discoveries of
new members of those groups, which as yet are only imperfectly
 studied.
    The Davy Medal has been awarded to Professor Hermann Kolbe of
 Leipzig for his researches in the isomerism of alcohols; but sad to say,
 though he was aware of the award, he has not lived to receive the
 medal. While still occupied in his usual avocations, he died suddenly
 on descending from his carriage at his own door less than a week ago.
 During a period of upwards of forty years Professor Kolbe devoted
 his principal attention to some of the most dif<U+FB01>cult and complicated
 questions of organic chemistry, many of the important reactions in
 which have been discovered through his researches.      One remarkable
 result of his study has been that he was able to predict the existence
 of the chief groups of isomeric alcohols, and even to describe before
 hand their characteristic reactions. In one case, at least, his pro-I
 phecy may, in a certain sense, be said to have ful<U+FB01>lled itself, for it
 has been by his own experimental evidence that its truth has been
 con<U+FB01>rmed.     It may be some slight consolation to his family to think:
 on seeing this medal how highly Professor Kolbe’s labours were
 appreciated, even beyond the limits of his own country.

  then read, and Dr. George Harley and Mr. R. H. Inglis Palgrave

       Report of the Kew Committee           for  the  Year ending
                            October 31, 1884.
    The operations of The Kew Observatory, in the Old Deer Park.
 Richmond, Surrey, are controlled by the Kew Committee, which is
 constituted as follows :
                     Mr. Warren De La Rue, Chairman.
    Captain  W.    de  W. Abney,         Vice-Adm. Sir G.    H. Richards,
      R.E.                                  C.B.
   Prof. W. G. Adams.                    The Earl of Rosse.
   Capt. Sir F. Evans, K.C.B.            Mr. R. H. Scott.
   Prof. G. C. Foster.                   Lieut.-General W. J. Smythe.
   Mr. F. Galton.                        Lieut.-Gen. R. Strachey, C.S.I.
                               Mr. E. Walker.
   The work     at the Observatory    may be considered under the fol
lowing heads :—
   lst. Magnetic observations.
   2nd. Meteorological observations.
   3rd. Solar observations.
   4th. Experimental, in connexion with any of the above          depart,
           ments.
   5th. Veri<U+FB01>cation of instruments.
   6th. Rating of “latches.
   7th. Miscellaneous.
                        1. MAGNETIC   OBSERVATIONS.
   The Magnetographs       have worked uninterruptedly    throughout  the
year.
   The curves have been quite free from any large <U+FB02>uctuations, and
indeed   no unusual disturbance has been registered for a long time
past.   The  most notable perturbations recorded took place on July 3.
September 18, and October 2, but the extreme oscillation of the Decli
nation Magnet on any of these days did not exceed 30', while the
change of Horizontal Force was less than 0'02 Gaussian unit.

                      Report of     the    Kew  Committee.                  463
     The values of the ordinates of the di<U+FB01>erent           photographic   curves
 determined in January were as follows :—
             Declination:   1 inch=O° 2204.          1 mm.=0° 0"87.
     Bi<U+FB01>lar, January  4, 1884,  for    1  inch 6H=O'0276 foot grain   unit.
                                 ,,    1  mm. ,, =O'OOO5 mm. mgr.     unit.
     Balance, January 4, 1884    ,,    1  inch 6V=0‘0251 foot grain   unit.
                                 ,,    1  mm. ,, =O'OOO5 mm. mgr.     unit.
     The distance between the dots of light upon the cylinders of both
  the Bi<U+FB01>lar and Vertical Force Magnetometers having become too
 small for satisfactory registration, it was found necessary to readjust
 each instrument, after which the scale values were again determined
  on January 11th, with the following results :—
     The monthly observations with the absolute instruments have been
  made as usual, and the results are given in the tables forming
  Appendix   I of this Report.
              Bi<U+FB01>lar for  1 inch 5H=O'0267 foot grain unit.
                       ,, 1 mm.      ,, =O‘0005 mm. mgr. unit.
              Balance  ,, 1 inch    8V=O'0296     foot grain unit.
                       ,, 1 mm. ,, =O‘OOO5 mm. mgr. unit.
     The tabulation referred to in last year’s Report of the traces of the
 three magnetic elements for the International Polar Commission, is
 now completed, and the conversion of the results into absolute units
 is in an advanced stage.
    The dif<U+FB01>culty experienced in adapting ordinary unprotected gas
burners to the Bi<U+FB01>lar and Balance Magnetometers, owing to the
extremely sensitive nature of the gelatino-bromide paper, has now
been overcome by the use of a small screen of blue glass interposed
between the flame and mirror.            This diminishes the intensity of the
light, so that the traces are now well de<U+FB01>ned instead of being blurred.
    Information on matters relating to terrestrial magnetism, and
various data, have been supplied to Dr. Wild, General Tillo, Dr,
Frolich, Admiral Sir G. Richards, and Dr. Balfour Stewart.
    The various magnetic instruments returned by Captain Dawson,
R.A., on his arrival in this country from the Fort Rae Circumpolar
Expedition, were lent, with the exception of the Balance Magneto
meter, one Bi<U+FB01>lar, and one Declinometer, to Lieutenant A. Gordon,
R.N., of the Meteorological Of<U+FB01>ce, Canada.
    Professors Riicker and Thorpe visited the Observatory on July 17,
18, and 19, for the purpose of taking a series of absolute magnetic
observations preparatory to surveying the western coast of Scotland,
as a. preliminary operation towards the proposed repetition of the
Survey of Great Britain and Ireland mentioned in last Report.

464                     Report of    the Kew Committee.
   The following is a summary of the number of magnetic observations
made during the year       :—
        Determinations of Horizontal Intensity . .       ......        35

   Soon after the needles of Dip Circle Barrow 33 had been repolished,
as mentioned    in last Report, it was found that No. 1 worked somewhat
indifferently, and on examining its axle slight marks of scoring were
discovered.     It was therefore deemed advisable to have a new axle
substituted.     This was accordingly done by Mr“ Dover, in December
last, and since then the performance of the needle has been satis
factory.
                     II.   METEOROLOGICAL     OBSERVATIONS.
   The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registra
tion respectively of atmospheric pressure, temperature, and humidity,
wind (direction and velocity), bright sunshine, and rain, have been
maintained in regular operation throughout the year.
   The standard eye observations for the control of the automatic
records have been duly registered during the year, together with the
daily observations at O h. 8 m. P.M. in connexion with the US. Signal
 Service synchronous system.           A summary of these observations is
given in Appendix II.                                                 ~
   The tabulation of the meteorological traces has been regularly
 carried on, and copies of these, as well as of the eye observations,
 with notes of weather, cloud, and sunshine have been transmitted
 weekly to the Meteorological Of<U+FB01>ce.

    In compliance with        a  request made by the Meteorological        Council

                      Report  of the Kew  Committee.                  465
to the Committee, the Meteorological instruments at the Observatories
of Armagh, Falmouth, Oxford (Radcliffe), and Valencia have been
inspected by Mr. Whipple, and those at Aberdeen and Stonyhurst by
Mr. Baker, during their respective vacations.
    Assistance has also been given in arranging the plans, designs, &c.,
for the New Observatory, now in progress of erection at Falmouth.
    With the concurrence of the Meteorological Council, weekly abstracts
of the meteorological results have been regularly forwarded to, and
published by “The Times” and “The Torquay Directory.” Data
have also been supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological
                         “
Sooiety, the editor of      Symons’s Monthly Meteorological Magazine,”
the Secretary of the Institute of Mining Engineers, Messrs. Gwilliam,
Mawley, Rowland, and others.         The cost of these abstracts is borne
by the recipients.
    The weekly abstracts of meteorological results, which have been
                                                   ”
published by the “Illustrated London News            without interruption
since 1856, were discontinued in July last, at the request of the
proprietors, owing to changes being introduced in the form of publi
cation of the paper.
    Eleatrograph.—This     instrument was temporarily dismounted in
May,   whilst  some repairs and painting of the instrument room were in
progress, and recently some trouble has been experienced in keeping
the potential of the charge constant, otherwise it has been maintained
in continuous action.
 k
    The tabulation of the curves is at present in arrear, not having
been completed beyond February 28, 1882.
    Its scale value has been redetermined on two occasions by means
of the Portable Electrometer, White No. 53, such determinations
being necessary after every readjustment of the instrument.
                         III.  SOLAR OBSERVATIONS.
    The  sketches of Sun-spots, as seen projected on the photoheliograph
screen, have been made on 185 days, in order to continue Schwabe’s
enumeration, the results being given in Appendix II, Table IV.
    A few experiments were made in June with the Photoheliograph,
 with a view of testing the suitability of certain plates prepared by
 Messrs. Morgan and Kidd for solar photography.          With this excep
 tion nothing has been done in that branch during the year.
    Transit Observations—Frequent      observations of both solar and
sidereal transits have been made, for the purpose of keeping correct
local time at the Observatory.
    Numerous clock and chronometer comparisons have been also
 made.     The Observatory Chronometers, Parkinson and Frodsham
 No. 2408, and Molyneux No. 2125, have been cleaned and readjusted,

466                 Report of the Kew      Committee.
and the following clocks are kept carefully rated in addition as time
keepers of the Observatory :—French; Shelton K. O. ; Shelton No. 35 ;
and Dent 2011.      By the courtesy of Mr. Preece, Superintendent
of Tclegraphs, the Richmond Chief Post Of<U+FB01>ce was placed in direct
communication with the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, on January 22,
and enabled to receive the time signal at 10 A.M., when a period of
cloudy weather had rendered the true time a little uncertain.         Two
chronometers conveyed to the Post Of<U+FB01>ce, showed, on comparison with
the signal, a satisfactory agreement between the times as kept at the
two Observatories.
                       IV.  EXPERIMENTAL     WORK.
   Aetinometry.—A report on the Balfour Stewart actinometer observa
tions made last year, was submitted in December to the Meteorological
Council, at whose expense the observations were carried on, and it
was resolved to discontinue them.         The instrument has since been
re turned to Professor Balfour Stewart at his request.
   Fog Gauge—In conformity with a suggestion contained in an
article in “ Symons’s Meteorological Magazine,” vol. xviii, p. 58, a
painted board has been set up to the north of the Observatory, to serve
as a gauge for measuring the intensity of fogs.
   Since its erection in January last no fog, however, has been
observed of intensity 1 on its scale.
   Magnetic Survey of Great Britain and Ireland—With reference to
this, the Sub-Committee appointed last year has now under considera
tion the details necessary for the earl,yr prosecution of the survey.
   Professors Riicker and Thorpe have during the past summer made
preliminary observations at a number of stations along the West
Coast of Scotland, their base observations being made at the Obser
vatory as above stated.
   Nocturnal Radiation—Experiments have been made with a. new
pattern thermometer, designed by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra for
observations of nocturnal terrestrial radiation, with a view to the
avoidance of several serious defects in the Rutherford Minimum, now
generally used.     Very favourable results were obtained until the
instrument was damaged, and had to be sent back to the makers.          It
has not yet been returned to the Observatory.
    Photo-nephograph.—-Various experiments have been made with this
apparatus during the year, but in consequence of the short base line
obtainable with the small amount of connecting wire available for
working the pair of cameras, very few satisfactory determinations of
cloud altitudes have been made.
    A report having, however, been submitted to the Meteorological
Council, that body has granted a sum of 401. to the Committee

                     Report of  the Kew  Committee.                  467
for the purpose of purchasing a half-mile of double wire telegraphic
cable and reel, together with switches and keys, in order that the
two cameras may be worked at a distance of 800 yards apart.
   A stand has been erected on the roof of the Observatory, Where
camera A will be permanently placed, and camera B will be similarly
supported by another permanent stand at the other end of the cable.
Both cameras being oriented with reference to the same point of the
horizon, the distant observer will be instructed as to the direction and
elevation of his instrument by means of a telephone switched on to
the line for the purpose.
   Some di<U+FB02>iculties having been met with in working the electrical
instantaneous shutters, part of the apparatus was returned to the
makers, the Philosophical     Instrument Construction Society, Cam
bridge, and recti<U+FB01>ed.
   Experiments with the new arrangement are now being made, and
should they prove successful it is intended to bury the cable in the
ground across the park beside the Observatory gas main, thereby
obviating the present necessity of laying out and winding it in again
every time it is desirable to make cloud altitude and air-current
motion determinations.
   Solar Radiation Thermmeters.-—The experiments with a view to
determining the causes of variation in the readings of similarly con
structed and exposed black bulb thermometers, in vacuo, have been
continued during the year.
   The <U+FB01>rst series of observations having been concluded, and the
results communicated to the Royal Meteorological Society and pub
lished in their “Quarterly Journal,” vol. 2, p. 45, the six thermo
 meters were returned to Messrs. Negretti and Zambra, in order that
all might have their bulbs coated with three coats of lampblack and
their jackets altered: one pair is now enclosed in small bulbs, a
second pair in medium, and the third pair in large bulbs.
   With the exception of one which was accidentally broken in July,
they have been read daily since May 3. The results have not yet
been fully discussed, but a cursory inspection appears to indicate that
the larger the containing bulb the lower is the reading of the enclosed
                                                 '
blackened bulb thermometer.
    Ventilation Experim ents.—Assistance has been given to a Sub-Com
mittee of the Sanitary Institute in their experiments on the motion of
air in ventilating tubes, which have been carried on during the
summer under the charge of Mr. R. Rymer Jones, CE, in a hut
erected for the purpose, adjacent to the Observatory.
   The experiments are in continuation of those prosecuted in the
Experimental House in 1880.
   Wind Integrator.—At the request of Mr. Walter Baily, M.A., awind

468                   Report  of the Kew
                                           Committee.
vol. xvii, p. 482, has been erected in the Experimental House, being
attached by permission of the Meteorological Council to their spare
Beckley Anemograph.
   Some dif<U+FB01>culties were experienced on account of the unsuitability
of the electrical counters <U+FB01>tted -to it for registration of light winds,
but these have now been overcome,'
                                          and the instrument is working
satisfactorily.

   Besides these, 13 Deep-sea Thermometers have been tested, 41 of
which were subjected, in the hydraulic press, without injury, to
pressures exceeding two tons on the square inch.           142 Thermometers
have been compared at the freezing-point of mercury, making a total
of 10395 for the year.
   Duplicate copies of corrections have been supplied in 30 cases.
   The number of instruments rejected on account of excessive
error, or which from other causes did not record with suf<U+FB01>cient
apcuracy, was as follows :—

32 Barometers, 742 Thermometers, 14 Hydrometers and 10 Sextants.
                         VI.  RATING   or WATCHES.
   The arrangements for rating         watches   mentioned in last year’s
Report have been completed and brought into operation successfully,
at a cost of £193.
   A second safe having been purchased by the Committee, an appa
ratus was <U+FB01>tted to it which enables the enclosed watches to be
maintained continuously at either high temperatures, without being
subjected to injury by fumes of gas, or at low temperatures.

470                          Report       of   the  Kew Committee.
   Two additional Mean Time Clocks have been obtained, one of them,
a  Transit of Venus Expedition Clock, Dent 2011, has been lent to
the Committee by the Astronomer Royal; the other has been pur
chased.        Mr. T. Mercer, watch manufacturer, of Coventry, having
obligingly placed a number of watches at the disposal of the Super
intendent, two dozen were obtained on loan from him, and were
daily compared, tested, and rated by the assistants for three months.
This enabled them to become familiarized with the work of rating
before watches were received from the public.
   The Superintendent, after communicating with the Directors of
the Geneva and the Yale Observatories, prepared a circular specifying
the conditions watches must ful<U+FB01>l in order to obtain certi<U+FB01>cates of
the various classes, A, B, and C, which are issued, and the nature
of the test to which they will be subjected. This circular, together
with. the forms of certi<U+FB01>cates, &c., after revision and approval by the
Committee, was printed, and copies forwarded to all the leading
watch manufacturers of this country, as well as to the principal
journals, many of which very favourably noticed the scheme.
   Rating commenced on May 13, and up to the present 442 watches
have been tried, of which 22 were submitted by the owners, and 20
by the manufacturers, or by dealers.
   Certi<U+FB01>cates have been awarded to 17 of these watches, 7 are now
on trial.
   The following table will indicate the nature of the trials to which
the certi<U+FB01>cates refer :—

                                          APPENDIX           1.
    Magnetic     Observations      made at the Kew Observatory,          Lat.   51° 28' 6" N.
        Long.    0h 1‘“   1551   thor     the year October 1883 to September         1884.
       The observations of De<U+FB02>ection and Vibration given in the annexed
    Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked K C 1, and
    the Kew 9-inch Uni<U+FB01>lar Magnetometer by Jones.
       The Declination observations have also been made with the same
    Magnetometer, Collimator Magnets 101 B and N E being employed for
    the purpose.
       The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle Barrow No. 33, the
    needles 1 and 2 only being used; these are 315 inches in length.
       The results of the observations of De<U+FB02>ection and Vibration give the
    values of the Horizontal Force, which, being combined with the Dip
    observations, furnish the Vertical and Total Forces.
       These are expressed in both English and metrical scales—the unit in
    the <U+FB01>rst being one foot, one second of mean solar time, and one grain;
    and in the other one millimetre, one second of time, and one milli gramme,
    the factor for reducing the English to metric values being 046108.
       By request, the corresponding values in C.G.S. measure are also given.
       The value of log          sz
                               employed in the reduction is 164365 at tem
    perature 60°      F.

      The correction of the magnetic power for temperature                          to   to an
    adopted standard temperature of 35° F. is
                  0'0001194(t0—35) + 0'000,000,213(t(,—35)’.
      The true distances between the centres of the de<U+FB02>ecting and de<U+FB02>ected
    magnets, when the former     placed at the divisions of the de<U+FB02>ection
                                          is
    bar marked 1'0 foot and 1'3 feet, are 1'000075 feet and 1300097 feet
    respectively.
       The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from the
    mean of 12 or 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in
    making 100 vibrations, corrections being applied for the torsion-force
    of the suspension-thread subsequently.
       N0 corrections have been made for rate of chronometer or are of    1
    vibration, these being always very small.

   CHARLES WILLIAM    SIEMENS, whose untimely death on November 19,
1883, we have to record, was born at Lenthe,        in Hanover, on the
4th April, 1823.
   His education was begun at the Gymnasium of Liibeck, from which
he passed to the Polytechnic       School of Magdeburg, and <U+FB01>nished
at the University of Gettingen.       During his University course he
had the advantage of studying the natural sciences under Professors
Wiihler and C. Himly, from the latter of whom the Siemenses re
ceived the <U+FB01>rst impulse towards those investigations which led to
their <U+FB01>rst invention—the electro-gilding process.
   Leaving the University in 184-2, at the age of nineteen, William
Siemens entered upon the practical business of life by spending a
year as pupil in the engine works of Count Stolberg, thus adopting
the profession of engineer, in which in after years he attained such
commanding eminence.       It is interesting to observe that, at the very
outset of his career, he showed how wide and all-embracing was his
understanding of the word engineer, and of what an engineer should
be.    To his mind the word meant the practical development of' the
results of science, in order to minister to the wants and comforts
of mankind; and he considered that an engineer must be able, if not
himself an original investigator, at least to appreciate fully the con
quests of science in the realm of Nature, and from his knowledge of
ways and means to adapt the results so gained from time to time to
the needs of life. His career shows how completely William Siemens
realised this idea, and not only so, but establishes for him strong
claims to rank as an able worker in the domain of pure science.
    In 1843, when he was only twenty years old, William Siemens
came to England to realise a joint invention. of his own and his
brother Werner in electro-gilding;        and, persevering through the
complication of dif<U+FB01>culties naturally met with'by a young man in
a strange land, with little knowledge of its language, he succeeded in
proving the usefulness of the invention, and getting it carried into
practical eifect through the wise and kindly appreciation of Mr.
Elkington. Encouraged by this success, William Siemens returned
a year later with his chronometric governor—an invention of remark
 able beauty and ingenuity, in which, by the motion of a pivoted
framework carrying an idle wheel geared to bevel wheels on two
 shafts in line, or geared to the outer and inner circumferences of
concentric wheels, rotating in opposite directions on coaxial shafts,
 the movement of one wheel is caused to keep time with that of the
 other.    We believe that, although the invention was not a com
 mercial success, and is not generally known in this country as prac
 tically realised except in its application to regulate the motions of
                                                                  b

                                     11
 chronoscopic instruments in the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, it
 may yet be destined to have large practical applications in engi
 neering.
    The process of anastatic printing, which was also the joint inven
 tion of William and his brother Werner, belongs to this period.         As
 an evidence of the importance which was early accorded to this
 invention, it may be stated that it was considered worthy of being
 made the subject of a Friday evening lecture by Faraday at the
 Royal Institution in 1845.      Siemens himself, in a lecture delivered
 by him at Birmingham on 20th October, 1881, referring to this in
 vention, states that the favourable notice taken of it by Faraday
 “ obtained for me an
                        entry into scienti<U+FB01>c circles, and helped to sustain
 me in dif<U+FB01>culty.”
    Another of William Siemens’ early inventions was his water-meter,
 which exactly met an important practical requirement, and has had
 a splendid thirty years’ success. It applied curiously subtle hydraulic
 principles, which, even irrespectively of the practical value of the
instrument, are of great interest. Imagine a Barker’s mill running
absolutely unresisted. The discharged water must have approximately
 zero absolute velocity on leaving the nozzles; in other words, its
velocity relatively to the nozzles must be approximately equal to the
contrary absolute velocity of the nozzles.       Hence the machine will
rotate in simple proportion to the quantity of water passing through
it. By an extension of similar considerations, it is easy to prove that
if the wheel, instead of being unresisted, is resisted by a force exactly
proportional to the square of its angular velocity, its velocity must
still be proportional to the quantity of water passing through it per
unit of time. Thus, provided this law of resistance is maintained,
the whole angle turned through by the wheel measures the whole
quantity of water that has passed.        Now think of the dif<U+FB01>culties
which Siemens had to overcome to apply this principle.          What has
been roughly called 'a Barker‘s mill, must be completely inclosed in
the supply water-pipes, its nozzles discharging into water, not into
air. It must be of very small dimensions to be convenient for practice,
and its bearings must be kept oiled to secure, not only that it may not
be injured by the wear of running for years, but also that the con
stant frictional force of solid rubbing on solid may be as nothing
compared to the resistance, proportional to the square of the velocity,
exerted by the circumambient liquid upon a wheel with sharp edged
vanes rotating in it.     After a few years of trials, dif<U+FB01>culty after
dif<U+FB01>culty was overcome, and the instrument did its work with the
accuracy and convenience which met practical requirements.          It was
we believe the protection o<U+FB01>ered by the British Patent Law which,
in the case of this very instrument, allowed Siemens to work it out
in England, and so helped him eventually to <U+FB01>nd his home among us,

                                                    iii
               and to give us primarily the bene<U+FB01>t of his great inventiveness in all
               directions; while the want of similar protection under German law
               at that time rendered it  practically impossible for him to work out so
               dif<U+FB01>cult an invention in his own country.
                  In the foregoing we have selected those results of Siemens’ inven
               tive genius, not only on account of their position in time, or of the
               principles involved, but also, and perhaps mainly, because of the
               circumstances connected with them forming determining factors of
               such moment in his career.      There  ismuch in the lifework of such a
               man as Siemens, which while     it   might prove of great interest, and
               have some measure of importance in its bearing on his career as a
               whole, must yet of necessity be passed over in such a notice as this.
               We shall, therefore, here merely remark that during the ten years
 2-:2          from his arrival in this country till about 1856, Siemens was employed
 Eel:          on various engineering works.        He Was for some time engaged in

r
:1             the importance of the principle embodied in    it  was recognised by the
 tip!           Society of Arts, who in 1850 awarded to William Siemens a gold
               medal “for his regenerative condenser.” From papers contributed
i   [:1        by him to various societies about this time—for instance, “ On a New
 if:           Regenerative Condenser as applied to High and Low Pressure Steam
 util'         engines,” to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1851; “ On
               the Expansion of Isolated Steam, and the Total Heat of Steam,” to
               the Journal of the Franklin Institute in 1852; and a most important
                       “ On the
               paper             Conversion of Heat into Mechanical E<U+FB02>'ect,” to the
               Institute of Civil Engineers in 1853 (for which he obtained the
               Telford Medal)—we see how persistently he clung to the problem of
           .   the better utilisation of heat. It was, indeed, at that time a conviction
               <U+FB01>rmly <U+FB01>xed in his mind, that the various existing modes of using
               heat were wasteful and extravagant in the extreme, and he was con
               tinuously directing all his energies, not only to overcome the evil, but
               to convince others of its existence.       The problem had always a
               fascination for him, and to the very latest pressed its claims upon his
               mind.
                  The great movement for smoke abatement, which has arisen within
               recent years, had his deepest sympathy, and his earnest      labours on

                                    iv
its behalf during the last three years of his life may yet we hope have
full  e<U+FB01>'ect. Just as those other wasteful modes of using heat yielded,
as we shall see later, to Siemens’ inventive genius persistently applied,
so also, had he been spared to us, would this particular mode have
had to yield in time.
   Just nine days before his death, the writer of this notice had
received a letter from Sir William Siemens, saying nothing of illness,
but full of plans for the immediate future: chie<U+FB02>y an address to the
Society of Arts, and the realisation at Sherwood of his method for the
smokeless supply of heat to a steam-boiler, by the combustion of
hydrogen, carburetted hydrogen, and carbonic oxide, obtained from
the conversion into- these gases of the whole combustible material of
the coal, together with some hydrogen and oxygen from water, and
                                                  “ The
oxygen from air, in his gas-producing kiln.             producer will be
in full operation at Sherwood by that time,” were almost the last
words received by the writer from his friend, kindly inviting him to
come and see the new method in operation at the end of the current
month. A short time before, in travelling home from Vienna, where
they had been associated in the British Commission for the Electrical
Exhibition, Sir William Siemens. had told the writer that without
waiting for a perfected gas-engine to use the products of combustion
as direct motive agent, and so- give the very highest attainable
economy, he expected by using the gas from- his producer as fuel for
the <U+FB01>re of a steam-boiler, even on a comparatively small scale, like
that of his appliances at Sherwood for electric lighting and the
 electric transmission of power, to be able to obtain better economy of
 coal for motive power than by burning the coal directly in the usual
manner in a furnace under the boiler.. And further, what is especially
interesting to persons planningisolated installations for electric light,
that he (Siemens) believed that the labour of tending the producer
and boiler and steam-engine, would be on the whole considerably less
than that which is required on the ordinary plan, with its incessant
stoking of coal into the furnace under the boiler, as long as steam is
to be kept up. There is something inexpressibly sad, even in respect
to a comparatively small matter like this, to see the active prosecution
of an experiment so full of interest and so near to a practical solution
suddenly cut short by death.
   In 1857 William Siemens, in conjunction with his younger brother
and pupil, Frederick, commenced investigations with a view to using
the principle of “regeneration” in the process of metallurgy.        The
result of their labours, in which it may be observed the elder brother
had the greater share, was the regenerative gas furnace, certainly the
most valuable and important of the many products of their genius
which the Siemeuses have given to the world. It was <U+FB01>rst practically
applied, in 1861, within the works of the Messrs. Chance, of

                                      \
                                    v
Birmingham, to one of their glass-smelting furnaces, and proved a
complete and undoubted success.       As showing the saving to this
industry alone, it may be observed that glass-smelting furnaces upon
Siemens’ principle are now in operation in which the fuel consumed
is only 15 cwts. for every ton of glass produced, instead of. 2 or 3
tons of fuel as was formerly the usual consumption for each ton of
glass.
    The great economy of fuel effected by the regenerative gas furnace,
together with the great ease with which its high temperature could
be maintained and regulated, soon led to its application in the
production of iron and steel. In 1862 a paper by Siemens appeared
in the “Chemical News” “On the Regenerative Gas Furnace as
applied to Glass Furnaces, Puddling, Heating, &c.,” and from that
year the application of the regenerative principle to the processes of
iron and steel making gained increasing attention from those
concerned, having been very early adopted in the iron district of
Lanarkshire in Scotland.
    But Siemens did not rest content with the application of his
regenerative gas furnace to the then known methods of iron and
steel-making.     With this new appliance he now turned his attention
to the improvement of the methods of manufacture.               His <U+FB01>rst
attempt was in the production of steel on the open hearth according
to the well-known experiments of Reamur, and in 1862 a practical
 trial of the arrangements devised by him to e<U+FB01>cct this was made at
Tow Law by Mr. Charles Atwood, under a licence from William
 Siemens. This arrangement was found, however, to be faulty, and
 had to be laid aside.     After one or two other disappointments,
 Siemens took the matter into his own hands, and in the famous
sample steel works which he founded at Birmingham in 1865, he
wrought out to a thorough practical success the process of steel
making known as the Siemens Process, a subsequent improvement of
which is the now well-known Siemens-Martin Process. Within three
or four years after this the Landore Works, near Swansea, were
 organised on an extensive scale for the carrying out of this manu
 facture, William Siemens being here associated with Mr. Dill
wyn, M.P., as the principal owners. The new material—mild steel—
thus introduced, speedily proved its surpassing excellence for
metallic structures in which strength and lightness were desired:
 while its manipulation was less dif<U+FB01>cult than that of iron on account
of its greater ductility. Hence it at once began to displace iron in
the construction of the highest class of steam-ships and marine
steam-boilers, whilst of late years it seemed destined to altogether
 supplant iron as a material for the purposes of marine architecture
 and engineering.     As an evidence of the extent to which these
 Siemens and Siemens-Martin Processes have been adopted, it may be

 granted by the patentee, several of them have comprised hundreds of
 furnaces for various purposes. The total production of Siemens mild
 steel was over 340,000 tons in 1881 for Great Britain alone, while the
 Siemens furnaces in use here are approximately only one~third of
 those already set up in America and on the Continent.
    The great things done by Siemens with gas produced in the manner
 referred to above, <U+FB01>rst in the gas glass furnace, described with glowing
 admiration by Faraday on Friday evening, June 20, 1862, in his last
 Royal Institution lecture, and more recently in connexion with the
 great and exceedingly valuable invention just referred to,—the Siemens
 process for making steel, by using the oxygen of iron ore to burn out
 part of the carbon from cast iron,—and still more recently in the
 heating of the retorts for the production of ordinary lighting gas, by
 which a large increase has been obtained in the yield of gas per ton
 of coal used, are achieved results which live after the inventor has
 gone, and which, it is to be hoped, will give encouragement to push
 farther and farther on in practical realisation of the bene<U+FB01>ts to the
world from the legacy of his great inventions.
    For his contributions in this department, towards the better appli
 cation of science to the methods and processes of practice, William
 Siemens received many rewards and honours.
    He received prize medals at the Exhibitions of 1851 and 1862, and
 a Grand Prix at the French Exhibition of 1867 for his regenera
tive gas furnace and steel processes. .In 1874 he was presented with
the “Royal Albert Medal,” and in 1875 with the “ Bessemer Medal”
on account of his scienti<U+FB01>c researches and his inventions relating to
 heat and metallurgy, whilst only last week the Council of the Insti
tution of Civil Engineersv awarded him the Howard Quinquennial
 Prize for the advances he had made in the manufacture of iron and
steel.
   William Siemens    has designated electricity  “ the youngest form of
energy with which      we are practically acquainted,” and there is no
doubt that to himself is due, in considerable degree, the great progress
which has within recent years been made in its practical adaptation to
various purposes.
   It was in the early days of submarine telegraphy that Siemens
entered the <U+FB01>eld of electric engineering, when the possibilities of
ocean telegraphy were just coming into view, and it was therefore to
this particular adaptation of electricity that he <U+FB01>rst applied himself.
He took part in several of the early expeditions for cable laying in the
Mediterranean and the Black Sea, acquiring there the practical
experience, which helped him, in after years, in the arrangement and
equipment of so many successful expeditions for a like purpose.
   In 1858 the extensive telegraph works at Woolwich, now known as

                                       vii
 Siemens Bros., were established by William Siemens in conjunction
 with Mr. Halske of Berlin, and the great undertaking so successfully
carried out by this <U+FB01>rm have more than a commercial interest.          The
 scienti<U+FB01>c    attainments,   together  with the wide experience and great
inventive genius brought to bear by Siemens on the work entrusted
to it, speedily succeeded in raising the <U+FB01>rm to that eminence which it
has ever since held. Alike in land as in sea telegraphic engineering,
 it has long held a <U+FB01>rst place, and while it would be out of place here
to catalogue the various successes in cable laying and repairing of
 the Siemens <U+FB01>rm, we may note that these include the North China,
 and Platino-Braziliera cables, the cables for the Indo-European lines,
 and no less than four Atlantic cables completed, and two new ones in
progress at the time of Siemens" death. Many of the machines and
processes now in use in the manufacture and maintenance of land and
sea telegraph cables have been greatly improved, while some of them
indeed owe their existence to William Siemens. One of these machines,
       “
the Faraday,” which is primarily a cable-laying and lifting machine,
is a perfect monument of Siemens’ practical genius. This vessel was
designed by him in 1874! for the purpose of laying the Direct United
                                       “         ”
States Cables, and was named the Faraday           in grateful remembrance
           “         in         ”     whom
of   that    master     science   to        he owed  so much.
    It is remarkable that a ship capable of doing what no other ship
a<U+FB02>oat can do in the way of manoeuvre, as has been proved by her
success in the difficult and delicate operations of laying and lifting
cables in depths of 2,500 fathoms, and of cable repairing in all
seasons and all weathers, should have been the work of a landsman,
born in the middle of Europe, who early made himself a sailor in
cable-laying expeditions in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, but
whose life has been chie<U+FB02>y devoted to land engineering and science.
    In the most recent advances that have been made in the application
of electrical energy, William Siemens has been a pioneer, and it is
in connexion with these that his name has become a household word.
In the numerous and important inventions pertaining to this
department of electrical engineering, to which the name applies,
William Siemens has been associated with his brother Werner, and
the world has pro<U+FB01>ted largely by this brotherly co-operation of genius.
More than a quarter of a century ago they brought out what is now
known as the Siemens armature, which was shown at the London
Exhibition of 1862, mounted between the poles of a multiple steel
horseshoe magnet, and serving for the transmitter in an electric
telegraph.      That was what we may now call the one-coil Siemens
armature.       It suggested inevitably the mounting of two or more
coils on the same iron core, in meridional planes at equal angles
round the axis, and as nearly equal and similar in all respects as is
allowed      by the   exigencies   of  completing   the  circuits with the

                                       viii
    di<U+FB01>erent portions of wire laid over one another, and bent to one side
    or the other, to avoid passing through the space occupied by the
    bearing shaft. The principle of electro-magnetic augmentation and
    maintenance of a current without the aid of steel or other permanent
    magnets, invented by Werner Siemens, and also independently by
    Wheatstone and S. A. Varley, was communicated to the Royal
    Society by William Siemens on February 14:, 1867, in his celebrated
                  “
    paper on the Conversion of Dynamical into Electric Force without
    the aid of Permanent Magnets.”       This paper is peculiarly interesting,
    as being the <U+FB01>rst scienti<U+FB01>c enunciation of that wonderful          electro
    magnetic principle, on which are founded the dynamo-electric
    machines of the present day. Soon after came the Paccinotti
    Gramme ring, from which followed naturally the suggestion of the
    mode of connexion between the coils of a multiple-coil Siemens
    armature, described in the Siemens-Alteneck         patent of. 1873, and
    made the foundation of the Siemens dynamo as we now have it,
    whether as constructed by the Siemens <U+FB01>rm, or with the modi<U+FB01>cations
    of details and proportions, valuable for many practical purposes,
    which have been contributed by Edison and Hopkinson.                   The
    evolution of the Siemens armature, as we now have      it,in this splendid
    machine, from the rudimentary type which the writer saw a quarter
    of century ago,
      a               is one of the most beautiful products of development
.   by inventive genius, and   is more like to the growth of a <U+FB02>ower than
    to almost anything in the way of mechanism made by man.
       It unnecessary here to enter upon the consideration of the many
          is
    new forms of apparatus for electric lighting given to the public by
    the Siemens <U+FB01>rm, but we may perhaps mention the highly successful
    Siemens arc-lamp, and the various measuring instruments, particu
    larly the Watt meter; this instrument being the realisation of a mode
                                                                               ”
    of estimating electrical energy or activity  bya new unit—the “ Watt
    —suggested by Siemens in his Presidential Address to the British
    Association at Southampton in 1882. He at the same time suggested
    the
         “ Joule ” as a unit of heat or work, both of which units were at
    once adopted by electrical engineers as convenient practical units.
       Just two months before his death Siemens witnessed the successful
    completion and formal opening for traliic of the Portrush and Bush
    mills electric tramway, one of the most splendid and interesting of
    his achievements.     This railway, which    issituated in the north of
    Ireland, and was the <U+FB01>rst of its kind in this country, now carries
    passengers on a (it-miles line of steep gradients and sharp curves, at a
    good 10 miles an hour, solely by water-power of the River Bush,
    driving, through turbines, a  250-volt Siemens dynamo at a distance of
     7% miles from the Portrush end of the line.
       We have seen how much the labours of William Siemens have
    contributed to make electricity subservient to the wants of mankind,

                                    ix
but, to show what to his mind were the possibilities of its future, we
need only refer to the multifarious purposes to which electricity was
applied at his country residence near Tunbridge Wells.         There elec
tricity might be found doing the great part of the actual work of the
farm—sawing wood, and pumping water, and driving most of the
various mechanical appliances on the premises.          The very latest
use to which it was here applied was for horticultural purposes.
The electric light was used during the hours of darkness to continue
the sun’s work, in promoting the growth and ripening of plants and
fruits, or, in other experiments, to compete with the sun in this
work; the results in this latest application being made the subject
of papers by Siemens, contributed to the Royal Society in March,
1880, and to the York Meeting of the British Association in 1881.
   In the foregoing, we have sought to exhibit the life work of Sir
William Siemens, not in its chronological order, but as viewed in the
two departments “Utilisation of Heat” and “Utilisation of Elec
tricity.” Of the thirty-<U+FB01>ve papers which appear under his name in
the Catalogue of Scienti<U+FB01>c Papers, and which do not include the last
ten years of his life, all are with, perhaps, one not happy exception,
 more or less directly the result of his e<U+FB01>orts in one or other of
these directions.     The exception referred to is his paper “ On the
 Conservation of Solar Energy,” contributed to the Royal Society,
                                                 “ A New
 February, 1882, and embodied in an article,              Theory of the
                                                   ”
 Sun,” published in the “Nineteenth Century          of April, 1882; but
 even this may well be considered no exception, from its evident con
 nexion with the principle of “Regeneration of Heat,” and treating,
 as it does, of the sun imagined as a great regenerative gas furnace.
 Careful consideration of the circumstances, however, shows this view
 to be wholly untenable. While his papers are thus almost wholly of
 a practical nature, his work in the domain of pure science has been
 neither slight nor unimportant, because, in experimentally developing
 his inventions, his mind was ever on the alert, and hence his e<U+FB01>orts
 towards the practical application of the results of science, in many
 cases, served to put these results in a clearer light.
    Sir William Siemens has received recognition of his services to
 pure and applied science from the Emperor of Brazil, the Shah of
 Persia, and from France both under the Empire and the Republic,
 whilst in April last Her Majesty was graciously pleased to confer
 upon him the honour of knighthood.       He was a member of nearly all
the scienti<U+FB01>c societies of Great Britain; he was the senior member of
council of the Institution of Civil Engineers; he was elected a
member of the Royal Society in 1862, and has twice served on the
 council of that body.     He has been President of the Institution of
Mechanical Engineers, twice of the Society of Telegraph Engineers,
 of the Iron and Steel Institute, and last year, at Southampton, of the
                                                                c

                                      X
British Association; whilst at the time of his death he was Chairman
of the Council of the Society of Arts.         He was made a D.C.L. of
Oxford honoa'is causd in 1870, an LL.D. of Glasgow in 1880, of Dublin
in 1882, in which year the University of Wiirzburg also bestowed on
him its honorary Ph.D. He was a corresponding or ordinary member
of several learned societies in Europe and in America.
    In private life Sir William Siemens, with his lively, bright intelli
gence always present, and eager to give pleasure and bene<U+FB01>t to those
around him, was a most lovable man, singularly unsel<U+FB01>sh and full of
kind thought and care for others.
   \Ve shall conclude by quoting     the closing lines of an article which
appeared     in the “Times ” of November 21, 1883, “ On the Life and
Work of Sir William Siemens.” They are words with which all who
knew him or came in contact with him can fully sympathise, and
they will, besides, serve to indicate the estimation in which he was
held by the people of his adopted country :——“Those who knew him
may mourn the kindly heart, the generous noble nature, so tolerant
of imperfect knowledge, so impatient only at charlatanism and dis
honesty ; the nation at large has lost a faithful servant, chief among
those who live only to better the life of their fellow-men by subduing
the forces of nature to their use.       Looking back along the line of
England’s scienti<U+FB01>c worthies,      there  are few who have served the
neople better than this her adopted son—few, if any, whose life’s
record will show so long a list of useful labours.”
    J EAN BAPTISTE  Arrest DUMAS was born at Alais, in the Department
of the Gard, July 14, 1800.
    The little town of Alais was almost     unknown     at the beginning Of
this century, being inhabited by only      a few thousand     souls. Never
 theless, young Dumas found there           everything conducive to the
 expansion of a youthful intellect and     to the development of a well
built frame.
    A  college which had then no lack of pupils   ful<U+FB01>lled  the requirements
of the boy’s early education, initiating him more especially in the
 study of Latin, so congenial to the classical traditions of the neigh
 born-hood.
    These assooiations could not but have had a tendency to direct the
 mind of young Dumas to the study of the past; but there were other
 in<U+FB02>uences, not less potent, continually calling him back to the present,
 Indeed, the town of Alais, by its unique situation, a<U+FB02>'orded oppor
 tunities of observing nature and the processes of adapting her products
 to the use of man, which proved not less attractive to the future
 Academician.      Both in his speeches and writings he frequently refers
 with gratitude to these varied impressions of his early youth at
 Alais.

                                      xi
    It would be dif<U+FB01>cult to imagine a happier complement to a classical
education than the lessons taught at every step in this delightful
country.    Nor were they lost upon young Dumas, who at fourteen
years  of age, in addition to his rare attainments in classical literature,
had acquired a rudimentary knowledge of the several natural sciences.
Having made up his mind to enter the navy, he might at once have
presented himself for examination, had it not been for an insuf<U+FB01>cient
acquaintance with some branches of mathematics, in which, owing to
the limited instruction given at the college, his information had
hitherto remained of a very elementary character.                        .
    While Dumas was still preparing for his naval examination, the
political events of 181445 obliged his family to renounce this project
and to select a career for the youth which would entail less sacri<U+FB01>ce.
    Dumas accordingly entered as apprentice at an apothecary’s in
Alais. This position, in which he pursued his <U+FB01>rst practical studies,
 did not afford much opportunity for scienti<U+FB01>c progress, and the young
 man became soon impressed with a strong desire to give up this place
 and to quit his native town.     This feeling. indeed, became so intense
that his parents, moved by his evident distress, thought it best to
accede to his wishes.
    Soon after, in 1816, Dumas travelled on foot from Alais to Geneva,
where he found everything to expand his ideas, to stimulate his
 emulation, and thus to prepare him for his future career.            There
 were lectures on botany by M. de Caudolle, on physics by M. Pictet,
 and on chemistry by M. Gaspard de la Rive.           He had, besides, the
 superintendence of a tolerably large laboratory, belonging to the
 pharmacy of Le Boyer, and formerly used for the courses of applied
 chemistry given by M. Tingry.
    The pharmaceutical students, who frequently united in botanical
excursions during the summer, started the idea of winter meetings
for scienti<U+FB01>c studies. Seeing that Dumas had a laboratory at his
disposal, it was suggested that he should give them a course of
experimental chemistry.       This was his début in the professorial
career.
    Meanwhile Dumas had become introduced to Gaspard de la Rive,
to Theodore de Saussure, and to De Candolle, and each of these in
his way began to take a warm and lasting interest in him; they
encouraged his studies, and assisted him to the best of their powers
in his pursuits. It was most likely at the instigation of his new
friends that Dumas, reviving his early naval predilections, began
seriously to think of, and to prepare for, an exploring expedition to
some distant part of the world.        A monograph on the Gentianeaa,
chie<U+FB02>y written for the purpose of becoming familiar with the language
and the ideas of botanical science, was a fruit of these aspirations.
   But this was not to be his mission. Biot’s great treatise, which for
                                                             0 2

                                     xii
half  a century was to remain the standard text-book on physics,      had
just   appeared, and Dumas had found, more especially in the         <U+FB01>rst
volume, plenty of subjects directing his attention          to the art of
experimenting, of making observations, of consulting nature, and of
discovering the laws of her phenomena;         The “ Annales de Chimie ”
o<U+FB01>ered him, moreover, splendid models in the papers of Berzelius,
Davy, Gay-Lussac, and Thénard.            At the same time he studied
with indefatigable zeal the works of Lavoisier, and the “Statique
                                             -
 Chimique” of Berthollet.
   Dumas was then eighteen years of age. It was about that time
that he had the good fortune to make himself useful to one of the
principal physicians of the town, a circumstance which contributed
not a little to advance him in the circles in which he had hitherto
lived. Dr. Coindet asked him to examine some carbonised sponges,
and to ascertain more especially whether iodine was present in them.
Having after some days received an af<U+FB01>rmative answer, Dr. Coindet
no longer hesitated to consider iodine aspeci<U+FB01>c against goitre. Dumas
was then asked to give his attention to the subject and to point out
the preparations in which iodine might be most conveniently admin
istered. He suggested tincture of iodine, potassic iodide, and iodised
potassic iodide. Soon afterwards these new remedies were mentioned
in a German journal published at Zurich, and it is in this connexion
that the name of Dumas is <U+FB01>rst met with in scienti<U+FB01>c literature.
   About that time Dr. J. L. Prévost, after an absence of several years,
returned to Geneva.       He had long been resident in Edinburgh and
Dublin, devoting himself to comprehensive studies in the several
departments of medicine.        Among these was a particular examina
tion of the physiological eifects of digitalis, and he was naturally
anxious to obtain the active principle of the plant free from all
foreign matter accompanying it. He invited Dumas to join him in
this inquiry.    The problem to be solved consisted in successively
removing all that appeared inert so as to concentrate the active con
stituent, which would ultimately remain in a state of purity.         The
chemical properties of this principle being unknown, the only means
of estimating the concentration was to observe the e<U+FB01>ect of the con
centrated substance upon animals.        This slow and irksome process
of elimination   did  not  lead to any result;  it is well known that the
isolation of digitaline was not effected until some years later.      But
however unsuccessful, these joint labours gave rise to a far more
fruitful collaboration.
   Whilst studying together the physiology of Richerand, a work then
in great repute, and the memoirs of Magendie, which were beginning
to attract increased attention, the two friends resolved to engage in a
series of chemico-physiological researches.
   It seemed natural enough to commence these researches by a

                                     xiii
 renewed study of the blood, and they were soon able to publish a
 paper upon this subject. This appeared in the “Bibliotheque Uni
 verselle de Geneve,” and in the title Dumas still <U+FB01>gures as Eléve de
 Pharmacie.     The results arrived at by the young inquirers for a
 long  time satis<U+FB01>ed the wants of science, and if our knowledge of the
 blood has been considerably expanded by many subsequent observers,
 the experiments of Prévost and Dumas have invariably served as a
 starting point for these inquiries.
    It was about that time that the death of Princess Charlotte had
 excited a feeling of sorrow all over Europe.      The pathological pro
 blem presented by this sad event induced the two experimentalists to
 resume the study of the transfusion of blood.        This problem has
since been frequently examined, but these renewed inquiries have
 added but little to the knowledge elicited by Prévost and Dumas’
 researches  upon the subject.
    A  very important result at which they arrived was, moreover, the
 demonstration of the presence of urea in the blood of animals the
 kidneys of which had been removed.            They inferred from this
 observation that the function of the kidneys is not to produce but to
 eliminate urea formed in the blood. Their experiments have been
 repeated by the most distinguished observers, among whom it su<U+FB02>ices
 to name Gmelin, Tiedemaun, and Mitscherlich, and the conclusions
 to which they led are therefore generally adopted by physiologists.
 We should not, however, leave it unmentioned that, during the last
few years, some dissenting voices have been heard, and that some
 modern physiologists believe they have proved that urea is also gene—
rated by the kidneys.     But if it should ultimately be proved, beyond
 doubt, that the kidneys, like many other organs, more especially the
 liver, have the power of producing urea, elimination of urea formed
elsewhere would be still the principal function         of the kidneys,
although not the only one, as Prévost and Dumas have been led to
                                                          '
believe from their experiments.
    From the researches on blood Prévost and Dumas proceeded to the
examination of the phenomenon of fecundation, the knowledge of
which they considerably expanded. It deserves more especially to be
noticed that, notwithstanding some previous observations by Swam
merdam and Spallanzani upon the subject, modern physiologists are
unanimous in recognising Prevost and Dumas as the discoverers
of the phenomenon of segmentation in the ovum of the Batrachians.
At the same time these investigators observed that at a certain
stage of fecundation there escapes from the ovary of the Mammalia
a limpid almost microscopic vesicle which enters the Fallopian
tube, and proceeds to the uterus, where, when impregnated by the
spermatozoids of the male, it is <U+FB01>xed, and, increasing in size and
development, gives rise to the fcetus.       Prévost and Dumas must

                                      xiv
thus be looked upon      as  the precursors of  CIE. Baer, whose classical
researches   on the genesis    of the ovum  in the Mammalia  and in man
appeared   in 1827.
    Simultaneously with their researches on blood and fecundation,
Prévost and Dumas published several other physiological investiga
tions not immediately connected with the main subjects of their
studies. The urine and the organs of secretion of frogs' successively
engaged their attention.        They also studied the phenomena accom
panying the contraction of muscular <U+FB01>bre.
    Lastly, Prévost and Dumas’ suggestion as to the treatment of
stone by electricity should not be left unnoticed.     Their experiments
showed that the current of a powerful battery is capable of destroying
and dissolving the phosphatic calculi of the bladder, without its
mucous membrane being materially a<U+FB01>ected. Although, at a sub
sequent period, these researches         were continued and materially
enlarged by the late Dr. Bence Jones, the author of this sketch
has not been able to learn that the treatment indicated by these
remarkable results has been successfully applied in surgery.
    At this period, 6.0., in 1822, Dumas might have settled at Geneva,
and many circumstances led him to think seriously of doing so.         An
incident, however, which happened at that time, and which at <U+FB01>rst
sight seemed in no way likely to in<U+FB02>uence a well-matured plan of
life, induced him within a few days to change his mind.         He made
the acquaintance of Alexander von Humboldt, who invited him to be
his companion during a few days’ stay at Geneva.          The short inter
course with this extraordinary man suddenly expanded his aspira
tions.
    The memorable hours he had spent with him had opened a new
world to his mind. He had been more especially impressed with
what he had told him of Parisian life, of the happy collaboration of
men of science, and of the unlimited facilities which the French
capital o<U+FB01>ered to young men wishing to devote themselves to scienti<U+FB01>c
pursuits.    He began to think that Paris was the only place where
under the auspices of the leaders of physical and chemical science,
with whom, he had no doubt, he should soon become acquainted, he
might hope to <U+FB01>nd the advice and assistance which would enable him
 to carry out the labours over which he had been pondering for some
time. His mind was soon made up—he must go to Paris.
    Dumas’ removal to Paris, which took place in 1823, brought the
 physiological labours in which he had been engaged along with
 Prévost to a conclusion. Though the separation from a friend, with
 whom he had been in daily intercourse for so many years, must have
 been deeply felt by the young savant, who had now to steer his course
 alone, he had the good fortune to become acquainted with three young
 men of about his own age, with whom he soon entered into friendly

                                   Xv
alliance.   These were Victor Audouin, the zoologist, well-known even
at that time, Adolphe Brongniart, who had already published several
important botanical papers, and Henri Milne Edwards, who had just
terminated his medical studies and was working for his degree.       The
friendship of these three men, matured by daily intercourse and
subsequently strengthened, if possible, by family ties, has ever been
looked upon by Dumas as one of the most important acquisitions of
his life, not only proving to him an inexhaustible source of the purest
pleasures, but likewise materially assisting in shaping that successful
career which has made the name of Dumas a household word in the
mouths of chemists.
    If a legitimate desire to become acquainted with the leading men
of science of that day was one of the principal motives in determining
Dumas to leave Geneva, his wishes were grati<U+FB01>ed far beyond his most
sanguine expectations. Nothing could have surpassed the kindness
with which the young aspirant was received by the very men to
whom he had hitherto been looking up with mingled sentiments of
reverence and awe.      Indeed, a most kindly feeling of good fellowship
towards youthful workers in the same <U+FB01>eld of inquiry was a noble
feature in the character of nearly all men of science of that period.
La Place, Berthollet, Vauquelin, Gay-Lussac, Thénard, Alexandre
Brongniart, Cuvier, Geo<U+FB02>'roy Saint Hilaire, Arago, Ampere, Poisson,
all gave striking proofs of their desire to smooth the path of young
investigators, and thus to promote the advance of science.
    The place of Répétiteur de Chimie t0 Thénard’s course of lectures
 in the Ecole Polytechnique having become vacant at that time, Arago
proposed Dumas for the of<U+FB01>ce, and he was elected by the council of
the school before he had become aware that he wasa candidate. There
was at that period in Paris an establishment for evening lectures on
literature and science, resembling in a measure the Royal Institution
of Albemarle Street, though the literary element predominated. The
chair of chemistry at that institution, often called Lyceum, but
better known by its later name of Athenwum, had become vacant,
and Ampere succeeded in procuring the appointment for Dumas
without having previously spoken to him on the subject.
    From this moment, owing to the in<U+FB02>uence of his two illustrious
protectors, the study of physiological questions receded more and
more in the background, while his full energy was directed towards
the solution of chemical problems.
    Still many circumstances conspired which prevented Dumas from
engaging much in scienti<U+FB01>c researches during the <U+FB01>rst years of his
stay in Paris. His lectures at the Athenaaum required a great deal
of preparation; he was, moreover, in his capacity as assistant to
 Thénard’s course at the Ecole Polytechnique, assiduously practising
the art of experimenting in public, in which he soon attained the

                                    xvi
highest degree of pro<U+FB01>ciency.     At the same time he founded (in 1824),
with his friends Audouin and Brongniart, the “ Annales des Sciences
Naturelles,” and also began to collect the materials necessary for the
                            “ Traité de Chimie
publication of his grand                         appliquée aux Arts,” the
<U+FB01>rst volume of which appeared in 1828.
    But if this period was for Dumas one of incessant labour, and
often of the most strenuous efforts, it also enabled him to realise the
most ardent of his aspirations.        For some time Dumas had been
intimate with the family of Alexandre Brongniart, the father of his
friend Adolphe, and was not long before he became betrothed to
Mdlle. Herminie Brongniart, the eldest daughter of the illustrious
geologist. It was on February 18, 1826, that the matrimonial alliance
was concluded which has been for more than half a century a source
of the purest happiness for both consorts.
    At the very commencement of his labours in the cause of organic
chemistry Dumas had found himself face to face with a powerful
rival in Germany, who, setting out by a curious coincidence from the
same starting-point, the study of pharmacy, had entered the lists
without passing through the physiological and natural history stages
of his competitor. Liebig and Dumas have had, indeed, some strange
encounters on the <U+FB01>eld of science.        These encounters, to which we
may have to refer hereafter, were occasionally rather violent, as might
have been expected when two young and <U+FB01>ery champions, each per
suaded of the justice of his views, were rushing at each other.     Once
or twice perhaps in   the heat of  battle  an unguarded word  might have
sounded like personal provocation ; but however <U+FB01>erce the aggression,
the combatants never forgot that they were both <U+FB01>ghting under the
banner of truth, and the contest having been decided, the antagonists
invariably separated with increased regard for each other.
    But we must return to Dumas’ early labours in the <U+FB01>eld of experi
 mental investigation.    They were by no means exclusively devoted to
 organic chemistry; indeed, one of his <U+FB01>rst researches, which riveted
 at once the eyes of the scienti<U+FB01>c world upon the young French chemist,
 was of a much larger scope. We allude to the classical paper, “ On some
 Points of the Atomic Theory,” which was published in the “Annales
                              " for
 de Chimie et de Physique           1826, and in which the author soars
 to  the very heights of chemical science.       Whoever to-day, after a
 lapse of nearly sixty years, peruses this admirable memoir, which aims
 at the solution of old problems by new methods, cannot but grate
 fully acknowledge that a good deal of what has long since become
 common property, is rooted in its substance; but he will at the same
 time be astonished to perceive that many of our modern views, which
 we are in the habit of considering as the acquirement of the last few
 decades, had already found expression in this paper.
    In glancing back at the results of this memoir in the light of our

                                     xvii
 present views, we perceive at once what a start the French chemist
 had gained on his contemporaries.         “  I am engaged in a series of
 experiments,”   he says, “intended   to <U+FB01>x  the atomic weights of a con
 siderable number of bodies, by determining their density in the state
 of gas or vapour. There remains in this case but one hypothesis to
 be made, which is accepted by all physicists.         It consists in sup
 posing that in all elastic <U+FB02>uids observed under the same conditions,
 the molecules are placed at equal distances, 11.12.,that they are present
 in them in equal numbers.”
    It is obvious that the .author opens his inquiry with the very con
 ceptions which form the basis of our present views in chemical philo
 sophy; and it is only to be wondered at that the happy enlistment of
 Avogadro’s ideas into the service of chemistry, which we owe to
 Dumas’ initiatory sagacity, should for more than a quarter of a
century almost have fallen into oblivion.
    Having premised in lucid terms the general scope of his inquiry,
 Dumas proceeds to describe the several modi<U+FB01>cations of the well
 known method of taking vapour-densities with which he has endowed
science, and which went forth from his hands in such a state of con
summate perfection that there has scarcely been room left for subse
 quent emendation.
   "The narrow compass of this sketch does not permit us to quote the
numerous results communicated by Dumas in his paper; we will
mention, however, that the determination of the vapour-density of
chloride and <U+FB02>uoride of silicon elicited the view now held regarding
the constitution of silicic acid, thus overthrowing the old formula
of this compound upon which Berzelius had based his classi<U+FB01>cation of
silicious minerals.
    There were other experimental researches of importance carried
out by Dumas about this period. It had long been his intention to
resume the study of the compound ethers, to which he had devoted
considerable attention at Geneva. In conjunction with Boullay he
proceeded to an elaborate investigation of nitrons, acetic, benzoic, and
oxalic ethers.    The composition of these substances was <U+FB01>nally settled
by   accurate  combustions   and vapour-density determinations.      They
further elicited by unequivocal experiments the capital fact that the
decomposition of compound ethers by alkalies gives rise to quantities
of acids and alcohol, the joint weight of which is greater than
the Weight of the compound ethers submitted to experiment, and
by accurately determining this di<U+FB01>erence they succeeded for the <U+FB01>rst
time in establishing the nature I  V
                                      of compound ethers on the solid
foundatiou'of experiment.
    These investigations    led to other inquiries teeming with most
remarkable results, among which, those on the formation                 of
oxamide, on chlorocarbonic ether, and on urethane may be specially

                                    xviii
mentioned.      Here, also, the splendid papers on wood-spirit and sper;
maceti, jointly published by Dumas and Peligot, deserve to be
                                                                           '
noticed, although they belong to a somewhat later period.
   While the experiments on the others sketched in the preceding
paragraphs were still going on, a strange incident directed the
attention of Dumas to a perfectly different order of phenomena, the
study of which occupied him for many years of his life, and ulti
mately led him to one of his <U+FB01>nest conceptions, the theory of substi
tution. It is not generally known that it is to a soire'e at the Tuileries
that the origin of the substitution-theory        must be traced.      One
evening the visitors at the palace were greatly incommoded by irri
tating vapours diffused throughout the apartments, and obviously
arising from the wax candles burning with a smoky <U+FB02>ame. Alexandre
Brongniart, in his capacity of director of the porcelain manufactory
at Sevres, was looked upon as chemist to the king’s household, and it
appeared but natural that he should be consulted respecting this
unpleasant incident.      Brongniart intrusted his son-in-law with the
task of investigating the suspicious candles, and Dumas was all the
more inclined to engage in this inquiry, that he had already made
some experiments in that direction, having been asked by a merchant
to suggest a method of bleaching certain kinds of wax which resisted
the ordinary processes, and thus remained unsaleable.            Nor had
yDumas any dif<U+FB01>culty     in  supplying   the explanation.   The  irritating
 vapours were chlorhydric acid, and it was thus obvious that the
candle manufacturer supplying the palace had made use of wax
bleached with chlorine, and that the chlorine-bleached wax had re
tained chlorine, which during the combustion of the wax was evolved
in the form of chlorhydric acid. The origin of the inconvenience
 experienced at Charles X’s soire'e was thus satisfactorily explained,
 and its recurrence easily obviated. At the same time it was proved
 by experiment that organic substances when treated with chlorine
 are capable of <U+FB01>xing this element in quantities far too large to admit
 the assumption of its presence being an accidental contamination.        A
 new <U+FB01>eld of investigation was thus opened, on which within a com
 paratively short time a harvest of results of startling novelty was
 reaped by Dumas.
    It is well known that the researches suggested by the experiment
 above mentioned led to the view of chlorine being capable of replacing
 hydrogen, atom for atom, in organic compounds.
    This view, diametrically opposed to the dualistic conception of the
 electrochemical theory of the time, was vehemently contested by
 Berzelius and his school, who exhausted the resources of argument,
 scorn, and even ridicule against them.       Nevertheless, Dumas’ ideas
 rapidly took root, and but a few years later substitutional conceptions
 began to prevail in the researches of the younger generation             of

                                    xix
chemists.    An additional impetus    was   given to the movement when
it was joined by Laurent, who, though often      so much at variance with
Dumas, as to become, more especially in consequence of questions of
priority as to certain collateral ideas, his declared opponent, has
nevertheless, by amplifying the original conceptions and by pre
senting in his unremitting researches ever new and welcome illus
trations of them, assisted more perhaps than any other chemist in the
propagation of the theory of substitution.
   We cannot, of course, attempt to examine the several experimental
researches, extending over a considerable space of time and embracing
a great variety of subjects, which served as scaffolding to Dumas
when building up his substitutional and typical conceptions; all we
can do is to allude in a few words to the experiments which furnished
him with his principal illustrations.
   Proceeding chronologically,_we should have to refer in the <U+FB01>rst
place to Dumas’ experiments on cinnamon oil and cinnamic acid.
Again, excellent illustrations of substitution are furnished by his work
on ole<U+FB01>ant gas and ordinary ether.
   His examination of the action of chlorine upon alcohol, too, served
to illustrate his theory; although in these experiments he was fore
stalled by Liebig, who by his researches had been led to the discovery
of chloral and chloroform.     But if Dumas lost the discovery of these
two compounds, he had at all events the satisfaction of establishing
their true composition, and of thus supplying the key to the correct
interpretation both of the formation of chloral from alcohol and
of its decomp0sition, <U+FB01>rst pointed out by Liebig, into formic acid
and chloroform, when submitted to the action of alkalies.
   But the inquiry, which more perhaps than any other has contri
buted to establish Dumas’ ideas in the minds of chemists, is his
splendid investigation of the action of chlorine upon acetic acid. The
trichloracetic acid formed in this reaction retains all the characteristic
properties of the mother compound, its salts and its ethers resemble
those of acetic acid, and when Berzelius and the champions of dualistic
views still endeavoured, by constrained interpretation, to prove acetic
and chloracetic acid to differ in constitution, Dumas showed that even
their metamorphoses    are strictly analogous.
   Among the numerous researches undertaken with a view of eluci
dating the theory of substitution, a joint inquiry of Dumas and Stas
on the action of alkalies on alcohols and ethers must not be forgotten.
They prove that the alkalies act as oxidising agents, hydrogen being
evolved, whilst the acids belonging to the alcohols are simultaneously
produced. Amylic alcohol, then just brought to light by Dumas and
Cahours’ researches, is thus found to yield valeric acid, up to that time
obtained only from Valeriana o<U+FB01>‘icinalis.
   A few years later Dumas returned once more to the acids generated

                                   XX
by the oxidation of the alcohols. But what on this occasion <U+FB01>xed his
attention was the simple relation in which these acids stand to each
other. For the <U+FB01>rst time, indeed, we hear of the series of fatty or
aliphatic acids.   The observations recorded by Dumas have greatly
contributed to develop the classi<U+FB01>cation of organic compounds in
homologous series. A very important series of this kind was indicated
by Dumas when, on this occasion, he showed that between formic and
margaric acids not less than <U+FB01>fteen acids could be assumed to exist,
di<U+FB01>ering from one another by a constant elementary difference, CH2,
of which nine at least were known at that time.
   The number of elements with which organic chemistry works in
building up her structures being so very limited, it was but natural
that from the very <U+FB01>rst considerable attention should have been
bestowed upon the quantitative analysis of organic substances; and that
we <U+FB01>nd the very chemists who laid the foundation of organic chemistry
also engaged in elaborating the methods for determining the organic
elements.    There are, indeed, no two chemists to whom we are more
deeply indebted for the growth of our methods of analysing organic
substances than Liebig and Dumas, and we are delighted that in the
language of the laboratory their names remain associated with the
processes they have introduced.      We speak of Liebig’s method of
estimating carbon and hydrogen, and of Dumas’ process for deter
mining nitrogen.
   Referring to the methods of determining the composition of organic
substances, it is but natural that we should allude to the services
which Dumas has rendered to organic analysis, by the revision jointly
carried out with Stas of the atomic weight of carbon. This revision
furnished the number 12 instead of 12'24, which was the number
adopted by Berzelius.      Dumas and Stas’s investigation will ever be
looked upon as a model for experimental researches, and their atomic
weight of carbon, although it has still suffered a tri<U+FB02>ing modi<U+FB01>cation
by subsequent researches, has since been universally adopted.
    The results arrived at in this inquiry naturally also led to a revi
sion of the atomic weight of oxygen—in other words, to a revision of
the composition of water—which appeared all the more desirable,
since chemists at that period very generally began to use the atomic
weight of hydrogen as the atomic unit instead of that of oxygen which
had been previously employed. Experiments made by Dumas on a
 scale not hitherto attempted, and consiting in the reduction of large
quantities of oxide of copper—from 300 to 900 grams were used—and
determining the oxygen supplied by the oxide reduced as well as the
water formed, showed the volume weight of oxygen to be exactly 16,
and thus the fundamental numbers 1, 12, and 16 for hydrogen, carbon,
and oxygen were acquired which for a long time satis<U+FB01>ed the wants
of chemists.

                                        xxi
    The corrections to which the experiments previously mentioned had
led, as regards the composition of carbonic acid and water, suggested
also a re-examination of atmospheric air.              Dumas undertook this
investigation in conjunction with his friend Boussingault.                The
method of analysis adopted was exclusively ponderal.
    The composition of air thus arrived at by Dumas and Boussingault
is—
                                    By weight.         By volume.
                   Oxygen    . . . .   23      . . . .    2081
                   Nitrogen.   . . .   77      . . . .    79'19
                                      100      . . . .  lOO'OO
    The recti<U+FB01>cation of the atomic weight of carbon and the inquiries
more immediately connected therewith must be looked upon as the
prelude of Dumas’s long series of researches on the atomic weights of
 the elements.    They were mostly published at a later period (from
 1858 to 1860).    A few fragmentary statements must suf<U+FB01>ce to convey
 to the reader an idea of the magnitude and variety of these researches.
 They embrace not less than thirty elements, or about one-half of those
 then known; the number of experiments made for the purpose of
 <U+FB01>xing their atomic weight closely approach 200, so that on an aVerage
 about six separate analyses were made in each case.
    Among the researches carried out by Dumas in conjunction with
 other chemists we have still to notice those with Malaguti and
 Leblanc on the transformation of the ammonia salts and amides into
 the alcohol cyanides (nitriles), those with Cahours on the composition
 of the neutral nitrogenous substances in the vegetal and animal
 organism, those with Milne Edwards on the conversion of sugar into
 fat (wax) within the organism of the bee.
    The last experimental inquiries published by Dumas are his re
 searches on alcoholic fermentation (1872), and an interesting paper
 on the occlusion of oxygen in silver, which appeared as late as 1878.
    Lucidity of exposition and grace of style are not necessarily asso
 ciated with the gift of successfully interrogating nature. It happens
 but too frequently that the results of admirable inquiries are almost
 hidden in papers hastily, not to say negligently, written.        But no one
 ever found fault with Dumas in this respect.           Few chemists, perhaps,
published their researches in a more attractive and lucid form.           And
the same graceful elegance and perspicuity of style are found in
whatever proceeded from his pen.            One might fancy that he took the
same pains whether it was a friendly letter or an elaborate report, a
festal oration or a philosophic essay that he was writing; or, perhaps,
 we should rather say, they seem all to have been written with the
same facility.
    The works of Dumas present considerable variety, both as to the

                                   xxii
subjects discussed and to the form of treatment adopted.      There are
several elaborate treatises and a great many minor pamphlets.        His
academical notices, his of<U+FB01>cial documents, his municipal reports, his
festal speeches, his opening discourses, his commemoration addresses,
his funeral orations, are countless. We may be allowed brie<U+FB02>y to
allude to his more important writings.
                      “                                      ” deserves
    Among these, his Traité de Chimie appliquée aux Arts
to be noticed <U+FB01>rst. This important work, which is dedicated to Baron
Thénard, consists of eight volumes, the <U+FB01>rst of which, as has been
already stated, appeared as far back as 1828; the last one was pub
lished twenty years later. It is accompanied by a <U+FB01>ne Atlas of Plates.
The treatise has been translated into several languages, the German
edition being by Gottlieb Alexander and Friedrich Engelhart.          In
the preface the author informs us that the book is founded upon the
notes collected for a course of chemical technology extending over
three years, which he had to deliver at the Royal Athenaaum.        And
nothing could give a better idea of the time and energy devoted to
the preparation of these lectures.    The labour of accumulating such
a mass of facts must certainly have been enormous, nor could the
eifort made in disposing them in such luminous order have been
less.
    At a later period, about ten years after the <U+FB01>rst volume of the
“ Traité de Chimie appliquée aux Arts ” had appeared, Dumas’ cele
brated “ Lecons sur la Philosophie Chimique” were published.          In
these eleven lectures, which. during the summer of 1836, were
delivered in the College of France, he traces the development of
chemical doctrines from remotest antiquity up to the time at which
the course was given. Indeed, the last lecture is devoted to the
generation of electricity by chemical action, to the chemical effects of
the battery, to the ever-memorable experiments of Sir Humphry
 Davy, and to thee lectro-chemical theory he founded thereon, as well
as to the electro-chemical theories of Ampere and Berzelius; while it
concludes with a survey of Faraday’s electrolytical researches.
    Among the numerous writings of Dumas none, perhaps, has found
a more cordial reception in wide-spread circles than the lecture with
which on August 23, 1841, he concluded his course of chemistry in
the Medical School of Paris.      This lecture is published under the
 title “ Essai de Statique Chimique des Etres Organisés,” par MM.
Dumas et Boussingault, and gives in a simple form the principal
features of the life of plants and animals considered from a chemical
point of View, presenting a most eloquent re'sume' of the chemical and
physiological researches in which the two friends, either individually
orjointly, had been engaged for many years.
    The publication of this lecture gave rise to a dispute between
Dumas and Liebig regarding the priority of the ideas propounded.

                                  xxiii
therein.   The great German chemist having but a year previously, in
                                            “ Organic
1840,   published his celebrated work,                 Chemistry in its
Application to Agriculture and Physiology,” had been naturally led
to investigations of a similar order concerning the chemical pheno
mena of animal life, and was then actually preparing his “ Chemistry
applied to Animal Physiology.”        Liebig, no doubt, had freely stated
the results of his researches in lectures delivered long before the
publication of Dumas and Bonssingault’s pamphlet; but there is not
a shadow of proof that Dumas was in<U+FB02>uenced by inquiries which at
the time were not published.     The accusations, it cannot be denied,
rather hastily hazarded by Liebig, could not but cause a temporary
estrangement between the two great chemists. Fortunately it was of
only short duration, and left, as we already have had occasion to
learn from their own months, no bitterness in their minds. Nor was
there any cause for such estrangement.            Indeed, the unbiassed
reader of to-day no longer doubts that the conceptions which formed
the subject of dispute were independently arrived at by both inquirers.
And we are all the more con<U+FB01>rmed in this view when we learn that
documents have since been found which unmistakably prove that as
far back as 1792 Lavoisier was acquainted with the mutual relation
presented by the phenomena of vegetal and animal life.
   We have still to allude to the important series of commemoration
addresses which Dumas delivered on many of his departed friends
and colleagues.    Each one of these addresses, which collected would
<U+FB01>ll an imposing volume, is a work of art we are never tired. of con
templating ; each one attains its end by giving a life-like portrait of
the person commemorated, aportrait which remains indelibly stamped
on our memory.      We know not which to admire most, the concise
ness which excludes all that is non-essential from the sketch, or the
poetic inspiration which <U+FB01>res the monumental style and throws upon
the form it pictures the light of an ideal conception.     Nor are these
addresses wanting in numerous interesting particulars which, drawn
from the author’s own personal intercourse with his heroes, give a
life-like colouring to his portraits.    Such commemoration addresses
Dumas has delivered on Auguste Béroet, Jules Pelouze, Geo<U+FB01>roy Saint
Hilaire, Auguste do 13. Rive, Alexandre and Adolphe Brongniart,
Guizot, Antoine Balard, Count Rumford, Victor Regnault, Charles
and Henri Sainte Claire-Deville.
   Nor should, when Dumas’s commemoration addresses are enume
rated, his beautiful Faraday lecture be left unnoticed.        It is well
known that soon after Faraday’s death in 1867 the Council of the          .
Chemical Society of London organised a periodical celebration of his
life and labours by instituting a triennial prize to be conferred upon
scienti<U+FB01>c men of all countries whom they proposed from time to time
to invite for the purpose of rendering homage to the memory of the

                                    xxiv
  great experimental inquirer of our century.      It was Dumas who, on
  June 17, 1869, opened this cycle      of  commemoration   addresses by
 delivering a most eloquent lecture in the theatre of the Royal Institu
 tion, where the voice of Faraday himself had been so often heard.
    Essentially different from these commemoration addresses, but not
 less masterly of their kind, are the numerous orations he delivered
 ~sometimes in the name of the Academy, sometimes in his capacity
 as Vice-President    of the Educational Council—at the funeral obse
 quies of distinguished men, amongst which those on Elie de Beaumont
  (1874), on Le Verrier (1877), and on Claude Bernard (1878), may be
 specially mentioned.
    But there were other duties than the delivery of commemoration
 addresses in store for the academician.     Any task imposed upon the
 Institute in the accomplishment of which chemistry was directly or
 indirectly concerned, invariably devolved upon Dumas.
    The “ Comptes Rendus
                             ”
                               of the last <U+FB01>fty years contain an endless
 series of reports addressed to the Academy, which, on a great variety
 of subjects, either alone or in conjunction with some of his colleagues,
 he drew up.      Were we to attempt to do full justice to this part of
 Dumas’ work, we should have to ask the reader to accompany us into
 the most diderent departments of inquiry.
    Some of these reports are elaborate essays, the interest in which
 will not die with the ephemeral conditions of their origin. Among
them, those on Nicolas Leblanc and the early history of the soda
process, on the diseases of the silkworm, on the devastations of. the
phylloxera, may be quoted as illustrations.
    We have still to allude to some literary achievements of another
character. It has been already stated that in 1824 Dumas founded,
in conjunction with his friends Audouin and Adolphe Brongniart, the
“Annales des Sciences Naturelles.”        At a later period, in 1840, he
                                    “ Annales de Chimie et de
became one of the editors of the                              Physique,"
an of<U+FB01>ce which he held up to his death.      He has thus been an e'l' or
of that journal for upwards of forty years, but his contributions to it
extend over more than half a century.
    The lectures at the Athenaeum, together with the literary engage
ments which they had occasioned,        his duties as Répétiteur at the
Ecole Polytechnique, and the experimental researches continued with
out interruption, would have left but little leisure to any man of
ordinary energy. Dumas, however, found time for additional work.
Well aware of the imperfection of scienti<U+FB01>c instruction for technical
purposes in the then existing institutions of France, he conceived
the idea of establishing, in conjunction with his friends Théodore
Olivier and Eugene Péclet, a school intended to supply the defect.
The new school, which assumed the title of “ Ecole Centrale des Arts
et Manufactures,” was opened in 1829.                  .

                                     XXV
     At <U+FB01>rst Dumas lectured at this school on general, analytical, and
 industrial chemistry.     At a later period, when its <U+FB01>nancial position
  permitted the appointment of additional chemical teachers, he con
 <U+FB01>ned himself to either one or other of these branches. The lectures
 on general chemistry he continued up to 1852, when he resigned in
 favour of Cahours.
    The number and variety of lectures which Dumas had to deliver at
 the Ecole Centrale immediately after its opening, in addition to his
 duties at the Polytechnic School, rendered it an absolute necessity for
 him to diminish his engagements elsewhere, so as to enable him to
 <U+FB01>nd time for the various researches he had then in hand. Nor did he
 hesitate (in 1829) to retire from the Professorship at the Royal
 Athenaeum, to which Bussy was then appointed. The alleviation
 thus obtained was not of long duration. In 1832 Guy-Lussac resigned
 his chair at the Sorbonne, which, like a natural inheritance, fell to
 Dumas ; and to this position, which he held up to 1868, when Henri
 Ste. Claire-Deville, after having acted as his substitute since 1853,
 became his successor, was soon added another important appointment.
 For when (in 1835) Thénard withdrew from his Professorship at the
 Ecole Polytechnique, the duties of the of<U+FB01>ce devolved upon Dumas,
 who for twelve years had been a Répétiteur at the School. Dumas
 was, in fact, appointed, and remained in connexion with the Institu
 tion up to 1840, when he resigned in favour of Pelouze.       The list of
 his Professorial appointments, however, is not yet exhausted. After
 the death of Deyeux (in 1839) he was induced, chie<U+FB02>y by Or<U+FB01>la, to
 undertake the duties of _the Chair of Chemistry in the Ecole de
 Médecine.
    In these several positions Dumas had to lecture on very different
 subjects: he had, moreover, to shape his courses according to the
 traditions of the places in which he lectured, and to adjust them to the
 di<U+FB01>erent ages, acquirements, and wants of the students he addressed.
 His unprecedented success as a lecturer is unequivocally proved by
the lively and lasting recollections which his lectures, addressed to
such a diversity of audiences, have left in the minds of his hearers.
Even those who have had the good fortune of attending but a single
one of his lectures will ever remember the clearness and precision
of his reasoning and the attractive grace of his delivery.
    But it was by no means only in lectures that Dumas has sown
broadcast the seeds of chemical science.     He was, in fact, the <U+FB01>rst in
France to adopt that ef<U+FB01>cient system of laboratory teaching so happily
inaugurated by Liebig, which has ever since been a prominent feature
of the German Universities. The laboratory which he had established
in the Ecole Polytechnique, though well adapted for an experimental
inquirer working along with his assistant, was altogether un<U+FB01>t for the
reception of a number of pupils.      That he might be able to associate
                                                               d

                                    xxvi
with experimental students, he founded,     as early as 1832, a laboratory
of research at his own expense.
   Alm0st immediately after the Revolution of February new labours
of the most diverse kind began to encroach upon Dumas’ scienti<U+FB01>c
work.     The political and social upheaval of 1848, shaking, as it did,
the stability of all French institutions, turned into political and admi
nistrative courses many men of mark whose energies had been hitherto
exclusively devoted to the service of science.        It would have been
strange, indeed, had not the want been felt of securing Dumas’ well
tried powers for the public affairs of the country.        Election to the
National Legislative Assembly, appointment as Minister of Agricul
ture and Commerce, admission to the Senate, President of the Muni
cipal Council of Paris, and nomination as Master of the Mint of
France, are the steps by which he rapidly rose in his new career.
    With the fall of the second Empire the political and administrative
career of Dumas came to an abrupt termination.            The Senate had
ceased to exist, and in the stormy days which followed, the Municipal
Council had naturally changed its composition; and even in the Mint,
where his rich experience and his rare talent of organisation might
have been still of such use in the public service, the man who played
so conspicuous a part under the Imperial Government had to vacate
his place.
    Having thus withdrawn from his o<U+FB01>icial positions, Dumas found
himself at the age of seventy in the possession of otium cum dignitate ,
but he never allowed himself to enjoy it in any other than the Cice
ronian acceptation of the words. After his retirement from political
and municipal life Dumas once more exclusively belonged to science.
There was no chemical aspiration which he was not anxious to assist,
no problem in the domain of chemistry, physics, or physiology to the
solution of which he was not happy and proud to contribute, no
scienti<U+FB01>c movement of any kind to the furtherance of which he was
not willing to open the treasury of his matured experience or to lend
at least the prestige of his name. But he was never more happy than
 when, in furthering science, he was at the same time able to serve the
 material wants and to promote the well-being of his fellow-citizens.
    That to scienti<U+FB01>c services continued for upwards of half a century
 science should have accorded with unstinted hand a rich share even
 of her external marks of honour was but to be expected; no Academy,
 no learned Society but has deemed it an honour to inscribe the name
 of Dumas on its register. A member of the French Institute at the
 early age of thirty-two, he has in due time reaped the full harvest of
 distinctions in store for successful cultivators of science. He became
 a correspondent of the Berlin Academy of Science in 1834:, and a
 Foreign Associate of that body in 1880; he was elected a Foreign
 Member of the Royal Society of London in 1840.           He was an hono

                                   xxvii
rary member of the English, French, and German Chemical Societies.
These associations, the second of which originated in Dumas’ labora
tory, elected him as a matter of course immediately after their insti
tution.    In 1843 the Royal Society awarded to him the much-coveted
Copley Medal.      That he was the <U+FB01>rst to obtain the Faraday Medal in
the gift of the Chemical Society of London, has been already men
tioned. Dumas was a Knight of the Prussian Order pour le M'érite,
the highest scienti<U+FB01>c honour Germany can bestow, and it may fur
ther be added that he received the Grand Cross of the Legion of
Honour, and was a Knight of a goodly number of other Orders in
Christendom.
    1n the autumn of 1883 Dumas’ health, which up to that time had
been unimpaired, began to fail.     By the advice of his physicians he
passed   the  winter  in the south  of France.   He died at Cannes on
11th of April, 1884.                                        A. W. H.

Dumas’ life and labours, by Professor A. W. Hofmann, of which the

(“ Nature,” 1880, Feb.
    A  short account of the life of Dr. TODHUNTER, founded on personal
knowledge, and information derived from papers and letters and
notes communicated by his relations, has recently been published by
his intimate friend, Professor Mayor.      From this pamphlet we learn
that Dr. Todhunter was born in 1820, and that he was the second of
 four sons of a Congregationalist Minister at Rye.       We are also told
 that as a child he was unusually backward, and gave no promise of
 his future eminence. If this be correct, it is a fact from which many
 boys may draw some encouragement. Passing over his boyhood we
<U+FB01>nd him an assistant-master in a school at Peckham, and at the same
time attending the evening classes at University College, and among
others the lectures of De Morgan.     Here he seems to have come under
the fascination which so many of the pupils of that great teacher
experienced. We are told that his admiration for that mathematician
was unbounded.      Need we wonder that the in<U+FB02>uence of that teaching
is seen in so many of the books he afterwards wrote?         In 1839 he
matriculated in the University of      London, obtaining the exhibition
for mathematics, and in 1842 he carried oif the scholarship at B.A.
Finally in 1847 he gained the gold medal at M.A., which was then
the highest honour to be obtained in that University.      Having thus
acquired the means of coming to Cambridge he entered at St. John’s
College, and took his degree in 1848. That he would be Senior
Wrangler and take the <U+FB01>rst Smith’s Prize was never doubtful.
Coming up rather older than men usually do, and having brilliant
talents, he found himself so much in advance of his year that he was

                                    xxviii
 able to devote a great part of his attention to other than the usual
 studies.    He once told the writer of this notice how as an under
 graduate he read Electricity to <U+FB01>ll up his time, though the subject
 did not then enter into the Tripos Examination List.
    In the same year in which he took his degree he gained the
 Burney Prize. According to the regulations, this prize is to be
 awarded to a graduate of the University who is not of more than
three years’ standing from admission to his <U+FB01>rst degree, and who
 shall produce the best English Essay “ on some Moral or Metaphy
sical subject, on the Existence, Nature, and Attributes of God, or on
the Truth and Evidence of the Christian Religion.”        His essay was
                                  “
printed in 1849 under the title     The Doctrine of a Divine Providence
is inseparable from the belief in the existence of an absolutely
perfect Creator.”     These headings are mentioned here to show how
widely   he  was accustomed  to spread his studies.
   Soon after his degree he established himself in his college as a
mathematical tutor, and then-acquired         a great reputation for his
skill as a teacher.  Afterwards   when   new arrangements were made at
St. John's College he was appointed Principal Lecturer, and was
expected to devote his teaching powers chie<U+FB02>y to the service of his
college. Soon after this he vacated his fellowship by marriage, and
following the rules of the college he retired from his position at the
head of the staff of lecturers.     He continued, however, to lecture for
some years, but gradually he turned his attention more and more to
the work of writing books.         Finally he gave up all share in the
tuition of his college, and devoted himself to those labours by the
results of which he is best known.
   Dr. Todhunter also spent much of his time as an Examiner.          He
was Examiner for the University of London for the <U+FB01>ve years ending
1869.    He examined for the Indian Civil Service Commissioners more
than once.     He was Senior Moderator in 1865 and Senior Examiner
in the following year, but though asked several times to examine
again he always declined, declaring that the work was so onerous
that it took up too much of his time.        This is an opinion held by
many other distinguished mathematicians who have examined once.
At the same time this circumstance illustrates the care and patience
usually given to the preparation of examination papers.         He also
examined for the Smith’s Prize.       But the Mathematical Tripos did
not alone obtain his attention, he also examined for the Moral
Sciences Tripos in the three years 1863, 1864, and 1865.
   He was a member of many learned Societies. He became a Fellow
of the Royal Society in 1862, and served on the Council during the
years 1871—1873.      He was elected a member of the Mathematical
Society   of London  in  1865, the <U+FB01>rst year of its existence.   He was
also a member of the Royal Astronomical Society.

                                      xxix
   Some time after his marriage he was elected to be an Honorary
Fellow of his college.      This was a distinction which he evidently
prized  so much   that  he sometimes     placed this title by itself after his
name, joined solely to    the letters   M.A.  or F.R.S.' Later on in his life
he was chosen as an Elector to three University Professorships, viz.,
the Knightbridge Professorship of Moral Philosophy, the Plumian
Professorship of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy, and the
Professorship of Mental Philosophy and Logic. Lastly, when the
University of Cambridge established its new degree of Doctor of
Science, restricted to those who have made original contributions to
the advancement of science or learning, he was one of those whose
application was granted within the <U+FB01>rst few months.
   The great work of Dr. Todhunter’s life lies in the part he has
taken in the education of this generation.         There are few of us who
have not studied      some   of  his   books.   Many   have made their <U+FB01>rst
acquaintance with mathematics through his aid; and not their <U+FB01>rst
acquaintance only, for his books conduct the student through a
vast range of mathematical learning.          Writing to his wife in 1878,
when he was Examiner for the         Indian  Civil Service, he says: “ There
is a library of mathematical books provided by the Civil Service
Commissioners for the use of the Examiners.           It consists of fourteen
volumes, ten of which are by myself.                         I
                                               Thus you see am able to do
much of that labour which Matthew Arnold thipks distasteful, namely,
that of perusing your own books.”
   A detailed. account of the numerous educational books he has
written would be too long for so slight a sketch of his life as the
present.    A simple list of these books is a history of the labours of
his life, as the dates run on we see his time <U+FB01>lled up with correcting
one edition after another.
   In writing, his <U+FB01>rst care was to be accurate. He once told the
writer of this notice that, with the assistance of two of his pupils in
                                                    “
correcting the press, the <U+FB01>rst misprint in his Integral Calculus” did
not occur till past the seventieth page.        It might have been thought
that he would have stereotyped his elementary books, but this was not
done until many editions had been issued.          Though at pecuniary loss,
and with great labour, he yet preferred to correct edition after edition
in hopes of eliminating all errors.
   In constructing his books, he seems to have discovered that, for the
teaching of boys, novelties would be out of place. What was wanted
in any subject was a short and accurate account of the things then
known.      The object was to put the reader as quickly as possible in
possession of all the knowledge which was most likely to be useful to
 him afterwards.     Accordingly he gives in his books a clear statement
of the well-known principles of each subject, arranged in a logical
 order. Each step in the argument is explained at length in clear

                                      XXX
                                                      0
 English.    Nothing is assumed but what a reader should know. Every
 page makes it evident how thoroughly he was keeping in mind that
he was writing for beginners.
    Whatever his own ideas were, his books were certainly a great
success.     His “Euclid” and his “Elementary Algebra” have in
twenty years run through <U+FB01>fteen or sixteen editions.            They were
appreciated by the schoolmasters, and by those who had to teach
these subjects.      With their recommendations, the sale has grown
into something enormous.           His more advanced text-books being
addressed    to a more   limited circle of readers could not be expected
to run through so many editions; yet we <U+FB01>nd his “Diiferential
           ”                                “                  ”
Calculus      reaching its ninth and his Integral Calculus       a seventh
edition.
    His reputation in future time will undoubtedly rest on his histories,
for the fashion of elementary books will pass away, and a new
generation will like a new arrangement of old things.            The most
important of these are (1) “ A History of the progress of the Calculus
of Variations during the nineteenth century?’ 1861; (2) “A History
of the Mathematical Theory of Probability from the time of Pascal
to that of Laplace:” 1865; (3) “A History of the Mathematical
Theories of Attraction and the Figure of the Earth from the time of
                                 ”
Newton to that of Laplace:          1873.  The <U+FB01>rst of these is a continu
ation of Woodhouse’s history of the Calculus of Variations from
its origin until the close of the eighteenth century; and it has
been stated that it was his admiration for this work that led him to
write this history.
    These books appear to the writer of this notice to be of great
importance.      It is a great boon to the student to have a short and
clear account of what has been already done, and what remains to be
accomplished in any subject. Though the third of these histories
extends over two volumes of nearly <U+FB01>ve hundred pages each, yet
these are not too much for so great a subject.
    It is unnecessary to give a particular account of these histories,4as
they have now been some time before the public.         But we would call
the attention of those who have not yet read them to their extreme
interest. As we read one of them, it seems as if a new light were
thrown on the subject. The dif<U+FB01>culties of each investigator are put
before us; we see how the subject advances, each discoverer adding a
little, until step by step we arrive at our present state of knowledge.
We see here sketched out before us the gradual growth of those
modern methods which we now <U+FB01>nd so ready to our hands. Thus, in
one place, Dr. Todhunter points out the <U+FB01>rst appearance of those
confocal shells which play so important a part in modern works of
attraction.     These appear in a memoir of Maclaur-in’s, who introduces
them in a. remarkable manner without appearing to realise their

                                      xxxi
importance.      In another place, we <U+FB01>nd a sketch in eight pages of a
memoir of Legendre’s which Dr. Todhunter considers to be the
foundation of all that Laplace added in the theories of attraction and
the <U+FB01>gure of the earth to the works of Maclaurin and Clairaut.            As
we read the sketch, we see      the <U+FB01>rst beginning  of Laplace’s coef<U+FB01>cients
and a recognition of the importance of the potential.          This was the
commencement of a new era in mathematical physics. In a third
place, the history shows us how D’Alembert,             trying to <U+FB01>nd the
attraction of an ellipsoid, makes it depend on a single de<U+FB01>nite
integral.    This result, Dr. Todhunter reminds us, is the point at
which modern investigations have <U+FB01>nally arrived.           But D’Alembert,
                                                                         “ In
after effecting this, strangely rejects his result as inadmissible.
his process,” says Dr. Todhunter, “there is nothing wrong in prin
ciple, but he has omitted a bracket which renders his result slightly
inaccurate.     He gives some invalid argument against his method.
 Thus D’Alembert deliberately rejects one of the most important
formulae of the subject, which in fact quite supersedes a large part of
 his memoir. This is perhaps the strangest of all his strange mis
 takes.” A little further on in the history, we read how Laplace
 values and appropriates the treasure which D’Alembert deliberately
 threw away.
    In 1869, the subject prescribed for the Adams’ Prize was “A
 determination of the circumstances under which Discontinuity of
 any kind presents itself in the solution of a problem of Maximum
 or Minimum in the Calculus of Variations.”            The proposal of this
 subject-seems to have arisen from a controversy which had been
                                                  ”
 carried on in the “Philosophical Magazine          a few years previously.
 In this controversy Dr. Todhunter had taken part, and when the
 subject was proposed for the essay he was anxious that his own
 view should prevail.      This view is given in the opening sentences of
 his essay :—“ We shall <U+FB01>nd that, speaking generally, discontinuity is
 introduced by virtue of some restriction which we impose, either
 explicitly or implicitly, in the statement of the problems which we pro
 pose to solve.” This thesis he supports by considering in turn the usual
 applications of the calculus, and pointing out where he considers the
 discontinuities which occur to have been introduced into the con
 ditions of the problem.          This he successfully proves in many
 instances. In some cases, the want of a distinct test of what dis
 continuity is, somewhat obscures the argument.              His essay was
 rewarded with the prize. It is published under the title “ Researches
 in the Calculus of Variations.”
    In the midst of so busy a life, Dr. Todhunter could yet <U+FB01>nd time
 to write for others.        The second edition of Boole’s “Differential
             ”
 Equations      was published under his care; and, what is more, he
 undertook the labour of arranging and editing the supplementary

                                    xxxii
volume.      This task was undertaken from friendship to the late
Professor Boole. The dif<U+FB01>culty of preparing un<U+FB01>nished papers for
the press is obvious; and it is not surprising that, as he once men
tioned to the writer, it should have cost him some months of hard
work.
   Dr. Todhunter      has left a treatise on Elasticity, which was very
nearly    <U+FB01>nished.    The time and labour he spent over this work
injured his eyesight, and probably led to his <U+FB01>nal illness.          These
MSS. had been sent to Professor Cayley to report on; and we learn
from Professor Mayor’s pamphlet that the investigation shows that
they are of the same class as the history of the Theory of Attraction,
and seem fairly complete.
   Another reSult of the labours of his latter years is a treatise on
Arithmetic.      Such a work when perfected would have smoothed the
way   for the young beginner over many dif<U+FB01>culties. It is greatly to be
regretted   that  he did not undertake it sooner.
   In the summer of 1880 Dr. Todhunter <U+FB01>rst began to suffer from
his eyesight, and from that date he gradually and slowly became
weaker. But it was not until September, 1883, when he was at
Hunstanton, that the worst symptoms came on. He then partially
lost by paralysis the use of the right arm, and, though he afterwards
recovered from this, he was left much weaker.          In January of the
next year he had another attack, and on the 1st of March, 1884, he
died at his own residence in Cambridge, surrounded by his dearest
relatives. It was a <U+FB01>t ending to an honourable and respected life
spent in the advancement of that science which he loved so well.

   April,  1884.
