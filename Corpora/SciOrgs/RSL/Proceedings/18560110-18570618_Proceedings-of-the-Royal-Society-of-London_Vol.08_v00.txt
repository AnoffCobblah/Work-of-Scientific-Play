   When considered by itself, insolinic acid has but slight claims on
the attention of chemists; but when viewed in connexion with other
groups   of bodies, it acquires increased interest.                         Some years since,
Gerhardt pointed out that to the homologous series of monobasic
fatty acids C", H” O,, the lowest terms of which are formic and
acetic acids, there       runs       parallel           a    homologous      series of bibasic
acids, C,,2 H,,,_, 05, the simplest member of which is oxalic acid.
These two series of acids are connected by the closest ties, and very
conclusive experiments have demonstrated that the members                               of the
former may be easily converted into those of the latter; such is the
case  of the transformation              of butyric into succinic acid, effected by
M.   Dessaignes under the in<U+FB02>uence of oxidizing agents.

   The existence and the mode of formation                         of insolinic acid prove
that to the series of monobasic aromatic acids,                         C,,2 H,,2_8 04,  the
lowest   known term       of which is benzoic acid, there corresponds
likewise  a series   of bibasio acids,             C,,2 H,,2_,,_2 O8     =C,,2 H,,2_,0 08.
Of  this series few members are at present known, but the group of
aromatic acids is itself very imperfect                 and limited.        The two   series

   If we take   the carbon as the standard                  of comparison, it is evident
that the bibasic insolinic acid corresponds to the monobasic acid,
which stands between toluylic and cuminic acid. In addition to this
unknown acid, toluylic acid only is represented in the series of bibasic
acids.   There are, in fact, two bodies which may be regarded as
representatives    of toluylic acid, namely, phthalic and terephthalic
acids.   Benzoic and cuminic acid are not yet represented.

II.  “ On the Existence of Multiple Proportion in the quantities
      of heat, or equivalent alteration of internal space of bodies,
      caused by de<U+FB01>nite changes of state as produced by Che
      mical Combination          or otherwise.”        By Tnomss Woons,
      M.D.        Communicated        by Prof. S'r0KEs, Sec. R.S.           Re
      ceived November 28, 1855.
                                   (Abstract.)
    Gay-Lussac having        shown    that   the   combining    proportions    of
gases  and vapours are either equal in volume or some multiple of
each other,    and other       chemists,   particularly Playfair and Joule,
having   extended the same law to solids and liquids,              it is evident
that specific volume of its combining equivalent is characteristic of
matter.    But as every substance is composed of matter and space,
or of particles with     some distance between them, as is shown by ex
pansion and contraction,        whenever volume is altered there must be
either an addition     to or subtraction from the internal         space  of the
body.    This alteration of volume is evident in the             case  of bodies
expanding or contracting         by gain or loss of heat; but in chemical
combination,   where alteration      of internal   space must take place also
(as shown by change of temperature, and because specific volume
being characteristic of matter, this volume must change when the
matter changes, by a substitution of a mixture          of two kinds of matter
for one), in chemical combination, I say, this alteration of internal
space is not so plainly demonstrable.          Still, in the change of tempe
rature, we have not only an evidence, but a measure of the change
of state of combining bodies. For, the phenomena of heat being
produced by    a.  dual force acting equally in opposite directions, one
body cooling or contracting        as another becomes heated        or expands,
it may  be taken    for granted that whenever heat or expansion is found
in one body, the opposite change is occurring in some other.               Now,
regarding this proposition as true, it is intended to be proved from
the combinations      of oxygen that the internal      space  of  a substance is
lost and gained in multiple proportion,           in the de<U+FB01>nite changes of
state  of bodies, such     as in the condensation      of vapours into liquids,
and liquids into solids, and the reverse;        and also in chemical combi

                                      5
nations and decompositions;       and therefore that the space as well as
the matter     of which volume is composed can         be   only added to or
taken away in what is called its combining        equivalent.
    In  order to <U+FB01>nd whether the heat     of chemical combination, which
is taken as equivalent to the alteration of internal space, is equally
produced by the same substance uniting with others, or if not, if it
is given out in multiple proportion, oxygen is made to combine with
several other simple bodies, and the alteration      of temperature noted.
    The method of oxidizing these substances, the details of each pro
cess being given    in the paper, consisted in dissolving them in some
suitable menstruum,—for instance, in sulphuric acid, liquor of potass,
and nitric acid.      When the two former are used, water is decom
posed to oxidize the dissolved body;       in the last  case, the  nitric acid
is resolved into oxygen and binoxide      of nitrogen, the former of which
unites with the substance to be oxidized, the latter escaping.          Other
combinations     and decompositions     at the same time take place (as
detailed in the paper), and being taken into account (decompositions
absorbing    as  much heat    as is produced   by the combination of the
constituents),   the alteration  of temperature by the oxidation alone
is arrived at.              g
    In this  manner    eighteen different  metals were oxidized, 'but the
heat   of oxidation was obtained satisfactorily only with twelve.       Other
experimenters     (Favre and Silbermann and Andrews) have, with a
 different  object in view, found the heat of oxidation of fourteen
 other substances;     their conclusions   are added as being       from   un
 prejudiced sources, and the result of all the experiments is brought
 together in a table, in order to see whether the law of multiple pro
 portion exists. The numbers found by the different experimenters
 are all calculated to the same standard.          The unit of heat is the
 amount necessary to raise the temperature         of 1000 grains of water
 1° Fahr., and the quantity of the metal oxidized is an equivalent of
 each, oxygen =1.
     To <U+FB01>nd whether the law extends to change of state when no
 chemical combination     takes place, the amount      of heat given out by
 the condensation of an equivalent of steam, and by the solidi<U+FB01>cation
 of an equivalent of water, is given. The following is the table giving
 the thermal equivalents     of the several substances, the names of the
 experimenters,    and the ratio   of proportion.     It  is to be remarked,

                                                           6
that the condensation of steam being in multiple proportion with the
other thermal equivalents, the expansion of all other bodies into
vapour must be included;                      for    I   showed in the Philosophical Maga
zine for January 1852 (page 48), that all bodies expand into vapour
in some multiple of their atomic volumes, and their atomic volumes
being in ratio also, their expansion or gain of internal space in this
de<U+FB01>nite change must be in multiple proportion.

   N0te.—I proved in                 a     paper published in the Philosophical Maga
zine for October 1851, that                   “ the decomposition of compound

                                            7
produced.”       I believe I was the <U+FB01>rst to prove      this      as a general propo
sition, and, by so doing, laid the foundation          of almost all the thermo
chemical researches since carried           on; for,   as   far   as   I   am aware, no
process which took decomposition            into account was used before my
paper was published.
    In    a paper read to the British        Association at Belfast, and pub
lished in the Philosophical Magazine for November 1852,                        I proved
that the intensity of chemical ai<U+FB01>nity might be measured by the
quantity of heat produced by the combination.
  As regards the <U+FB01>rst of these papers, Mr. Joule published in the
Philosophical Magazine for June 1852, a memoir proving exactly
the same proposition, but giving me the merit of priority in a pre
liminary remark.    It        is,
                         however, singular that Favre and Silber
mann   bring forward in 1853 (Annales de Chimie et Physique,
vol. xxxvii. p. 507) the very same experiments to prove the same
fact, and give   it   as   their own.
   As regards the second paper.            In   six months after its publication,
Messrs. Favre and Silbermann (Annales de Chimie et Physique,
vol. xxxvii. p. 484) prove the same truth with the same experi
ments, using exactly the same metals, and give their memoir as
producing an original idea.
I     notice these coincidences here as being remarkable, and because
the propositions      contained    in the paper referred to are the ground
work of theppresent          experiments, and also with     view to prevent

       Anatomical   and Physiological Observations on the Organ
       of Vision, for the purpose of ascertaining the alterations
       caused by section of the Optic Nerve.”             By Anousrus
       WALLEB, M.D., F.R.S.           Part 1.    Received January 10,
       1856.
                                (Abstract.)
   The author begins by referring to experimental researches already
published by him on the effects produced on the nerves of living
animals by section at diiferent points in their course; and he brie<U+FB02>y
recapitulates the chief results  of these experiments,  as follows, viz.-—
l.  Section  of a spinal nerve on the distal side  of its ganglion is fol
lowed by degeneration     of the part of the nerve beyond the section,
whilst the part still connected with the ganglion retains its integrity.
2. Section of the posterior root of a spinal nerve induces no change
in the trunk or branches of the nerve beyond the ganglion, nor in
the portion   of the root which remains connected with the ganglion,
whereas the part of the root attached to the spinal cord, but discon
nected with the ganglion, becomes disorganized.           His conclusion
from these experiments, which have been varied in different ways, is
“that the spinal ganglion is the centre of the nutritive power of the
nerve-<U+FB01>bres adherent to    it."   From other experiments, he concluded
that the anterior spinal roots derive their nutritive in<U+FB02>uence from
the spinal cord;   and he has little doubt  “ that every nerve-<U+FB01>bre is in

                                      9
  connexion with a nerve-cell, which exerts over it a peculiar in<U+FB02>uence
 which enables it to retain its structure,” &c.        He  does  not think it
 proved, however, that all ganglia exert an in<U+FB02>uence both in a cen
 tral and peripheral direction like those of the posterior spinal roots,
 and indeed experiments have shown that certain ganglia, such as the
 superior cervical of the sympathetic,    exert their sustaining power on
 the nerve-<U+FB01>bres connected with them, in one direction only.
    The investigation    of the effects of section on the optic nerve,
 which forms the subject of the present communication,           promised to
yield interesting results on several grounds, and especially as calcu
lated to throw light on the relations of the <U+FB01>bres of the nerve to
those of the Opposite one in the optic chiasma or commissure, and
on the question as to the manner in which they are connected with
 the brain.
    After some observations on the structure        of the optic nerve, the
author describes     his experimental     procedure.     To  see   the nerve
whilst operating, and thus be assured that the section was effected
at the desired point, he began by dislocating         the eyeball forwards
from its socket, while the animal was under the in<U+FB02>uence of ether.
This operation he found could       be effected   in the rabbit, by simply
pressing   the eyelids widely apart, and was unattended with any
 serious  disturbance   of the functions    of the organ.       In  dogs the
 operation   is more   difficult, and occasions more injurious effects.
When the     eye is dislocated, its axis is  inclined downwards       and in
wards, and the optic nerve can be reached without dif<U+FB01>culty; so that
it may readily be cut at any desirable distance behind its place of
 entrance into the eyeball,     and may even by moderate traction          be
 broken off immediately before the chiasma.
    After stating various observations which he made on the dislocated
‘eye, the author   gives an account   of the effects which resulted from
 section of the optic nerve.      The condition of the retina after the
operation, was studied during the life of the animal by means of the
ophthalmoscope;      and, after death, its structure, as well as that of
the optic nerve before and behind the place of section, the chiasma,
the optic tracts,    and connected    part of the brain, was examined
with the microscope.
    The elements of the retina,   as well  as those  of Jacob’s membrane,
 were found unaltered four months       after the time    of section.    The

                                     10
distal part of the optic nerve (that left in connexion with the eye
ball), examined aftcr the lapse of a month in one case, and of two
months   in another, was also discovered to       be unaltered.    On the
other hand, the   part-of the nerve behind or on the central        side  of
the section was    invariably  disorganized.     The section was usually
performed on the optic nerve      of the right  eye, and the disorganized
<U+FB01>bres of its central segment could be traced back to the left optic
tract, through the chiasma, where they obviously         decussated with
the sound <U+FB01>bres    of the opposite nerve. The right optic tract had
undergone no change; the <U+FB01>bres of the left tract were disorganized
as far back as the quadrigeminate     bodies, except those running along
the posterior or inner border    of the tract; which exception appears
to the author to favour the opinion that <U+FB01>bres pass along the tracts
and commissures from the quadrigeminate bodies of one side to those
of the other side, without connecting themselves with the retina.
On the other hand, the results of his experiments do not          seem   to
him to countenance the notion of <U+FB01>bres running in the optic nerves
from one retina to the other without connexion with the brain, nor
the generally received doctrine that part      of the <U+FB01>bres of the optic
nerve are continuous with the optic tract of the same side; on the
contrary, the whole <U+FB01>bres of the nerve would seem to undergo decus
sation.
   The microscopic     characters   of the atrophied    and disorganized
nervous   substance are described in the paper; they were found to
differ somewhat in the part    of the nerve before and that behind the
chiasma, owing no doubt to the different structure of these parts in
the sound state.
   The changes produced in the geniculate and quadrigeminal bodies
will be communicated     in the succeeding part of the paper.
II. “ On    some  of the Metamorphoses of Naphthalamine.”               By
      A. W. Hormann, Ph.D., F.R.S. &c.                Received January
      10, 1856.
   The great facility with which some of the nitro-hydrocarbons can
be reduced by means of iron and acetic acid——the modi<U+FB01>cation of
Zinin’s process, lately proposed      by  M.   Béchamp—enables      us   to

                                       11
obtain the corresponding       bases  in larger quantity, and to examine
their derivatives more minutely.
   One of the   bases, for the preparation of which this process is par
ticularly applicable, is naphthalidine, or      as  it is more appropriately
called, naphthalamine.       Mr. William H. Perkin is engaged in exa
mining the deportment of this substance with chloride of cyanogen,
and the following is a summary           of the results he has at present
obtained.
   Fused naphthalamine,      when submitted to the action of chloride      of
cyanogen, absorbs this gas with great avidity, and is gradually con
verted into a dark resinous mass.          This is the hydrochlorate of a
new base, which has received the name of menaphthalamine, in con
sequence of the analogy of its origin with that of melaniline, derived
by  a similar process from aniline.                                    ,
   Menaphthalamine is separated from the hydrochlorate by potassa,
washed and repeatedly recrystallized       from alcohol.     It  contains

                    mine.       cyanogen.    menaphthalamine.
   Mr. Perkin has veri<U+FB01>ed this formula of menaphthalamine by the
analysis of the hydrochlorate and of the platinum salt, which
respectively contain
                          C4, H17 N3,   HCl   and
                          C42 H17  N5, H01,    PtCl,.
   Among the various metamorphoses which menaphthalamine un
dergoes under the in<U+FB02>uence of agents, the deportment of this sub
stance with cyanogen       has especially engaged the attention        of Mr.
                     '
Perkin.
   Menaphthalamine, like melaniline,           absorbs   two   equivalents of
cyanogen, and is converted into a, slightly crystalline 'bu<U+FB02>‘-coloured
substance, which retains feebly basic properties.
   The analysis of this body, which, from its composition, may be
termed dicymenaphthalamine,        has led to the formula
                    C46H17Ns = 04:        H11 N3   + Cy?

                                             12
   Dicymenaphthalamine              is insoluble   in water, moderately soluble in
alcohol and ether.            It dissolves readily in acids.       The latter solution,
when precipitated            by potassa, immediately       after it has been made,
yields   unchanged           dicymenaphthalamine;          but    if   the   solution  be
allowed to stand for a few moments, a yellow substance is precipi
tated, which is no longer a salt            of dicymenaphthalamine.
   The composition             of this yellow body, which, in accordance with
the terminology adopted in the aniline series, may be called menaph
thoximide,     is represented by the following formula

and its formation is illustrated           by the   equation---
       C46H17N +             41:10   + 2HCl =      C“  H15  N30        + SZNH4 Cl.

In fact, the mother-liquor of this substance contains a large amount
of ammonia.
   Menaphthoximide may be viewed as binoxalate of menaphthala
mine minus 4 equivalents of water-—
                      N3 HC2O4,

         Binoxalate of menaphthalamine.                      Menaphthoximide.
and this view is corroborated              by the deportment          of the substance
with potassa, which reproduces menaphthalamine                      and oxalic acid.
   From the preceding experiments, it is obvious that the deport
ment of naphthalamine with chloride of cyanogen is perfectly analo
gous to that         of aniline.       The subsequent metamorphoses                of the
newly-formed        compound also exhibit the same analogy.

         would give means of determining              the earth’: mean density       with
         accuracy, perhaps superior to that obtained in the Schehallien            or the
          Cavendish experiment; and which induced him <U+FB01>rst in the summer
         of 1826 (in concert with Dr. Whewell), and again in 1828 (with
         Dr. Whewell, Mr; Sheepshanks and others), to try the experiment in
         the Dolcoath mine near Camborne in Cornwall.             These attempts were
         both frustrated by accidents having no connexion with the essential
       ‘
         parts of the experiment.          After a lapse of many years, he found that
         several circumstances         (of which  one was the general   familiarity with
         the manipulation of the galvanic telegraph and the facility of applying
         it to the comparison of widely separated clocks) were very favourable
         to a repetition        of the experiment;    and having selected the Harton
          Colliery in the neighbourhood of South Shields             as a  <U+FB01>t place, in
         which two stations could be found in exactly the             same vertical   but
         at 1256 feet difference        of height, and being assured of every assist
         ance from the owners of the mine, he proceeded with the experi
          ments in the months of September and October             1854.
            The principal instruments            employed   were  two    detached    pen
         dulums      on iron stands, the property of the Royal Society, which
         were most carefully repaired by Mr. Simms; graduated arcs, baro
         meters, thermometers,           &c.;  two clocks,  one the property      of the
         Royal Society, which were <U+FB01>tted for this purpose                 with inclined
         gilded re<U+FB02>ectors upon the pendulum bobs, intended to be illuminated
         by the light of lamps passing through holes in the side of the clock
         cases; galvanometer-needles attached to the clock-cases, with circuit,
         breakers;      a galvanic     battery at the upper station; a journeyman
         clock at the upper station, <U+FB01>tted with an apparatus by which it
         completed the galvanic circuit at every 15' of its own time; and two
         galvanic wires passing down the mine-shaft             and forming a closed
         circuit through the battery,           the journeyman-clock,     and   the two
         galvanometers.
            The working party consisted of Mr. Dunkin (superintendent) and
         Mr. Ellis from the Royal Observatory, Mr. Pogson from the Obser
         vatory of Oxford,        Mr. Creswick from the Observatory of Cambridge,
         Mr. G. Riimker from the Observatory of Durham, and Mr. Sim
         monds from       Mr. Carrington’s Red Ilill Observatory.
            The plan of operations was this.            Simultaneous    observations   of
         the two pendulums           (one in the upper and the other in the lower

                                       _15    ‘*1’ d.»@_.'.4¢s      is.   <1.»    5

(day and night) of one week; then the pendulums were interchanged                                    [WU A
and were observed in the same manner through another week; after                                 _¥=!i~*-om}

one week.       Each pendulum          had six swings of nearly four hours
each,    on every day      of observation;       and between the end                  of one
swing and the beginning of the next, numerous galvanic signals were                                  /"Vi"
passed for the comparison          of the clocks.                                           -
     The second section gives the details (as far                       as space   permits)
of the comparisons of clocks by the galvanic signals.                        On examining
the proportion of rates,      it   was found that there was distinctly                a   per
soual equation      in the observation of the galvanic signals.                    Approxi
mate values for the different observers were obtained, and the pro
portion of rates was corrected (where necessary) for these equations.
  The third section describes the general system of observing the
pendulums       and reducing       the observations.              For ascertaining         the
time of    a   coincidence   of the vibration of the detached pendulum
with that of the clock pendulum,             the mean       of the times of the <U+FB01>rst
disappearance       and the last re-appearance            was employed.               Several
coincidences were observed at the beginning of                   a     swing and the mean
was taken: and several were observed, and the mean taken, at the
end     of the swing.      From these means,            a    mean interval          of coin
cidences was obtained; from which the ratio of the actual rate of
the detached pendulum to that of the clock pendulum was found.
 This requires several corrections.
   _The correction depending on the arc of
                                             vibration, with no data
 except the <U+FB01>rst and last arcs of vibration, and no assumption of                               a
 mathematical       law for the intermediate          arcs,       is   made to depend on
 the results   of experimental observations on the numerical                     decrease       of
 the are by    a   peculiar process.
     The corrections depending on the temperature and the atmospheric
 pressure are based mainly on Sabine’s experiments.

     The fourth section contains an abstract of the Pendulum Obser
 vations at the Upper Station, with the corrected logarithm                            of the
 rate of the detached pendulum             on the clock              pendulum      for every
 swing;     and the <U+FB01>fth section contains             a     similar abstract for the
 Lower Station.

                                            16
      The sixth section gives the computation              of the logarithm of the
   rate  of the lower detached pendulum upon the upper detached pen
   dulum (for which the preceding sections have furnished the ele
   ments). Then is given in detail the investigation, by the Theory of
   Probabilities, of the formula for the         best   combination      of the results
   of the d.i<U+FB01>'erent swings. The advantage of the method of incessant
   observations with numerous comparisons of the clocks is pointed out.
   The formula is applied to the four series of observations;                  and the
   results  of the <U+FB01>rst and third series agree very closely, and those of
   the second and fourth series         agree very closely, showing           that the
  pendulums      had undergone no sensible change.                 By comparing the
   mean    of the <U+FB01>rst and third series      with the mean of the second and
   fourth, the proportion of pendulum rates at the upper and lower
   stations is obtained independently            of the pendulums employed.
   The conclusion       is that gravity below is greater than gravity above
   by  1-9—}—nth  part, with an uncertainty        of  -F}-0-th  part of the excess;
   or that the acceleration of a seconds’ pendulum                below is 2"24 per
   day, with an uncertainty      of less than      0"0l.       Reasons however are
  given for believing that the uncertainty            is greater than this quan
  tity.
      The seventh section contains a description                of the operation for
  measuring the depth of the mine.              It then treats of the process to
  be employed      for computing      the proportion       of gravity at the upper
  and lower      stations (without      reference to the experiments),           on an
  assumed proportion of the density           of the mine-rocks to the earth's
  mean density.        It is shown that, supposing the upper surface of the
  ground about Harton to have the true spheroidal                    form, it is unne
  cessary to give any attention        to the irregularities       of the surface on
  distant parts    of the earth.     It  is also shown that there is no reason
  to doubt the correctness of the law           of  decrease     of the attraction of
  the earth’s nucleus as depending on the elevation of the station, un
'
  less there be some serious      irregularity in the arrangement or density
  of the matter immediately below Harton. Assuming this to be in~
  sensible, the theory of correction for the inequalities of ground in
  the neighbourhood        of Harton is then considered.            The elevation of
  the upper station is about 74 feet above high water; and as it ap-'
  pears from this that the depth of inequality can in no case amount
  to one-tenth    of the depth of the lower station, it is easily found that

                                                        17
    the excess         or defect of attraction            will   be computed         with sui<U+FB01>cient
    accuracy by supposing               the excess or defect             of matter to exist abso
    lutely at the surface; in which case the effect on the upper station
    is nothing, and that on the lower station is easily computed.   For
    depressions like that            of the    sea bounded(at least for the purposes of
    computation) by             a   straight line near the mine, but unlimited in the
    other direction,        a simple      formula is found.
       For the application of these theorems it was necessary to have
    a map giving the elevations of the ground at various points.  By
    instruction of the Mayor and Corporation of South Shields, the
    Corporation Surveyor,               Christopher Thompson, Esq., prepared such
    a map.        In    the use       of it,   was found convenient to adopt as unit
                                               it
    of linear measure the depth of the mine.                           A   line at the distance    of
    ten depths very nearly touches the cliffs                      of Tynemouth, of French
    man’s      Point, and of          some     points     further to the south-east.              The
    land generally   divided into squares whose sides are one depth each,
                          is
    and these are grouped as appears convenient for representing ap
'
    proximately the form of the ground by compartments each of uni                            a
    form elevation through its extent.                       The principal requirements are,
    besides taking account of the depression                       of the    sea beyond the ten
    depth line, to estimate the eifect of the curvature of the coast to
    wards the mouth of the Wear, to compute the e<U+FB01>'ect of the hollow
    of Jarrow          Slake,   and generally           to make proper         allowance for the
    absence of matter in the valley                     of the Tyne.        There are also some
    small elevations to be considered.                         The general result is, that the
    attraction of the regular shell of matter                    is    to be diminished by about
    -2-§—6th   part.
       Putting D for the mean density of the earth,                             (Z   for that of the

       The eighth section contains                of the strata passed
                                                    a   detailed account
    through in sinking the Harton shaft, and the speci<U+FB01>c gravities of
    many of the beds as determined by Professor W. H. Miller.     The
    result for the mean speci<U+FB01>c gravity                   is   2'50.     Substituting this in the
        VOL.    vnr.                                                                      c

vity of the earth is found to be 6'566.         Adverting to the    excess  of
this number above those given by the Schehallien             and the Torsion
rod experiments, the author remarks that it is very difficult to assign
the causes or the measures     of error in either of the experiments, but
expresses his belief that the result of the present experiment may
compete on at least equal terms with the others.

       ments of the Heart and Blood-vessels;            with an Account     of
        Observations obtained by the aid of that Instrument.”              By
        S. Sco'r'r AL1soN,    M.D., Licentiate of        the   Royal College
        of Physicians,   London.       Communicated by G. O. REES,
        M.D., F.R.S.      Received January 12, 1856.
   The sphygmoscope (<U+FB01>g.       1) consists  of a small chamber containing
spirits   of wine or other liquid, provided with         a  thin india-rubber
wall, where it is to be applied to the chest.          At  the opposite extre
mity the chamber communicates with a glass tube, which rises to some
height above the level of the chamber.             Liquid is supplied to the
instrument    until it stands in the tube    a  little above the level of the
 chamber.     The pressure of the column          of liquid in the tube acts
upon the elastic or yielding wall of india-rubber and causes it to pro
trude.     This protruding part or chest-piece is very readily affected
by external impulse; it yields to the slightest touch, and being
 pushed inwards, causes a displacement      of the liquid in the non-elastic
 chamber, and forces a portion of liquid up the tube.          The protruding
wall of india-rubber is driven inwards when it is brought in contact
 with that portion of the chest which is struck by the apex of the
heart, and a rise in the tube takes place.           When the heart retires,
 the india-rubber wall, affected by the pressure            of the column of
liquid in the tube, is pressed back, follows the chest, and permits
the liquid to descend.      The degree to which the india-rubber wall is
forced in by the apex of the heart is denoted by a corresponding
rise in the tube, and the amount of protrusion of the india-rubber

                                    19
wall which takes place when the heart retires is denoted by a corre
sponding fall in the tube.      The tube is supplied with a graduated
                                  Fig.  1.
                               Sphygmoscope.
scale to denote the rise and fall with exactitude.      The glass tube is
provided at the top with some contrivance, such as a brass screw
and collar, to prevent the egress of the liquid when the instrument
is not   in use, or a bulb with an ori<U+FB01>ce may be supplied.          When
employed, the glass   tube  is left open to permit of the passage of the
air to and fro.
    The sphygmoscope is mounted upon a stand.          The chamber and
tube are <U+FB01>tted to a horizontal arm, which is made to move up and
down so as to carry the instrument to the desired height.        The base
is so made as to secure the requisite immobility.
    The glass tube is a foot or more long, and the round bore is about
 the one-eighth   part of an inch.      If the bore be much larger, the
movement will be inconsiderable;       if  much less, capillary attraction
will interfere and prevent free motion.
   When the instrument is to be employed, mounted upon its stand,
it is placed upon a <U+FB01>rm table with the chamber projecting beyond it.
The person whose heart is to be examined is seated upon a <U+FB01>rm
chair, with his chest erect and free from motion.        The protruding
india-rubber wall of the chamber or chest-piece is delicately made to
touch the <U+FB01>fth intercostal space so as to receive the blow of the apex     -
                                                              c2

                                          20
of the heart.       The liquid in the tube is now observed to be in mo
tion. With persons in ordinary health, the liquid rises and falls
about an inch. This rise and fall, after taking place three or four
times,   is followed    by a much longer         rise and fall to the extent    of
three or four inches, due to the advancement and retirement                of the
 wall of the chest during the acts of respiration.              The shorter rise
 and fall are again repeated and are again followed by the longer rise
 and fall caused by the motions of the chest.            During the longer rise
and fall due to respiration, the beat and retreat of the heart are still to
be recognized      by brief interruptions     in the rise and fall of the liquid.
When difficulty is experienced in obtaining             the shock of the heart
su<U+FB01>iciently    strong to give an appreciable rise and fall, the examinee
should make       a moderate     expiration,    and then hold his breath      and
incline the chest somewhat forward.             When the action of the heart is
feebly felt at the praecordial region, it may be necessary to apply the
instrument    to the naked chest;        but this is not necessary in the great
majority of     cases, and    it will generally su<U+FB01>ice to make the shirt and
waistcoat <U+FB01>t tight to the skin.            In many trials the sphygmoscope
has succeeded      in indicating the movements of the heart through the
tightly buttoned coat. Thin persons are very favourable for exami
nation; on the other hand, the corpulent less readily affect the in
strument.
   The movements of the heart, though best indicated at the <U+FB01>fth
intercostal space, are to be denoted at other parts           of the chest, and
in some examples       of  disease   and of large and powerful heart, even in
the epigastric region.         The moving arm proves convenient in apply
ing the instrument        to these parts.      In many persons with no very
excited heart, it is sensibly acted on at the scapular and infra-dorsal
regions.
   By means of this instrument the observer can ascertain the fre
quency of the beats of the heart, but as this can be effected in most
cases  with accuracy at the radial artery, no particular advantage is
gained from it in respect to this point.
   The duration of the impulse of the heart upon the chest is well
measured by this instrument: the time occupied               by the rise, is the
time occupied by the impulse.             A  slow rise after a rapid rise shows
a slow beat after a rapid          one,  and vice versd,   a  slow fall after an
ordinary fall,    shows a slow retirement         after an ordinary one.      An

                                      21
intermittent pulse is marked by an imperfect           rise, followed   by an
ordinary fall, and then by a long rise. The rise is sometimes slower
than the fall, which is occasionally found to be abrupt.               This is
observed when the heart, by reason of its great size, and of the some
what bent back posture of the thorax, suddenly falls away from the
walls of the chest.
    The movements of the auricles under ordinary circumstances are
not indicated by the sphygmoscope, though when it is placed over
them,     the liquid in the tube is moved upwards           and downwards;
but    as   these movements     are synchronous       with   the  movements
upwards and downwards         of another instrument placed at the apex,
it may be inferred that the ventricle       is the cause of them all.       In
some examples     of greatly excited heart,  as in phthisis,  the instrument
has revealed movements which seemed          to proceed from the auricles;
but further observations     are required   to settle this point, as well as
the question     whether   the  movements     of the aorta, in      a state  of
excitement, communicate any in<U+FB02>uence to the instrument.
  ‘
    The instrument, placed upon the heart, indicates strokes of that
organ which are so feeble as to have no corresponding            pulse at the
wrist.
                                 '
    No pause whatever in the movement of the liquid has               been  at
any time observed when the sphygmoscope has been carefully placed
so as to receive the     full beat, and fall back with freedom.           This
would go to show that the heart, however slow, is in constant mo
tion,   and, contrary to the belief of many physiologists,          enjoys no
pause.      There is certainly   no pause in the descent       of the liquid,
which takes place when the _heart retires from the thoracic walls, in
the middle of which movement it has been said a very short pause
is to be observed in living animals having the heart exposed.
    The force with which the heart beats at the <U+FB01>fth intercostal
space may be ascertained by closing          the upper     extremity   of the
glass tube, and observing      the extent to which the enclosed air is
compressed.
    \Vhen the heart is excited, the liquid in the sphygmoscope rises and
falls more than usual; but the rise and fall of the excited enlarged
heart is much the      same   as the rise and    fall of the excited normal
organ.      For the most part the enlarged heart gives movements to
the instrument when placed upon the ribs and sternum, whilst the

                                              22
normally     sized heart affects more exclusively when it is placed upon
the <U+FB01>fth intercostal space.
    The sphygmoscope indicates with exactitude both the absolute and
the comparative in<U+FB02>uence upon the heart, of food, cordials, stimu
lants, and tonic medicines.              It  does  the same in respect to depress
ing causes, such       as hunger,      cold, and sedatives.
    With the aid of this instrument               the fact is demonstrated,        that
the action      of the heart may          be great when      the pulse is    small,—
that the heart         may    strike the instrument         with force     when      the
pulse     scarcely affects the        liquid of the hand-sphygmoscope.                 It
affords a    remarkable proof that the pulse is one thing and the heart’s
action another,        and teaches that the pulse is only an approximate
sign of the state of the heart.               It is found  also, that while cold at
the surface and extremities             may depress the pulse, the heart may
 remain little enfeebled, or even become excited,                and that warmth
 and friction applied        to the extremities       may cause an excited pulse
 without there being any accompanying increased force of the heart.
     The in<U+FB02>uence of respiration upon the action of the heart is mani
 fested, in some       degree, by the instrument placed over the region                of
 the heart.      If   the breath      be    stopped'after an ordinary expiration,
 the movement        of the liquid is       seen to be increased.     If a  very long
 and forcible     inspiration     be made        and the breath    then suspended,
 the movement is somewhat reduced; but when the respiration is again
 allowed to take its normal             course, the movement is seen to be in
 creased for a short time.
     The sphygmoscope          rises during the <U+FB01>rst sound        of the heart and
 falls at the second.
     The sphygmoscope          reduced (<U+FB01>g. 2), deprived        of its stand, having
 a level elastic     wall instead of protruding one, and having                a glass
 tube with an almost           capillary bore, forms        a  remarkably      delicate
 indicator of the pulse*.             It  is so delicate in its impressions that        it
    “‘ Since this instrument was contrived, the author has learned that a sphygmo
 meter
         of much the same construction was invented some twenty years ago by
 Mons. le Docteur llérrison, and that a memoir upon it was presented to the In
 stitute of France.    The liquid employed was mercury—too heavy to indicate feeble
 impulses, and the moveable      wall was of gold-beater's skin, which is inelastic.    It
 may be added, that    M. Magendie reported against the practical application of the
 invention.

is appreciably affected by the regurgitant wave in the       jugu-    Fi5-   2
lar veins, and by the wave in arteries greatly smaller than
the radial.     From its nicety in manifesting the beat of the
blood-wave,     it is very valuable, and is called the hand
sphygmoscope.
    By means of this hand instrument applied to the arteries,
a comparison is readily made between the time of the beat
of the heart and the rise of the arteries under the in<U+FB02>uence
of the blood-wave.       This instrument is much more delicate
than the <U+FB01>nger in such an inquiry.         The impressions made
upon the <U+FB01>ngers of two hands fail to be conveyed with suf
<U+FB01>cient nicety to the mind to tell with certainty the relative
time of the beat of the heart and arteries. Except in cases of
extreme    slowness, the    sensations obtained    from the two
hands impressed      at nearly the same time, do not admit       of
                                                                      H     d
a  distinct difference in respect to time being made out.       It  ,Phi;.[é,,;,,_
has been to this very defect that the erroneous idea, that            s°°P°'
the beat of the heart and the bent         of the pulse are synchronous,
or nearly   so, has owed its   origin and continuance.
   The hand-sphygmoscope,         placed upon the radial artery, shows a
rise  of the liquid while there is a fall in the sphygmoscope placed
over the heart.       As the liquid in the one instrument starts from
below, the liquid in the other starts from above, and as the liquid
in the one reaches the top of its ascent, the liquid in the other
reaches the bottom      of its descent, to renew their opposing course.
The movements in the two instruments at the         same instant are always
opposed, and the whole       time occupied in the movement        of one in
strument in one direction appears to be occupied         by the movement
of the other in the opposite direction.         The movements alternate
with   as much     apparent exactitude    as the  arms  of  a well-adjusted
balance.     When the lapse of time between the beat of the heart and
the pulse at the wrist was <U+FB01>rst observed, suspicion of disease of the
aorta was entertained,     but the     subsequent   examination    of many
persons proved      that this alternation was natural.     In  some   twenty
persons subjected     to examination,   the complete alternation    has been
made out without the shadow        of a doubt.   These persons were of all
ages above childhood, and had the pulse of different degrees of rapidity
from 60 to 100.

    Hand-sphygmoscopes          placed upon     the carotid,   the braehial, the
 radial,  the femoral,    and the dorsal artery       of the foot, rise at the
 same instant, and    fall at the   same   point of time.
    These facts prove the existence of two great laws not previously
 enunciated,—lst,       that the heart’s beat alternates with the pulse at
 the  wrist; 2ndly, that the pulse of arteries beyond the chest takes
place in all parts at the same          instant, and without any appreciable
interval.
    The pulse, it appears, occurs during the retirement             of the heart
from the thoracic walls, and the collapse or fall of the arteries takes
place during the impulse        of the heart.    During the rise in the hand
sphygmoscope       placed     over the arteries,   the second sound        of the
heart has been distinctly heard, and during the fall, the <U+FB01>rst, softer
and more prolonged sound has been easily distinguished.
    The horse has been subjected to examination, to learn the relative
time of the beat of the heart and arteries, but the respiratory             move
ments and the motions          of the animal have hitherto restricted the
                                                                                    '
application of the instruments.          However, it has been most distinctly
ascertained, by the hand placed upon the heart and upon the plantar
artery, that between the beat        of these parts there is a decided inter
val.     The slowness of the action of the heart in the horse renders
this experiment less open to error than in man.                 In these experi
ments upon the horse,       Mr. Mavor, the eminent veterinarian, gave his
valuable aid.
   The sphygmoscope          forms    a good    pneumoseope.       It   delicately
measures the rise and fall of the chest in respiration.               It likewise
declares the relative duration of inspiration and expiration,            and may
thus prove useful in the detection of incipient phthisis, and other
pulmonary     diseases.    When the liquid has attained its highest eleva
tion at the end    of inspiration, it immediately begins to fall; but when
it has reached the lowest point at the end of expiration, it remains
there some instants.      The ascent is slower than the descent.        After the
fall of  an ordinary expiration,      a forced expiration   gives a second fall.
   The sphygmoscope may           be employed     without  a stand and is     then
more portable      (<U+FB01>g.   3), but from the       want of a <U+FB01>xed       basis,   and
from the motion of the ribs on which it must rest, its manifesta
tions are less extensive and satisfactory.           It may be maintained        in
situ with an elastic band placed around the thorax.                  When      em

ribs, the elastic wall of the chamber should be
plain, and not protruding.
   The       hand-sphygmoscope                 is    an    exceedingly
delicate     instrument,       but requires great care and
nicety in its construction.               It    may be made by
taking about an inch and             a   half of      a gutta percha
tube, half an inch in diameter, slightly widening
one      extremity     of it to make                a chamber       large
enough to hold a small horse-bean, and fastening
with thread        a piece     of thin india-rubber, or of
Bourgeaud’s    india-rubber bandage, securely over
it for the elastic and moveable wall. The liquid is
now supplied, and the glass tube, with                         a very <U+FB01>ne
<U+FB02>at bore, say Tl<U+FB01>th of an inch, and provided with
a ring of india-rubber, obtained by cutting off a
small portion of a <U+FB01>ne india-rubber tube, for a
“washer,” is now inserted and the instrument is
ready for use.         The hand-sphygmoscope discovers
                        in              of the jugular

infant, though some months old,                      as   that organ rises and falls under
the in<U+FB02>uence       of its arteries.       There           is   no doubt that, applied         to the
fontanelles       before    delivery,    it    will inform the obstetrician                  whether
the     foetus   be dead or alive, and, in cases                   of di<U+FB02>icult labour, supply
important evidence for his guidance.
   The hand-sphygmoscope                 applied          to the radial artery, and to the
fontanelles      of
                 dying infant three months old, has indicated to the
                      a
author the in<U+FB02>uence of respiration upon the circulation. During
inspiration, the column of liquid in the tube was found to fall as                                if
sucked down, and during expiration to spring again.
   In      practical      surgery,   the hand-sphygmoscope                  may    possibly       be
employed with advantage, for               it       will rise with the wave or <U+FB02>uctuation
of liquid tumours. It may be placed where the <U+FB01>ngers cannot reach.
The rise in the instrument      greater in liquid than in aériform
                                           is
tumours on account of the compressibility of air, and the fall more                          is
rapid and decided when the contents of the tumour                           are   liquid.

    For the most part, the hand-sphygmoscope is best applied simply
with the aid of the <U+FB01>ngers.           It is delicately held between the tips of
the thumb, fore- and middle-<U+FB01>ngers,             the nails resting on the examinee.
The elastic wall is on no account to be pressed down with                    a dead
weight upon the vessel.          It is to be nicely lowered to the level      of the
artery when collapsed.          When the artery rises, it will strike the
elastic wall, and as the chamber              is <U+FB01>xed by the <U+FB01>ngers,     the entire
blow is communicated         to the liquid and it rises in the tube.        During
the retirement     or collapse of the artery, the elastic wall resumes its
level condition     and draws the liquid down the tube.               This motion
of the liquid allows the instrument to be employed though the open
end of the tube be dependent. When it is desired to avoid the varying
pressure experienced when the instrument is held between the <U+FB01>ngers,
some    such apparatus as was invented             by  Dr. E. S. Blundell, or an
elastic band suitably applied around the wrist, will be useful.
    The sphygmoscope is for several purposes renderedmore convenient
of application by interposing, between the chamber and the glass tube,
a piece of india-rubber tube of suitable bore and length.                   In this
way the comparison         of the beat of the heart and the pulse of an
artery is much facilitated, for the glass tubes of the two instruments
employed may be brought parallel                and close to each other, so that
the opposite motions of the liquids in the two tubes are,                  by near
contrast, rendered easier       of observation.        In employing this adapta
tion, care must of course be           taken that the india-rubber tube is of
the same calibre and length in both instruments.
    It is hoped that the sphygmoscope will aid in the acquisition                 of
additional   knowledge      of the movements and condition of the heart,
the situation   of which within        a case  of bone, wisely provided to secure
it from injury, has this disadvantage for the physiologist and phy
sician, that the action and condition            of the organ are with di<U+FB01>iculty
made out.       By means of the sphygmoscope, that small amount or
movement which is manifested at the exterior of the chest may be
rendered more appreciable to our senses, and more available for phy
siological  and curative purposes; and perhaps                information may be
obtained by this instrument which has hitherto been procurable                 only
by the practice of vivisection.

       and Edinb. &c.       Received January 15, 1856.
    MY DEAR Sra,—In a letter which I had the honour            to address to
 you last year “On the Ova of the Salmon in relation           to the distri
 bution of Species,”    I  have expressed the hope that some          of the
 results  of observations   therein described     may aid in solving     the
 question as to the period, the age, at which the impregnated         ova  of
 <U+FB01>sh are most retentive of life, and consequently are in the state best
 <U+FB01>tted for transport without loss of life.
    Joining with you in consideringthe subject in need of and deser
 ving further inquiry,   I have   taken the earliest opportunity that has
offered   of resuming it.    The experiments which      I  have made, and
which    I  shall now describe, have been more limited than         I  could
have wished, having been con<U+FB01>ned to the ova of the Charr, as           I was
not able to obtain the ova of the Salmon or any of its congeners in a
<U+FB01>t state for the trials required.
    The ova of the Charr which have        been the subject   of my experi
ments, were from living <U+FB01>sh brought to me from the river Brathay,
a tributary of Windcrmere, on the 9th of November.           They were ob
tained by the pressure of the hand on the abdomen of the females
underwater, and immediately after their expulsion a portion of liquid
milt, procured in the    same way from a male, was mixed         with them
for the purpose of impregnation.
   The ova thus treated, 654 in number, procured            from two <U+FB01>sh,

                                       28
were transferred,     after little more than an hour, to       a shallow glazed
earthenware pan,      of  a circular form, about     a foot in diameter,    with
out gravel, the water in which, afterwards, was changed daily once,
and once only.        The   vessel was kept     in a room of a temperature
<U+FB02>uctuating     from about 55° Fahr. when highest,          to about 40° when
lowest.     The water used was well-water         of considerable purity, and
before used it was allowed to acquire the temperature of the room.
    Two modes occurred to        me as  likely to afford the means of testing
the vital power     of the  ova, or  their power of endurance without loss
of vitality;    viz. one by subjecting them for a limited time to a tem
peraturc raised above the ordinary temperature;           the other, by having
them conveyed to a considerable distance.
    For the trials <U+FB01>rst proposed, the ova were put into a thin glass
vessel half-full of water, which was placed in a water-bath and heated
to the temperature desired.
    The <U+FB01>rst experiment was made on ova taken from the general stock
one day after their expulsion.         Six, for two hours, were exposed to
a temperature      varying from 79° to 80° of Fahr.             The result was,
that they became opaque in the course of twenty-four              hours, all but
one, and that, some days after, underwent the same change, denoting
loss of vitality.
    The second experiment        was made on the     l0th of November.        Six
ova were similarly exposed for two hours              to a temperature     rising
gradually    from 70° to 78°; the result was similar:          on the following
day they were all found opaque.
    The third experiment       was  made on the 11th of November.            The
 same   number     of eggs were    exposed for an hour to a temperature
 falling from 70° to 69°.        Two shortly became opaque; four retained
 their transparency      during a month, though in reality dead, which
was denoted by their hearing no marks of development when seen
under the microscope, those ova which retained their vitality being
 at that time    well advanced.
    The fourth experiment       was made on the    lat of December     ; the ova,
the same number, were exposed to a temperature              rising from 75° to
 78° for an hour and twenty-two           minutes.     Three became opaque,
other three retained their transparency and vitality, and in due time
were hatched, the <U+FB01>rst on the 31st         of December, the last on the 7th
of January.

                                       29
    The <U+FB01>fth experiment was made on the 13th of December.            Six ova
 were exposed for an hour and twenty-<U+FB01>ve          minutes to a temperature
 falling from 82°, which it was at the beginning, to 78°, which it was
 at the end.      Two became opaque; in these no marks of progress
could be    seen   of development, thus indicating that they were dead at
the time of trial.       Four remained transparent; in these, under the
 microscope, embryo-<U+FB01>sh        were seen with an active circulation   of the
blood-corpuscles.        One  of them was hatched on the 31st of Decem
ber; one, the last, on the 6th of January.
    The sixth experiment was made on the 20th of December, on six
ova, containing living embryos.        They were exposed for an hour and
twenty-eight minutes to       a temperature   of about 98°, and this during
the whole time.        When taken out, they had not lost their trans
parency, but in each the heart’s action was arrested, and death was
the result: they all sooner or later became opaque, from the common
cause, the imbibition of water.
    The seventh experiment was made on the 21st of December, on six
ova, in which the circulation was distinct in the foetal <U+FB01>sh.          After
an exposure      for an hour and <U+FB01>ve minutes to       a temperature   of  70°
rising to 82°, in <U+FB01>ve, on cooling, the circulation was found         active;
in one, stopped, which was dead; two were hatched on the 5th of
January; three, the remainder, on the 7th of the same month.
    The eighth experiment was made on the 23rd of December, on six
ova, each containing a living foetus.       They were exposed to     a tem
perature falling from 84° to 82° during an hour and twenty minutes.
Examined after the water had cooled, in one, the circulation was         seen
pretty distinct;     in two, very feeble; in three, the blood-‘corpuscles
appeared to be       stagnant.    Examined on the following day, the cir
culation was      seen  active in all.   One was hatched on the 5th of
January, the other <U+FB01>ve in the two following days.
    The ninth experiment was made on the 24th of December.          Six ova
were exposed for two hours and four minutes to a temperature falling
from 72° to 70°.        Examined    a quarter  of an hour after, and before
the water was cold, the circulation was found vigorous in all.           One
was hatched on the 2nd       of January, the remainder between the 5th
and 8th.
    The tenth experiment, and the last of its kind that           I have to
describe, was made on the 2nd of January.         Six ova, in each of which
                                                              n 2

                                       30
the circulation was distinct, were exposed for four hours to a tem
perature varying from 70° to 72°—the greater part of the time 72°.
Examined immediately on being taken out, the circulation was seen
uninterrupted in three, arrested in the other three.          In three-quarters
of an hour, when the water had cooled nearly to the temperature of
the room, 55°, the circulation was found to be renewed in the latter.
In   the interval, one of the former was hatched, and a vigorous            <U+FB01>sh
produced; on the following morning four more had come forth, and
in the one remaining        egg the foetal circulation   was  vigorous; it was
hatched on the 4th of January.
    I  beg now to pass to the other series       of experiments referred to,
those in which trial of the vitality of the ova was made by sending
them to a distance.          The method    was  brie<U+FB02>y the following.       The
ova were lightly packed in wet wool contained in a tin-plate box per
forated in its bottom to admit air, and covered with a wooden cover
that had    been soaked    in water, with the intent of preserving moisture.
The box was wrapped in tow, loosely covered with oiled paper, and
the whole, in an envelope of common writing-paper,             was well secured
 by a binding    of thread.      Thus prepared, the ova were sent by post
to Penzance, in Cornwall, a distance exceeding 500 miles, with the
request that they should be sent back by return of post unopened.
   The <U+FB01>rst experiment was made on the 9th of November. The number
 of ova sent was thirty, taken from the common stock without selec
tion.     They were received on their return on the 14th of the same
 month.      On taking them out, all were found transparent; but, with
 the exception     of one,   all became opaque on being put into water,
 and that one, after a few days, also underwent the same change.
    The second experiment       was made on the 14th    of November.    Twenty
 ova then     sent were returned     on the 18th.      All  became opaque on
being put into water.
    The third experiment was made on the lst of December.               Twenty
 ova then sent were returned on the 5th.               Put into water, eleven
 became opaque within a minute; most        of these were slightly shrivelled.
 After three hours, two more became opaque.           After forty-eight hours,
 four only remained transparent; in these, under the microscope, the
 circulation was found active in two; in the other two it could not be
 detected.     One was hatched on the 31st      of December, the other died
before hatching.

                                     31
    The fourth experiment       was made on      the  13th  of December.
Twenty-two ova then sent came back on the 17th.                 During the
interval there was    a severe frost; the thermometer here in the open
air was constantly below the freezing-point, and it would appear to
have been much the same throughout England.               When examined,
eleven   of the ova immediately became opaque on immersion in water.
In the other eleven there was no loss of transparency, and in these,
under the microscope, the circulation was found active.               Those
which had become opaque were placed in a pretty strong solution of
common      salt, by which their transparency     was restored,   the saline
 solution dissolving the coagulum.         Now examined,       no traces   of
 development could be detected under the microscope           in any one of
 them,—showing that they had been dead before they were sent
 away.
     On the following day, the 18th of December, the eleven transpa
 rent ova were repacked, and again sent the same distance.             They
 came back      on the 22nd;     they retained then their transparency;
 placed in water, a   feeble circulation was to be seen in two under the
 microscope; in nine the blood-corpuscles       had  ceased  to <U+FB02>ow;   these
 became opaque.      Of the two in which the circulation was perceptible,
 one was    hatched on the 28th of December; the young <U+FB01>sh in the
 other died, it would appear, in the act of breaking the membrane, its
  head, on the 29th, having been found protruding, but the heart’s
  action stopped.
     The <U+FB01>fth experiment was made on the 26th of December.               Ten
  ova, in which the circulation was active, and the foetus in each well
  advanced, were sent otf on the day mentioned,       and returned    on the
  31st.    The weather,    during the whole time, was mild, the frost
  having   ceased.   When opened, the ova were all found hatched, and
  the young <U+FB01>sh dead, as might have been expected.           When put into
  water, not one of them showed any signs       of remaining vitality; they
  were all examined under the microscope.
      The sixth and last experiment was made on the 6th of January.
   Six ova, in each of which the circulation was vigorous, were put into
   a glass tube  of one cubic inch and   a half capacity, with water to the
  height of about 1'4 cubic inch, the remaining space, after closure by
   a cork, being <U+FB01>lled with air.    The intention was to try the effects of
   conveyance to a distance on these ova in water with a small quantity

                                           32
    of air.   Owing to     a mistake,    they were not forwarded.       Examined
    on the following day, <U+FB01>ve ova were found hatched,             the young <U+FB01>sh
    dead;   in the   one ovum remaining       unhatched,    the fcetus was alive,
    the circulation active; on the 9th it burst its shell;         the young <U+FB01>sh
    was vigorous.
       As I could not with any certainty detennine, at the time the ex
    periments were commenced, what eggs were impregnated                and alive,
    and what were not,       I  had at the beginning     thirty ova taken indis
    criminately from the common stock, and put apart in a glass vessel,
    the water in which was also changed daily.           Of this number, seven
    were found in progress of development on the 14th           of December, or
    23 per cent.;     the rest had become opaque.         One of the seven was
    hatched on the 31st of December, the others in succession, the last
    on the 8th   of January.
       Further to arrive at     a proximate   average  of the proportion of im
   pregnated and unimpregnated          ova, or living and dead, on the 14th
   of December, when in the living ova the circulation was distinct
   under the microscope,          and the embryos     were visible even    to the
   unaided eye,    I  examined the whole number then remaining, viz. 405,
   thus reduced, owing to 67 having been            removed, one after another
   having become opaque, and 152 having been taken out for the pur
   pose  of experiments.       Of these 405 remaining,     138 were found alive,
   each containing      a well-formed    embryo, and 267, though still trans
   parent, without life, no marks of organization           being to be seen    in
   them, either with the naked eye or under the microscope.               Hence,
  irrespective   of the    152 experimented     on, the proportion of living to
   dead on the 14th       of December would appear to         be as 138 to   364,
   or about 25 per cent.        And, with the exception of two which died
  after the 14th, all those then alive were hatched,            the <U+FB01>rst on the
  31st of the same month, the last on the 9th           of January.
      What are the conclusions to be drawn from these results?              From
  those of the <U+FB01>rst series of experiments,         may it not be considered as
. proved that the power of resisting an undue increase           of temperature
  is possessed   in  a  higher degree by the ova in an advanced than in an
  early stage of development,—the           degree probably    being in the ratio
  of the age?      From those of the second series, is it not         as manifest
  that the power of bearing distant transport, and of retaining life in
  moist air, is in like degree increasing with age?             And from both,

                                        33
 may not the general conclusion be drawn, that the strength of vi
 tality of the impregnated ovum, or its power of resisting agencies
 unfavourable     to its life, gradually increases with age and the progress
 of  foetal development’!      And as the Charr is one of the most delicate
                       <U+FB01>shes to which it belongs, may it not further be
_of the family of
 inferred, with tolerable con<U+FB01>dence, that the ova of the other and
 more hardy species         of the Salmonidae, were they similarly experi
 mented upon,       would atford like results, con<U+FB01>rmatory of those ob
 tained last year in some trials on the ova of the Salmon, and men
 tioned in my former letter to you’!
     The practical application of these results, and of the conclusions
 deducible from them, is obvious, and need not at present be dwelt
 upon.

  II.   “ Note on a new Class of Alcohols.” By M. AUG. Canouns
          and A. W. I-lorMANN, Ph.D., F.R.S. &c.              Communicated
          by Dr. HOFMANN.          Received January 31, 1856.
     On submitting to dry distillation glycerine,       either alone or toge
  ther with bisulphate        of potassium or anhydrous      phosphoric acid,
  M.   Redtenbacher     obtained a remarkable     product, to which he gave
  the name of acroleine. Presenting all the characters of an aldehyde,
  and approximating more particularly to vinic aldehyde by the general
                                                               the in<U+FB02>uence of
  aspect of its reactions, this substance changes under
                                                                       formed,
  oxidizing bodies, especially of oxide of silver, an acid being
  named by this philosopher acrylic acid, an acid which stands in the
  same relation to acroleine as acetic acid does to aldehyde.
      The researches of      MM. Will   and Wertheim on the essential oils
  of mustard and of garlic, tended to indicate       a relation between these
  substances     on the one hand      and acroleine   and acrylic acid on the
  other, a result which was established        by the more recent investiga

                                              34
tions      of  MM. Berthelot       and De Luca.             On studying the action of
iodide      of phosphorus on glycerine,          these chemists obtained an           iodine
compound named by them iodide                   of propylene, which is          an analogue
of the chloride and bromide of propylene, previously produced by
 MM.        Cahours,    Reynolds,     and Hofmann, when submitting                     to the
 action      of chlorine and bromine the            gases     which are formed when
 either amylic alcohol or valeric acid and its homologues                       are exposed
 to the in<U+FB02>uence of heat.
     MM. Berthelot         and De Luca have further shown that the result
 of the mutual decomposition               of iodide of propylene               and sulpho
 cyanide of potassium is an oil identical with that obtained on distil
 ling the seeds of black mustard with water in an alembic.                           By this
 remarkable experiment it is most clearly demonstrated that the vola
 tile oil of mustard belongs to the propylene                     series, a relation    which
 had been previously pointed             out by Capt. Reynolds,               but which he
 has omitted to establish by experiment.                  If,  then, we admit the exist
 ence     of  a hydrocarbon,     C6 H5, analogous to ethyl,             C 4 H5,  we get
     C,  H5 Cl       Chloride of propylene.         C4 H5   Cl        Chloride of ethyl.
     C5 H5    Br     Bromide of propylene.          C4  H,  Br        Bromide of ethyl.

      All    that now remained was to discover the keystone of this edi<U+FB01>ce,
  in other words, to establish the existence of an alcohol to which the
  preceding compounds might be referred, and by the aid of which a
  still more numerous          series   of ethers, both simple and compound,
  and analogous in every respect to the derivatives of ordinary alcohol,
  might be obtained. After many protracted and unsuccessful attempts,
  we have succeeded in producing               the alcohol and ether of this series,
   for which we propose retaining the name of the acryl series.
       In order to arrive at this result, we have submitted several silver
   salts to the action of iodide       of acryl.       There      are  but few acids whose
   salts lend themselves          conveniently        to this reaction.          Among the
   various salts which we have examined with this view, the oxalate                          of
   silver has furnished       the most satisfactory results.                This salt is most
   violently attacked by iodide of acryl; the reaction is complete after

                                         35
two or three hours’ digestion.         The oxalate    of acryl    formed in this
process, when separated from the iodide of silver, washed with water,
dried over chloride of calcium, and redistilled,           presents itself as a
colourless transparent liquid, heavier than water, possessing a peculiar
aromatic odour.         It boils at 207°, and by analysis has been proved
to contain
                             Ce Ht 04: C2 (C6 H5) 04
   When treated with ammonia, oxalate of acryl furnishes oxamide
and the alcohol,        which was the object        of our researches.       This
alcohol—acr_1/lie       alcohol-—is   a colourless    transparent    liquid of  a
peculiar, somewhat pungent odour, resembling that of mustard, and
which in fact is more or less characteristic of nearly all the members
of the acryl series.
    The analysis of acrylic alcohol has led to the formula
                           C6 H6 O2=4 vol. of vapour.
     This compound is isomeric with acetone and with propyl-alde
 hyde, from which substances, however, it differs essentially by the
 aggregate     of its properties.
    Acrylic alcohol burns with         a  much more luminous <U+FB02>ame than
 ordinary alcohol.        It  mixes in all proportions   with water.      Treated
 with potassium, it disengages hydrogen and is converted into a trans
 parent gelatinous mass, which is the acryl-term corresponding to
potassium-alcohol.
     This potassium compound is violently attacked by iodide of acryl;
 a  precipitate of iodide of potassium is thrown down, and a liquid is
 formed     lighter than water, and insoluble in this <U+FB02>uid. This new
 substance corresponds to ordinary ether; its formation is illustrated
                                                    i
 by the following equation :—
                    C6 (H5  K)O2 + C6 H5    I=KI + C12 H10 02.
     The  same    product is formed by the action of iodide of acryl upon
  oxide of silver or of mercury.
     On treating the new potassium-alcohol         with iodide of ethyl, or the
  ethyl-potassium-alcohol with iodide of acryl, an aromatic              liquid is
  produced,     which is obviously the mixed ether            Q/' the   ethyl and
  acryl series.
     If acrylic    alcohol be distilled with chloride, bromide       or iodide  of

                                       36
  phosphorus,   the chloride,   bromide and iodide     of the acryl    series are
  reproduced with the greatest facility.
     Acrylic alcohol dissolves in concentrated sulphuric acid, without
  separation of carbon; the liquid, mixed with water and neutralized
 with carbonate of barium, furnishes a crystalline salt, which contains,
                    C6 H6  BaS, O8=BaSO4, (C6 H5) S04.
     This is the eulpkovinate of the series.
     On treating the mixture of acrylic alcohol            with concentrated
 sulphuric acid,    a most violent reaction     takes place; the alcohol        is
 entirely carbonized with evolution       of sulphurous acid.
    Anhydrous phosphoric acid         a<U+FB01>'ects  the alcohol with less energy.
 The mass darkens with evolution           of  a transparent   colourless    gas,
 burning with     a luminous    <U+FB02>ame.     The analysis of this     gas remains
 to be made.
    Acrylic alcohol is rapidly attacked by oxidizing agents. A mix
 ture of sulphuric acid and bichromate of potassium acts with tre
 mendous violence; the products of the reaction being acroleine              and
 acrylic acid, or its products    of decomposition.     The  same    transform
ation is effected by spongy platinum.
    When treated with potassa and bisulphide of carbon, the new alco
hol solidi<U+FB01>es at once into a mass of splendid yellow needles, which
correspond to xanthate of potassium.
    By the aid of the alcohol itself, its sulphovinic acid, or its iodide,
all the terms of the acryl series may be produced with the greatest
facility.     We will specify the following compounds, the study of
which     we have more or less completed.
    Acryl-oxamethane,     or oxamate       of acryl,  is readily formed       by
adding     alcoholic ammonia     in small quantities    to oxalate of acryl,
until   a permanent   precipitate is produced.      The <U+FB01>ltered solution     de
posits on evaporation the oxamate in magni<U+FB01>cent           crystals.
    Carbonate   of acryl  is an aromatic oily liquid, lighter than water.
It  is formed like the other carbonic ethers, by the action          of sodium
upon     the oxalate.    An alcoholic solution of this substance, when
treated with     baryta,   furnished    carbonate   of barium      and acrylic
alcohol.
    Benzoate   of acryl is readily produced by the action of chloride of
benzoyl upon acrylic alcohol.         It  is a liquid heavier     than water,

                                                      37
which boils at 220°, and                possesses         an aromatic odour, similar to that
of benzoic ether.               The       analysis         of this substance           leads   to     the
formula
                           C20 H10       04=C14 [H5 (Cs Hal] 04
   The       same    body is easily produced by the mutual reaction of iodide
of acryl and benzoate of silver.
   Acetate         of acryl,    obtained        by the action of iodide of acryl upon
acetate of silver, is a liquid lighter than water,                         of an odour resem
bling that of common                   acetic ether.              According to our analysis, it
contains
         ,                     010    He 04=C4 He (06 H5) 04
   Cyanate          of silver is most violently attacked by iodide of acryl,
even in the cold.    The heat generated during this reaction is so
powerful that the whole of the new product distils over. The sub
stance thus obtained has an incredibly penetrating odour, and causes
lacrymation in the highest                 degree.           The analysis of this colourless
transparent liquid, which boils at 82°, led to the formula
                                C_8   H5 NO2=C2 (C6 H5) N02.
   This      is   the cg/anate        of acryl.           Gently warmed with           a   solution   of
ammonia,          this liquid readily               dissolves,      and the      solution deposits
upon evaporation magni<U+FB01>cent crystals, which are nothing but acry
lic urea
                         C8   H8 N2 02         =     C2   H3 (06 H5) N2 02
corresponding         to thiosinnamine,              the long-known sulphur-urea term                 of
this series,

  Aniline produces with cyanate of acryl an analogous substance,
which crystallizes remarkably well.‘
   When treated with water, cyanate of acryl  gradually converted          is
intoa solid crystalline substance. The compound obtained in this
manner has the composition                     and all the properties                of sinapoline or
diacrylic urea.          Its formula           is

         The latter substance boils between 180° and 190°.                                                                                    All      our at

of which is acrylic alcohol.
   Like ordinary alcohol, this new alcohol furnishes                                                                             a series       of deriva

amount, and apparently              irregular occurrence, commonly called mag
netic storms, are found, when studied in their mean                                   effects, to be
governed by periodical laws of systematic                       order and regularity, and
to exhibit periods whose                duration      is,   respectively,       1,   a   solar    day;

corresponding        both in duration and in the epochs of maximum and
minimum variation, to the approximately decennial period discovered
by Schwabe in the phaenomena of the solar spots.     In the present
paper the author communicates the results of   similar investigationa
into the laws of the disturbances of the two other magnetic elements
atToront0, namely, the Inclination and the Total Force, derived from
the hourly observations of the horizontal and vertical Forces during
the <U+FB01>ve years from           July   1843 to   June 1848         ;   affording,        as he states,
a   full con<U+FB01>rmation     of the existence of periodical                 laws regulating the
disturbances of the Inclination and Total Force corresponding to
those which he had previously deduced from the disturbances of the
other magnetic Element, viz. the Declination.

    A                    of temperature has been remarked by
        very great depression
some observers when steam of high pressure issues from a small
ori<U+FB01>ce into the open air. After the experiments we have made on
the rush of air in similar circumstances, it could not be doubted that
a   great     elevation of temperature          of the issuing      steam might be
observed as well as the great depression usually supposed to be the
only result.          The method     to obtain     the    entire    thermal      e<U+FB02>‘ect   is
obviously      that which we have already employed in our experiments
on permanently          elastic <U+FB02>uids, viz. to transmit the steam through a
porous material and to ascertain its temperature               as   it enters into and
issues from the resisting          medium.        We have made            a   preliminary
experiment          of this kind which may be su<U+FB01>iciently interesting to
place on record before proceeding               to obtain   more exact numerical
results.
    A   short pipe an inch and   half diameter was screwed into an
                                       a
elbow pipe inserted into the top of a high pressure steam-boiler.   A
cotton plug placed in the short pipe had a <U+FB01>ne wire of platina passed
through       it,   the ends of which were connected with iron wires passing
away to       a     sensitive galvanometer.      The de<U+FB02>ection due to            a   given
difference of temperature of the same metallic junctions having been
previously ascertained,          we were able to estimate the difference                  of
temperature   of the steam at the opposite ends of the plug. The
result of several experiments showed that for each lb. of pressure by
which the steam on the pressure side exceeded that of the atmo

                                       42
 sphere on the exit side there was a cooling eifect          of 0'2 Cent.    The
 steam, therefore,    issued at a temperature           above  100° Cent., and,
 consequently,    dry; showing the correctness of the view which we
 brought forward some years ago * as to the non-scalding property of
 steam issuing from a high pressure boiler.

    A  comparison of the boiling-points of corresponding            chlorine and
 bromine compounds, led Prof. Kopp to the interesting discovery, that
 on the average their boiling-points rise       32°C for every equivalent of
 bromine which is substituted for an equivalent of chlorine.

   If  this difference   be constant   for all chlorine     and bromine com
pounds, it becomes obvious that very important inferences in respect
to the atomic constitution     of these substances may be derived from
the determination     of their boiling-points. This result has, in fact,
been happily applied      by Prof. Kopp,      as a  criterion to determine the
equivalent of silicium, a matter    of such uncertainty       as to have led  to
the admission    of not less than three formula for silica—
                                    SiO

and that of bromide          (l53° C.)—a difference which amounts              to
94   =3 X 3l%—Kopp derives the formulae
                                SiCl3 and SiBr3,
as representing       the atomic    constitution of the chloride and the
bromide of silicium, and he accordingly             <U+FB01>xes the     equivalent    of
silicium at 2l'3.
    In  order, however, to prove the general validity       of . Kopp’s obser
vations,    it was necessary to re-examine the boiling-points of cor
responding chlorine and bromine compounds               which exhibited      dis
crepancies, and to extend the inquiry to as great a number of new
                                                '
compounds       as possible.
    Mr. Francis Baldwin Duppa has, at my suggestion, undertaken an
investigation    of this subject, and has already obtainedasome valuable
results, which     I  beg to communicate to the Royal Society.
    The bromine-compound          of titanium was unknown.          Mr. Duppa
has produced this substance by passing a current of bromine over an
intimate mixture of pure titanic acid and carbon.                 The reaction
takes place at a bright red heat, and furnishes a brown liquid, which
 solidi<U+FB01>es in the receiver to a crystalline mass.          Distilled with an
 excess   of mercury, which removes any free bromine that may be
present, the bromide of titanium presents itself as an amber-yellow
 compound, exhibiting a magni<U+FB01>cent         crystalline structure   ; it attracts
 moisture with the greatest avidity, and is converted into titanic and
 hydrobromic acid.         Bromide of titanium has a speci<U+FB01>c gravity of
 2'6. The fusing-point was found, 39°. The boiling-point was
 examined by Mr. Duppa. with a considerable quantity of substance,
 the   purity    of which had been ascertained by analysis.             It was
 observed to be 230° C.         The boiling-point of the chloride of tita
 nium, as observed by Dumas, and con<U+FB01>rmed by            Mr. Duppa, is 135°.
 The di<U+FB01>'erence,     230- 135: 95:3       X 31%, is exactly the same as that
 observed     between    the boiling-points    of chloride   and bromide       of
 silicium.                                                                 i
     This observation furnishes an additional support to the analogy
 of   silicium and titanium, while it         points  unequivocally      to  the
 formulae

                                TiCl3 and TiBr3,

the number     at present adopted,       to 36'39.     The protoxide    of tita
nium    would in this     case become a sesquioxide, and the compound
hitherto viewed    as sesquioxide     would have to be considered as an in
termediate   oxide-as      a combination    of the sesquioxide with the ter
oxide, in fact, as a   bititanate of sesquioxide of titanium.

   It is scarcely necessary to observe, that an alteration     of the equiva
lent of titanium on the ground of the difference of the two boiling
points, would be hazardous, if not supported by additional experi
mental evidence, and that further researches on the series         of titanium
are required    in order to establish whether       the proposed    alteration
actually affords a simpler      expression for the combining      relations   of
this remarkable element.

      _cated by Lieutenant-Colonel Jamns, R.E., F.R.S. &c.,
       Superintendent of the Ordnance Survey.            Received Fe
       bruary 11, 1856.
                                (Abstract)
   Col. James begins by observing, that      as the Royal Society has,
from the very commencement of the Ordnance Survey of the United
Kingdom, taken a deep interest in its progress, be has great pleasure
in announcing     to the Society that all the computations   connected
with the Primary Triangulation, the measurement of the Arcs of
Meridians and the determination of the <U+FB01>gure and dimensions of the
earth are now completed, and that the account of all the operations
and calculations which have been undertaken      and executed is now in
the press, and will shortly be in the hands of the public.
    In the progress   of these operations it has been found, on deter
mining the most probable spheroid from all the astronomical and
geodetic amplitudes in Great Britain, that the plumb-line is consider
ably de<U+FB02>ected at several of the principal Trigonometrical Stations,
and at almost every station the cause of the de<U+FB02>ection is apparent in
the con<U+FB01>guration    of the surrounding country.
    The de<U+FB02>ection of the plumb-line at Arthur’s Seat is 5"'l, and at
 the Royal   Observatory    at Edinburgh   it amounts to 5”'63 to the
 South.    The unequal distribution of matter in the vicinity of these
 Stations-the great trough of the Firth of Forth being on the North
 and the range    of the Pentland Hills on the South—presents an
obvious cause   for the de<U+FB02>ection ; but as the contoured plans of the
 county  of Edinburgh have been published and the best attainable
 data acquired for estimating the amount of local attraction at the
 above-mentioned stations, it appeared desirable specially to investi
gate the matter, both on account of its scienti<U+FB01>c interest and with a
                                                         E 2

                                      46
view to con<U+FB01>rm the results arrived at from the previous investigation
of all the observed latitudes.        Col. James accordingly       decided on
having observations      taken with Airy’s   Zenith    Sector on the summit
of Arthur’s Seat, and at two other points near the meridian line on
the North and South of that mountain,         at about one-third of its alti
tude above the surrounding country.
   The observations were made by Serjeant-Major Steel of the Royal
Sappers and Miners, during the months of September and October
last, and 220 double observations of stars were taken at each Station.
The reductions and computations connected with these observations,
as  well  as the   computations    of the local attraction     at the Calton
Hill, were entrusted to Captain Clarke, R.E., by whom the account
now communicated of the mathematical investigation of the observed
data has been drawn up.
   Col. James has himself examined            the geological     structure    of
Arthur’s Seat and of the whole of the county of Edinburgh, and has
caused determinations to be made of the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of all the
different rocks, with the view     of estimating the mean speci<U+FB01>c gravity
of the whole mass; but he observes, that although the geological
structure   of Arthur’s Seat is well exposed, and its mean speci<U+FB01>c
gravity, 2'75, has been employed for deducing that of the earth,
viz. 5'1, still it is not a mountain     he should have selected for this
special object.     Accordingly he was pleased by       discovering——on      re
ferring, since these observations were made, to the correspondence of
the Survey,—that the late Dr. Macculloch had been employed from
1814 to 1819 in examining the whole of Scotland for the purpose               of
selecting a mountain       which, from its homogeneous        structure,   size,
and form, would be best suited for the purpose referred to, and that
he had pointed       out   the  Stack   Mountain     in Sutherlandshire       as
admirably    answering    the required   conditions.    The transfer of the
whole force    of the Survey from the North of England and Scotland
to Ireland, prevented      the_late General Colby from undertaking this
investigation; but as the Survey of Scotland is now in full progress,
Col. James purposes early in the spring to have the Stack Mountain
and the surrounding country surveyed and contoured,               and to have
observations taken for determining       the attraction of its mass, and he
trusts by the close of the present year to lay the results before the
Royal Society.

                                         47
    After these preliminary explanations,           a detailed account is given
of the mathematical        investigation,     and the paper, which was illus
trated with plans and geological -sections, and a model              of Arthur’s
Seat, concludes       with the following statement of the principal re
                                            '
sults  :—
    1.  “The effect of    _the attraction    of the Pentland Hills is observed
in nearly equal amount at each of the three stations on Arthur’s
                                                                               '
Seat.
    2.  “The     calculated  attractions   of the mass of Arthur’s         Seat at
the three stations are,—
           South Station.          Arthur’s Seat.           North Station.
          2"‘25 North.             0”'34 South.             l"'98 South.
                                               at Arthur-’s Seat is 5"'27, the
and,   since the observed de<U+FB02>ection
apparent effect of the Pentlands is 4"‘93 at the summit of the hill.
    3. “Of this     de<U+FB02>ection of 4" '93, the computed attraction due to the
con<U+FB01>guration      of the ground within      a radius   of <U+FB01>fteen miles accounts
for about 2'06; and, inasmuch           as we    know that the igneous rocks
of Arthur’s Seat and the Pentland Hills have an origin at a great
depth below the surface of the earth, the difference between the
 observed and computed         attraction     is probably owing in, part to the
                                                                                 '
 high speci<U+FB01>cgravity of the mass of rock beneath them.
    4.  “The de<U+FB02>ection at the Royal Observatory, Calton Hill, being
 5"'63 South, exceeds that at Arthur’s Seat by 0""/"0. Of this de
 <U+FB02>ection, 0"'60 is due to the con<U+FB01>guration of the ground comprised
 within  a  circle of a mile and a quarter round the Observatory.
    5. “ The latitude of Arthur’s Seat or points in the neighbourhood
 varies to the amount of 0"'02 between high and low water.
    6.  “ The mean density of the earth, determined from the observa
            i
 tions at the three stations on Arthur’s Seat, is 5'14, with           a probable
 error of      '07 due to the probable errors of the astronomical           ampli
 tudes.”

      Nascent    hydrogen,      acting    upon an alcoholic solution           of dinitro
  benzole or of nitraniline, produces a crimson                    coloration,  due to the
  formation     of  a new substance,           to which we have given the name
  nitrosophenyline.
      This new body presents some remarkable                       properties.    It fuses
  below 100° C.      ;   is uncrystallizable,        and not volatile without decom
   position; it dissolves in alcohol               with an orange-red tint, and an
.  alcoholic   solution     containing      only '2 per cent., although perfectly
  transparent     to transmitted       light, presents        a <U+FB02>ame-coloured    luminous
  opacity in re<U+FB02>ected light.              Nitrosophenyline dissolves in hydro
   chloric acid, producing an intense crimson colour, which is changed
  to a yellowish-brown by alkalies and is restored by acids.
      The analysis of nitrosophenyline              has led us to the formula

  experimented      upon, colouring matters similar to nitrosophenyline:

results were communicated to the Royal Society in April 1854 *, is pre
ceded byashort statementof the reasoning, foundedon incontrovertible

ordinary conclusion then announced,--that an electric current in an un
equally heated conductor,                if its   nominal direction be from hot to cold
through the metal, causes a cooling effect in iron, and                              a heating effect       in
copper,—the author describes new experiments which he has recently
made, and which are as decisive in leading to the same conclusion as
those by which he had <U+FB01>rst established                              it.     He also describes            ex
periments by which he had recently given an independent                                           demon
stration         that brass has the          same          property       as copper, and         platinum
the same quality as iron, with reference to electric convection                                  of heat      ;
results anticipated *, one as certain, and the other as highly probable,
from the previous results regarding electric convection in copper and
iron, and from the known thermo-electric relations between these
metals and the others.
      2. "l‘he phenomenon               of thermo-electric           inversion between metals,
discovered by Cumming, forms the subject                                  of the‘ second part.              A
mode        of experimenting            is described,            by which inversions              may be
readily detected when they exist between any two metals, and, when
thermometers            are available, the temperature                    of neutrality determined
with precision.               Various results of its application are mentioned, of
which some           are shown      in the following Table :—

    It was also found that Aluminium must be neutral to either P3, or
Brass,    or P2, at some temperature             between    —l4° C. and 38°        C.;
that Brass becomes neutral to Copper at              some  high temperature, pro
bably between 800° and l400°             ;  Copper to Silver, a little below the
melting-point      of silver; Nickel to Palladium, at          some   high tempera
ture, perhaps about a low red heat            ;  and P8 to impure mercury (that
had been       used for amalgamating          zinc plates), at a temperature be
tween — 10° and 0°.          Probably P3 becomes neutral to pure mercury
at  some    temperature below — 10° C.
    3.  In   the third part, e<U+FB02>'ects     of mechanical strain, and of magnet
ization on the thermo-electric           qualities of metals, are investigated.
The author had previously             communicated        to the Royal Society*
results he had obtained           regarding     the thermo-electric      qualities   of
copper and of iron wires under longitudinal stress, namely, that the
former exhibits a deviation towards bismuth,                and the latter towards
 antimony, from the same metal in an unstrained state.
    The only kind of stress applicable to              a solid  which has no direc
tional   attributes,    is uniform pressure or traction           in all directions.
 Hence it appeared probable to the author that a simple longitudinal
 stress would induce         different    thermo-electric     qualities  in different
 directions, in any homogeneous non-crystalline               metal subjected to    it.
 But he had found        (see Proceedings,       May 4, 1854) that the thermo
.electric effect of longitudinal traction on a wire, either of iron or of
 copper, is sensible to tests he could readily command,                 and more so
 in the    case   of the former than in that of the latter.             He therefore
 made experiments         to test the di<U+FB02>erence         of thermo-electric     quality
 in different     directions    in  a mass      of iron under stress, and fully
 established     the conclusion      that   the thermo-electric       quality across
 lines   of traction differs from           the   thermo-electric      quality along
 lines  of traction,     as bars   of bismuth differ from bars of antimony.
 The experiments he has already made nearly establish the conclusion
 that unstrained iron has intermediate thermo-electric quality between
  those of the two critical directions in iron under distorting stress.
     The experiments        of Magnus show that wires hardened by wire
  drawing have different thermo-electric           qualities lengthwise from wires
  of the  same substance softened by annealing.                The author has veri

<U+FB01>ed, that in copper, iron, and tin, simple traction,                   leaving permanent
elongation, leaves also a thermo-electric                effect, the same as Magnus
had found by wire-drawing,            which is        a composite application        of lon
gitudinal traction and lateral compression; and that in a variety of
metals, namely, iron, copper, brass, tin, platinum, permanent lateral
compression      (by hammering)            leaves     still the   same      thermo-electric
effect, as Magnus had found by wire-drawing.                           In    cadmium,        not
examined by Magnus, and lead, which had not a given result, the
experiments now adduced show a thermo-electric                     effect of hammering,
the same as in all the other metals except iron.                     Zinc wire was also
tested,   and found to exhibit the same                    eifect as copper,         though
Magnus had found            a reverse      quality     as due to wire-drawing.           The
discrepance     in this     case is    probably due to the peculiar                 effect    of
annealing on zinc wire, making             it brittle and crystalline, which might
give a di<U+FB02>'erent condition,           as the       “annealed” in Magnus’s experi
ment,     and the “unhammered”                    in the experiment          now adduced.
Setting aside this    case, the       author concludes that generally the effect
of permanent lateral compression is the                   same    as that     of permanent
longitudinal extension, or of hardening by wire-drawing, upon the
thermo-electric quality of a wire placed longitudinally in an electric
circuit; that in iron it is           a deviation        from the constrained metal
towards      bismuth, and that in all the other metals mentioned it is                         a
deviation towards antimony;                and that in copper and iron it is the
reverse of the e<U+FB01>'ect experienced by the same metal while under the
stress that caused the strain.               Since no kind        of strain, except uni
form condensation         or dilatation           in all directions,     is free from the
directional    attribute,    it appeared probable to the author that the
thermo-electric effects remaining in                  a metal    left with   a   longitudinal
strain,   retained   after the stress that caused it is removed, must be
                                He therefore experimented on iron
di<U+FB01>'erent in different directions.
hardened by longitudinal compression, and found that it deviates
from soft iron towards antimony, or in the contrary way to iron
hardened by longitudinal traction.                   From this, and from the results
quoted above,     it follows that in iron hardened by compression in one
direction,    the thermo-electric          qualities in this direction            differ from
those in lines perpendicular          to    it,   as antimony     differs from bismuth         ;
that the reverse statement applies to iron hardened by traction in one
direction; and that these differing thermo-electric quali<U+FB01>es have in

                                           5%
each case the thermo-electric       quality of soft iron intermediate between
                                         '
them.
    These various results show that the character           of the  e<U+FB01>'ect in each
case is decided by      distorting stress or by distortion, and leave entirely
open, and only to be answered by further experiments, the questions                :
what is the thermo-electric            effect of pressure or traction,     applied
uniformly in all directions           to a metal?    and what is the thermo
electric etfect of a permanent condensation or dilatation            remaining in
the metal, when freed from the force by which that condensation                  or
dilatation     was produced    ?
    Experiments      are also described, by     which the author found that
in soft iron under magnetic force, and in that retaining magnetism,
when removed from the magnetizing              force, directions   along the lines
 of magnetization deviate thermo-electrically          towards    antimony; and
 that directions perpendicularly across the lines of magnetization in
 soft iron, deviate towards bismuth, from the unmagnetized metal.
 He illustrates this conclusion by an experiment on a riband of iron,
 magnetized nearly at an angle of 45° to its length, and heated along
 one edge while the other is kept cool.              When the two ends, kept
 at the same temperature,          are put in communication        with the elec
 trodes     of  a galvanometer,     a   powerful current is indicated, in such
 a direction,    that  if pursued   along a rectangular     zigzag from edge to
 edge through the band, the course is always           from across to along the
 lines   of magnetization through the hot edge, and from along to across
 the lines of magnetization through the cold edge.
     4. In this part of the communication, attempts made by the author
 to <U+FB01>nd the effects       of various in<U+FB02>uences on electric conductivities         of
 metals     are described.       One    of these, with    a very    unsatisfactory
 method for testing resistances, led to the conclusion           that longitudinal
 magnetization      diminishes    the conducting     quality of iron wire.     The
  general plan for testing resistances, which he subsequently adopted
  as the best he could <U+FB01>nd,       and which has proved very satisfactory,         is
  next explained; and as an illustration, a single experiment on the
  relative effect of an equal longitudinal extension on the resistances           of
  iron and copper wires is described.           The conclusion established by
  this experiment is, that both by extension with the tractive force
  still in operation, and by permanent extension ietained after a cessa
  tion of stress, the conductivity of the substance is more diminished

                                      55
in iron than in copper      ; or else‘ that  it is more increased in copper
than in iron, or increased in copper while diminished in iron, if it is
not in each metal diminished, as the author is led by a partial in
vestigation of the absolute effect in each metal to believe.
   5. The result previously arrived at regarding        the effect of longi
tudinal magnetization on the conductivity of iron is con<U+FB01>rmed          ; and
an   experiment    that would have been found impracticable          by the
less satisfactory method, proves the same conclusion         for magnetized
steel wire, with the magnetizing     in<U+FB02>uence away.       Two very different
experiments show further, that the electric conductivity of magnetized
iron is greater across than along the lines of magnetization.         A  last
experiment,    showing   that iron gains in conducting power by mag
netization   across the lines   of the electric current, leads to the con
clusion   that there is  a  direction inclined obliquely to the lines of
magnetization,    along which the conductivity of magnetized iron
would remain unchanged on        a cessation   of the magnetizing force.

  I.  Supplement      to the   “Account of Pendulum Experiments
        undertaken in the Harton Colliery ;" being an Account of
        Experiments undertaken to determine the correction for the
        Temperature      of the Pendulum.          By G. B. Amy, Esq.,
        Astronomer Royal.         Received February 13, 1856.
                                 (Abstract.)
     Adverting to the circumstance       that, in the Harton Experiment,
 there was a mean difference     of 7° between the temperature      above and
 below, and that a careful      determination    of the coetlicient for tem
 perature-correction    was therefore necessary, the author describes the
 process by which the correction was now investigated by experiment
 on the same pendulums which were used in the Harton Experiment.
Two rooms were selected at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich,
having <U+FB01>rm stone <U+FB02>oors, and admitting of being heated, one by a
 stove in the room, the other by a hot-air-apparatus below.               One
pendulum was mounted upon its iron stand, with clock and other
apparatus, in one room, and the other in the other room.             Care was
taken that the pendulums        and their thermometers        should be effec
tually protected from radiation.         The two clocks were compared by
carrying   a chronometer    from one to the other, and remarking the time
of coincidence of beats;      a method    which admits of very great accu
racy, when     (as in this instance)     the distance     through which the
chronometer     is to be carried is small.    In  the  Fifth Series (counting
the series in sequence to those     of the Harton Experiment), Pendulum
 1821 was   kept in heat, and Pendulum        8 cool, and continuous   obser
vations were kept up during forty hours.          In  the Sixth Series, Pen
dulum    8  only was kept in heat, and observations were again kept
up during forty hours.       The Seventh and Eighth Series were similar,
respectively, to the    Fifth and Sixth.     The temperatures are referred
to two   of the thermometers used in the Harton Experiment, and to
two other thermometers supplying the place of two of the Harton
thermometers      which cannot be found.        The observations were con

                                        59
 ducted entirely by Messrs. Dunkin and           Ellis, Assistants of the Royal
 Observatory.
    On discussing the results of the observations, there appears to be
 reason for supposing     that    a change     hastaken place in one of the
 pendulums after the Seventh Series.            This appears from the circum
 stance that, though the    Fifth and Seventh Series agree well, the Sixth
 and  Eighth are discordant; and also from this circumstance, that the
 abstract relation between the two pendulums given by the Fifth,
 Sixth, and Seventh Series, agrees closely with that found at Harton                ;
 but   if the  Eighth Series is included, there is          a considerable      dis
 cordance.          _
    If  the  Eighth Series is rejected, it appears that Colonel Sabine’s
 coe<U+FB01>icient ought to be increased by about i<U+FB02>-th part; and on intro
 ducing this correction into the computations of the Harton Experi
ment,     the  result for the earth’s mean density is 61809.                If  the
Eighth Series is retained, the correction is reduced to less than one
fourth of that just mentioned,           and    the 'earth’s   mean     density   is
 6'623.
    The author subjoins an investigation             with which he has been
favoured     by Professor Stokes on the effect of the rotation and ellip
ticity of the earth in modifying the numerical results of the Harton
Experiment.       It appears   that the numbers found        in   the paper ought

           Received February 19, 1856.
     In    the preparation        of my course of lectures,         I   have found it neces
sary to re-investigate much of the above-named branch                          of mechanics,
and       I have        now a paper in preparation        on the subject, which          I   pro
pose to offer to the Royal Society when                       it is ready.    In   the mean
while, it appears to            me   that the two fundamental principles on which
my researches are based are of such                     a nature,       that they may very
properly be communicated                   to the Royal Society at once.               They are
as    follows       :
                           I. Principle of the Stability qf Earth.
     At    each point in a mass of earth the directions                      of greatest and
least compressive             stress are at right angles to each other;                and the
condition of stability            is,   that at each point the ratio of the diiference
of those stresses to their sum shall not exceed the sine of the angle
of natural slope of the earth.
               II.      Principle of the Transformation of Structures.
     Let       a    structure of   agiven uniform transverse section be stable
under      a       system of forces represented by given lines in the plane of
section :~—Then will any other structure whose transverse section                             is
a   projection  parallel lines of that of the <U+FB01>rst structure upon any
                         by
other plane, be stable under the system of forces represented by the
projections, upon the new plane, of the lines representing the <U+FB01>rst
system of forces.
                     Example     of the application of this principle.
     Let <U+FB01>g.       I     be an equilibrated    arch with its abutments          of the form
(for example) proposed by M. Yvon-Villarceaux, suited for hori                          a
zontal extrados EF. OK, OA, and AB being given, all the dimensions
of the arch and abutments are functions of those three quantities.
     It required to design an arch, <U+FB01>g.
          is                              for an extrados2,    at any              j,

   In  the abstract of   Dr. Woods’ paper printed in the Proceedings
for January 10th, the following remark occurs: “Mr. Joule published
in the Philosophical Magazine for June 1852, a memoir proving
exactly the same proposition, but giving me the merit of priority in
a preliminary remark.”        In justice  to myself   I  must state that my
actual   words   were—“I observe with pleasure that Dr. Woods has
recently arrived at one of the results of the paper, viz. ‘that the
decomposition     of  a compound    body occasions     as  much cold     as the
combination     of its elements originally produced heat,’ by the use
of an elegant experimental       process described      in this Magazine for
October 1851.       I ought,   however,   to remark,    that previous to the
year 1843    I  had demonstrated     ‘ that the heat rendered latent in the
electrolysis  of water is at the expense of the heat which would other
             been evolved in a free state       the circuit.’

French Academy in its ‘Comptes Rendus’              for Feb.    9,   1846,  and
according    to established   rule dates from that period.         I may   how
ever observe that the law he claims was published by me in the           Philo
sophical Magazine      for October 1841, where      I pointed    out that the
heat evolved by the combination        of oxygen and hydrogen is equal to
that due to the electrical intensity required to separate water into its
elements.      The   same   fact  was reiterated    in various      subsequent
papers,  in which it is also proved that “the quantities of heat which
are evolved by the combustion of the chemical equivalents of bodies
are proportional to the intensities of their a<U+FB02>initics for oxygen”
(Phil. Mag. xx. p. 111), a proposition which is given as his own by
Dr. Woods, and considered by him as “ an original idea.”

 I. " On    the presence     of <U+FB01>brils of soft tissue in the Dentinal
       Tubes.”     By JOHN Tomas, Esq., F.R.S.           Received Fe
       bruary 21, 1856.
                                (Abstract.)
    Referring to the structural characters of dentine, and to the pre
 vailing belief that the dentinal tubes in the normal condition contain
 <U+FB02>uid, the author goes on to show that the recognized histological
 characters fail to account for the high degree of sensibility exhibited
 by the dentine when diseased, or when suddenly        exposed by the
 removal   of the enamel.
    It is found, moreover, that the dentine is not uniformly sensitive
 throughout, but   possesses  a much higher degree of sensibility   at the
 peripheral distribution of the dentinal tubes than deeper in the sub
 stance  of the tooth; and it is urged that these facts cannot be
 accounted for by the presence of a <U+FB02>uid in the dentinal tubes, nor
 by supposing    that the hard unyielding dentine is intrinsically en
 dowed with sensation.     This view of the matter is borne out by the
fact, that all sensibility is at once lost if the pulp of the tooth be
 destroyed.
    Finding that the dentine owed its sensibility to the presence of
the dentinal pulp, and knowing that the tubes have open extremities
in contact with the pulp, the author was induced to examine care
fully the contents of the tubes. The investigation resulted in disco
vering that the dentinal tubes, instead of containing <U+FB02>uid only, give
passage to <U+FB01>brils    of soft tissue, which pass from the pulp into the
tubes where these open upon the surface of the pulp-cavity, and from
thence may be traced into the branches.      The <U+FB01>brils may   he demon
strated by fracturing a perfectly fresh tooth, and then with a sharp
knife taking very thin sections from the dentine near the         edge  of

                                          64
  the pulp-cavity.       The dentine will, when cut, break up into small
  fragments,    and from the        edges  of these the <U+FB01>brils may be seen
  extending.     Sometimes      a small portion of the pulp will be found
  adherent, in which case the <U+FB01>brils may be seen to extend from that
  tissue into the dentine.      The <U+FB01>brils may     be shown    in  a more   striking
  manner by decalcifying a section, and then, when it is placed upon a
  slide, tearing    the specimen across the direction         of the tubes.       By
  this manipulation, the <U+FB01>brils will be dragged out from one fragment,
  and will be seen projecting from the edge of the other.
      The <U+FB01>brils, when isolated and examined with           a  high power, with
  out the presence      of a reagent,   show some indications        of tubularity,
  but not with su<U+FB01>icient distinctness to enable the author to determine
  whether they are tubes or solid bodies.              Their appearance is very
  like that of the ultimate <U+FB01>brils of spinal nerves, and they possess a
  character in common with these, in the presence             of minute globules
  of  dense transparent     matter exuded from the broken ends, and some
  times from the surface       of the <U+FB01>bril.     It is not easy to determine in
  what    manner the <U+FB01>brils commence           in the pulp.       In  some prepa
  rations   they appear      to be connected      with cells    situated   a   short
  distance within the pulp, in others they may be traced to a greater
  depth, where they are lost in the tissue        of the pulp, and may possibly
  be connected with the nerves, which in this part are very abundant.
  But in the absence of exact knowledge as to the manner in which the
  dentinal <U+FB01>brils are related to the elements of the pulp, the author
  considers that there is sufficient evidence to warrant the conclusion
  that they are organs of sensation, the distribution of which through
  the substance    of the dentine endows that tissue with its sensibility.
I
      This conclusion is borne out by the occurrence of the following
  conditions.     If a fragment of enamel be broken from the surface of
  the dentine, the exposed portion of the latter tissue is highly sen
  sitive to the contact    of foreign bodies; but if the force producing the
  injury   be  sufficient  to rupture the nerves and vessels where they
  enter the root of the tooth,       the dentine loses its capability     of feeling
  pain.    Again,   if the dentine be exposed by the gradual wearing away
  of the enamel by mastication,         the surface evinces no sensibility,         a
  circumstance accounted for by the fact that the dentinal              tubes have
  become consolidated,      either at the surface exposed, or at some point
  between the surface and the pulp-cavity.              Diseased teeth furnish

                                            65
  further evidence in favour of the foregoing views.           If a carious tooth,
  in which the disease has advanced but slowly, and the carious por
  tion is dark in colour and tolerably <U+FB01>rm in consistence, be examined,
  it will  be found that the dentinal <U+FB01>brils have become calci<U+FB01>ed, and
  in a favourable section they may be           seen projecting from the edge of
  the specimen,        or lying broken in short lengths in the tubes.          On
  removing the diseased part of the tooth in such               a case, no pain is
  experienced until the instrument reaches the healthy dentine.               Sup
  posing, however, the disease to have been rapid in its progress, the
  carious tissue will be light in colour, and, as compared with the pre
  ceding example, soft in consistence.           The removal of the affected part   _
  in this    case is    frequently attended with considerable pain. Exami
  nation will then show that the dentinal <U+FB01>brils have not been conso
  lidated, but may be found here and there extending into the softened
  tissue without having suffered any appreciable alteration of appear
’
  ance.
      Daily experience shows that         a tooth may remain useful for a long
  time after the pulp, and consequently the dentinal <U+FB01>brils, have been
  destroyed.       If,  however, a tooth which has been so circumstanced         be
   examined,     it will be found that one of two actions has been         set up.
  Either additional cementum will have been developed upon the
   surface of the fang, or its bulk will have become diminished by
  absorption.       Similar conditions supervene when the crown of         a tooth
   has been lost by caries.                                                    I
      In  old persons we <U+FB01>nd the teeth are lost without apparent disease
  in the dental tissues. The teeth become loose and fall out, the roots
   being   in such      cases  translucent   like horn.     This condition is the
   result of consolidation        of the dentinal    <U+FB01>brils, and is followed     by
   absorption     of the cementum and dentine.            Cases may be found in
   which the whole of the fang has been absorbed, but reduction to
   two-thirds or half of the normal bulk is very common.
      The concurrence of the foregoing changes in the sensibility of the
   tooth, with the destruction or consolidation of the dentinal <U+FB01>brils,
   will, the author considers, justify the conclusion, that the dentinal
   <U+FB01>brils, in   a state   of integrity, are necessary to the normal condition
                                        '             ‘

     Professor Ehrenberg, in his descriptions of this class of animals,
assumed them to be in every case hermaphrodite.               His conclusions
remained       unchallenged    till 1848, when Mr. Brightwell discovered

                                          67
the separate      sexes  of Asplanclma Brigktwellii.       ’The author of this
memoir soon afterwards            discovered   a  second species of the same
genus     (A. priodonta) with a like diaecious character; and more
recently Dr. Leydig has added a third (A. Sieboldii), which does not
 differ in this respect from its congeners.
    Dr. Leydig plausibly conjectures that Enteroplea of Ehrenberg is
the male sexof H3/datina, that Notommata granularis is the male
 of N. Brachionus, and that Diglena granularis of Weisse is the male
 of D. Catelliua.
    The author of the present memoir has ascertained from his own
 observations     that the    sexes  are separate also in Braclzionus    Pala,
 B. rubens, B. amphiceros, B. angularis, B. Balceri, B. Dorcas,
B. Miilleri, Synchwta tremula, Polyartlzra plat;/ptera, Sacculus
viridis, and Melicerta ringens.         The males of these species, which are
here described in detail, differ so greatly from the females in form,
size, and structure,        that they could not have been supposed to
belong to the      same   genera, or even families, if their parentage had
not been distinctly determined.
    One    of the most remarkable         characters  of male Rotifera is the
absolute and universal atrophy of the digestive system.            No mastax,
jaws, oesophagus, stomach, or intestines occur in any example of
any species.       Another peculiarity is the great disparity between the
 sexes.     In every observed case the male is inferior in size and in
organization     to the female.
    The muscular system is well developed in the males of H3/datina,
Asplanc/ma, and Braclz. Miilleri.            The frontal cilia are in general
greatly developed in this sex, the result of which is seen in the
energy and rapidity       of its locomotion.       In most instances the great
occipital ganglion is distinct, with a red          eye seated onit;   and the
latter is almost always present, even where the ganglion cannot
be de<U+FB01>ned.        The lateral convoluted threads appear in Hydatina,
Aeplanchna, and Brach. dorcas           ;  and in Aspl. Brightivellii they are
accompanied by tremulous tags, and by a contractile bladder.
    Irregular masses of opake substance are almost constantly present
in male Rotifera.         This substance Dr. Leydig considers a urinary
concretion.
    In all  cases the   abdominal cavity is occupied by a capacious sperm
sac,   from which spermatozoa are forced out by pressure.            The out

                                                       68
let     of the sperm-sac is by                a    thick, protrusile, and retractile             penis.
In      those          species which possess a foot,                the intromittent organ           is
soldered to its dorsal side, and is often so greatly developed that the
foot itself appears                  as an appendage.             The penis is protruded by
eversion           ;    and is then seen to be a thick column with the extremity
tnmcate and ciliated.                     The sexual coitus has been witnessed by the
author in several instances.
      For      a       parallel to the curious         facts thus established,            the author
considers we must                      look to the Crustacea.             The Hectocotylua of
certain            Mollusca       is    scarcely      an    analogous     case;     nor    are    those
Entozoa in which the males are organically united to the females.
      In      the       Crustacea,      however,     of a sexual
                                                       many      examples    occur
difference which may be compared with that of the subjects of this
memoir.                 In   the genera Bopyrus, Phryxue, and Ione, the males are
notably smaller than the females, very diverse in form, and in some
respects inferior in structure.                       In   the Sipkonoatoma,        “the males are
extremely               small,   and do not in the least                resemble        the females”
(Baird) ; though those of different genera bear a strong resemblance
inter se, even where the females are very dissimilar. So low is their
grade of organization,                   that Burmeister has attempted to prove the
minute males to be embryonic                           forms.      Finally, in the Cirripedia,
Mr. Darwin has proved the existence of males in the genera Ibla and
Scalpellum, which are very minute as compared with their females,
excessively abnormal in form, and in some respects in an embryonic
condition,              though unquestionably              mature, as shown by their sperma
tozoa.          And, what is still more interesting,                     there    is,   in these male
Cirripedia,              “no vestige of           mouth, or masticatory organs,
                                                  a                                                  or
stomach.”                 The    same     observer describes the internal structure                  as
“   a   pulpy mass with numerous oil-globules                       ;”   and the sperm-vesicle
      “                                                             of the sack-formed animal
as        a   pear-shaped bag at the very bottom
containing either pulpy matter, or                         a   great mass of spermatozoa,”—
terms which might have been employed                               in describing         some    of the
male Brachioni.
      In all           these analogies,       the author <U+FB01>nds            additional reasons for
assigning to the Rotifera                 a   zoological rank among the Articulata.

I. “ Account of Experiments         on the Vagus and Spinal Accessory
       Nerves.” By Auovsrus WALLER,            M.D., F.R.S.         Received
       March 31, 1856.
                                 (Abstract.)
    The important functions      of the organs more or less completely
dependent for their innervation on the vagus nerve, have a<U+FB01>"orded the
reason   of so many attempts by previous physiologists to determine
the exact in<U+FB02>uence      exerted    by the <U+FB01>bres     arising from      different
sources which are intimately blended together in the trunk               of the
mixed vagus.     Since Sir Charles Bell’s discovery    of the different func
tions of the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal pairs, it has
become still more important to determine how far the same law holds
good with regard to the vagus nerve, and whether at its origin,             it is
 a purely sensory nerve, receiving its motor <U+FB01>bres from the internal
branch of the spinal accessory and perhaps from other sources.               Ac
 cording to Bischoif arid Longet, the vagus at its origin and     as far as the
 upper ganglion,    is purely sensory, and becomes possessed         of motor
 power from its junction with the internal branch      of the accessory, and
 from other branches derived from motor nerves (Longet).           The obser
 vations  of Bernard have led him on the contrary to adopt the opinion,
 that the vagus at its origin is  a mixed nerve  ; because after destroying
 the spinal accessory, no effect on the functions of the heart, stomach,
 or lungs was observed, and the only organs visibly dependent on the
 spinal accessory were the larynx and pharynx.           After bearingltesti
 mony to the correctness of the observations made by Bernard with
 regard to the effects immediately     following destruction of the spinal
 accessory, the author considered it desirable to apply to the determina

                                             70
   tion of this question his new means of investigation, in addition to
   those previously employed.             His <U+FB01>rst observations on the vagus,
   published in the ‘Comptes Rendus’ of the Academic                  des Sciences,
    1852, had already led him to entertain the idea, that the vagus proper
   was a purely sensory nerve.         They <U+FB01>rst consisted in cutting this nerve
   between     its upper    and lower      ganglia,   the section comprising the
   internal branch of the spinal accessory.             After the animal had been
   kept alive for a su<U+FB01>icient period to cause disorganization of the nerve
   <U+FB01>bres,    the   central  and    distal   portions    were   examined   microsco
  pically.      In the central portion, the <U+FB01>bres of the internal branch of
  the    spinal accessory included in the section were all in a sound
   state; some of the fascicles of origin of the vagus were also sound ;
   the   remaining     fascicles   of origin of the vagus consisted of dis
   organized <U+FB01>bres.       The analogy existing between the results as to the
  last-mentioned      <U+FB01>bres, and those which follow section of the sen
   sory   roots of the spinal nerves, led the author to the conclusion,
  that the disorganized        <U+FB01>bres of the fascicles      of the vagus were like
  wise sensory,      and had their trophic centre in its lower ganglion,
           the sound <U+FB01>bres probably had their trophic centre in the upper
. while
.
  ganglion.       On these grounds,       and some others a<U+FB01>brding concurrent
  testimony,      he concluded      that the vagus in itself was probably a
  purely sensory nerve.          In  the distal end, the part below the second
  ganglion consisted likewise        of a mixture of sound and altered <U+FB01>bres.
  When tested by galvanism on the living animal, it was found that
  the nerve had lost all power of exciting movement in the various
  organs which it supplies,         and that such branches        of         motor
  power     as the recurrent      and the crico-thyroid were disorganized         in
  their structure.       It  was
                                   evident’
                                              therefore   that the lower ganglion
  did not arrest the disorganization           of the motor <U+FB01>bres contained in
  the vagus, because, as has been proved by the author in other cases,
  when the disorganization         of the motor <U+FB01>bres of nerves distributed to
  muscles is arrested,-—as by the superior cervical ganglion of the
  sympathetic nerve, or by the effect of hybernation in the frog,—
  the motor power of these nerves is retained.
      In   the present observations,        the accessory nerve was divided at
  its origin by Bernard’s process of evulsion of its roots, and after the
  lapse of about a fortnight the vagus was tested by galvanism,                 and
  examined by the microscope,             in order to ascertain      the functions

                                      71
 which it had lost,     and the    <U+FB01>bres   which were disorganized,        the
 sound vagus on the opposite side being taken as a standard           of com
 parison.   On the sound side, galvanism of the vagus caused each time
 strong dilatation of the glottis by the retraction of the corresponding
arytenoid cartilage.     On the operated side, galvanism produced a
 slight movement of the glottis_on the      same side   by drawing inwards
 of the arytenoid.
    On the heart, the action of galvanism of the sound vagus was
 manifest by the stoppage of the pulsation of the carotid arteries
 and the diminution of their calibre.        On the operated side, no in
 <U+FB02>uence on the pulsation of the vessels was observed by galvanizing
 the vagus.    When the heart was exposed by removing a portion of
 the thorax, and keeping up arti<U+FB01>cial respiration, galvanism on the
sound vagus produced complete stoppage          of the heart’s action, while
on the opposite side, irritation of the vagus exerted no in<U+FB02>uence on
the heart.
    The stomach being exposed was found distended with food. Gal
vanism of the sound vagus caused evident contractions of this organ,
which were strongest     at the neck or constriction which         it usually
presents (in the   rabbit),-from whence they radiated in both direc
tions, becoming     more and more faint.        On stimulating the other
vagus, from which the accessory had been virtually eliminated;              no
perceptible  in<U+FB02>uence was observed.
    Microscopic examination     showed    that   the cervical  part of the
vagus   of the side operated      on   contained    numerous    disorganized
<U+FB01>bres, almost all collected together     in  a single fasciculus,  which in
cluded only a few normal <U+FB01>bres.        In  the recurrent branch were dis
organized   <U+FB01>bres, corresponding     very closely to those found in the
vagus above it.     Below the recurrent, the vagus and its cardiac, pul
monary and gastric branches consisted almost entirely of normal
<U+FB01>bres, most of which, as is well known, are nucleated <U+FB01>bres.
    From the foregoing observations, the author draws the conclusion,
that from the spinal accessory are derived the greater part of the
motor <U+FB01>bres contained in the vagus, which govern the movement of
the larynx, the heart, and the stomach.            He likewise infers from
the microscopic   examination   of the vagus below the recurrent, that
the motor <U+FB01>bres distributed to the heart and stomach belong almost
                                   ‘         ’
exclusively  to the nucleated or     Remak     <U+FB01>bres.

         Treas. R.S.        Received April 9, 1856.
    Of    the few attempts which have been made of late years to pre
pare drawings*, on a large scale,              of selected lunar mountains, this
 contribution from the Roman Observatory appears to be                    one  of the
 most successful.          It is on a scale of magnitude (about           10 geogra
 phical miles to one inch) such            as  only the larger modern telescopes
 can command, and characterized              by such <U+FB01>rmness of de<U+FB01>nition        as to
 do honour alike to the maker              of the instrument and to the artist
 engaged in the delineation.               It  may    assist those who      have not
 attempted,      with their own hands, any drawings of this kind, and
 desire to form a right judgement of the value of this work of
 P. Secchi, if      I  send for comparison a drawing of Gassendi, executed
from my object-glass            of 6%;  inches    (Cook), with   a focal   length   of
 11   feet.    The drawing is on         a scale  of 20 geographical   miles to an
inch, and Gassendi thus appears of half the linear dimension                        of
Copernicus,       being really almost of the same diameter.
    Placing together the two drawings, and remembering the appear
ance of Copernicus,          as  I have seen     it through telescopes, some       re
<U+FB02>ections arise which         it may    be permitted    me to express, in the hope
that we are now fairly entered on the long career of discoveries in
the moon,       to,   which the attention of astronomers has been of late
systematically        drawn by the      Earl of Rosse and      a Committee     of the
British Association.                               ’
    In proportion        as the power     of the telescope rises, the seemingly
simple      ‘ring mountains’ of the moon exhibit              as much diversity     of
outline and structure           as the larger terrestrial    volcanoes when accu
rately mapped.           Thus while Gassendi,—40° from the central meri
dian    of the moon, and 17° south1' of the equator,--has the obliquely
elliptical contour due to          a circle   in that position,    Copernicus,    20°

most conspicuous       peripheral crest formed of seven principal nearly
straight elements, approaching to equality in length, and meeting in
points which are situated almost exactly in a circle of 24 geographical
miles radius.       Here is   a very  important partial difference, coupled
 with   a very   important general agreement.
     While Gassendi, with peaks 9000 feet high, projects like a huge
 narrow wall into the Mare Humorum, and hangs over the interior
 plain in precipices    as steep and many times as      high   as those over the
 Atrio del Cavallo, Copernicus,      seated   in the midst of broad land, on
 a base   of  120 geographical    miles, rises in many broken stages, brist
 ling with   a thousand   silver-bright crests,-—a perfect network of rough
 and complicated ground, crossed by lights and shades, which have a
 history of their    own,——and    toward the inside falls off by many irre
  gular terraces, down to an interior plain,        as  if  the whole area had
  yielded, and the surface had been formed by enormous land-slips.
  Four sharp notches      are traced across the narrow ridge        of Gassendi
  cutting it deeply, like the hollows left by decomposing lava dykes
  500 feet broad; one deeper and broader opening unites the inner
  plain with the outer Mare Humorum, and one far wider opening
  leads to an accessory crater, over whose awful depth the cliffs,
   10,000   to.l 2,000 ft. high, spread black shadows round         some central
  rocks.    In  these particulars Copernicus     offers a very different aspect.
   Its high crest, of 10,000 feet, is only cut through by one straight
   narrow meridional groove, though broken by numerous <U+FB01>ssures in
   other parts, and is in all parts so irregular, partially undulated,       and
   varied with small crateriform     points, and enclosed areas, resembling
   craters, as to offer little analogy to any truncated        cone of eruption.
   The highest summit, on the left hand (west)           side-—-a huge  rock—is
   conspicuous by its broad, deep and extended shade.             What suggests
   a vast lava current,     is equally  remarkable     on the northern slope.
   Regarding now the central plains of these mountains, we remark in‘
   each several low ridges of rather sinuous forms, and several small
   mounds (half a mile or more across),         of which three central digi
    tated masses, not pierced by craters,         are the most elevated, and
    catch the earliest lights of morning which glance over the rocky
    borders  of the basin.      Had the drawings         been executed     at the

                                          75
instant  of sunrise on the central meridian line of the basin, these
points would have stood up on the soft edge of the light and shade,
as  bright  as the Swiss mountains          at sunrise or sunset, but not like
them reddened by the optical property of the atmosphere.                 Gassendi
has at least two     (I  have somewhere a memorandum             of more) small
craters within the central plain.         None such appear in this drawing of
Copernicus.       In  many other lunar mountains the centre is occupied
by a    crater-formed      hill,  as  Vesuvius      stands within Somma       ;   in
others the     hill remains     a smooth      rounded   mass, but its crater is
lost; and    a  further  stage   of decay    seems to be seen   in Gassendi and
 Copernicus,     where the central      mass    is broken into fragments and
sculptured     by rami<U+FB01>ed hollows.           May we ascribe these eifects to
the former action      of  a lunar atmosphere, now absorbed i.n the oxi
 dated crust of the moon?          If so, the lunar mountains have a history
of water, as well as records of <U+FB01>re, and we must look on the sinuous
ridges  of the Mare Humomm with eyes accustomed to the gravel
mounds of Norway and Ireland; study the degraded craters after
the models of the Eifel; and map the ‘rillen*’ with reference to
 valleys of erosion as well as of eruption.
    In questions of this kind we shall <U+FB01>nd such drawings as this of
the Roman astronomer             of priceless value.       Studied,   scrutinized,
 enriched with new discoveries,         it may be the model for all time to
 come in this line of research.            It  may be followed      by two other
 drawings   of the    same   mountain,——one        at the moment when the sun
 is on the meridian of the central hillocks, to show the light strea/cs,
 which hide themselves when the sun is low, and another in the
 clear afternoon     of the lunar day (as much after midday,               as   this
 drawing was taken before noon), when every little crack and cavity
 becomes again distinct, but greatly altered in aspect, and the whole
 landscape changes under the eye of the observer;              the plains grow
 ing grayer and softer, and revealing many minute low undulations;
 the hills looking more and more rugged, and burning with narrower,
 brighter and more angular tracts of silvery light.
         * I  have some curious results regarding these beautiful objects.

V. “Elementary Considerations on the subject of Rotatory
       Motion.”       By W. Gasvarr, Esq., F.R.S.               Communi
       cated by the Rev.J. B. READE,F.R.S.          Received March 12,
       1 856.
                                (Abstract
   The author explains the subject of rotatory motion in a series         of
propositions    by the use of prime and ultimate        ratios.   He com
mences with a simple problem, determining        the law   of the forces by
which    a particle  of matter is de<U+FB02>ected into any given course, and
pursues the inquiry by a consideration of the effect of these forces as
referred to a sphere, going on to the investigation of the character of
the motion    of any body enclosed within an imaginary sphere, such
sphere itself being supposed to revolve upon two axes inclined at any
angle to each other.      Hence the author determines the position of
some    point of the circumscribing sphere momentarily at rest, or in
other words, of the resultant axis, from which he insists that all
centrifugal forces must really   be calculated.
   His <U+FB01>rst application of the law thus enunciated is to the motion of
the peg-top; and upon the principles he has already laid down, he
shows that there is in the <U+FB01>rst instance rotation round a momentary
horizontal  axis, calling up rotation round a momentary vertical axis       ;

                                     77
and that the ratio of the velocities    of these two rotations, together
with the length of the peg, determines the angular inclination of the
top, contrary to the received explanation     as given  by Euler and other
                                                           -
mathematicians.
    The law is further applied to the effect produced upon a falling
body by the axial rotation of the earth, in the discussion of which,
La   Place, in the opinion  of the author, has committed two important
errors one in denying any deviation towards the equator, the other           ;
in his calculation of the amount of the deviation towards the east.
    This is followed by an investigation of the motion or direction of
<U+FB02>ight of a cannon-ball or shell <U+FB01>red in a northerly or southerly
 direction, from which it appears that    a large shell  will be subject to
 a deviation    from the true line of projection, in consequence of the
 earth’s rotation, amounting to no less than 22 feet.
    The author then refers to the well-known experiment of          M. Fou
 cault for proving sensibly the rotation of the earth, and shows from
 calculation that the errors which would be su<U+FB01>icient to vitiate the
 results in this experiment are   so extremely minute and so     difficult of
 avoidance by any perfection    of manipulation which can be employed,
 that its performance    cannot perhaps    be  safely adduced   as  proving
 such rotation.
    The author illustrated his views by the exhibition to the meeting
 of a model apparatus, in which the vertical and horizontal motions
 may   be variously  combined,   but which could not be intelligibly      de
 scribed without a series of complicated        drawings  un<U+FB01>tted for the
 compass    of a mere abstract.

  I. “  On the Condition of the Oxygen absorbed           into the Blood
        during   Respiration.”        By GEORGE HARLEY, M.D.,
        Teacher of Practical Physiology and Histology in Uni
        versity College, London.         Communicated by Professor
        SHARPEY,    M.D.,   Sec.  R.S.    Received March 16, 1856.
                                 (Abstract.)
     The author commences by explaining,         that his researches were
 instituted with the view of ascertaining whether the doctrine main
 tained by Magnus in regard to the gases interchanged in the lungs
 during respiration were correct—-namely, that the gases in question
 enter into no chemical      combination   with the constituents   of the
 blood, either in passing to or from the tissues and organs of the
 body, but form merely a physical mixture with the circulating liquid.
 The principal object of the inquiry was to determine the following
 points :—
     1. Has blood the property of chemically combining with the re
spired oxygen’!
    2.  Which of the constituents of the blood enter into combination
with oxygen?
    3. Do   these ‘constituents,   by combining     with oxygen,  simply
become oxidized, or do they also yield carbonic acid gas’!
    4. What are the agents which control these changes’!
    After describing the method of investigation, and the apparatus
employed, the author proceeds to relate a few of the analyses which
he considered as the most conclusive.         Instead of con<U+FB01>rming the
view of Magnus, that gases enter into no chemical combination with

                                             79
blood, his results led him to conclusions                of an opposite character,
which serve to con<U+FB01>rm the more generally received doctrine.
    In one set of experiments _a certain quaintity of fresh ox-blood
was <U+FB01>rst shaken with renewed portions                  of air until it had become
thoroughly saturated with oxygen, then introduced into a graduated
glass vessel with 100 per cent. of ordinary air, corked‘ carefully up,
and kept during twenty-four hours                 in   a  room    of moderate tem
perature.    In  order to favour the mutual action of the air and blood,
the vessel was frequently agitated.              At  the expiration    of twenty-four
hours the gas was analysed               by Bunsen’s     method.      In    an example
cited the following was found to be its composition                :—
            Oxygen.. .. .. ..        ..   10'-12
                                                  total oxygen. . 154        7
            Carbonic acid        . . . .   5'05
            Nitrogen     .. ..   . . .. 84-53
                                       10000
     On comparing this with the composition of the common air
 (oxygen 20'96; carbonic acid 00'O02 ; nitrogen 79038) which had
been introduced      into the vessel, it is          seen  that 1054 per cent. of
 oxygen    has disappeared, while 5'05 per cent.              of carbonic acid now
 exists, where only a trace          of its presence could before be detected.
     Similar results were obtained with de<U+FB01>brinated blood.                     In a case
 where de<U+FB01>brinated arterial blood from a calf, after complete satura
 tion with oxygen, was kept in contact with an equal volume of air
 during twenty-four hours, and treated exactly                as in the previous ex
 ample, the gas on analysis yielded in 100 parts,
             Oxygen  . . . . . . . .  .. l1'33                       _

                                                                            29

                                         l00'00
 showing in this     case also that the air           which had     been      imprisoned
 during twenty-four       hours      along with blood, no longer possessed its
 original composition,        but that some of its constituents had been
 materially increased, while others had diminished in               a manner no less
 marked.
     It would  appear from these examples that the blood had probably
 become oxidized in two ways; <U+FB01>rst, by giving off a quantity                       of car

                                           80
bon, and secondly by directly combining               with oxygen.     As to the
portion of oxygen which has disappeared, and which is not accounted
for by the carbonic acid evolved, it may have combined partly with
another    portion of carbon, to form a limited amount of carbonic
acid, which by the law of absorption is retained in the blood; and
partly with hydrogen           or some other oxidable        constituent  of the
blood, without yielding a gaseous product.
    These   two experiments         it will  be observed   point to exactly the
same conclusions,    and together with a number            of others, where the
mode    of procedure was similar, and which were attended with similar
results, have satis<U+FB01>ed the author as to the fallacy of Magnus’s doc
trine,  “ that the oxygen received during respiration into the blood
is kept there merely by the law of mechanical absorption, and enters
into no chemical combination with that liquid.”               Had this assertion
been well-founded,     such a change as has been seen to occur, in the
composition     of the air enclosed along with blood, saturated           as the
blood already was with oxygen, could not have happened.
    After having ascertained that air underwent              certain  changes  in
composition     during its contact with blood, it next became an object
to discover by which        of the constituents of the blood these changes
were induced.      With this view the author successively subjected the
organic compounds of the blood separately to the action of air, by
a similar process to that adopted in the case of the blood itself.
    A  certain quantity of fresh <U+FB01>brin, moistened with water, was satu
rated with oxygen, placed in a receiver along with eight volumes               of
air,   and kept during twenty-four hours             at a temperature    of from
 20° to 25° cent.     At   the expiration      of this time the  gas on analysis
 was found to have the following composition :—
             Oxygen . . . . . . . . . .  6'81
                                                 total oxygen  ' 1798
             Carbonic acid      . . . . ll'l7
             Nitrogen   . . . . . . . . 8202
                                      10000
 thus showing that <U+FB01>brin takes up a certain quantity             of oxygen, and
 gives off a stated amount of carbon            combined with oxygen in form
 of carbonic acid gas.
    The next experiments were made upon albumen, but                 as that sub
 stance could not be obtained            in a pure, and at the same time un

                                         81
coagulated   state from    blood,       the albumen            of the hen’s egg was
employed, which possesses         very similar characters.                 It   was found
that when   a certain quantity of the white of the hen’s egg was well
saturated with oxygen, and afterwards kept in contact with an equal
volume   of air during  a certain number              of hours at       a temperature   of
36° cent., the gas on analysis gave in 100 parts,—
                Oxygen   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   17'05
                Carbonic acid .     . . . . . . . . .     . . . .    2'09
                Nitrogen     . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   80'86
                                                                100'00
proving,  in common with the experiments                      on the blood and on
<U+FB01>brin, that albumen also    possesses        the property          of absorbing oxygen
and disengaging carbonic acid.
   Some comparative    experiments were also made upon serum and
upon blood-coagulum,     in which it was found that the air con<U+FB01>ned
along with the serum yielded on analysis
                Oxygen . . . . .    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   16-74

                                                                100'00
while that con<U+FB01>ned with the coagulum contained-—‘
                Oxygen..                              .. ...._8'57
                Carbonic acid .     . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    7'29

                                                                  l00'00
   It thus appears that the oxygen exerted a much more powerful
action on the coagulum, which contained                   the <U+FB01>brin and blood-cor
puscles, than on the serum, which contained only albumen.                          The ex~
periment thus corroborated the results previously obtained with pure
<U+FB01>brin and pure albumen.        The pure <U+FB01>brin was              seen to produce a much
greater change in the composition              of the atmospheric air than the
pure albumen from the hen’s egg.                The difference in the case of the
coagulum    and the serum was so much marked, that the author felt
anxious to <U+FB01>nd out whence it proceeded;                    and under the impression
that the haematin in the corpuscles might have mainly contributed to
   v0L. VIII.                                                                 I

the result (as other organic colouring matters possess the property                       of
absorbing oxygen and giving off carbonic acid gas), he took a small
quantity of pure blood-haamatin               prepared        by Verdeil’s process, and
put it into   a vessel along    with 1000 volumes of ordinary air.                    After
the air had been kept in contact with the haematin for some months,
the gas was analysed and found to contain
                  Oxygen    . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . .. l6'0l
                  Carbonic acid .      . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  3'80

The pure colouring principle of the blood, therefore, by exposure to
ordinary air, gives off carbonic acid gas, and becomes oxidized in two
ways   ;  <U+FB01>rst by  a loss  of carbon, and secondly by direct combination
with oxygen.       The author considers that this last result furnishes
additional evidence    of the correctness of an opinion he hazarded two
years ago"", imputing to the colouring                  matters of the vegetable and
animal economy a more important o<U+FB02>ice in the function of respiration
than    they   before had been considered                   to possess,     and regarding
their principal     function in organized                beings      as the absorbing     of
oxygen and exhaling       of carbonic acid-—a view altogether irrespective
of Liebig’ s well-known hypothesis,               which assigns the above o<U+FB01>ice to
the iron of the blood-haematin.
   The author concludes            by expressing            the hope that his experi
ments will be considered as at least serving to establish one import
ant fact respecting which further evidence was wanted, namely, that
the entire volume      of the respired oxygen is not transmitted in an
uncombined      state (as Magnus believes)                  to the various     organs and
tissues of the body, but that a portion               of it enters into chemical com
bination with some of the organic constituents of the blood.

     This. paper consists of two parts :‘ Part I. on Stresses and Strains ;
 Part II. on the Mechanical Conditions of Relation between Stresses
 and Strains experienced by an Elastic Solid.
     Part  I.-The   terms Stress and Strain are
                                                       _used
                                                             in accordance with
 the valuable de<U+FB01>nitions       by which they were <U+FB01>rst distinctively intro
 duced into the Theory         of Elasticity by Mr. Rankine*; with only
 this deviation; that instead of de<U+FB01>ning a stress as the reactive force
 exerted by an elastic body when in a condition of strain, the author
 of the present paper de<U+FB01>nes stress         as
                                               “ a de<U+FB01>nite external application
 of force to a body.”
     Various well-known theorems regarding the geometrical relations of
the displacements among the parts of a body in a state of strain, and
the geometrical representation of stresses and strains are enunciated,
and brie<U+FB02>y demonstrated,         for the sake of convenience.         A  mode   of
expressing in absolute measure the magnitude of a stress or a strain,
which the author believes to be new, is laid down nearly in the follow
ing terms.     The amount of work done by a stress applied to a body
of unit volume, while acquiring a strain of the same type as the stress,
is measured by the product qf the magnitude               of the stress into the
magnitude     of the strain.

   When         a stress and a strain             are   of the     same type, they are said to
be concurrent; or,             if directly       opposed, they are said to be negatively
concurrent.            When a stress and                a strain are        of any different types,
the degree of their concurrence, or simply
                                           “ their concurrence,”                                             is
measured by the work done by the stress applied to a body                                            of unit
volume acquiring the strain, divided by the product                                    of the   magnitude
of the        stress into the magnitude             of the strain.             The measure of per
                          +1, and that of perfect opposition — 1.
fect concurrence is therefore
When work is neither spent nor gained in the application of a cer
tain stress to a body while acquiring a certain strain, that stress and
that strain, or any            stresses     or strains of the same types respectively,
are said to be orthogonal                 to one another.               The measure of their con
currence is zero.

six independent variables, perfectly analogous to the system of triple
coordinates           for specifying        the position           of   a   point in        space,   is laid
down.           The concurrence             of   a stress or strain            with six orthogonal
types         of reference being denoted by I,               m, n, A, n,         w,    it is demonstrated

       Part     II.                                of the Differential
                      commences with an interpretation
Equation of the potential energy of Elasticity of solid, in terms of the     a
mode of speci<U+FB01>cation of stresses and strains laid down in Part                                              I.
The Quadratic Function expressing the potential energy of an elastic
solid when strained to an in<U+FB01>nitely small amount,                                 is    next considered;
and its simplest possible form, that                       of six squares with coe<U+FB01>icients,                  is
interpreted.            Hence proved that an in<U+FB01>nite number of systems
                                  it   is
of     six types of strains or stresses exist in any given elastic solid,

                                                          87'
    such that           a   strain of any        one      of    those types be impressed on the
    body, the elastic reaction is balanced by a stress orthogonal to the
    /ive others of the same system.
          It   is next shown that there is necessarily one, and in general only
    one, such system             of six types of strain for an elastic solid which are
    all mutually orthogonal; and the types belonging to this system are
    called the Six Principal Strain Types                        of the body.
         The characteristic of            a   Principal Strain Type            is,   that the stress re
    quired to keep          a   body in   a   state of strain        of such   a   type,   is   of the same
    type as the strain.             The six Principal Elasticities of                  a    body are the
    six coefficients by which strains of the six Principal Types must be
    multiplied to <U+FB01>nd the stress required to maintain them                                 .'
          In    conclusion, reasons are given for believing that natural crystals
    may exist for which there are six unequal Principal Elasticities, and
    consequently six different, and only six different,                              Principal Strain
    types.

    bodies under magnetic force,                 is   inferred, and      is    more fully considered

       The Commissioners appointed in 1838 to consider the steps to be
    taken for the reswration of the standards of weight and “measure, to
    replace those which were destroyed by the burning                                 of the Houses of
    Parliament, found provisions for the restoration of the lost standards
‘
    prescribed to them by Sections    and    of the Act 5th George IV.,

    whereby       it   is   directed that, in case of the loss of the standards,                         the

relation  to the length of the pendulum,                vibrating seconds of mean
time, in a  vacuum, at the level of the sea; and that the pound shall
 be restored by   taking the weight which bears                 a certain   proportion to
 the weight    of a cubic   inch of water weighed in                  a certain    manner.
 The Commissioners,      however, in their Report dated December                        21,
 1841, decline to recommend the adoption of these provisions for the
following reasons:     “Since the passing of the said Act it has been
 ascertained that several elements of reduction of the pendulum                       expe
riment therein referred to are doubtful or erroneous.                       It is evident,
therefore, that the course prescribed by the              Act would not necessarily
reproduce the length of the original yard.                   It   appears also that the
 determination   of the weight of      a cubic      inch of water is yet doubtful
 (the greatest di<U+FB02>'erence between the best English, French, Austrian,
 Swedish    and   Russian     determinations           being       about   ,_.,1,,  of the
whole    weight,   whereas    the   mere operation of weighing                     may   be
performed    to the accuracy     of            of the whole weight).               Several
                                    ‘mum
measures, however,      exist, which were most carefully compared with
the former standard yard;        and several metallic weights exist which
were most accurately      compared        with the former              standard    pound;
and by the use     of these the values of the original standards can be
respectively restored without sensible error.                    And we are fully per
suaded that, with reasonable precautions,                it will always be possible
to provide    for the accurate restoration             of standards by means of
material   copies which have been             carefully         compared      with them,
more securely than by experiments referring to natural constants.”
    At the end of the Travaux de la Commission                       pour <U+FB01>xer les Me
sures et les Poids de l’Empire de Russie, Professor Kup<U+FB01>'er has col
lected the results  of observations made in France, England, Sweden,
Austria and Russia for <U+FB01>nding the weight of a given volume of
water.    The resulting values of the weight of an English cubic inch
of water in a vacuum at 62° Fahr., expressed in doli, of which
2250-1'86 make a kilogramme,          are as follows         :
            French observations      . . . . . . l . . . . . . _     368'365
            English observations     . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     3682542
            Swedish observations         . . . . . . . . . .   ..    368'474

Assuming the Russian observations to                    be the best, as they        probably
are, it will be seen that a troy pound deduced according to the method
prescribed by the Act, would be 2'82!) grains too heavy; while,                           if the
Austrian observations had         been accepted as the best, the               troy pound
would have been 4'70? grains too heavy.                            On the other hand, it
was possible      to recover the weight                of the lost standard in air to
within   a fraction     of O'00l grain, by         means         of the troy pounds which
had    been compared      with   it,   and could be easily brought together for
recomparison.          Seeing, then, that the error of one of these two me
thods    of restoring the lost standard,               is   at least 2829 times as large
as the   error of the other method, the Committee could not hesitate
to recommend the adoption of the latter.
  A     Committee      was appointed Treasury Minute of June 20,
                                              by   a
1843, to carry out the recommendations contained in the ‘Report re
ferred to above.        The evidence for ascertaining the weight of the lost
standard,      placed at the service of this Committee,                  consisted    of the
following weights :—The brass troy pounds of the Exchequer O<U+FB01>ice;
the brass troy pounds from the cities of London, Edinburgh and
Dublin; the platinum troy pound and the two brass troy pounds
then in the possession of Professor Schumacher; the platinum troy
pound of the Royal Society;                  the troy pound used by the late
Mr. Robinson of Devonshire               Street, purchased            by the Committee;
four troy pounds made in 1758, two of which were formerly in the
possession of Mr. Bingley of the Royal Mint, one the property of
Messrs. Vandome and Titford, and one the property of the Bank of
England.
  The troy pounds of the Exchequer, and of the cities of London,
Edinburgh and Dublin had been compared with the lost standard by
Captain Kater in 1824.            The three troy pounds in the custody of
Professor Schumacher,         and the troy pound                   of the Royal Society,
were compared         with the lost standard with extraordinary                      care in
1829 by the late Captain v. Nehus.                The troy pounds bearing the
date    1758    were    constructed,        along with the lost standard, by
Mr. Harris, Assay Master of the Mint. These were referred to at
the suggestion of Professor Schumacher, in the hope of arriving at                           a
knowledge of the volume of the lost standard, which, unfortunately,
had never been determined              by   weighing        it   in water.   For,    as   long

                                               90
as the volume            of the lost standard remains unknown, the weight of
the air displaced  by              it,
                           and, consequently, its absolute weight,                             is
uncertain within limits far exceeding the errors of weighing.

    These weights were afterwards        compared with each other with a
balance    of extreme delicacy procured from Mr. Barrow. In its con
struction it nearly resembled the balances of the late Mr. T. C. Ro
binson.     The beam is made su<U+FB02>iciently strong to carry        a kilogramme
in each pan.       Instead  of having an index pointing downwards,         as is
usual in balances of this description,     a  thin slip of ivory is a<U+FB02>ixed to
one end    of the beam, a     little more than half an inch long, divided
into spaces of about 0'01 inch each.         This  scale is viewed  through a
compound      microscope having a single horizontal wire in the focus         of
the eye-piece.       A  screen was interposed     between the observer and       ‘
the front   of the balance-case, having a very small opening opposite
                                                                         '
to the eye-piece of the microscope.
    In making a large number of comparisons, the weights compared
are exposed to the risk of being injured by wear.             In order to ob
viate this danger, two light pans were used of very nearly equal
weight, each of which has a loop of wire forming an arch, the ends
of which are attached to the pan. at opposite extremities of a diameter
of the pan. To the upper point of the loop of wire is a<U+FB02>ixed an iron
hook. Each pan is suspended by a wire of suitable length bent into
a hook at either end, from the ring attached to the agate plane rest
ing on the knife-edge at either end of the balance.
    Calling theiweights of the pans X and Y, and the weights to be
compared P and Q, P was placed in X and Q in Y, and P-i-X com
pared with Q+Y n times; then P was placed in Y and Q in X, and
P+Y      compared n times with        Q+ X.    The weights were thus ex
posed to the wear      of two ordinary comparisons only in the course of
2n comparisons.        The mean of the 2n comparisons gives the differ
ence between      P  and  Q una<U+FB01>bcted by the very small, but unknown
difference between X and Y.            This contrivance was found to be
especially useful when either of the weights to be compared consisted
of several parts.
   In   using   the method      of double-weighing, the counterpoise was
placed in the left-hand pan of the balance, and the detached pan X
containing the weight P, and the detached pan Y containing the
weight Q, were alternately suspended from the right-hand end of the
beam, and the positions      of equilibrium deduced in each     case from the
extreme positions      of the beam at the beginning of each of three con
secutive oscillations    (usually twenty times).     The weights were then

                                                92
interchanged,         and the pan    Y    containing the weight P, and the pan             X
containing       the weight Q, suspended alternately from the right-hand
end     of the beam the       same number           of times.
      In   weighing       by Gauss’s method, in which the two weights                      to
be compared           as   suspended from           the right and left-hand        ends    of
the beam       respectively, and are then interchanged,                it was desirable
to be able to transfer the pans and the weights contained in them
from       one end        of the   beam    to    the other,      without opening          the
doors of the balance-case, and thus avoid sudden changes                           of tem
perature of air in the balance-case, and consequent production of
currents of air.  In order to effect this, a slender brass tube 38
inches long was made to pass freely through two holes in the ends
of the balance-case, which is nearly 23 inches long, near the top of
the case and half-way between the balance and the front of the case.
To the middle of the tube is attached                      a depending    loop    of wire.
Suppose that by sliding the tube the loop is brought near to the
right-hand end of the beam, and the pan with                      a weight     in it trans
ferred      from the end of the beam                 to the wire loop by a brass rod
having a hook at the end, which is inserted                     through   a hole    in the
right-hand end of the balance-case.                      By sliding the tube in the
opposite direction, the loop with the pan and weight suspended from
it,   is   brought near to the left-hand end of the beam, to which
                                                                                      it
                                                                                      is
transferred by        a   brass rod having      a   hook at the end, passing through
a   hole in the left-hand end of the balance-case.                A   similar tube    half
way between the balance and the back of the case, serves to transfer
the other pan and weight             from one end of the beam             to the other.
In this manner any number of comparisons may                          be made      without
opening the balance-case, except in the middle of the series, for the
purpose      of changing the pans.

    With the single exception of K, all the brass weights have become
heavier since they were compared with U, in consequence probably
of’ the oxidation of their surfaces, while U, which was made in 1758,
was protected        from further change by the coat of oxide already
formed.       One of these weights, Sb, appeared to have been protected
by gilding, though imperfectly,        since parts of its surface were slightly
                                                                                          _

had become lighter, was much tarnished.                    The discordances        pre
sented by the ditferent weighings          of  K    appear to have greatly per
plexed     both Professor      Schumacher      and Captain Kater, and were
probably the cause of the numerous and accurate comparisons of the
several troy pounds placed at the disposal             of the Committee with the
lost standard, on which alone depends the possibility of restoring                     it
with su<U+FB02>icient accuracy.          Previous to the comparison of           K  in 1844,
a  small fragment       of wood, like  a grain     of coarse sawdust, was found
adhering     so <U+FB01>rmly to its under surface, that it was detached with
some    dif<U+FB01>culty.      It appears probable that the changes            of the weight

                                       94
 of  K  were  caused by this bit     of wood being weighed with it after
 the <U+FB01>rst comparison       of K by Captain Kater, and by the gradual
 oxidation of the surface of K.       The discrepancies presented by the
 weighings   of the brass troy pounds at different times, due to the
 effect of oxidation or other causes, are so large, that I resolved, with
 the consent   of the Astronomer Royal, to rest for the evidence of the
 weight of the lost standard entirely on the 300 comparisons of Sp
 and the 140 comparisons of RS with U.
    If we consider the discordances presented by the weighings of the
 brass troy pounds simply as errors of observation, without paying
 any regard to their probable causes, the resulting value of         U will not
 be very different    from that given by the platinum troy pounds
 alone.

  The temperatures were determined                            by means of three thermo
meters by Bunten, having centesimal                          scales   etched upon the tube,
and two thermometers                having     arbitrary       scales traced        upon the tubes
with    a diamond          point.        The zero-points            of these were determined
at distant intervals.  They were often compared with each other,
and, lastly, with an excellent standard thermometer constructed at
Kew under the directions of Mr. Welsh, in order to form tables of
the errors at any point of their                scales,      and to determine the position
of their zeros at any given time.   The barometer employed was a
portable cistern barometer by Ernst of Paris, the scale of which was
divided       into millimetres.           It   was compared           <U+FB01>rst with the standard
barometer        of the Paris Observatory,                  and afterwards with a standard
barometer, having a tube of very large bore, belonging to the Taylor
Library of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge.

     The weight of air used in reducing         the weighings was calculated
 from the above expression.
     The mean rate of expansion of brass,.for          1°  Cent., from    0'’ Cent.
 to 100° Cent., usually assumed 0'0000l87            of its length at 0° Cent.,
 is considerably     larger than the rate of expansion at ordinary atmo
 spheric temperatures,      according    to the observations       of Mr. Sheep
 shanks, who      found that at about       17° Cent.    the coe<U+FB01>icient      of the
 linear expansion      of brass =0'0000l722 for       1°   lent.    This value of
 the expansion has been accordingly         adopted.
     The linear expansion of platinum is assumed to be 000000900
 for 1° Cent., as given by Schumacher in his <U+FB01>rst table (Phil. Trans.
  1836).    The expansion of water is calculated from             a mean     of the
experiments     of Despretz, I. Pierre and Kopp, corrected for the error
of the assumed expansion of mercury by Regnault’s observations,
and assuming the temperature of maximum density to be 3°'945
Cent., in accordance with the result obtained by Messrs. Playfair
and Joule.      The logarithms of the expansion to 7 places considered
as integers, are given      with sufficient accuracy, between 4° Cent. and
25° Cent., by     32'72(t—3'945)’—0'2l5(t—3'945)“.
     Though it appears that only two of the nine weights with which
U    was compared in 1826 and 1829 are in a state of unexceptionable
preservation,     and that the number        of trustworthy comparisons           is
reduced from 669 to 440, these are amply sufficient              for the purpose
of ascertaining the weight of U in air (t=65°'66 Fahr., b=29"/'5
inches).     But in order to <U+FB01>nd the absolute weight of U, or indeed

                                        97
its apparent weight in air of a density different from that which it
 has when t=65°'66 Fahr., b=29'75 inches, a knowledge of the
 volume of the lost standard is requisite.       An indirect way of arriving
 at it was suggested by Professor Schumacher,          by an examination of
 certain   Parliamentary Reports,       presented May 26, 1758,     April   11,
 1759,    March    2,   1824.     It appears from   the <U+FB01>rst of these, that
 Mr. Harris, then Assay Master of the Mint, presented to the Com
 mittee three troy pounds made under his direction, one of which was
 the lost Imperial standard; and from the third, that          one of the two
 remaining     pounds    came   into the possession of Mr. Vandome,        and
 the second into the possession         of Mr. Bingley of the Mint.       Pro
 fessor Schumacher       then observes that we can still either determine,
 with the highest degree of probability, the density of the lost Im
  perial standard, or know with certainty that all hope to arrive at this
  knowledge    is lost.    It will be only requisite to ascertain with the
  greatest care the densities     of both pounds, the one in the possession
  of Mr. Bingley, the other in the possession of Mr.Vandome.            If the
  density of both is found the same, we might from that circumstance
  draw the highly probable conclusion, that the three single pounds          of
  Mr. Harris, according to my hypothesis, were really made of the
  same identical metal; and the density of the two remaining pounds
  might with safety be considered as that of the lost standard.         If, on
  the contrary, the two remaining pounds prove to be of dgferent den
  sities, the hypothesis    that all three were made    of the  same metal is
  evidently erroneous;      and nothing can be inferred from the density of
  either of the two remaining.
      Mr. Vandome readily consented to allow his troy pound to be
  experimented     upon    by the Committee.       Denoting this weight by
  the letter V, by weighing in air and in water it was found that
  AV=8'l5084, and that it was about 0'309 grain lighter than U. -
      Mr. Bingley had in his possession two troy pounds, both dated
   1758.    One  of these, 0, said to     be the original weight from which
  the standard     was made for the House        of Commons in 1758, has
  since been purchased by the Committee; the other, M, has been pre
  sented to the Mint by Mr. Bingley.           As Mr. Bingley was unwilling
  to permit either of these weights to be weighed in water, Messrs.
  Troughton and Simms were commissioned to construct an instru
  ment on the principle of the Stereometer invented by M. Say for the

 in the Philosophical Magazine for             July   and December,          1834, vol. v.
 p. 203.      Let    1: pre<U+FB01>xed     to the symbol       of any weight denote the
 volume of that weight at 0° Cent., the unit of volume being the
 volume     of a    grain of water at its maximum density.                      Then, by
 means     of the Stereometer,           it was found that vV—-vO= 22'68,
 -vV—vM=l7'38.             These     differences    show that the volume            of lost
 standard cannot be inferred with any high degree                of probability from
 a comparison        of the remaining        pounds.      The only resource now
 remaining was indicated           by Professor Schumacher’          s   remarks on the
 <U+FB01>gure    of the lost standard :—“ As soon              as the     Imperial standard
 troy pound was brought to Somerset House, Captain Nehus’s <U+FB01>rst
 care was to make an accurate drawing of its shape and marks,
 measuring     all its dimensions with the greatest care. The annexed
 drawing represents this pound in its actual dimensions; and is now,
 since the original has been destroyed by the calamitous <U+FB01>re that con
 sumed the two Houses           of Parliament in 1834, the only thing remain
 ing which can preserve an idea of it.”              By a comparison of the <U+FB01>gure
 of U in the Philosophical Transactions for 1836, with a pro<U+FB01>le of V
 traced mechanically, the axis and the extreme diameter of the knob
 and cylindrical portion of U, appeared to be a very little greater than
the corresponding          dimensions of      V.     On comparing the pro<U+FB01>les            of
 U  and   V, it did not     seem possible to suppose         that the volume of          U
was less than that of        V.     But the volume of O,       as   well    as that  of M,
being less than that         of V, it appeared that of the three weights V,
O, M, V approximated most nearly to U in volume.                            As the exist
ing data were utterly insu<U+FB01>icient to determine how much, if at all,
 U exceededV in volume, it appeared safest to assume the volumes of
 U and V to have been equal.                This course    was    also recommended
by Professor Schumacher.
    It was afterwards found that O              was  0144 grain lighter than U,
AO=8'4004         ;    and    that   M     was   0047 grain lighter than U,

   The Commissioners for the Restoration of the Standards of Weight
and Measure,           in their Report, dated'December 21, 1841, recom
mended      that the avoirdupois           pound of 7000            grains     be    adopted
instead of the troy pound of                   New Parliamentary
                                       5760 grains, as the
Standard of Weight, and that the new standard and four copies of it
be constructed of platinum.
  In accordance with this recommendation, <U+FB01>ve weights were made
by Mr. Barrow, a little in excess of 7000 grains, of platinum pre
pared by Messrs. Johnson and Cock.                      The form of these pounds is
that of    a cylinder,       nearly 1'32 inch in height and 1'15 inch in dia
meter, with a groove round             it,   the middle of which          is   about      0'34
inch below the top of the cylinder, for insertion of the prongsiof                            a

  The weights of 7000 grains might have been derived from that of
5760 grains, by the use of either a decimal or   binary system of   a
weights.          In   either case, however, the number           of weights to       be com
pared with one another and with the weights                   of 7000 and 5760 grains
would have been large, and the errors of their comparisons                               among
themselves might, by their accumulation,                 sensibly a<U+FB02>'ect the resulting
 weight of 7000 grains.            Also, the repeated comparison                of weights
 made up      of the sum of several others,-was               a   very troublesome pro
 cess,   previous       to the use of the detached pans, already                    described,
 which had not been thought of when the weights were ordered.
    These two evils were in  great measure avoided by the use of
                                       a                                                      a

 of platinum, and all constructed by Mr. Barrow: A, B,             each             C,   D

 K, L, M, N        each of 80 grains;        R,   S   each   of 40 grains, nearly.           The
 numbers      of the weights of each denomination, and their values, are
 given     by the quotients        and divisors        obtained in the conversion             of

 -}-g-3%  into  a continued     fraction.     The errors of these weights are
 found by the following comparisons :-Sp and RS with T; T with
  A+B+C+D+F; each of the weights A, B, C, D with F+G;
  F with G+H        ;  G with each of the weights H+K, H-4-L, H-}-LI,
 H+N; HwithK+L+M+N+R and K+L+M+N-|-S; eachof
 the weights K, L, M, N with R+ S.
     Sp and RS, instead of being true troy pounds, and, consequently,
 equal to    U in  a vacuum,     had been adjusted so as to appear nearly as
 heavy as    U when weighed in air of ordinary density, and are there
 fore lighter than      U  by about 0'53 grain, the weight        of the air con
 tained in the space       equal to the difference between the volume           of
 U and that of Sp or RS.           A   space   equal to the difference between
 the volume of 7000 grains of metal           of the assumed density of U, and
 7000 grains of platinum, contains about 0645 grain of air.               Calling
 this Q, PS may be compared with each of the weights T+A+Q,
 T-f-B +Q, T+C+Q, T+D+ Q. In order to determine Q with the
 greatest precision,    Mr. Barrow supplied teu weights Q of about 0645
 grain each, so accurately adjusted that no appreciable di<U+FB01>'erence could
 be detected between      them;   a weight   V of 6-451  grains, and a weight  W
 of 12'90l grains, all of platinum. Then Y and Z being two platinum
weights of 20 grains each, the following comparisons became pos
sible :—each of the weights        R and    S with  Y+Z   ; each  of the weights
Y    and Z with   W+V+         each of the weights     Qin turn; W with V+
sum     of ten weights Q; V with the sum of the ten weights Q. In
comparing PS with each of the weights T+A+Q, T+ B+Q,
T+C+Q, T+D+ Q,                the weight       Q was changed at the end of
every four comparisons, and thus each of the ten weights Q used
in turn in    a series  of forty comparisons.
    By numerous       weighings in air and in water the densities of the
several weights were found to be as follows           :—

    By the good o<U+FB02>ices of M. Arago, permission was obtained from
the French Government           to compare the new English weights          with
the standard kilogramme         of platinum, known     as the kilogramme     des
Archives,     and which will be denoted by the letter Q.            The compa
rison was made by two perfectly independent methods.                   In one of
these 5 was compared sixty times with PC No. 1 + PC No. 2 +
auxiliary weight B+ a platinum weight V of nearly 192'436 grains.
 In the other, %,was <U+FB01>rst compared 200 times with the platinum
 kilogramme     QB‘,  purchased for the British Government.         (E was after
 wards compared with         PS+ each of the four platinum copies of the

 pound    in succession, together with        a platinum     -weight  of about
  l432'324 grains, the weight of which was found with great precision
 by a process to be described presently.
    Q had    never been   weighed-in water.     By observations made with
 the stereometer, it was found that at 0° C. the volume of Q exceeded
 that of QB by a quantity equal to the volume of 2l'll9 grains of
 water at its maximum       density.    By weighing    QB  in air and in water,
 it was found    that   A@=20'54877.         Some time after these observa
 tions were made, the Committee received from Professor Schumacher
 some observations     of his own in manuscript, and       a copy  of Professor
                                ‘
 Steinheil’s   paper, entiled     Das Bergkrystall-kilogramm,’        from the
 fourth volume of the Transactions        of the Bavarian Academy of Sci
 ences, containing    the determination   of the volume of $3, by comparing
its linear dimensions with those of a platinum kilogramme of his
 own 5, the density of which had been found by weighing it in air
and in water.        The two weights being cylinders, and the linear
dimensions      measured with an extremely delicate instrument con
structed by Gambey, this kind of observation admitted of being made
with great accuracy.       The resulting difference between the volume
of Q and that of QE, was found to be equal to the volume of 20'933
grains of water at its maximum density.           On account of the large
number of observations, and the extreme care with which they were
made, this value      of the volume Q-— volume       QE  is to be preferred to
that which      was obtained by      the stereometer, and has accordingly
been used in reducing the observations for comparing the weights              of
5   and (E.
    QE  was compared with      PS by the method which had proved so
satisfactory in deducing the avoirdupois pound from the troy pound.
Let   I, K, L, M, N    denote  PS and its four platinum copies, A, B, I‘, A,
platinum weights of about 1432'322 grains each, Z a weight of about
1270"/'08 grains, 9 a weight of l6l'629 grains, made up of weights
the values of which had been carefully determined.            Q? was compared
with each ofthe weights I+K+A, I+L+B, 1+M+I‘, I+N+A,
each of the lbs. K, L, M, N having been previously compared with I ;
I with A+B+I‘-I-A-|-Z; eachof the weights A, B, I‘, A with Z+9.
In this manner it was found that the kilogramme                  des  Archives
weighed l5432'34874 grains,          of which the new Imperial Standard
pound contains 7000, or kilogramme          =2'20Z162l 25 lb.      This is pro

                                       103
bably the best determination          of the weight of H in terms of the
English standard of weight.
  The value of Q, as deduced from the direct comparison of Q with
K+L+B+V,            is subject to some uncertainty,         arising    from the cir
cumstance that the platinum,of which A, B, C, F were made, had
been very badly prepared and contained cavities <U+FB01>lled with some
hygroscopic substance which rendered the weight of B slightly
variable, according to the greater or less amount of moisture present
in the atmosphere.         According to these observations, the kilogramme
des Archives      =l5432'348l6 grains.
   By the observations of Schumacher and Steinheil on the ratio of
the weight of Q to that of Sp, subject to an uncertainty of 000139
grain, on account of an error of the press, and the comparison                   of Sp
with PS, the weight of Q is either l5432'34873 or 15432‘-35012
grains, of which        PS contains 7000.

          or Prisms,   producing   anomalies in the illusion of Stereo
          scopic  Images.”      By A. CLAUDET,        Esq., F.R.S.      Re
          ceived  April 22, 1856.
                                  (Abstract.)
      The author having observed that photographic pictures represent
\
  ing <U+FB01>at surfaces, when examined in the refracting stereoscope, have
  the appearance of concavity,     has endeavoured to discover the cause
  of that phenomenon, and to explain it.
      In  order to ascertain  if this peculiar  effect was attributable  to
  some imperfection     in the lenses of the camera obscura which had
  produced     the photographic pictures, or to a property of the stereo
  scope itself, he began to test the stereoscope without photographic

                                        105
images.     For this experiment he placed under each tube of the                ste
reoscope a diagram composed of vertical and horizontal lines crossing
each other.
    The two diagrams, perfectly identical when seen in the stereoscope,
coalesced and formed only one <U+FB01>gure; but although each diagram,
when    seen   separately by its corresponding         eye,  appeared perfectly
<U+FB01>at, still the coalescing image         of the two presented      a surface con
spicuously    concave;     consequently there was no doubt that the same
illusion observed in photographic pictures           was due   only to the   e<U+FB01>'ect
of the stereoscope.         This experiment was decisive, and it remained
to discover     how     the illusion was produced.          The investigations
showed that the phenomenon,            which is   a defect detrimental     to-  the
beauty and correctness of the stereoscopic representations               and un
avoidable    in the refracting stereoscope, is       a plain illustration of the
cause  of relief and distance, and yield the clearest explanation of the
stereoscopic    illusion,-proving that it is founded on the true prin
ciples of natural binocular vision.
    When we look through a prism placed near the eye at a straight
line, the refracting edge of the prism being parallel with the straight
line, that line is refracted      laterally and appears bent, with its con
cave side turned to the thin edge of the prism.                The two tubes of
the stereoscope being supplied with semi-lenses acting as prisms, each
lens bends all vertical straight      lines, and the concave sides       of these
lines are turned       towards   the thin edges      of the lenses, and conse
quently towards each other.          When we examine in the stereoscope
two curved lines having their concave sides turned                 towards    each
other, the result of the coalescing       of these two lines is   a concave line,
the extremities appearing nearer and the centre further.              If the   con
vex sides are turned towards each other, the result of the coalescence
is a convex line, the extremities         appearing    further and the centre
nearer.     By the    same   reason, if  straight  lines are bent by the pris
matic refraction of the two semi-lenses, as the bending is effected so
that the concave sides- are turned towards each other, the result is
by coalescence      a concave line.      The two photographic images will
have all their vertical lines bent in the same manner, and the stereo
scope will give the illusion of a picture            represented   on a concave
surface.  -
    When we look at natural objects, the optical axes have to con
                                                              5

                                      106
verge more for the nearest than for the furthest, in order to obtain
a single vision  by bringing the      same   object   on the centre   of each
retina; therefore by habit      we  judge of the distances by the angle
formed by the optical axes required to obtain a single vision.          Again,
while we look at one object, while other objects in the         same  line are
situated before and behind that object,            we have the sensation     of
their double images on the two retinas. The double images of nearer
objects are situated    in the following order: one on the right of the
centre  of the right retina, and the other on the left of the centre of
the left retina; and the double images of further objects, one on the
left of the right retina, and the other on the right of the left retina.
   In looking   at the two pictures in the stereoscope, we have to con
verge the optical axes on one point which is beyond the plane           of the
pictures,  so that two of their correspondent or similar points appear
respectively on the two lines forming the angle of convergence           of the
optical axes, and each     of these points is represented on the centre
of one retina.    As the two corresponding points of the two pictures
are laterally nearer each other for the <U+FB01>rst plane and more distant
for the receding plane, it follows that the optical         axes have to   con
verge beyond the plane      of the pictures on    a nearer point for the <U+FB01>rst,
and on a further point for the last.          Therefore,   the angle   of con
vergence by which similar points        of the two pictures appear on each
axis and consequently fall on the centre of each retina, conveys the
sensation   of their respective distances;      more convergence indicates
less distance,   and less convergence more distance.           All  the other
corresponding    points   of the two pictures which are not on the op
tical axes  or on similar points of the two retinae, form double images ;
and when we look at one point, all the points of nearer and further
planes appear double in the same order on the two retinae,            as when
we look in like manner at natural objects       ; and the situation of double
images seen through the stereoscope indicates the distances of the
objects they represent, according as one is on the right of the right
retina and the other on the left of the left retina, or one on the left
of the right retina and the other on the right of the left retina.
   This being explained, it is      easy   to understand    what will be the
stereoscopic result of vertical lines represented as curved, and having
their concavities turned toward each other.           The two correspondent
points of the top and bottom of the two concave lines, being nearer
                   -

                                           107
each other, will require more convergence than the two correspond
ent poiuts     of the centres of the concave lines, and will appear nearer,
whilst the two points of the centre requiring less convergence will
appear further      ; the intermediate points from the centres to the extre
mities    of the two bent lines will appear gradually less distant, there
fore the coalescence of the two lines bent laterally will produce the
illusion of    a single   line conspicuously     concave, in a vertical plane at
 right angles with the plane of the two separate lines.
     Having demonstrated that the semi-lenses of the stereoscope, like
 prisms, bend laterally all the vertical lines of which the photograph
 pictures are composed, and that these lines in the two pictures pre
 sent their concavity to each other, it is evident that the coalescence
 of the two images must give the illusion of           a concave image.
     The phenomenon of the lateral curvature given to vertical lines by
 the refraction of a prism, which vertical lines, when examined with
 two prisms, one for each eye, appear by coalescence as one line con
 cave   iu  a vertical   plane at right angles with the plane          of the two
 separate bent lines, can be curiously illustrated by the following ex
 periment :—
    If,  holding in each hand one prism, the two prisms having their
‘thin edges towards each other, we look at the window from the
 opposite end of the room, we see <U+FB01>rst two windows with their vertical
 lines bent in contrary directions       ; but by inclining gradually the optical
 axes, we can converge them             until the two images coalesce, and      we
 see  only one window         ; as soon as they coincide, the lateral curvature
 of the vertical lines ceases, and they are bent projectively from back
 to front: we have then the illusion of a window concave towards the
  room, such as it would appear re<U+FB02>ected by a concave mirror.
     There is another phenomenon which can be noticed when looking
  at photographic pictures in the stereoscope; sometimes the picture
  appears to project out and sometimes to recede from its mountings.
  The <U+FB01>rst effect     lessens    the illusion, and the second renders it more
  effectual  ;  therefore    it is desirable to inquire how we can avoid the
  one and ensure the other.
     We know that the distance of objects is in             an inverse ratio   with
  the angle    of convergence required to       see them   single; also that with
  symmetrical     <U+FB01>gures or photographic pictures, when the horizontal           or
  lateral distances of the several corresponding           points is dilferent, the

                                        108
points less separated will appear nearer, and the more separated will
appear further.
    Suppose    the two correspondent       vertical  lines of the openings or
frames of the pictures be more distant           than the two correspondent
 points of the furthest plane of the pictures themselves, then the open
ings or frames will appear behind the pictures ; and suppose the cor
respondent vertical lines      of the openings    be less distant than the     two
 correspondent points      of the nearest plane of the pictures themselves,
 then the openings or frames will appear before the picture.
    Therefore,   when we wish to have the picture appearing behind the
openings or their mountings,        we have only to take care     that the cor
respondent     vertical  lines of the mountings       should   be laterally less
distant than the two correspondent          points of the <U+FB01>rst plane of the
                                                                        '
picture.    This can    be easily done    by taking the measure of the two
correspondent     points of the <U+FB01>rst plane by means          of a pair of com
passes,   and tracing      the two pairs     of correspondent     vertical   lines
bounding the openings,         after having slightly reduced the angle           of
the compasses.
   A  very simple experiment        may show the cause of the illusion           of
concavity of <U+FB02>at surfaces when examined             through semi-lenses, and
further prove that semi-lenses may give alternately the illusion of
concavity and convexity according to the position of their thin edges ;
of concavity when their        edges   are towards each other, and        of con
vexity when they      are   placed contrariwise.      For this experiment we
have only to employ a pair of those spectacles mounted with a spring
whereby they are held on the nose.
   When we read, holding such spectacles with both hands, we may
by the elasticity of the spring adjust the two lenses so that the pupils
of the eyes can coincide, <U+FB01>rst, with the two nearest edges, secondly,
with the two centres, and thirdly,           with the two furthest edges of
the lenses.
   In  the <U+FB01>rst case, the page     of the book will appear concave, because
the pupils will look through the thin edges of the lenses which bend
the vertical lines with their concave sides turned towards each other;
in the second, the page will appear <U+FB01>at, because the pupils will look
through the centres of the lenses which show the vertical lines per
fectly straight ; and in the third case, the page of the book will ap
pear convex, because the pupils will look through the thin edges                 of

                                          109
 the lenses which bend the vertical lines with their convex sides turned
 towards each other.
     These considerations       have led the author to construct           a stereo
 scope which presents <U+FB02>at surfaces perfectly <U+FB02>at.               This new stereo
 scope has two entire lenses instead          of two semi-lenses, and the       eyes
 look through the centre of such lenses.             The images not being late
 rally refracted,    as in the semi-lenticular     stereoscope, their coalescence
 requires    a  certain   e<U+FB01>'ort of divergence,      or to squinting outwards,
 which    a  little practice will enable us to perform           easily.    Persons
 capable    of using this kind of stereoscope will           see a   picture whose
 surface is perfectly <U+FB02>at with all the illusion of relief and distance.
     All  lenses being more        or less subject to the defect        of bending
 straight lines when refracted by all the various points           of their surface
 but the centre, and in       a greater degree    as those points are nearer the
 edges,   it results that when images          are produced    in the camera ob
 scura by the various points of the whole aperture,              they will be bent
 in various contrary        directions,   and a certain     confusion    must arise
injurious to the delicacy and correctness of the whole compound
 image.      This may be proved by the following experiments :——If we
 take the image of a window by a small aperture placed on the right
  edge of a lens, say of 3 inches aperture, and another image of the
  same window, by placing the aperture on the left, taking care to shift
  the camera so that the two apertures will be exactly on the same
  line, we shall have two images of the same window apparently                 iden
  tical ; but in placing these two images side by side in the central lens
  stereoscope above described, <U+FB01>rst the image of the left side aperture
  on the right, and that of      theright side aperture on the left, secondly
   the images vice verso‘, we shall      see in the <U+FB01>rst  case a concave window,
  and in the second         a convex     window.      But in examining‘ the two
  images in the semi-lenticular         stereoscope, we shall    see  in one  case a
   concave window,       and in the other a perfectly       <U+FB02>at window,      because
   in the <U+FB01>rst    case the stereoscope      will have increased the bending of
   the vertical lines of the two images, and in the second the stereoscope
   will have corrected the bending.
     ‘This fact naturally suggests the possibility of correcting the defect
   of the refracting stereoscope; for if the images of the camera were
   taken by semi-lenses, the bend resulting from this mode of operating
   might   be corrected    by the bend of the stereoscope, care being taken

                                       110
to turn the thin edge      of the semi-lenses of the two cameras in the
direction which will produce a bending contrary to that of the semi
 lenses of the stereoscope.
    Havingshown how the lateral proportional distances of any two
 correspondent points of the two stereoscopic pictures are the indices
 of their perspective distances, if we were, while looking in the stereo
 scope,  to produce a change in those proportional lateral distances by
 sliding horizontally in   a contrary   direction,  two pairs   of superposed
glass photographic pictures, the objects would appear to move, not in
the horizontal lateral direction of that change which they naturally
have, but in a straight line forward and backward, as            if  the object
was approaching     or receding.
    But the most curious effect of that motion would       be, that the objects
would appear increasing in     size while they were receding, and diminish
ing while approaching,       which we know is contrary to the rule of
perspective.    This is another illusion entirely physiological,        and the
 cause   of which may     be  thus explained; while the object appears
moving forward and backward          it remains always the      same size,  but
as We expect when     it moves forward that it should increase in size,
and when it moves backward that it should decrease, and as it does
not, we feel that it is diminishing when approaching            and increasing
when receding.
 lI.  “ A Memoir upon Caustics.”              By ARTHUR CAYLEY, Esq.,
        F.R.S. Received May 1, 1856.
                                  (Abstract.)
    The principal object of this memoir, which contains little or nothing
that can be considered new in principle, is to collect together the
principal results relating to caustics in plane, the re<U+FB02>ecting or refract
ing curve being    a right line or     a circle,  and to discuss with more
                                                                                ‘
care than appears to have been hitherto bestowed upon the subject,
some    of the more remarkable      cases.   The memoir contains in parti
cular researches relating to the caustic by refraction of a circle for
parallel rays,  the caustic by re<U+FB02>exion      of  a circle for rays proceeding

                                                    111
from    a point,      and the caustic by refraction                  of   a circle      for rays pro
ceeding from a point;               the result in the last case is not worked out,
but it is shown how the equation in rectangular coordinates is to                                 be
obtained by equating to zero the discriminant                          of     a rational and inte
gral function of the sixth degreej                          The memoir treats also of the
secondary caustic or orthogonal trajectory of the re<U+FB02>ected or refracted
rays   in the general           case    of    a re<U+FB02>ecting        or refracting circle and rays
proceeding from a point; the curve in question, or rather a secondary
caustic,   is,   as   is   well known,          the Oval of Descartes or
                                                                                     ‘

                                                                                                      ’
the equation       is   discussed by          a    method which gives rise to some forms
of the curve which appear to have escaped the notice of geometers.
By considering the caustic as the evolute of the secondary caustic,                                it
is   shown that the caustic in the general case of                        a   re<U+FB02>ecting or refract
ing circle and rays proceeding from   point      curve of the sixth

class only.  The concluding part of the memoir treats of the curve
which, when the incident rays are parallel,                            must be taken for the
secondary caustic in the place of the Cartesian, which, for the parti
cular casein question,                 passes      0<U+FB02>' to   in<U+FB01>nity.        In   the course   of the
memoir,     the author reproduces                    a   theorem <U+FB01>rst given, he believes,
by himself in the Philosophical Magazine,                              viz. that there are six
different systems          of   a   radiant      point and refracting circle which give
rise to identically the same                    caustic.  The memoir        divided into
                                                                                   is
sections, each   of which     to    considerable extent intelligible by
                                         is        a
itself, and the subject of each section    for the most part explained

        Lieut-Colonel JAMES, R.E., F.R.S., &c., Superintendent of
        the_Ordnance Survey.                        Received      April 30, 1856.
                                                (Abstract.)
   The Trigonometrical Survey of the United Kingdom commenced
in the year 1784, under the immediate auspices of the Royal Society                                   ;
the <U+FB01>rst base was traced                      by   General Roy on the 16th of               April of

                                              112
that year, on Hounslow Heath, in presence of Sir Joseph Banks,
then President of the Society, and some of its most distinguished
Fellows.
  The principal object which the Government had then in view, was
the connexion of the Observatories of Paris and Greenwich by means
of    a   triangulation, for the purpose of determining                  the difference       of
longitude        between the two observatories.
     A    detailed account of the operations           then carried        on is given        in
                                   ‘
the <U+FB01>rst volume of the                 Trigonometrical Survey,’ which is             a revised
                                                                           ‘
account       of that which was <U+FB01>rst published in the                          Philosophical
                      ’
Transactions              for 1785 and three following years.
  At the time when these operations were in progress, the Survey of
several counties in the south-east of England, including Kent, Sussex,
Surrey, and Hampshire, was also in progress, under the direction                              of
the Master-General of the Ordnance,     for the purpose of making
mi-litary maps of the most important parts of the kingdom in a mili
tary point of view; and it was then decided to make the triangula
tion which extended from Hounslow to Dover the basis of                               a   trian
gulation for these surveys.
     It   is extremely to be regretted         that a more enlarged view                  of the
subject had not then been taken, and a proper geometrical projection
made for the map of the whole kingdom.                     As it   is,   the south-eastem
counties were <U+FB01>rst drawn and published in reference to the meridian
of Greenwich, then Devonshire in reference to the meridian of But
terton in that county, and thirdly the northern counties, in reference
to the meridian            of Delamere in Cheshire     ;   but there      is   a   large inter
mediate space, the maps of which are made                    of various sizes to ac
commodate them to the convergence                   of the meridian.
     In    1799 the Royal Society gave further proof of the interest                         it
took in the progress            of the Survey, by lending to the Ordnance its
great 3-foot Theodolite, made by Ramsden, for the purpose of expe
diting the work of the Survey; and although this instrument has
been in almost constant use for the last sixty-seven years, during
which time        it      has been placed on the highest church towers and the
loftiest mountains            in the kingdom, from the Shetlands to the Scilly
Islands,    it   is    at this day in perfect working order, and probably one
of the very best instruments that was ever made.
  The great Trigonometrical operations                     of the Survey have been

                                      113
 carried on under so many o<U+FB02>icers, from the time of their commence
 ment under General Roy down to the present time, that it would be
quite impossible, in this short notice, to mention more than the names
 of several Superintendents       who have succeeded General           Roy, viz.
 Colonel Williams, Major-General Mudge, Major-General Colby, and
 Colonel   Hall; but in justice    to the highly meritorious       body of non
 commissioned ot<U+FB01>cers of the Corps of Royal Sappers and Miners, it
 should be stated, that whilst in the early part of the Survey the most
 important and delicate observations were entrusted solely to the com
 missioned o<U+FB01>icers, these duties have of late years been performed by
 the non-commissioned      officers with the greatest     skill and accuracy.
    The computations connected with the corrections of the observed
 angles, to make the whole triangulation as nearly as possible perfectly
 consistent, have been most voluminous,          and have been made under
 the direction    of Lieut.-Colonel      Yolland,     Captain Cameron,        and
 Captain Alexander R. Clarke; but Col. James gladly avails himself
 of this opportunity to acknowledge the great and important assist
 ance and advice which, both as regards the instruments             and the cal
 culations, have at all times been received from the Astronomer Royal.
    The triangulation, by the methods which will be explained, is now
 made consistent in every part, so that any side of any triangle being
 taken   as a base,  the same distance will be reproduced when it is
 computed through any portion or the whole series            of triangles   ; and
 when    the <U+FB01>ve measured bases        relied   on are   incorporated     in this
 triangulation, the greatest difference between their measured                and
 computed    lengths   is not as much as 3 inches, and yet some of the
_bases are upwards    of 400 miles apart.
    Several bases  of from <U+FB01>ve to    seven miles   long have been measured,
 but those upon which the chief reliance has been placed are the
  Lough Foyle and Salisbury Plain bases which were measured with,
  General   Colby’s compensation       bars.     The difference between the
 measured and computed length        of the one base from the other through
 the triangulation is 04178 ft., or about        5 inches.
    This diiference has been divided in proportion to the square root
 of the lengths of the measured      bases,   by which the mean      base  which
 has been used in the triangulation has been obtained           ; there is there
 fore a difference of, + or    -02 ft.,     or 2%   inches between the mea
 sured and computed length of these bases from the mean base.

                                      114
    The Hounslow Heath         base was measured     with Ramsden’s     100  ft.
 steel chains, and only differs 0' l 73   ft., or about   2 inches,   from its
 computed length from the mean base.
    The Belhelvie    base  in Aberdeenshire,    also measured with the steel
 chains, differs only 0'24 ft., or less than 3 inches, from the computed
 length.
    The difference between the measured and computed length of the
 Misterton Carr    base,   near Doncaster, also measured with the steel
 chains, is only O'l57 ft., or less than 2 inches; and it will be ob
 served that the dilference       between the      computed    and
                                                                     measured
 lengths of these three bases (measured with chains) is not greater
 than the difference between the measured and computed length of
 the Lough Foyle and Salisbury Plain bases           measured with the com
 pensation   bars), from which it may be inferred, that bases measured
 with  steel chains are deserving    of the greatest con<U+FB01>dence ; and when
 the great simplicity, portability, and cheapness of the chains are
 compared with the complex, heavy and expensive apparatus of the
 compensation     bars, it may be anticipated       that they will be more
 generally employed than they have been of late years, especially in
the colonies, and in countries where the transport        of heavy articles is
 effected with difficulty.
    The length of the base on Rhuddlan Marsh in North Wales, which
was measured with steel chains, differs 1'596 ft..from the computed
length; but from the circumstance that the extremities of the base
are very badly situated with reference to the surrounding Trigono
metrical stations, the angles being very acute and not well observed,
little con<U+FB01>dence has been placed in the result of the comparison of
its computed and measured length.
    One   of the <U+FB01>rst practical results arising from the completion of
the triangulation    is, that it is now possible to engrave the latitude
and longitude on the marginal lines       of the old  sheets  of the one-inch
Map of England, and this is now being done.
    The following account of the Trigonometrical operations and cal
culations has been drawn up by Captain Alexander            R. Clarke, R.E.    ;
this account may      be considered an abridgement      of that more detailed
account which is now in the press, and will be shortly published.
    It will be seen that the equatorial diameter of the earth,      as derived
from   the Ordnance Survey, is 7926'6l0          miles,  or  about   one  mile

                                                       115

the Earth,’         and that the ellipticity is 5&5; or as the Astronomer

any reliance has been placed, viz.‘ the Schehallien                                    observations,         is,   as

  From the pendulum                  experiments,                at    a    great depth and on the
surface, the Astronomer Royal obtained 6'566.
  Two copies of the new National Standard Yard have recently been
received through the Astronomer   Royal, and       obviously neces               it      is
sary that the geodetic measures should be given in reference to the
standard   ;       but not knowing from what                          scale    the standard has been
taken, Col. James         is   unable to say at present in what way the re
duction    is   to be made     ;     that        is,   whether by reference to the compa
rison of the old standards which have been already made, or by the
mechanical process of          a     direct comparison of the Ordnance Standard
with the new National Standard.

     The position of the author,     as Medical Superintendent of the Surrey
  Lunatic Asylum, has enabled him to make the peculiar application
  of Photography, of which he gives an account in the present commu
'
  nication.     He,points out the advantages to be derived from photo
  graphic portraits of the insane,      as faithfully representing the features
  of the   disease  in its different forms, or its successive phases in the
  same patient,    and as affording unerring records for study and com
  parison by the physician and psychologist.             In the course of the
  paper frequent reference is made to the series of photographic por
  traits  of lunatic patients with which it was accompanied.
  II.  “ On the Problem of Three Bodies.” By the Rev.J. CHALLIS,
         M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S., Plumian Professor of Astronomy
         and Experimental        Philosophy in the University of Cam
         bridge.      Received May 15, 1856.
                                    (Abstract.)
     The object of the author is to give an approximate          solution of the
  Problem of Three Bodies, equally applicable to the motion of the
  moon and to that of a planet, in which the forms of the develop
  ments of the radius-vector, longitude, and latitude in terms of the

time, are directly determined                  by the analysis.       The solution to the
<U+FB01>rst power of the disturbing force is effected by means of the follow
ing three equations, in which the letters have the signi<U+FB01>cations
usually given to them in the planetary theory                     :
             dr“     /L“     2;:          _       J99     dR          (IR dr
             .n§+;@-7+°-§~{?.1?(lnm"‘)"$ mid’
After substituting           in the right-hand side of the <U+FB01>rst equation, the
values of    r and    0    given by a <U+FB01>rst approximation in which the disturb
ing force is neglected, that side becomes                  a   known function    of t. The
equation can then be integrated                   approximately       so as to give the de
velopment       of r in terms of t to the <U+FB01>rst power of the disturbing
force, and to any power of the eccentricity                    it may   be   thought proper
to retain.         By substituting in that term of the second equation
which    does      not contain the disturbing force the value of 1- thus ob
tained, the integration of the equation gives the development of 6 in
terms of t, and lastly by substitution in the third equation a is simi
larly developed.   The author has shown the practicability of this
method by obtaining values of r and 0 to terms of the order of the
eccentricity multiplied by the disturbing force; The development of
the latitude, and a more particular application                       of the method to the
motion    of the moon,              are   reserved for_ future        consideration.   The
particular advantages of this mode of solution are, that being free
from all assumption as to the forms of the developments, it gives
those which are alone appropriate                       to the problem,      and it evolves
both the periodic            and the secular inequalities             by the same process.
Terms containing            ent as a factor, which are met with in other solu
tions of the same problem, do not occur in this method; but there
are terms containing               the factor e'nt, which are shown to be convert
ible into periodic          functions,        and to have reference to secular varia
tions of the eccentricity   of the motion of the apse. The paper
                                     and
concludes with some general remarks on the principle of this approxi
mate solution of the problem of three bodies, and an explanation of
the analytical        circumstances            which make       it,   in common with the

                                      119
 method of the variation         of parameters,    proper    for determining
 directly the motion of the     apses of an orbit.
 III._ “On    some   of the Products of the Distillation of Boghead
       Coal at low temperatures.”           By C. GaEv1LLn WILLIAMS,
       Esq., Assistant to Dr. Aunnason, Professor of Chemistry
       in the University of Glasgow.              Communicated by Dr.
       SHARPEY, Sec. R.S. Received May l4, 1856.
    In presenting a brief preliminary notice of an investigation        of the
substances obtained by distilling boghead coal at low temperatures,            I
may observe that     I  was induced   to undertake it from remarking the
low density of the naphtha produced          in the process; it being only
'750 at 60° F., although its boiling-point, previous to the recti<U+FB01>ca
tions, was as high as 290°      F.
    After <U+FB01>fteen complete fractionations of the portion distilling below
310° F., boiling-points were obtained as low as 170°, and it was
found that the <U+FB02>uid could be separated, by careful treatment with
fuming nitric, or a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids, into two
bodies, one forming a nitro-compound,         the other being unacted on.
The latter   was washed several times      with  a strong alkaline   solution,
and, after being digested for a few days with sticks             of potash to
remove adherent     moisture, recti<U+FB01>ed over sodium.         In this  manner   I
obtained   a colourless   and very mobile     <U+FB02>uid with   a pleasant    odour,
distantly resembling that of hawthorn blossoms.            Its density at 60°
was ‘T25.
    I selected  the   fraction boiling in the <U+FB01>fteenth        recti<U+FB01>cation   at
240°   F. to make   a  preliminary experiment upon, and, after puri<U+FB01>ca
tion in the manner described, it gave in three perfectly concordant
analyses, exactly the per-centage      of carbon and hydrogen         required
for butyl (valyl of Kolbe),      the radical of the butylic alcohol.      Two
determinations   of the vapour density, taken respectively at 80° and
107° above its boiling-point, gave numbers          closely coinciding with
theory.                                                         5
   When it is considered       that 68° or more of differeiice of boiling
point only cause   a  variation of 03 in the per-centage df carbon and
hydrogen of bodies of this class, it becomes evident that            if I  had
                                                              M2

  taken the fraction boiling at 223°      (Wurtz) or 226'’ (Kolbe), it would
  have yielded the same results.        This point is now under examination.
      The formula                    -
                                 C“ H"‘=4 vols.,
‘
  corresponds     not only to butyl, but also to the hydruret       of caprylyl,
   and, of course, both these bodies have the same vapour density; but
   several circumstances     lead me    to believe the hydrocarbon       I  have
  obtained to be the radical of the butylic alcohol.        The density of the
  fluid, and the temperature at which it distils,          are also rather in
  favour of this view.        It will be seen that 247° F. should         be the
  boiling-point of butyl     if Frankland's determination      of that of amyl
  be correct, and Kopp’s law hold with these bodies.
     A   careful study   of the papers already published on the radicals of
  this series, shows that more than one anomaly appears to exist in
  their physical properties, the gradations usually observed in homo
  logons groups not being so distinctly marked as with most others,
  and this fact somewhat impedes their identi<U+FB01>cation.                 The large
  quantity of substance which becomes at our disposal from the source
  mentioned, will, by facilitating the study, throw light on these points.
      I believe I  shall be able to isolate at least four of the radicals, viz.
   propyl, butyl, amyl, and caprotyl,         from the coal distillate.      The
  per-centage    composition    varying   so little with the different homo
  logues,   I rely chie<U+FB02>y on vapour density and products of decomposi
  tion  as the means    of proving their presence.
     The hydrocarbons accompanying the radicals are also quite distinct
  from the benzole series, as shown by the low density of the nitro
   compound.       The latter is extremely diflicult of reduction by sulphide
   of ammonium or protacetate of iron, but it furnishes a volatile oily
  alkaloid by distillation with an alcoholic solution of potash.
      The tedious puri<U+FB01>cations andthe numerous operations required
  before the substances can be obtained         in a state of sufficient purity
  for analysis from the coal distillate, will probably       cause a consider
  able period    to elapse before a detailed account     of all the bodies can
  be published.

IV.    “ On Peristaltic Induction of Electric Currents.”
                                                                                  By Pro
     fessor   WILLIAM THoMsoN, F.R.S.                    Received May 10, 1856.
     Recent observations on the propagation of electricity through wires
in subaqueous and subterranean telegraphic                  cables have brought to
light phenomena of induced electric currents, which, while they are
essentially different          from the phenomena        of what has hitherto           been
called electro-dynamic           induction, are exactly such       as   might have been
anticipated       from the well-established         theory of electrical equilibrium,
had experiment           afforded the data       of relation between electrostatical
and electro-dynamic             units wanted for determining           what dimensions
of wire would be required                to render these phenomena              sensible to
ordinary observation.             They present      a very perfect analogy        with the
mutual in<U+FB02>uences of             a number   of elastic tubes bound together late
rally throughout their lengths,               and    surrounded     and <U+FB01>lled with a
liquid which is forced through one or more of them, while the others
are left with their ends open (unineulated), or stopped (insulated), or
subjected to any other particular conditions.                   The hydrostatic press
ure applied to force the liquid through any of the tubes will cause
them to swell and to press against the others, which will thus, by
peristaltic action, compel the liquid contained in‘ them to move, in
different parts of them, in one direction or the other. A long solid
cylinder of an incompressible elastic solid *, bored out symmetrically
in four, six, or more circular passages parallel to its length, will cor
respond to an ordinary telegraph              cable containing         the same number
of copper wires separated from one another only by gutta-percha:
and the hydraulic motion will follow rigorously the same laws as the
electrical conduction,           and   will be expressed by identical language in
mathematics,         provided      the lateral     dimensions    of the bores are            so
small in comparison   with their lengths, or the viscosity of the liquid
so   great, that the motions are not sensibly affected by inertia, and
are consequently           dependent altogether        on hydrostatic pressure and
<U+FB02>uid friction.           The electrical induction now alluded to depends on
the electrostatic         forces determined       by Coulomb;      but    ‘it   would   be   in
              *   Such   as   inrlia-rubber very approximately    is   in reality.

                                                 122
one respect a real, and in all respects an apparent, contradiction                                of
terms, to speak            of electrostatic induction of electric currents, and                    I
therefore       venture to introduce            the term peristaltic           to characterize
that kind of induction by which currents                          are  excited in elongated
conductors through the variation of electrostatic potential in the sur
rounding matter.              On the other hand,             as any inductive      excitation     of
electric motion might be called electro-dynamic                          induction, it will be
convenient to distinguish the kind of electro-dynamic                           induction <U+FB01>rst
discovered by Faraday, by a distinctive                       name; and      as the term elec
tro-magnetic,         which has been         so applied, appears          correctly character
istic,   I  shall call electro-magnetic             induction that kind of action by
which electric currents are excited, or inequalities of electric potential
sustained, in a conductor of electricity, by variations of magnetic or
electro-magnetic            potential,    or by absolute         or relative motion         of the
conductor itself across lines              of magnetic or electro-magnetic force.
     The most general problem of peristaltic induction is to determine
the motion         of electricity in any number                  of long conducting wires,
insulated from one another within an uninsulated                          tube of conducting
material, when subjected                each to any prescribed             electrical action at
its extremities         ;  without supposing any other condition regarding the
sections and relative dispositions                of the conductors           than—(1), that
their lateral dimensions and mutual distances are so small in propor
tion to their lengths, that the effects of peristaltic induction are para
mount over those of electro-magnetic induction; and (2), that the
section     of the entire system of conductors, if not uniform in all parts,
varies so gradually as to be sensibly uniform through every part of
the length not a very large multiple of the largest lateral dimension.
In    the present communication               I  shall only give the general equations
of motion by which the physical conditions to be satis<U+FB01>ed are ex
pressed for every case; and I shall con<U+FB01>ne the investigation of solu
tions to certain cases           of uniform and symmetrical arrangement, such
as are commonly used in the submarine telegraph cable.
     At    any time t, let        q1, q2. q3,    &c.     be    the quantities     of electricity

 <U+FB01>rst given by Green in his Essay on the Mathematical Theory of

                                                125
Electricity and Magnetism (Nottingham, 1828), leads to an a<U+FB01>irmative
answer to this question.
    The general theorem to which                    I   refer   is,   that      if,   considering      the
forces due respectively to two different distributions of matter (whether
real, or such as          is   imagined in theories of electricity and magnetism),
we denote by N1,               N, their normal components              at any point of           a   closed
surface, or group            of closed surfaces,        S,   containing all parts of each dis
tribution of matter, and by V,, V2 the potentials at the same point
due respectively to the two distributions, and   ds be an element of   if
the surface         S,   the value    of
                                       /'   /‘N ,V,ds
                                                         is   the same as that             ofN,V,ds
(each being equal to the integral                /'
                                                 /'
                                                 /'           R,Pt, sin     0   dz dy dz extended
over the whole               of space external to the surface                     S,    at any       point
(.z',   y,   z)   of which external space the two resultants are denoted by                                   I
R,, B, respectively, and the angle between their directions by 6).
To apply this with reference to the proposed question, let the <U+FB01>rst
distribution of matter consist of               a   certain charge,          q,   communicated           to
one of group of insulated conductors, and the inductive electri<U+FB01>ca
             a
tions of the others, not one of which has any absolute charge; let
the second distribution of matter consist of the electri<U+FB01>cations of the
same group of conductors when an equal quantity               given to                 g   is            a
second  of them, and all the others are destitute of absolute charges;
and let surface be the group of the surfaces of the different conductors.
                         S
Since the potential             is   constant through each separate conductor,                          the
integral     /'
             ‘/~
                    N,V2 ds will       be equal to the sum             of   a   set    of terms of the
form [V,] [~/_/N,ds], where [V,] denotes the value in any of these
conductors of the potential of the second distribution, and [-/'/'N,ds]
an integral including the whole surface of the same conductor, but
no part of that of any of the others.                        Now by    a    well-known theorem,
<U+FB01>rst given by Green,                              is    equal to 41rq      if         denote the abso
                                     [f/Nlds]                                   q
lute quantity of matter within the surface of the integral (as the case                         is
for the <U+FB01>rst group of conductors), and vanishes       there be no distri    if
bution of matter, or (as              is   the case with each         of   the other conductors)
if      there be equal quantities of positive and negative matter within the
surface           over which the integral        is     extended.       Hence         if   [V,], denote
the potential            in the <U+FB01>rst conductor due to the second distribution of
matter, we have
                               f     /'    N ,V,ds=41r[V,],q.

                                             126
 Similarly,    we have
                              //N,V,ds=41r[V,],q.
'Hence, by the general theorem, we conclude                    [V,],=[V,],,    and so
 demonstrate the affirmative answer to the question stated above.
     I think it unnecessary to enter on details suited to the particular
 case  of lateral electrostatic in<U+FB02>uence between neighbouring parts of a
 number of wires insulated from one another under a common con
 ducting sheath, whenkuniform or varying electric currents are sent
 through by them ; for which a particular demonstration in geometry
 of two dimensions, analogous to the demonstration of Green’s theorem
 to which    I   have referred as involving the consideration              of a  triple
 integral for     space   of three dimensions, may be readily given; but, as
 a particular case of the general theorem             I   have now demonstrated,      it
 is obviously true that the potential in one wire due to a certain quan
 tity of electricity per unit of length in the neighbouring parts of an
 other under the same sheath, is equal to the potential in this other,
 due to an equal electri<U+FB01>cation            of the <U+FB01>rst.
    Hence the following relations must necessarily subsist among the
 coefficients of mutual peristaltic induction in the general equations
                                                                                  ‘

 subject to mutual         peristaltic    in<U+FB02>uence,  fails when these conductors
 are symmetrically         arranged within a symmetrical           conducting   sheath
 (and therefore actually in the case of any ordinary multiple wire tele
 graph cable), from the determinantal equation having sets of equal
 roots.    Regular analytical methods are well known by which the solu
 tions for such particular        cases may be derived from the        failing general
 solutions; but it is nevertheless interesting to investigate each par
 ticular  case specially,     so as to obtain its    proper solution by a synthe
 tical process, the simplest possible for the one case considered alone.
 In the present communication, the problem of peristaltic induction
 is thus treated for some         of the most common            cases  of actual sub
 marine telegraph cables, in which two or more wires of equal dimen

_   ducting sheath of circular section.

       Gnoaen KEMP, M.D. Cantab.                  Communicated by the
        Rev. W. CLARK, M.D., F.R.S., Professor of Anatomy in
       the University of Cambridge.           Received May 1, 1856.

    Referring to the well-known difference in      taste and other  physical
properties between the bile as it immediately proceeds from the liver
and the same <U+FB02>uid after it has been retained for a time in the gall
bladder, the author observes, that the nature of this difference and
the agency by which it is effected, are questions which have not yet
met with the attention       they deserve, and that he had accordingly
been led to make them the subject of experimental inquiry.               As,
however,    it is only on rare occasions that the hepatic bile can be
procured in quantity su<U+FB02>icient for chemical experiment, and then
only at the risk of its being altered by pathological conditions
of the secreting organ, the author considers that, however clearly
individual facts on the subject may      be demonstrated,    any deductions
made therefrom       must be referred to the lower department        of pro
bable evidence;      and it is with this reservation that he lays his con
clusions before the Royal Society, whilst, at the same time, he
 believes that, so far as the nature of the case admits, he has been
able to elicit a new fact respecting the mucous membrane of the gall
bladder, which may lead to the better comprehension         of the functions
of mucous membranes generally.
    Assuming, in the <U+FB01>rst place, that the change in properties which
 the bile undergoes in the gall-bladder is brought about either by the
 mucous secretion     of that reservoir, or by some operation exerted by
 its internal membrane, it is observed, with respect to the action of
 the mucus,     lst, that when left in the gall-bladder in contact with
 the cystic bile, it is capable of subverting the composition of that
 <U+FB02>uid.    2nd, That this change is much accelerated by even a mode
 rately elevated temperature.       3rd, That when the contents       of the
 gall-bladder   are evaporated to a   syrupy consistence, the bile, at <U+FB01>rst
    VOL.   VIII.                                                N

                                                 134
neutral,      becomes         alkaline     and    broken up into several            organic
groups.       4th, That         if   the mucus     of the gall-bladder        be   carefully
                     or acetic acid, and the perfectly fresh
removed by alcohol                                           bile be
then evaporated, these changes do not take place.
   From these facts it follows that the mucus of the gall-bladder is a
highly catalytic body, and that the analysis of bile which has been
left in contact with           it,
                       under the conditions above stated, must lead
                                                                                           '
to varying and unsatisfactory               results.
  From these considerations    naturally occurred to try the effect of
                                           it
placing the mucus of the gall-bladder in contact with hepatic bile;
but the experiment was not performed, as    was found impracticable
                                                              it
to obtain the mucus of the gall-bladder free from cystic bile without
precipitation        by reagents.    Desiring, however, to ascertain whether
the mucus       is   principally retained in contact with the inner surface of
the gall-bladder or diffused through its contents, the author subjected
the gall-bladder             and its contained         <U+FB02>uid,    taken   from an ox just
slaughtered,        to   a   freezing mixture     of snow and salt, until all but the
central part of the <U+FB02>uid was frozen, and on pouring out the latter
found    it   to contain mucus; thus showing                   that this secretion   is   not
merely con<U+FB01>ned to the inner surface                    of the gall-bladder for the pur
pose of protection           and lubrication      of the subjacent membrane, but           is
diffused throughout the bile contained in that reservoir.
   Leaving now the mucous secretion, the object was <U+FB01>rst to ascer
tain whether the mucous membrane itself possesses the property
of changing the molecular                 structure of the bile; then to observe
whether    it   possesses       any analogy to other           mucous membranes, such
as the epithelial membrane               of the calf’   s   stomach, &c., in acting upon

  December           ll,
                  l855.—The mucous membrane of the gall-bladder
was dissected, or rather stripped from the other portion of the viscus,
and washed in several waters, until the mucous                          secretion and bile
disappeared     ;    a     small portion was now placed in an evaporating              dish

                 ‘—_—~                    135                        -
 and    covered with fresh       ox-bile,  from which the mucus         had been
  carefully removed     ;  the bile also was tested with diluted acetic acid,
                                                                                   i
 giving no precipitate or appearance of turbidity.             The whole was, at
  l P.M., placed in a warm situation.         At 3 P.M. the solution was tested
  with acetic acid, when it became densely turbid. Temperature,
 43°'5 C. The peculiar odour of musk was very distinct in this solution,
 though not perceptible in the remainder of the fresh bile.               A  small
 duantity of water was added, to replace that lost by evaporation, and
 the solution returned to its warm situation.               6 ]?.M. again tested,
 with similar results; the musky odour very strong.                    7'30 P.M.
 again tested, when not only was the solution rendered turbid, but a
 white   precipitate   was thrown down         ;  the <U+FB02>uid was also distinctly
 alkaline.                                               _
    The mucous lining of the gall-bladder is therefore           a catalytic body
 capable   of producing molecular changes in the bile.

           Bodies which readily break up into Organic Groups.
      \
    Milk.    December     18.—A portion of mucous membrane was scraped
 and washed with scrupulous care, in order that the whole of the
 mucus might be removed ; it was then covered with fresh milk and
 exposed    to a temperature       of 32° C.       In  one hour the <U+FB02>uid was
 separated    into serum, turbid with caseine, and an over-stratum              of
 a  creamy     substance greatly     resembling      butter,  thus  exhibiting   a
catalytic in<U+FB02>uence        very analogous     to the action      of rennet.    The
whole     contents   of the evaporating dish were then set aside, as
having effected the object of the experiment ; on the 21st, however,
the author was induced to taste the <U+FB02>uid, and, to his astonishment,
found it intensely bitter, and, what is more remarkable, on applying
Pettenkofer’s well-known test of sugar and sulphuric acid, with
increase    of temperature, the characteristic        rose-tint was developed.
The musky smell was not observable.
    Honey. December 26.—A portion of mucous membrane, carefully
washed, was covered with a solution of honey (one measure of honey
to three    of water).       After six hours’ exposure at 38° C., it was
found bitter, and gave a precipitate with diluted acetic acid; this
was  not the    case with the original solution.       The <U+FB02>uid, being slightly
acid, was carefully      neutralized   with carbonate of soda.        The taste,
                                                                  N 2

                                        136
after another period of six hours, was very bitter.             On the 28th the
<U+FB02>uid had evaporated down to          a thick honey consistence.
   The next remark         on this subject,     in the author’s      rough notes
taken at the time, is the following       :—
    January 27.—“The honey solution is now nearly evaporated.                    A
mass    of crystals (grape-sugar) with        a small    quantity of syrup, in
tensely bitter.”       The syrup could      be   readily poured off from the
crystals.     The mucous membrane was not in the slightest degree
decomposed;       swelled and elastic, not splitting into layers.
   It  is well known that, after long keeping, granules           of grape-sugar
are found in honey      ; therefore, on the 22nd       of April, the honey from
which the experiments were made was re-examined, and found to be
nearly    homogeneous       and not    separated into crystals        and   syrup;
indeed    the whole     physical   appearances      are so   di<U+FB01>'erent from the
honey after being operated upon, that the author cannot doubt the
in<U+FB02>uence     of the membrane in effecting the changes registered.
    At this stage of the inquiry an important doubt suggested itself.
In   the above experiments no small importance             has been attached to
the circumstance       of bitterness becoming developed in the various
solutions when      kept in contact with the membrane.              In  every case
indeed the membrane was washed with jealous care, but the fact is
palpable,    that it is almost impossible         to divest   the membrane       of
every trace    of bitterness   ;  when this is eifected as far as practicable,
in  a very few minutes the damp membrane               increases perceptibly     in
bitterness.      When washed, submitted to pressure between folds of
blotting-paper,     stretched    out on a board       and dried    as   rapidly as
possible    in  a current   of warm air, it is still bitter.       May not the
bitterness alluded to in the above cases be attributed              to disintegra
tion of the mucous membrane itself T               The following experiments
seemed    su<U+FB02>iciently simple in their conditions and adapted to answer
the query.       A body was       selected in which well-known molecular
disturbances are easily established—cane-sugar.
    Sugar. December       28.-A     portion of membrane was covered with
a  solution of white      sugar; another      portion,   of the   same    size, was
covered with lukewarm         water, and both were exposed to a tempera
ture   of 32° C.      One hour having elapsed, the watery solution was
just perceptibly bitter, the saccharine solution decidedly so.
    December     29.-The      watery   solution    was rendered      very slightly

                       _____~         137
turbid on the addition of diluted acetic acid; this reagent, however,
threw down a distinct precipitate from the saccharine solution.
    January 5, 1856 (from note-book) .--—“ The mucous membrane
infused in simple water is today looking disintegrated, in layers, the
solution opake and slimy; slightly alkaline, just bitter.          The mucous
membrane in sugar very bitter, perfectly transparent.             I believe that
the diiference    of the mucous membrane,        as infused     in water and in
syrup, appears to be well established.”
    January 9.-“ The sugar solution is perfectly transparent, very
 bitter, very slightly alkaline; the membrane is much swelled out and
 thickened; fresh.      The watery solution is becoming decomposed,
 alkaline,   has lost its bitter taste, very turbid;         the membrane       is
 shrivelled and separating     into layers.     Microscopic examination re
 ferred the turbidness to broken-down        epithelium.”
     The report of the above       series  of experiments       has   been thus
 minutely transcribed,    because   it  seems to place the active agency       of
 the mucous membrane beyond reasonable doubt, so far as the class
 of bodies alluded to is concerned     ;  but principally   because,   as will be
 seen    in the sequel, Pettenkofer’s     method    alone appears to fail in
 some cases as a discriminating     test of the bile.
 Action    of the Mucous   Membrane      of the Gall-bladder     upon Albumen.
     January 27.—“ At      3 P.M. took     a  portion of dry mucous mem
 brane and carefully washed it in several waters        ; it was then plunged
 into the white of an egg.       8 P.M. the glairy <U+FB02>uid is bitter.”
     January   3l.—“The     solution apparently increasing        in bitterness;
  a little water added to supply the loss by evaporation.”
     February 18.—“ The albumen solution has from time to time
  been diluted with water.      Today    I can  barely detect bitterness, nor
 is the colour changed.      On applying Pettenkofer’s         test, the play   of
  colour, supposed to be characteristic of bile, was very distinct in the
  <U+FB02>uid portion; the albumen coagulated by the heat, retaining its
  white colour.”
     This result was perplexing; on the 19th, therefore, an experiment
  was made on the white of an egg, per se, to ascertain whether the
  effect was due to the albumen.        The white of an egg was <U+FB01>rst boiled
  in water, to coagulate the albumen, and the <U+FB01>ltered <U+FB02>uid, containing
  soluble albumen and probably other organic matters, was examined

                                          138
  by Pettenkofer’s method.          On adding strong sulphuric acid the <U+FB02>uid
  underwent     further coagulation, and the liquid portion became of                a
  beautiful rose colour.        It   remains    to be determined       whether    the
  white of the egg contains any of the elements            of the bile, or whether
  Pettenkofer’s   method fails, as a      discriminating test of the bile, in the
  presence   of soluble albumen.
     Having thus established the fact that the mucous membrane of
  the gall-bladder    is capable    of producing changes on the bodies and
  under the circumstances above stated, it became an important object
 of inquiry whether the hepatic <U+FB02>uid proper is capable of being in
 <U+FB02>uenced by its contact; but how are we to isolate this secretion’!
 If  we take a portion of ox-liver, bruise          it down, express the <U+FB02>uid,
 doubtless containing       a large proportion of liver-bile, and place this
 <U+FB02>uid under an exhausted receiver over sulphuric acid,              if in su<U+FB02>icient
 quantity for examination,        it will  be decomposed       before evaporation
 is completed.      The   same    <U+FB02>uid undergoes changes also very rapidly
 at a  slightly elevated temperature.          It was found in fact that from
 the temperature       of 34° C. to about 60° C. putrefaction             is easily
 produced in ox-liver, whereas,         if plunged    into water at the boiling
 point, no considerable       changes     of  a putrefactive     nature occurred.
 Supposing     then we plunge         a very    thin slice of liver into boiling
 water, we at once coagulate the albumen, or rather such portion                of it
 as is insoluble   in boiling water; we break up the hepatic            vessels and
obtain a <U+FB02>uid containing a considerable quantity of hepatic bile.                  It
was found better not to keep up the boiling for any lengthened time,
as the solution,     in that  case, contains     much soluble albumen.          The
liquid then having been allowed to boil for                 a few minutes,      was
removed from the <U+FB01>re and strained through                   a  cloth; the turbid
solution cooled as rapidly as possible; the upper portion poured                  off
from the deposit, and thus experimented upon.
    Diluted acetic acid caused no precipitate, nor was any perceptible
reaction produced by Pettenkofer’s method, which would seem to
indicate that the reaction        observed in the white of the egg was not
occasioned by the presence of albumen.
    December 21,       1855.-As in      the previous cases, a portion of well
washed mucous membrane was covered with the above solution and
exposed to a temperature         of 38° C., 39° C. being considered          as  the
maximum       temperature     of the ox.       In half    an hour, on applying

                    __.___-_             139
    Pettenltofefs        test, the characteristic colour was                beautifully          de
    veloped.
      December       22.—The        solution     last alluded         to wasthis morning
    distinctly yellow, very bitter, and formed              a    precipitate with diluted
    acetic acid.     A musky odour is also perceptible.
      On the 21st of December another portion of membrane was covered
    with the liver-broth and left at the ordinary temperature of the room
    in which the operation was conducted,                 10°    C.     After thirty hours’
    digestion, the <U+FB02>uid was in the slightest               degree       bitter; it was then
    exposed to a temperature of 50° C.               Three hours having elapsed, it
    was again examined and found decidedly bitter.
       December 23.—Cursori1y examined the <U+FB02>uid at 4 P.M.                          ;   it is noted
    down as intensely bitter, becoming yellow, with slight musky odour.
      December 24.—The solution, just undergoing metamorphosis on
    December 21st, was this day found as yellow as a diluted solution of
    ox-gall, musky odour distinct, intensely bitter.                    Another remarkable
    feature in common with ox-gall as it is separated from the bladder
    was now developed         :   on pouring   it intofor precipitation with
                                                          a glass
    acetic acid, it was found glairy, and instead of running off like water
'
    as it did originally, the drops were viscid like a solution of gum
    arabic.     The bitter taste      was   now also converted into a sweetish
    bitter, identical with the organic matter in ox-bile.   The solution
    gave a dense precipitate  with  diluted acetic acid, and the peculiar
    reaction of Pettenkofer’s         test was most satisfactorily exhibited.                      It
    may not      be considered unimportant           to mention, that, on repeating
    these experiments a few days ago, a portion of the solution, treated
    as above, was placed in the hands of a bystander wholly ignorant of
    the matter, with a request to smell without looking at                     it;     the report
    Was,   “You     are    mixing up    some     indian    ink    ;"’   indeed, the odour of
    musk      seems to be one      of the most important conjunctive indications
    of the    presence    of bile, after few hours’ exposure to atmospheric air.
                                       a
      Many more experiments are registered in the author’s rough notes;
    some of these have been repeated within the last few days, all with
    con<U+FB01>rmatory results; the following generalizations therefore appear
    legitimately deduced from the research :—
       lst, That the mucus of the gall-bladder                  is    not merely       a   secretion
    destined to lubricate         the interior    of that organ and protect                 it   from

                                         140
 the irritation of its other contents, but is an essential integral portion
 of the cystic bile.
    2ndly, That the gall-bladder is not merely         a receptacle and reser
 voir for the bile, but an organ highly endowed with organic func
 tions; and that the proper secretion of the liver is converted into
 cystic bile mainly through the agency        of its mucous membrane.
  _ In thus breaking up      the surface  of an interesting <U+FB01>eld of research,
the writer is fully aware that a great amount of labour must still be
expended      upon   its development    ; he would also be understood        to
regard    these experiments     merely as expressing      the results  of non
vital reactions.      We can hardly indeed doubt that, under the in
<U+FB02>uence    of vitality, acting through the medium of that most import
ant department      of the nervous system, the solar plexus, molecular
changes, not improbably analogous to or identical with those which
we have described, may be carried on with an energy and e<U+FB01>iciency
which we cannot         hope   to witness    in the laboratory.      Professor
Clark, of Cambridge,        has already    suggested    the extension   of the
research to the case     of animals which have no gall-bladder, and in
which the hepatic secretion is at once poured into the duodenum, to
take its part in the process     of assimilation.     The conjecture may not
be  far from the truth, that the mucous lining of the intestinal canal,
the parotid gland, the pancreas, the kidney, the urinary bladder, has
each its speci<U+FB01>c predestined function to perform        j and that in working
out the subject, we may fall upon many a useful fact, many a beauti
ful analogy, and much to supply the wants and alleviate the sufferings
of man.

        The LORD WROTTESLEY, President, in the Chair.
      A Special General Meeting was held this day, to consider             a_ pro
  posal    from Her Majestyfs Government to give apartments to the
  Society in Burlington House, contained in the following letter :—
                                            Treasury Chambers, 22nd May, 1856.
     MY LoRn,—I         am   directed by the Lords Commissioners          of Her
  Majesty’s Treasury to acquaint your Lordship, with reference to the
  views set forth in your Letter to the Duke of Argyll of the 30th ult.,
  which has been laid before this Board, that Her Majesty’s Govern

  de<U+FB01>nite views with respect to the project for the juxtaposition of the
 principal Scienti<U+FB01>c Societies in       a  building to   be erected   in a conve
 nient and central locality.
     I have   to state that their Lordships are however         prepared    so far
 to concede to the views advanced by your Lordship on behalf                  of a
 large number      of persons connected with science,      as to allow the tem
 porary location of the Linnean and Chemical Societies, in conjunc
\tion with the Royal Society, in the present building of Burlington
  House, on the following conditions, viz.
     1. That the removal of the Royal Society from Somerset House
 shallnot prejudice the position of the other Societies located in that
 building, in regard to the terms on which they are permitted                   to
 occupy their present apartments.
     2. That the Royal Society shall be put in possession of the main
 building of Burlington House, on the understanding that they will,
 in communication with the Linnean and Chemical Societies, assign
 suitable accommodation        therein for those bodies.
     3. A common      Library to   be formed    for the use of the three Socie
 ties, on the understanding       that suitable arrangements     shall be made
                           ‘

  for the admission thereto, for purposes of reference and study, of
  men of letters and science, on orders given by Fellows of the three              i
  Societies*.
      4. The Societies to be allowed the use of the           Hall which it is pro
  posed to construct         in the West Wing of Burlington House, at such
  times as it may not be required by the Senate of the University of
  London, it being distinctly understood that this permission is to be
  so exercised as not in any way to interfere with the convenience
                                                                                     of
  the University.
      5. The Collection of Portraits belonging           to the Royal Society to
  be hung on the walls          of the proposed Hall, and to        be open to the
  inspection     of the public under such regulations        as may be convenient,
  and subject especially to the proviso in the preceding clause.
      6.  That the adoption of this temporary arrangement shall not in
  any respect he held to weaken the claim of the Royal Society to
  permanent accommodation.

   To the President of the Royal Society.
      The President having            stated to the Meeting the circumstances
   under which the o<U+FB01>'er          of Burlington House had been made to the
   Royal Society by Her Majesty’s Government, Sir Benjamin Brodie,
   Bart., V.P., proposed the following Resolution :
       “ That the Council be authorized to accept and carry out the pro
   posal of the Government as to the occupation of Burlington House,
   on the understanding that the Hall, which it is proposed to construct
   in the West Wing, and which is to contain the Portraits belonging to
.  the'Roy~al Society, shall be placed in the custody of the Royal
      * The President stated, that he had intimated to the Secretary of the Treasury
   that, in his opinion, the Council would understand the third condition in the
  foregoing letter as implying the mutual access to the three libraries by the Fellows
   of the three Societies for the purposes of reference and study, but not as altering
   in any respect the ownership or custody of the several Libraries; and that in
   future, as heretofore, the loan of the books of any of the three libraries should
   be con<U+FB01>ned to the Fellows of that Society to which they belong.      The President
   further stated, that Mr. Wilson assented to the above explanation of the minute,
   so far as it relates to the formation of a common library.

        in the University of              Cambridge.—Part           II.   Received
        June 7, 1856.

                                  The Quartz Weight
     The hardness of quartz, its capability of taking           a   high polish, the
absence      of any hygroscopic properties, and its indestructibility at the
ordinary temperature of the atmosphere by any chemical agent ex
eept hydro<U+FB02>uoric acid, are such valuable qualities in a substance
used for the construction          of weights, that Professor Steinheil adopted
it   as the material   for   a   copy of the kilogramme.     The only objection
to the use of       a weight      made   of quartz   is,   that on account of the
large amount of air displaced,           the barometer and thermometer must
          with extreme care during its comparison with weight
be observed                                                                a
made of any ordinary metal.  The Committee commissioned Mr.
Barrow to construct   weight of quartz su<U+FB02>iciently near to 7000 grs,
                         a
to admit of readily deducing the pound from it.   Its form   that of      is
a cube of about 2'2 inches, having its edges and angles rounded.

Its apparent weight in air is intermediate between that of                 a pound
of platinum and a pound         of brass, approaching more nearly to the
latter than to the former.
    Six series of weighings in water gave for the absolute weights of
water displaced by    it at  18° C.—

  He observes, that, unlike the methods employed in his former me
  moir, and the solutionsthere employed, which are quite rigorous,
  the methods of the present memoir                       depend upon developments into
  series,  the strictness of which has been contested by some mathema
  ticians; but that passing over these di<U+FB02>iculties, he has solved the
  famous problem, the solution of which has been vainly sought after
  for the last two hundred years, because on the above-mentioned
  equation depends the integration                   of the generally linear equation of
  any order whatever               of two variables, and consequently the whole
  Integral Calculus.              The solution <U+FB01>rst obtained by the author, and
  which he afterwards exhibits under a variety of different forms, is as

      MY DEAR Sm,-—Will you do                me the favour to announce to the
   Royal Society, that    I  have been engaged during some time past in
/_;the  application  of my discovery of the optical properties of iodo
  strychnia to the detection of this alkaloid in medico-legal               inquiries?
  I  <U+FB01>nd it is perfectly     possible to recognize         the 10,000th      part of a
  grain    of strychnia in pure solutions by this method,                  even  when
  experimenting     on very minute quantities.           In  one experiment     I took
  T5153-th  of a grain only, and having produced ten crystals of nearly
  equal size, of course each one, possessing distinct and decided optical
  properties,    could not represent more than the <U+FB01>%Wth part of a
  grain; in fact, it really represents much less, inasmuch as one por
  tion   of the strychnia is converted by substitution into                  a soluble
  hydriodate, and of course remains dissolved in the liquid.
      I had hoped to have been able to complete this matter during
  this summer, but I now <U+FB01>nd it impossible to do so in time for this
  session   of the Royal Society.           I   trust to be able to do       so before
   Christmas, however.         Will    you     oblige   me by getting      this notice
   inserted in the ‘Proceedings,’       as a new test    for strychnia at this junc
   ture possesses   considerable      interest,    the colour-tests having been so
   dubiously spoken of recently by toxicologists '!
    g In order to operate
                                in this experiment, it is merely necessary to
   use diluted spirit of wine, about in the.proportions of one part of spirit

                                         150
 to three of water, as the solvent medium, and to employ the smallest
 possible    quantity of the tincture of iodine as the reagent, and after
 applying heat for a short time, to set in repose. On spontaneous
 evaporation or cooling,       the optical    crystals   deposit themselves, and
 may be recognized        by the polarizing microscope, according               to the
 description    given  of this substance in      a former-notice      to the Society
 in June last.
     You may remember that this proposition was also contained in
 my paper on iodo-strychnia, which was withdrawn from the Royal
 Society by me in      June last in consequence of         a necessity    for revision
 and the completion       of experiments requisite to settle the formula of
 that peculiar substance, and the ~introduction of an abstract of the
 literature concerning it.

 IV. “ Dynamical Illustrations of the Magnetic                   and the Helicoi
         dal  Rotatory Effects of Transparent               Bodies on Polarized
         Light.”     By Professor W. THOMSON, F.R.S.                        Received
         May 10, 1856.
     The elastic reaction       of a homogeneously strained solid has a
 character essentially devoid of all helicoidal and of all dipolar asym
 metry. Hence the rotation of the plane of polarization of light
 passing through bodies‘ which either intrinsically possess the helicoi
 dal property (syrup, oil of turpentine,- quartz crystals, &c.), or have the
 magnetic property induced in them, must be due to elastic reactions
 dependent on the heterogeneousness            of the strain through the space
 of  a wave, or to some       heterogeneousness of the luminous motions*
 dependent on a heterogeneousness             of parts of the matter of lineal
 dimensions     not in<U+FB01>nitely small in comparison           with the wave length.
_An in<U+FB01>nitely homogeneous          solid could      not possess     either   of those
    * As would  be were there different sets of vibrating particles, or were Rankine’s
 important hypothesis true, that the vibrations of luminifc1'ous  particles are directly
 affected by pressure of a surrounding  medium in virtue of its inertia.

                                                151
properties      if       the stress at any point        of it was in<U+FB02>uenced only by
parts    of the body touching it; but if the stress at                       one   point      is
directly in<U+FB02>uenced             by the strain in parts at distances from it <U+FB01>nite
in comparison with the wave length, the helicoidal property might
exist, and the rotation of the plane of polarization, such as is observed
in many liquids and in quartz crystals, could be explained as a direct
dynamical       consequence of the statical               elastic reaction    called       into
play by such a strain as exists in a wave of polarized light.                        It   may,
however, be considered more probable that the matter                       of transparent
bodies is really heterogeneous from one part to another                       of lineal di
mensions not in<U+FB01>nitely small in comparison with a wave length, than
that it is in<U+FB01>nitely homogeneous and has the property of exerting
<U+FB01>nite direct “ molecular” force at distances comparable with the
wave length          :   and   it is certain that any spiral heterogeneousness of a
vibrating      medium must,           if   either right-handed or left-handed spirals
predominate, cause a <U+FB01>nite rotation of the plane                   of polarization of all
waves  of which lengths are not in<U+FB01>nitely great multiples of the steps
of the structural spirals. Thus a liquid <U+FB01>lled homogeneously with
spiral <U+FB01>bres, or a solid with spiral passages   through it of steps not
less    than the forty-millionth of an inch, or a crystal with a right
handed or a left-handed geometrical arrangement of parts of some such
lineal dimensions as the forty-millionth                of an inch, might     be certainly
expected to cause either a right-handed or a left-handed rotation of
ordinary light (the wave length being                   <U+FB01>x-nth
                                                                 of an inch for homoge
neous yellow).
   But the magnetic in<U+FB02>uence on light discovered by Faraday depends
on the direction of motion of moving particles.      For instance, in a
medium possessing               it,
                       particles in  straight line parallel to the lines
                                                    a
of magnetic force, displaced to     helix round this line as axis, and
                                                a
then projected tangentially with such velocities as to describe circles,
will have di<U+FB02>erent velocities according                  as   their motions are round in
one direction (the same as the nominal direction of the galvanic cur
rent in the magnetizing coil), or in the contrary direction. But the
elastic reaction of the medium must be the same for the same dis
placements, whatever be the velocities and directions of the particles                        ;
that    is   to say, the forces which are balanced by centrifugal force of
the circular motions are equal, while the luminiferous                        motions        are
unequal.         The        absolute       circular motions      being   therefore        either

                                             152
     equal or such as to transmit        equal centrifugal   forces to the particles
     initially considered, it follows that the luminiferous motions are only
     components of the whole motion ; and that a less luminiferous com
     ponent in one direction, compounded with a motion existing in the
‘
     medium when transmitting no light, gives an equal resultant to that
     of  a greater    luminiferous motion        in the contrary    direction    com
     pounded with the same non-luminous motion.               I think  it is not only
    impossible to conceive any other than this dynamical explanation of
    the fact that      circularly polarized    light transmitted     through mag
    netized glass parallel to the lines of magnetizing force, with the same
    quality, right-handed always, or left-handed always, is propagated at
    diiferent rates according as its course is in the direction or is contrary
    to the direction       in which    a  north magnetic pole is drawn; but          I
    believe   it can  be demonstrated that no other explanation          of that fact
    is possible.       Hence    it appears that      Faraday’s optical      discovery
    affords a demonstration        of the reality of Ampere’s explanation of the
    ultimate    nature   of magnetism ; and gives a de<U+FB01>nition of magnetiza
   tion in the dynamical theory of heat. The introduction of the prin
   ciple of moments of momenta (“the conservation of areas”) into
   the mechanical treatment of Mr. Bankine’s hypothesis of “ molecular
   vortices,” appears to indicate a line perpendicular          to the plane of re
   sultant rotatory momentum            (“the invariable plane ”) of the thermal
   motions as the magnetic axis of a magnetized body, and suggests the
   resultant moment of momenta of these motions as the de<U+FB01>nite mea
   sure of the “ magnetic moment.”             The explanation of all phenomena
   of electro-magnetic attraction or repulsion, and of electro-magnetic
   induction, is to be looked for simply in the inertia and pressure of
   the matter      of which the motions constitute          heat.    Whether this
  matter is or is not electricity,        whether  it is a continuous    <U+FB02>uid inter
  permeating       the spaces between molecular nuclei, or is itself molecu
  larly grouped; or whether all matter iscontinuous, and molecular
  heterogeneousness consists in <U+FB01>nite vortical or other relative motions
  of contiguous parts of         a  body; it is impossible to decide, and per
  haps in vain to speculate, in the present state of science.
       I append    the solution     of a dynamical   problem for the sake      of the
  illustrations it suggests for the two kinds of effect on theplane of

       Amides and Nitriles, with Remarks on the Conjugate
       Sulpho-acids.”      By Gnonon B. BucK'roN, Esq., F.L.S.,
       F.C.S.,   and A. W. HOFMANN, Ph.D., F.R.S.                 Received
       May 13, 1856.
                                 (Abstract.)
    Since we had the honour of addressing          the Royal Society upon
the subject   of the behaviour of acetamide and acetonitrile towards
sulphuric acid, we have completed our experiments upon the amides
and nitriles, and extended our researches to other groups of bodies.
The results of these additional inquiries we now beg to present in the
form of a second short summary, the analytical details and the more
extended description    of the new compounds being given in the com
plete memoir, which, at the same time, we have the honour of sub
 mitting to the Society.
    Before  proceeding, however, to give an account of our new com
pounds, it may be desirable to state that several considerations,       sug
 gested by the progress     of our inquiry, have induced us <U+FB01>nally to
 adopt the name of Disulphometholic acid instead of the provisional
 term Tetrasulphomethylic acid under which we have described,              in
 our <U+FB01>rst communication,     the new acid generated by the action     of sul
 phuric acid upon acetamide and acetonitrile.
                              ETHYL-SERIES.
             Action   of Sulphuric Acid    upon Propionitrile.
    Considerable   di<U+FB01>iculty is experienced in preparing this nitrile in     a

                                       159
state   of purity.    It  was <U+FB01>nally obtained by acting upon propion
amide with anhydrous phosphoric           acid.
 _  When three parts by measure of the nitrile are cautiously mixed
with two parts of fuming sulphuric acid, and heat is applied, the
liquids enter into a sort of ebullition,       carbonic  acid being copiously
evolved;     at the same time a portion of propionic acid passes into
the receiver, the amount        of which may      be lessened by raising    the
temperature only gradually.
   At the close of the operation         a tenacious mass     is found  in the‘
retort, which, when dissolved in water and neutralized with carbonate
of barium, furnishes two rather soluble but readily crystallizable salts,
very di<U+FB02>icult to separate one from the other.             Their isolation may
be conveniently     effected, by converting them into the corresponding
ammoniacal       compounds,     by precipitating their solution with car
bonate     of ammonium.
    The <U+FB01>ltrate yields two substances,       one  of which crystallizes, while
the other is quite uncrystallizable.
   The latter substance, when long digested with carbonate of barium,
produces crystals of a barium-salt       whose analysis gives numbers lead

    This substance is obviously sulphopropionate          of barium, the com
pound next in series to the sulphacetate discovered by           M. Melsens.
    It  is generally deposited from its solution in <U+FB01>ne silky crystals,
which arrange themselves in spherical groups. They are very stable,
and bear a high temperature without decomposition.
    The salt associated with the uncrystallizable sulphopropionate of
ammonium crystallizes with case, either in rectangular prisms or
in octohedra.       Similarly converted into      a barium-compound,     it was
found by analysis to contain at 100° C.,
                          C4 (H4 Baz)   S4 012  + 2H0.
    It  forms regular six-sided plates, which are moderately soluble in
water, but insoluble      in alcohol and in ether.        It loses two equiva
lents    of water of crystallization    between 100° and 170°, but a few
degrees above this temperature          it is decomposed with blackening,
yielding water, sulphurous        acid, volatile organic products,    and sul
phate    of barium.                             .
    We designate this salt     as disulphetholate    of barium.
                                                                 P 2

                                       160
   Disulphetholic acid is prepared by precipitating a solution of the
barium-salt with sulphuric acid, the excess of which is again removed
by digestion with oxide of lead, and subsequent treatment with sul
phuretted hydrogen.         It is a crystalline and stable compound, very
acid to the taste, and very deliquescent.           With oxide of lead, or
with carbonate of silver, it readily forms the respective salts, both
of which are crystalline.
   After what has been said with reference to the action of sulphuric
acid upon acetamide,      it is scarcely necessary to remark that the sul
phopropionates      and disulphetholates    may be prepared with equal, or
even greater   facility from propionamide.        Care, however,     should be
taken to use the amide in a perfectly dry state, which prevents in
great measure the formation        of free propionic acid.
                               PROPYL-SERIES.
              Action    of Sulphuric Acid     upon Butyramide.
   Equal parts by volume of melted butyramide and Nordhausen
sulphuric acid evolve much heat when mixed together.                In the re
action two acids are eliminated,       showing that the series bears a strict
analogy with the deportment exhibited by the preceding group.
   As the ammonia-salts of these acids are wholly uncrystallizable,
their separation is almost impossible.          The barium-compounds also
are scarcely to be obtained of a        de<U+FB01>nite form, so that it is a matter
of great di<U+FB02>iculty to procure salts of suf<U+FB01>cient purity for exact esti
mation.     Recourse was had to fractional       precipitation   by alcohol.
   The <U+FB01>rst salt which was deposited formed minute grains, which
adhered strongly to the sides       of the glass vessel containing the solu
tion.   It gave a    percentage of barium which unmistakeably indicated
the formula
                               08 (H6 B32)  S2 010,
which is that of sulphobutyrate of barium.
   This substance in its reactions closely resembles (with the excep
tion of its greater solubility in water) the corresponding body of the
ethyl-series.    It  burns like tinder, with evolution of sulphurous       acid,
and leaves a residue     of sulphite and sulphate of barium.         The aque
ous solution presents a gummy mass on evaporation.
   A further    addition of alcohol to the mother-liquor       of the sulpho
 butyrate  of barium      throws down     a <U+FB02>occulent    precipitate, which is

                                                   161
very soluble in water.              It    was puri<U+FB01>ed by repeated and partial pre
cipitation with alcohol.                 This substance, when dried at                   a tempera
ture   of 165° C., furnished upon analysis numbers agreeing with the
expression                               0'6   (H6 Baa)   S4.   012’
which     is   that   of disulphopropiolate           of barium.

                  Action     of Sulphuric Acid            upon Benzonitrile.
  From the results obtained in the study of the methyl-, ethyl-, and
propyl-series, we may fairly infer that all the homologues of other
groups will exhibit          a   similar deportment.
  It   appeared, however, desirable to extend our researches to                              a   class
of bodies which             are analogous          (not homologous)               to the preceding
series.
  Sulphuric acid appears to act with much                              less energy upon benzo
nitrile or cyanide of phenyl than upon the foregoing nitriles. No evo
lution of gas     observed until the mixture of the two substances
                      is                                                                            is
strongly heated, and then so much sulphurous                               acid    is   formed from
charringof the cyanide that its presenceiis almost entirely masked.
  The digestion was continued for two hours, after which the dark
residue was treated in the usual manner for the soluble barium-salts.

  An examination of the mother-liquor proved, as we had antici

    The question naturally suggested itself, whether              the same   acid
 could not be prepared directly from the hydrocarbon              benzol.
    Mitscherlich has already described an acid (the sulphobenzolic)
 in which one equivalent of that hydrocarbon              is associated with one
 equivalent of bibasic sulphuric acid.         We have proved by experiment
 that sulphobenzolic   acid takes up the elements of an additional equi
 valent when   it is submitted to the prolonged action of N ordhausen
 sulphuric acid, and that, in fact, the union of these two bodies pre
 sents the most ready method of procuring disulphobenzolic acid in a
state of purity.                             .
    The preceding researches establish in two different groups of
bodies the existence of a series of bibasic acids containing four equi
valents of sulphur, and which, irrespectively             of any special view re
garding their molecular     arrangement,        may be represented as formed
by the association of the hydrocarbon (corresponding to marsh-gas)

   An   acid of analogous composition          exists in the naphthalin-series,
disulphonaphtholic acid, C,0 H8 4SO3, which was discovered by Ber
zelius, and subsequently studied by Laurent.                Many of these sub
stances may be actually obtained directly from the hydrocarbons               by
the action of sulphuric acid.
   On the other hand, chemists      are well acquainted         with the deport
ment of ole<U+FB01>ant gas under the in<U+FB02>uence           of anhydrous sulphuric acid.
The crystalline compound discovered by Magnus, and described by
him under the name of sulphate of carbyl, whatever its constitution
may be, can be considered as a direct combination                of ole<U+FB01>ant gas,
with four equivalents of anhydrous sulphuric acid,—
                Sulphate  of carbyl . . . . . . . . C4  H4 4SO3.

substances.

  lates two equivalents, and is converted       into a bibasic acid _(ethiouic),
  C4  H 4 4SO3 + 2HO = C4       H6 02 4SO3, which accordingly          may    be
  viewed as an association of alcohol with four equivalents           of anhy
  drous sulphuric acid.       Terms analogous to ethionic acid are sure to
  be   found when the study of the homologues of sulphate of carbyl
  shall be taken up by chemists.
     The production     of disulpho-compounds        of perfectly similar com
  position, from substances belonging to such different groups of bodies,
  as  the hydrocarbons     homologous and analogous to marsh-gas, ethy
  lene and alcohol, suggested the     possibility that the substances in ques
  tion might be    but individual examples illustrating a far more general
  mode    of formation.      It became, in fact, probable that all organic
  bodies capable of uniting with the elements of two equivalents of
  anhydrous    sulphuric acid might, under favourable circumstances, be
  induced to assimilate two additional        equivalents   of anhydrous     sul
  phuric acid, and thus furnish other terms belonging to the class of
  disulpho-compounds.
     The only additional      class of compounds to which       we have as yet
  successfully extended our labours, is the group of organic bases.
                   Action  of Sulphuric Acid     upon Aniline.
     The <U+FB01>rst     product    which sulphuric acid forms with aniline           is
  simply the sulphate of the base.
     A further addition of acid, assisted by heat, dissolves the sulphate,
  and after a su<U+FB02>iciently long digestion, the whole is converted            into
  sulphanilic acid.     If  too high a temperature be employed, the acid
  becomes very dark in colour;        and indeed there is a limit beyond
  which carbon is rapidly deposited, accompanied by the evolution of
                                                                                ‘
  abundance    of sulphuric acid.
-
     The process of converting      sulphanilic acid into the disulpho-com
  pound is rather tedious.        It may, however, be effected without fail,
  by treating for several hours the perfectly dry crystalline acid, mixed
  with strong Nordhausen acid, to the consistence of a paste. The
  heat should not exceed that at which sulphurous acid just com
  mences to be evolved.        We employed an air-bath heated from 160°
  to 170° C., and the digestion was continued until a portion removed
  by a glass    r_od showed no trace of crystallization        when cooled or
  moistened with water.

                                      164
    Treatment with carbonate of barium yielded in this manner           a   very
soluble salt, which furnished a brittle gum when evaporated.                 The
new substance was precipitated         from   its solution    by alcohol and
dried at 200° C.        A  determination   of the barium and the sulphur
led to the expression
                                                                           l

which is the formula of disulphanilate of barium.
    This salt is readily attacked by concentrated nitric acid with oxi
dation of the sulphur.         It blackens  when    strongly   heated on pla
tinum foil, and yields sulphurous acid without in<U+FB02>aming, a deport
ment in which it differs from sulphanilate of barium, which burns
with    a bright <U+FB02>ame. When heated in close vessels it forms             a   cry
stalline sublimate, which consists of sulphite of aniline.
     Disulphanilic acid is prepared by decomposing the lead-salt with
 hydrosulphuric acid.        It is very soluble in water, and crystallizes
 with di<U+FB01>iculty.      It  may be precipitated      from    a  strong  aqueous
 solution by alcohol in the form      of white grains.      The precipitation
 is assisted by the addition of a little ether.     It  has a very rough and
 acid taste.
    We have also prepared the silver-salt by saturating the acid with
 carbonate of silver.      The most ready method of obtaining it in a
 solid state is by precipitation with alcohol and ether.          The aqueous
 solution,    by concentration, deposits a black powder which makes it
 very dit<U+FB01>cult to obtain the crystals colourless.
     The formula of disulphanilate of silver is
                            C12  (H5 A82)  N S4 012
     The potassa-salt is crystalline. It forms small grains or minute
 needles, which are insoluble in alcohol.
     The researches detailed in the preceding paragraphs may           serve to
  characterize    more fully a class  of compounds of which only          a few
  terms, isolated   and scattered in widely different       groups,  had been
  previously observed.      The only disulpho-acids hitherto known, are
  Be1_'zelius’s and Laurent’s disulphonaphthalic acid, Magnus’s ethionic
  (disulphethylic) acid, and lastly, dithiobenzic acid, recently discovered
  by M. Kilkenkamp.        To these we now add <U+FB01>ve new acids, belonging
  to several of the most important series of compounds :-—

    Our experiments point out, moreover, the universal occurrence,
and the general mode    of formation of        these substances.         All organic
molecules, particularly in the nascent state, appear to be capable                of
assimilating  the elements   of either two or four equivalents of anhy
drous acid.
    The formation of the two groups of acids which are thus produced
presents a great analogy with the production of the nitro-substitutes
generated under the influence of nitric acid.                  All these compounds
are generated with the elimination        of water.          In the action of nitric

    The analogy of [these reactions is obvious.
     The action of nitric acid upon organic bodies is by no means
 limited to the production of nitro-compounds                      corresponding   to
 nitrobenzol and dinitrobenzol; frequently additional substitutes are
 formed with elimination of six, eight, and in a few isolated cases,
 even   of ten equivalents of water.             It    is possible    that analogous
  sulpho-compounds     may   exist.      Hitherto, however, no substances
 have been observed in which the assimilation                  of sulphuric acid has
 gone further than in the disulpho-acids.

VI. “ On       Quantitative    Measurement         in Statical Electricity,
      and on some new Phenomena of Electrical Force.” By Sir
      W1LL1AM SNOW HARRIS,            F.R.S.      Received June 12, 1856.
                                 (Abstract.)
   The author observes, that number, weight, and measure are the
foundation   of all exact science,   and that, as expressed by an eminent
and learned writer         Quetelet),    no branch     of human     knowledge
can be held as being out of its infancy which does not in some way
or the other frame its theories or correct its practice by reference to
those elements; he was hence led to seek and establish such rigorous
and exact quantitative processes in common electricity as would mea
sure the quantity of electricity in operation       ; its attractive or repul
sive force under given conditions,      and its dynamical or current force
when traversing bodies under the form of electrical discharge.             The
instruments   which he has invented for this purpose have been all
honoured by a place in the ‘ Philosophical Transactions of the Royal
Society.’    They amount to <U+FB01>ve in number, viz. the Unit Measure,
the Balance and Hydrostatic Electrometers,         the Thermo-electrometer,
and the Bi<U+FB01>lar Balance.       In   referring to such    of these instruments
as are employed     in the present research, the author brie<U+FB02>y adverts
to their general construction,       including the latest and best form
under which they have been placed.
   In  the measurement of quantity,       he considers the unit measure as
being the best   and_ most accurate means of estimating quantity as yet
arrived  at; and he describes   a series  of crucial experiments, the object
of which is to show that the unit explosions are rigorously exact.           If
an electrical jar exposing about     5 square feet of coated surface be in
sulated, and a second equal and similar        jar be so placed as to charge
from its outer coating, and if the <U+FB01>rst jar be charged from the con
ductor of the machine through the unit measure, it is found by a
Lane’s discharging     electrometer attached to each jar, that an equal
number of measures are given off from the outer coating              of the in
sulated jar at    all periods of the progress of the charge.             Thus,
whether    the <U+FB01>rst jar be charged with 20, or 40, or 60 measures,

                                      167
it still evolves from its outer coating the same number of measures
for each unit of quantity as it did at <U+FB01>rst; and conversely, the
second   jar receives   as easily the  unit of quantity taken in terms of
the   unit  explosions when charged with 20, 40, or 60 measures, as
it did at <U+FB01>rst.    The author concludes, that the charging of an elec
trical jar is by    a rough analogy rather to be associated with the
pouring of an inelastic <U+FB02>uid such          as water   into an open    vessel   in
measured     quantities, which is done up to the point           of over<U+FB02>ow    as
easily at last as at the <U+FB01>rst.
    Having given experimental illustrations of the nature of the           seve
ral instruments     just adverted to, and shown their accuracy           as   in
struments     of research, the paper proceeds to consider the pheno
mena of what the author, after the learned Mr. Cavendish, deno
miuates electrical charge.       By the term electrical charge of a given
conducting substance, the author understands the quantity of elec
tricity which the body can sustain under a given degree of the
electrometer.     In pursuing this    interesting    question, he commences
with an examination       of the charges of hollow spheres or globes of
different diameters.      The method of experiment is to place the given
sphere in communication       with the electrometer, and <U+FB01>nd by a transfer
of measured quantities of electricity the precise number of measures
required to bring the index to        a given     degree of the arc.     These
measures are obtained by insulated          balls or plates of given dimen
sions, brought into contact with the ball of an insulated charged             jar
carefully prepared and screened from the external air.              The author
shows how this method of measuring            quantity by means of what he
terms a quantity-jar may be perfected, so as to be relied on as a means
of estimating small quantities of electricity.
    The results of a series of experiments with spheres and plates of
equal area led to the deduction, that the charges           of these bodies are
 as the square roots   of the surfaces multiplied into the circumferences,
 and that the charge of a sphere is to the charge of a circular plate of
 equal surface as I : 4/5, and the charge of a great circle of a sphere
 is to the charge   of the sphere  as  1 :  4/Z, or  1 : 2.
    Taking   a given surface   of 100 square inches, and placing it under
 various forms, viz. a sphere, circular plate, square plate, rectangular
 plates  of variable extension,    a  hollow open cylinder,       a cube,    &c.,
 and subjecting    these to the same process of experiment          by which is

                                          168
measured the quantity        of electricity which each can sustain under a
given degree     of the electrometer or what the author calls intensity,
he deduces the following        :
    1. The charges of spheres and circular planes,                 as also   of plane
rectangular plates, are as the square roots           of these surfaces multiplied
into their circumferences or perimeters.
    2. The charge      of a cylinder is      as the square root        of its surface
multiplied into the sum of its length and circumference.
    3. The charge of a cube is as the square root of its surface mul
tiplied into twice its side.
    4. The charge       of  a sphere     is to the charge of one          of its great
circles as  2:   l.
    5. The charge of a sphere is to the charge of a plane circle of
equal surface as     l  : Vi or    as  l  : 1'41.
    6. The charge      of a cube is to the charge of             a sphere    of equ
surface as   l :  1'47 nearly.
                                                                                    ~
    7. The charge of       a square plate is to the charge         of  a cube whose
sideequals the side of the square           as l  : 1'6 nearly.
    8. The charge      of a circular plate is to the charge of         a square plate
whose side equals the diameter of the circle as              1 : 1'28.
    The author examines the charges of cylindrical rods or tubes of
small diameter, and <U+FB01>nds their capacity to be nearly as the length,
 the surface being constant; being quite in accordance with the result
 arrived at by Volta, who found that an insulated conductor com
 posed  of gilded rods could receive under the same intensity                as  much
 electricity  as   would produce       a shock      equal to a given extent         of
 coated glass.
    In referring to the beautiful experiments             of Coulomb, the author
 conceives that the sharing       of electricity between       a  circular plate and
 sphere of equal area, in proportion to the two surfaces                 of the plate
 to the one exterior surface      of the sphere, is     a different   thing from the
 absolute charging      of the plate on two surfaces, and adduces experi
 ments to show that when a circular plate charges on both its surfaces,
it takes up twice the quantity of electricity under the same intensity,
 which a plane circular plate in respect of a sphere of equal area does
 not; he conceives the sharing of electricity between                   a sphere   and
 circular plate of equal area to be a pure result of the inductive sus
 ccptibility of the plate in consequence of the free exposure of its

entire surface;     he further gives some new experiments on induction,
with a view of proving that when one surface is opposed as it were
to itself, as in the case of the interior surface of a phere, the induc
tive susceptibility    of one-half the surface is reduced to zero.           The
phenomena       of what the author calls, after Cavendish,             electrical
charge, he refers to some peculiar arrangement or disposition             of the
electrical particles on the surfaces of the several conductors, by which
they exhibit    a greater or less degree     of excitement,   as observable    by
the electrometer.

     The remaining     portion of this paper is devoted to the laws and
phenomena of electrical        attractive  force.   The attractive force of     a
given surface under a given charge does not depend on the quantity
of electricity,‘ but on the number of attracting points called into
operation by what is usually considered as the attracted body.              Two
circular discs of     very light wood, of 5 inches diameter, being care
fully prepared in a lathe, were divided into six concentric rings,
including a central plate of about an inch in diameter. The attract
 ive force on each pair of rings was determined by means of the
 electrical  balance and carefully noted; the force was as the several
 opposed areas    ; and when the series was combined into one plate, the
 force was the sum      of the forces of the respective rings; when the
 attractive forces of circular plates equal in area to the several rings
 respectively were examined, the force was the same as that exhibited
 by the two rings whose       area was the same;      hence  it is inferred that
 whether the charge operates from the circumference or near the
 centre, the attractive force is the same. Two rings combined exhibit
 forces equal to the sum        of the forces taken separately;        and when
 the force is examined between the plates or the several rings and a
 plane circular area    of large and continuous surface, the forces are no
  greater than that between two plates or rings of equal area.             When
  the distances between the attracting surfaces or the quantities          of the
  electrical accumulation varied, then the force was as the square of the
  accumulation    directly, and   as the square   of the distances inversely.
      The author extends -these experiments to spheres of different
  diameters. He had shown in a former paper, that, taking the attract
  ive force to be as the areas directly, and as the squares of the

regularly increased, and the radii of which were from                              1   to 2 inches
in diameter.         These were examined by the electrical balance.                            They

sures of electricity were as the opposed areas, thus con<U+FB01>rming the
preceding       results deduced with plane surfaces;                       when the distances
were varied, the force varied as the squares of the distances between

   The author has examined at various times and with very rigid at
tention, the several conditions under which electrical attractive force
conforms to the law of force as deduced by Cavendish and Coulomb,
and other eminent philosophers,               and he <U+FB01>nds this law true only for
charged and neutral conductors of large inductive capacity;                              if   either
of the attracting         surfaces have      a    narrow or limited susceptibility                    of

                                          171
inductive charge, then this law of force no longer obtains.                   If, for
example, the attracting plates be taken as mere planes of small thick
ness, and even        although they be charged with opposite electricity,
still in changing the distances between them we do not obtain at all
distances a law      of force in the inverse duplicate ratio of the distance
such as we have found to obtain in other circumstances.                 The force
will be commonly in an inverse simple ratio of the distance.                 If   the
neutral or suspended plane be taken very thin and insulated, then
little or no attractive force is observable under any circumstances.
If   we continue      to increase its thickness,      then, as the author         has
shown      in former papers*, attractive force begins to display itself,
and will approach a law of change in the inverse duplicate ratio of
the distance as we extend its dimensions.                When we give it unli
mited     electrical   extension     by placing it in communication with the
ground, then the force is as the square of the distance inversely; but
it is not always so, until we e<U+FB01>'ect this extension perfectly.                When
all these sources of disturbance are duly considered, it will not be
 di<U+FB01>icult to reconcile the many con<U+FB02>icting results arrived at by several
 eminent philosophers         in past times, in their endeavours to investigate
 the law     of electrical force, and explain how, without any defect in
their experimental processes, such con<U+FB02>icting results might arise.
Volta, for example, found electrical force to vary in a simple inverse
 ratio   of the distance.       M. Simon, of Berlin, an eminent philosopher,
and eulogized by Gilbert as being           “ remarkable for   his dexterity and
 careful manipulation”          in this branch     of physics, failed to verify
 Coulomb’s result, although he employed                a new and very delicate
 apparatus,     by which the repulsive         force between two     spheres was
 very accurately and beautifully measured.              In these experiments he
 found the force to vary         as the distance inversely1-.

                                  (Abstract.)
  The author’s object in this paper      is   to state his own case        of colour
blindness, which he believes to be one of the most decided on record;
to compare   itwith others of the same kind; and to show that the
general phenomena attending this defect of vision are more uniform
and consistent, as well as more easy of explanation, than   generally is
supposed.
   For general information on the subject, reference  made to   is                a
work lately published by Dr. Wilson of Edinburgh, entitled “ Re
searches on Colour-Blindness,” in which  great number of cases are
                                                a
fully described, and the optical      and physiological theories             of the
defect carefully   discussed.

                                         178
    After stating reasons which justify          a  colour-blind person under
taking the investigation and descriptionbf his own               case, the author
gives a preliminary statement           of his views in regard to the general
theory and nomenclature‘ of colours, adopting the ordinary hypo
thesis that red, blue, and yellow are the three primaries; a theory
which, though it has been lately called in question, receives, it is
considered, new support from the phenomena of the defect of vision
under consideration.
    Dr. Wilson describes colour-blindness          as  of three kinds,  namely——
    1.  Inability to discern any colour except black and white.                This
                                                                                  '
       is very rare.
    2.  Inability     to   discriminate   between    the   nicer  distinctions    of
       colour.       This is  so common as to be apparently       rather the rule
       than the exception.
    3. The third variety is the only one here treated of.             Its outward
       manifestation is the inability to distinguish between many of the
       colours most marked to normal eyes, and its most complete form
       is what is called olichromic vision;         being total blindness to one
       of the three primary colours.
    The description        of a case  of colour-blindness     may either be con
<U+FB01>ned     to a statement of what may be called the symptoms                  of  the
malady, i. e. the effects        it produces on the individual’sjudgment'of
colours    ;  or  it may go further, and ehdeavour to describe the positive
nature -of the sensations experienced, the causes, so to speak, of the
outward symptoms observed.              The <U+FB01>rst is the plan usually adopted,
but the author combines both in the account of his own case.
   As regards the outward symptoms, he <U+FB01>nds them very similar to
those of other cases; and for the purpose of showing this similarity,
he collects     in an appendix the principal features of nearly forty pub
lished cases, and points out that as a general rule he can corroborate
the whole from his own impressions, the points where they appear
to differ being very few and exceptional.
   An abstract is then given of the symptoms exhibited,               as collected
from these cases.          They are as follows :—
   Blue and yellow are perfectly            distinguished,    and   are  the only
       colours seen      in the spectrum.
    Almost all colour-blind persons think they             see red, but it is fre
       quently      confounded     with green (the most common mistake),

      black, orange, yellow, brown, blue and violet.                  Crimson and pink
      appear to have no relation to scarlet.
    Green is a most perplexing colour;            it is not only confounded with
      red, but with black, white, or grey, orange, yellow, blue, violet
      and brown.
    Violet is confounded with blue or grey; and orange with yellow.
    More di<U+FB01>iculty is manifested with light or dark tones of compound
       colours than with       full ones.
    In explaining         more accurately     the real nature          of the author’s
vision   of colours, he employs                        of reference the
                                       as standard examples
“ Cercles Chromatiques,” and “ Gammes Chromatiques ” of M. Che
vreul (copies of which accompany the paper), the former giving
various gradations of hue, the latter, gradations of tone.   He states
that his vision is perfectly dichromic, and shows the applicability to
it of the de<U+FB01>nition of this kind of vision given by Sir John Herschel,
which he believes has never hitherto been followed out                    so completely
as is necessary to explain the phenomena observed.
    Blue and yellow he         sees perfectly well, and has no reason to            doubt
that his sensations of these two colours are the                  same as those     of the
normal-eyed.   The third primary, red, is the one in regard to which
his vision is defective, but the study of the sensations produced by
this colour has been involved in some di<U+FB02>iculty.    Carmine, the arti
<U+FB01>cial representative of what is usually considered pure red, presents
to the author’s eye a very positive sensation, which he long supposed
to be a distinct colour;         but on examining      it more closely, he found
it to be merely       a   dark shade of yellow,      as he could        match     carmine
red perfectly with a mixture of yellow and black.                       There     is,   how
ever, avariety       of red, namely crimson, which        is      perfectly invisible, as
a   colour, to his eyes,       giving only   a   sensation    of darkness;        and the
whole  of the hues of red and orange between this and yellow present
only different shades of the latter colour; the red element appearing
to act, not     as   a    colouring agent, but simply        as   a   darkening    power.
The author has endeavoured to <U+FB01>nd the place of this, to him, neutral
or invisible hue of red on the spectrum, and believes that    exists         if   it
there at all,   it   must be situated       at one or both        of the extreme ends,
a position which would appear to distinguish                  it   as possessing        some
peculiar property, and he offers            a   conjecture that this, and not car
mine red, may perhaps be the true primary colour.

                                            175
      The hues of violet, lying between blue and crimson, appear, on               a.
   similar principle, only shades of blue, the red darkening the blue in
   the same manner as the yellow.
      In   passing   on to the green division        of the colour circle, lying
  between the blue and yellow, the author calls attention to the appa
  rent anomaly, that though colour-blind persons see blue and yellow
  perfectly well, their combination,        green, should be so great a stum
  bling-block.      This fact appears to have perplexed          everybody who
   has treated on the      subject; the author imagined he was the <U+FB01>rst to
   discover the explanation, but he found he had been anticipated                 by
   Sir John Herschel, who         says  in his letter to Dalton, “the equili
  brium of blue and yellow produces your white,” i.e. the white of the
   colour-blind is not white at all, but green.          And this is consistent
  with theory; for      if normal   white is a combination    of three elements,
  the invisibility of   one  of these elements to the colour-blind should
  naturally have the       e<U+FB02>'ect  of changing the appearance of their com
  pound.       Since, therefore, green is only a colour to the normal-eyed
  as  it is contrasted with white light, it becomes no colour at all to the
  colour-blind.      The author proves this by showing that        a certain hue
   of green exactly matches, to his        eyes, a neutral grey; that all greens
  on the yellow side of this appear only shades of yellow, all on the
  blue side, only shades      of blue.
      Thus the dichromic explanation of the author’ s vision is complete.
   He has only two sensations of colour, properly so called, namely
  blue and yellow, all other hues in nature being reduced to shades of
  these.     The colour of light, or the hue resulting from their combi
  nation, may be called green, white, or grey, at pleasure.           It  is shown
  that this explanation of colour-blind vision        will fully account for the
  whole    of the various symptoms above enumerated._            Red and green,
  for example, are both seen only as shades of yellow, and          if the   yellow
  is of the   same intensity    in each,  they will appear alike, and of course
  be confounded      with each other.
      The author then proceeds to consider how far his own               case may
  be regarded      as a type   of the defect in general.     The varied and in
, congruous      nature   of the symptoms has given rise to a belief that
  there]   are many varieties of colour-blindness,           or at least many
  di<U+FB02>'erent degrees     of severity; but after carefully examining the pub
  lished accounts, he has arrived at the conviction            that the true di
                                                                   Q  2

chromic    affection   is much      more common      than   is  generally  sup
posed.    He points out reasons why the descriptions given by the
colour-blind of their sensations may often be imperfectly expressed
and easily misunderstood,        alludes to the di<U+FB01>iculty of explaining      the
symptoms     by any other hypothesis,       or even of classifying     them in
any consistent way;      and considers the fact exempli<U+FB01>ed         in his own
case,   that dichromic vision        will explain   all  the   phenomena,      as
strongly corroborative     of the uniformity insisted on.
    From the results of his investigations, the author draws          a few   in
 ferences in regard to the theory of the primary colours, although ad
 mitting his incompetence to deal fully with this part of the subject.
 He considers that, from the extreme simplicity of the phenomena of
 colours  as  seen   by the colour-blind, their experience may serve as
 a  stepping-stone    to the more      complex problems      of normal vision.
 Their light is divisible into two colours, blue and yellow; and since
 these must be undoubtedly primaries to the colour-blind, it is rea
 sonable to infer they should also be primaries in the normal system.
The dichromic eye further becomes of use as an analyser of colours,
 and can detect the presence        of blue or yellow in compounds whose
 elements may be      inseparable to normal eyes.        Thus it <U+FB01>nds that in
orange there is much yellow, and in violet much blue, and therefore
these cannot be simple colours.          Red, producing no impression         on
the colour-blind eye, may be assumed to be a simple colour, and
may therefore      be put down as the third primary, so that the phe
nomena of colour-blindness         would appear to con<U+FB01>rm the ordinary
theory, or at least are    more consistent with it than with any other.
The fact of carmine-red         presenting   to the colour-blind a‘ decided
sensation of yellow, affords a con<U+FB01>rmation           of Sir David Brewster’s
theory of the triple spectrum, according          to which this result ought
to be expected.
    The principal symptom of colour-blindness          being the mistaking     of
red for green, and vice verszi, it has been thought that the use               of
these colours   for railway and ship signals becomes dangerous where
colour-blind persons may have to observe them.             The author points
out that this danger may        be obviated   by very simple means. Red
and green are      not confounded with each other generally, but only
such hues of them as lie in both cases on theyellow side                 of the
neutral; and therefore     if the  green be made a blue green at the same

                                     177
 time that the red is a yellow red, they become quite as distinct to
the colour-blind as to the normal-eyed.
    The colouring of geological maps is very perplexing to the colour
blind, and it is recommended that engraved marks, to distinguish
the different strata, should always be added to the colours.
    In  conclusion, the author gives hints which he considers useful for
the examination     of colour-blind persons, and states the importance of
collecting further evidence on the subject,    of an accurate and de<U+FB01>nite
nature.
II.   “ Researches on the Velocities of Currents‘ of Air in Vertical
       Tubes, due to the presence of Aqueous Vapour in the At
       mosphere.”      By W.D. CHowNE, M.D. Communicated by
       JOHN BISHOP, Esq., F.R.S. Received May 22, 1856.
                                 ( Abstract.)
    This was   a paper supplementary    to one presented June 14th, 1855,
an abstract    of which was published in the ‘ Proceedings of the Royal
Society’ for June 21st, 1855.        The author having ascertained that
an upward current       of air becomes established     in  a vertical  tube
placed in as quiescent an atmosphere as can be obtained, and having
demonstrated its existence by means        of anemometric discs placed in
tubes as described in that paper, proceeded to ascertain the velocity
of the currents by which the discs were moved.
    In order to estimate the velocity of the currents, one    of the    ane
mometric discs was placed within a short zinc tube three inches in
diameter, the lower end of which was accurately <U+FB01>tted into an aspi
rator capable    of containing thirty-six gallons of water.    By drawing
off in a given time a quantity of water equal in         bulk to the cubic
contents of one of the tubes described in the former paper, the
velocity  of  a current required to produce a given number     of rotations
of the disc was determined.
    The experiments were varied by altering the height of water in
the aspirator, and thereby changing the velocity, while the exit
                                                            '
ori<U+FB01>ce remained unaltered.
    By ascertaining the number of rotations of the anemometric disc,

                                              17_8
caused by currents          of air of different velocities thus produced,                he
was enabled to arrive at a measure of the velocities in tubes placed
in a still atmosphere,        as described          in his former paper.
   The author in that paper pointed out a correspondence between
the variations of force in the upward currents of atmospheric air in
the tubes and variations                in the humidity of the atmosphere, and
expressed his belief that the variations were attributable                          in great
measure to the varying hygrometric conditions                       of the atmosphere.
   In further proof of this               position,    he has appended        two tables,
showing     that    both natural                      of atmospheric
                                           and arti<U+FB01>cial increase
humidity are accompanied by increase in the velocity of the rotations,
and that in each case increase of humidity is attended by increase of
velocity, independent of temperature.
III.   “ On the Thermal Effects of Fluids in Motion.” By J. P.
       -IOULE, Esq., F.R.S., and Professor W. THOMSON, F.R.S.
       Received May 23, 1856.
       On the Temperature               of Solids   exposed to Currents      of Air.
   In examining         the thermal effects experienced by air rushing through
narrow passages, we have found, in various parts of the stream, very
decided indications of a lowering of temperature (see Phil. Trans.
June 1853), but never nearly                 so great as theoretical       considerations
at <U+FB01>rst led us to expect, in air forced by its own pressure into so
rapid motion       as    it was in our experiments.           The theoretical investi
gation is simply as follows             :—Let P and V denote the pressure and
the volume    of      of the air moving very slowly up a wide pipe
                   a pound
towards the narrow passage.   Let p and 1: denote the pressure and
the volume     per pound in any part of the narrow                       passage,     where
the velocity is g.         Let also       e--E   denote the difference       of intrinsic
energies   of the air per pound in the two situations.                   Then the equa
tion of mechanical effect is
                             9°’   _    (PV _pv)+(E           e),
                             29
since the <U+FB01>rst member              is   the mechanical value         of the motion, per

                                           179
pound   of air; the <U+FB01>rst bracketed term of the second member is the
excess of work done in pushing it forward, above the work spent by
it in pushing forward the <U+FB02>uid immediately in advance of it in the
narrow passage;        and the second bracketed          term is the amount          of
intrinsic energy given up by the fluid in passing from              one situation
to the other.
    Now, to the degree of accuracy to which air follows Boyle’s and
Gay-Lussac’s laws,       we have
                                  pv = %PV,
if t   and   T   denote the temperatures         of the air in the two positions
reckoned from the absolute zero            of the air-thermometer.            Also, to
about the same degree of accuracy, our experiments on the tempera~
ture    of air escaping from     a state   of high pressure through a porous
plug,            Mayer’s hypothesis as the thermo-dynamic law of
         establish
expansion; and to this degree of accuracy we may assume the in
trinsic energy of a mass of air to be independent of its density when
its temperature       remains unaltered.      Lastly, Carnot’s principle, as
modi<U+FB01>ed       in the dynamical     theory,   shows that a <U+FB02>uid which ful<U+FB01>ls
those three laws must have its capacity for heat in constant volume
constant for all temperatures        and p1jessures,—a result con<U+FB01>rmed by
Regna_ult’s direct experiments to a corresponding degree               of accuracy.
Hence the variation of intrinsic energy in a mass of air               is,   according
to those laws, simply the difference of temperatures multiplied by                   a
constant, irrespectivelyof any expansion or condensation that may
have been experienced.    Hence,   N denote the capacity for heat of
                                       if
a pound of air in constant volume, and   the mechanical value of the
                                             J
thermal unit, we have
                             E-e = JN (T-t).
Thus the preceding equation of mechanical effect             becomes
                           = PV
                      5;           (1- ,%)+JN(T-t).

pressure to the speci<U+FB01>c heat of air in constant volume; H, the pro

the homogeneous atmosphere”                 for air at the freezing-point              (26,215
feet, according       to Regnault’s     observations on the density of air), and
t0   the absolute temperature of freezing (about 274° Cent.).                              Hence

   Now the velocity of sound in air at any temperature is equal to
the product of 4/]? into the velocity a body would acquire in falling
under    the action of a constant                force   of gravity through half the
height of the homogeneous atmosphere; and therefore                             if    we denote
by 00 the velocity of sound in air at the temperature T,                        we have
                                      at’   = /cgPV.
Hence we derive from the preceding equation,

which expresses the lowering of temperature, in any part of the
narrow channel, in terms of the ratio of the actual velocity of the
air in that place to the velocity            of sound in air at the temperature
of the stream where it moves slowly up towards the rapids.                              It    is to
be observed, that the only hypothesis                    which has been made            is,   that
in all the states of temperature and pressure through which                            it   passes
the air ful<U+FB01>ls the three gaseous laws mentioned                          above;       and that
whatever frictional resistance, or irregular action from irregularities
in the channel, the air may have experienced before coming to the
part considered, provided only has not been allowed either to give
                                            it

any mechanical energy in sound, or in other motions                            not among its
own particles, the preceding formulae will give the lowering of tem
perature      it   experiences    in acquiring the velocity               g.     It   is    to be
observed that this       is   not the velocity the air would have in issuing in
the same quantity at the density which                     it      has in the slow stream
approaching        the narrow passage.             Were no <U+FB02>uid friction operative
in the circumstances, the density and pressure would                          be the same       in

                                     181
the slow stream <U+FB02>owing away from, and in the slow stream approach
ing towards     the narrow   passage;    and each would be got by con
sidering   the lowering   of temperature from       T   to t as simply due to
expansion, so that we should have
                               i_

                                        v
by Poisson’s     formula.    Hence   if  Q denote what we may call the
“reduced velocity” in any part of the narrow channel, as distin
gulished from g, the actual or true velocity in the same locality, we
have
                          Q—

 Hence,   if there were no <U+FB02>uid friction, the     “  reduced velocity” could
 never, in any part   of a narrow channel, exceed '578 of the velocity
 of sound, in air of the temperature which the air has in the wide
 parts of the channel, where it is moving slowly. If this temperature
 be 13° Cent. above the freezing-point,       or 287° absolute temperature
 (being 55° Fahr.,    an ordinary atmospheric         condition), the velocity
 of sound would be 1115 feet per second, and the maximum reduced
 velocity  of the stream would be 644 feet per second.            The cooling

                                          182
effect that air must,       in such circumstances,         experience in acquiring
such a velocity would be from 287° to 268° absolute temperature,
or   19° Cent.
    The effects of <U+FB02>uid friction in different parts of the stream would
require to be known in order to estimate the reduced velocity in any
narrow    part,   according     to either the density on the high-pressure
side or the density on the low-pressure              side.    We have not     as yet
made any sufficient        investigation     to allow us to give even a conjec
tural estimate of what these            effects  may be in any case.         But it
appears improbable         that the “reduced velocity,” according             to the
density on the high-pressure            side, could ever with friction exceed
the greatest amount          it could possibly have without friction. It
                                                “ reduced
therefore seems      improbable that the                     velocity” in terms of
the density on the high-pressure           side can ever, in the narrowest part
of the channel, exceed 644          feet per second,    if the  temperature   of the
high-pressure      air moving      slowly be about the atmospheric tempera
ture   of 13°  Cent. used in the preceding estimate.
   Experiments in which we have forced air through apertures of
T?’-g<U+FB01>,  $1,     and -I-§-3-0-the of an inch in diameter drilled in thin
plates of copper, have given us a maximum velocity reduced to the
density of the high-pressure          side equal to 550 feet per second.        But
there can be    little doubt that the stream of air, after issuing from an
ori<U+FB01>ce in a thin plate, contracts as that of water does under similar
circumstances.        If the   velocity were calculated from the area of this
contracted    part of the stream, it is highly probable that the maxi
mum velocity reduced to the density on the high-pressure                 side would
be  found   as near 644 feet as the          degree   of accuracy of the experi
ments warrants us to expect.
   As an example of the results we have obtained on examining the
temperature      of the rushing stream by            a thermo-electric     junction
placed -§th of    an inch above the ori<U+FB01>ce,           we cite an experiment, in
which the total pressure of the air in the receiver being 98 inches of
mercury, we found the velocity in the ori<U+FB01>ce equal to 535 and 1780
feet respectively     as reduced to the density on the high-pressure             and

of it,)       a   greater cooling           effect     than 20° Cent;               we therefore        infer
that      a   body round which               air     is   <U+FB02>owing rapidly acquires a higher
temperature           than the average temperature                        of   the   air close to      it   all
round.            The explanation            of this conclusion              probably       is,   that the
surface of contact between the air and the solid   the locality of the         is
most intense frictional generation of heat that takes place, and that
consequently         a   stratum of air round the body has a higher average
temperature than the air further off                          ;   but whatever the explanation
may be,        it   appears certainly            demonstrated that the air does not give
its own temperature               even      to    a   tube through which              it   <U+FB02>ows, or to       a
wire or thermometer-bulb                    completely surrounded by it.
     Having        been convinced           of this conclusion by experiments on rapid
motion        of air through small               passages,        we inferred       of course that the
same      phenomenon          must take place universally                         whenever air <U+FB02>ows
against       a    solid or   a   solid      is    carried        through air.        If   a   velocity of

difference        of temperature between the air and the solid, how probable
is  that meteors moving at from six to thirty miles per second even
     it
through   rare<U+FB01>ed atmosphere, really acquire, in accordance with
               a
the same law, all the heat which they manifest!                                   On the other hand,
it   seemed worth        whileto look for the                     same   kind of     effect on    a    much
smaller       scale in bodies moving at moderate velocities                                through the
ordinary atmosphere.   Accordingly, although    has been a practice          it
in general undoubtingly followed, to whirl   thermometer through         a
the air for the purpose             of <U+FB01>nding the atmospheric temperature, we
have tried and found, with thermometers                                  of different      sizes and va
riously shaped bulbs, whirled through the air at the end of string,                               a

 exactly the same circumstances at smaller velocities.             By alternately
 whirling the   same    thermometers      for half    a minute    or so fast, and
 then for  a similar time slow, we have found differences of tempera
 ture sometimes little     if  at all short of a Fahrenheit degree.            By
 whirling   a thermo-electric     junction alternately       fast and slow, the
 same phenomenon       is most satisfactorily      and strikingly exhibited by
 a galvanometer.     This last experiment we have performed at night,
 under a cloudy sky, with the galvanometer               within doors, and the
 testing  thermo-electric    apparatus whirled in the middle           of a <U+FB01>eld;
 and thus, with as little as can be conceived             of disturbing circum
 stances, we con<U+FB01>rmed the result we had previously found by whirling
 thermometers.
          Velocity of Air    escaping through narrow Apertm-es*.
    In the foregoing    part of this communication,         referring to the cir
cumstances    of certain experiments, we have stated our opinion that
the velocity of atmospheric      air impelled through narrow ori<U+FB01>ces was,
in the narrowest part of the stream, greater than the reduced velocity
corresponding to the atmospheric pressure; in other words, that the
density of the air, kept at a constant temperature, was, in the narrow
est part, less than the atmospheric        density.     In  order to avoid mis
conception, we now add, that this holds true only when the difference
of pressures on the two sides is small, and friction plays but a small
part in bringing down the velocity of the exit stream. If there is a
great difference between the pressures on the two sides, the reduced
velocity will, on the contrary,      be less than that corresponding         with
the atmospheric pressure; and even          if the  pressure in the most rapid
part falls short of the atmospheric pressure, the density may, on ac
count   of the cooling experienced, exceed the atmospheric density. _
    We stated that, at 57° Fahr., the greatest velocity of air passing
through    a small  ori<U+FB01>ce is 550 feet per second,            if reduced to the
density on the high-pressure       side.    The experiments from which we
obtained this result enable us also to say that this maximum occurs,
with the above temperature and        a barometric pressure      of 3014 inches,
when the pressure     of the air is equal to about 50 inches of mercury
above the atmospheric       pressure.     At   a  higher or lower pressure, a
smaller volume of the compressed air escapes in a given time.

    Surface Condenser.--A three-horse power high-pressure steam
engine was procured for our experiments.           Wishing to give it equal
power with a lower pressure, we caused the steam from the eduction
port to pass downwards through           a perpendicular  iron gas-pipe, ten
feet  long and an inch and       a half in diameter, placed within a larger
pipe through which water was made to ascend.              The lower end of
the gas-pipe was connected with the feed-pump          of the boiler, a small
ori<U+FB01>ce    being    contrived in the pump cover in order to allow the
escape    of air before it could pass, along with the condensed water,
into the boiler.       This simple arrangement constituted a “surface
condenser” of a very e<U+FB01>icient kind, giving a vacuum of 23 inches,
although considerable leakage of air took place, and the apparatus
generally was not so perfect as subsequent experience would have
enabled us to make it.       Besides the ordinary well-known advantages
of the “surface condenser,”          such as the prevention   of incrustation
of the     boiler,  there is one which may be especially        remarked    as
appertaining     to the system we have adopted, of causing the current      of
steam to move in an opposite direction to that of the water employed
to condense it.       The refrigerating water may thus      be made to pass
out   of the condenser at a high temperature, while the vacuum is that
due to a low temperature       ;  and hence the quantity of water used for
the purpose       of condensation may be materially reduced. We <U+FB01>nd
that our system does not require an amount of surface so great as to
involve    a   cumbrousness     or cost which would prevent       its general
adoption,    and have no doubt that it will shortly supersede that at
the present time almost universally       used.
IV. “On        the Stability of Loose Earth.”        By W.   J. MACQUORN
       RANKINE, Esq., G.E., F.R.SS.           L & E., Regius Professor of
       Civil Engineering and Mechanics              in the University of
       Glasgow.
                                   (Abstract)
   The object of this paper is to deduce the mathematical theory of
that kind of stability which depends on the mutual friction of the
parts of a granular mass devoid of tenacity, from the known laws of
friction, unaided by any hypothesis.

                                         186
      The fundamental principle of the internal stability of such a mass
   has already been published       in the ‘
                                             Proceedings of the Royal Society’
   for the 6th of March, 1856, viz. that the ratio of the dilference to
   the sum of the greatest and least pressures at each point         of the mass
   must not   exceed the sine    of the angle of repose.
      The principles of the general theory of the internal equilibrium of
   a solid mass are expressed in a form suited to the special subject of
  the paper.      For the purpose of determining the conditions of equi
  librium under its own weight, of a solid mass whose upper surface is
  that generated by the motion of a horizontal straight line along a
  line of any <U+FB01>gure described on a vertical plane at right angles to the
  generating    line, the mass is supposed to be divided          into layers   of _
   equal horizontal thrust by a series       of surfaces, which layers are sub
   divided into elementary horizontal prisms by vertical planes normal
  to the vertical     plane <U+FB01>rst mentioned.         For independent variables
  there are taken the horizontal coordinate in this plane, and the total
  horizontal thrust from the upper surface down to a given surface of
  equal thrust.      The condition of equilibrium of any one of the be
  fore-mentioned     elementary     prisms being expressed by a diiferential
  equation in terms of those variables, the integration         of that equation
  gives the vertical coordinate of any surface        of equal thrust in terms
  of the total thrust down to that surface and of the horizontal co
  ordinate.     The integral obtained belongs to       a class <U+FB01>rst investigated
  by Fourier.
     An approximation        to the forms     of the surfaces of equal thrust
  is obtained by a simple graphic process, <U+FB01>rst employed by Prof.
  Wilham Thomson in connexion with the theory of electricity.
     It  is shown incidentally how the same integral may be applied to
  determine the intrados       from the extrados of any arched rib, loaded
. only with its own weight.
     The pressure on      a surface  of equal thrust is vertical; the pressure
  on a vertical plane at a given point is parallel to the surface        of equal
  thrust traversing that point.         When the upper surface of the mass
  of earth is one plane, horizontal or inclined, the surfaces of equal
  thrust are planes parallel to it.        When the upper surface presents
  elevations   and depressions, the surfaces       of equal thrust have corre
  sponding    elevations    and   depressions,    gradually vanishing     as  the
  depth increases.

    The principles of the paper are applied to the determination of
the pressure    of earth against walls, and the power_of earth to sustain
buildings. The weight of the building which a horizontal bed of
earth will sustain, exceeds the weight of the earth displaced by the
foundation, in a ratio which is a function of the angle of repose.
V. “ On      the Geometrical Isomorphism      of Crystals.” By HENRY_
       JAMES Baooxs,          Esq., F.R.S., Hon. M.C.P.S. &c. Re
       ceived   June 11, 1856.
                                  (Abstract.)
    The author commences by remarking that all the crystals at pre
 sent known have been divided into the six following groups or
systems :-—the cubic, pyramidal,       rhombohedral,  prismatic, oblique,
                             T
anorthic.
    He then states that he has constructed tables which accompany
this paper of the minerals comprised in each of these systems, except
the cubic, in a manner new, as he believes, to crystallography; and
that the unexpected facts exhibited by the tables present that science
under a new aspect.
    The author explains brie<U+FB02>y the language and notation he employs
in discussing the results of the new tables.
    It appears that the crystals in each system, except the cubic, are
 distinguished    from each other by what are termed their elementary
angles, that is by angles between particular faces of what       may be
termed elementary forms.
    It  is next observed that there is not in crystals any natural cha
racter     which indicates an elementary or primary form, and it is
shown that cleavage which Hauy regarded as such an indication,          is
only   a   physical character depending upon the degree of force with
which the crystalline particles cohere at the surfaces of particular
         '
faces.
  1
                                                         ,
    The question of high indices is also considered with reference to
their in<U+FB02>uence on the choice of an elementary or primary form, and
a general explanation is given of the nature of such indices.
    The author then     states that the most important of the facts pre
seuted by these tables, are the horizontal       ranges of nearly   equal

                                        188
   angles, as shown in each system, and the general disagreement                 in
   the symbols     hitherto assigned to the     faces which make with some
   other face those nearly agreeing angles.
      With regard to these facts he observes that no difference of opinion
   can arise, unless the sources from which they have been derived are
   incorrect;    but that differences of opinion     may be entertained       rela
   tive to the interpretation   of them.
      The interpretation    to which the author inclines is, that the near
   agreement in angle between two corresponding            faces    is not simply
   accidental,   but that it is the effect of some natural            relation not
   hitherto noticed, among all the crystals in each respective system;
   and hence, that where the angles between particular faces nearly
   agree,   there ought to be a corresponding      agreement in the forms        of
'
   their symbols.
      With this view of the subject in his mind, it occurred -to the
   author that there might be a similar agreement among the whole of
   the elementary angles in each system, and an examination of the
   crystals   in the pyramidal and rhombohedral          systems to ascertain
   how far this conjecture      might  be well-founded,     has shown that a
   geometrical isomorphism      does exist throughout each of these systems,
   and that similar relations may therefore be imagined           to exist in the
  other systems.
      The author has also suggested that the oblique                and anorthic
   systems are only hemihedral      and tetartohedral    varieties of prismatic
   crystals.

          Communicated       by A. W. HOFMANN, Ph.D., F.R.S.                  Re
          ceived  June 10, 1856.
      Among the hydrocarbons         which are capable of replacing         hydro
  gen, the radicals    of the general formula C,,     H(,,+1),   i.  e. the homo
  logues   of ethyl, are best examined.       There is another class of hydro
  carbons which may be represented by the general formula C,, H(,,_.1;.
  The only well-known term of this       series is the radical  allyl,   C6 H5, to
  which the attention of chemists has been especially called of late by

                                            189
the researches of Messrs. Hofmann and Cahours on allylic alcohol.
These researches have established the-most perfect parallelism                  be
tween the two classes          of radicals and their derivatives.       Both the
radicals C,,  H<,,+1;  and   (1,, H(,,._,; are monatomic, i.e. molecules capable
of replacing    1  equiv.   of hydrogen.
   These two      classes   stand in the closest relation to each other, and
it is by no means improbable that one class may pass over into the
other, for instance, that the radical propyl C6 H7, or a propyl-com
pound, may be converted into allyl or an allyl-compound.
    There exist    a  third   series   of hydrocarbons,   which, again, both by
composition     and origin, are closely allied to the former two.            They
are represented by the general           formula C, H,,;  and methylene, C2 H,,
ethylene, C4 H4, and propylene, C6116, are well-known terms belonging
to   this series.     These hydrocarbons         are also  radicals; they differ,
however, in their nature essentially from those of the former groups,
inasmuch as they are biatomic molecules, i. e. molecules capable of
replacing 2 equivs. of hydrogen.
    There exist parallel with         these three series  of radicals which form
alcohols, three other groups of radicals, which in acids play exactly
the same part that in the alcohols is assigned to the hydrocarbons.
These acid-forming        radicals contain, in addition       to carbon and hy
drogen, oxygen and other elements belonging                to the oxygen group.
They are closely connected with the radicals of the alcohols, and
this close connexion is particularly well established between the <U+FB01>rst
series  of alcohol-forming radicals and the corresponding series of acid
forming radicals.

    Formic, acetic and propionic acids are formed by the imperfect
oxidation of methyl-, ethyl- and propyl-alcohol, and we may con
sider them to be simple substitution-products             of these alcohols.
    By means of the electric current            we  are able to produce      ethyl,
methyl and hydrogen            from propionic,     acetic and formic acids, and
these acids we may reproduce               again by the action     of hydrate    of -
potassa    on   the    cyanogen        compounds    of hydrogen,     methyl    and
ethyl.

    Both   series  of radicals   are chained together by these reactions, and
we may view acetyl and          propionyl      as  formyl, the hydrogen of which
is replaced by methyl and ethyl.

    There is no doubt that the           same relation exists between the          hydro
carbons    of the other series of radicals and the radicals of the corre
sponding acids, between allyl, C6 H5, and the radical of acrylic acid,
acryl   C6  H 5 0,, and between methylene, C,            H._,,  ethylene,   C,1  H4, pro
pylene, &c., and the radicals of the bibasic acids, which are homo-
logues of succinic acid, C8 H6 Os.
    The biatomic      radicals    are    in general far less studied            than the
monatomic       radicals; still they occur in many compounds, and are
met with in different departments of chemistry.
    In   addition   to the terms already mentioned, we <U+FB01>nd them in the
phenyl, benzyl, naphthyl and other series.
    In  the hope of adding some facts to the history                 of the polyatomic
radicals,   I  have made some experiments               with chloride of ethylene,
C4   H,  C1,.
   This compound,        as well as the bromide         of ethylene, refused to       act
in many instances      ;  in others it underwent the           same change       which is
induced     by the action on it      of    a solution  of potassa in alcohol, split

lution of sulphocyanide          of potassium,       a very de<U+FB01>nite reaction takes
place.     The change being completed, the alcohol                     is separated by
distillation, and the residue treated with               a small      quantity    of cold
water in order to remove chloride or bromide                 of potassium, which is
produced, and the excess         of sulphocyanide        of potassium.         The more
or less coloured residue is then dissolved in boiling alcohol, and the
solution, after digestion       for    some    time with animal         charcoal    and a
few drops     of hydrochloric acid, <U+FB01>ltered whilst hot.                   This solution
deposits on cooling <U+FB01>ne white, very brilliant and large rhombic plates
of a hard and brittle substance*.
   * Whilst M. Buff was      engaged    with these researches,      M. Sonnenschein   has
communicated some experiments made in the same direction, which have likewise

                                       191
    The analysis of this substance leads to the formula
                                 C; H»: Cy-2 S4:
 and its formation    may be represented by the equation

   *Sulphocyanide of ethylene fuses at 90° C. and solidi<U+FB01>es at 83°.
 It is but slightly soluble in cold water, more so in boiling water,
 from which it crystallizes in groups of needles.          It is decomposed at
 a  higher temperature,      and evolves a highly pungent           vapour,   the
odour     of which very much resembles that of burnt onions. On
 boiling a solution of sulphocyanide of ethylene in water, a very acrid
 odour is observed, which produces lacrymation           and violent sneezing.
 Sulphocyanide     of ethylene has    a sharp taste, causing a     burning   sen
 sation in the throat.
    Solution of ammonia decomposes sulphocyanide of ethylene                even
 at the common temperature.          A  <U+FB02>occulent   substance separates,     and
 the solution    contains several compounds which           I have been unable
 to separate.
    At the temperature of boiling water sulphocyanide                of ethylene
 mixes with aniline in every proportion       ;  no reaction, however, is per
 ceptible.    But on boiling the mixture decomposition            sets in, and a
 volatile  substance is evolved which restores the colour of reddened
litmus paper.
    VVhen boiled with solution of hydrate of baryta and oxide of lead
or mercury, sulphocyanide of ethylene loses its sulphur; the substance
left behind possesses very little power of crystalliziug. In the case
of oxide of mercury, besides sulphide of mercury and carbonate of
barium, a dit<U+FB01>cultly soluble body containing mercury is formed.
    At   the temperature     of boiling water, sulphocyanide         of ethylene
dissolves readily in very dilute nitric acid; on cooling         of the solution
the substance is deposited unchanged.            On treating it with stronger
nitric acid    a decomposition     takes place, and     -a  crystalline  acid is
formed.      This acid is best produced         by heating sulphocyanide       of
ethylene on the water-bath         with dilute nitric'acid      as long   as red
led to the discovery of this substance.   Sonnenschein's results, which are pub
lished in the Journ. fiir Prakt. Chem. June 1855, came to our knowledge only
after a summary of the results had been sent to the editor of the Annalen der
Chem. und Pharm.--A. W. H.
                                                                 R 2

-fumes of nitrous acid are evolved.               The residue is     a  strongly acid
  syrup, which becomes <U+FB01>nally crystalline.               It is repeatedly dissolved
  in water and evaporated on the water-bath                 in order to expel the
  nitric acid.     Thus puri<U+FB01>ed, the new acid        is dissolved  in boiling water,
  neutralized    with pure carbonate of barium and separated from sul
  phate    of barium.     On cooling, the barium-salt         of the new acid cry
  stallizes.    It  is soluble .in boiling water, less so in cold water, and
  almost insoluble in alcohol, by means          of which it may be precipitated
  from its solution in water.
     On examining        the appearance and deportment            of this salt, Dr.
  Hofma11n,in       whose laboratory      I   performed     these experiments,     at
  once recognized the identity of this compound with the barium-salt
  of disulphetholic acid which he and Mr. Buckton                        have  lately
  discovered.
     This view was fully con<U+FB01>rmed by the analysis which                I  made.
     The composition       of the barium-salt,      dried at 160°, is represented
 by the formula
                                 C4 (H4 Ba-2) S4 012'
 The potassium salt of this acid is readily soluble in water; it crystal
 lizes easily, and is likewise precipitated by alcohol from its solution
 in water.      Dried   at 100°   C., it contains
                                 C,  (H, K,) S, On.
 At    160°  it sulfers no decomposition; when exposed to             a  higher tem
 perature, however, it blackens          and intumesces, empyreumatic           sub
 stances being evolved.
     It  is obvious that this. bibasie acid stands in the same relation to
 ethylene as the monobasic ethylsulphurous acid to ethyl.
     Theorigin of the two acids is perfectly analogous, the latter acid,
 according to Mr. Muspratt, being obtainable also by the action of
 nitric acid upon sulphocyanide of ethyl.
     Sulphocyanide       of ethyl, C4 H 5 Cy S2, produces ethylsulphurous
 acid, C4 H_.,, H, S, 06.                                                 .
     Sulphocyanide      of ethylene, C 4 H 4 Cy2 S4, produces ethylensulphu

     This reaction appears to throw some light upon the constitution
 of polybasic compounds.          The compounds of monatomic molecules
 of the hydrogen-group with elements or compound radicals of the
 oxygen-group,       are all remarkable     for the simplicity of their construc

tion.      The union of biatomic         radicals of the hydrogen-group with
molecules      of the oxygen-group           gives rise to combinations                 of a far
more complicated       character.       Whilst     one molecule            of water, H2        O2,
most conveniently may be considered as the type  of many compounds
of the former class, the corresponding compounds of biatomic radicals
frequently correspond to       a double molecule                of water, 2H,'O2.
  Sulphocyanide of potassium may be viewed as water, in which the
oxygen is replaced by sulphur, one of the hydrogen molecules by
cyanogen, the other by potassium.

    In   the production of sulphocyanide              of ethylene two equivalents of
chlorine in chloride of ethylene (C4 H 4 C1,) have to be eliminated by
two equivalents of potassium.     Thus the very reaction of the two
                of ethylene (C4 I-I4 C12), and two equivalents of sul
factors, chloride
phocyanide of potassium 2(K Cy S2), joins 4 equivs. of sulphur and
2   equivs. of cyanogen with one molecule of ethylene.                         This reaction
may be expressed by the following equation, which will illustrate                               at
once     my view in regard of the constitution              of this substance ;—

The acid produced       by the action of nitric acid upon sulphocyanide
of ethylene obviously belongs to the same type. In this compound,
which in the conception of this view may be called ethg/lene-sulphurous
acid, the cyanogen is replaced by hydrogen,                      whilst the sulphur has
been oxidized into the compound              radical       S2   06, which in sulphurous
acid we assume united with hydrogen.

 VII.    “Description of an Instrument for registering Changes
        of Temperature.”          By BALFOUR. STEWART, Esq. Com
       municated by J. P. GASSIOT, Esq., F.R.S., Chairman of the
        Kew Observatory Committee of the British Association.
        Received June 12, 1856.
   It lately occurred to the author that advantage might             be taken     of
the capillary action   of mercury to construct an instrument similar to
a thermometer,    but in which the mercury should expand from heat
only in one   tube, and contract from cold only in another.               Accord
ingly  a bulb was blown between two thermometric tubes of differently
sized bores, in such a manner that the tubes lay in one straight line,
with the bulb between them.            The bulb    was    then <U+FB01>lled with mer
cury, and the tubes were hermetically          sealed    at both ends, having
been  <U+FB01>rst carefully deprived of air. When the instrument thus con
structed waslaid in a horizontal position, or nearly so, its action was
precisely what the author had hoped; the mercury contracting                  from
cold only in the narrow bore, and expanding            from heat only in the
wide one,—even when viewed by a microscope                of considerable mag
nifying power.
   It was suggested by     Mr. Welsh, Director of the Kew Observatory,
that such an instrument might        be used   for measuring <U+FB02>uctuations of
atmospheric temperature       ;  and the following use afterwards occurred
to the author.      Were it required to exactly estimate the radiating

                                                 196
effect of a source of heat, it might perhaps be done by placing                                  this
instrument near the source, alternately exposing it to the in<U+FB02>uence                                of
the calori<U+FB01>c rays proceeding from the source, and intercepting                                  these
by means of         a screen.        Owing to the peculiar action of the mercury
alluded to, the effect           of the rays would be multiplied by the number
of times the screen was interposed, provided it were always retained
long enough to permit the mercury to cool down.                                The comparison
of an instrument           thus acted upon with another                   similar instrument
near    it,   screened entirely from the source              of heat, might furnish                us
with    a   means of exactly estimating the heating effect of the source.
     The author desires to express his obligation                        to   Mr. Welsh, who,
besides       <U+FB01>nding   a   use   for the instrument,         of
                                                             suggested the selection
tubes which appears to answer best, and whose experience was of
great assistance in arranging                  details.    He    is     also indebted to the
Kew Committee              of the British Association,             who kindly examined
the instrument,                                  of several by way of
                        and authorized the construction
trial. Mr. Casella undertook the operative part in their construction,
and his glass-blower, Mr. J. E. Gri<U+FB02>in, took pains to discover some
of the circumstances that interfere with the proper action of the in
strument, and constructed those that have proved successful.
     Without attempting to explain all the peculiarities of this action,
it   would seem that the mercury   kept in the narrow bore, and pre
                                                 is
vented from retreating into the bulb, by friction                   ;    but, when        a   moving
force   is    supplied by means of           a   change   of temperature, the motion of
the mercury takes place in that direction in which                        it   is   least opposed,
or most aided, by its capillary action.
     As the result obtained            is   due to the difference between two forces,
neither of which           is   very great, the construction              of such an instru
ment        requires    care; and the author will now                   state what appear          to
be the      chief points which demand attention,                 as derived from              his own
experience, and that             of those who have interested themselves in the
construction         of the tubes;          although      this experience           is   necessarily
very limited.
     1st. The tubes should be quite clean and free from moisture.
     2nd. They         should     be    in one straight         line,    and should           expand
symmetrically          into the bulb.
     3rd.     It   seems   the best arrangement,            to have the narrow tube                of
<U+FB01>at bore, not too <U+FB02>at            ;   its greatest width being about equal to the

                                       197
diameter   of the wide bore, which should be cylindrical, and neither
conical nor <U+FB02>at.
   4th. The tubes should       be well deprived    of air before being     sealed.
The instrument may       be thus graduated.
   If, when held vertically,     the smaller tube being below, the mer
cury at the ordinary temperature should <U+FB01>ll the lower tube, the bulb
and part of the upper tube, the instrument            may be pointed off in
the same manner as an ordinary thermometer.                But,  if the mercury
under these circumstances       be not enough to       <U+FB01>ll the bulb, the best
plan is perhaps     to lay the instrument        horizontally in a vessel of
water, side by side with a standard         thermometer,      and, keeping the
extremity   of the mercury in the        one  tube at a constant        point,   to
mark off its extremity      in the other tube at two or more di<U+FB02>'erent
temperatures, as shown by the standard           thermometer.        The length
of this tube corresponding        to a degree   may be      then found in the
usual way.
    The   same   process may be followed        with the other tube.           Or,
take two points in the <U+FB01>rst      tube-——say  A  and B, the distance between
them being, say 50°.       Set the mercury at the point A, and mark off
its other extremity in the second tube.           Set it now at the point B,
 and mark its extremity in the second tube.             The distance between
these two points in the second tube will be the length corresponding
 to 50°.                                                                 ,
    Graduate the tubes to within a short distance          of the bulb, and the
 best plan is perhaps to number the degrees            from    one extremity      of
 the instrument,    beginning 0...10...20, &c., on to the mark on that
 side nearest the bulb.       Suppose this mark is numbered           100°; then
 number    the mark nearest the bulb on the other side also 100°, and
 go on upwards numbering         110°, 120°, 130°, &c., until reaching the
 other extremity    of the instrument.       In  the next place ascertain the
 temperature of the mercury when it <U+FB01>lls the bulb and reaches only
 to the nearest mark on both sides.
     Let this  be C°.   In taking     an observation, note the numbers at
 both extremities of the mercury, and deduct the          less from the greater.
 To the positive remainder add the constant C with its proper sign,
 and the sum will give the true temperature.

  V_III. “ Researches on Organo-metallic Bodies.” Third Memoir.
          —On a New Series of Organic Acids containing Nitrogen.
          By Enwann FRANKLAND, Ph.D., F.R.S. Received June
          1 9, 1856.
                                     (Abstract.)
      The author,     in pursuing the line of research indicated            in his
  former     memoirs, has investigated the action        of zincethyl and zinc
  methyl upon binoxide of nitrogen, and has succeeded in producing a
  new series of organic acids, by the substitution of oxygen in binoxide
  of nitrogen by methyl, ethyl, &c.            Binoxide of nitrogen is slowly
  absorbed by zincethyl, and the sole product of the reaction is a body
  which is deposited in magni<U+FB01>cent rhomboidal colourless crystals.
  This body has the composition expressed by the formula
                             N2 C4 H5 O4 Zn+C4 H5 Zn,
  and consists of the zinc salt        of  a new acid,    for which the author
  proposes the name dinitroethylic acid,           united with zincethyl.     The
  dinitroethylate    of zinc and zincethyl       is produced   from binoxide of
  nitrogen and zincethyl according to the following equation,
                  2(Zn   C4

      The crystals      of dinitroethylate    of zinc and zincethyl      instantly
  become opake on exposure to the air, owing to the formation                of an
  oxidized     product.     They are tolerably soluble in anhydrous ether
  without decomposition, but are instantly decomposed by anhydrous
  alcohol and by water.         Exposed to the gradually increasing heat of
  an oil-bath, dinitroethylate     of zinc and zincethyl fuses at 100° Cent.,
  froths up, and begins slowly          to evolve gas.      At  180° the colour
  darkens, a small quantity       of a highly alkaline liquid distils over, and
O
  a large amount of gas is evolved.            The latter consists of carbonic
  acid, ole<U+FB01>ant gas, hydride of ethyl, nitrogen and protoxide of ni
  trogen.      When brought into contact with water, dinitroethylate of
  zinc and zincethyl       is immediately   decomposed with lively efferves
  cence,    due to the evolution   of pure hydride of ethyl.       An opalescent
  S0lU.Il0n   is formed, possessing     a  powerfully alkaline    reaction and a

    it   burns rapidly with         a   bluish green <U+FB02>ame.
         Dinitroethylic       acid can only exist in dilute solution;                                 it    can be
    prepared, either by decomposing the zinc salt with dilute sulphuric
    acid and distilling in vacuo, or by decomposing                                     the baryta salt by
    an exact equivalent         of dilute sulphuric acid.                         The dilute acid thus
    prepared      possesses    a     pungent    odour, somewhat                         resembling          that of
    the nitro-fatty acids, and an acid taste.                           It    reddens litmus paper
    strongly, and gradually              decomposes even at ordinary temperatures.
    N eutralized by       the carbonates       of the various                bases,          it   yields the cor
    responding       salts.     The silver and magnesian salts thus prepared
    were analysed.
       The salts of dinitroethylic acid are all soluble in water and in
    alcohol, and most of them crystallize with more or less di<U+FB02>iculty.
    They are all violently acted upon by concentrated nitric acid, the

    Without attaching much value to either hypothesis, the author
prefers the latter, and remarks     in conclusion that there can       be little
doubt that many new series of organic acids may, by analogous pro
cesses, be produced     from inorganic acids by the replacement of one
or more atoms of oxygen by an alcohol radical; in fact his pupil,
Mr. Hobson, is now engaged in the study of a new series containing
sulphur, produced      by the action    of zincethyl and its homologues
upon sulphurous acid.       These acids are formed by the replacement
of one equivalent of oxygen, in three equivalents of sulphurous           acid,
by an alcohol radical.
IX. “On       the Action of Urari and of Strychnia on the Animal
                   )
       Economy.’       By Professor ALBERT KGLLIKER of WVii1'z
       burg.     Communicated by Dr. SHARPEY, Sec. R.S.                     Re
       ceived   May 31, 1856.
    The communication      which  I now offer to the Royal Society con
tains a brief statement of the results    of a series of experiments which
I  lately made on the action    of the urari poison and of strychnia on
the animal economy.
                                I. URARI;
    The urari is the well-known poison from ,Guiana, also called
Curare and Woorara. That which            I employed in my experiments
Iowe to the liberality of my friend Professor           Christison of Edin
burgh.     The following are the conclusions at which       I arrived  respect
ing its operation   :—
    1.  The urari causes death very rapidly when injected into the,
blood or inserted into a wound; when introduced by way of the
mucous     membrane    of the intestinal canal its effects are slow and
require a large    dose for their production,      especially in mammalia.
When applied to the skin of frogs it is altogether inoperative.
    2. Frogs poisoned with very small doses of urari may gradually
 recover, even after it has produced complete paralysis of the nerves.
 Mammalia may also be restored,         even   after large doses,     provided
 respiration is maintained   arti<U+FB01>cially.
    3.  The urari, acting through the blood, destroys the excitability

                                           202
 of    the motor       nerves.    In frogs under its operation the terminal
 branches      of these nerves within the muscles lose their excitability
 in a few minutes, whilst their trunks become affected an hour or two
 later.     If, after the nervous extremities have become paralysed, the
 heart of the animal be excised so as to prevent the nei~ves from
 receiving      any further share of the poison, the nervous trunks may
 retain their excitability for three or four hours.
    4. The brain is less affected by the urari than the nerves in the
 muscles;       still when, by ligature      of the two aortic arches, in frogs,
 the poisoning is con<U+FB01>ned to the anterior half of the body, the volun
 tary movements of the limbs speedily cease, whilst automatic move
 ments, of doubtful nature and probably proceeding from the medulla
 oblongata, may be still observed for half an hour or an hour after
 the poison has begun to operate.
     5.  The spinalicord is considerably less affected than the brain by
 this poison, and by local limitation of the poisoning (as in No. 4),
 it is found that the cord retains its re<U+FB02>ex activity from half an hour
 to an hour and a half, and the excitability of its white substance or
 its conducting        power from two to three hours after the poison has
taken effect.         It  is worthy  of remark that in such     cases the impaired
re<U+FB02>ex activity       of the spinal cord may      be revived  by strychnia directly
 applied to it.
     6. The sensory nerves, as shown also by locally limited poisoning,
retain their functional         activity  as  long at any rate    as re<U+FB02>ex   actions
 can be excited,         and when the depressed re<U+FB02>ex           activity has    been
revived by means           of strychnia, these nerves are found not to have
been     in the slightest        degree injured,     so  that it   seems   doubtful
whether the urari in any way affects them.
     7. The nerves      of the involuntary     muscles and  of the glands   are also
paralysed by the action          of urari, at least  I <U+FB01>nd this   to be true in the
following      cases, viz.
    a. The pneumoyastric,           as regards its in<U+FB02>uence    on the heart.
    b.   The sympathetic        (its cervical portion), in its relation       to the
iris.
    c.   The nerves      of the posterior   lymph-hearts    of the frog.
    d. The nerves        of the  vessels in the web of the frog’s foot.
    e.   The splanchnic       nerves of the rabbit, as affecting the peristaltic
motions    .

                                      203
   f.   The nerves governing the secretion       of   the eubrnaxillary   gland
in dogs.                                           _
    8. The voluntary’    muscles remain perfectly excitable, but show a
greater    tendency    than   usual   to   merely    local contractions.       In
general   the cadaveric    rigidity of these muscles appears to           set  in
later than usual.
    9. The   plain or non-striated muscles also remain long irritable
after poisoning by urari.
    10. The heart, in amphibia,      is little affected by urari.      Its pul
sation as well as the circulation of the blood goes on regularly for
many     hours  after   the poisoning     is established.    The only thing
worthy of note is that the beat of the heart appears to be somewhat
quickened, probably from paralysis of the pneumogastric nerves. In
frogs poisoned with urari, the heart, when out in two, shows the
usual phenomenon,       namely, that the half which contains the ganglia
continues to pulsate whilst the other does          not; from which it may
be  inferred that these ganglia are not paralysed.           As to the nerves
in the substance of the heart, those at least which are derived from
the pneumogastric      are unquestionably     paralysed (vide No. 7)‘.
    11. The lymph-hearts       of frogs poisoned with urari soon cease to
move.
    12.  The blood of animals poisoned by urari is <U+FB02>uid and dark, but
coagulates when drawn from the vessels, and forms a weak clot which
is but little reddened      by exposure to air.         Directly mixed with
blood, urari does   not prevent coagulation, but the blood in this case
 also remains dark and scarcely reddens on exposure.
    13. The blood    of animals poisoned by urari has the        same poison
ous qualities   as that substance     itself, but not in a degree sufficient
 to produce the   full effects of the poison.    Urari when directly mixed
 with blood loses none of its efficacy.
    14. Urari, in concentrated solution, applied locally to nerves            ex
tinguishes their excitability, but only after a considerable         time, and
 it appears to act similarly on the nerves in the substance of the
 muscles.    Dilute solutions     have no injurious operation.         Applied
 directly to the brain and spinal cord, urari is altogether harmless
 provided its absorption be prevented.
    15.  When arti<U+FB01>cial respiration is kept up in quadrupeds poisoned
 with urari, I <U+FB01>nd that, as observed by Bernard, many of the secre

                                          204
  tions become increased-—as the tears, saliva, urine and mucus of the
'
  air-passages, which eifect appears to be owing to the paralysis of the
  vascular    nerves and consequent dilatation         of the vessels caused by
  the poison.
      16.  In   mammalia      urari  causes   death by paralysis    of the respi
  ratory nerves and suppression           of the respiration, which brings on
  convulsions in these animals as a collateral effect.              In frogs the
  <U+FB01>nal extinction of the functions may also be partly ascribed to sup
  pressed action of the lungs and defective oxidation of the blood,
  which at length renders the heart un<U+FB01>t to perform its o<U+FB01>ice ; but it
  must be observed that in this case the cause of death is not so plain,
  inasmuch      as in these animals the functions         are  in a great degree
  independent      of the pulmonary respiration.
                                 II.  STRYCHNIA.
      Some experiments with strychnia (the acetate) gave the following
  results   :—
      1.  Strychnia has not the least in<U+FB02>uence on the peripheral nerves
  through the blood, which is best shown by cutting the nerves before
  administering     the poison.
      2. Strychnia paralyses the motor nerves of the voluntary muscles
  by exciting them to too energetic action,           a paralysis  which may    be
  compared      to that caused by powerful electric currents         acting upon
  the nerves.      In  frogs, when the tetanic spasms are over, the nerves
  often show no trace of excitability; in mammalia they generally retain
  it in   a  slight   degree,   but never show the     same energy    of action as
  when uninjured.
      3. Strychnia does not affect the sensory nerves.
      4. The heart is not affected by strychnia,            not even during the
  tetanic spasms, with the exception only that its pulsations are some
  times a little slower during the tetanic state.           On the contrary, the
  lymph-hearts of frogs contract            themselves as soon as the tetanus
  begins, and remain in this state        as  long as the spasms last.
     5. The tetanic <U+FB01>ts can be brought on in two ways; <U+FB01>rst, through
  the sensory nerves,      which, by irritating the grey substance of the
  spinal cord, produce        the tetanic contractions    as re<U+FB02>ex movements;
  and, secondly,      through    the brain, which is not affected at all by
  strychnia and preserves its powers of volition and sensation.           Accord

                                     205
ingly, animals poisoned with strychnia try to move in the ordinary
way, but every attempt brings on a tetanic <U+FB01>t, so that it is plain that
the spinal    cord may also     be excited    by the brain to its peculiar
actions.
   6.  If  the tetanus    produced    by strychnia   has been strong,      the
muscles are less irritable and pass much sooner into the state of
cadaver-ic  rigidity, which is very strongly marked, and seems to last
longer than it generally does.      The same early onset of rigidity may
be observed in animals killed by tetanus excited by electricity.

                                ( Abstract.)
   In  the pursuance of his plan    of minutely examining certain typical
forms of Foraminifera, for the purpose of elucidating their history as
living beings, and of determining the value of the characters they
present to the systematist,      the author in this memoir         details the
results   of his investigations   on the genera Orbiculina,         Alveolina,
Cycloclypeus,    and Heterostegina.
   The genus Orbiculina has long been known, through its preva
lence in the West Indian seas, which causes its shells to abound in
the shore-sands    of many of the islands of that region.       These shells
present great varieties of form, and have been ranked under three
distinct species;     but M. d’Orbigny has correctly       inferred,   from a
comparison    of  a large number    of specimens, that their diversities of
form, are partly attributable     to differences in the stage of growth,
and partly to individual variation,        so  that all the Orbiculinm of
Cuba, the Antilles, &c., are referable to but one speci<U+FB01>c type.             Of
the essential features of its structure, however, he would seem to be
quite ignorant; since he ranges Orbiculina in a distinct order from
Orbitolitee, to which it is very closely allied.         This alliance was
<U+FB01>rst pointed out by Prof. Williamson, whose account of the structure
of Orbiculina, though defective and erroneous in certain points, is
nevertheless correct in the main.
   The author has had the opportunity of examining             not merely a

   considerable     number   of West Indian specimens, but also a set of
   specimens peculiarly remarkable for their high development, which
   form part     of Mr. Cuming’s Philippine collection.           Many of    these
   present the form of <U+FB02>attened        disks, marked with concentric circles,
   and having      one or more rows of pores at their edges, not distin
   guishable, save by their prominent        central nuclei, from certain forms
   of Orbitolites formerly described.          The similarity is equally great
   in their internal structure; so that, if a marginal fragment only
   were submitted      to examination,   it would not    be possible to say with
   certainty   whether    it belonged to an Orbitolites or an Orbiculina.
   The distinguishing character of the latter is derived from its early
   mode of growth, which is uniformly spiral; and from the circum
   stance that each of the <U+FB01>rst three or four turns             of the spire not
   merely surrounds,      but invests its predecessor, thereby producing an
   excess   in the thickness of the earlier over that of the later-formed
   portion, which gives rise to the central protuberance            already men
   tioned.     The transition from the spiral to the cyclical mode of in
   crease   is elfected (just as it is in those individuals of Orbitolites
   which begin life upon the spiral type) by the opening-out of the
   mouth of the spire, which extends itself on either side around the
   previously-formed      body, until its two divisions meet on the opposite
   side, where they coalesce       so as to constitute     a complete     annulus.
   This transition may take place at any period of growth after the
 . completion of the <U+FB01>rst four or <U+FB01>ve turns of the spire; so that we
   sometimes meet with small specimens which have already become
   discoidal   and taken-on    the cyclical   plan of growth, whilst we occa
   sionally meet with full-grown specimens which retain                 the spiral
   form, and show no tendency whatever towards the assumption               of the
   cyclical   plan   of growth. These facts obviously point to the very
   subordinate value of plan of growth as a distinctive character. ~
      The author next proceeds to           a  like investigation   of the genus
   Alveolimz,    which he shows to bear         a very marked     resemblance    to
   Orbitolites and Orbiculina, in the simple concretionary texture of the
   shell, in the freedom of communication everywhere existing among
   the chambers, in the mutual relations of these to each other, and
   intheir    mode of communication         with the exterior; whilst its plan
   of growth is very different, the axis round which the spiral turns
   being greatly elongated, and every additional whorl of the spire pro

                                        207
   ducing a much greater augmentation of its length than of its diameter.
   There is obviously      a close physiological relationship between this
   genus and the preceding, since the condition        of each individual seg
   ment   of the sarcode-body must     be essentially the same    in each; and
  it is merely in the mode in which these segments are multiplied,—a
  character which we have seen not to be constant in dilferent parts
  even   of the   same   specimens of Orbitolites and Orbiculina,—that           it
  differs from them.
      A  marked contrast     to Orbitolites and Orbiculina in all their phy
  siological characters, coexisting with an agreement in their respective
  plans   of growth, is presented by the genera Cyclaclg/peas and Hete
  rostegina; the former of which, like Orbitolites, is cyclical from the
  beginning,    its chambers being formed in successive annuli round a
  central   cell; whilst the latter, like Orbiculina, is spiral in the <U+FB01>rst
  instance, but tends, as age advances, to assume the discoidal shape
  and cyclical plan of growth. The genus Cycloclypeus is a new one,
  founded by the author upon specimens dredged-up by Sir E. Belcher
  oil" the coast of Borneo.      These are the largest Foraminifera at pre
  sent known to exist;       the diameter   of some of them being not less
 than    2%  inches.    The genus Heterostegina was formed by M. d’Or
 bigny; but he        seems  only to have  been acquainted    with young     spe
 cimens, and has altogether        misapprehended     its true characters and
 relations.      A  fragment  of the <U+FB02>attened spire of Heterostegina could
 scarcely be distinguished from a marginal portion of the disk of Cy
 cloclypeus;      so close is the  conformity between the two,       as regards
 the form and relations of the chambers, their mode            of communica
 tion, and the structure of their shelly envelope. Each chamber, as
 in Nummulites, has its own proper wall, so that the partition be
 tween the adjacent chambers, whether of the same row or            of different
 rows, is double; and between its two lamellae there is interposed an
 additional stratum of shell that belongs to neither.          This additional
 stratum is thin, in the septa dividing adjacent chambers of the same
 row; but it is much thicker, and forms             a much     more complete
 separation,    in the septa intervening     between different rows.        It is
traversed     by a canal-system, analogous to that existing in Nummu
lites; which the author believes to be occupied in the living state by
threads of sarcode, and to        be specially destined   for the nutrition of
the ‘intermediate skeleton’ formed by the aggregate of these inter
                                                                s 2

                                     208
posed lamellae.      The chamber      is covered-in   above and below by
successive layers   of a minutely-tubular and peculiarly-compact      shell
substance, resembling dentine in its general aspect;        certain parts of
this, however, are non-tubular,'and form cones,         of which the bases
appear on the surface as minute rounded tubercles.             The adjacent
chambers of the same row do not seem to communicate with each
other; but each chamber communicates with two chambers of the
previously-formed row, and, in like manner, with two of the subse
quently-formed row, by narrow        passages,  the number and position   of
which are by no means constant.          These passages seem to afford the
principal means whereby the segments of the sarcode-body occupy
ing the inner chambers, can be nourished from the exterior; but it
is by no means impossible that the tubuli         of the shelly laminae that
invest the chambers above and below, may also be subservient to this
 purpose,   since, however numerous        may be the laminae, the tubuli
 are continued    through them all from the cavity of the chamber to
 the external surface.
    The almost entire separation of the segments of the sarcode-body
 in these two genera, the investment of each of them with its own
proper envelope of shell, the minutely-tubular structure and <U+FB01>rm
 consistence of the shell-substance, and the interposition of the inter
 mediate skeleton with its canal-system, are features that place them
 in such marked contrast with Orbitolites and Orbiculina, that, not
 withstanding their conformity to those two genera in their respective
 plans of growth, it is scarcely possible for them to be more widely
 removed in everything       that relates to their respective physiological
 conditions.
    From   a comparison     of the <U+FB01>ve genera whose structure has been
 thus elucidated,     the author deduces the conclusion that, in this
 class, external form, which depends exclusively on plan of growth,
 affords no clue whatever to internal structure; and that the latter
 alone, as the exponent     of the physiological condition of the animal,
 can afford the basis    of a natural classi<U+FB01>cation.

           By Signor CARLO MATTEUCCI, Professor in the University
           of Pisa.  Communicated by MICHAEL Fnmnar, D.C.L.,
            F.R.S. &c.          Received        June    12, 1856.
                                               ( Abstract.)
   In the <U+FB01>rst section of this part of his Memoir, Professor Matteucci
treats of the heat developed by muscles during contraction.       Ad
verting to earlier experiments by other inquirers, in which a rise of
temperature was observed to take place in the contracting muscle
while the blood still ‘continued to circulate                         through       it,   and where,
consequently,           it   remained     uncertain        how far the e<U+FB02>'ect might not be
due to a modi<U+FB01>cation               of the circulation,        the author describes his own
experiments, by which               it   is   shown that the muscles          of frogs, after all
circulation of the blood has                  ceased, and "by the sole act       of contraction,
cause       a   rise   of temperature amounting to about half                   a   degree Centi
grade.
     The second section            is   devoted to the consideration            of the electric
current exhibited by muscles at rest, and experiments                           are adduced        in
illustration of the following propositions :—
     a. The electro-motive power                  of   a   cut muscle   is   independent       of the
size       of its transverse section.
     b. The electro-motive                power      increases with the          length of the
muscle.
      The electro-motive property of the muscles of living or recently
     1:.
killed animals     greater in mammals and birds than in <U+FB01>sh and
                          is
amphibia.              The duration of this force, which in all                 cases decreases
most rapidly in the <U+FB01>rst moments after death,                           is   greater in <U+FB01>sh and
amphibia than in the higher orders                      of animals.
     d. The nerves have no direct in<U+FB02>uence on the electro-motive force
of muscles.             In     general, all causes         which exert       an in<U+FB02>uence on the
physical          structure      and chemical          composition      of muscles,         so as to
modify, in ways unknown, their irritability or contractility, act equally
on     their electro-motive power.
   Prof. Matteucci here takes occasion to state, that he has veri<U+FB01>ed_
 the important discovery of Du Bois Reymond, of the existence of an

                                     210
electric  current   in portions   of nerve detached from the body,-—a
current which, like that of muscle, passes, in the galvanometer, from
the surface of the nerve to the interior.           He adds, that he could
perceive no marked difference in the relative duration of the electro
motive power     of muscle and nerve.
   In  the third section, the author discusses anew, and with the aid
of fresh experiments, the phenomenon originally named by him in
                                                  “
duced contraction, in which the nerve of a          galvanoscopic limb ’’of a
frog, being laid on a muscle    of a living or recently killed animal, is sti
mulated by the contraction of that muscle, so as to cause at the same
moment contraction in the muscles of the galvanoscopic limb.               He
endeavours to show, that this phenomenon is due to an actual electric
discharge,   which takes place in    a muscle at the moment       of contrac
tion, in an opposite direction    to the ordinary current of the muscle
while at rest.    The deviation of the galvanometer-needle during the
contraction   of  a muscle,   which occurs in an opposite direction to
that previously     caused by the      electric  current   generated  by the
muscle while at rest, was ascribed by         M. Du Bois Reymond to the
diminution or cessation of the latter current when the muscle con
tracts, and to the operation in such circumstances          of the secondary
polarity of the platinum plates of the galvanometer.                Professor
Matteucci,   however, adduces various experiments          to show, that, by
certain arrangements      described,   he is able entirely to prevent the
occurrence of secondary polarity, and that nevertheless the deviation
of the needle takes place.
   After adverting to the want of reliable data on which to found an
explanation   of the physical cause of the phenomenon in question, the
author hints, that as there is no analogy between the form of the
voltaic electromotor    and that of the molecular      electromotor, it is not
impossible to conceive that the change         of form which takes place in
a muscle    during contraction may be momentarily followed by the
inversion of the muscular current in the exterior are.           He observes,
that examples are not wanting,       taken from certain cases of electro
dynamic induction,     and also  of voltaic circuits, in which this inversion
of the current can be obtained by a change in the form, or relative
distance of different parts of the circuit; but he adds, that this is a
new <U+FB01>eld of inquiry, which cannot be given up to merely hypothetical
views.

                                         211
  The last section of the paper is devoted to the consideration of the
mechanical effects of muscular contraction; and experiments are
stated with a view to compare the effective work of a muscular con
traction, as determined empirically with the work calculated according
to the principles of the dynamical theory of heat.
  Employing the dynamometer already described in the fourth                  series
of his researches, the author has found that the mechanical work
effected by a single contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle of a
frog may be expressed by 0'00001457 kilogramme-metres.                      Deter
mining next the quantity of zinc required to be oxidated in the pile
in order to excite      a single     contraction,   he <U+FB01>nds that the force de
veloped by the muscle is enormously greater than could be accounted
for on the supposition       it is produced by the conversion into
                              that
muscular energy of the equivalent of electricity corresponding to the
quantity of zinc oxidated.     He accordingly concludes, that the
electric current which excite; a muscle to action does not represent
the    force   exerted by the        muscle, which is more probably          to be
referred   to the chemical         changes, such as oxidation,         which take
place in the muscular tissue during contraction.                The consideration
of this branch of the inquiry will form the subject of the second part
of the Memoir.

   Having been unable to con<U+FB01>rm the statements of Professor Kiilliker
respecting     the cell-structure  of the involuntary muscular <U+FB01>bre, the
author    was   induced to undertake a series of researches into the nature

structure in vertebrate animals, but more especially in man, which
are at variance with those now generally           received.     The present
communication        contains the results of these inquiries, which tend to
show    that the voluntary and involuntary muscles            resemble   each

to the question of the periodic formation and destruction of muscular

tion.     Moreover,      he <U+FB01>nds   that during pregnancy      a considerable
amount     of granular matter, with round or oval granular-cells,            is
deposited     among the <U+FB01>bres.       He adduces reasons for believing that
this substance cannot be regarded         as a blastema,   nor its imbedded
cells as formative cells, for the production      of new <U+FB01>bres; and he is
disposed to ascribe the enlargement of the uterus in pregnancy prin
cipally to the enlargement of the muscular <U+FB01>bres, and the addition of
this new deposit.

      _________—                      213
    The following is   a summary     of the conclusions which the author
has arrived at on the main subject of his inquiry :—
    In both kinds of    muscles, voluntary and involuntary, there is an
interweaving    of the <U+FB01>bres with the formation of meshes.
    The <U+FB01>bres in both kinds are long, slender, rounded cords of uni
form width, except at the ends, where they are <U+FB01>xed by tendinous
tissue; and in both, the      size of the <U+FB01>bres in the  same bundle varies
greatly.
    In  neither  voluntary   nor involuntary muscle is the <U+FB01>bre of the
nature   of a cell, but in both is composed of minute threads or <U+FB01>brils.
Its surface-appearance in both kinds of muscle allows of the supposi
tion that in both it is constructed in a similar way, namely, of small
particles or
              “ sarcous elements,” and that a difference in the
                                                                  arrange
 ment of these elements gives a dotted       appearance to the involuntary
 and a transverse striation to the voluntary <U+FB01>bres.
    The length of the <U+FB01>bres varies in both        cases with the organ or
 part examined, and the connexion with tendon always takes place
 after the same manner, whether the <U+FB01>bre is dotted or striated.
    On the addition of acetic acid, fusiform or rod-shaped corpuscles
 make their appearance in all muscular tissue; these bodies, which
 appear to belong to the sheath      of the <U+FB01>bre, approach nearest in their
 characters to the corpuscles belonging      to the yellow or elastic <U+FB01>bres
 which pervade various other tissues ; and, from the apparent identity
 in nature of these corpuscles in the di<U+FB02>'erent textures in which they

  After stating the results of experiments,                      made under the superin
tendence of the Kew Committee,                  for the construction of           a barometer
tube  of large diameter by the usual method of boiling the mercury
in the tube, the author proceeds to describe a method of <U+FB01>lling a
tube with the aid of an air-pump.     In this process, which is fully
detailed in the paper, the tube is so constructed, that when the air
has been extracted              from    it,   the    mercury       enters by atmospheric
pressure, provision         being made for entirely removing                    the air which
the air-pump has failed                to extract.         By this method        a   barometer
tube   of   1'1   inch internal diameter has been satisfactorily                   prepared at
the Kew Observatory.                The author then describes the mounting and
mode   of observing the standard barometer, proceeds to explain the
processes adopted in the veri<U+FB01>cation of barometers, and gives                                  a
detailed description of the apparatus for determining the errors of
barometers at different atmospheric pressures.

       municated           by     Professor         Sroxas,       Sec.   R.S.         Received
       March        7,    1856.
  In this         paper the author enters into various                   speculations     as   to
the formation and motion of auroral arches.                        Since   it   has been found
by experiment that the maximum length of the voltaic arc with a
given battery        is   nearly the same in atmospheric                   air and in highly
rare<U+FB01>ed      air, forming       a   very perfect       vacuum,       the author conceives
that   a    streamer begins as          a   disruptive     discharge     of <U+FB01>nite and very
moderate length,           (the maximum             length very nearly of        a   continuous
discharge,)       which starts upwards              from    the auroral         arch, which he

                                    _——__——~
                                               215
regards as the discharging              train.      If this    <U+FB01>rst portion be not parallel
                     it is moved laterally by virtue of the earth’s
to the dipping-needle,
magnetism, and thus wrenched, as it were, from the spot where it
was formed, and extinguished.                      If,   however, the discharge, or any
portion of        it,   be parallel to the dipping-needle,»           it   is   not in<U+FB02>uenced
by the earth’s magnetism, and remains.                         To this <U+FB01>rst length another
length may be added by              a   similar process, and         so on, these successive
lengths being all parallel to the direction of the <U+FB01>rst, since otherwise
the streamer would be torn asunder by the lateral motion resulting
from the earth's magnetism.     Thus straight streamer extends up
                                                         a
wards in   direction parallel to the dipping-needle.
              a
    If, from      some increase in the power                 of conduction of the arch, the
base     of the streamer         be not necessarily con<U+FB01>ned to           a   single spot, then
a   streamer may be formed which                 is   somewhat inclined to the dipping
needle    ;   but the consecutive elements of such                  a   streamer must be in
the      same direction,          otherwise        they would have dilferent            lateral
motions,       the streamer would be divided,                    and the discharge would
cease.        The streamer,        as   a   whole,       will move from      east   to west, or
from west to             east,   according     to circumstances.           Those streamers
which would tend to move north or south cannot exist, because
their    bases    would be severed from the auroral arch.
    If   the discharge take place in air not so very highly rare<U+FB01>ed, so
that the disruptive discharge                 is   not quite      of its maximum        length,
consecutive elements need not be quite in the same direction in order
that the streamer may              be unbroken,           and thus curved streamers may
be formed.          It    is   stated by    M. Biot that such have sometimes been
observed.
    The author then enters into some speculations                        as to the nature    of
the auroral arch, which he conceives to consist                         of nebulous matter
highly charged with electricity, and accounts, according to his views,
for the motion of such arches from the pole towards the equator.
    The remainder of the paper                is   occupied with speculations as to the
nature of <U+FB01>re-ball lightning, and other subjects relating to ordinary
electricity.

XVI. “ On     the Lunar-diurnal Magnetic Variation at Toronto.”
       By Major-General Enwann Sanrus, R.A., D.C.L., Treas.
       & V.P.R.S.      Received June 13, 1856.
                               (Abstract.)
   This paper contains the results of an investigation into the moon’s
diurnal in<U+FB02>uence on the horizontal and vertical components of the
magnetic force at Toronto, and the consequent deduction of the lunar
diurnal variations of the inclination and of the total force at that
station.   The observations from which the results were obtained
consisted of <U+FB01>ve years of hourly observation of the bi<U+FB01>lar and ver
tical force magnetometer,    ending  June 30, 1848, from which the
disturbances   of largest amount had been separated    as described  in a
paper previously communicated     (Phil. Trans. 1856, Art. XV.).    The
results derived from the mean of the <U+FB01>ve years are con<U+FB01>rmed by
the accord which is shown     of the means of each of the half-periods
into which the observations     of the <U+FB01>ve years are divided for that
purpose.
   To complete the view of the moon’s diurnal in<U+FB02>uence on the mag
netic elements at Toronto, a recalculation has been made of the
lunar-diurnal variation of the declination from the mean of six years
of hourly observation, ending June 30, 1848, employing         the more
perfect normals derived from the exclusion   of the larger disturbances,
as described in the paper above referred to (Phil. Trans. Art. XV.
 185 6) ; and the con<U+FB01>rmation is shown of the mean result of the six
years by the accordance of three separate portions of two years each,
into which the whole period of six years has been divided for that
purpose.
   From these premises the author draws the following conclusions :
    1. The three magnetic elements concur in showing that the moon
exercises a sensible magnetic    in<U+FB02>uence at the surface   of the earth,
producing in every lunar day a variation which is distinctly appre
ciable, in each of the three elements, by the instruments adopted and
recommended     in the Report of the Committee       of Physics of the
 Royal Society, when due care is taken in conducting        the observa
tions, and suitable methods are employed in elaborating the results.

                                              217
    2. That the lunar diurnal variation                in each of the three elements
constitutes   a double progression              in each lunar day; the declination
having two easterly and two westerly maxima, and the inclination
and total force each two maxima and two minima between two suc
cessive passages  of the moon over the astronomical meridian; the
variation passing in every case four times through zero in the lunar
day.    The approximate range of the lunar-diumal variation at T0
ronto is 38" in the declination,              4"'5 in the inclination, and '0000l2
parts   of the total force.
    3. That the lunar-diurnal variation                thus    obtained appears to be
consistent    with the hypothesis              that the moon’s magnetism               is,   in
great part at least          if   not wholly, derived by induction from                  the
magnetism     of the earth.
    4. That there       is    no appearance in the lunar-diurnal variation                   of
the decennial period, which constitutes so marked                         a   feature in the
solar diurnal variations.

        F.R.S.         Received June 19, 1856.
                                           (Abstract.)
    An autopolar polyedron             is    such, that any type or description that
can be given      of   it   remains unaltered, when summits are put for faces,
and faces for summits.               To every ,6-gon     B    in   it   corresponds a ,8-ace
b   (or summit     b    of   L3   edges), which may be called the pole               of that
,6-gon;    and to every edge            AB, between the a-gon             A   and the /3-gon
 B, corresponds         an edge ab, between the a-ace a and the /3-ace                       b.
 Two such     edges are called         a   gamic    pair, or pair qfgamice.
    The enumeration of autopolar p-edra                   is   here entered upon as           a
 step   towards                    of the number of p-edra.
                   the determination                           The
 theorems following are established, and shown to be of importance
                                                  I
 for the solution of the general problem.
     THEOREM       I.—No polyedron,              not a pyramid, has every edge both
 in a triangle and in         a    triace.

                                             218
    Def.   An    edge    of  a polyedron       is said to convanesce,     when its two
summits run into one          ;  and   it is said to    evanesce,  when its two faces
revolve into one.
    An   edge   (AB)      is said to be convanescible,          when neither of the
faces  A  and   B is   a triangle,     and   (AB) joins     two summits which have
not two collateral faces, one in either summit, besides                 A  and   B.
    An  edge   (ab) is said to        be evaneacible, when neither a nor b is a
triace, and the two faces about (ab) are not, one in either, in two
collateral summits, besides a and b.
    Trrnomam      II.--Every polyedron,             not a pyramid, has either a con
vanescible or an evanescible edge.
    THEOREM       III.—Any p-edral               q-acron,   not a pyramid,        can be
reduced by the vanishing           of an   edge, either to a   (p—1)-edral q-acron,
or to a p-edral      (q—l)-acron.
    By such    a reduction       of a p-edral q-acron       P to P’, of P'  to  P", &c.,
P  can be shown to be generable from a certain pyramid                   II ;  by which
it is meant that      11  is the highest-ranked          pyramid to which      P  can   by
such reduction be reduced.
    Hereby it is evident that the problem of enumeration of the                    ac-edra
is brought down to           this: to determine how many (r+m)-edra are
generable   from the r-edral pyramid.
    The autopolars      so generable are        <U+FB01>rst considered,   as the heteropolars
are obtained by combination              and selection of those operations with
which the theory of the autopolars makes us acquainted.
    Autopolarity is of three kinds, nodal, enodal, and utral.
    Every even-based pyramid is nodally autopolar; i. e. it cannot
but have two nodal summits.                       For example, the 5-edral and
7-edral pyramids         have the signatures           of their   faces  and summits
thus arranged,—
                   1234                               123456
                    4321                               654321’
the upper line showing the triangles, and the lower the triaces about
the base, which as well as its pole the vertex, is signed zero.                 The two
triaces in the triangle        5  are 3 and     2; the two triangles in the triace
 l are 6 and   l in ‘the    7-edron, and 4 and         1 in the 5-edron.      The nodal
summits     and faces are 3 and            l in   the 5-edron, and 4 and        l in   the
 7-edron.     No other mode of autopolar signature is possible in these.

                                                   219
        Every odd-based pyramid is utrally autopolar.                         The 6-edral and
    8-edral pyramids may receive either of the signatures following                         :
                    I2345                                1234567
                    54321                                7654321
                    12345                                1234567
                    45123                                5671234’
    the <U+FB01>rst     of which lines exhibits nodal            faces and summits 31 and              4],
    while in the second every triangle is opposite its polar triace, and no
                                                                          7
    face or summit is nodal.
        No pyramid is enodally autopolar,                  i.   e. capable     of only enodal
    signature.      If we         draw a 7-gon whose summits are 1234567,                       and
    then the dotted lines 73 and 75, and next taking three points in                             it,
    complete the 5-gon 34089,                and   join 93, 92, 81, 87, 06, 05, 04, we
    can sign the faces thus           :—
     045=1, 506=2, 6087=3, 78l=4, l892=5, 293=6, 39804=7,
    237l=0, 3754=8, 567= 9. The type now represents an enodally
'
    autopolar      10-edron, in which no pair of gamics meet each other, or
    can by any autopolar             arrangement be made to meet.               The    18 edges
    of the solid    are      well represented thus, the odd places in            a   quadruplet
    showing summits, and the even, faces                 :—
          1520     2630       3748     4158     5269      6379         7410   0783     8795

    The gamic pairs stand together, and no quadruplet                           exhibits    fewer
    than four numbers.                A   nodally autopolar           must always be, and        a
    utrally autopolar may always be                 so signed, that two pairs          of gamics
    shall exhibit in each quadruplet                 a   duad        of the form aa.       In the
    above type     it   is   observable that every duad, as 15, occurs four times.
    The    same   thing      is   to be seen in every autopolar type           of edges.

  1.    “Chemical         Examination      of Burmese        Naphtha,       or Ran
          goon Tar._”        By WARREN DE LA RUE, Ph.D., F.R.S.,
          and Huoo MGLLER, Ph.D.                Received August 1, 1856.
      In   several localities   of the kingdom of Burmah, there emanates
  from the soil in considerable quantity a peculiar oleaginous substance,
 which is employed for         a variety of purposes, but chie<U+FB02>y          as a lamp
 fuel and as an unguent,           by the natives, and exported in moderate
 quantities under the name of Burmese naphtha, or Rangoon tar.
     It  is obtained by sinking wells     of about   60 feet   in depth, in which
 the liquid is collected by the miner as it oozes from the soil.
     At the common temperature this substance has the consistence of
 goose-fat;     it is lighter than water, has usually a greenish-brown
 colour, and possesses a slight odour, peculiar, but not disagreeable.
 It   consists almost entirely of volatile constituents.
     Burmese      naphtha    has already    attracted    the attention      of other
 chemists;      at present we refrain     from entering      into  a discussion    of
 their results,     since it is our intention to give a full history          of this
remarkable natural product when, after the completion                 of our expe
riments, we shall have the honour         of submitting to the Royal Society
adetailed account of our investigation.                The object   of’ the present
communication         is to trace a mere outline    of the results     at  which we
have    arrived up to this moment.
     The circumstances        under which petroleum—i'o1'         this is the col
lective term which comprehends             a great variety     of oily emanations
similar to Burmese naphtha—0ccurs in nature, all tend to prove that
these substances are the products          of a slow destructive     distillation of
the residuary matter of’ a primeval creation         :  this being admitted, the
     VOL.    VIII.                                                    T

  idea naturally suggested itself of examining          this substance in com
                                                                          '
  parison with the products of arti<U+FB01>cial destructive distillation.
      With this view, one of us* was induced to procure, through the
  intervention of a friend, several tons of Rangoon tar, which was care
  fully collected at the source, and transmitted to Europe in well-secured
  vessels.    Our experience in the course of this inquiry, has shown
  that this quantity,      large as it may appear,       was by no means too
  ample a supply.      Burmese naphtha contains indeed so great a variety
  of substances, and      some   of them in   so exceedingly minute a    propor
  tion, that even the large amount of material at our disposal was            in
   su<U+FB02>icient  for the complete examination         of several constituents,  the
  presence of which we had succeeded in establishing           beyond a doubt.
   As an example, we may state that Burmese naphtha contains small
   quantities of organic bases, the study of which we were compelled to
   postpone to a later period, when an additional          quantity of material,
   which is now on its way to Europe, will have come to hand.
      We have already mentioned that Rangoon tar is almost entirely
   volatile, and preliminary experiments proved to us that the distilla
   tion could  be effected most conveniently,       and with less danger of ob
   taining products    of decomposition, in a current of steam ; <U+FB01>rst of a
   temperature of 100° C. (2l2° F.), and subsequently of steam super
   heated by passing, before it entered the still, through a system of
   pipes the temperature of which could be regulated.             Treated in this
   way, it furnishes 96 per cent.      of volatile products, <U+FB02>uid and solid.
      Steam of 100° C.      (2l2°       carries over  11  per cent. of a volatile
   oil perfectly free from solid hydrocarbons, which at that tempera
   ture are entirely retained in the distillatory apparatus.         Between the
   temperatures of 110° and 145° C. (230°—293° F.), 10 per cent. of a
   further distillate is obtained, which is almost free from solid hydro
   carbons.    The temperature        may be raised to       160° C. (320°
   without materially augmenting          this per-centage; but on gradually
‘
   increasing the temperature       of the steam to the fusion-point of lead,
   the operation yields 20 additional per cent. of distillate, which retains
   its <U+FB02>uidity at 0° C. (32° F.), notwithstanding the presence in it of an
   appreciable quantity of solid matter.          At this stage of the process
   the products     of distillation begin to solidify on cooling, and about
    31 per cent.  of a crystalline  material is obtained sut<U+FB01>ciently consistent
                                  * Warren De la Rue.

to be submitted      to pressure.    After this the consistence of the pro
ducts of distillation begins to diminish; and whilst the temperature
of the steam is considerably raised, 21 per cent. of a mixture of solids
and liquids distil, the latter predominating especially as the operation
proceeds.
    In  the last stage of the process the distillate completely changes its
character, becoming very dark in colour, of a pitch-like consistence,
and exhibiting scarcely an indication         of the presence of crystalline
matter.      When this product, which amounts to about              3 per cent.,
has passed over, there remains in the still a coke-like mass, which
contains a small quantity of earthy impurities.
    Although there is     a considerable difference between the speci<U+FB01>c gra
vities  of the <U+FB01>rst and last fractions of the distillates, all the products
of distillation,   like the original oil, are lighter than water, and could
be separated therefore       by means   of the well-known apparatus (called
a  Florentine <U+FB02>ask) employed in the distillation of essential oils.
    By exposing the distillates obtained beyond the temperature of
 145° C. (293°           to a freezing   mixture,    nearly all the crystalline
matter solidi<U+FB01>ed,      and became removeable by means of <U+FB01>ltration and
pressure.      It was thus ascertained that Rangoon tar contains from
 10 to 11 per cent.     of solid constituents (para<U+FB02>in).
                               Solid Constituents.
    The solid product,       when removed from the <U+FB02>uid hydrocarbons,
 still retains  a portion of the latter with much obstinacy; in order to
purify the solid, it has to be subjected to the action of boiling con
centrated sulphuric acid, and to be subsequently washed, <U+FB01>rst with
an alkaline solution, then with water.        On redistillation,  the para<U+FB02>in is
obtained quite white, but even now         it still retains some <U+FB02>uid hydro
carbons which have resisted the action of the sulphuric acid; the
greater part can be removed by pressure between folds of cloth in a
powerful hydraulic press and subsequent exposure for some months
to the air, in which the <U+FB02>uids gradually disperse.                 By fractional
crystallization from hot alcohol,      we have been enabled to separate the
solid product into at least two distinct compounds, which appear to
have the same per-centage composition, agreeing either with C, H, or
C, H,,+,, but which differ from each other in their physical properties.
By the action <U+FB01>rst of sulphuric acid saturated with anhydrous acid,
                                                                 'r 2

                                         224
 then with anhydrous         sulphuric acid itself,     we believe that we shall
 obtain compounds which will enable us to determine a rational for
 mula for each of these interesting bodies.
                               Liquid Constituents.
     In order   to purify the liquid constituents of Burmese naphtha, they
 were, after the separation of the solid portion from such as contained
 any, twice redistilled in a current of steam, <U+FB01>rst of 100° C. (.2l2° F.),
 and subsequently of superheated steam, the temperature of which
 was gradually raised.         In  the redistillation,    however, steam of only
  100° C.    (2l2°       was found to carry over <U+FB02>uids which boiled at a
  temperature as high as 300° C. (572°
     A further separation of the various               products   was effected by
 repeated fractional      distillations;   but no absolutely constant boiling
 points could be obtained, notwithstanding             the great number of distil
 lations and the large quantity          of material at command.         It is true
 that considerable portions         of distillates    could be collected between
 certain ranges of temperature, tending to indicate a constant boiling
 point; nevertheless it soon became evident that distillation alone
 could not effect the separation of the various constituents, and that
/recourse must be had to other processes.                The employment of con
 centrated sulphuric acid <U+FB01>rst suggested itself, and by its means a
 whole group of hydrocarbons           could be removed from the distillates,
 the residue consisting       of hydrocarbons,        on which   it had no action.
 This    was   an important      step; but recourse was subsequently had,
 with   even more success,      to the action of strong nitric or a mixture of
 nitric and sulphuric acids, by which means a series of nitro-compounds
 were obtained, which presented the advantage of being more easily
 studied than the sulpho-acids.           The nitric-acid method, which has
 already been described at some length*,              promises to be of general
 applicability in the separation of complex mixtures of hydrocarbons,
 and has, in the hands of Mr. C. Greville Williamsf, been lately em
ployed     with  advantage   in the  investigation     of “ Some of the products
 of the distillation of Boghead Coal at low temperatures.”

     Hydrocarbons separable by Sulphuric Acid and                    Nitric Acid.
    The proportion of hydrocarbons removeable from the various distil
lates by means of concentrated sulphuric acid, nitric acid, or a mix
ture of both acids, is in most cases small when compared with the
part not acted upon ; it increases generally, however, with the boiling
point of the <U+FB02>uid, varying from less than one-tenth to nearly one-third
part of the original compound-hydrocarbon.                     The nitro-compounds
obtained by means of strong nitric acid are <U+FB02>uids at the lower end of
the series, whilst with hydrocarbons              boiling above 200°C. (392° F
they are of a resinous consistence           ;  they frequently retain with obsti
nacy a portion of the not-acted-upon                 hydrocarbons,    and more espe
cially  if the experiment       be conducted           upon   a small    scale  ;  nitro
compounds     are sometimes obtained which <U+FB02>oat upon water, in con
sequence of this retention of the lighter hydrocarbons.
    In submitting    the hydrocarbons to the action of the acids, we have
invariably selected <U+FB02>uids which from their boiling-points appeared to
be  within certain limits homogeneous; but notwithstanding every pos
sible care in this selection, we have always obtained more than one
 sulpho-acid and more than one nitro-compound,                  as the case  might    be,
 and we have experienced very considerable di<U+FB02>iculties in the separa
 tion of the mixed products.           In   the case of nitro-compounds,          advan
 tage has sometimes been taken             of their convertibility by        a mixture
 of sulphuric and nitric acids into di- and tri-nitro-compounds, which
 admitted of fractional crystallization from various media.                    We have
 been thus enabled to isolate the following compounds, the analysis and
 properties of which place their existence beyond doubt, namely,—
                        Nitrobenzol,
                        Dinitrotoluol;
                        Trinitroxylol,
                        Sulphocumolate           of barium    ;
 and therefore  it is evident that the Burmese naphtha products contain
 the corresponding     hydrocarbons,         namely,—
                        Benzol.    . . . . . . . . .    C12 H6
                        Toluol   . . . . . . . . . .

                                       226
  But   we have found     that the foregoing        are by no means the only
  hydrocarbons    separated by sulphuric acid and nitric acid, and we
  hope to establish the existence of other series containing            terms iso
_ meric with, but differing    in properties      from,   benzol and its homo
  logues;   we have, moreover,       good reason to suspect the presence         of
  other compounds even less linked with the benzol series.
           Action  of Reducing Agents       on the Nitro-compounds.
     In order to throw further light on the constitution of the hydro
  carbons in Burmese naphtha, removeable by the before-named acids,
  we have    submitted   the several nitro-compounds           to the action     of
  reducing agents.     As was to be expected, our nitrobenzol yielded an
  abundant supply of aniline when distilled with acetic acid and iron
  turnings, thus con<U+FB01>rming the existence of benzol beyond all possible
  doubt.    In a similar manner the presence of toluol was further esta
  blished by the preparation      of nitrotoluol and toluidine.        Béchamp’s
  method    was, however,    not equally applicable         in all cases,  so  that
  Zinin’s original sulphide of ammonium            process was resorted     to; by
  its means we have obtained        several new bases, and among them one
  crystallizing beautifully in long needles, having the appearance and
  colour of alizarine.   Some time must ‘however elapse before the great
  number of new bodies can be fully studied.
      Hydrocarbons not acted upon by Sulphuric and Nitric Acids.
      The hydrocarbons which resist the action of monohydrated sul
  phuric and nitric acids form, as has been before stated, by far the
  larger  portion of the distillates     obtained      from   Burmese     naphtha.
  When puri<U+FB01>ed by washing from adhering acid, by fractional distilla
  tion, and <U+FB01>nally by recti<U+FB01>cation in a current of dry hydrogen gas over
  the liquid alloy of potassium      and sodium,       they are obtained almost
  inodorous   and perfectly   colourless.       Thus puri<U+FB01>ed, they are very
  <U+FB02>uid, and retain their <U+FB02>uidity even        in the intense cold produced by
  a mixture of solid carbonic acid and ether.               No absolute <U+FB01>xity of
  boiling-point could   be obtained    in any of the products; nevertheless
  a much greater constancy      in this respect was observed than with the
  hydrocarbons   before treatment with strong acids.          The lowest boiling
  point obtained   was 50°   C. (l22°         ;  the highest, being far beyond
  the range of the mercurial      thermometer,       was not ascertained.      The

                    ____—             227
speci<U+FB01>c heat of the vapour        of all this    series  of hydrocarbons   was
ascertained to be very small, a fact which we believe accounts in
some    measure for the difficulties      we   experienced in the fractional
distillations.   For the purpose of analysis,    we have contented ourselves
with selecting such products as boiled within the same 5° C. (9°
of the thermometric scale. All the analyses tend to_prove-that the
ratio   of carbon to hydrogen increases slowly with an increase in the
boiling-point,    and to negative the not improbable assumption of the
carbon and hydrogen        being   combined in equal equivalents.          The
general formula Cn H,,+, agrees best with our results, and indicates a
probability of the Burmese naphtha            containing   several radicals or
their hydrides.
   Our endeavours       to  obtain    de<U+FB01>nite    substitution-compounds     by
means     of bromine and chlorine have      been attended    with only partial
success.      Chlorine gas  acts slowly in the dark, but more quickly
with the aid of diffused daylight; pentachloride of antimony, on the
other hand, acts with so much violence that explosions frequently
ensue.
   Bromine appears to separate the hydrocarbons into two distinct
bodies, a circumstance which throws some doubt upon their simple
constitution.      Hydrated sulphuric acid saturated with the anhydrous
acid likewise produces a separation of the hydrocarbons,             absorbing
one portion and leaving the other unaoted upon          ; anhydrous sulphuric
acid, on the other hand, in some cases completely absorbs the whole,
sometimes with evolution of sulphurous acid.            The copulated sulpho
acids which are produced        in  these   cases  will probably enable us to
clear up the enigma of the composition of the hydrocarbons; We
think it better therefore not to lay much stress upon the Radical or
Hydride hypotheses until further experiment has thrown more light
upon the subject.       Nevertheless     we   may state,    that by operating
upon a <U+FB02>uid boiling between 90° and 100° C. (l94°—2l2°                     with
chlorine for     some  months,    we   at last obtained a cessation of all
action, and a chlorine compound resulted, which, when puri<U+FB01>ed and
analysed,     gave  numbers agreeing perfectly with         C26 H22 C16, corre
sponding      to a hydrocarbon,    C,6 H28, a formula with which the ana
lysis of the original hydrocarbon        was perfectly consistent, although
its boiling-point pointed rather to      a lower formula.

           Action  of Oxidising  Agents on the Hydrocarbons.
   By the action of boiling diluted nitric acid, continued for many
months,     on  the  hydrocarbons     not . acted upon   by    concentrated
sulphuric and nitric acids, oxidation gradually takes place, and a
great variety of acids are produced, among which we have isolated
succinic acid, and several others belonging to the series Cn H,,_2 O8.
   Oxalic acid, the lowest term of this series, could not be traced;
there occurs, however, in these products several of the volatile acids
of the acetic acid   series, but in very small quantities.       The rough
distillates obtained from the Burmese naphtha, when treated in the
same    manner, yield,   in addition to the foregoing, several aromatic
acids, derivatives of the benzol series and its isomers, differing however
from any acids at present known.        Other oxidizing agents have been
employed by us, but not with such marked results.

          Microscopic    Examination        of the Circulation of the Blood
          in the Vessels of the Iris and of the Choroid Membrane,
          &c.”    By Auousros WALLER, M.D., F.R.S.                      Received
          July  10, 1856.
                                    (Abstract.)
      In  a former paper on the section      of the optic nerve, the author   de
  scribed a process  of producing temporary extrusion of the eyeball from
  the socket in the living animal.       Although adopted in the <U+FB01>rst instance
_merely for the purpose of dividing the optic nerve de vi-su with as
  little injury as possible, the same means      of exposing the eyeball may be
 advantageously employed for studying various other points relating to
  the physiology   of the  eye.   In the <U+FB01>rst place,   as the eyeball is so much
 protruded from the orbit, Kepler's experiment on the eye removed
 from the body, showing that external objects form inverted images
 on the retina, may be performed on the living animal.          For this purpose
 it is merely requisite to place        a bright object obliquely before the
pupil, a candle for instance, in order to ascertain that        a reversed image
of it is formed on the opposite side of the           eye.   On   a young  rabbit
     VOL.   VIII.                                                   U

                                          230
 placed in a dark room, particularly           if  an albino animal is used, the
 inverted image of the candle, although having to traverse the choroid,
 the sclerotic and the muscular            parts, is perceived bright, and tole
 rably well de<U+FB01>ned.        When this bright spot is examined with a lens
 or a compound microscope, it is found to he suf<U+FB01>ciently illuminated
 to allow of the examination of the motion of the globules of the
 blood.    On the young guinea-pig the same may be still more easily
  examined, but it is particularly the albino rat or surmulot (Mus
 decumam/ss) that the author has found most suitable for these obser
 vations,  exophthalmosis        being most easily produced on this animal,
 while the   eye is so transparent        and the iris so close to the cornea,
 that the circulation of the blood-globules in the         vessels of the iris may
 be observed.      At the    same     time, beneath the iris and sclerotic may
 be seen the    ciliary  processes     from their origin at the ora serrata to
 their anterior extremity, where they are seen to form a circular crown
 with a serrated edge surrounding the crystalline lens. The vessels
 of the ciliary ligament of the choroid are likewise rendered accessible
 to actual inspection during life.
    For the purpose of examination, the animal is secured by                  a few
 turns of a band, about       1%
                                   inch in width, passed round its body       so as
to con<U+FB01>ne the limbs.          It  is then placed on a narrow slip      of cork, to
which it is <U+FB01>xed by       some turns      of string.    When steadily <U+FB01>xed, ex
ophthalmosis is produced and maintained by passing a strong thread
around the slip      of cork and the head of the animal close to the eye,
alternately in front and behind it.           When the compound microscope
is used, it   will  be found     requisite to place the animal sidewise, so as
to direct the object-glass          over the bright image above mentioned,
 which is always formed when the eye is placed before any bright
light.
    The author <U+FB01>rst describes the vessels of the conjunctiva over the
sclerotic and cornea.          These vessels      form a network     behind     and
 before the ciliary ligament,           and join into numerous      small trunks
which unite with       a circular    ciliary vein running all round the ciliary
ligamenlt.     In   the corneal conjunctiva the vessels may be traced
 towards the summit of the cornea over the outer              half of its surface,
 and even beyond.        They     are seen   to commence internally, as if with
 free extremities,    from    whence the blood is seen circulating         rapidly
towards the circumference of the cornea.                Then large meshes soon

                                                 231
 form, which become smaller                  as they approach            the ciliary ligament,
 where they terminate in a circular vein surrounding the cornea.                                 The
 rapid circulation of the blood at the apparent extremities of the ves
 sels over the inner parts of the cornea, indicates their further con
 tinuation inwards or below, although the author has not traced them
 further over the cornea.
      The     vessels       of the anterior surface of the iris, which Dr. W.
 next examines, consist of arteries and veins.                       The former are derived
almost entirely from the two long ciliary arteries which arrive near the
outer and inner angles of the eye, their course being traced over the
anterior half of the sclerotic until they reach the great circumference
of the iris, where they each subdivide into two equal branches, one
inferior, the other superior, which diverge at an obtuse angle, each of
them running in an oblique direction                    towards the edge             of the pupil
until they attain the inner third of the iris, where most of the <U+FB01>nal
subdivisions      are bent outwards.             These four oblique branches form a
symmetrical        <U+FB01>gure       of   a lozenge-shape         over the          iris, each branch
giving      of internal and         external twigs, the former ending in the small
circumference,         the latter in the large circumference                   of the iris.      The
course      of the blood may          be watched       in    these vessels from over the
sclerotic to their termination              in the iris, but in general the current
is too rapid to allow of the detection of the direction of the separate
particles     of the blood.          It   is only when the circulation becomes lan
guid that the separate globules can be                      seen    distinctly running in          a
centrifugal      arterial) direction.
                 (i.   e.
   By compressing the eye slightly, the passage of the blood may                                  be
retarded, and by that means be easily followed; but in so doing                                   an
error may possibly be committed respecting the arterial nature of
these vessels, as the course of the blood then generally reversed in
                                                            is
the arteries, and will be seen to take            a   centripetal direction, sometimes
for upwards of         a    minute, according to the amount                   of pressure.    But
in   a   short time, after oscillating within the                  vessels,    the blood again
resumes its natural course, which may be sufficiently                                regulated    to
enable us to watch the passage               of the globules in the oblique branches
and      in their internal and external subdivisions.
   The veins of the iris form two layers. The super<U+FB01>cial layer com
prises all the larger veins-—-generally twenty-three or twenty-four
in  number,—wbich radiate in regular manner from the pupil out
                                             a
                                                                                 U   2

                                      232
wards towards the ciliary ligament.        They arise at the pupillary edge,
each by two or three <U+FB01>ne twigs, which quickly meet in a common
trunk, or sometimes run separately as far          as the outer    half of the
iris, where they unite in a common trunk.
    The deep layer consists almost entirely of       a <U+FB01>ne network     belong
ing to the radiating muscular <U+FB01>bres, and presenting a close analogy
with the <U+FB01>ne vessels supplying striated muscular <U+FB01>bre; the vessels
being very minute, and the meshes elongated in the direction             of the
<U+FB01>bres.      Sometimes    the vessels from this layer unite       into  a small
ramuscule, which empties into a radiating vein ; at others they unite
in a common trunk, passing beneath the ciliary ligament into the
 choroid.
    The movement of the blood in the veins is generally not too rapid
 to distinguish the direction    of the current and the separate globules,
 which appear to be constantly springing from around the edge of the
 pupil and pouring outwards along the veins of the iris into the cho
 roidal and ciliary vessels.
    When the pupil is contracted, the radiating       vessels are  rectilinear;
but when it dilates they become curved and bent into zigzag and
 spiral forms, which are more or less curved or obtuse in proportion to
 the degree     of dilatation of the pupil.     This change in the form of
 the vessels does not appear to produce any difference in the speed of
 the current of blood.
    Around the ciliary ligament     are two and often three   circular vessels,
 receiving the blood from the conjunctiva       of the cornea and sclerotic,
 partly from the iris, and probably from the ciliary processes.            Two
 of them     are venous,   and empty      themselves  into four large veins,
 corresponding     to the anterior ciliaries, which arise in a perpendicular
 direction,   and after following a rectilinear   course over the sclerotic,
 <U+FB01>nally end in the ophthalmic vein.          The third circular ciliary vessel
 is  of an arterial nature,   as shown     by the greater thickness       of its
 parietes and the rapidity    of its current.
    The current of blood in these vascular circles is      a most interesting
 object from the variety of its course, as into each anterior ciliary vein
 the blood is seen pouring out from the circular vein in two opposite
 currents, to be united into one in the larger vessel.       The author.also
 describes the appearance       presented    by the blood poured into the
 circular veins by their afferent vessels.

    II.   “Researches        on the Action of certain parts of the Solar
             Spectrum upon the       Iris.”    By E. BROWN Sisqualtn, M.D.
            Communicated         by    Dr.   SHARPEY,         Sec. R.S.       Received
            July I0,     1856.
       In 1847     I   discovered that light has the power of acting directly
   upo°n     the iris so as to produce there a muscular contraction,              mani
   festing itself by the constriction        of the pupil.      If  an eye taken out
   from the orbit is alternately exposed to light and darkness, we <U+FB01>nd
   that the pupil becomes alternately constricted and dilated*.
       It  was interesting to know whether the stimulation               of the mus
   cular <U+FB01>bres of the iris is produced by the chemical power                of light or
  not.        I had already found, in 1847, that only the parts of light
  which seem to have but very little chemical action, have the power
  of exciting       contractions   in the iris.    But my experiments having
  been      made with light passing through coloured               glasses, were not
  decisive.        Lately    I have performed      many      other   experiments     in
  making use of light decomposed by the prism. In one case, with
  the assistance of Messrs. Dubosc and Nachet, jun.,                  I experimented
  with electric light, and in the other cases               I  made use of direct
  solar light.
      In all    these cases the same results have been obtained.                 I uni
 formly found that the yellow part of the spectrum acted                     as well as
 undecomposed light, and that the other parts of the spectrum had
 either no action at all, or only a very slight one.              The parts of the
 green and orange adjoining the yellow had a decided but very slow
 action.        The two extremities of the spectrum, and the dark places
 in their neighbourhood,          not only had no constrictive           action   upon
the pupil,        but did not prevent it from dilating, and the dilatation
seemed to take place as quickly as when the eye was put in complete
darkness.
     From these experiments it appears that the power possessed by
light, of stimulating the circular <U+FB01>bres of the iris, belongs not to its
chemical        or to its calori<U+FB01>c    parts, but to its illuminating elements.

                                              234
It   seems     therefore that it is not by a chemical                     action,   but by a
peculiar      dynamical    in<U+FB02>uence         that light produces contraction             of the
iris.
     The power of the iris to contract when stimulated by light lasts
extremely long, particularly in certain animals.                         In   the eel   I   have
found the muscular irritability of the iris, in one case, lasting sizvteen
days, during the last winter, in eyes taken out from the orbit.      This
is an interesting  fact, not only on account of the long duration of
vitality in the iris, but on account of the conclusion that we are
entitled      to draw from         it,   that muscular         <U+FB01>bres may be stimulated
without the intervention            of nerves.      In       the iris of the eel the nerve
<U+FB01>bres are found very much altered               a   few days after the extirpation            of
the eye from          the orbit,     and they are almost               destroyed    twelve or
<U+FB01>fteen days after this extirpation,                i.   e.   at   a   time where muscular
irritability    is   sometimes still existing.

resumed and concluded.
                                   (Abstract)
   The only instrument which has been applied to the measurement
of the chemical action of light was proposed in 1843 by Dr. Draper
of New York.          The sensitive substance employed by him was           a
mixture of chlorine and hydrogen,         and by measuring the diminution
ensuing onexposure to light, he experimentally determined some
important relations of photo-chemical action. Draper’s instrument
is,   however,   not adapted for accurate measurements,     owing,     in the
<U+FB01>rst place, to the fact that the gas    subject to varying pressure;
                                             is
and, in the second place, that the statical equilibrium, which must
exist between the free and dissolved gases, in order that the free gas
should consist of equal volumes of chlorine and hydrogen, was never
approached.
      In order   to obtain more accurate results   than was possible with
Draper’s tithonometer,      we sought for means    of preparing   a   gas con
taining equal volumes of chlorine and hydrogen;            this means was
found, notwithstanding Draper’s contrary statement, in the electro

                                         236
 lysis of strong aqueous hydrochloric acid.              A   series    of volumetric
 analyses proved that the gas thus evolved consisted, as soon as the
 requisite saturation had been attained, of exactly equal volumes                of its
 component parts, and did not contain the slightest trace                   of oxygen
‘or oxides   of chlorine.      Another series of experiments with gas, simi
 larly prepared, but allowed to stand before analysis for many hours
 in the dark in closed vessels, proved that, at the ordinary atmospheric
 temperature,    the gases do not enter into combination              when the   light
 is excluded.      Being thus enabled to prepare               a  substance     which
 undergoes decomposition         on exposure to light, but does not change
 on preservation in the dark, we proceeded to construct                an apparatus
 by means    of which the laws of the chemical action of light might be
 thoroughly investigated.         After many fruitless         attempts,     we have
 succeeded in constructing       an instrument,      by which not only accurate
 comparative     determinations     can be made, but which has enabled us
 to reduce the chemical action of light to an absolute measure.
    The most essential conditions           ful<U+FB01>lled by our instrument         are the
 following   :-              '
    1.  A   continuous    evolution     of   a gas  consisting    of exactly equal
 volumes of chlorine and hydrogen free from all foreign impurities.
    2.  Constant pressure on the gas and liquids throughout the appa
                                     '
 ratus.
    3. Absence of all caoutchouc or other organic matter which might
 alter the composition      of the gas.
    4. Exclusion     of all variation in the composition of the gas in the
 apparatus from exposing the saturated liquids to the light.
    5. Complete establishment          of the statical equilibrium between the
                                          '
 free and dissolved gases.                                   .  -   .     .
    6. Elimination     of the disturbing action of radiant heat.
    The instrument       in which these conditions           are ful<U+FB01>lled is con
 structed entirely   of glass, and consists essentially of four parts, viz.—
 1, a decomposing tube inwhich the gases are generated from carbon
poles;    2, a washing     tube containing        water, furnished with an air
tight glass stopcock; 3, the        vessel    in which the   gases are exposed      to
the action    of the light attached to the other parts of the apparatus
by air-tight ground-glass joints; and 4, a horizontal tube on which
 the diminution of volume          in the insolation      vessel is observed by
 means of a millimeter scale.

                                                   237
     When the apparatus is freshly <U+FB01>lled with the requisite quantity of
water,      the pure electrolytic              gas is allowed             to pass through, certain
necessary precautions               being used, until a constant source                        of light,
such as a coal-gas <U+FB02>ame burning under                                certain     circumstances, pro
duces      in equal times always the                 same        alteration        of volume.         This
constant maximum                  action is generally not reached until from eight
to ten      litres of        gas have passed            through the instrument,                  and the
saturation has continued for from three to six days.                                   As soon, how
ever, as     this maximum is attained, the instrument is ready for use,
and       preserves                            for many weeks, requiring
                        this constantsensibility
only a      short saturation each day in order to <U+FB01>t it for accurate photo
chemical measurements.
     On exposing the           light, the quantity of hydrochloric
                                  gas to the
acid formed does not at once attain the maximum: a certain time
often elapses before any alteration                     of volume is perceptible;                a   slight
action      is,   however, soon observed, and this gradually increases until
the permanent            maximum          This phenomenon, to which
                                         is     reached.
we    have given the name of photo-chemical induction,  one of great                   is
interest and importance,                and      will     be specially studied              in our next
section.          As the maximum action                 is   not attained for several minutes
after the <U+FB01>rst exposure, the observations can only be made use                                       of   as
soon as the action for several successive minutes has become con
stant.       By    a   combination           of several actual observations, the                     di<U+FB01>"er
ences between the indications                   are found to be very slight.

  A       special investigation          was conducted                for the purpose of deter
mining the          etfect    produced        by the heat evolved from the slow com
bustion of the chlorine and hydrogen.                                Experiment and calculation
gave the following as some of the more important results                                    :—
     1.   That the heat evolved in the insolation vessel from the com
bustion of the         gases exerts no perceptible                   in<U+FB02>uence on the indications
of the instrument.
     2. That the slight diminution in volume which occurs in the <U+FB01>rst
few seconds after exclusion                   of light,   is   entirely owing to        a   decrease      of
temperature from              a   cessation of the combustion.

    In order fully to test our apparatus, we have observed the action
effected by a coal-gas <U+FB02>ame of constant dimensions on our apparatus
 on different days.    Determinations       made in      June last gave the follow
 ing results :-—
                              Action in   1 min.       Diff. from mean.

    Observations   made with the constant              <U+FB02>ame placed      at different
known distances from the insolation           vessel,     proved that the amount
of chemical action produced varied inversely as the square of the
distance; and experiments made in September with the standard
<U+FB02>ame gave results which agreed most exactly with those obtained in
June.     From the exact agreement of these various observations we
are assured   of the accuracy and reliability of the measurements made
with our instrument.
   In  order to see whether the variation of the atmospheric tempera
ture exerted any in<U+FB02>uence on the sensibility               of the electrolytic gas,
we saturated the apparatus         at various      temperatures      lying between
 18° and 27° C., and found that the difference between the action at
any two temperatures lying between the above degrees was so slight,
thatit did not   exceed the unavoidable        errors      of experiment.
   In  the next communication       we shall consider the relations          of the
interesting phenomena       of photo-chemical        induction.

    The President then addressed the Society            as follows :
     GENTLEMEN,                                                      ‘
 Since we last met to celebrate the Anniversary of this time-honoured
 Institution,  events   have taken place which it would be improper to
 pass over in silence.      I allude,   of course, to the occupation of Bur
 lington House, which we       owe to the      liberality and due appreciation
of Science of Her Majesty’s Government.                 Your Council have al
ready taken measures for the purpose of communicating to you the
most important information respecting our proposed migration, which
may be said to have already           commenced, though some time must
yet elapse before    it can be <U+FB01>nally completed.
    As soon as Her Majesty’ s Government had been apprised that this
Society had accepted their offer of apartments on the site in question,
in conjunction with the Linnean and Chemical Societies, directions
were given for commencing the necessary works, and                   I have the
grati<U+FB01>cation    of being able to announce to you, that considerable
progress has already been made: the eastern wing is ready for the
reception of the University, and the Great Hall is nearly completed.

                                         241
The main building will        be  shortly delivered over to our custody; and
 I entertain   con<U+FB01>dent hopes that the-removal          of the Society may take
 place early in the ensuing year, though the Great Hall in the west
wing may not be in        a <U+FB01>t state for painting.      This, however, will not
prevent its temporary occupation until such time as it may be neces
 sary to vacate   it for the purpose of its <U+FB01>nal completion.
    During the   recess and progress       of the works, suggestions of certain
alterations in the official plans have been made, some              of which have
been acceded to by the Government,               and  I  have every reason to
believe that no unnecessary delay will be allowed               to take place in
<U+FB01>nishing all that yet remains to be done.
    On such an important question           as an entire change     of abode, and
the abandonment of a locality occupied for so many years, and, as was
truly said by    a  distinguished Fellow of our Society, associated with
many hallowed names and reminiscences, it is impossible to expect
complete    unanimity of opinion,         and there may be some among us
who still doubt the propriety of the step which has been taken; but
they will,   I am   sure, give those who have approved             of the change
credit for having been actuated solely by a sincere wish to promote
the interests    of Science and of this Society.           I  still entertain the
sentiments on this subject which           I took  the liberty of expressing on
two occasions when       I addressed     you from this Chair     ; indeed  I am, if
possible, more than ever persuaded that great and lasting bene<U+FB01>t               will
accrue to Science from our removal to a site more accessible to the
great majority of our Members, and from the other advantages which
must follow in its train.       It has  been suggested,   that the two Societies
about to be associated with us, should for the future hold their meet
ings contemporaneously         with those of the Royal Society; so that on
those days on which the Linnean and Chemical Societies meet, their
Members may be enabled to join us in friendly converse after the
business   of the evening has been concluded.              I hope I am     not too
sanguine in anticipating great advantages from these assemblies                 of
earnest cultivators     of science, devoted followers of       one    of the most
deeply interesting and important of all human pursuits, in a building
not only adorned with the portraits         of some of the most distinguished
men who ever shed the lustre of their genius on the country which gave
them birth, but containing          on its walls, in convenient juxtaposition,
three   scienti<U+FB01>c   libraries,   the accumulated      treasures    of ages  of un

                                         242
   wearied research.     It cannot    be but that on such a spot, and        in such
   society, even the diligent cultivator of science will be stimulated             to
   greater exertions.
      Your Council have also adopted           a measure     which cannot fail     to
  be   productive    of bene<U+FB01>t to experimental philosophers.             It   is well
  known that on some occasions, when money has been voted by the
  Council, on the recommendation             of the Government Grant Com
  mittee, for the purpose     of aiding scienti<U+FB01>c researches,       a part  of such
  money has been expended on delicate apparatus,                necessary for the
  purpose    of performing     the requisite    experiments.       It is proposed
  that all such instruments shall become vested in this Society for the
lbene<U+FB01>t of the scienti<U+FB01>c public;         and the Council hope to be enabled
  to set apart a room for their safe custody, and perhaps for the per
  formance of experiments;          thus in some      measure reverting       to the
  practice   of ancient times    ;   with this   di<U+FB01>"erence,   that, whereas the
  apparatus of those days was necessarily primitive and rude, the                In
  strumental    Museum about to         be  constituted   will probably contain
  some   of the choicest specimens of the workmanship of our most
 accomplished      artisans.
     I  cannot take leave of this subject without tendering our sincere
 thanks to     Her Majesty’s Government for providing us with               so con
 venient and central an abode, a measure which will redound no less
 to the honour of those who conferred, than of those who received the
 valuable boon.
     I have before alluded to a Report of the Parliamentary            Committee
 of the British    Association,    addressed to that Association       at Glasgow
 in September 1855, in which were embodied opinions of certain emi
 nent cultivators of Science on the question,-—Whether any measures
 could be adopted by the Government or Parliament                 that would im
 prove the position     of Science or its cultivators in this country?
     The discussion of this important question by            a Committee     of the
British Association       at Glasgow,     was followed     by  a motion     in the
House     of Commons, during the           lat  Session, by    Mr. Heywood,       in
which he proposed that the question should be referred to a Com
mittee of the House of Commons.             The proposal was not entertained
by the House;       but in the discussion       which took place, Lord Pal
merston is understood to have expressed himself in terms from which
it might    be inferred that he would be       willing  to take into favourable

                                      243
consideration     any proposal    for the bene<U+FB01>t of Science that should
meet with the general approval         of its most trustworthy representa
tives; and the matter       was   deferred till the ensuing Session of Par
liament,   with the view partly, it is believed,            of permitting     the
question    to be meanwhile       maturely    considered by scienti<U+FB01>c      men.
Under such circumstances, your Council conceived that the period
was arrived in which the most ancient and venerable of all the
Societies   existing   in this country for the cultivation of Science was
 called upon to take some steps for the purpose of eliciting the
opinions of its most active Members on           a question   of such vital im
 portance as that above referred to, and which seemed likely again
to occupy the attention of the Legislature          at no distant period; and
accordingly,   on the 11th of    July   last, they resolved,—
    “ That it  was   expedient that the subject should receive the atten
 tion of the Council     at an early period    of the next Session, and that,
as a   preliminary    step, its consideration     should    be referred  to the
 Government     Grant Committee.”
    In pursuance of this resolution, the Government Grant Committee
met, and appointed a Sub-committee,            consisting    of seven Members
of their own Committee,        together with your of<U+FB01>cers, to prepare a
Report to them on the subject.            That Sub-committee met on the
 7th of October; and on this occasion they had before them the
replies to two Circulars, requesting opinions          on the above question,
the one dated the 16th of        July, and addressed by myself to the
Members of the Government Grant Committee; the other dated the
20th of August, and addressed to the Members of the General Com
mittee of the British Association         by the Secretary of that Associa
tion, in pursuance of a resolution       passed at Cheltenham on the 13th
of August last.
    The Sub-committee were therefore in            a very favourable    position
for considering    the various important matters involved in the ques
tion on which they          were    summoned       to   deliberate;   and   they
devoted two successive days to the consideration                of their Report
under circumstances       peculiarly  well adapted to elicit, by prolonged
 discussion, apart from the formality of ordinary meetings, the views
and sentiments of individual Members.
    In my former Address       I alluded to a proposal to constitute a new
 Board of Science, somewhat analogous in its functions to the late

                                                    244
 Board of Longitude, but extending its operations to the whole domain
 of Science. If this question he decided in the afiirmative, an ulterior
 one will arise, and that is,—Whether the Government                                   Grant Com
 mittee, either organized as at present, or under a new constitution,
 could perform those functions and act as such a Board?                                    The proper
 determination         of thisquestion involves many grave considerations, to
 some    of which      I   had the honour of directing                your attention in my
 former Address, ‘and on which                  I   need      not again enlarge.   It will be
 generally admitted, that the Committee has satisfactorily performed
 the limited duties now con<U+FB01>ded                         to    it,   of distributing the Parlia
 mentary Grant in aid of scienti<U+FB01>c researches.                               It    may be doubted,
 therefore, whether         it   would be prudent                   to interfere with their per
 formance of that task for the future; and                           it   may be advisable not to
 disturb in any way the present relations between this Society and
 the Government.   It    more di<U+FB01>icult point, however, to determine
                                 is   a
 whether     it   would be proper to invest your President and Council, or
 the Government   Grant Committee appointed by them, either with
 or without changes in its organization, with the functions which                                        it
 may be proposed to con<U+FB01>de to the Board above mentioned.                                       It       will
 be admitted,   that its constitution ought to be such as should inspire
 the cultivators of Science, and the public in general, with con<U+FB01>dence
in its administration.                It   ought also to be such as to ensure the
 con<U+FB01>dence of Government and Parliament,                              so that measures recom
 mended by        it   should meet with             a   favourable reception from them.
These questions will, doubtless, receive all that mature consideration
which their important                 bearing       on the interests of Science entitles
them to, and      I    trust that before our next Anniversary                        measures may
be adopted with the view                   of carrying out           some   of the recommenda
tions contained in the Report to which                       I      have already adverted.          ,
    On   a   former occasion        I      adverted to the necessity which existed for
conceding     a   certain amount of public support to educational establish
ments, for the use of those who have not the means or opportunity
of studying at the Universities, where the elements of physical science
might      be taught       on   a   general and systematic plan.                      If   this were
necessary at any former period,                 it   is      still more called for now, when
a   system of examinations, prior to the conferring                               of appointments,
seems to be gradually               taking     root and likely to form an important
-part   of our administrative organization.                         There   seems no reason     why

                                        245
the examination test should         be con<U+FB01>ned    to those who are candidates
for Government, or other public situations           ;  on the contrary,   it  seems
exceedingly desirable that a plan of admitting to the privileges of an
examination       all applicants, who desire to be examined, should be
adopted by the State.         The effect of such a measure upon education
generally, will undoubtedly be most bene<U+FB01>cial.             A  certi<U+FB01>cate might be
given to each person examined, of the extent of his acquirements.                  It
would then      be the part  of employers to ascertain whether the holders
of these certi<U+FB01>cates possessed in addition such quali<U+FB01>cations as would
 <U+FB01>t them for the situations at their disposal.             To such measures        as
 those above and before recommended,              together with the coopera
 tion of the Department of Science and Art, and the unremitting
 exertions of the Committee of Privy Council for education, presided
 over by its Vice-President,        or a Minister of Public Instruction, we
 must look for a gradual          development     of   a more general taste       for
 scienti<U+FB01>c studies, with its certain accompaniment, a proper apprecia
 tion   of scienti<U+FB01>c acquirements and researches.           Then, and then only,
 will Science      be generally    recognized    by a commercial       and manu
 facturing population,       who owe everything         to her applications,      not
            “ the very living principle and soul
 only    as                                             of the industrial arts,”
 but as one of the most truly noble of all intellectual pursuits.
     It  is not extraordinary    that those who are disposed to form a low
  estimate of the value of scienti<U+FB01>c          research, should      also entertain
  doubts as to the propriety of hazarding human life in its behalf.                In
  the late discussions on the expediency         of undertaking     another Polar
  Expedition, it seemed to be assumed by some, that the well-grounded
  anticipation of valuable contributions to physical and geographical
  science,   would not alone    be suf<U+FB01>cient    to justify the exposing of the
  lives   of gallant men to peril, not        even     of those who     were     most
  willing and anxious to      be so employed,     emulous of such distinction,
  and regardless     of the risk.    However    this may     be, it is certain that
  Science has sustained       and does still sustain injury from the fear of
  offending against this popular         notion,   that it is wrong      to hazard
  human life for such an object.         In  the case of the Polar Expedition,
   the  risk would    be very small, inasmuch        as the exploration,      instead
   of being as formerly a tentative one, embracing many thousand miles
   of unknown     coast, would be con<U+FB01>ned to a <U+FB01>xed and limited locality
   hitherto unexplored     and possessed of great scienti<U+FB01>c interest.           Inde
      voL.   vnr.                                                         x

pendently of additions to our geographical                    and physical knowledge,
the       possible    recovery      of the      magnetical       observations,     and    the
journals of the Franklin Expedition is                       a consideration       of great
moment,        since the former must have been made by o<U+FB02>icers well
trained to the task, with excellent instruments                       veri<U+FB01>ed before the
sailing of the Expedition, and in localities possessing peculiar interest
in reference to the theory                 of magnetism;          and the latter     would
doubtless contain a narrative of the deepest interest, not only to the
cultivators of science, but to the public generally, and especially the
relatives      of the gallant men who                  are supposed to have perished.
The Expedition           is,   however, also advocated on the score of humanity,
for experienced Arctic navigators                  still think   it   not impossible     that
some survivors          of the crews may          be    living among the    savage tribes,
whose lot      is    cast among those inhospitable           and barren regions.         But
admit that there          is    danger in these enterprises,—Is           it   inglorious to
perish in promoting              human     progress?        You will not suspect       me,I
am sure, of being indifferent               to the fate of brave men; but in fact
it   is   well nigh impossible to add to our stock of physical knowledge
without some risk to life.                  The Astronomer            in his observatory,
exposed night after night to the open air at                  a   freezing temperature;
the Chemist in his laboratory,                 among explosive and poisonous sub
stances;       the Surgeon who handles the dissecting knife,——al1 equally
with the adventurous traveller               expose their lives to      peril.    We know
what was the opinion of the great Athenian moralist and martyr on
this question, from that <U+FB01>ne               passage     in which the dangers of military
and civil life are so beautifully contrasted                  :—“ I     should have acted
strangely       indeed,”        says be,   “if,    having    stood <U+FB01>rmly in the post
assigned to me by my general at Amphipolis, Potidaea and Delium,
and braved every danger,              I     had turned coward and feared to die,
when my God ordered me to be                a   philosopher      and instruct mankind.”
Whether men perish in                 peace       or war,   if   they fall in advancing
civilization     or arresting        the progress of barbarism,           what matters       it
whether their bones rest in                a   soldier’s grave, or lie scattered,         “as
when one heweth wood,” on the ice-bound shores of the Polar Sea?
All are entitled to the Spartan epitaph, “ Go tell our countrymen we
lie here, having obeyed their commands,”-for                              all have       alike
ful<U+FB01>lled their mission.

adventurous navigator addressing his crew, about to leave the narrow
seas and launch        out on a great and unexplored             ocean,     in these
animating lines    :—
                        “ Fatti non foste a viver come bruti,
                          Ma per seguir virtute e conoscenza."
    The interesting expedition to the Peak of Teneri<U+FB02>'e,                 to  which I_
called your attention on a previous           occasion, has now been brought
to a conclusion,      and we may congratulate          Admiral Smyth on the
return of his enterprising         son in safety, after having performed im
portant services to astronomical          and physical science.        Great credit
is due to    Mr. Piazzi Smyth for the perseverance and skill with
which he surmounted           di<U+FB02>iculties.     The allusion to this Expedition
imposes on me the pleasing duty of commemorating the liberality of
Mr. R. Stephenson, M.P., in placing his yacht and her crew at the
unreserved disposal of Mr. Piazzi Smyth for some months; a pro
ceeding    which    deserves     the grateful    acknowledgments         of all true
lovers of science.
    I understand     that the value of the meteorological              observations
made by     Mr. Smyth has        been much      enhanced by the excellence         of
the instruments supplied          to the Expedition by the Board of Trade,
 after having   been     tested at that valuable establishment,             the Kew
 Qbservatory.
    Having had occasion to allude to this Observatory,              I  am sure you
 will be glad to hear that your Council have lately had            an   opportunity
 of proving, that their desire to uphold useful scienti<U+FB01>c undertakings
 is not exhibited alone in the support of establishments organized by
 themselves, and yielding          fruits of which they reap the fame, but
 that  they   are   willing to extend         a  helping hand wherever           real
 Science has taken root, and has need of a friend.                 It  had become
necessary to light the Kew Observatory              with  gas,  in order to pro
secute conveniently        and successfully the important         processes there
carried on of testing meteorological instruments for the Government
and foreign nations, and the photographic              registration     of physical
phenomena.        An application       was made to Government         to defray the
cost, estimated    at  £250.        A long   correspondence    ensued,       which is
no   bad illustration of the defects of the existing relations between
Science and the Executive authorities of the State.               The application
was declined.       Immediately upon receiving notice of this disappoint
                                                                    x 2

                                        248
ment, your Council voted            £250 from the Wollaston Fund to the
British Association       to be employed        in lighting their Observatory,
and the works are now in progress.
    The Astronomers continue to add yearly to the catalogue of the
planetary bodies      of our solar system, several small planets revolving
between Mars and Jupiter.            The rapid progress of these discoveries
is well illustrated     by mentioning, that in 1852 no less than eight
were discovered, in 1854 six, and in the present year <U+FB01>ve have been
already added to the list       ; again commencing with 1847, every year
has been signalized by the <U+FB01>nding of some of these planetoids.                They
now amount in number to forty-two;                and astronomers      have found
it necessary to assign, by agreement among themselves, the labour
of observing a certain portion of them to particular observatories,
each astronomer taking charge of, and making himself accountable
for,  accurate observations        of  some    <U+FB01>ve to eight members of this
curious group.        Thus has     a division    of labour in astronomical re
search been fairly organized;         and   I cannot but think that the prin
ciple might be carried very much further with great advantage to
the progress of knowledge.           To take an illustration from astronomy
only, on casting your eyes        over the list of Observatories, both public
and private, in the Nautical Almanac, you would be surprised at their
number; now that list contains only a portion of the private obser
vatories of this country, and such establishments are very numerous
in the United States also.          Now let us re<U+FB02>ect for        a moment     what
 would   be the effect    if to each of these      numerous observers, who is
quali<U+FB01>ed    for the task and possesses the necessary means, were to be
allotted some one peculiar         object of astronomical      research, and this
were pursued      till the special purpose in view should       be  fully attained.
The amount of work performed would surely be augmented to a
great extent.       The same principle is applicable, though perhaps
in a less   degree,   to other departments        of science.     But  I  entertain
little hope of any such scheme            as that,   which has     been   sketched
 out, being carried to a prosperous issue,           till another revolution has
taken    place   in Science, which        I   cannot but look forward         to as
eminently calculated to advance its progress           ; I mean  a greater amount
 of intercourse between the members of the various Scienti<U+FB01>c Societies
 of Europe and America.
    The bene<U+FB01>ts which such          a  measure would confer are numerous,

                                         249
 but time will not permit          me  to do more than hint at some few of
 them.
    In the <U+FB01>rst place,   then, the requirements of Science often necessitate
 large outlays of money on objects, the importance of which, in the
 present state of knowledge, can hardly be su<U+FB02>iciently appreciated by
 a majority of the members of any community.              A  Government, how~
 ever enlightened     itself, however much alive to the value of the mea»
 sure suggested, may hesitate in such a case to take upon itself
 the responsibility    of recommending        that the whole cost should        be
 borne by the particular nation whose welfare is committed                 to its
 care; this might     be a step too much      in advance of public intelligence
 and therefore likely to be condemned.            Now there would    seem to be
 no reason why,      in such an instance         as this, the various  civilized
 nations should not agree to bear the cost between them; and                I am
 persuaded,    that  if  greater intercommunication        took place between
 foreign cultivators of science and ourselves, this is a result at which
 we   should at last arrive.       A  better illustration cannot be given       of
 the kind of scienti<U+FB01>c undertaking,        which might    be thus parcelled out
 among various countries, than the scheme which has been for some
 time under discussion for establishing          a re<U+FB02>ecting  telescope of con
 siderable power in some convenient locality in the Southern Hemi
 sphere, for the purpose of observing the Southern Nebulae.                  It  is
not di<U+FB01>icult to demonstrate the importance of this object.            The great
command of light possessed           by the magni<U+FB01>cent telescope of our late
 distinguished   President,    Lord Rosse, has enabled him to detect cer
tain con<U+FB01>gurations      in the Nebulae visible in this country, which had
escaped   the notice of prior observers; I allude to the discovery of the
spiral form of several of these curious objects.            Now this is   a fact
of peculiar interest, as bearing upon important questions of physical
astronomy, the question,        e. g. whether certain laws prevailing in our
own system, and even        in many stellar groups comparatively near to
us,   extend to the very remote regions of space tenanted by the
Nebulae.     Many   ages may indeed elapse         before these questions can
be solved,   but it is    a  duty   we owe    to posterity to supply the data
required for solving them        ;  and it is necessary for that purpose that
accurate drawings should          be now made     of the present appearances
of these objects, to be     compared with the observations of after times.
Lord Rosse is at present engaged in making detailed observations

                                       250
and drawings      of the appearances presented by Nebulae visible in
our own latitudes ; and it is most desirable that a telescope, not much,
if any,  inferior in power to his, should        be set up somewhere        in the
Southern     Hemisphere     to perform    for the Nebulae there visible the
like o<U+FB02>ice.     Now the cost of such an instrument will             be very con
siderable, and the expense will not be con<U+FB01>ned to its construction
merely,    but  a large    permanent     outlay    will  be  necessary for the
maintenance     of observers, and occasional repolishing of the specula,
repairs, and so forth.       Here is an object in which all mankind              are
interested, but of which the importance is not likely to be so well
appreciated by the majority        of even educated men,       as to make them
very willing to spend large sums upon carrying it out;             it is therefore
one to which the funds        of several communities might usefully con
tribute a small share.       Happily there    are precedents for the adoption
of such   a course,   for our Government has in           one instance at least
within my knowledge,         and perhaps in others, liberally aided with
its resources the labours        of foreign men of science.         Surely   it is a
pleasing spectacle to view several nations combining             their resources
to advance highly intellectual       inquiries, in the success of which the
whole world is concerned      ;  and though it may not at <U+FB01>rst sight appear
that any utilitarian end is likely to be promoted              by the discovery
of laws which prevail in regions so far removed from ourselves, still
the whole history of Science shows, that useful applications are con
tinually arising in quarters where they         are most unexpected;       and he
who is thus deterred from prosecuting             scienti<U+FB01>c discovery,     in any
quarter    whatever,     has   watched     the    progress   of the      inductive
sciences   and the gradual      growth of art to very little purpose.            No
knowledge     of the laws of the grander phenomena of nature can pos
sibly be a matter    of indifference to us, when every day’s experience
more and more establishes the fact          of the  close analogies    which sub
sist between all her operations.          Who can say, therefore, that the
lapse of ages   will not reveal the e<U+FB01>fects of laws in operation in these
mighty systems (where       we are enabled, as     it  were, to take a compre
hensive survey     of the <U+FB01>eld of action), the observation of which may
throw important light upon obscure phenomena, the mysteries of
which have hitherto baf<U+FB01>ed the researches of our most acute philo
sophers’! and once admit that these revelations may be made, and it
may be safely predicated        that a long succession of applications            to

                                           251
  purposes of utility of the utmost importance                to the well-being       of
  the human       race may follow in their train.           It   must be admitted
  that a great demand is made upon. our forbearance by those who
  would     depreciate    scienti<U+FB01>c    researches by the constant            repetition
  of this   senseless   cry of  “Cui bono.”        Well might one of our most
  distinguished      philosophers,     the worthy son of a renowned father,
  a<U+FB01>irm, that he could not listen to          it without   a sense    of humiliation.
  It  is indeed incredible that so many men should be found to indulge
  in it in the present age, after the many astounding               proofs which the
  history    of the progress of knowledge affords, that had such sentiments
  prevailed in bygone times, human progress would have been almost
  arrested, and a very large proportion           of the comforts and luxuries
   which we now enjoy would have been lost to mankind.
      I  have thus instanced one useful end which may be attained by
   a more      extended intercourse        between     scienti<U+FB01>c    men in different
   countries;     I will now mention another.           In the progress of the late
  investigations     into the means of improving the relations between Sci
   ence and the Government,         it has occurred to     me that    if  some confer
   ence  could take place between representatives of the leading Scienti<U+FB01>c
   Societies of Europe and America, important information might be
   collected as to the general bearings of this question, by comparing
   the mode of dealing with       it in different countries possessing admini
   strative    systems variously      organized.       There    are  many      questions
   again of great importance to the progress of Science,              as e. g. a  liberal
   extension     of our system of book-postage,            which might         be  much
   advanced by prevailing on in<U+FB02>uential           societies in di<U+FB01>'erent countries
   to urge their favourable consideration on their respective Governments                ;
   and   it is really necessary that our energies should be directed to pro
   moting the general diffusion of the scienti<U+FB01>c publications of all coun
  -tries by every means in our power, in order that the evil may be arrested
   from which Science has already suffered so much; I mean the devotion
   of time and of talents of the most transcendent order in one country to
-  the performancepof tasks which have already been satisfactorily com
   pleted in another.        I cannot but think, therefore, that periodical
   meetings of deputies from the principal Scienti<U+FB01>c                Societies at some
   central spot on the continent of Europe would have                    a tendency to
   promote      these and many other useful objects, which,               if I  were not
   afraid of trespassing on your patience,           I  might perhaps point out;

                                             252
and a small portion  of the funds of every Society would be well
employed in defraying the cost.  I will say nothing of the collateral
advantages which would flow from such reunions, in making scienti<U+FB01>c
men of different nations known to one another; but of this be well
assured, that nothing, however seemingly trivial, which promotes good
fellowship between neighbouring               statcs,——nothing,      however transitory
in its duration,      which brings men of different nations together in
friendly and social converse on subjects of a neutral character, and
altogether alien from topics which powerfully excite human passions,
can fail to exercise a most salutary in<U+FB02>uence in preserving peaceful
relations and promoting               the prosperity of the whole human race.
  The time has now arrived when many considerations might induce
me to resign the trust you have done me the honour to con<U+FB01>de to
me into your hands, but many important                    matters which have been
undertaken since this distinguished                of<U+FB01>ce was conferred 'on me still
remain unsettled; and in particular the decision of that interesting
question, to which     I have directed your attention,—I              mean the relations
which ought to subsist between Government and Science,—still hangs
on the balance.   As it was principally with a view of assisting in
improving,      if   possible,        those relations   that   I   consented to accept
an honour to which          I    felt myself unequal, so       I   hope to be enabled to
prove, before    I resign       it,   that on one important subject at least      I   have
not laboured in vain.
     The Copley Medal has been awarded to Professor Henry Milne
Edwards,     who ranks by common consent as the most eminent living
representative of the French School of Natural-History;                     being distin
guished alike for his extensive knowledge                  of Comparative Anatomy
and Physiology, as well as of Zoology, and for the amount and value
of his original contributions               to these sciences.        His whole career
evinces the truly philosophic spirit in which he has laboured;                         and
itwould be difficult to name any existing Naturalist who has prose
cuted his researches with equal success over so very wide  range of           a
investigation.
  Although Professor Milne-Edwards has furnished many valuable
additions to our knowledge of the Vertebrated classes, yet has                    it
been to the Invertebrata                that his chief attention       has been given;

lusca, and Radiata—his       researches have been so important and suc
cessful, that what he has accomplished for either alone would su<U+FB02>ice
to establish   for him  a high scienti<U+FB01>c reputation.
    His earliest labours were chie<U+FB02>y directed to the class Crustacea;
of which (after having published numerous Memoirs on its various
subdivisions) he produced in 1837-1840 an elaborate Monograph,
Anatomical,     Physiological, and Systematic,—which is universally re
 garded as of pre-eminent      merit, not only for its richness   of detail,
 but also for the value of the general doctrines relating      to Homolo
 gies, Development,     Geographical    Distribution, and other points of
 the highest physiological    interest, which are enunciated in its pages.
     The A’/melida have also occupied much of Professor Milne-Ed
 wards’s attention; his researches on their structure, and especially
 on   their development, were among the <U+FB01>rst, and are still among the
 most important of those numerous contributions which have of late
 added so much to our knowledge of this class;        and they have served
  as models    for all who have followed in the     same  path of inquiry.
  Some   of the most important of these researches      were  made on the
  coast of Sicily, whither Professor     Milne-Edwards was sent by the
  French Government       in charge of an Expedition for the study of
  Marine Zoology.
     His researches on the Circulation of the Mollusca, undertaken to
  clear up the di<U+FB02>iculties in the asserted plzlebenterism of the Nudi
  branchiata, have introduced a new and satisfactory mode of regard
  ing the circulation of the Invertebrata generally, which throws light
  upon many obscurities,      and solves many perplexitie.       Again, his
  researches on the Compound Ascidians have led to an entirely fresh
  appreciation   of  some  of the most important points in the history of
  that group, which had escaped the penetration of Savigny ;-—more
  especially by making it clear that propagation by gemmatian, which
  had been previously supposed to be a Zoophytic character, is equally
  true of the lower Mollusca; thus was the way prepared for the re
  ception of the Bryozoa into that sub-kingdom.
      The labours of Professor Milne-Edwards upon Zoophytes have
  not been less important or less successful than in the departments
  already named.       He was (with his collaborateur     M. Audouin) the
  <U+FB01>rst to observe and to appreciate the essential distinctions between
  the so-called Polypes of the Flustra and its allies, and the true
                                                              ,¢

Zoophytes; he has done more than any other Naturalist to deter-'
mine the boundaries of the group of Polyzoa (Bryozoa), under which
these organisms—detached          by common consent from the true Zoo
phytes—are now ranked          ; and by showing their very close relation
ship to the Compound         Ascidians,    he has established     their title to
rank in the Molluscous series.
    The True Zoophytes        have also received much        of his attention;
and his Monographs of various recent types            of these, with his great
work on the Fossil Corals of Great Britain,-—executed            by him (with
the assistance     of his friend and pupil, M.       Jules Haime *) for the
Palseontographical     Society,—-testify     to the ability and success with
which he has studied them.
    Even in this imperfect sketch, it would be wrong to pass by Pro
fessor Milne-Edwards’s admirable Memoirs on various members of
the class Acalephw,       which    are   unsurpassed    for their accuracy of
anatomical detail and their justness        of physiological deduction.
    Whilst pursuing these laborious trains of original research, Pro
fessor Milne-Edwards has also been extensively engaged in the ho
nourable work of Public Instruction;            and both by his lectures and
his writings he has applied himself to the di<U+FB02>"usion of a sound taste
for science through the community.              And in whatever path he has
followed, he has been distinguished          by the  same single-minded      love
of truth, and disregard of all sel<U+FB01>sh and personal considerations,             as
have pre-eminently      characterized his scienti<U+FB01>c labours.
        Paorasson MILNE-EDWARDS,              .
    Accept this Medal, the highest reward in our power to bestow, in
token of our just appreciation of the labours of a life devoted to
 Natural Science, and distinguished by original views.
    The Rumford Medal has been awarded to M. Pasteur for his dis
 covery   of the nature of racemic acid, and its relations to polarized
 light.
    Chemists had long been acquainted with a peculiar acid, racemic,
 or paratartaric acid, which had the same composition as tartaric acid,
    * M. Haime‘s recent death will be deeply lamented by all who were acquainted
 with the high promise of future distinction which he had already given.

                                                   255
    and the same saturating power, and resembled                           it in   its. properties    in
    a very remarkable           manner.         Yet the two acids were not identical,
    and the cause of their difference, notwithstanding                          their   close agree
    ment, remained a mystery.                  The resemblance between the two acids
    had been rendered still more striking on                       a comparison         of the phy
    sical characters of their salts; for their crystalline forms were the
    same, their speci<U+FB01>c gravities the same, their double refraction the
    same. Yet the solutions of the tartrates rotated the plane of polari
    zation of polarized light, while those of the racemates were inactive.
          In   a careful scrutiny           of the crystalline          forms    of the tartrates,
    M. Pasteur was led to recognize the almost universal presence of
    hemihedral       faces,   of such       a character that the two hemihedral                forms
    which together make up the holohedral, were “dissymmetric,” that
'
    is,
      could not be superposed on each other, but each could be super
    posed on the image of the other in                    a   mirror.      Sometimes the hemi
    hedrism was indicated              merely by the greater development of one
    pair of     faces than    of another pair.            A    hemihedrism         of such.   a   cha
    racter that the two hemihedral                    forms were distinguished             by right
    handedness and left-handedness, seemed                        to be associated with the
    rotatory power of the solutions of the tartrates. If so, the crystals
    of the racemates might be expected not to exhibit the character of
    right- or left-handedness, since their solutions were known to                            be     in
    active on polarized            light.     Accordingly, on forming                several of the
    racemates, and carefully                examining     the crystals,         M. Pasteur found
    that the hemihedrism which had                     been observed        in the tartrates       was
    wanting in the racemates.
          These patient       and laborious        researches in pursuit of truth were
    presently rewarded with an unexpected and brilliant discovery.                                   On
    examining        the crystals      obtained in an attempt to form the double
    racemate of soda and ammonia,                 M. Pasteur observed that the crystals
    were hemihedral,          and of two kinds,           which differed only as to right
    handedness and left-handedness                ;   the one kind, which for distinction’s
    sake       may   be    called    right-handed,            absolutely     agreeing with           the
    corresponding          double     tartrate,       the other with the image of the
    tartrate in      a    On separating the crystals of the two kinds
                         mirror.
    mechanically, and dissolving them apart, the solution of the right
    handed crystals was found to rotate the plane of polarization of
    polarized light right-handedly,               like‘   a   solution of the tartrate, that of

                                       256
the left-handed      crystals left-handedly.       These solutions yielded on
evaporation,      the one only right-handed,        the other only left-handed
crystals.    The crystals of the two salts were puri<U+FB01>ed by recrystallizw
tion, their acids isolated, and the chemical, optical, crystallographic,
and pyroelectric      properties   of the acids themselves or their salts or
solutions    carefully compared.        A like     comparison       was instituted
between these acids and the well-known tartaric                   acid.     The acid
obtained    from     the right-handed crystals           proved   to be absolutely
identical with tartaric     acid in all its properties, that obtained from
the left-handed      crystals proved to be identical,        so to speak,      with the
image of tartaric acid in a mirror, the two acids absolutely agreeing
in all their properties except as to right-handedness and left-handed
ness. Where the one acid yielded crystals hemihedral right-handedly,
the other yielded       crystals   exactly    similar,    except that     they were’
hemihedral left-handedly; where the one yielded a solution rotating
the plane   of polarization right-handedly, the other yielded              a   solution
rotating it left-handedly to the very         same amount, and       with the very
same peculiar dispersion      of the colours.      On mixing equal quantities
of the acids from the right-handed and left-handed crystals, racemic
acid was reproduced.
     Stimulated by this remarkable discovery,            M. Pasteur has continued
his labours in the same direction, and the results which he has since
obtained are given in a series        of papers published in the ‘Annales
de   Chimie,’ and extending nearly to the present time.
     Hitherto no “active” substance     e. one whose solution has the
                                             (i.
power of rotating the plane         of polarization       of polarized light) has
been obtained arti<U+FB01>cially from inactive substances, except                in   the case
of the splitting up, or at least separation, of racemic acid into              a   right
handed and    a   left-handed substance   ;                of the
                                              and this law seems worthy
attention of chemists who attempt the arti<U+FB01>cial formation of the
organic alkaloids.      This law would have been violated had two acids
which chemists had obtained from fumaric acid, an inactive substance,
and which appeared to be identical with aspartic and malic acids
respectively, been really so.       But M. Pasteur found that these acids
were inactive, unlike aspartic and malic acids, from which they also
ditfered in some other respects.
     The two acids obtained from racemic acid were found to be iden
tical in their properties      (except as to right-handedness              and left

                                     257
handedness) so long as they were mixed or combined with inactive
substances only, but M. Pasteur found that this is no longer the case
when they are combined with active substances, as for example the
organic    alkaloids,  in which  case the salts obtained differ widely   in
solubility, crystalline form, &c.
    It is to the stimulus afforded by the investigations    of M. Pasteur
that we must ascribe the more recent discovery by M. Marbach,
that several crystals     belonging   to the cubical   system possess   the
power     of rotating the plane of polarization.       Thus M. Pasteur’s
original discovery has already begun to bear fruit in discoveries made
by others.
       DR. Snanrnv, in the      absence  of the Foreign Secretary,
    I request that you will transmit this Medal to M. Pasteur, in
testimony of the value which we attach to his brilliant discovery.
    Your Council have awarded one of the Royal Medals to Sir John
 Richardson. His claims to that honour as a most distinguished
 naturalist and scienti<U+FB01>c traveller, will I am sure be generally admitted.
 Sir  J. Richardson’s earliest work on   Zoology appeared about the year
 1823, but his <U+FB01>rst great work was published          in 1829, namely the
 ‘Fauna     Boreali-Americana,’    in which he has described the Qua
 drupeds and Fishes of the Arctic Regions, and with Mr. Swainson’s
 aid, the Birds; the merits of this work, in the very accurate descrip
 tions   of the  species, in the great amount of information on their
 habits and ranges, are admitted to be of the highest order.          Since
 that period Sir J. Richardson has published largely on various
 branches    of zoology, physical geography, and meteorology.      His Re
 ports to the British Association, on the Fishes of New Zealand and of
 China,   are extremely interesting under many points    of view. Another
 Report to the     same body on the General Zoology     of North America,
 is a most valuable contribution     to science.   His later works, which
 here    must   be   more particularly considered, are the ‘ Zoology of
 the Voyages      of the Terror and of the Herald,’ in which he has
 described the Fishes and Reptiles collected during those expeditions,
 and given an account      of some  of the great extinct mammifers of the
 Arctic countries, with very interesting observations on their ancient
 relations and ranges.       He has also lately contributed to the Geolo

                                      258
gical Journal a valuable paper, in which he has made known                   the
presence of tertiary      strata abounding     with vegetable remains, in
districts  now rendered sterile by the extreme cold.              Altogether    I
think there can    be no doubt that the merits       of Sir John Richardson,
as a philosophical    naturalist,  are  of a very  high order.
   It is  not within our province to reward his other claims to distinc
tion; but all will rejoice, that in the conscientious discharge of              a
delicate and important duty, the Council have been able to bestow               a
Medal on     one, who has earned the applause        of all who have watched
his career, for his patient endurance and fortitude           under incredible
hardships in his <U+FB01>rst Arctic Expedition in company with Franklin,‘
and again for his chivalrous      self-devotion    in the   cause  of friendship
and science combined, at a period of life when most men resolve to
rest from their labours, or at least would hesitate to encounter the
fatigues and dangers of a Polar Expedition, the anticipation            of which
must have been more appalling to one, who had bitter experience of
their painful reality.
      Sm    J. Rronannson,
   Accept this Medal       as a token    of our respect for your scienti<U+FB01>c
labours and character.
   The other Royal Medal has been awarded to Professor Thomson,
whose labours in the cause of science are well known to scienti<U+FB01>c
men.      Yet the brief reference which can now       be made to the    Memoirs
which he has written, will convey but an imperfect notion of the
services which he has rendered ; for the zeal with which he is inspired,
his clear apprehension of mathematical and physical truths, and the
freedom with which he communicates his ideas, have powerfully con
tributed to stimulate others in the pursuit of truth, and direct them
into right paths. Shortly after graduating in the University of Cam
bridge he undertook      the task of editing the Cambridge Mathematical
Journal, which under his auspices          was  placed on an enlarged basis,
                         ‘
under the title of the     Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical            Journal,’
and is well known to the mathematicians           of Europe.      This Journal,
                                      ‘
as   well as its predecessor the        Cambridge Mathematical          Journal,’
is enriched    by numerous contributions        from    the pen of Professor
Thomson on various subjects, especially the mathematical theories

                                        259
of heat, electricity,     and magnetism.        Among     these    may be men
tioned    a masterly     article  in which he has shown            the   compati
bility of the ordinary mathematical theory of statical electricity
with various phenomena which had been supposed by some
to   militate    against   it;   his   deduction  from     mathematical         prin
ciples of Faraday’s      law relating to the motion of a small paramag
netic or diamagnetic        body in a magnetic <U+FB01>eld;           and his method
of   electrical   images,    <U+FB01>rst    communicated     to    the   public    at    the
meeting of the British Association         at  Oxford in 1847, by which he
is enabled in an extremely simple and elegant manner to solve a
variety of important problems relating to the distribution              of electri
city on conductors.
   Called to the Chair of Natural Philosophy in the University of
Glasgow in the year 1846, he has ever since continued to devote
himself to    science in the intervals of his necessary occupations, and
has worked especially at his favourite subjects of heat and electricity.
    Carnot long since developed the mathematical theory of the motive
power of heat in a clear and satisfactory manner, assuming                     as_  an
axiom the indestructibility of heat.          But the important        researches
of Mr. Joule have shown that this axiom must                 be abandoned,         for
that heat and work       are mutually    convertible.    The establishment of
this point necessitated a reconstruction of the mathematical theory
of the motive power of heat, a theory of much practical importance
from its direct bearing on the steam-engine, and this task Professor
Thomson accomplished in a series of papers published in the ‘Edin
burgh Transactions.’
    Professor Thomson and Mr. Joule have for                  a long   time been
working together, and they           are now engaged     in   a series  of experi
mental researches on the thermal effects of <U+FB02>uids in motion.                     The
expenses attending the prosecution-of these             researches     have been
defrayed by donations from the Government Grant, and the results
already obtained, drawn up partly in the form of short provisional
accounts, have appeared in the ‘ Philosophical Transactions               ’
                                                                            and in
the
      ‘
        Proceedings   of the Royal Society.’
    In   connexion    with this subject       may be      mentioned      Professor
Thomson’s remarkable speculation as to the cause of the light and
heat of the sun, which he refers to the impact of meteoric bodies
circulating around that luminary and continually                falling in.   .  The

                                        260
opinion of scienti<U+FB01>c men seems to be divided as to the reception of
 this theory; but whatever may be thought of its truth, it has at least
 the merit   of referring the light and heat to known causes.
    The mathematical theory of magnetism was developed by the illus
 trious Poisson, but     was made to rest on foundations       in some respects
 too    speculative.   This subject has       been   taken    up by Professor
 Thomson, who in        a  lucid and satisfactory manner has placed the
 theory on the basis      of observed facts,  so as to render    it independent
 of any ulterior suppositions which may be adopted respecting the
 nature of magnetism.         Two papers on this subject are published in
      ‘
 the    Philosophical Transactions,’     and others, containing the theory of
 magnetic induction, are promised.          More recently Professor Thomson
 has published a series      of papers devoted to the mathematical theory
 of the submarine telegraph, and has been engaged in a series of
 experimental researches relating to voltaic        electricity,  which formed
the subject of the Bakerian Lecture delivered in the session just con
 cluding,   and of which the detailed account will shortly be in the
 hands of the Fellows       of the Society.
        PROFESSOR     Tnomsom,
    Accept this Medal in testimony of our admiration               of your able
mathematical and physical researches.
                   Obituary Notices      of deceased Fellows.
    JAO.UEs    CHARLES Fnarzcois STURM was born at Geneva in
September 1803, of a family which had quitted Strasbourg in the
middle of the last century, where one of his ancestors had been
President     of the Republic at the period of its contests with the
Emperor Charles V., and another had attained a distinguished re
putation for his writings on jurisprudence and theology.                   After
completing his school education and his classical studies at the
College with remarkable         success,  he became in his <U+FB01>fteenth year a
student    of the University of his native city, where his rapid progress
in the study of mathematics and philosophy attracted the marked
attention    of the well-known geometer Simon Lhuillier, who fully
anticipated the eminence which he was afterwards destined to attain.

                                          261
      The sudden death of his father, leaving his mother and four
   children, of whom Charles was the eldest, without any adequate main
   tenance, compelled     him, before the      close  of his seventeenth year,
   to resort to private tuition for the support of himself and his family;
   and three years afterwards he was recommended to the Due de
   Broglie,   as tutor to the brother of Madame         de  Broglie, the son  of
   Madame de Stael.       At the  close of the year 1823, he accompanied his
   pupil to Paris, and though he shortly afterwards returned to Geneva,
   he found no suf<U+FB01>cient occupation there, and he <U+FB01>nally resolved, in
   company with his intimate         friend and school-fellow,    M. Colladon,
~ the present distinguished      Professor of Physics at Geneva, to seek his
  fortune in the great city, which was then, and had long been, the
  undisputed     metropolis of European science.        Sturm had already    be
  come very favourably known to mathematicians by several articles in
         ‘
  the      Annales   de  Mathématiques’ of M. Gergonne, on different
  branches of analysis and geometry, and the strong recommendations
  which he and his companion bore with them from Lhuillier, and the
  kind of<U+FB01>ces of M. Gerono, made them known to Ampere, Fourier,
  Arago,     and other eminent members of the Institute, who recom
  mended them to pupils         as a means    of support.    Sturm afterwards
  obtained employment upon the ‘Bulletin Universel,’ under Baron
  Férussac, and was, in fact, a subordinate in the o<U+FB02>ice of that journal
  when he published       his well-known Theorem.           He and his friend
  speedily began ‘to feel the in<U+FB02>uence of breathing in an atmosphere of
  science, and their joint labours were rewarded by a distinction        of no
  ordinary importance, when the Academy of Sciences awarded to them
  the great prize    of mathematics propoed for the best Essay on the
  Compression     of Liquids.
     The determination       of the number of real roots of        a numerical
  equation    which   are  included     between   given limits,  is a problem
  which had occupied the attention of the greatest analysts of the past
 age, of Waring, of La Grange, and more especially of Fourier, who
 of all other analysts had made the nearest approaches to its practical,
 though he had failed in its theoretical, solution: the attention of
 Sturm had been for some time directed to this class of researches,
 which he pursued with remarkable continuity and diligence, encou
 raged, as he himself assures us, by the instructions       and advice of this
 eminent master.       The result   was
                                          the discovery of the theorem which
     VOL.   VIII.                                                 Y

                                        262
will be for    ever   associated with his name, and which              conquered
the di<U+FB01>iculty which had embarrassed all his predecessors, and thus
permanently     extended the dominion           of analysis; a rare good for
tune, which though         frequently   denied to the most illustrious cul
tivators  of the   sciences,    is always reerved to those only who are
enabled, by the extent and accuracy              of their knowledge and the
clearness of their views, to follow out the glimmerings           of light which
escape the observation       of ordinary   eyes.
   The memoir which contained this important theorem was pre
sented to the Academy on the 25th of May, 1829, and rapidly con
ducted its author to fortune and public honours.                 The connexion
of its author with the ‘Bulletin Universel’ enabled him to give an
immediate account of his method to the world; the paper itself
was not published      till  some years afterwards,      in the “Mémoires      des
Savans Etrangers.”
   In  the course     of  a few years he was chosen           a member     of the
principal scienti<U+FB01>c societies of Europe: the Copley Medal               was given
to him by this Society: he was elected a member                of the Academy,
as the successor    of Ampere, in 1836        : in the same year he was made
Professor of Mathematics,         upon the special recommendation       of Arago,
at the College      Rollin,    Répétiteur    at the Ecole      Polytechnique    in
 1838, and in 1840 he was deemed worthy to succeed to the chair                 of
Mechanics    at the same school, which had been so long honoured                by
the occupation of Poisson,          the most illustrious of the successors      of
La Place.     It  was not without some          difficulty that the substantial
rewards    of his scienti<U+FB01>c        achievement     were   obtained:    he was     a
foreigner,  and naturally placed at a disadvantage in a contest              with
native competitors.      It  is right to notice this, both for the honour        of
France and as a proof of the very high reputation which Sturm had
attained.
   The subsequent memoirs of Sturm, whether <U+FB01>rst presented to the
Academy or not, were chie<U+FB02>y printed in the Journal of M. Liouville,
an analyst  of congenial tastes and pursuits with his own, with whom
he lived on terms of the most affectionate friendship.              Two of these
memoirs, relating to the discussion of differential and partial differ
ential equations, such as present           themselves so commonly         in the
solution of the more important           problems of mathematical        physics,
possessed  a merit so extraordinary,       that   M. Liouville—-a most compe

                                       263
  tent judge, dcclared—-at a time when he was himself a competitor with
  Sturm for   a place  in the Academy,--“ that impartial posterity would
 -‘place them by the side of the <U+FB01>nest memoirs of La Grange.” The <U+FB01>rst
  of these two memoirs was presented in 1833 to the concours for the
  great prize of Mathematics,     to be awarded by the Academy in 1834
  for the most important discovery in that science made known within
 the preceding     three years.     The Academy conferred the prize on
  Sturm-—not for the memoir which he had submitted to the judgment
 of the Commission,        but for that which contained his celebrated
 theorem and which had been presented in 1829.              Other memoirs
 relate to optics, mechanics, pure analysis, and analytical       geometry,
 and embrace the most dif<U+FB01>cult questions which have been treated in
 those several branches     of science.   One of the latest of these was
 a communication       to the Academy on the theory of vision, and is
 remarkable     both  for the geometrical and analytical     elegance   with
 which many questions subsidiary to the theory are treated in it.          It
 con<U+FB01>rms     generally,—with    one   important   exception relating to the
 asserted muscularity     of the crystalline lens and the changes attri-C
 buted to its action,—-the views of the late Dr. Thomas Young in his
 well-known memoir on this subject.
     Sturm visited England in 1841, and      gave the mathematicians   with
 whom he conversed a high impression, as well of the extent of his
 knowledge as of his inventive power.
     The health of M. Sturm, which had previously been remarkably
vigorous, began to decline in 1851, probably in consequence of his
laborious    public employments and the unremitting          everity of his
studies: he died on the 18th of December last, to the      deep regret  of  a
large circle of friends and pupils, to whom he appears to have been
singularly endeared by the modesty, truthfulness, and simplicity of
his character.      “To my eyes,” said M. Liouville, in the discourse
which be pronounced at his grave, “ Sturm was a second Ampere:
candid like him, and like him equally indiiferent to fortune and the
vanities of   life: they both of them joined to great inventive powers,
an encyclopaedic range of knowledge:         neglected and even despised
by men of the world and the worshipers of station and power, but
exercising    an unmistakeable      impression   upon  the youth of our
schools, where genius never fails to produce its impression:       possess

     The Rev. WXLLIAM             BUCKLAND,          D.D., F.R.S., F.G.S. &c.,
Dean of Westminster           and Reader in Mineralogy and Geology                  in the
University of Oxford, was born in the year 1784, at Axminster in
Devonshire.   In 1797 he was at Tiverton School; in 1798 he en
tered St. Mary’s College, Winchester,                and passed from         it   in 1801,
to   a   scholarship in Corpus Christi College, Oxford.
   Admitted Fellow of that College in 1808, he manifested    decided          a
taste for the study of geology, then beginning to be heard of in Ox
ford in the lectures of Dr.        Kmn,      the respected Professor of Minera
logy, and beginning           to be cultivated    in London by the founders of
the Geological        While yet
                    Society.                     a child, his attention had been
caught by the ‘Cornua Ammonis,’ found in the rocks round his
home; at Winchester he began to collect the sponges and other
fossils    of the Chalk   ;   at Oxford he gathered the shells of the Oolite,
and discussed pointsof natural history on the ascent of Shotover Hill
with his frequent companion Mr. Broderip of Oriel College, who had
himself drawn no small amount of knowledge of these subjects from
the Rev. J. Townsend, the friend and fellow-labourer of William
Smith. The fruits of his <U+FB01>rst walk with Mr. Broderip formed the
nucleus of that large collection which forty years later he placed                         in
 the Oxford Museum.
     In   the period from 1808 to 1812,              Mr. Buckland       was frequently
 seen traversing on horseback        a    large part of the south-western districts
 of England, and collecting from these tracts, which had been the
 scene of Mr. Smith’s earlier labours, sections of the strata and groups
 of their organic contents.
     In   1810 and 1811 he visited with the same purpose the north                          of
 England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales.                                  ‘
     In    1813 he received the Professorship                  of Mineralogy in conse
 quence     of the resignation of Dr. Kidd           ;       he became a Fellow of the
 Geological     Society, and took his place among the most active and
 most eminent      of the inquirers into the physical history of the earth.
 The lectures which he now delivered were not con<U+FB01>ned to mineralogy,
 but embraced the discoveries and doctrines of geology, and they

                                      265
 attracted   in a high degree    the attention and admiration      of the Uni
 versity.   At length, in 1818, geology was publicly recognized in
 Oxford by the establishment of a Readership for this branch of
science, and Buckland was appointed to the o<U+FB02>ice.            From this period
the Reader gave annually one course          of lectures on mineralogy and
one on geology, sparing no pains and no expense in preparing these
instructive and suggestive discourses, in which the very latest dis
coveries always found place.
    Among his early contemporaries in Oxford none were so conspicu
ous in the cultivation of geology as the Rev. J. J. Conybeare and the
 Rev. W. D. Conybeare, both of Christ Church; and it is gratifying to
remember that the strictest personal friendship united these eminent
 men in their subsequent brilliant career.           It was   in concert with
 W. Conybeare that Bnckland gave to the press his <U+FB01>rst important
 paper “On the Coasts of the North of Ireland*,”—the result of a
 vacation tour from Oxford in 1813; and Mr. J. Conybeare was his
companion in a visit to Devon and Cornwall.
    In his journeys    to the south-west  of England be frequently called
 on the Rev. Benjamin Richardson of Farleigh Castle, near Bradford,
and the Rev. Joseph Townsend of Pewsey, ancient friends of William
 Smith, and themselves among the ablest cultivators of the new views
in geology. The latter of these eminent men imparted to the Oxford
Professor his <U+FB01>rst knowledge of the details of superposition of the
Oolite and Greensand formations between Bath and Warminster.
    In the year 1818 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and
speedily justi<U+FB01>ed his claim to this honour by communicating              to the
‘Transactions’     his well-known     account   of the teeth and bones of
the Elephant, Rhinoceros,        Hippopotamus,      Hyaena, &c., discovered
in Kirkdale Cave, 18211-.        This Essay was honoured by the Copley
Medal, and being soon after reprinted under the title of ‘Reliquiae
Diluvianeejj,’  became a powerful stimulus to the cultivation      of Geology
and Palaeontology throughout the world.             Before  the issue of this
remarkable work, the author had traversed France, Italy, the Tyrol,
Holland, Germany, and Bohemia, bringing to the now celebrated
Oxford Museum large and valuable collections, and to the geologists
of England observations of phenomena then little known to them.
One result of these successful labours was the election of Buckland to
 , * Trans. Geol. Soc. vol. iii.     1 Phil. Trans. 1822.   _    I 4to, 1823.

                                             266
  the Chair      of the Geological Society in 1824         ;  and while he held this
  o<U+FB01>ice, he received, in 1825, a valuable acknowledgement of his esta
  blished     merit in the gift of a Canonry of Christ Church.                   A   more
  important event followed,—thc happy marriage of                   Mr. Buckland to
  the excellent lady whose diligent hands and devoted aifection shared
  every toil and lightened every anxiety of his life.
     In    the same year appeared, from the united hands of Buckland
  and Conybeare,        the “Survey of the South-western Coal district of
  England,” which         even    at this day may be consulted           as one    of the
  best guides to the geology of the singular country which it describes *.
      In   1826 and 1827, he revisited the Continent              to explore parts of
’France, Germany,           Austria,     and Switzerland.        He then recognized
  the comparatively        late geological      date   of the great upward move
  ment of the       Alpsf, and declared        some   of the highly inclined rocks
  to be contemporaries of our Lias and Oolite.                  The Bone Caverns of
  Lunel and the Grotto d’OsellesI then yielded                to his strong arms and
  capacious bags many valuable spoils, now preserved in the Oxford
 Museum.          In  the <U+FB01>ve years ending with 1830, we <U+FB01>nd him present
 ing to the Geological           Society ten memoirs relating to Continental
 geology, and special researches among the fossils of Portland, Lyme
 Regis and the Mendips, the Isle of Wight, the Isle of Purbeck, and
 the coast of Weymouth.
     In   the latter memoir he was associated with one of his most valued
                                                                                          '
 friends, Sir     H. T. Dela Beche.         To this period belong many of those
 curious researches on          Coprolites and fossil Sepise, which attest at
 once the sagacity and industry of the great explorer of ossiferous
 caves.      In   1832 Dr. Buckland cooperated with Dr. Daubeny                      and
 some other       of his friends in the preparations for the Meeting of the
British Association in Oxford, and was elected President of that
brilliant and important meeting.              In   1836 appeared the Bridgewater
               ‘
Treatise,        Geology     and Mineralogy, considered with reference to
Natural Theology,’          2 vols.  8vo;   a work equally attractive and valua
                                                                     '
ble to the student.
    The volumes of the Geological Society subsequent to 1833 contain
many valuable notices of the unwearied labours of Dr. Buckland, one
of the later and more interesting being              a paper on the
                                                                       “ Glacio-Dilu

 Linnean Society of      a paper on the adaptation           of Sloths to their way
 of life1' (1835); and furnished many essays and notices on special
 subjects of interest to the Philosophical Magazine, Silliman’s Journal,
 the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, and the Reports of the British
 Association.     The list published by Agassiz of the works and essays
 which bear the name of Buckland, extends to 66—spread over the
 whole period of his life in Oxford since 1813. In 1845 he became
 Dean    of Westminster, and changed his residence, but not his habits
of mental and bodily exertion.               Sanitary measures,     amendments in
his Cathedral, agricultural improvements, the potato disease,--all oc
 cupied his attention, and consumed his time, so that from this time
 he almost ceased      to labour      as an author, though       he still continued
 with unabated    zeal the duties       of his Professorship.
    Dr. Buckland‘s numerous publications                 include  very largely       the
results of personal observation, on features of physical                 geography,
the succession of strata, the distribution of glacial detritus, the struc
ture, habits of life, manner of death, and mode of occurrence of ex
tinct animals.      To him, more than to any geologist,             are we indebted
for unexpected suggestions, curious inquiries, and novel kinds of evi
dence.      Thus in Kirkdale Cave, the peculiar condition of the broken
bones——the smoothed surfaces of some—theworn                  aspect of others—the
condition of the teeth—the layers of Stalagmite--the ‘Album Graecum’
-became in the mind of Buckland evidence of the mode of life and
death of the former inhabitants.               The footprints of Cheirotherium
were joined with the ripple-mark of the rain-spot to determine the
character of the mesozoie shore :—Coprolites were searched for the
food   of the Ichthyosaurus; snails were studied to explain holes in
limestone; gelatine was extracted from the Mammoth’s bones; toads
were enclosed in cavities to determine their tenacity of life ; the living
hyaena was set to crush the bones of an ox, and thus to furnish evi
dence for the conviction          of the old midnight robber of preglacial
caverns.
   Of    general views on geology,            Dr. Buckland was sparing            as an
author, though frequently             and eloquently      he declared     them as a
Professor.      Physical Geology in its higher forms had scarcely exist
ence   in the earlier part of his career. Instead of contributing to its
        * Geol. Soc. Proc.  vol. iii.      _          1‘  Linn. Trans. vol. xvii.

                                      268
progress in after-years, he laboured wisely and well in the rich <U+FB01>eld
of special discovery: now collecting and describing the mighty rep
tiles like Plesiosaurus and Iguanodon, or the <U+FB02>ying wonder the
Pterodactylus; at another time studying the beaks of Chimaera, the
wings of Neuroptera,      the ink-bags of $epiadae; now questioning the
great English Botanist on the reticulated stems of Cycadeoideae,           and
fathoming the mind of Owen on the little Marsupialia of Stones<U+FB01>eld,
or inviting the eagle glance of Cuvier on the serrated teeth of            Me
yalosaurus    Buc/clandi.
    So passed the life of this man, strong in mind and strong in body ;
working hard and setting others            to  work  ; gathering  and giving
knowledge;      a patient   student, a powerful     teacher, a friendly   asso
ciate;   a valiant  soldier for Geology in days when she was weak, an
honoured leader in her hour of triumph.
    Perhaps of all the varied marks of respect which were heaped upon
him by the learned     societies in all parts of the world, none yielded him
higher grati<U+FB01>cation      than that which threw a ray of splendour over
his latest appearance at the meetings of the Geological         Society.   For
there, in February 1848, he received from the hands of Sir               H. T.
De la Beche, with very appropriate expressions, the Wollaston Medal,
which is the highest mark of honour known in Geological Science—
an honour which would, doubtless, long before have been paid to
him, but for the frequency of his election to office in that Society*.
In the reply of Dr. Buckland to the Address of the President, we <U+FB01>nd
expressions such as could only be uttered by a geologist convinced           of
the grand destiny of his science, and conscious of his own right to be
remembered among the authors of            “ discoveries whose  names are   in
scribed on the annals of the physical          history of the globe.”     And
these are followed by Words which embody a              humble confession of
the comparative littleness       and incompleteness of all human know
ledge—words       too prophetic    of the approaching close of his own
valuable and honourable career,—for within two short years that
apparently indefatigable mind ceased from its labours, and only the
form of Buckland survived till the 15th of August, 1856.
    DR. WII.LIAM FREDERICK            CHAMBERS died of paralysis in De
cember 1855, aged 69 years.            Prior to his retirement from active

                                        269
  life on account     of the disorder which <U+FB01>nally proved fatal, he had for
  many years had the most extensive practice as a physician of any in
  London.       The mental character to which he owed this distinction is
 interesting as a subject of psychological        study, and valuable as an
 example      and encouragement to those who desire to lead a similar life
 of usefulness.        His intellectual  powers were not of that order to
 which it is usual to apply the term “genius         :” no original discovery,
 no    striking innovation     marked his career.     Nor   was he a man     of
                                                                         “
 very sparkling talent: there was nothing that could be           called   bril
 liancy” in his thought, his writing, or his mode of action. What he
 possessed in an eminent degree was, wisdom, judgment—that pecu
 liar balance of faculties which enables a man to think soundly and to
 be a safe adviser and guardian.         The circumstances of his life had
 helped to give this form          to his character.    He had received his
 public education at Westminster         and Cambridge, where the studies
 are such as to cultivate      in an equal degree the imaginative and scien
 ti<U+FB01>c faculties.       The postponement of his entrance on special profes
 sional studies till he was three-and-twenty years of age, enabled him
 to   bring to   these studies, when he   did engage  in them,  a fully-formed
mind, and so to escape the danger often arising from crude prejudices
acquired in early studentship.          His election, at the age  of thirty, as
Physician to St. George's Hospital, kept him afterwards closely to
the'duties of practical life, from which he was never distracted by
special scienti<U+FB01>c inquiries; and accordingly his lectures on the prac
tice    of medicine and the lectures on cholera, which       at the request  of
his colleagues he gave in 1833, with the addresses which he delivered
as President of the Medical and Chirurgical Society in 1846 and
1847, constitute the bulk of what he has published              to the world.
He became          a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1828, and through life
was a conspicuous illustration of the intimate connexion between
sound      science   and practical usefulness.
      SIR ALEXANDER CRICHTON,           second son of Mr. AlexanderCrichton
of    Woodhouselee       and Newington in    Mid Lothian,   was born in   Edin
burgh on the 2nd of December, 1763.                He received his elementary
education in his native town, and afterwards              matriculated    in its
University.          He was placed at an early      age  with Mr. Alexander
Wood,        a surgeon     of eminence in Edinburgh.        At the expiration

                                      270
  of his apprenticeship,     in 1784, Mr. Crichton     came   to London to
  prosecute his studies, more especially anatomy,         and the following
  spring he went to Leyden,        in company with Mr. Robert Jackson,
  who     became  afterwards   so favourably    known   by his writings on
  subjects connected with military surgery.          Though Mr. Crichton
  had been brought up        with  the view of prosecuting surgery as his
  profession, he thought it advisable to submit himself to the neces
  sary examinations before the Professors of Leyden for the degree of
  M.D., which he obtained in July 1785.
     After passing a short time in Holland, he proceeded to Paris to
  perfect himself in the French language, and to avail himself of the
  facilities afforded in that city for advancement in every department
  of medical knowledge.
     Leaving Paris in the summer of 1786, Dr. Crichton studied           suc
  cessively at Stuttgardt,    Vienna, and Halle, residing, during his stay
  at the last-named     University, in the house of Professor Meckel, the
  second celebrated anatomist of that name.           He then passed some
  time in Berlin and in Giittiugen,      where he remained till September
   1788.     Returning from Germany, where he had spent three years
  in the acquisition of medical and scienti<U+FB01>c knowledge, Dr. Crichton
  established himself in London as a surgeon, and became a member
  of the Corporation of Surgeons in May 1789. But not liking the
  operative part of the surgical profession, he withdrew from that
  body on May 1, 1791, and became a licentiate of the Royal College
  of Physicians    on the 25th    of June,   1791 ; shortly after which he
  was appointed      Physician to    a large   Dispensary   in Featherstone
  Build’ngs, Holborn. There, in conjunction with Dr. Bradley, he
  formed a “ Clinical Institution,” upon a plan similar to that followed
‘
  at the    University of Géttingen,     and delivered Lectures   upon the
  most remarkable      and instructive cases which presented themselves.
  About     1796 Dr.    Crichton was elected Physician to the         West
  minster Hospital, and during his connexion with that institution he
  was in the practice of delivering      three courses of lectures;  viz. on
  Chemistry,    on Materia Medica, and on the Practice       of Physic.    In
  1798 he published      his work on Mental Derangement, which gained
  him reputation     at home    and abroad; and having now attained          a
  high professional position, he was appointed Physician to the Duke
  of Cambridge. In 1803 Dr. Crichton was invited to become physician

                                           271
 in    ordinary     to   His Imperial Majesty Alexander                   I.   of Russia.
 Having accepted this appointment, he was kindly received in St;
 Petersburgh, and soon gained the full con<U+FB01>dence and esteem of the
Emperor and the several members of the imperial                         family.     In   the
course of     a    few years he was also appointed                to the head of the
Civil Medical Department, in which capacity he                       was much consulted
by the Empress Dowager, in the construction                           and regulation      of
many institutions         which   owe     their   origin   to her active charity and
watchful superintendence.
  Dr. Crichton’s exertions to mitigate the horrors of an epidemic
which was devastating the south-east provinces of Russia in 1809
were acknowledged          by   the Emperor,      who conferred on him the title
of Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Vladimir, Third Class.
In 1814 His Imperial Majesty bestowed on him that of the Second
Class for his long and faithful services, and as “ Médecin en chef pour
la    partie Civile.”     Having obtained         leave    of   absence    on account of
the state of his health, he returned to this country in the spring of
                                                                                               ___4~
1819.       The following year, however, he           was recalled to attend the
Grand Duchess Alexandra (the present Dowager Empress), whom he
accompanied, on her convalescence, to the court of Berlin, where he
stayed  short time, and then returned to his family.
          a                                                                   On the 27th
of December, 1820, His Majesty Frederick William                       III.    created him
Knight Grand Cross of the Red Eagle, Second Class. In 1821
Dr. Crichton was knighted by His Majesty George IV., and obtained
the royal permission to wear his foreign orders.             The late Emperor
Nicholas      I.   also marked his sense      of the services of Sir Alexander
Crichton by bestowing upon him the additional title of Knight
Grand Cross of the Order of St. Anne, in August 1830.
     Dr. Crichton married, in 1800, Frances, daughter of Mr. Edward
Dodwell, of West Moulsey.                He   was one     of the oldest members of
the Linnean and Royal Societies, having been elected                      a    member of
the <U+FB01>rst in 1793, and of the latter in 1800.                    He   was member     of the
Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburgh, and of the Im
perial Society of Naturalists of Moscow, and Corresponding Member
of the Royal Society of Sciences of Gottingen, of the Royal Institute
of Medicine at Paris, and of many other societies. His writings
were the following :-
  A Translation of Dr.      J.   F.   Blumenbach’s   Essay on Generation.           1792.

                                      274
 habits orderly     and business-like;    his constitution   naturally robust,
 and,   till he reached old  age, capable  of great exertion and endurance.‘
 These qualities, in circumstances       so favourable to their exercise as
 those of the Peninsular       war, quickly and justly placed him in the
 <U+FB01>rst rank of military surgeons, and accomplished a large amount of
 good in the medical department of the Army. In after-life, the same
 qualities, strengthened by success, ensured great in<U+FB02>uence for what he
 taught, gained for him a large private practice in surgery, and made
 him   a man much to be considered in all the questions        of professional
 interest in which he was engaged.         His in<U+FB02>uence on the progress of
 medical science in his own time was that of an earnest advocate and
 an   attractive   teacher of whatever      appeared simple and straight
 forward in practice, and of all surgical doctrines that professed to be
 based upon correct anatomy.         In the future history of surgery, he
 will  be remembered     for his advocacy of the use of nitrate of silver in
 purulent ophthalmia, of large incisions in phlegmonous erysipelas,
 of acid escharotics in sloughing phagedaena, and for the skill and
 boldness of his treatment of gun-shot wounds.            But, especially, his
 name will probably be always mentioned with honour for his main
 tenance of the general necessity of tying wounded arteries at the
 very seat of injury, above and below the opening.         The usual practice
 had been to tie the artery at some convenient part above the wound,
 on   the assumption     that the arrest or diminished force of the circu
 lation would allow the <U+FB01>rm closure of the wound,             as it  does  the
 obliteration    of an aneurismal   sac.    Few things in modern surgical
 works are equal in strength and cleamess to the chapters in which
 Mr. Guthrie proved the error of such an assumption, and the advan
 tages   of his own mode of practice.       In anatomy, his best work was
the bringing to general knowledge the muaculi compressores           uretlme,
which, though described by Santorini, had nearly ceased to be recog
nized.       In the medical department of the Army, his in<U+FB02>uence            for
good was undoubtedly considerable.          It may be di<U+FB02>icult to enumerate
the improvements that were due to him           ; but, as the last edition   of
his best work—~the      ‘Commentaries on the Surgery of the War’- will
prove, he was to the very end of life urgent in promoting            the em
ciency of military hospital-establishments,        and in maintaining      the
reputation of the medical o<U+FB01>icers of the Army.

      DANIEL Susana         was born   in London in 1806.      His mother, who
   died a few weeks after his       birth,  was sister to Samuel     Rogers the
  poet.     He   was educated at Walthamstow,       and as a boy early showed
   a taste  for the study of natural history, but he did not commence
  seriously to work at geology        till he  was  admitted   a Fellow of the
   Geological     Society in June 1829.       In-the   same   year he gave his
  <U+FB01>rst memoir       to the Society,   “On    a new species   of Ichthyosaurus,
   &c.”-—I. grandipes—which, however, it afterwards appeared, had
  been previously described by Conybeare, under the name of I. tenu2'
  rostris.
      Throughout the greater part of his life Mr. Sharpe was actively
  engaged as a merchant, and his business connexion with the wine
  growing districts of Portugal occasionally leading him there, in 1832,
   1839, 1848 and 1849 he gave to the Geological            Society a series    of
  memoirs on the rocks in the neighbourhood             of Lisbon and Oporto.
  The <U+FB01>rst is        a  mere sketch     of the general arrangement         of the
 Tertiary and Secondary rocks by a young and intelligent geologist ;—
  the second, on the same subject, is fuller and more de<U+FB01>nite, but not
  sufficiently complete in the determination of fossils to <U+FB01>x the precise
 age    of the strata described.        It contains, however, in an appendix,
 some observations of great value on the comparative eifects of the
 great earthquake of 1755 on the strata on which Lisbon stands.              The
 destructive      e<U+FB01>'ects of this shock were chie<U+FB02>y con<U+FB01>ned to the           area
 occupied by the soft tertiary beds, while the buildings erected on the
 more      solid Hippurite    limestone    and chalk   escaped   entirely.    The
 line of division between the shattered and entire buildings corre
 sponded precisely with the boundaries of the strata.          This subject has
 since been elaborated by       Mr. Mallet in his Reports on Earthquakes to
the British Association.          In his third memoir Mr. Sharpe describes
the granitic, gneissic, clay-slate and coal-bearing rocks of Vallongo
near Oporto. The clay-slate he proved by its fossils to be of Lower
 Silurian     age, and his sections show that the strata bearing anthracitic
coal underlie the slate, and rest on gneiss pierced by granite.                He
thence concluded that the coal is of Lower Silurian age. In the
present      state  of knowledge regarding that country, it is impossible to
deny that this may be the case, but it must be remembered that the

 age;   and even those geologists who most strenuously             support  the
 so-called uniformitarian    doctrines,   incline   to attribute  the peculiar
 position of the coal to one of those great inversions of the strata so
 frequent in highly disturbed districts of all ages, from Palseozoic‘up
 to Tertiary times.
    The fourth paper commences with a succinct sketch of the general
 geology of Portugal, and goes on to de<U+FB01>ne the limits of the secondary
 rocks north of the Tagus, both by stratigraphical and palaeontological
 evidence.     Long before this paper was read, Mr. Sharpe had
 acquired much critical skill and knowledge as a palaaontologist, and
 on palseontological   principles   he now established        the existence of
 Cretaceous and Jurassic rocks in the country described.            The whole
 formed an excellent sketch    of a hitherto undescribed country, and up
 to this date British geologists are chie<U+FB02>y indebted to these memoirs
 for the knowledge they     possess of   a land where the science is almost
 uncultivated.
    Between 1842 and 1844        Mr. Sharpe       gave   four memoirs to the
 Geological Society on‘ the Silurian and Old Red Sandstone Rocks of
Wales and the North of England, territories previously chie<U+FB02>y illus
trated by the labours of Professor Sedgwick.              The <U+FB01>rst of these is
 “On    the Geology of the South        of Westmoreland.”         Part of this
paper describes the range of the Coniston            limestone.    Mr. Sharpe
identi<U+FB01>ed it by its fossils as forming part of the Lower Silurian series,
but did not determine its actual horizon.              In  1839  Mr. Marshall
placed   it on the parallel of the Caradoc sandstone, which determina
tion the researches of later geologists have sustained.
    Mr. Sharpe also pointed out the unconformity of the Upper on
the Lower Silurian rocks of the area;         and in describing the passage
of the Ludlow rocks into the Old Red Sandstone, he correctly infers
that the Tilestones of South Wales should be withdrawn from the base
of the Old Red Sandstone and classi<U+FB01>ed with the Ludlow rocks, to
which their fossils unite them.       At a later period of the same year
he produced a    memoir   “ On the Bala Limestone, and other portions
of the Older Palseozoic Rocks of North Wales.”              Up  to this date it
was believed that at   Bala and elsewhere there         was a great thickness
of fossiliferous   Upper Cambrian       rocks   below the Lower Silurian
strata.   Mr. Sharpe maintained that this was an error, and that both
stratigraphically,  and by their fossils, the Bala rocks were the equi

                                      277
valents of the Llandeilo <U+FB02>ags and Caradoc sandstone.           This sagacious
determination has since been con<U+FB01>rmed by           Mr. Salter  as regards the
Caradoc     sandstone;     the fossils of Bala and the typical        Caradoc
sandstone of Sir Roderick Murchison in Shropshire            being the same.
    The more elaborate paper of       1844 is accompanied by a geological
map of North Wales,            and is less happy.      Mr. Sharpe’s genius
chie<U+FB02>y lay in the palaeontological determination of the age of rocks,
and, in this case at least, the time he allowed himself to map North
Wales was too short for the satisfactory elucidation of the problems
he proposed to solve.
    Pursuing at intervals     these subjects, Mr‘. Sharpe produced in 1847
an elaborate analysis and comparison of the Silurian fossils of North
America (collected by Sir Charles Lyell) with those of Great Britain,
and con<U+FB01>rmed the views entertained by the American geologist,             Mr.
Hall, that the American Silurian strata, like the British, consist of
                                                           ’
two great divisions, viz. Upper and Lower.
    While   engaged   in these investigations, Mr. Sharpe's attention     was
drawn to the subject of slaty cleavage          and foliation, which   affects
the more ancient rocks of Devonshire, Wales, the North of England,
the Highlands of Scotland, and Mont Blanc.             In  1846, 1848, l852
and 1854 he produced four memoirs on these subjects, the two <U+FB01>rst
and the last of which are published in the Journal of the Geological
Society,    and the third in the Philosophical Transactions.            These
questions had previously been made the subject of special investiga
tion by Professor Sedgwick,          Mr. Darwin, and Professor Phillips.
It has been said that from imperfect data Mr. Sharpe generalized
too largely; and though this may be the case, an attentive perusal of
the memoir       of 1846 proves that    in some important     points he mate
rially advanced the subject at that date in the direction to which the
labours of Mr. Sorby have since tended.           He attributes the cleavage
of rocks, and consequent distortion of fossils, to pressure perpen
dicular to the planes of cleavage, and asserts that rocks are expanded
along the cleavage planes in the direction of the dip of the cleavage.
In    the communication        of 1848, the doctrine that pressure is the
cause    of  cleavage  is still more distinctly insisted on, and remarkable
instances are given in which pebbleawere observed which appeared to
have been compressed and elongated in the planes of cleavage.              He
 also recognizes the fact, since so beautifully     explained by   Mr. Sorby,
     VOL.  VIII.                                                  Z

                                     278
that the <U+FB01>ne particles composing the slaty rocks are arranged length
wise in the direction of the cleavage planes, and he attributes bends in
the cleavage in its passage from one bed to another, to beds of different
lithological character offering different degrees of resistance to pres
sure.    The idea that  cleavage may be due to crystalline     action, he alto
gether repudiates.      The two last of the   series, published in 1852 and
 1854, describe respectively the cleaved and foliated rocks of Scotland
and Mont Blanc, and are chie<U+FB02>y devoted to the development of his
                                    ” or arches, in which he asserted that
theory    of the great “ cylinders
the laminae of cleaved and foliated rocks lie.          In these memoirs he
made no advance beyond his previous ideas, for he attributed the
formation of cleavage and foliation to the same cause; and though
he indicated    the fact, he gave no explanation       of the reason of the
 occurrence    of planes of cleavage and foliation        in arched lines,     a
 subject that has since in part been acutely treated of by         Mr. Sorby,
 and of which the full explanation seems not far distant.
     Besides these memoirs,    Mr. Sharpe contributed to the Geological
 Society various papers on special subjects       :-“ On     the Quartz Rock
                                          ” “On     the Southern Borders of
 of MacCulloch’s Map of Scotland        ;
 the Highlands of Scotland ;” and various palaeontological communi
                                        ” “ On
 cations: “ On the genus Trematis ;               Tylostoma, a new genus of
                                             of
                                                             ” “ On the
 Gasteropods from the Cretaceous beds           Portugal   ;             genus
 Nerinzea ;” and a note on the fossils of the Boulonnais,         appended to
 a paper by    Mr. Austen on that district.        He also furnished several
 parts of a Monograph to the splendid publications of the Palaeonto
                      “ On the Fossil Remains of the Mollusca found in
 graphical Society,
 the Chalk formation       of England,” and on this important work he
 was still engaged when he met with the unhappy accident that caused
 his untimely death.
     Such is a brief outline of   some  of the scienti<U+FB01>c labours of Daniel
 Sharpe—a man, whose mind alike powerful and active, and well
 cultivated, urged him successfully to grasp and make his own a
 wider    range of subjects     than   many   geologists     dare to attempt.
 Neither should it    be forgotten   that all the while he     was unceasingly
 engaged in mercantile pursuits, and it was only during brief intervals
 of leisure, when more imperative labours were over, that he accom
  plished   what many would consider       su<U+FB02>icient    work for their lives.
  And it is not in geology alone that he is known and appreciated:

                                      279
 philologists and ethnologists equally esteemed him. With marvel
 lous versatility of talent he grappled with the ancient Lycian in
 scriptions, brought home by Fellows, Forbes and Spratt, and revealed
 the secrets of an unknown     tongue written in an unknown character.
     In debate he was clear, keen,    severely critical, and at times some
 what sarcastic, occasionally alarming     to an opponent unaccustomed
  to his style; but those who knew him best were well aware that an
  unvarying fund of kindly good humour lay beneath, and that              if he
 hit his adversary hard, no man than himself more rejoiced in         a harder
 blow in return.     His private life was full of unostentatious       benevo
 lence.    In  conversation with his familiars    he was intelligent,   lively,
 and quick in perception, and his attached friends          of the Geological
 Club, of which he lately was President by virtue of his o<U+FB01>ice as head
 of the Society, will long mourn his loss, and miss the quaint humour
 and quiet laugh that so often helped to animate their board.
     Mr. Sharpe was    a  Fellow of the Linnean, Zoological, and Geo
 logical Societies.   In   1853 he became Treasurer of the Geological
 Society,   and on the retirement      of Mr. Hamilton was elected its
 President in 1856.      In 1850 he    was elected   a  Fellow of the Royal
 Society.     On the 20th of last May, while riding near Norwood, he
 was thrown from his horse, and sustained a fracture of the skull.
 In  a few days he so far recovered as to be able to recognize the rela
 tions that were admitted to his chamber, and his numerous friends
 rejoiced   in the prospect of his speedy restoration; but a sudden
 relapse succeeded, and he died on the 31st of May, sorrowed for by
 all who knew his worth.
    JAMES MEADOWS RENDEL            was born in 17 99, at a village on the
borders of Dartmoor, in Devonshire       ; his grandfather, Mr. Meadows,
 F.R.S.,  was a well-known    architect, and his father, who was a county
surveyor and farmer, was a man of ability, excellent common sense
and determination of character, qualities which descended         to the son,
whilst to his mother, who     was a woman    of considerable acquirements,
he owed the rudiments of his early education.
    After being practically instructed in the executive part of his pro
fession, he went to London and obtained an engagement under Mr.
Telford, by whom he was employed on the survey              and  experiments
for the proposed suspension bridge over the Mersey,         at Runcorn,    and
                                                                 z 2

                                          280
 subsequently on the survey and construction of roads in the north of
 Devon, where the difficulties           he had to contend with contributed
 much to create that self-reliance so useful to him in his subsequent
 career.     At that period he      was    introduced    to the Earl of Morley,
 who    discovering     the   latent talents of      the young      engineer,  then
 scarcely twenty-<U+FB01>ve years of age, con<U+FB01>ded to him, with the approval
 of Mr. Telford, the construction            of   a cast-iron   bridge   across the
 Lary,   an arm     of the   sea  within the Harbour of Plymouth.              This
 bridge, consisting of <U+FB01>ve elliptical arches, was, with the exception of
 that of Southwark,       the largest cast-iron structure of the kind in the
 kingdom.       Its construction, in which Mr. Rendel            was   engaged be
 tween 1824 and 1827, presented many difficulties                  demanding con
 siderable skill and decision on the part of the engineer;                but these
 di<U+FB02>iculties   were successfully overcome, and for the account of this
work the Telford Medal of the Institution of Civil Engineers                    was
awarded to him.         About this period he designed and executed the
Boucombe       Bridge, where hydraulic power             was   for the <U+FB01>rst time
applied to the machinery for working swing bridges.
    Soon after the completion of the Lary Bridge,              Mr. Rendel settled
in Plymouth, and there exercised his profession with great activity,
being engaged in surveying          and reporting      upon nearly all the har
bours in the South-west          of England, and executing the works at a
large number of places, acquiring            that mastery over Hydraulic        En
gineering     on which his fame will chie<U+FB02>y rest.             He was extensively
employed by the Exchequer              Loan Commissioners; in many cases
executing the works thus authorized.
    In the year 1831 he introduced a new system of crossing rivers by
means    of Floating Bridges worked by          steam  power; they were applied
at Saltash and at Torpoint, on the river Tamar, and subsequently at
Southampton        and Portsmouth      ;  but the rapid progress of the railway
system prevented the further development of this useful invention,
for which the Telford Medal               was  awarded.      Descriptions    of the
structure of these bridges, as well as of that over the Lary, were pub-'
lished in the Transactions        of the Institution of Civil Engineers.
    The repairs of the Montrose Suspension Bridge, after its fall, were
con<U+FB01>ded to him, and he there introduced the system of imparting
that rigidity to the platform of the roadway which is now admitted
to be so essential to the safety of these structures.                 He was also

                                                                                   5
                                        281
engaged in the surveys for a railway between Exeter and Plymouth,
but the necessary funds not being provided, the      scheme was abandoned,
and the district eventually        falling under the control of the Great
Western Railway Company, the present line of railway was constructed
by Mr. Brunel.
   In the year 1838 Mr. Rendel removed            to London, where he         was
soon consulted upon many important works, and was engaged in the
chief parliamentary contests of that remarkable period in the history
of engineering. About this time he designed the Pier at Millbay,
where he introduced the system of construction since employed with
so much success      at the harbours of Holyhead and Portland.                En
gagements poured in fast upon him, and his career was for the next
few years one of unceasing activity,          chie<U+FB02>y in the construction        of
Harbours or Docks, and the improvement of Rivers and Estuaries.
   In the year 1843, the projected construction of Docks at Birken
head, in Cheshire, of such an extent as to create a formidable rival to
Liverpool, brought Mr. Rendel very prominently before the world;
and the protracted contests on this subject will be long remembered
in the history of Parliamentary Committees, for the ability with which
he defended his positions      ;  and the evidence given by him and other
Engineers,    as now collected, forms a valuable record         of the  state   of
engineering practice.      The almost incessant labour, and the mental
anxiety inseparable from this undertaking,         were more than even his
powerful constitution could support, and it is feared that they tended
to shorten his valuable life.
   The daring project of constructing         a dock at Great Grimsby,         by
projecting the works       far out upon the mud-banks            of the River
Humber, was next successfully accomplished; and he commenced
the two great works which alone su<U+FB01>ice to hand down his name to
posterity,    beside   those     of Smeaton, Rennie,      and Telford,——the
Harbours      of Refuge      of Holyhead and Portland;              both these
                                                            '
works    were conceived with the largest views, and have been
carried    on   with great rapidity.        In both   cases   the system      was
adopted of establishing timber stages over the line of the jetties and
depositing    the large and small stones together, as they came from
the quarries, by dropping them vertically from railway waggons into
their positions ; thus bringing up the mass simultaneously to above
the level of the sea.       In this manner as much as 24,000 tons of

                                       282
stone   have been     deposited in one week, and to supply           this  vast
demand, monster -blasts of <U+FB01>ve or six tons of gunpowder were fre
quently employed.        These two great works are advancing very satis
factorily ;  and it is worthy of remark, that although the severe storms
which have repeatedly occurred on the exposed coasts where they
are situated, have done some injury to portions of the stages, and of
the temporary works, at Holyhead—where the piles were not shod
with Mitchell’s screws, which proved         so successful at  Portland—not
a stone would appear to have been           carried away from the jetties;
and the success of the system may be said to be complete, in spite of
the sinister predictions which prevailed before it was tried.
    Among the other        works upon which       Mr. Rendel     was  engaged,
 should also be mentioned       the constructions    on the River Lea,      and
the improvements       of the Nene river; the latter an undertaking of
considerable di<U+FB01>iculty, and not yet completed.         He was also employed
by the Exchequer       Loan Commissioners       to report upon the drainage
and other public works in Ireland.
    He  was less engaged     in railways than in hydraulic works, but in
England he executed the Birkenhead, Lancashire, and Cheshire
Junction Line, and in India he had the direction of the “East
         ” and the “ Madras
Indian                             Railways,” the former projected by Mr.
 (now Sir Rowland) Macdonald Stevenson, as the <U+FB01>rst of the vast
 system now in progress which will doubtless exert a mighty in<U+FB02>uence
on the future destiny of the-Indian Empire.             The Ceylon and the
 Pernambuco lines were also under his charge.
    It would unduly extend this          sketch to notice in particular the
various hydraulic works upon which             Mr. Rendel    was  engaged, as
 there was scarcely a harbour       or _river of importance in the kingdom
with which     he was not connected      in some capacity.     His advice was
 also sought by foreign countries      ; and he was engaged to report upon
 works for the Brazilian, the Prussian and the Sardinian governments,
 and was nominated by the Viceroy of Egypt a Member of the               Inter
national    Commission     for considering    the construction   of the Canal
 across the Isthmus of Suez.
    He  was a man     of great energy, clear perception, and correct judg
 ment; his practical knowledge was well directed, and he knew how
 to make good use of the scienti<U+FB01>c acquirements and skill of all whose
 services he engaged.       His evidence before Parliamentary Committees

                                                                                   -.
                                      283
 was   lucid and    convincing,——seldom     failing in carrying his point;
 and his Reports      on Engineering     works    are  distinguished    by the
clearness and correctness of his views and the fearless expression of
his opinion, and are so well conceived and drawn up, that it may be
hoped they will be given to the world.         With these qualities, which
were fully appreciated, it need scarcely be added that he rose rapidly
to a very high position      in his profession.     He  became     a Fellow of
the Royal Society in 1843, and was elected upon the Council;                 he
was a very early Member           of the Institution of Civil Engineers,
having joined    it in 1824.     He had been for the last sixteen years
upon the Council, and held the post of President             during the years
 1852 and 1853.
    Mr.   Rendel was as amiable and kind in private life as he was
energetic and <U+FB01>rm in public, and his decease, which           occurred on the
21st of November, 1856, cast a gloom over the whole of the profession
of which he    was a  brilliant ornament.
    Rear-Admiral      FREDERICK        WILLIAM        BEECHEY,       V.P.R.S.,
P.R.G.S., was the second son of the eminent painter Sir William
Beechey, R.A.        He was born on the 17th of February, 1796, and
his godfather was     H.R.H.    the Duke of Clarence, afterwards William
the Fourth.
   VVhen only ten years of age, he was sent to sea on board the
‘
  Hibernia,’ under the immediate patronage of Lord St. Vincent            ; and
it may be justly presumed that the well-known sentiments and prac-               .
tice of that stem disciplinarian had no small in<U+FB02>uence in forming the
young seaman’s professional character, and especially in inspiring
that unremitting activity and devotion to duty for which in after
life he was conspicuous.
    After  a short time passed on board the
                                                ‘
                                                  Minotaur,’ young Beechey
went with the gallant Sir Sidney Smith,            in the ‘Foudroyant,’ to
Brazil.     In 1811 he served on board the ‘Astraea,’         frigate, Captain
Schomberg, and as an ardent youth of <U+FB01>fteen, and captain’s aid-de
camp, shared in those long and gallant actions oif Madagascar,                in
which his ship bore      a part, and  which ended in the capture of two
 French frigates, and the surrender to the British of the Fort and
 Settlement of Tamatave.         After this he remained a short time on
 the home station,_ and in 1815 was on board the ‘Vengeur’               in the

                                         284
Expedition against New Orleans, and took part in the operations on
the Mississippi in support of the general attack on the American
                                    ‘           ’
lines.    While on board the          Tonnant     he received his commission as
Lieutenant,      dated 10th of March, 1815, and in the following year
was     appointed      to the    ‘Niger,’   frigate,    on the North-American
 station.
    In January       1818, when he had been nearly twelve years in active
 service,   Lieutenant Beechey commenced his career as an Arctic
 voyager, under his friend the late Sir John Franklin, in the Trent,’
                                                                          ‘
 which vessel was associated with the ‘ Dorothea,’ Captain Buchan, in
 an attempt        to   discover a northern        communication     between    the
 Atlantic and Paci<U+FB01>c Oceans.              In this Expedition many important
 scienti<U+FB01>c observations were made, and much useful information                  was
 gained respecting the coast of Spitzbergen and the sea adjacent;               and
 it is worthy of note, that, with the exception perhaps of             some early
 voyages by the Dutch, this,            and the contemporaneous         voyage of
 Captain Ross to Ba<U+FB01>in’s Bay,              were   the <U+FB01>rst  in which very      deep
 soundings were obtained;          mud and stone being brought up from the
 bottom at a depth of more than a thousand fathoms, by means of
 the contrivance        called   “deep-sea    clamms.”-     A  narrative    of this
 Expedition was published by Lieut. Beechey in 1843, and has often
 been favourably noticed by foreign as well as English journals.                 On
 his return      from     this  voyage, Beechey and his         late commander,
  Lieutenant     Franklin, volunteered        to attempt    to reach the North
  Pole by     a   journey over the ice; and with this view they sub
  mitted to the Admiralty a plan of proceeding, which was afterwards
 adopted, and to        a  great extent carried out by Sir Edward Parry in
  1827.
     In January 1819 Lieutenant Beechey             was appointed to the   fHecla,’
  under the command of Lieutenant               (afterwards  Sir  Edward) Parry,
  with whom he penetrated to the western longitude of 113° 55',
  within the Arctic Circle, wintered at Melville Island, and shared the
                                                      '
  Parliamentary       reward of £5000.
     In  these   Arctic expeditions the merits of Lieut. Beechey as               an
 able and vigilant o<U+FB01>icer, a skilful astronomical observer, and                   an
 accomplished        draughtsman,      met with general recognition;         but it
  was also     in   these    memorable     voyages,—through        hardships    and
  exertions, disregarded as usual at the time by a young and ardent

                                    285
adventurer,—-that     the foundation    was   laid  of disease,   which was
destined to terminate prematurely      his valuable life.
    In January  1821  Lieut. Beechey   was appointed to the ‘ Adventure,’
then commanded by Captain         (now Rear-Admiral Smyth); and in
November of the same year, he was detached from the ship in charge
of an Expedition along the northern shores of Africa, and round the
greater   Syrtis towards Egypt.      In this Expedition Lieut. Beechey
surveyed all the coast between Tripoli and Derna, explored the
country and antiquities of the Cyrenaica, and determined the sites of
the <U+FB01>ve cities of the Pentapolis.     In this service he was accompanied
by his brother Mr. Henry Beechey, whose intimate knowledge of the
language, as well as of the manners and customs of the inhabitants,
acquired    whilst with Messrs.     Salt   and   Belzoni   during their re
searches among the Pyramids, was of the greatest assistance.               An
account of this interesting Expedition was published in 1828.
    While    on  this service Lieut. Beechey       was   promoted;     and in
January    1825 was appointed to command the        ‘Blossom’ on    a voyage
to the Paci<U+FB01>c and Arctic Oceans, intendedto            co-operate with the
 Polar Expeditions    under Parry and Franklin.        During this voyage
he passed twice through Behring’s Strait, and explored the north
west coast of America, 120 miles beyond the farthest point of Cook,
attaining   to lat. 71°   N. and long.    156° W.,——a     spot scarcely 150
miles from the extreme point reached by Franklin             overland.    The
intervals   between the seasons available for Arctic navigation          were
passed in visiting    many parts of the Paci<U+FB01>c Ocean, where be dis
covered and made       surveys of several    new islands, and contributed
 largely to the hydrography and general knowledge of those regions.
 In 1827 Commander Beechey was promoted to the rank of Captain,
 and in the following year returned        to England with his ship,        in
 which, notwithstanding      her dull sailing,   he had traversed 73,000
 miles, and rendered valuable service to navigation and general science.
 In   1831 he published    a narrative   of this voyage, replete with in
 teresting  and valuable    information,    and evincing     throughout    the
 high quali<U+FB01>cations    of the author for the conduct of such        an  Expe
                “
 dition.
     In 1835 Captain Beechey was appointed to the          ‘
                                                             Sulphur,’ to un
 dertake another voyage of exploration        and survey, but the inroads
 which engrossing pursuits      and incessant mental activity       had even

                             4          286
then made in his health, obliged him to return home from Valparaiso
in 1836.
   After an interval      of leisure passed with his family, his ardent
desire   of active employment induced him, in 1837, to accept an
appointment to conduct various surveys of the Irish Sea and the
Western Coasts of England and Wales.                  Among the important
results of these surveys was a series          of observations on the Tides
around the British Islands, which formed the subject of a paper read
                                                         ‘
before the Royal Society, and published in the             Philosophical Trans
actions ;’ and the estimation         of Captain Beechey’s labours by the
Society may be judged of by the fact, that the Council requested the
Admiralty to afford him the means of continuing his inquiries.
   For some years subsequently, Captain Beechey was chie<U+FB02>y em
ployed in continuing these services, and in reporting to Government
on harbours,     stations for marine postal communication,            and other
public undertakings       of   a  like description.     In  1848 and 1849 he
attended Her Majesty in her visits to Scotland and Ireland, in charge
of the pilotage      of the Royal Squadron          ;  and     in 1851   he was
appointed Aide-de-camp         to the Queen.
   The Government having resolved to establish the Marine Depart
ment of the Board of Trade, Captain Beechey was chosen to assist
in its organization, and in this important and very onerous duty, to
which he was appointed in 1850, he laboured incessantly, day and
night, to the great detriment of his health.          In 1853 he was selected
to take part in the     “ Meteorological      Conference” held at Brussels,
for the purpose of devising a great scheme of international co-opera
tion in obtaining    meteorological observations at sea, which was to be
promoted and superintended on the part of England, by the Marine
Department      of the Board of Trade.            In   the following year he
obtained his Flag as Rear-Admiral on the active list.
   Admiral Beechey had long been Fellow of the Astronomical,                Geo
logical,  and Geographical         Societies, and had contributed       valuable
communications      to these bodies.         He was   elected into the Royal
Society in 1824, and in 1854 was         nominated aVice-President;       at the
time   of his  decease    he was President       of the Royal Geographical
Society.
   A  short time before Admiral Beechey’s            acceptance of the Presi
 dency of the Geographical        Society, he was attacked by severe illness,

                                     287
the consequence of 'hardships endured and bodily and mental powers
overstrained, in the cause of science and of that profession to which      I I.
through life he was     so earnestly devoted.    The Chair  was, however,
left vacant in the hope of his speedy recovery, and on this hope being          —
to some extent    ful<U+FB01>lled, he was unanimously elected, and entered   with
his usual zeal on the duties of that honourable position.        This was
in 1855    : in May of the following year he delivered his Presidential
Address at the Anniversary Meeting of the Society, and this was his
last   conspicuous    public duty.     His health, notwithstanding     his
partial recovery,   was permanently     broken, and a renewed attack of
illness terminated his useful life on the 29th of November,       1856, in
the sixty-<U+FB01>rst year of his age.

    It may be long before we are called on to record public services of
nearly   half  a century more ably, earnestly, and usefully     performed
than those of Admiral Beechey.          On his private virtues this is not
the occasion to expatiate;     it will su<U+FB01>ice here to  say that he was a
sincere Christian,    and a gentleman in the best sense of the term,
and that through life he was supported         by a <U+FB01>rm trust in Provi
                                                                                I

    Admiral Beechey married, in 1828, Charlotte, youngest daughter
 of Colonel Stapleton, of Thorpe Lee, Surrey, and has left several
 children.

 Professor Powell, the best thanks       of the Society were voted to the

       Received October 15, 1856.
                                       (Abstract.)
  The specimens of sea-water experimented upon were collected
during the voyage of Her Majesty’s Ship ‘Adventure,’ commencing at
Rio   de    Janeiro, and from thence in succession       to St. Catharine’s,   the
River Plate, round the Falkland Islands to Cape Horn, and thence to
Valparaiso     ;   and during the ship’s return from Valparaiso,        through
the Strait of Magalhaens          to the River Plate and Rio de Janeiro.
The    series was then completed         by the voyage to England.
   From the author’s observations it may be inferred that the density
of the water of the Ocean        is,
                            very nearly, identical in all parts of the
Atlantic between 40° North and 40° South latitude, the exceptions
being due to local causes. Dry winds, by increasing the effect of
evaporation, would naturally increase the density of the surface water,

whilst on the other hand, winds charged with vapour would have but
little effect ; and a heavy fall of rain, particularly in equatorial parts
of the Ocean, where the       sea is so little disturbed, would very sensibly
diminish it. It is also very sensibly less in the vicinity of the coast,
particularly when the latter is of a shoal character, as is the case
between the River Plate and the Strait of Magalhaens, where the
whole extent is fronted by a bank having from 30 to 50 fathoms of
water.
    The   mean speci<U+FB01>c    gravity of the water of the South Paci<U+FB01>c, con
 tained between the parallels of 10° and 40°, is 1026-48, and between
 40° and 60° it is 1026'l3.
    The results obtained by the author          are then compared    with the
 following, viz.-—

 II. “On      the Existence of Silver in Sea-water.”         By FREDERICK

        Esq.,  D.C.L., F.R.S. &c.          Received October 23, 1856.
     In  a  paper <U+FB01>rst published       by    MM. Malaguti, Durocher,       and

and translated in the Quarterly Journal of the Chem. Soc., vol. iii.
p. 69, there is an account of the detection and estimation of silver in
sea-water.    The authors suspected the existence of the metal from
the extensive diifusionof silver in the mineral kingdom, the conversion
of its sulphide into chloride by the prolonged action of soluble bodies
containing chlorine, and the solubility of chloride of silver in chloride
of sodium.        The method pursued               was     by passing sulphuretted
hydrogen   through large quantities of water, and also by fusing

  As a solution of chloride of silver in chloride of sodium               is instantly
decomposed by metallic copper, chloride of copper being formed and
silver precipitated,   it appeared tohighly probable that the copper
                                          me
and the yellow metal used in sheathing the bulls of vessels, must,
after long exposure to sea-water, contain more silver than they did
before having been exposed to its action, by decomposing                      chloride
of silver in their   passage through the sea, and depositing the metal on
their surfaces.      A large   vessel, the
                                             ‘
                                                 Ana Guimaraens,’ now under the
Chilian   <U+FB01>ag,'was hauled down      in the Bay of Herradura, near Coquimbo,
for the purpose of being repaired, and the captain obligingly furnished
me with a few ounces of the yellow metal from the bottom of the vessel.
The investigation      was interesting,      as the metal had been on for more
than seven years (an unusually long period), and the ship had been
trading up and down the Paci<U+FB01>c Ocean all that time. The metal,
upon examination, was found to be exceedingly brittle, and could be
broken between the <U+FB01>ngers with great               ease.    5000 grs. were dissolved
in pure nitric acid and the solution diluted ; a few drops of hydro
chloric acid were added, and the precipitate allowed to -subside for
three days.    A large    quantity of white insoluble matter had collected
by that time      at the bottom         of the beaker.        This was <U+FB01>ltered off,
dried, and fused with 100 grs. pure litharge and suitable proportions
of bitartrate of potash and carbonate of              soda, the ashes     of the <U+FB01>lter
also being added.        The resulting       of lead was subsequently
                                                 button
cupelled, and yielded 2'01 grs. silver, or l lb. 1 oz. 2 dwts. 15 grs.
troy per ton. This very large quantity could hardly be supposed to
have existed in the original metal, as the value of the silver would be
well worth the extraction.         It   is to be regretted that the captain had
                                                                  2   A   2

he was repairing        the vessel yielded          only   0 oz. 18 dwts. to the ton.
I   was enabled by the courtesy               of the captain of the ‘Nina,’ a brig
which had just arrived in the Paci<U+FB01>c from England, to obtain more
satisfactory information.             He     gave   me    a piece   of Muntz’s      yellow
metal from his cabin, from the same lot with which the brig                            was
sheathed, but which had never been in contact with salt water;                         and
also a small portion from the hull of the ship after it had been on
nearly three years.         The experiments          were performed as before,         and
the results were very striking.

    Many other specimens were examined of metals from the bottoms
of ships, and of pieces which are always kept on board in case of
need, and      it was invariably          found that the former contained more
silver than the latter.          For instance,        a piece from the      hull of the
‘Bergmann’        gave   5   ozs. 16 dwts. 18 grs. per ton, while             that from
the cabin yielded 4 ozs.         6   dwts. 12 grs.         200 grs. from a piece from
the hull of the ‘Parga’ gave ‘O72 gr., and a piece of fresh metal
‘O50;      while  from    the ‘Grasmere,’           only coppered      a few months,
610 grs. from the hull gave ‘O75 and from the cabin '072,—a very
                                                                              '
slight difference indeed.
    It will  be observed that the amount            of silver in the  above specimens
of fresh metal is very high, and it is probable that most of these are
merely the re-rolling of masses of metal melted down from old
sheathing, and have derived the greater part of their silver from the
sea on former occasions.           It   is well known that      the copper used in the
manufacture of yellow metal is very pure, containing 2 or 3 dwts. of
silver per ton, frequently not so much, and silver is very seldom asso
ciated with the other constituent, zinc.                  In order to arrive at more
certain results, however,          I   have granulated        some very pure       copper,
reserving      some   in    a glass        stoppered    bottle,   and  suspended          the
remainder (about 10 ounces) in a wooden box perforated on all sides,
a few feet under the surface of the Paci<U+FB01>c Ocean.                      When occasion

                                       295
 offers,   the box is towed by a line at the stern of a vessel which is
 trading up and down the coast of Chili.               It is almost too soon to
 expect any decisive results at present, but in a few months             I hope
 to be enabled to send both the original          copper, and that which has
 been exposed to the action      of the sea.

         Measures of the Earth’s Mean               Density.”     By Captain
         W. S. Jacoa, Director         of the Observatory at Madras.

        Received October 25, 1856.
    The result of the Pendulum        experiments in the Harton Colliery,
 undertaken    by the Astronomer       Royal in 1854, and detailed in his
paper presented to the Royal Society in January 1856, appears at
<U+FB01>rst sight rather startling, as adding to the already somewhat dis
crepant measures or estimates of the earth’s mean density one more
discordant than ever     ; so that we have now values ranging from          4'7
to nearly 6'6   ; a range, which, in the absence      of any su<U+FB02>icient ground
for selecting any one as     true to the exclusion of the rest, would seem
to deprive us of all con<U+FB01>dence in their correctness as measures,            and
leave them rather to be classed         as estimates      of a very rough    de
scription.
    But it will   be  my endeavour to show, that, while           none of the
methods employed are capable of giving strictly accurate results, the
Cavendish experiment is the one which may be relied on as giving a
good approximation      to the   truth, within limits of error (when con
ducted with proper precaution) far less than those to which either of
the other methods     are liable.
    The three principal methods which have been tried are,—lst, the
Schehallien or Huttonian, which consists in comparing the total
attraction of the earth with that of         a mountain mass, by measuring
astronomically    the inclination of the normals at a given distance in
the meridian-plane     on each side of the mass      ;  and then inferring the
attraction of the mass from the         di<U+FB02>'erence   of this inclination from
what it would     be on an exact spheroid      ;  2nd, the Cavendish experi

                                                  296
ment, in which the earth’s total attraction is compared, by means of
the torsion-balance, with that of a small mass of known dense material                        ;
and 3rd, the pendulum,              or       Air;/s experiment, in which the total
attraction is compared with that at some distance below the surface,
or by means of diferencea, with that of the outer spheroidal shell,
whose       density    may be       supposed,           approximately    at   least,    to be
known.
  Now none of these methods give the mean density                              as a direct
result; for the result obtained, the earth’s total attraction,                  is: g X the
sum of (all the particles divided respectively by the squares of their
distances) instead of g X (the total mass divided by the square of the
radius or mean distance) : and to assume the equality of these, is to
assume      the earth to be a sphere, and to have its matter arranged in
concentric shells or layers of equal density throughout                        each      layer,
both of which we know to be untrue.                        Mr. Airy has indeed shown
that, in the case of his experiment,                    it is su<U+FB02>icient if    we know, as
regards the upper shell, the form and density of that portion which
is in the immediate neighbourhood                   of the place of observation, with
out attending to irregularities               of distant parts; but he has not shown
that variations of density below and near to his lowest station would
not sensibly vitiate his results.
   In      order to show the nature and amount                    of error that might
thus be introduced, let         AB           be

then it is evident that on the
                                                                                                  Jig
supposition       of   a uniform       den
sity throughout,        the attraction
of the small sphere            on the
point   A   would be just half of
the total attraction of the earth,
although       its      mass       would
amount to but %; and            if         this
small sphere were to have its
density     doubled,     the total at-                             B
traction      would be increased by one-half, while the mean                           density

    Now it is quite true that                  we need not fear any great deviation               of
 density extending through so large a portion                            of the earth, for that        ,   i
 would displace the centre of gra
 vity to a sensible extent, which                                          Fig. 2.
 would become perceptible                     in the

 measurements of latitude;                    but a
local    deviation     might produce                a

 error; thus       if AC’

without producing any sensible e<U+FB01>'ect on the true mean density, or
on the position of the centre of gravity, since the bulk of AC’ would
be only about
               50001000
                        of that of the earth. Now we know little or
nothing of the density of the matter                     a   few miles below the surface;
only we are sure, from the discordant lengths of the pendulum in
different latitudes, and even in the same latitude under different
meridians, that the local deviations                     are indeed sensible, yet            of   so
small an amount as hardly to affect this inquiry, and that the error
from this    cause can never even approach                   1   per mille.         The Cavendish
experiment may therefore be considered as practically free from error
of this kind; and      as regards errors arising from manipulation                       or instru
mental    causes,     their probable amount may                       be    determined in the
ordinary way from the variation of the results. But the Cavendish,              if
why may not the Huttonian experiment equally be considered free
from error?         Because in the former we are dealing with disturbing
masses whose amount             is   exactly known, whereas in the latter, while
we may approximately             measure the mass of the mountain above the
surface, we do not know how much                          may be added or abstracted

a detached mass resting upon the general surface ;                                it will almost            cer

assumed above (1'4), though possible,                              is   not likely   ;   the same e<U+FB02>'ect

                                          299
might    be produced      by a smaller rate of change through a greater
space; thus an addition           of about 0'5 to the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of              a
sphere of    1  mile in diameter, or of 0'33 to one of 10 miles diameter,
would have nearly the same effect, and it cannot be contended that
these are improbably        large.
    Should the experiment        ever be repeated,      it would  be desirable to
swing the pendulum           at one (at least) intermediate station between
the top and bottom of the shaft, by which means any error of this
kind might      be approximately      eliminated.      In the  mean time     I  think
there are hardly suf<U+FB01>cient grounds for impugning               the correctness of
the value of       E (5'67) deduced by the late Francis Baily from his
carefully conducted repetition of the Cavendish experiment.
IV. “On          Practical     Methods       for  rapid     Signalling      by     the
        Electric Telegraph.”             By Prof.       W. THOMSON,          F.R.S.
        Received November [4, 1856.
    I am at present engaged         in working out various practical applica
 tions of the formulae communicated some time ago in a short article
 on the “Theory of the Electric Telegraph” (Proceedings,                    May 17,
 1855),     and  I  hope to be     able very soon to lay the results in full
 before the Royal Society.           In the mean time,       as the project      of  an
 Atlantic Telegraph is       at this moment exciting much interest,            I  shall
 explain shortly a telegraphic system to which, in the course of this
 investigation,     I have been led, as likely to give nearly the same
 rapidity of utterance by          a submarine      one-wire    cable of ordinary
 lateral dimensions between Ireland and Newfoundland,                 as is  attained
  on short air or submarine lines by telegraphic systems in actual use.
     Every system of working the electric telegraph must comprehend
  (1) a plan of operating at one extremity, (2) a plan of observing at
  the other, and     (3)  a code   of letter-signals.     These three parts of the
  system which      I propose will be explained in order,—I. for long sub
  marine lines, and     II.  for air or short submarine lines.
         I.  Proposed telegraphic        system  for  long submarine lines.
     1.  Plan of operating.—This consists in applying              a regulated gal

                                                300
     vanic battery        to give, during a limited time, a de<U+FB01>nite variation of
     electric potential      determined by theory, so as to ful<U+FB01>l the condition
     of producing an electric effect at the other extremity, which, after
     <U+FB01>rst becoming sensible, rises very rapidly to a maximum, then sinks
     as rapidly till it becomes again, and continues, insensible.
          The principle     followed   is that pointed out by Fourier, by which
    we see, that, when the wire is left           with both ends uninsulated                         after
    any electrical operations whatever have been performed upon                                  it,   the
    distribution of electric potential through   will very quickly be
                                                                    it
    reduced to   harmonic law, with an amplitude falling in equal pro
                      a
    portions during equal intervals            of time.           Unless the electric opera
    tions ful<U+FB01>l     a   certain condition, this ulterior distribution                  is   according
    to the simple harmonic law (that      proportional to the sine of the
                                                 is,   is
    distance from either extremity, the whole length being reckoned as
            The condition which propose to ful<U+FB01>l that the coe<U+FB02>icient     is,
    180°).                                I
    of the simple harmonic term in the expression for the electrical
-                         Then, according to Fourier, the distribution
    potential shall vanish.
    will very much more quickly wear into one following   double har                 a
    monic law (that is, the sine of the distance from one extremity, the
    whole length being reckoned as 360°).     In this state of electri<U+FB01>ca
    tion the two halves of the wire on each side of its middle point,
    being symmetrically          and oppositely         electri<U+FB01>ed, will discharge into
    one another, as well        as into the earth at              their remote extremities;
    each will be like       a   single wire of half-length,              with the simple har
    monic distribution; and the wire will, on the whole, be discharged
    as fast as    a   wire of half the length, or four times as fast as                     a   wire    of
    the whole length, after an ordinary                  electri<U+FB01>cation.             There      is   con
                                                                                                             sgk
    siderable latitude as to the mode of operating so as to ful<U+FB01>l this con
    dition, but the theoretical investigation               is   readily available for <U+FB01>nding
    the best way of ful<U+FB01>lling       it    in practice.       The result,        as
                                                                                 I       have tested
    by actual calculation of the electric pulse at the remote end,     most                   is
    satisfactory.    The calculations, and curves exhibiting the electric
    pulse in    variety of cases, will,
                a                       trust, very soon be laid before the
                                             I
    Royal Society.
       The time and law of operations being once <U+FB01>xed upon,      mecha                    a
    nical contrivance of the simplest kind will give the means of direct
    ing   a   regulated galvanic battery to perform               it   with    exactness,       and to
    any stated degree         (positive     or negative) of strength.                     Complete

                                         301
plans   of all details    I  have ready to describe when wanted, and shall
very soon be able to state exactly the battery power required for a
cable   of stated dimensions.
   2. Plan of observation for receiving a           message.-—-The   instrument
which    I propose    is Helmholtz’s galvanometer, with or without modi
<U+FB01>cation.      The time of vibration        of the suspended magnet, and the
e<U+FB02>iciency of the copper damper, will be so arranged, that during the
electric pulse the suspended magnet will turn from its position of
equilibrium into      a position   of maximum de<U+FB02>ection, and will fall back
to rest in its position        of equilibrium.    The possibility of ful<U+FB01>lling
these conditions is obvious from the form of the curve I have found
to represent the electric pulse.          The observer will watch through a
telescope the image of a scale        re<U+FB02>ected from the polished side of the
magnet, or from a small mirror carried by the magnet, and he will
note the letter or number which each maximum de<U+FB02>ection brings into
the middle     of his <U+FB01>eld of view.
   3. Code of letter-ez'gnals.—The           most obvious way of completing
a telegraphic     system on the plans which         have been described, is to    _
have the twenty-six letters of the alphabet written             on the scale of
which the image in the suspended mirror is observed, and to arrange
thirteen positive and thirteen negative strengths of electric operation,
which will give de<U+FB02>ections, positive or negative, bringing one or other
of these letters on the re<U+FB02>ected scale into the centre of the <U+FB01>eld of
view.     But it would be bad economy to give the simple signals to
rare letters, and to require double or triple signals for double and
triple combinations of frequent occurrence.              Besides, by the plans
which have formed, it will, I believe, be easy to make much more
         I
than     thirteen    different    positive   and  thirteen   different   negative
strengths of electric operation, giving unmistakeably di<U+FB02>'erent degrees
of de<U+FB02>ection ; and if so, then many of the most frequent double and triple
combinations,      as well as    all the twenty-six letters of the alphabet
singly,   might    be   made by simple signals.         But it is also possible
(although     I believe    highly improbable),     that in practice only three
or four, or some number less than thirteen, of unmistakeably di<U+FB01>erent
de<U+FB02>ections could be produced in the galvanometer at one end by
electric operations performed on the other extremity.                 If  so, the
whole twenty-six        letters could not each have a simple signal, and
double signals would have to be chosen for the less frequent letters.

                                      302
Experience      must show what number           of perfectly  distinct simple
signals can be made, and       I have scarcely a doubt but that it will be
much more than twenty-six.           Then it will   be easy to invent a  letter
code which       will use  these signals with the best economy for the
 language in which the message         is to be delivered.       Towards   this
 object  I have commenced collecting         statistics showing   the relative
 frequency with which the different simple letters, and various com
 binations of simple letters, occur in the English language, and       I must
 soon have information      enough to guide in choosing the best code for
 a given number of simple signals.
    The investigation leading to a measurement of the elcctro-mag
 netic unit of electricity in terms of the electro-static unit, published
 since the commencement          of the present year by Kohlrausch and
 Weber, has given all that is required to deduce from Weber’s own
 previous experiments the measurement of the electric conductivity           of
 copper wire in terms of the proper kind of unit for the telegraph
 problem.      The data required for estimating the rapidity of action in
 a  submarine wire of stated dimensions would be completed by a
 determination     of the speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacity of gutta percha, or        ~
 better still, a direct experiment on the electro-static capacity of a yard
 or two cut from the cable itself.       I  have estimated the retardations
 of various electric pulses, and the practicable rate of transmitting
messages by cables 2400 miles long, and of certain ordinary lateral
dimensions, on the assumption that the speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacity            of
gutta-peroha, measured as Faraday did that of sulphur, shell-lac, &c.,
is 2, from which it probably does not differ much.           These estimates
have been published       elsewhere (Athenaeum,       Oct. 1856), and I shall
                          I
                                                                                  IL
not repeat them until        can along with them give a table of estimates
for cables of various dimensions, with the uncertainty as to the
physical property of gutta-percha        either done away with by experi
ment, or taken strictly into account.
   II.  Plan for rapid sel/'-recording signals by air wires and short
                              submarine cables.
    The consideration of the preceding plans has led me to think of a
system of working air lines, and short submarine lines, by which
great rapidity of utterance, considerably greater         I believe than any
hitherto   practised, may be attained.       I have no doubt but that on

                                             303
        this system <U+FB01>ve  or six distinct letters per second, or sixty words per
       minute,   may be readily delivered through        air lines and submarine      .
       lines up to 100   miles, or perhaps even considerably more, of length,
       and recorded    by a self-acting apparatus, which     I  shall describe in a
       communication    I hope to make to the Royal Society before itsnext
       meeting.
            “ On Practical Methods for
      V.                                     Rapid Signalling by the Electric
             Telegraph.”        (Second    communication.)          By Prof.     W.
             THOMSON,     F.R.S.      Received December 11, 1856.
1          I. Further remarks     on proposed method for great distances.
         Since my former communication on this subject           I have  worked out
     the determination     of operations performed     at one extremity    of a sub
     marine wire, so adjusted, that when the other extremity is kept cou
     stantly uninsulated,      the subsidence of the electricity        in the wire
     shall follow the triple harmonic law (that is to say, the electrical
    potential shall ultimately vary along the wire in proportion to the
    sine   of the distance from either end, one-third of the length of the wire
    being taken as 180°).        The condensation of the electrical pulse at the
    receiving extremity, due to such operations, is of course considerably
   greater than that which is obtained from operations leading only to
   the double harmonic as described in my last communication;                    but
   experience will be necessary         to test whether or not the precision of
   adjustment in the operations required to obtain the advantages which
   the theory indicates, can be attained in practice when so high a
   degree of condensation is aimed at. The theory shows exactly what
  amount and duration of residual charge in the wire would result
  from stated deviations from perfect accuracy in the adjustments of
  the operations;         but it cannot be known for certain, without actual
  trial, within what limit such deviations can be kept in practice.
  From Weber’s experiments on the electric conductivity of copper,
  and from measurements which I have made on specimens of the
  cable now in process of manufacture for the Atlantic telegraph,                   I
  think       it highly probable that, with     an alphabet of twenty letters, one
  letter could be delivered every two seconds between Newfoundland
“@--1
  and Ireland (which would give, without any condensed code, six

                                        304
                                                   D
 words per minute) on the general plan which             I  explained in my last
 communication;       and that no higher battery power than from 150 to
 200 small cells of Danie1l’s (perhaps even considerably              less) would
 be required.     Whether or not this system may ultimately be found
 preferable to the very simple and undoubtedly            practicable method of
 telegraphing invented by       Mr. Wildman Whitehouse, can scarcely            be
 decided until one or both methods shall have been tested on a cable
 of the dimensions of the Atlantic        cable,  either actually submerged or
 placed in perfectly similar inductive circumstances.
   II. Method for telegraphing through submarine or subterranean
                  lines  of not more than 500 miles length.
    The plan which      I have   proposed to describe for rapid signalling
 through shorter wires, has         one  characteristic    in common with the
 plan  I have already suggested for the Atlantic telegraph              ; namely,
 that of using different strengths of current for different signals.
    But in lines of less than 500 miles, condensed pulses, such as have
been described, may be made to follow one another more rapidly
than to admit of being read off by an observer watching the image               of
a scale  in   a  suspended mirror; and          a new plan     of receiving and
recording the indications becomes necessary.
    Of various plans which         I  have considered, the following        seems
most likely to prove convenient in practice.
    Several small steel     magnets (perhaps         each about half an inch
long) are suspended horizontally by <U+FB01>ne threads or wires at di<U+FB02>"erent
positions in the neighbourhood of a coil of which one end is con
nected with the line wire and the other with the earth.                   Each of
these magnets is held in a position             de<U+FB02>ected from      the magnetic
meridian by two stops on which its ends press;              and two other small
stops of platinum wire         are   arranged to prevent       it from turning
through more than         a very small     angle when actuated by any de
<U+FB02>ecting force making        it leave the <U+FB01>rst position.         When a current
passing through the coil produces this effect on any one of these
magnets,   it immediately strikes the last-mentioned               stops, and so
completes a circuit through a local battery and makes a mark on pre
pared electro-chemical       paper.     For each suspended magnet there is
a separate   style, but of course one battery is suf<U+FB01>cient for the whole

                                    305
printing process.     One set of the different suspended magnets are so
adjusted, that a current in one direction of any strength falling short       I
of  a certain  limit makes only one of them move ; that a current in
the same direction, of strength exceeding this limit but falling short
of another limit, moves another also of the suspended magnets ; and
so on  for a succession  of di<U+FB01>'erent limits of strength of current in one
direction.    The remaining set of suspended magnets are adjusted to
move with      di<U+FB02>'erent strengths   of current in the other      direction
through the coil.       Without experience it is impossible to say how
many gradations      of strength could    be conveniently  arranged to be
thus distinguished     unmistakeably.     I have no doubt, however, that
very moderate applications      of electric resources would give at least
three different strengths of current in each direction, which could
with   ease and certainty be distinguished    from one another by the test
 which the suspended magnets afford. Thus, a signal of six varieties
 —one letter of an alphabet of six—could be recorded by almost in
 stantaneous movements of six suspended magnets, making one, two
 or three marks by one set of three styles, or one, two or three marks
 by another set of three styles, placed all six beside one another,
 pressing on a slip of electro-chemical paper drawn by clockwork,         as
 in the Morse instrument.
    In  subterranean or submarine lines of less than 100 miles length,
 it would  be easy, by means of simple battery applications, followed by
 connexions with the earth, or by means of simple electro-magnetic
 impulses at one end of the wire, to give ten or twelve of such signals
 per second without any confusion of utterance at the other end. The
 confusion  of utterance which would      be experienced  in working thus
 through longer lines would     be easily done away with, in any length
 up to 500 miles, by following up each battery application           with   a
 reverse application for a shorter time, or by following up each electro
 magnetic impulse by a weaker reverse impulse, so as approximately
 to ful<U+FB01>l the condition (described in my former communication), of re
 ducing the subsidence of the electri<U+FB01>cation in the wire to the double
 harmonic form.       It would,  I believe, be readily practicable  to send
 distinctly <U+FB01>ve or six such signals per second (each a distinct letter of
 an alphabet of six) through a wire of 500 miles length in a submarine
  cable of ordinary dimensions.      To perform the electrical operations
  required for sending   a message   on this system, mechanism might be

                                               306
     had recourse to, and, by the'use of perforated slips, as in Bain’s and
     other systems, it would be easy to work from twelve to twenty of the
     six-fold varied signals per second through lines of                  less than 100 miles
     length.     Operating by the hand         is,   however, I      believe, generally pre
     ferred .for ordinary telegraphing        ;   and no such speed as the last-men
     tioned could be attained even by              skilful operator working with

     could, however,       I    believe, be delivered per second by the two hands
     working on      a          with twelve keys (perhaps like those of
                           key-board                                                           a
     pianoforte), provided the keys are so arranged as to ful<U+FB01>l the follow
     ing conditions        :-
        (1) That by simply striking once any one of        <U+FB01>rst set of six of
                                                                      a
     the keys, an electric operation of one or other of the six varieties shall
     be made     twice, the second time commencing                   at   a   de<U+FB01>nite interval
     (perhaps ilqth of     second) later than the <U+FB01>rst.
                                a
       (2)     That by striking one or other of the remaining                        six keys at
    the same time, or very nearly at the same time,                       as one     of the <U+FB01>rst
    set, the second operation  of the double electric signal will be that
    corresponding to the key of the second set which       struck, instead is
    of being   mere repetition
                a              of the operation corresponding to the key
    of the <U+FB01>rst     set.
       It   would certainly be easy to make              a    key-board         to ful<U+FB01>l these
    conditions with the aid of some clockwork                power.       Then by arranging
    the thirty-six permutations and doubles of the six simple signals to
    represent an alphabet of thirty-six letters and signs, an experienced
    operator would have to direct his mind to only six different letters
    per second,      while executing them by six double operations with his
    <U+FB01>ngers.     That   it   would    be possible to   work     by   hand at this rate there
    can be no doubt, when we consider the marvels of rapid execution so
    commonly attained by practice on the pianoforte; and                        it   appears not
    improbable      that in regular       telegraphic work, practised operators                of
    ordinary  skill could perform from four to six letters with ease per
    second, or from forty to sixty words per minute, on lines of not more
    than 100 miles length.           The six signals per      second, which,          according
    to the preceding            estimate, could be distinctly conveyed by                a   sub
    merged wire of 500 miles in length,               could of course be easily per
formed by the hand, with the aid of                      a   key-board        and clockwork
    power adapted to make the double operations for giving rapid sub

sidence     of electricity in the wire when any one key                                is touched, and
 to let the different strengths             of current, in           one direction         or the other,
be produced by the different keys.                        Thus without          a condensed code,
thirty words per minute could be telegraphed through subterranean
or submarine lines of 500 miles; and from thirty to <U+FB01>fty or sixty
words per minute through such lines, of lengths of from 500 miles to
 100 miles.
   The rate of from <U+FB01>fty to sixty words per minute could be attained
through almost any length of air line, were it not for the defects of
insulation to which such lines are exposed.                               If   the imperfection of
the insulation remained constant, or only varied slowly from day to
day with the humidity of the atmosphere, the method                                        I   have indi
cated     might probably, with suitable adjustments, be made successful;
and   I   think it possible that it may be found to answer for air lines of
hundreds of miles’ length.                  But in        a short air line, the strengths                of
the currents      received, at one extremity,                       from graduated operations
performed at the other, might suddenly, in the middle of a message,
become so much changed as to throw                             all the indications into con
fusion, in consequence of a shower of rain, or a trickling of water
along a spider’     s   web.

  VII.   “ A Memoir on Curves of the Third Order.”                          By ARTHUR
           CAYLEY, Esq., F.R.S.                 Received Oct. 30, 1856.
                                      (Abstract.)
     A curve of the third order, or cubic curve, is the locus represented
 by an equation such as        U=(*Ia',          3/,   z)3=O ; and it appears by my
  “ Third Memoir on Quantics,”                       it is proper to consider, in con
                                            that
 nexion with the curve of the third order, U=0, and its Hessian
  HU=0 (which          is also a curve of the third order),                  two curves
 of the third class, viz. the curves represented by the equations
 PU=0      and  QU=0.         These equations,             I  say, represent curves     of
 the third class;      in fact,   PU     and    QU      are  contravariants of U, and
 therefore, when the variables x, y, z                 of U    are considered as point
 coordinates, the variables        £, 1;, Z  of PU, QU must           be considered as
 line coordinates, and the curves will be curves of the third class.                     I
 propose (in analogy with the form of the word Hessian) to call the
 two curves in question the Pippian and Quippian respectively.                          A
geometrical    de<U+FB01>nition of the Pippian was readily found; the curve
is in fact Steine1"s curve R0 mentioned in the memoir “Allgemeine
Eigenschaften der algebraischen Curven,” Crelle, t. xlvii. pp. 1-6,
in the particular     case  of a basis-curve          of the third order; and      I also
found that the Pippian might be considered as occurring                        implicitly
in my “Mémoire sur les Courbes du Troisieme Ordre,” Liouville,
t. ix. p. 285, and “ Nouvelles Remarques sur les Courbes du
Troisieme Ordre,” Liouv. t. x. p. 102.                    As regards the Quippian,      I

                                         311
     have not succeeded    in obtaining a satisfactory geometrical de<U+FB01>nition;
     but the search after it led to a variety of theorems, relating chie<U+FB02>y
     to the <U+FB01>rst-mentioned curve, and the results of the investigation are
    contained in the present memoir.          Some of these results are due to
     Mr. Salmon, with whom        I  was  in correspondence on the subject.
    The character of the results makes it di<U+FB02>icult to develope them in a
    systematic order; but the results are given in such connexion one
    with another,    as I have been able to present them in.           Considering
    the object of the memoir to be the establishment           of  a distinct   geo
    metrical    theory of the Pippian, the leading results         will   be  found
    summed up in the nine de<U+FB01>nitions           or modes of generation of the
    Pippian, given in the concluding number.              In the course ot' the
    memoir I give some further developments relating to the theory in
    the memoirs in Liouville above       referred to, showing       its relation to
    the Pippian, and the analogy with theorems of Hesse in relation to
    the Hessian.
   VIII. “On        the Ic-partitions of    a  Polygon and Polyace.”              By
          the    Rev.   T. P. Kmxmaw,            M.A.       Communicated          by
          Aarnna CAYLEY, Esq.            Received November 13, 1856.
                                    (Abstract.)
       The problem relating      to the polyace is the reciprocal           of that
   relating   to the polygon, and is not separately discussed.              By the
   /c-partitions of a polygon, the author means        the number of ways in
  which the polygon can         be divided   by   (k—l)    diagonals, no one of
  which crosses another;         two ways being       different   only when no
  cyclical permutation      or reversion of the numbers at the angles of
  the polygon      can make them alike:       it is assumed that the polygon
  is of the ordinary convex form, so that all the diagonals lie within
  its area.    The author remarks, that the enumeration of the partitions
  of the polygon and polyace is indispensable in the theory of polyedra,
  and that in his former memoir       “ On the Enumeration of :c~edra having
- Triedral Summits and        an  (a:—1)-gonal Base,” Phil. Trans. 1856,
  p. 399, he has, in fact, investigated the (1-—2)-partitions          of the 13-ace

                                                  312
or r-gon   ; so    that the present memoir may be considered as a com
pletion, or rather an extension and completion,                of the investigations
in his former memoir.                  The number of distinctions to be made in the
problem of the present memoir is very great; thus, a partition of the
polygon      may be either reversible or irreversible; and                            if   reversible,
then the axis of reversion may be either agonal, monogonal, or dia
gonal,'that     is,    it   may pass through no angle, one angle only, or two
angles of the polygon             ;   and in the last case        it   may be either drawn or
undrawn.      Again, there may be                 a    single axis or       a    greater number of
axes   of reversion in the case of
                            :                      m       such axes, the partition         is    said to
be m-ly reversible;             and in like manner an irreversible partition                           may
consist of    a   single irreversible sequence                   of con<U+FB01>gurations, or             it   may
contain such sequence                 m   times repeated,        it   is   then said to be m-ly
irreversible.          In   consequence         of this multiplicity of distinctions,                  the
author’s <U+FB01>nal results are necessarily very complicated, and cannot be
exhibited in an abstract;                 they appear, however, to contain                    a     com

       F.R.S.           Received October 30, 1856.

     The extinct         species       of large terrestrial           Sloth,      indicated       by the
above name, was              <U+FB01>rst     made known by portions                of its fossil skeleton
having     been        discovered         by   Charles Darwin, Esq.,             F.R.S.,     at    Punta
Alta, Northern Patagonia.                       These portions         were       described by the

                                     313
                                     ‘
author in the Appendix to the          Natural History of the Voyage of
H.M.S. Beagle.’
    The subsequent acquisition by the British Museum of the collec
tion of Fossil Mammalia brought from Buenos Ayres by M. Bravard,
has given further evidence of the generic distinction          of the Sceli
dothere, and has supplied important characters of the osseous system,
and especially of the skull, which the fragments from the hard con
solidated gravel of Punta Alta did not afford.
    The best portion  of the cranium from that locality wanted the facial
part anterior to the orbit, and the greater part of the upper walls;
su<U+FB01>icient however remained to indicate the peculiar character of its
slender   proportions,   and hence Professor Owen has been            led to
select the name leptocephalum for the species, which is undoubtedly
new.                                    ,
   The aptness of the epithet ‘slender-headed’ is proved by the author’s
researches to be greater than could have been surmised             from the
original fossil; for the entire skull, now in the British Museum,
exhibits a curious and very peculiar prolongation of the upper and
lower jaws, and a slenderness of the parts produced         anterior  to the
dental series, unique in the leaf-eating section of the order Bruta, and
o<U+FB01>'ering a very interesting approximation       to the peculiar proportions
of the skull in the Ant-eaters.
    The original fossils from Patagonia indicated that they belonged to
an individual of immature age: the difference of size between them
and the corresponding parts in the British Museum, depends on the
latter having belonged to full-grown individuals : the slight difference
 in the shape of the anterior molars seems in like manner to be due
 to such an amount of change as might take place in the progress           of
 growth of a tooth with a constantly renewable pulp.        Professor Owen
 <U+FB01>nds at least no good grounds for inferring a speci<U+FB01>c distinction        be
 tween the mature    if not old Scelidothere from Buenos Ayres, and the
 younger specimen from Patagonia.
    The author then proceeds to give a detailed anatomical account of
 the fossil bones in the British Museum, instituting a comparison
  between them and the bones of other large extinct animals, especially
 those of the Edentate order.
     The Scelidothcre   was a quadruped     of from  8 to 10 feet  in length,
  but not more than 4 feet high, and nearly as broad at the haunches;

                                    314
the thigh-bones      being extraordinarily    broad in proportion     to their
length.     The trunk gradually tapered forwards to the long and
slender head.      The fore-limbs had complete clavicles, and the rota
tory movements of the fore-arm.         All   the limbs were provided with
long and strong claws.     The animal had      a long and muscular tongue,
and it is probable that its food might have been of a more mixed
nature than in the Megatherium.        But it was more essentially related
to the Sloths than to the Ant-eaters.
   In  conclusion the author remarks, that as our knowledge             of the
great Megatherioid animals increases, the de<U+FB01>nition of their distinctive
characters demands more extended comparison of particulars.             Hence
in each   successive  attempt at a restoration of these truly remarkable
extinct   South American     quadrupeds,     there results a description of
details which might seem prolix and uncalled for, but which are
necessary for the proper development of the task of reproducing              a
specimen of an extinct species.
   Professor Owen adds, that he is indebted to an allotment from the
Government      Grant, placed at the disposal of the Royal Society for
scienti<U+FB01>c purposes, for the means of laying before the Society large
and admirably     executed drawings of the fossil bones described in his
paper.

   In a communication made to the Royal Society in the last Session,
“ On the
            Lunar-diurnal Magnetic Variation at Toronto,” the author
had stated
              that he could discover no trace of the lunar in<U+FB02>uence of
the decennial inequality which constitutes so marked a feature in the
solar magnetic variations.      He has    since read,  in  a memoir commu
nicated  to the Imperial Academy of Sciences        at Vienna, entitled  “ On
the In<U+FB02>uence of the Moon on the horizontal          component of the Mag

netic Force,” that    M. Kreil is of opinion that the observations of
different years at Milan and Prague, when combined,              would rather
favour the contrary inference, viz. that the decennial inequality exists
in the lunar as well as in the solar variations.       The author        was led
therefore to re-examine this question by the aid of the observations
of the Declination at the Hobarton Observatory, which he considers
to be remarkably well suited for the purpose, as they comprise eight
years   of consecutive hourly observation with unchanged instruments
and     a uniform   system of observation,      and number,      exclusive of
Sundays, Christmas-days,     and Good Fridays, and occasional but very.
rare omissions, no less than 51,998 observations.

I.   “ On the Function of the
                              Thyroid Body.” By PETER. MARTYN,
       Esq., M.D. L0nd., Surgeon R.N.     Communicated by Pro
        fessor HENFREY,    F.R.S.    Received November 13, 1856.
                               (Abstract.   )
   After referring to the form, situation, connexions and internal
structure of the thyroid body, its large supply of blood and its capa

                                            316
bility of sudden alterations of bulk; the author brie<U+FB02>y adverts to the
unsatisfactory explanations which have been offered as to its function,
and then proceeds to state his own views, as follows                      :—
     “The upper part of the trachea, the larynx, and the                      passage        of   the
fauces and mouth         constitute the organ of voice           ;    the two former are
the essential or voicing        part as mechanicians call             it,   that which pro
duces the tone.         The larynx and trachea-—taking                  a    share in other
functions and being associated by juxtaposition and attachment with
contiguous  organs--are always pervious and open for respiration;
lengthen and shorten, fall and rise with the (esophagus in deglutition,
and bend and turn with the universal motions of the head and neck.
     “ To admit of this great mobility and <U+FB02>exibility,                a     certain structure
is   necessary.   The larynx      is   a   triangular box enclosing the apparatus
of the    chordae vocales; its two cartilaginous           sides       or     alee,      diverging
from the front,         are not <U+FB01>xed but free at the back, being completed
by soft parts: the trachea         is   composed of   a   succession of incomplete
cartilaginous hoops or rings lying apart, the back and intervals being
made up and the tube completed by soft membrane.
     “Now the structure of         a       wind instrument,          such     as    that of the
human voice       is,   requires the very opposite properties.                      It    must be
rigid,   tense and in<U+FB02>exible.      The qualities of the tone will be in exact
proportion to     these     properties. How then         the soft, slack and
                                                            is
<U+FB02>exible vocal tube rendered thus rigid, tense and in<U+FB02>exible, and <U+FB01>t to
produce pure tone?      The muscles of the larynx, the thyro-hyoid and
sterno-thyroid,    merely raise or lower, or <U+FB01>x    in any position: not
                                                           it
lying on, or being parallel       to, but diverging from the vocal tube,                        they
cannot effect the object referred to.                It   appears to me that                      the
thyroid body     provided for this purpose.
                  is                         The act of uttering a
tone or of speaking stops the return of the blood from that organ,
distends and renders       it   tense, and from the nature             of its attachment
round the top of the trachea and on the free sides of the                             alae   of the
larynx, renders them <U+FB01>xed, <U+FB01>rm, and tense also.                       This effect          is   aided
by the aforesaid muscles, the thyroid body being interposed                                       and
giving    them more advantageous mechanical                   action.              This tension
may be in any degree, and on energetic speaking or singing, the                                    in
creased    size of the part and the fulness of the collateral veins may
be seen.      This  isthe reason of its large supply and free distribution
of blood.      An instance of the want of this tension in an instrument

                                          317
may be seen in the bagpipc, where the porte-vent is attached to the
chanter or voicing part by a <U+FB02>exible joint or by leather, and the tone
is in consequence squeaking and uncertain.
     “ Besides thus giving rigidity, <U+FB01>rmness and tension to the
                                                                            organ
of voice, the thyroid body also acts in another capacity—as a loader.
 In most musical instruments, loaders are used to render the vibra
tions slower and longer, and the tone in consequence fuller, louder
and deeper.        They compensate for want of        size and space, and give to
a small instrument,       or to a small vibrating or voicing part of an instru
 ment, the power and quality           of  a large one.     The human organ of
 voice is 8 inches long, and has the same power and better quality of
 tone than       the  instrument      that  most nearly     approaches   it,- the
 French horn, which is        9 feet,  or the “ vox humana” pipe of      a mode
 rate-sized organ, which is from 4 to 8 feet long.              This economy of
 size   in the human organ has always             been wondered at, but never,
 that    I  know,   explained.     Besides the thyroid body, another part,
 the structure      of which    I shall describe on another occasion, aids in
 this admirable economy.            The   nearer‘ mechanism     of human design
 approaches to perfection, the more it resembles similar structures in
 animal mechanics. The base of all stringed instruments and musical
 boxes is loaded:       in most wind instruments the voicing part          is thus
  loaded and strengthened, as in the organ pipe, horn, <U+FB02>ute, clarionet,
  &c.      The  bassoon,   which in its lower notes approaches the human
  voice, is uncertain and wheezy in tone for want of this provision.
      “ When the thyroid body is small and thin, the voice will be found
  to be small and shrill; when large, the tone will be full and sonorous ;
  when it is morbidly enlarged, the voice will be deeper and more
  base; and when very large,             as in   bronchocele, the voice will be
  smothered.
      “ The compass of the voice is in great part produced by the
   raising   and lowering of the larynx, the shortening          and lengthening
   of the vocal tube.        The thyroid body partakes of this motion, at
   the same    time <U+FB01>rmly <U+FB01>xing and rendering tense the parts in each
   position.     By its change of shape, bulk and density-<U+FB02>attening             and
   thinning when the larynx is raised, enlarging and bulging when it
   is lowered—it aids in giving the particular tone or pitch, high and
   acute in the <U+FB01>rst case, full and deep in the second; and, in like man
   ner, by its varying shape, bulk, density, and pressure, it takes a great

                                     318
 part in producing    the wonderful qualities of modulation and expres
 sion peculiar to the human voice.       In animated conversation, decla
 mation and singing, this may be seen.
    “ Its function then appears to     be threefold—rendering    the slack,
 mobile and ‘<U+FB02>exible vocal organ or tube rigid, tense       and in<U+FB02>exible,
 and <U+FB01>t to produce pure tone;       by its bulk and density acting     as  a
 loader and strengthener,     making the tone more sonorous, full and
 deep,   and thus compensating      for want of length   and size in the
 organ; and <U+FB01>nally, by its varying shape, bulk, density and pressure,
 furnishing an ;important aid in producing the inimitable qualities of
 modulation and expression enjoyed by the human voice.
    “ That it is a part of the organ of voice and an important accessory
 in giving it perfection, may be inferred also from its situation on the
 larynx and trachea, and its being supplied by the same nerves—its
 being largest in man, where the voice and speech are perfect-—its
 being proportionally larger     in women and children than in men,
 their smaller and more mobile organs requiring its peculiar aid.
 Among the lower animals, it is present (at least in a fully developed
 condition) only in the Mammalia, but among them there is a remark
able exception in the Cetacea-—they have it not, and they have no
voice.     In Birds, which   have such great power and modulation         of
voice, the structure of the vocal organ and tube is different from that
in man, and su<U+FB02>icient in itself to produce these qualities.
    “ The importance of the thyroid body must be admitted when it         is
shown to be necessary for the perfection of the voice, and hence of
speech—-—that great and indispensable       agent in the cultivating   and
advancing the highest faculties of man.”

ends <U+FB01>at, was about three times as strong as a pillar of the same
length and diameter with its ends rounded in such a manner that the
pressure would pass through the axis, the ends being made to turn
easily, but not so small as to be crushed by the weight                                   ;    2nd, that
if a   pillar of the       same length and diameter as the preceding                            had one
end rounded            and one <U+FB02>at, the strength would be twice as great as
that   of   one   with both       ends rounded             ;      3rd,   if,   therefore, three pillars
be taken, differing             only in the form of their ends, the <U+FB01>rst having
both ends rounded,                   the   second one              end rounded          and one <U+FB01>at,

using the Low Moor iron in the hollow pillars employed on this
occasion, not on account of its superior strength, but its other good
qualities.     The pillars from this iron were cast                                10 feet long,     and
from    2%   to inches diameter, approaching in some

to the smaller ones used in practice.            The results from the breaking
weights of these were             moderately consistent with the formulae in the
former paper, with               a   slight    alteration           of the constants, rendered
necessary by the castings being of                     a       larger size, and therefore softer
than before,       a    matter which will be adverted to further on.

 10 feet long and 2% inches diameter, cast out                      of   eleven    kinds of iron
 (nine simple irons and two mixtures). The pillars were all from the

    The mean strength of the pillars from the irons                          above varies from
 20-05 to 29'50 tons; or as 2 to 3 nearly.
    The pillars formed of mixed irons were found to                            be weaker than
the three strongest of the unmixed series.
    From many experiments, it                  was   shown that the weight which
would crush the pillars,           if they were very short, would vary as 5 to                 9
nearly.
    The pillars in general were broken of four different lengths, 10 feet,
7  feet 6 inches, 6 feet 3 inches, and 5 feet, the ends of all being turned
<U+FB02>at, and perpendicular            to the axis.        It    was found that when the
length was the same, the strength                   varied as the 3'5 power of the
diameter;    and when the diameter was the same and the length varied,
the strength was inversely as the 1'63 power of the length.                                Both
of  these were obtained from the mean results                      of many experiments.
    The formula for the strength of              a solid    pillar would therefore         be
                                              ds-5
                                  w=m X
                                              lrsa’
where w is the breaking weight, d the diameter in inches,                           lthe length

in feet, and   m a  weight which varied from 49'94 tons in the strongest
iron   we tried, to  3360 tons in the weakest.
    The ultimate decrement of length, in pillars of various lengths but
of the same diameter, varies inversely as the length nearly.             Thus
the ultimate     decrements of pillars       10 feet,   7 feet 6 inches, 6 feet
3 inches, and 5 feet, vary as 2, 3, 3% and 4 nearly, according to the
experiments,     from which      it appeared that the      mean   decrement of
a 10-feet   pillar was  '1 76 inch.
                          Irregularity in Cast Iran.
    The formulae -arrived at in this paper are on the supposition that
 the iron of which the pillars are composed is uniform throughout the
 whole section in every part;        but this was not strictly the case in any
 of the solid pillars experimented upon. They were always found to
 be softer in the centre than in other parts.                To ascertain the
 difference of strength in the sections of the pillars used, small cylin
 ders  § inch diameter and      1%  inch high,   were cut from the centre, and
 from the part between the centre and the circumference, and there
 was always found to be a difference in the crushing strength of the
 metal from the two parts, amounting perhaps to about one-sixth.
 The thin rings of hollow cylinders resisted in a much higher degree
 than the iron from solid cylinders.         As an example, the central part
 of a solid cylinder of Low Moor iron No. 2, was crushed with 29'65
 tons per square inch-, and the part nearer to the circumference re
 quired 34'59 tons per square inch        ; cylinders out of a thin shell half
 an inch thick, of the same iron, required 39'06 tons per square inch           ;
 and other cylinders from still thinner         shells of the same metal, re
 quired 50 tons per square inch, or upwards, to crush them.
     As these variations in cast iron have been little inquired into,        ex
  cept by myself, and have never, so far as           I  know, been subjected
  to computation,     I   have bestowed considerable trouble         upon   the
  matter, in an experimental point of view, and endeavoured to intro
  duce into the formulae previously given, changes which will in some
  degree include the irregularities      observed.

t.iv. (1852), whereby the determination of the symmetric functions
of any system of (n—1) equations, and of the resultant of any sy

the author accordingly obtains expressions, as regards the <U+FB01>rst system,
for the fundamental symmetric functions or symmetric functions of
the <U+FB01>rst degree in respect to each set of roots, and for the symmetric
functions of the second and third degrees respectively, and as regards
the second system, for the fundamental symmetric functions or sym

of the second     degree    in respect to          each set         of roots.

   VI. “Memoir        on the Conditions     for the Existence of given
           Systems of Equalities   among the Roots of an Equation.”
           By ARTHUR CAYLEY, Esq., F.R.S.         Received December 18,

                                  (Abstract.)
      It  is well known that there is a symmetric function of the roots of
   an equation, viz. the product of the squares of the differences of the
   roots, which vanishes when any two roots are put equal to each other,
   and that consequently such function expressed in terms of the coe<U+FB01>i
   cients and equated to zero, gives the condition for the existence  of a
   pair of equal roots. And it was remarked long ago by Professor
                                                    ‘
   Sylvester, in some of his earlier papers in the    Philosophical Maga
   zine,’ that the like method could be applied to <U+FB01>nding the conditions
   for the existence of other systems of equalities among the roots, viz.
   that it was possible to form symmetric functions, each of them a sum
   of terms containing the product of a certain number of the di<U+FB01>erences
   of the roots, and such that the entire function might vanish for the
   particular system of equalities in question; and that such functions
   expressed in terms of the coe<U+FB02>‘icients and equated to zero would give
   the required    conditions.  The object of the present memoir is to
   extend this theory, and render it exhaustive by showing how to form
   a series of types of all the different functions which vanish for one

   The general expressions for the Sturmian functions in the form of
determinants,     are at once deducible from the researches      of Professor
Sylvester     in his early papers on the subject in the ‘Philosophical
                                                                 “ Nouvelles
Magazine,’ and in giving these expressions in the memoir
Recherches sur les Fonctions de M. Sturm,” Liouville, t. xiii. p. 269
(1848),     I  was wrong     in claiming     for them any novelty.         The
expressions in the last-mentioned memoir admit of a modi<U+FB01>cation by
which their form is rendered somewhat more elegant; I propose, on
the present occasion, merely to give this modi<U+FB01>ed form of the general
expression,     and to give the developed expressions of the functions
in question for equations of the      degrees,  two, three, four and <U+FB01>ve.

I. “ Photo-chemical          Researches.—-Part         II.  Phenomena      of
      Photo-chemical Induction.”            By Prof. BUNSEN of Heidel
      berg, and HENRY ENFIELD Rosoon, B.A., Ph.D.                      Com
      municated by Prof. Sroxns, Sec. R.S. Received November
      27, 1856.
                                (Abstract.)
   Chemical affinity, or the force which regulates the chemical com
bination    of two bodies, is like‘ all other forces, a certain de<U+FB01>nite
quantity.     Hence  it is erroneous   to say, that under different circum
stances   the same body can possess different a<U+FB01>inities     ;  more correctly
we should say, that in the one case the bodies are able to follow the
chemical attraction of their molecules, whilst in another case opposing
forces render this combination        impossible.     These opposing forces
may be considered as resistances similar           to those exerted in the
passage of electricity     through conductors,       in the distribution of
magnetism in steel, and in the conduction of heat.              Welovercome
these resistances when by agitation we increase the formation            of  a
precipitate,   or by insolation effect a decomposition.
   We call the act by which these resistances to combination are
lessened, and the formation of a chemical\ compound promoted,
“chemical induction ;” and we specify this as photo-chemical, thermo
chemical, electro-chemical,     or idio-chemical,   according as light, heat,
electricity,  or pure chemical action is the force which promotes the
combination.
   The phenomena         of pho'to-chemical     induction    are particularly
interesting,   as affording   starting-points   from which we may gain a
knowledge of this mode of action of a<U+FB02>inity.
   That on exposing     a mixture    of chlorine and hydrogen to the light
 the action does   not commence to its full extent at once, was observed

                                                   327
      by Draper    in 1843.           An explanation of this fact                 was given by the
      supposition that the chlorine              underwent on insolation a permanent
     allotropic modi<U+FB01>cation,           in which     state    it    possessed      more than usually
     active   properties.        This explanation           is,   as we shall show, erroneous,
     and the    whole phenomenon            is   caused by the peculiar action to                   which
     we have     given the name of photo-chemical                        induction.          When the
     standard mixture       of chlorine and hydrogen                  is   exposed      to   a    constant
     source    of light, no action         is   at <U+FB01>rst perceptible;            after   a    short time,
     however,    the action becomes visible, and gradually increases                               until   a
     constant    maximum         is   reached.       Experiments            made with di<U+FB02>'erent
     amounts     of light from di<U+FB01>'erent luminous                    sources,     showed that the
     times which       elapsed     from the beginning of the exposure until the
     maximum was obtained, varied very much,                               according         to circum
    stances.      In   one case the maximum                   action was reached in <U+FB01>fteen
    minutes, in others after an exposure of three and four minutes.
    The <U+FB01>rst action       was    in   one case visible after six minutes’ insolation,
    in others after      one minute,       whilst in     some experiments            a   considerable
    action was observed in the <U+FB01>rst minute.
      The condition modifying the action of the induction which we
    <U+FB01>rst examined, was the action of the mass of the insolated gas. From
    various experiments,         it    was found that the duration                 of the induction
    increased with the volume of exposed gas (by constant amounts of
    light), and curves have been drawn, representing the increase of the
    induction for the various volumes of                 gas employed.
      We next examined the                 dependence         of the duration of induction
    upon the amount of light to which                    a        constant volume of gas was
    exposed, and experiment showed—
       1. That the time necessary to effect the <U+FB01>rst action of the photo
    chemical induction           decreases with increase              of light, and in        a    greater
'
    ratio than the      increase      of light.
      2. That the time which                elapses      until the maximum                   is   attained
    also   decreases with increase          of light, but in         a   much less ratio.
      3. That the        increase      of the induction proceeds                  at <U+FB01>rst in an ex
    panding series, attains   maximum, and then converges when the
                                       a
    true maximum action     attained.
                                   is The law regulating the increase
    of the      induction    by increase          of light,        we    have rendered visible
    by curves.
      The results of        these       experiments suggested               the    question, Is this

condition of increased combining          power, into which the mixture of
chlorine    and hydrogen        passes   by insolation,    permanent,    or is it
con<U+FB01>ned to the time during which the gas is exposed to the light’!
In   order to determine this question, the sensitive gas, which had
stood for some time in the dark, was exposed to a constant source of
light, and the time noted which elapsed before the maximum                 action
was reached;       the apparatus was then darkened for one minute, and
then again insolated, and the time watched until the maximum action
was again observed.         These observations were repeated several times,
each period      of darkening    being longer than the preceding.           Thus
conducted, the experiment led to the important conclusion, that the
resistance to combination        overcome by the in<U+FB02>uence of the light is
soon restored when the gas is allowed to stand in the dark.               Curves
expressing the effect produced          on induction     by darkening, and by
exposure to light, have been drawn.
   We have explained the fact, that the mixture                 of chlorine   and
hydrogen does not combine in the dark, by the supposition of the
existence of a resistance to combination which is overcome when the
gaseous    mixture is exposed to light.        This resistance to combination
can be increased by various circumstances.              The  presence  of  a very
small quantity of foreign gas in the standard mixture of chlorine and
hydrogen      is sufficient   to cause the resistance to be increased to a
very great extent.        An   excess  of  T6375  of hydrogen over that con
tained in the normal gas, reduced the action from 100 to 38.
   In   these   experiments we have to do with the purest form of the
so-called catalytic actions, to which the photo-chemical             phenomena
are   closely related.      The quantitative estimation of the relations
which exist in the phenomena of contact, between the mass of the
substance      the   time and other modifying conditions,           has   not as
yet been possible, owing to the absence of any case in which                these
relations   are   exhibited    in their simplest form.          Our method      of
photo-chemical       measurement points out a direction which promises
to afford interesting results concerning         these quantitative   relations;
but in this communication         we restrict ourselves to the consideration
of  these phenomena        in so far as they in<U+FB02>uence the action      of photo
chemical     induction,   intending   on a future      occasion to enter more
fully into the new <U+FB01>eld of research indicated.
   The contact action of foreign         gases is  still more strongly    seen  in

                                        329
  the case  of small quantities of oxygen.             This     gas, when present          in
  quantities  amounting-only to         T-bio-6   of the total volume of                gas,
  diminishes   the action from      100    to 4'7, whilst          1-,‘,-$5   reduced the
  action from    100   to 1'3.    Excess of chlorine               acted in a similar
  manner, though not to so greatan extent,              -,‘T‘?-;; of this     gas reducing
  the action from     100 to   602, and         7%“-<,"—°from      100     to   4l'3.    On
  examining   the effect of small quantities            of hydrochloric acid             gas
 upon the induction maximum, we found, fortunately for the accuracy
 of the indications of our instrument, that        an amount         of 3%‘-0 of this    gas
 does not produce any appreciable effect on the action                 of the induction.
  Uninsolated   gas was found to act        similarly on the normal mixture,
 the admission of
  100 to 55.
                     %      of non-insolated       gas reducing the action from
                  Curves    have been drawn,           representing           the relation
 between the action and the amount of foreign                   impurity introduced.
 Several series  of experiments also showed that a mixture of chlorine
 and hydrogen, which was so nearly pure that no alteration of the
 maximum action was observable, was longer in attaining the maximum
 than the perfectly pure gas; hence the duration                      of the induction
 serves as an exact measure     of ‘the   absence      of all foreign         gases  in the
 standard mixture.                  ,
    An explanation of the laws of photo-chemical                    induction derived
 from the above-mentioned experiments, might easily                     be found in the
 assumption that the chlorine or the hydrogen, or both gases, undergo
 upon exposure to light a change similar               to that between            common
 and ozonized oxygen, or that these              two gases can, under certain
 circumstances,    be   invested with active, and, under other                     circum
 stances, with passive properties.         If   this hypothesis           be true,     each
gas must undergo this peculiar modi<U+FB01>cation when separately exposed
to the action of the light.      That this is not the case was shown by
the following experiment :—The two gases were separately evolved,
and each led through a long glass tube, in which                         they could      be
separately exposed to the action of diffuse and direct sunlight.                      After
this exposure, the gases passed through a connecting tube into the
apparatus, in which a constant source of light gave the duration of the
induction.     Thus alternately insolating and darkening the separated
gases, we observed the effect      on the gases subsequently mixed and
exposed to lamplight.       No difference was perceptible in the duration
                                                                                             '
of the induction between the          gases‘ previously          insolated and those

                                 I          V W
                                                                               .
                                     330
evolved in the dark.      Hence we may conclude, that the light does
not e<U+FB01>'ect a permanent modi<U+FB01>cation, either of the chlorine or hydrogen,
but that the combination       produced    by the light must depend on
photo-chemical    action affecting only the increasing attractions of the
chemically active molecules.
    All  the curves representing     the increase of the induction      under
various conditions    have a common form, and a point of <U+FB02>exure at
which the maximum increase occurs.          In order   to determine whether
this common property of the curves arises from the general mode of
action of a<U+FB01>inity, or whether      the light plays an essential part, we
have made experiments        upon idio-chemical      induction,   i. e. action
in which pure chemical attractions alone effect the alteration.            For
this purpose we employed a dilute aqueous solution of bromine with
tartaric acid, which mixture, when left to itself in the dark, under
goes decomposition, hydrobromic acid being formed.               By determi
ning the amount of free bromine contained in the liquid at di<U+FB01>"erent
times, we became acquainted with the rate at which the decompo
sition occurred.     Analysis showed that the amount of hydrobromic
acid formed was     not the same in equal spaces of time; and curves
representing this increase were found to have the form obtained for
the photo-chemical      induction.     Hence the cause of this maximum
increase appears not to lie in any peculiar          property   of light, but_
 rather in the mode of action    of a<U+FB01>finity itself.
     One   of the many interesting applications of the laws of photo
 chemical induction relates to the phenomena of photography.                As
 an instance of this application we cite the remarkable          observations
 of Becquerel, which induced him to assume the existence of certain
 rays which can continue, but not commence, chemical action.                 In
 order to explain the phenomenon observed by the French physicist,
 we do not need to suppose the existence of a new property of light, as
 the facts are easily explained by the laws of photo-chemical       induction ;
 and we are satis<U+FB01>ed that these relations, which we have examined
  only in the case of chlorine and hydrogen, occur in a slightly modi
  <U+FB01>ed form in other photo-chemical      processes.           _
     Having determined in this part of our investigation the most im
  portant phenomena of photo-chemical induction, we shall in the
  next section consider the laws which regulate the chemical action           of
  light after the induction is completed.

II.   “ Observations on Glaciers.”            By Jorm TYNDALL, Esq.,
       F.R.S., and THOMAS H. HUxLEY, Esq., F.R.S.                   Received
       January 15, I857.
                                 (Abstract.)
    On the 6th of June, 1856, certain views were advanced by one of us
on the origin of slaty cleavage, and soon afterwards his attention was
drawn by the other to the observations of Prof.         J.  D. Forbes on the
structure of glacier ice, as suggesting the idea that the ice structure
might be due     to the same cause as the slate cleavage.      On consulting
the observations referred to, the lecturer at once perceived the proba
bility of the surmise, and the consequence was a joint visit for       a few
 days to the glaciers of Grindelwald, the Rhone, and the Aar.            The
 subject being a physical one,     it was followed   up by the physicist on
 his return from the Continent.        Reading, re<U+FB02>ection, and experiment
 extended the inquiry until it embraced the main divisions of the
 problem    of glacial structure and motion; and the paper now sub
 mitted to the Society contains an account of the investigation.
     The <U+FB01>rst division is devoted to the consideration of certain phe
 nomena connected with the motion of glaciers.             The power of gla
 ciers to accommodate themselves to the sinuosities of the valleys which
 they    occupy,   and the resemblance of their motion          through such
 valleys   to the motion of a river,       suggest   ideas which <U+FB01>nd     their
  clearest expression in the viscous theory         of glacier motion,    pro
 pounded      by Prof. J. D. Forbes.        Numerous appearances indeed
  seem to favour this notion.      The aspect of many glaciers as a whole,
  their power of closing up crevasses, and of reconstructing themselves
  after having   been precipitated    down glacial gorges; the bendings and
  contortions   of the ice, the quicker movement of the central portion
  of the glacier where it is unin<U+FB02>uenced by the retardation of the
  banks,—are all circumstances          which have    been   urged with such
  ability  as to leave  the viscous theory without any formidable        com
  petitor  at present.    To these   may be added, the support which the
  theory derived from its apparent competency to explain the laminar‘
  structure of the ice,-—a structure which it is affirmed is impossible
  of explanation upon any other hypothesis.

                                       332
     Nevertheless     this theory is so directly opposed to our ordinary
  experience of the nature of ice, as to leave a lingering doubt of its
  truth upon the mind.         To remove this doubt it is urged, that the
  true nature of ice is to be inferred from experiments on large masses,
  and that such experiments place the viscosity of ice in the position
  of  a fact rather than in that    of  a theory.   It has never been ima
  gined that     the bendings    and contortions,   and other evidences of
  apparent viscosity exhibited by a glacier, could be made manifest on
  hand specimens of ice.      In  the present paper, however, this is shown
  to be possible.     Spheres of ice are described as being <U+FB02>attened into
  cakes,  and squeezed into transparent lenses.      A  straight prism of ice
  six inches long, is described as having been passed through a series of
  moulds augmenting in curvature, and <U+FB01>nally coming out bent into a
  semi-ring.     A  piece of ice is placed in a hemispherical   cavity and is
 pressed upon by a protuberance         not large enough to    <U+FB01>ll the cavity,
 and is thus squeezed into a cup.         In short, every observation made
 upon glaciers, and adduced by writers upon the subject in proof of
 the plasticity of ice, is shown to be capable of perfect imitation with
 hand specimens in the laboratory.
     These experiments, then, demonstrate a capacity on the part of
 small   masses    of ice which has hitherto      been  denied to them by
 Writers upon this subject.        They prove to all appearance that the       _
 substance is even     much more plastic than it has hitherto been sup
 posed to be; but the real germ from which these results have sprung,
 is to be found in a lecture given by     Mr. Faraday at the Royal Institu
tion in 1850, and reported in the ‘Athenaeum’ and ‘Literary Gazette’
for that year. Mr. Faraday then showed, that when two pieces of
ice, at a temperature of 32° Fahr., are placed in contact, they freeze
together by the conversion of the <U+FB01>lm of moisture between them into
ice.    The  case  of a snow-ball was referred to as a familiar   illustration
of the principle: when the snow is below 32°, and therefore dry, it
will not cohere, whereas when it is in a thawing condition, it can be
squeezed    into a hard compact mass.       During one of the hottest days
of last July, when the temperature was upwards of 100° Fahr. in the
sun, and more than 80° in the shade, a number of pieces of ice
placed loosely together in a window in the Strand, were observed by
one   of us   to be frozen  together; and he subsequently caused pieces
of ice to  freeze together under     hot water. Hence the thought arose,

that    if    a piece      of    ice, a straight       prism for example, were             placed in
a bent mould               and submitted          to pressure, it would break, but the
continuance of the force would bring its severed surfaces to reunite,
and that thus the continuity                     of the mass might              be re-established.
Experiment,           as we have seen, completely con<U+FB01>rmed this surmise;                             the
ice passed from a continuous straight bar to a continuous bent one;
the transition being effected, not by a viscous yielding of the particles,
but through fracture and regelation.
  All the phenomena on which the idea of viscosity has                                              been
founded, are brought by experiments similar to the above into har
mony with the demonstrable                       properties of ice.            In virtue of these
properties          the glacier accommodates itself to its bed; crevasses are
closed        up, and the broken                 ice     of   a cascade,    such as that of the
Talefre or the Rhone,                    is recompacted           to a solid continuous         mass.
But     if     the glacier effects its movement in virtue of the incessant
fracture and regelation of its parts, this process will in all probability
be accompanied by an audible cracking                                of the     mass,    and thus a
noise of decrepitation may                    be expected to be heard,               which would      be
absent       if   the motion were that of a viscous body.                         It   is well known
that such noises are heard, and they thus                                  receive     a satisfactory

explanation
  *    It    is manifest       that the continuity of the fractured ice cannot be completely
and immediately re-established after rupture; it is not the same surfaces that are
regelated,        and hence the new contact cannot
                                                 be perfect throughout.    After rup
ture the surfaces of fracture will enclose for a time capillary <U+FB01>ssures, and thus the
                                                                                                                  ,,_.__-.-..._,-,-.,.,.--1-.7
above theory is in harmony with the known structure of glacier ice.                          Since   the
paper was presented to the Society,             I (on January
                                               30th) made the following experi
ments bearing upon this point :—A piece of ordinary ice was taken, and a cavity
hollowed in it was <U+FB01>lled with an infusion of cochineal; the ice was perfectly
impervious to the liquid, which remained in it for half an hour without pene                                 .,
trating it in the slightest degree.                A   piece of the same ice was        subjected    to it
gradually increasing pressure.                Flashes     of light were seen to issue from it at
intervals, which indicated the rupture of optical continuity, and a low, and in
some    instances,        almost musical crackling was heard at the same time.                Relieved
from the pressure, the ice appeared continuous to the naked eye, but a cavity
being formed and the cochineal infusion placed within it, the coloured liquid
immediately diffused              itself through the capillary <U+FB01>ssures, producing an appear
ance    accurately resembling the drawings illustrative of the in<U+FB01>ltration experi
ments of M. Agassiz on the glacier of the Aar.

       The next division of the paper treats of the veined or laminar
   structure of glacier ice, which Prof. J. D. Forbes, in his earlier
   writings,     compared    to slaty cleavage.          His theory of the structure
   is perhaps the only one which has made any profound                         impression,
   and     it may be brie<U+FB02>y stated as follows.                  Owing     to the quicker
   <U+FB02>ow of the centre of a glacier, a sliding of the particles of» ice past
   each other takes place; in consequence of this sliding, <U+FB01>ssures are
   produced, which, when <U+FB01>lled with water and frozen in winter, pro
   duce the blue veins of the glacier.             To account for the obliquity of
   the veins to the       sidesof the glacier,        a drag towards        the centre is
    supposed to take place, producing a differential motion which results
   in the formation of <U+FB01>ssures.             But at the centre of the glacier this
    drag towards it cannot be          supposed to exist; and to account for the
   veined or laminated         structure    of the centre, which,          under normal
    conditions, is transverse to the length of the glacier, it is supposed
   that the thrust behind meeting an enormous resistance in front, pro
   duces a differential motion in a direction approximating                   to the verti
    cal, and that in consequence of this motion                  <U+FB01>ssures are produced,
   which, when <U+FB01>lled and frozen, produce,                  as  in the other     cases,    the
   blue veins.       In  the present paper it is observed that the only fact
   connected with this theory, is that of differential motion in the direc
    tion of the length of the glacier.          Beyond this, all is conjecture.             It
   refers   to an observation which might be made on a <U+FB01>ne day in summer,                 and
   which would show the air within the glacier ice escaping          from its surface.     M.
   Agassiz supposes the ice to be diathermanous, and that thus the sun-beams               get
  through it and heat the air-bubbles which it encloses, causing the air to expand,
  rupture the ice, and escape in the manner observed.               The observation    is an
   interesting one, whatever di<U+FB02>iculty we may <U+FB01>nd in the explanation.             An experi
  ment made to-day (January 31) appears to me to account for the observation in a
   satisfactory manner.     Snow having fallen, I was early at work compressing it;
   and on removing a plate of     it from the  press,  I  noticed, as the surface  melted,    a
  sparkling motion produced by the escape of the air enclosed within the mass.
  To imitate the action of the sun upon the glacier, an iron spatula was heated,
  and on bringing     it near the  surface of the compressed     snow, the jumping of the
  surface,    caused by the issue of air through the <U+FB01>lm of water which covered             it,
  was    greatly augmented.     On removing the spatula the motion subsided.             To a
  similar action on the part of the sun melting the surface of the glacier, and thus
  liberating by degrees the air-bubbles with which the ice is <U+FB01>lled, the observation
  of M. Agassiz is in all probability to be referred.—J.      T.
                                                                                        Y

                                        335
is by no means established          that the cold of winter           can reach to
depths su<U+FB01>icient to produce the blue veins, which are a<U+FB01>irmed to be a
         “ of the inmost structure” of the
portion                                            glacier.    Again, the lamina-    -
tion in some cases presents itself in the form of transparent lenticular
masses, imbedded        in the general substance of the white ice.             The
di<U+FB01>'erential motion referred to would be mechanically                inadequate to
produce    detached cavities       corresponding      to   these masses,     which
vary greatly in size,        and in some      cases   accurately     resemble   the
greenish spots seen in slate rock when a section perpendicular to the
cleavage is exposed.         Further,   as the <U+FB01>ssures are produced by the
motion of the glacier, and as this motion takes place both in summer
and winter, it is to be inferred that they are formed at both seasons
of the year.      But    if formed in winter,       they cannot be <U+FB01>lled and
frozen that season for want of water; and,               if  formed in summer,
they cannot be frozen while           summer continues for want of cold.
Hence, at the end of each summer there ought,                if  the above theory
be correct, to be a whole year's unfrozen            <U+FB01>ssures in the ice.      Such
<U+FB01>ssures could not possibly escape observation               if  they existed;   but
they never have been observed,—hence              it is inferred that they have
no existence.      With regard to the drag towards the centre of the
glacier, it is observed, that if such       a drag existed, the centre would
ultimately   absorb the sides, unless the loss were made good by a
motion    in  some    part of the glacier,      from the centre towards the
sides, which would        be  in opposition    to the theory.          Experiments
 are described   which prove that no such drag exists, and the actual
motion observed is reduced to its elementary mechanical principles.
With regard to the transverse lamination at the centre of the glacier,
the hypothesis     involves, among others, the di<U+FB02>iculty of supposing
that <U+FB01>ssures can be formed in a mass assumed to be viscous, at right
angles to the direction of an enormous pressure to which the mass is
subjected.
    An attempt is next        made   to apply the theory of slaty cleavage,
propounded      by one of the authors, to the laminated structure of
glacier ice.    It is shown that this lamination, like that of slate rock,             1'
                                                                                        .
is always approximately at right angles to the direction of maximum                     .
pressure ;—-that      local circumstances       which give rise to        a violent
thrust, produce      at the same      time a highly developed lamination.
When two con<U+FB02>uent glaciers unite to form               a single   trunk, the  e<U+FB01>'ect

                                                 336
   of their mutual thrust is to develope the veined structure along their
   line of junction.          This is illustrated in the case of the Aar and other
-
   glaciers;      and experiments are described which show the mechanical
   condition of such glaciers, and that the veined structure of the ice,
   which sometimes rises               to a case  of “true cleavage,” occurs at                 the
   precise places where the compression theory would lead one to expect
   it.    The lenticular         structure before referred to, the obliquity of the
   veins to the sides of the glacier, the transverse lamination                            at the
   centre, the relation           of the blue bands to the            crevasses,      are   all in
   perfect harmony with this theory.                    Indeed, unless we suppose the
   ice of glaciers to be perfectly homogeneous, mechanically                          speaking,
  'we must infer that under pressure some portions will be rendered
    more compact than others, and the veined structure is the natural
    consequence*.
        Finally, the well-known phenomenon of “dirt-bands”                             upon the
    surfaces of glaciers is considered, and an explanation of those bands,
    as seen upon the glaciers           of Grindelwald and the Rhone, is attempted.
    On the former glacier thevbands                 were    particularly well developed;
       * Since the presentation of        the paper,  I  have tried to reproduce the veined
    structure on a small scale by compressing snow.            In  some cases the section         of
   the mass perpendicular to the surfaces            on which the pressure      was exerted,     ex
   hibited in a feeble but distinct manner an appearance the same in kind               as  that of
    the veined     structure of the glacier ice; stripes     more  transparent than the sur
    rounding ice were observed at right angles to the direction of pressure.                 I have
    also succeeded in impressing upon a perfectly transparent           prism of ice a cleavage
    which certainly surpassed my expectations.            The cleavage,  as   in the case of the
    glacier and of slate rock, is perpendicular to the direction of pressure.                    On
   placing a specimen       of the squeezed mass before a highly competent           judge, he at
    <U+FB01>rst imagined it to be      a piece  of gypsum.     The full details of these experiments
    shall be communicated in due time to the Royal Society.                   The case, then, as
    regards   slaty cleavage and the structure of glacier ice, stands thus :—The testimony
    of independent       observers   proves  that they are both laminated at right angles to
    the direction of pressure; and the question          occurs, Is the pressure     su<U+FB01>icient to
    produce the cleavage      P  Experiment replies in the a<U+FB02>irmative.      I  have reduced slate
    rock to an almost impalpable powder, and reproduced from it the lamination by
   pressure.      In the glacier we <U+FB01>nd equally the cleaved structure associated with
    pressure,    and   the above experiments      prove the su<U+FB02>iciency      of the    pressure    to
    produce the structure.        By combining the conditions of nature, we have produced
    her results; and it may perhaps          be questioned   whether a theory is capable          of
    more convincing proof than that thus furnished.—J.            T.

                                            337
and a portion     of the glacier where they did not exist                   was presented
to us simultaneously       with the bands upon another portion.                     Their
proximate      origin and <U+FB01>nal completion               were thus before us.          The
explanation offered in the paper is, that the dirt scattered by ava
lanches and winds over the upper regions of a glacier is redistri~
buted by the passage of the glacier down a cascade where the ice is
shattered, and the dirt broken up into detached patches.                        On reach
ing the bottom, where the force becomes one of compression, the
patches of dirt are squeezed longitudinally and drawn out laterally,
being thus converted into stripes of discoloration, which, owing to                                   _
the speedier motion of the centre of the glacier, are convex towards                              if
its lower extremity.        On consulting the map of Prof. Forbes, it will
be seen that the dirt-bands      commence at the base of the ice-fall of
the Talefre, while none exist above                 the fall.   Those shown on the
Glacier du Géant,        we are led to infer, commence at the base                 of the
Cascade of la Noire, which, however, is not sketched on the map.
The theory of Prof. Forbes            is,   that   a   glacier, throughout       its entire
length,   is   composed of alternate segments              of hard and porous ice;
that the dirt    is   washed from the former, but <U+FB01>nds              “   a   lodgement” in       -'.
the latter, thus giving rise to the phenomenon of the hands.                              We
are unacquainted         with the experiments             on which this          theory    is
founded, and have only to state, that the bands which we have ob
served seem accounted for by the simple explanation                           given above.
In   the paper, experiments are described illustrative                  of this view, and
in which the bands are accurately exhibited on                  a   small scale.
   In the course of the inquiry much assistance was derived from the
use of troughs of various shapes and sizes, through which mud,
formed by the mixture of <U+FB01>nely-sifted pipeclay and water, was per
mitted to <U+FB02>ow.           Coloured     circles being stamped upon the mud,
from the distortion of        these      the character of the forces, whether
compression or tension, acting upon the mass was inferred.                            It   is
needless to say, that this mode of experiment does not pledge the
authors to the view that ice        is   similarly constituted to mud.             Where
the mud stretches, the ice breaks;                 and the experiments were mainly
instituted for the purpose of examining the relation of the forces                     act
ing upon        glacier to its directions of fracture.

     It may, however,     be urged, that, after all, the foregoing experiments
do not prove the viscous theory               to be wrong.          The mere fact of

                                     338
bending a prism of ice by fracture         and regelation, does not prove
that ice is non-viscous.     This is perfectly true; nor      is'it conceived
that the onus rests on us to prove the negative           here.    All that is
claimed for the foregoing experiments is the referring         of certain   ob
served phenomena to a true cause, instead of to an imaginary               one.
An illustration may perhaps       serve to place    this question in its true
light.   By Newton’s     calculation,   the velocity of sound through air
was one-sixth less than what observation made            it; and to account
for this discrepancy     be   supposed    that  the sound     passed    instan
taneously through     the particles   of air, time being required only to
accomplish     the passage from particle to particle.       He‘ supposed the
diameter    of each air-particle  to be -H-2-ths of the distance between
two particles,    and nobody     ever proved him wrong.           Still, when
Laplace assigned a cera causa for the discrepancy, the hypothesis             of
Newton,     and other ingenious      suppositions,   were discarded.       The
proof indeed in such     cases consists   in the substitution of   a  fact for

us, the intelligent  reader must himself decide.

   The paper, of which the following is a brief abstract, constitutes
the <U+FB01>rst part of the author’s examination of the hydrocarbons con

                                       339
tained in boghead naphtha.          In it he  gives the results      of his experi
ments on that portion of the <U+FB02>uid which resists the action of mono
hydrated nitric and sulphuric acids.            He had previously stated the
fact of his having obtained a substance possessing the composition
and vapour-density      of butyl*, and had         expressed     a belief that he
should   succeed   in isolating not only that radical, but also propyl,
amyl, and caproyl.       The composition of the radicals varies so little,
that to determine the boiling-points it was necessary to take the
density of the vapour of all those fractions which distilled anywhere
near their known boiling-points;         and in each case he regarded that
fraction  which gave the nearest result as representing the boiling
point of the radical as obtained from the source mentioned.
   Propyl presented itself under the form of          a colourless, very mobile
<U+FB02>uid, having a pleasant odour, and boiling at 68° C.                At    lts°  it had
the very low density of 06745.           Combustion      gave results agreeing
closely with the formula

had not been previously obtained.
   Butyl from the Torbane-hill mineral distils              at 119°,     and has a
density of {)'6945 at 18°; its analysis coincided with the formula

The vapour-density      was found to be 3'88, theory requiring              3'94.
   Amyl distilled    at 159°,   and had a density of 07365 at 18°.                  On
analysis, numbers were obtained agreeing perfectly with the formula
                                     CSO HW
The vapour-density      was found to be     493;     theory requires       4‘9l.
   Caproyl boiled at 202° ; its density at 18°                was   07568.         The
results of analysis accorded with the expression
                                     C24 H96,
which indicates     a vapour-density     of 587, while experiment yielded
5'83.

 in order to determine the residual air.
 II.  “ On the
                 Optical Characters of certain Alkaloids associated
       with Quinine, and of the Sulphates of their Iodo-con1
       pounds.”        By WILLIAM        Bran HERAPATH, M.D., in a
       Letter to Professor S'roKEs, Sec. R.S.            Communicated by
       Professor STOKES.         Received January 8, 1857.
    You will probably recollect that I sent you           some    time since a
small portion of an alkaloid, which at that time         was called    quinidin
in Germany,     but it has since been distinguished from it and named
cinchonidin.     You then examined it for epipolism or <U+FB02>uorescence,
and you pronounced the opinion that it possessed           this property only
in  a minor degree,   and you imagined that this arose from the presence
of  a small per-centage    of at-quinine.
    I have since obtained, through the kindness of        Mr.   J. E. Howard,
specimens of the perfectly pure alkaloids quinidin and cinchonidin,
and <U+FB01>nd that quinidin, which I can now identify as the [3-quinine of
Von Heijningen,      possesse's  the phenomenon of <U+FB02>uorescence or epi
polic dispersion as powerfully as an-quinine     ; whilst cinchonidin,   if per
fectly pure, is devoid of it altogether      ; and recent experiments have
shown me that a small per-centage of quinidin was the cause of the
epipolic dispersion found by you in the specimen of cinchonidin             sent
by me.
   It  may be as well to state that the cinchonidin           tested by water
of chlorine and ammonia         gave  no evidence of green tint, which        it
would have done     if only With       part of either at-quinine or quinidin
had been present, according to some recent experiments of my own.
   I have  also found that    1 gr. of pure quinine or quinidin in 35,000
of water will give an evident “epipolic” appearance; whilst when
diluted with 70,000 grs. of water we have still very evident appear

                                             3-ll
 ances   of “<U+FB02>uorescence” upon the perpendicular wall of the glass
 vessel exposed to the incident light; whilst a bluish milkiness of
 “internal dispersion” may be seen when l gr. of either alkaloid is
 diluted with 700,000 grs. or 10 gallons of distilled water, well
 acidulated in all these cases with sulphuric acid.
    Some other interesting results have followed from these investiga
 tions.    When quinidin is dissolved in an excess of diluted sulphuric
 acid, and the solution mixed with about twice its bulk of spirit, and
 warmed to 130°       F., and tincture of iodine then added in su<U+FB01>icient
 quantity,   and subsequently         set    in repose, beautiful red acicular cry
 stals are deposited;      these, upon recrystallization             from recti<U+FB01>ed spirit,
acquire     an increased     size,    become beautiful             quadrilateral   prisms,
leaving a deep garnet-red by transmitted light, and possessing a clear
bluish-purple re<U+FB02>ected tint; they                are optically      doubly absorbent in
 a  slight degree, and transmit            a brownish-orange           body-colour   when
polarized perpendicular        to axis.        The primary form appears to             be a
 rhombic prism, and         as far as        my present analyses go, appears to
possess centesimally the following composition                    :—
                    Iodine                                        391365

The     excess  arises   from the hydrogen               twice calculated in water of
crystallization.
    These numbers       agree very closely          with the formula
                      (C35 H19   N’ O*+I‘1) SO’ HO+5HO,
and prove it to be the sulphate of iodo-quinidin, very analogous to
the optical quinine compound, yet differing materially in its optical
properties.
    There is another        alkaloid       frequently         associated with quinidin,
which also crystallizes from spirit in the prismatic form like quinidin                     ‘
and cinchonidin, but is another example of epipolism or <U+FB02>uorescence.
                                                                        2 D 2

                                          342
Its iodo-sulphate      is deep    olive-green     in its re<U+FB02>ected tint,       orange
yellow    by transmitted     light, and possessing in an eminent degree
 optically doubly absorbent powers, thin laminae being quite black,
 but still thinner ones give a bistre-brown “ body-colour” when pola
 rized perpendicular     to axis.
    This alkaloid wa also furnished me by the kindness of Mr. Howard,
 but has not yet been su<U+FB02>iciently puri<U+FB01>ed, or in the quantity necessary
 to give certain results.
     It possesses  one very peculiar property.        When dissolved in chloro
 form and evaporated spontaneously on glass, the gummy and uncry
 stalline residue, mounted       i.n   Canada balsam, at once shows a deep
 blue-green, epipolic, or <U+FB02>uorescent appearance.
     Pure cinchonidin    does not possess epipolie dispersion and does not
 become green by chlorine-water             and ammonia;      and when      it is dis
  solved in acetic acid or chloroform         and the <U+FB02>uid is exposed on glass
 plates to spontaneous evaporation, beautiful crystals in circular spots
 or drusae develope themselves, which under polarized light exhibit
 black crosses and white or coloured sectors.
    These appearances are not exhibited             by pure quinine or true qui
 nidin (,8-quinine),    both   of which give       a gummy,     uncrystalline,    and
 perfectly transparent residue.                                    ,
     Pure cinchonidin,     thusoptically        and chemically       distinguishable
 from either quinine or quinidin,          is still further remarkable for pro
 ducing with sulphuric acid and iodine an optical doubly absorbent
 compound       of intense power,       even    equal to the sulphate        of iodo
 quinine compound; these crystals              are very similar in form to         my
 arti<U+FB01>cial tourmalines, and have long been mistaken by me for them ;
-even at present I can only distinguish them by the tints in re<U+FB02>ected
 light and the complementary             body-colour,    viz. whilst sulphate        of
 iodo-quinine     gives a cantharidin--green        re<U+FB02>ected    tint,   and a    pink,
 ruby-red,   reddish-brown     or black body-colour when polarized perpen
 dicular to the axis, according to the thickness           of the plate examined,
 the sulphate of iodo-cinchonidin           is golden-green by re<U+FB02>ected         light,
 and gives a   sky or indigo-blue or black
                                                 “ body-colour” when polarized
 perpendicular to the axis.          I  have not yet made sut<U+FB01>cient chemical
 analyses of this substance to enable me to decide on its formula, but
  I have obtained    39'307 per cent. iodine and 8864 per cent.            sulphuric
  acid, which sufficiently indicate a chemical diiference in constitution

                                     343
 from the sulphate     of iodo-quinine,   which,    it may be remembered,
 contains 32'609 per cent. iodine and 1061 per cent. sulphuric acid.
     I  hope soon to present these results in more detail when sufficient
leisure is afforded me for the pur}>ose.—W. B.           H.

I. “On       the  Nervous System of Lumbricus lcrrestris.”               By J.
         Locxuaar Canaan, Esq., F.R.S.           Received Dec. 18, 1856.
                                 (Abstract)
    In   the summer of 1855, with the view of throwing some light on
other researches in human anatomy, in which he                was  already en
gaged, the author undertook some anatomical inquiries on the nervous
system     of Invertebrata; but <U+FB01>nding them occupy more time than he
could spare, he was compelled      to relinquish    the pursuit after having
made many interesting but desultory observations on various animals.
As he had proceeded, however, to a considerable extent with the
nervous system of Lumbricus terrestris, and discovered in it much
that is important and was hitherto unknown,           he has thought it expe
dient to resume and complete this portion             of the subject without
further delay.                                   _
    Before treating of the nervous system it was necessary,—in order to
show the proper functions of many of its parts,—to give some account
of the organs of prehension, deglutition and digestion;           and as these
are   insu<U+FB02>iciently explained elsewhere, the author has described them
entirely from his own dissections and observation.
    The <U+FB01>rst anterior segment is a conical or nipple-shaped projection in
serted behind into the upper <U+FB01>fth of the second segment, or <U+FB01>rst ring.
Its dorsal surface is covered, except in the centre, by concentric laminae
and irregular masses of pigment-granules,            which are interspersed
with large, peculiar and nearly pellucid cells.          Its under part forms

                                      344
a soft and delicate pad, or upper      lip, and is continuous    at the sides
with the inferior half of the second segment, or under lip, to complete
the oral ori<U+FB01>ce from which the mucous membrane of the mouth is
re<U+FB02>ected inwards.       The mouth is    a wide tube surrounded      by a deli
cate muscular coat, and attached to the outer tube, or rings, by <U+FB01>ne
muscular    bands.    Behind, it dilates into     a capacious heart-shaped
sac, of which the roof or upper wall is covered by a thick oval mus
cular mass. The outer portion of this mass is divided into distinct,
radiating, digital muscles which connect it on all sides and are con
tinuous with the longitudinal muscles of the rings.         Its inner surface
projects anteriorly   into the cavity of the pharynx,      in the form of a
thick circular disc or sucker, surrounded         by loose folds of mucous
membrane.      Opening     into the sides of the mouth and pharynx are
two or three sets of salivary glands, which consist of convoluted
tubules, resembling those of Lepidopterous       insects : these glands have
not been hitherto detected in Lumbricus terrestris.            The pharynx
contracts into a comparatively       narrow oesophagus,    which in its turn
dilates into a capacious crop; and this immediately            opens   into a
cylindrical gizzard composed of a ring of cartilage, with an external
muscular coat, and a lining of mucous membrane.              A long straight
and narrow intestine extends through the rest of the body, and is
covered throughout with yellow, follicular, hepatic glands in circles
corresponding to the segments.
   Nervous System.—-The        central organs of the nervous system con
sist chie<U+FB02>y of a bilobed cephalic ganglion, and a double chain of sub
ventral ganglia    extending    through the whole length of the body.
The lateral lobes of the cephalic ganglion are pyriform, and united
by their broader ends in the mesial line.           The small end of each
divides into two nerve-trunks,        of which one forms the root of its
cephalic nerves, and the other, the pharyngeal           crus, which curves
round the side of the pharynx to join the <U+FB01>rst snbventral ganglion.
Each crus gives off eight or nine branches. The <U+FB01>rst four or <U+FB01>ve arise
from the under part of its anterior half, and immediately enter the
upper surface of a minute and delicate cord-like chain of ganglia, the
enlargements of which correspond to them in number and size.             This
highly interesting     structure  lies on the side of the pharynx,        con
 cealed beneath the crus.      The breadth of its <U+FB01>rst ganglionic enlarge
 ment in a—good-sized     worm, was the 7},~oth of an inch; that of the

                                      3&5
 last the  qhth   ;  the pharyngeal crus, where their roots come off, was
Tl-6-th  of an inch in diameter.      Each border    of the chain gives off
several trunks of considerable size, which       immediately communicate
to form a continuous plexus.       The part of the plexus on the inner
side is much     the larger, and supplies anteriorly,     the muscular     and
mucous coats     of the mouth    as far as the  lips; and posteriorly, the
pharynx and suctorial disc; uniting in both directions with its fellow
of the opposite side.       The outer part supplies the muscular bands
and salivary tubules.      From the pharynx, the plexus descends along
the side   of the (esophagus, lying on the abdominal        vessels, and com
municates with minute <U+FB01>laments        from   the nerves    of the subventral
ganglia.
    The whole of this little chain with      a large   portion of its plexus
and the wall of the pharynx on which it lies, was removed and exa
mined under a -gth-inch object-glass, when a beautiful and unexpected
appearance was observed.        The under surface of the entire chain
cords as well as ganglia—was      covered with a lamina of round, oval,
and pyriform cells; and on its upper surface a row of cells             of the
same    kind  was found along each border.      At every point of commu
nication between the branches which form the plexus, a minute gan
glionic enlargement was observed, from which new branches proceeded
to  form other enlargements of the same kind. Every branch com
municated by loops with those adjacent, and by transverse <U+FB01>bres with
those    of the opposite side, giving to the ganglionic points a kind of
stellate appearance.      In these microscopic ganglia, the nerve-cells,
similar to those of the chain,       were  accumulated     chie<U+FB02>y about the
angles, along the borders, and extended some distance into the prin
cipal   trunks; but very few could      be seen in connexion       with nerve
<U+FB01>bres, which ran around and between them, however, in an intricate
manner.     As the plexus extended from the chain, the ganglionic points
diminished in     size, while the smaller branches given off from the
trunks increased in number, and communicated like             a capillary  net
work.      At the same time the ultimate      <U+FB01>bres became       paler, <U+FB02>atter,
more parallel, and acquired nuclei like those      of cells.    This  was par
ticularly observed in those distributed to the mucous membrane.            The
above observations were repeated on nearly forty different specimens.
    On considering the parts which it supplies, this little chain appears
to combine the o<U+FB02>ice of a sympathetic with certain other functions

                                        3/L6  .
  which in many Invertebrata are entrusted to separate and special
  centres ;—such as the labial, pharyngeal, and visceral ganglia in Ce
‘
  phalopodous and Gasteropodous Mollusca, and the separate parts of
  the stomato-gastric     system   of insects, which, although derived from
  di<U+FB01>erent    sources, are in intimate     communication      with each other.
  The lateral ganglia in insects have the same position as the little
  chain of Lumbricus, on the side of the pharynx, which, according to
  Mr. Newport, is supplied entirely by them; they arise, however,
  wholly from the cephalic ganglion, while the chain in Lumbricus has
  just been seen to take its origin both from this and the pharyngeal
  collar; but then, in orthopterous insects, the gangliated recurrent
   nerve, which is always in intimate connexion with the lateral ganglia,
   arises entirely from the pharyngeal crus; and the fact has been ob
   served by Burmeister, Brandt and Muller, that in some other orders
   these two parts, in regard to size, are in the inverse ratio of each
   other.    In Crustacea also, the whole       of the pharyngeal, gastric and
   visceral nerves take their origin from the crura, as was <U+FB01>rst shown
   by Audouin and Milne-Edwards.
      The  second. set  of nerves from the pharyngeal collar come off from
   its posterior half, and communicate with each other by loops before
   they leave it.     The <U+FB01>rst and largest sends some <U+FB01>laments to the
   muscular bands     of the mouth, upon which they communicate by evi
   dent but slight dilatations with the plexus of the pharyngeal chain          ;
   and after supplying the muscles of the anterior segments, are lost in
   the integument      of the lower lip.      The rest take nearly the     same
   course.    But what is extremely interesting, the roots of this sct——at
   least of the <U+FB01>rst and second branches—-are continuous across the crus
   with those of the former      set which belong to the pharyngeal chain;
   and many of their <U+FB01>bres may be traced not only into its ganglia, but
   through the trunks which proceed from their opposite sides to form
  the pharyngeal     ganglionic   plexus;    so that the nerves distributed   to
  the labial muscles and integument        of the outer tube, and those which
   supply the in<U+FB02>ected      oral  and pharyngeal      tube, are in  direct con
   tinuity, not only at their peripheral extremity, but at their roots also,
   through the common centre which presides over the whole of the
   digestive apparatus.      A similar connexion will be seen to exist with
    regard to the cephalic nerves.
       The subventral chain is a double cord gangliated at short intervals

                                    347
by the    addition of vesicular substance.        Anteriorly the cords are
separate and continuous with the pharyngeal crura of their respective
sides; but through the rest of their course they lie in close contact
along the middle line.      The ganglionic enlargements vary somewhat
in size, shape, and approximation at different parts.            The vesicular
substance is on their under surface, and consists         of about two strata
of cells continuous     in a lamina    across both      cords.    Along their
borders, however,     the cells form   a  thicker layer or column, which
extends for some distance along the intervening cords.             In form and
general appearance the cells are similar to those          of the pharyngeal
chain, but many of them are larger.      Those of the <U+FB01>rst ganglion extend
into the lower parts of the crura, and are continuous behind with the
lamina   of the second.     Each ganglion      gives off from its sides two
pairs  of nerves, which, after sending    some filaments to the septa and
muscular bands, supply the longitudinal, oblique and circular muscles
of the rings.     Midway between the ganglia, the intervening cords
give off a single pair, which are distributed to the deep muscles on
each side.    Within the ganglia the roots diverge in three different
ways:—1, longitudinally; 2, transversely; and 3, to the grey or
vesicular substance.     The <U+FB01>rst or longitudinal form a large portion of
the nerves, and run in equal numbers in both directions—backwards
 and  forwards,—along the whole breadth of the corresponding cord.
 In their course, some of them, near the border, separate in succession
from the rest and enter the lateral columns        of cells   ; others proceed
as far as the next nerve,     with the roots of which they form loops,
and pass out, while the rest continue onwards and, perhaps, in suc
cession form similar loops with distant nerves.          In former communi
cations to the Royal Society, the author has shown that the same
kind of arrangement       exists in the spinal cord       of Man and Mam
malia.
   The second or transverse order of <U+FB01>bres        are less numerous, and in
general less distinct than the last.       They proceed from the middle
of each opposite root, and cross the cords directly; but some of
them, on reaching the opposite cord, turn round in both directions,
and run with its longitudinal <U+FB01>bres.         In front of    the <U+FB01>rst ganglion,
in which they    are unusually distinct,   a separate band unites the roots
which descend from the branches arising from the opposite crura of
the pharyngeal collar.

    The third order of <U+FB01>bres, or those distributed to the vesicular sub
stance,    spread out in all directions, but always—except       in the lateral
layers or columns—beneath         the super<U+FB01>cial    stratum.      After nearly
<U+FB01>fty separate examinations, with all the resources of the microscope,
 the author has not been able, in more than two or three instances,
 to trace an undoubted      continuity   between the cells and nerve-<U+FB01>bres.
 Fibres in abundance may be seen in connexion with the cells, but the
 greater number of these are not nervea<U+FB01>bres.          Nevertheless, there is
-reason to believe that such a connexion does frequently          exist, but is
 obscured by certain peculiarities of structure.      Still it is quite certain
 that a vast number of <U+FB01>bres pass by or around the cells near their
 origin, and many often appear to terminate in loops.
     Cephalic Ganglion.—This rests on the commencement of the
 pharynx, beneath the dorsal part of the third ring. Each lobe is a
 pyriform sac, which is very thick and convex posteriorly, where it
 is partially  separated from its fellow by a deep notch.         This convex
 portion is opaque-white,    and <U+FB01>lled with a mass of semi<U+FB01>uid granular
 substance, and oval, round and pyriform cells, of various sizes, but
 often very large.    Some of the latter kind are exceedingly elongated.
 The anterior half, by which the lobes are joined, is merely lined with
 a lamina of cells, and only at its upper part, its under side having a.
 cell here and there.      The interior of this portion is entirely fibrous,
 and consists of a broad transverse commissural          band derived from
 the pharyngeal     collar, and of <U+FB01>bres from the roots of the cephalic
 nerves.     Each crus of the collar enters its lobe on the under side.
 Some of its <U+FB01>bres curve backwards          to the convex vesicular mass;
 others ascend to— perhaps partly terminate in—the cells near the roots
 of the cephalic nerves;     and the rest cross transversely as the broad
band, to be continuous in front of the notch with that of the opposite
crus.     The cephalic nerves     are attached   to the upper part of the
ganglion.      Many of their roots cross transversely with the crural
band, to form loops with those of the opposite lobe.              Decussating
these,    a considerable   number    run down the pharyngeal crus, and
enter the pharyngeal chain of ganglia through its <U+FB01>rst and second
roots, at least,—-perhaps through all,—and probably form loops with
the other set of branches of the crus.        The remaining <U+FB01>bres of the
 cephalic nerves spread through        the vesicular substance, partly de
  scribing curves and undulations     in the corresponding lobe, and corn

                                        349
municating in part with the other in the mcsial line, where they form
a  kind of indistinct decussation in front of the notch.
    Distribution   of  the Cephalic Nerres.—Their         roots on each side
immediately     separate into      two   trunks,  a lower    and upper.       The
former runs above the mouth, to the under side of the <U+FB01>rst conical
segment, or upper lip.         Here it divides into several branches, which
supply its muscular bands, and then terminate in the integulnent as
a plexus,    which appears to communicate with that from the <U+FB01>rst
enlargement of the pharyngeal chain, spread over the tubular month,
which is itself continuous         with the upper lip. The upper trunk
proceeds directly to the corresponding part of the same segment, and
there divides    into two branches,        of which   one  in particular,    after
running the course of the pigmentary laminae, and giving oil‘ a series
of short <U+FB01>laments, terminates at the point, beneath the integument.
    In the pigmentary       laminae    the nerves form an intricate       plexus,
 and   the'impression    was    that many of their ultimate      <U+FB01>bres end in
 loops.    They  were never seen to be      directly connected with the large
 clear cells scattered through the substance. Nor is there any ground
 for conjecture with regard to the o<U+FB01>ice of these cells: perhaps they
 are intended    for the transmission       of light.   From the structure of
 the segment and the      distribution of its nerves, it is not unreasonable
 to think that its upper surface may be instrumental in the perception
 of diffused light; and that its under surface and point may be sub
 servient not only to the sense       of touch, but perhaps also to that of
 smell, in a low degree.       That it forms an important organ of search,
 is pretty evident from       the manner in which it is projected           alter
 nately forwards    and from side to side, as the animal advances in its
 course.
    The upper    side  of the cephalic ganglion corresponds to the under
 side  of the subventral, and     several  points of resemblance are pointed
 out between the two kinds          of centres.     Each pharyngeal crus is
 shown to be a compound structure, composed of different sets of con
 necting <U+FB01>bres,——l, between its own nerves, which supply, on the one
 side, the cephalic portion of the outer tube, and on the other, the
 corresponding    part of the alimentary      tube re<U+FB02>ected inwards from the
  former;   2, between    these nerves and their fellows       of the opposite
  crus, across the front      of the <U+FB01>rst ganglion; 3, between the           same
  nerves and   the    cephalic    ganglion;    and 4, between the cephalic

                                      350
 ganglion   and the same side      of the whole subventral chain. Now
 there is this point of dgference between the two kinds of centres
 compared together,--that      while the last-mentioned         set  of <U+FB01>bres on
 the one side is continuous       with that on the other,         as a transverse
 hand through the cephalic ganglion, the subventral cords, although
 continuous   with these on their respective        sides, form no such con
 nexion with each other across the lateral halves of their own ganglia,
but run parallel     and directly backwards        through them.           Such a
 communication,     however, is established      for the latter, individually,
by the transverse <U+FB01>bres    of their own nerves; and just          as these <U+FB01>bres
unite the lateral halves of each separate ganglion, independently                of
 the cephalic, so do the last-mentioned      set  of <U+FB01>bres of the crura con-I
 nect together the two lateral halves    of the entire chain in and through
 the cephalic   ganglion,    which is their dominant           and     controlling
 centre.                                                        ‘
    Two parts of the human brain may         be compared to this tdansverse
cephalic band.      One is the arched and commissural             band of <U+FB01>bres
prolonged    through the corpora quadrigemina, from the upper and
inner part of the <U+FB01>llet on each side.       But the outer part of the <U+FB01>llet
turns forwards and upwards beneath the corpus geniculatum internum
and optic tract, to enter the optic thalamus.           It is not improbable,
therefore, that some    of the <U+FB01>bres of the tract may descend along
this portion of the <U+FB01>llet, to form loops with the roots of the <U+FB01>fth
nerve, over which it passes, since in Lumbricus it has been seen that
many    of the roots of the cephalic nerves run down the pharyngeal
crus to form loops with others to which it gives origin.              In a former
memoir     by the author, it  was shown     that some of the roots         of the
spinal   accessory nerve reach the anterior         grey cornu and mingle,
perhaps pass out with, the spinal roots; and he has since observed
the equally interesting     fact, that the same        nerve forms a similar
connexion with the vesicular nucleus       of the hypoglossal, which may
be considered a representative      of the anterior      spinal.     The spinal
accessory, therefore,    takes   it origin from at least three di<U+FB02>'erent
sources,—-from    its own nucleus, and from the nuclei of the hypo
glossal and anterior   spinal nerves.     The peripheral communications
of both the former with the latter nerves in the cervical plexus is
well known.     The author believes he has also made out an intimate
connexion by loops between at least the portio              intermedia     of the

                                         351
seventh and the large root       of the <U+FB01>fth nerves within the substance of
the human medulla.
   The other part of the human brain which is analogous, or homo
logous with the cephalic band of Lumbrieua, is the corpus callosum.
Gall and others have thought that the <U+FB01>bres of this structure arise
from     the grey substance          of the hemispheres;           while     some     have
endeavoured to show their continuity with those of the crura cerebri.
Now it is quite certain that in the cephalic ganglion of Lumbricua, a
large proportion      of the commissural               <U+FB01>bres are directly continuous
with those of the pharyngeal crura; and there                  are appearances      which
favour     the conclusion      that some        of the latter     are    con<U+FB01>ned to the
lobe on their own side.              From analogy, then,          we    may infer, that
while a large portion      of the (‘rum cerebri          are directly continuous      with
the corpus callosum, some of their <U+FB01>bres probably terminate in the
cerebral convolutions       of the corresponding side.
     From   what has been shown,      it is evident that the communications
between the roots      of nerves       are    more intimate       and extensive than
they were hitherto believed to be; for it has been seen that the roots
not only of every spinal nerve, but                of every other in the system,
communicate with those which correspond on the opposite, and with
                                                                                             U1~<>.-.

as   guides    to future    investigations        on other forms         of the nervous
system.
   By experiments that were made on the living worm, it is shown
 that the pharyngeal chain of ganglia are independent of the other
 nervous     centres, although        subject     to their in<U+FB02>uence,        and are    not
 only competent of themselves to preside over the complicated move
 ments of the suctorial pharynx and mouth, but appear also to be
 centres    of re<U+FB02>ex action.
  The present memoir concludes with some observations and re
 marks on the ganglionic cords of other Invertebrata.

        J on»: Lusnocx, Esq., F.G.S.          Communicated by CHARLES
        DARWIN, Esq.,      F.R.S.      Received December 22, 1856.
                                  (Abstract.)
     In this paper the author describes the male organs and the structure
 of the Ephippium in the genus Daplmia, and the double method of
 reproduction    by agamic and ephippial eggs. The author calls the
 non-ephippial eggs agamic, but it is possible, though not probable,
 that the ephippial eggs may be agamic also. In the male Dap/mia
 there are two small papillae above the posterior          claws, but on the
 ventral side of the anus, and on these being compressed, two streams
 of minute rod-like bodies, with movements        so gentle as to be scarcely
 visible, will be seen to issue, one from each papilla.      Nothing similar
 has ever been observed in the female; nor has any other sort               of
 spermatozoa ever been met with.           These   male organs have never
 been described before.
    The author then proceeds to describe and <U+FB01>gure the two sorts of
 eggs in their earlier stages, which have not yet been mentioned by
 any naturalist.     The ephippial eggs differ from the agamic in their
 determinate position and number.          As a general rule, that is to say,
 in  seventeen  cases out of twenty-three, the author has remarked that
 ephippial eggs commence and are developed to a certain point.
    The development is     as follows.    One of the ovarian cells, always
at the posterior part    of the ovary, swells a little, and becomes a ger
minal vesicle; round it are deposited a number of brownish granules,
while the other cells which may at <U+FB01>rst have existed in the same
ovarian mass cease to be visible.       The deposition of dark granules,
in thirty-seven    cases out of forty, after proceeding to   a certain  point,
ceased,    and the embryo     egg   gradually  disappeared.    In  the other
three cases it increased, and at length formed a dark mass on each
side   of the intestinal canal.    The author in two     cases observed the
ephippial eggs    pass from the ovary into the receptacle.
    The ephippium has been described by Strauss with considerable
accuracy, but he has been more or less misunderstood by all subse
quent writers on the subject, and no one has explained the homo
logies or connexions of the inner        valve.   The ephippium      itself is

                                           853
a   locally altered portion       of the carapace;          the outer valve of the
ephippium being          a part  of the outer layer of the epidermis, and
the inner valve the corresponding part of the inner layer.                         In con
sequence of this arra<U+FB02>gement, the inner valve of the ephippium,
containing the ephippial          eggs,    is not attached by the hinge to the
outer valve, as has been generally stated, but actually lies at <U+FB01>rst in
the    receptacle     formed    by the new        carapace.        The ephippium          is
cast   with the rest of the skin, from which however it soon                     becomes
detached, and continues to fonn an e<U+FB01>icicnt                  protection     to the eggs
until they are hatched.             These eggs probably require to be fer
tilized, but this fact is not completely proved.                        With one ex
ception, wbenever the author            observed ephippin, he could also <U+FB01>nd
males; and, generally speaking, the numbers of each                      ‘were     in pro
portion to       one   another.     Impregnation is not, however, absolutely
necessary to the production            of ephippia,    as the author        has now in
his possession three ephippia,            formed by isolated females.                It  re
mains to be seen whether young will be developed from these or not.
     The early    stages   of the agamic egg are very similar to those of the
 ephippial     egg,  and consist of the enlargement, in the front part of the
 ovary, of    one   of the ovarian cells, which then              becomes    a  germinal
 vesicle, and the deposition round it           of granules, with the addition in
 this   case  of oil-globules.     This process continues, the other two or
 three cells which may haveexisted in the same ovarian mass gradu
 ally disappear, and there is thus formed an egg-like                  mass,   consisting
 of   a germinal       vesicle,  minute      dark   granules, and large oil-glo
 bules.      When     the  growth    is  nearly completed, the vitelline mem
 brane is added.         This is at  first  very delicate, but after deposition in
 the receptacle soon becomes hard.              The ovarian        eggs of Dap<U+FB01>nia,       as
 well as those       of Cypric, never contain round              masses   like those of
 Apkie and Muaca;            but  after their entry into the receptacle, yolk
 masses are found, homologous           with those present at the corresponding
 periods in P/cryganea*.            The eggs when laid are about 7%-3-6 of an
 inch in diameter; they gradually become                 -,-3-8-6,  when the vitelline
 membrane splits and falls off, and the young animal is hatched.                        Far,
  however, from resembling its parent at this time, the young Daphnia
     * The round balls described by Herold in the ovarian eggs of         Bomb;/.2‘,  appear
  to be of a different nature, and homologous      with the Nahrungsdotter mentioned
  by Carus in spiders’ eggs and   the oil-globules of Daphnia.

 is a spherical       bag, inside which     the formation       and development       of
 the new organs is rapidly progressing*.                 Instead therefore of under
  going no metamorphosis,          the young Daphnia only assumes            the well
  known characters of the genus after the <U+FB01>rstlshanges                 of skin.    The
  author    proceeds to compare this phenomenon                 with   a similar   one
  observed by       Mr. Spence Bate in Gammarus, by Prof. Huxley in
 Mg/sis, by Dr. Cohn in Sphzeroplea, in many Annelids, and in the
 interesting entozoon Monastomum mutabile.                   The young Daphnia at
 tains a length of ‘O25 inch before        it leaves   the receptacle of the mother,
 but the length         of time during which it remains therein varies              ac
 cording to the temperature.            The author has never met with an            ex
 ception to the rule noticed by preceding writers, that unisexuality                  is
 characteristic of an agamic brood.
     It  follows from these observations,           that the self-fertile   Daphniae
 are certainly       true females, and that the reproductive            bodies more
 nearly resemble eggs than gemmse              in their origin and development.
 Hereafter, however, it may be convenient to give a separate name to
 those egg-like bodies, which are fertile without impregnation, but for
 the present they must be called eggs.
     The author then gives        a  list of the instances of Parthenogenesis
 which,      so   far   as  he knows, are recorded among the Articulata.
 Finally,    he expresses    the belief that the careful consideration of these
 cases, and     of the facts now recorded       as to Daphnia, and the still more
 wonderful observations recently detailed by Siebold in regard to                Apis
 (if these    latter are con<U+FB01>rmed), must surely remove all lingering doubts
 as to the identity between eggs and            buds; and remarks, that       if Prof.

 Huxley’s de<U+FB01>nition of “individua                and “zooid” is to be adopted,
it will be impossible to assert of any Daphnia or Moth, whether it is
the one or the other, and the hive-bee will have to be considered as
an hermaphrodite,          a species without male individuals.
    Under      these circumstances,     the author      suggests that it would      be
more convenient to continue, as heretofore, to call the individual                   of
any species that which is individualized,             even though   in this  case the
individuals      of   one species  will not always      be homologous     with those
of another.
   *  It is worthy of notice, that the back fold indicating the divisions between the
head and body is opposite the line between the mandibles and the <U+FB01>rst pair of
 maxilla, which latter appear therefore to belong to the body, a Zaddach also
 asserts, and not to the head.

           the Thermal Effects of stretching Solid Bodies.”                                              By     J.   P.
          Jonas, F.R.S.                      Received             January 29, 1857.
   The experiments on the                           above subjects were made with a thermo
 multiplier placed in the vacuum of                                an air-pump.           Its sensibility        was
such that with the junction antimony and bismuth, a thermometric
effect         not greater than               H!“       of   a degree Centigrade              could be esti
mated.              In     determining the themio-electric                       position   of the metals, it
was necessary to increase the resistance                                 of the instrument         a hundred
fold, by placing in the circuit a coil of <U+FB01>ne wire.                                       In thermo-electric
arrangement steel was found to be nearer copper than iron was.                                                       By
hardening, steel was raised almost to the place of copper.                                           Cast iron
was found to surpass copper; so that the junction cast iron and
copper is reverse to that of wrought iron and copper, and the
arrangement cast iron and wrought iron is much more powerful than
copper and wrought iron.                            A

value to the arts.
   The experiments on the stretching of solids showed, in the                                             case       of
the metals,           :1   decrease        of temperature when the stretching weight                             was
applied, and a heating effect when the weight was removed.                                               An iron
wire     1?;   of   an inch in diameter was cooled                         1';   of   a   degree   Centigrade
when stretched                    by   a   weight    of 775 lbs.            Similar results          were        ob
tained with cast iron, hard steel,                                copper, and lead.            The thermal
effects were             in all   these cases found to be almost identical                         with those
deduced from Professor Th0ms0n’s                                  theoretical investigation, the par
ticular formula applicable to the case in question being                                        H=             ><Pe,

a reverse action     being   observed  under   certain circumstances      with
india-rubber, suggested to the author experiments to ascertain
whether vulcanized india-rubber stretched by a weight is shortened
 by increase of temperature.      Accordingly, on trial, it was found that
 this material, when stretched by      a weight      capable  of doubling its
 length, has that length diminished     by one-tenth when its temperature
 is raised 50° Centigrade.     This shortening    e<U+FB01>'ect was found to increase

 THE BAKERIAN LECTURE was delivered by MICHAEL FARADAY,
        Esq., F.R.S.,
                        “ On the Relations of Gold and other Metals
        to Light.”
    The Lecturer    gave   an exposition,  illustrated    by experiments,    of
 the substance of a paper presented by him to the Society under the
 above title.   The following is an abstract    :
    The author of this paper hopes that the undulatory theory of
light, when more fully and perfectly developed, may aid in comparing
local actions with those which take place at a distance, and even help
towards the comprehension       of the physical means by which the latter
are carried   on; and with that view he endeavoured, experimentally,
to subject a ray of light to the action of particles, so small in size as
to have an immediate and near relation, not only to the undulations
of light, but  even to the far smaller motions     of the parts of the ether,
which are supposed to produce, by their joint and successive action,
the light-wave.    His hope was, that by choosing particles of a <U+FB01>tting
substance, experimental results might be obtained which, in the hands
of the mathematical philosopher, might aid in perfecting the theory;
 and for this purpose gold was selected, because of its high optical

qualities, shown in its comparative        opacity, whilst possessing a real
transparency;       its high yellow     re<U+FB01>exion   and its true green trans
mission;     its known      action on light in very minute quantity;              its
capability of extreme division; its great gravitating              -force,   which
could be called upon for aid when the metal was in a                state    of  ex
treme division; its elementary character;         the integrity of its metallic
state  ;   the facilities   of testing its   presence    and condition     ;    and,
<U+FB01>nally,    because    known    phenomena seemed       already to indicate        dif
ferences of action on light consequent upon its division.
   The <U+FB01>rst     state  of division or attenuation considered,     was that con
ferred on gold by beating into leaves.      These, with their dimensions and
general characters, are well known.          Beiiig taken up on glass damped
by   breathing or moistening, and then water introduced between the
glass and the gold as a cushion, the gold can be perfectly stretched,
so  that when dry it is <U+FB01>t for optical examination ; or if a diluted solu
tion of cyanide of potassium be inlike manner introduced beneath the
gold,   it can  be more or less attenuated by solution, and then washed
and   dried.     If gold-leaf   thus extended and attached, either to glass,
or plates    of rock-crystal,     or mica, be heated, it gradually loses its
re<U+FB02>ective power and its green colour, and becomes            translucent.      This
change takes place far below the fusing-point               of gold, and at         a
temperature as low as the boiling-point of oil         if continued for several
hours.      When the heat is considerable, the gold-leaf suffers retrac
tion of its parts,     and becomes    perforated by many <U+FB01>ne holes, often
symmetric      in their form and dimension; but when the heat applied
is the lowest competent to produce the change, it does not seem certain
that the effect is due to such retraction; a good microscopic exa
mination     of this point is required.        When    pressure is applied         to
such     decoloured gold by a convex piece           of rock-crystal of short
radius (as half an inch or less), the green colour of the transmitted
ray reappears.        This production of the green colour by pressure can
often be referred to in different states       of gold,   as a proof,    amongst
others, that the metal          is in the metallic    condition.       Silver-leaf
undergoes a like change by heat, at even a lower temperature.
    Division by the Leyden           Dq<U+FB02>agration.--When         a gold     wire is
de<U+FB02>agrated near the surface of glass plates by a strong electric dis
charge, it is dissipated in minute particles, which are deposited on
the glass.      These are seen by the microscope to be of different sizes;
                                                                 2122

                                      358
but by far the greater part are so minute as not to be distinguishable
separately.     The general <U+FB01>lm is of di<U+FB01>'erent colours by transmitted
light, being grey, violet, or green; and often on the central or
nearest part of the discharge, where the heat has been active, is of a
<U+FB01>ne ruby colour.       All   these particles   act with acid and chemical
reagents as gold acts; and there is no reason to believe they are
anything other than metallic gold.          They appear with precisely the
same colours and characters,        whether   the de<U+FB02>agrations    are made  in
 common air, in oxygen, or in hydrogen           ; and whether the deposits
 are formed on glass, rock-crystal,     topaz, or mica.     When heated by
 any ordinary means, the green and grey parts change to a ruby or
 ruby-amethystine     colour,   and that whether      surrounded    by air, or
 vapour   of alcohol or ether.     Even after heating, they adhere only as
 a dust to the plates, except when the temperature applied to those         on
 glass has been very high.      Agate pressure confers the green character
 on the heated deposits, and also, in frequent cases, upon that which
 has not been heated.       All things considered, there can be no reason
 to doubt that    the deposits thus made to vary in the colour         of the
 transmitted   light, consist of pure metallic gold.
    Thin <U+FB01>lms    of G0ld.—If     a very weak solution    of chloride of gold,
 free from excess of acid, and containing about 1% grain of metal to
 2 or 3 pints of water, he placed in avery clean glass or glazed vessel,
 in  a quiet place, and then two or three small particles      of phosphorus
 be  laid <U+FB02>oating on the surface, and the whole covered over and left
 for twelve or more hours, the gold will be reduced, covering the
 whole of the surface with a <U+FB01>lm, thicker near the phosphorus than
 at other parts.     This <U+FB01>lm may     be raised from   the <U+FB02>uid by plates    of
 glass, and washed and dried on the plates, and is then ready for ex
 amination.      The thinner parts of such       a <U+FB01>lm are scarcely visible,
 either by re<U+FB02>ected or transmitted light; the transition to thicker
 parts is gradual, the thickest _being opaque, and their re<U+FB02>exion that
 of  dense  gold.    The colour bytransmitted light varies, being grey,
 green, or dull violet.     The <U+FB01>lms are porous, and act as pure gold,
 resisting all the agents which metallic gold resists.         When heated,
 the transmitted     colour   changes towards amethyst and ruby ; and
 then the effect of pressure in producing a green colour is in many
 cases very remarkable,—even        a touch with a card or the <U+FB01>nger being
  able to cause the change.

                                        359
     Gold _<U+FB02>aida.—-Whilst the particles of phosphorus are producing a
<U+FB01>lm on the surface, it frequently happens that streams of a red colour
descend from them through the <U+FB02>uid; and                if  the phosphorus      be sub
merged, and left for twenty-four        or forty-eight hours, this red product
is easily and abundantly        obtained.      If   the gold solution       be placed
in a very clean bottle, and then a few drops                 of a solution of phos
phorus in ether be added, and the whole agitated from time to time,
the ruby <U+FB02>uid is obtained in a shorter period.                  This <U+FB02>uid is apt to
change in colour, becoming          amethystine, violet, purple, and <U+FB01>nally
 blue; impurities of certain kinds in very small quantities cause this
 change. It is hardly possible to clean a vessel so well that the <U+FB01>rst por
 tion put into it does not alter.    Most saline bodies produce the change ;
 a   trace  of  common salt readily makes it manifest.                 That all these
 <U+FB02>uids are coloured by diffused particles is shown by the circumstance,
 that on being left for a shorter           or longer time, the particles sink,
 forming a coloured stratum of deposit            ;  many months, however, are
 required     for  even the partial   separation      of the <U+FB01>ner ruby particles.
 When a light is looked at through the <U+FB02>uid, the latter appears trans
 parent    ; but when the    eye is on the illuminated           side, then the <U+FB02>uid
 is seen opalescent.        If a cone   of sun-rays be thrown by a lens into
  the <U+FB02>uid, the illumination     of the particles within the cone shows their
  presence as undissolved bodies.          It is believed that all the particles
  being metallic gold, the ruby are in the <U+FB01>nest state                 of division, the
  blue in a more aggregated condition.                Though the ruby particles,
  whilst freely diffused,    are  easily changed in colour, and as it is sup
  posed by aggregation, still they may in some degree be separated by
  a   <U+FB01>lter; for on passing the <U+FB02>uid several times through               a paper <U+FB01>lter,
   the latter associates much of the rubifying substance with itself, and
   becomes    of a  rose colour; it may then be well washed and dried, and
   contains the ruby particles located, as it is believed, and prevented
   by their    attachment    to the    paper-<U+FB01>bres        from undergoing        mutual
   aggregation.       In this state their character is not altered from ruby
                                                                                        '
   to blue by salt or acids; they resist those chemical agents which are
   resisted by gold, but are dissolved by chlorine, cyanides and the other
   substances     capable of acting     on gold.        Heated      either in oxygen,
    hydrogen, or air, no change of tint or quality is induced at such tem
    peratures as the paper can bear      ;  or, as far as can be judged, at any
    higher temperature.

                                            , 360
        A ruby   glass, coloured by gold, is well known.         This is considered
    by the author as analogous to the ruby <U+FB02>uid just spoken of, being a
     diffusion of gold particles through vitreous matter.            The ruby <U+FB02>uid
     by association with jelly is rendered much more permanent                  than
     before  ; and then it may by a little warmth be had in the <U+FB02>uid state,
    or by cooling     as a tremulous     jelly, or by desiccation   as a hard   ruby
    solid, presenting     all the transitions      between the gold <U+FB02>uid and the
    ruby glass.      By soaking the dried jelly and then warming it with
    water, these    transitions may be passed through in the reverse di
    rection, and so on, any number of times.
        The relations of gold (and other metals) to polarized light are of
    the following nature.        A leaf of gold inclined at a certain angle across
    a ray   of polarized light (the inclination not being in the plane of
    polarization or at right angles to it), affects it as a thin plate of any
-
    uncrystallized transparent substance would do, i. e. the light appears
    in the analyser, and the plane of polarization is rotated ; or if a leaf
    of gold be held in an inclined position across a ray of unpolarized
   light, the beam is polarized as it would have been in passing through
   a like inclined plate of uncrystallized transparent matter.             The gold
   greened by heating or pressure, when thus examined, does not appear
   to have acquired any particular tension or structure.                Sulphide  of
   carbon and crown-glass are optically so near each other, that a plate
   of the latter immersed in the former is neutralized; and though
   placed in an inclined position to a ray of light, either polarized or
   not, does not then affect         it;   but gold (and all metals) is still far
   above either of these.        Hence the gold <U+FB01>lms obtained by phosphorus,
   when attached to glass, could be examined, and were found to have
   the optical properties of leaf-gold         ; the effect having no reference to
  the thickness of the <U+FB01>lm, but being most perfect in the thinner <U+FB01>lms
  because they were       in a more regular and perfect condition.        It should
  be remembered that these <U+FB01>lms are not continuous                layers like coats
  of varnish or <U+FB02>uid, but easily pervious to vapours.              In like  manner
  the deposits of gold (and other metals) obtained by electric de<U+FB02>agra
  tions, were examined and found to have the same marked qualities
  in a high degree;          places where the <U+FB01>lm was scarcely visible on the
  glass, instantly     showing the presence of the gold by their action on
  the polarized      ray.     In the same manner the very thin and almost
   invisible <U+FB01>lms, deposited occasionally on the sides of the vessels con

                                    361
taining  the gold <U+FB02>uids, showed themselves as gold.         The thinnest
layer  of the <U+FB02>uid itself, however rich in particles, held between two
plates of glass, acted no otherwise than a layer of water.     It appears
by the de<U+FB02>agrations that the particles of gold must be deposited in a
plane, and then, though      discontinuous,  they act in the manner of
continuous   <U+FB01>lms of ordinary uncrystallized   transparent bodies.
   As to the quantity of gold in the different <U+FB01>lms or solutions, it
can at present    only be said that it is very small.     Suppose that a
leaf  of gold, which weighs about 0'2 of a grain, and will cover a
base   of nearly 10 square inches, were diffused through a column
having   that  base,  and 2'7 inches in height,    it would give a ruby
<U+FB02>uid equal in depth    of tint to  a  good red rose; the volume of the
gold present being about the                  of the volume of the <U+FB02>uid;
                                 mlmth part
another result gave   0'01 of a grain of gold in a cubic inch of <U+FB02>uid.
These <U+FB01>ne di<U+FB02>'used    particles have not as yet been distinguished     by
any microscopic    power applied to them.

     The following communications were read          ;—
 I. “ On    the Photography     of the Moon.”    By Wuuslu Caooxss,
        Esq.     Communicated by Professor Sruuss, Sec. R.S. Re
        ceived December      l6, 1856.
    The subject of lunar photography is one which has engaged the
 attention of scienti<U+FB01>c men almost from the <U+FB01>rst announcement of the
 possibility of <U+FB01>xing the images in the camera. Owing to the extreme
 difficulty of satisfying all the conditions of the problem to be solved,
 there are few good photographs        of the moon yet in existence. It
 was my good fortune in the autumn of 1855 to obtain several ex
 cellent pictures of this kind, and since these form the starting-point
of the work which, by the assistance of        a grant from the Donation
 Fund of the Royal Society,      I  have been pursuing during the greater
 part  of the last year, a detailed account of the means employed for
their production will not, I think, be considered out of place here.
    The telescope in which these pictures were taken is the magni<U+FB01>
cent equatorial at the Liverpool Observatory.          This, together with
all the resources    of the establishment, was placed at my disposal by
my kind friend Mr. Hartnup, to whom it is but due to state, that,
were it not for the invaluable assistance afforded me by his sterling
advice as well as steady hand, the results would not have been worth
keeping.
   The mounting of the equatorial is quite unique; the polar axis and
telescope together weigh about <U+FB01>ve tons, and whilst all parts are so
truly and smoothly <U+FB01>tted that this enormous mass is moved equato
rially by means of a small water-mill with such marvellous accuracy,
    voL.   vnr.                                             2 r

that a star viewed through it appears absolutely stationary, its <U+FB01>rm
ness is such that          a hard     blow against the side merely produces a
scarcely       perceptible     momentary         de<U+FB02>ection.  The object-glass is 8
inches in diameter, and has               a   sidereal focus of l2'5 feet—-the dia
meter       of the moon’s image in this focus being about 1'35 inch.
     The     eyepiece    was removed, and in its place the body                  of   a small
camera was attached, so that the moon’s image might fall upon the
ground        glass or sensitive <U+FB01>lm in the usual manner.                   Much labour
had been saved me in <U+FB01>nding the true actinic focus, by several pho
tographers        of Liverpool,       who were working for some                 time on the
same subject when the             British Association met in that city in 1854.
They found that the object-glass had been over-corrected                              for the
actinic rays—the plate being required to be placed at a distance                            of
0'8 of       an inch    beyond the optical focus: a few experiments were
su<U+FB02>icient to enable me to verify this result.
  During the time above referred to, and frequently since, Mr. Hart
nup had taken many hundreds of pictures with chemicals recom
mended by various persons, but had not succeeded                      in obtaining    a good
negative at all, and not even a positive with a less exposure than
from half a minute to a minute.                    As    I   succeeded in taking dense
negatives in about four seconds, with the temperature                        of the room
below freezing          and the moon at a considerable distance from                       the
meridian,       and as    I   attribute   the greater sensitiveness which              I   ob
tained to the great purity of the materials                     I   employed,    I   think it
right to give, after the mechanical arrangements                       are described,      an
account of the way in which these were prepared.
     The clockwork movement was only su<U+FB02>icient to follow the moon
approximately         when on the meridian, but as the pictures were nearly
all taken when          she was some distance past the meridian,                  and when
consequently the declination and atmospheric refraction were changing
rapidly, it      was necessary, notwithstanding               the short    time required
to take the pictures,            tofor the imperfect motion of the
                                      correct
telescope.  This was done by means of slow-motion screws attached
to the right ascension and declination circles, which are each 4 feet
in diameter.         The <U+FB01>nder had an         eyepiece   with   a power   of 200 applied
to   it,   having cross wires in its <U+FB01>eld.
     The     modus    operandi   of taking the picture was as follows :—The
telescope having been          moved until the moon’s image was in the centre

                                               365
of the focusing glass, the water-mill                     was     turned on and the dark
slide containing          the sensitive collodion plate was substituted for the
ground glass.            Mr. Hartnup then tool: his station at the <U+FB01>nder, and,
with a tangent rod in each hand, by a steady and continuous move
ment, kept the point             of intersection of the cross wires stationary on
one spot on the moon's surface.
    When the motion            was most perfectly neutralized,                     I uncovered the
sensitive plate at a given signal and exposed                        it,   counting the seconds
by   means      of
               loud-ticking chronometer
                     a
                                         my side.
                                                            by
    From the ease with which on my <U+FB01>rst attempt   could keep the               I
cross wires         of the <U+FB01>nder <U+FB01>xed on one point of the moon                                by   means
of the tangent rods,          I   con<U+FB01>dently     believe that with the well-tutored
hands and consummate skill which guided this noble instrument, the
moon’s image was as motionless on the collodion                                  plate as     it   could
have been were           ita   terrestrial object.
    The negatives which           I   obtained       by   these      means were exquisitely
beautiful,      and so minute that        I    could not obtain paper with                     a    suffi
ciently <U+FB01>ne surface whereon to print copies which would do them
justice. It was evident that they would bear magnifying several
diameters and still remain sharply de<U+FB01>ned.                           The       expense    of carrying
out this design here stopped me, when                           by   the kind advice of Pro
fessor Wheatstone         I    applied to the Royal Society, whose muni<U+FB01>ccucc
has so frequently been the cause               of bringing           to    a   successful tcnnina
tion investigations of the highest importance.
    A      half-plate    photographic      combination            of       lenses,   by      Ross, was
screwed the reverse way into              a    large sliding camera body 10 inches
high by        11    inches wide, and capable             of sliding from                18 inches to
3   feet   long.     At the end of the sliding body opposite to the                           lens, was
a   groove to admit either            a   focusing        glass or         a   dark slide for the
sensitive plate.          A    smaller camera body was screwed into the other
endof the brasswork of the lens, having also     groove in front to        a
admit of sliding box capable of holding the small negatives. A re
               a
<U+FB02>ector was placed in front of all, so arranged as to move in altitude
round      a   centre, and, being <U+FB01>xed in any required position, to re<U+FB02>ect
the diffused light            of the sky through the negative and lens parallel
with the axis of the latter.
    Preliminary trials showed             me    that there           was no good gained by
magnifying the small pictures more than about 20 times,                                        as after
                                                                                2    F   2

     that the individual parts begin to get confused and indistinct;                this
     magnifying cannot, however, be effected at once.                In the small nega
     tives the lights and shades are the reverse of what they are in nature,
     consequently a print on paper therefrom               gives the light and shade
     correct.     A   photographic      copy of a negative, however, produces a
     positive by transmitted       light, and      .a print from this would have the
     shadows light and the light parts dark            ;  consequently, in magnifying
     a negative with the                  of still producing a negative, an inter
                              intention
     mediate transmitted positive must <U+FB01>rst be taken, and this in its turn
     magni<U+FB01>ed, when it will produce a negative.
         The relative distances of the negative and focusing glass from the
     intermediate lens were so adjusted, that an image of the negative,
     enlarged to about two diameters, was thrown upon the ground glass,
     care   being taken that the light from the sky was re<U+FB02>ected parallel
     through the centres of the negative and lens by means of the mirror.
     The aperture of the lens was then stopped down to half an inch by
     means     of a diaphragm,     and the focus most carefully            obtained by
     sliding the end of the large camera in or out.               I  found it necessary
     to verify this    by experimental        trials at different distances on each
    side of the observed focus, as it was dif<U+FB01>cult to judge accurately with
    the eye on the ground glass, owing to the roughness of the latter and
    the feebleness     of the light.        _
        A  picture, or rather many pictures, were             now taken, and the one
    which by transmitted light most truthfully resembled a paper print
    from the small negative was reserved for further magnifying.                   This
    was effected absolutely in the same manner as the former                : the nega-  -
    tive being removed and the positive being placed in its stead, a further
    magnifying     gave a large-sized negative.
        Although this process       seems very simple,       it is impossible to esti
   mate the di<U+FB01>iculties, unless by an actual repetition of the experiment,
   which     I  had to overcome before arriving at the beautiful result which
   I   have the honour to lay before the Society.               The double copying
   had a tendency to slightly exaggerate the effect of light and shade,
   and this could only be obviated by exposing the plates for such a
   time, that with the feeble         light    at my command        it was verging  on
   decomposition;       particles of dust, too, seemed most pertinaciously           to
   <U+FB01>x themselves on the prominent mountains, giving rise to craters
    where none should be; and even my <U+FB01>n'ished pictures are not per
V’

                                       367
fectly free from these faults, although         each  negative is the repre
sentative    of a month's work and upwards of a hundred failures.
   I  doubt if much better photographs of our satellite can be taken
by the way I have pursued.           The future of lunar photography lies
in another direction: the image must not be received on a sensitive‘
plate and this copy submitted          to an after process of magnifying.
Defects quite imperceptible       to the naked eye on the small negatives,
are expanded into great blotches when magni<U+FB01>ed.             In fact, upwards
of   a dozen seemingly equally good negatives         with which    I  started,
have, with but one or two exceptions, shown spots when enlarged.
   The magnifying must         be conducted   simultaneously    with the pho
tographing, either by having the eyepiece on the telescope, or better
still, by having a proper arrangement of lenses to throw a magni<U+FB01>ed
moon image at once on the collodion.              The difficulty of want of
light could not      be any objection, as supposing      the enlarged image
to be equal to those which          I  have now taken, that would        be an
increase    of area  of about twenty times, consequently 20 x       6 seconds,
or  2 minutes,     would represent the average     time of exposure;      a pe
riod which,     even were  it prolonged four or <U+FB01>ve times, would not then
be too severe a     tax upon a steady and skilful hand and eye.
                  Description   of the Photographic    Process.
   The glass employed for taking the original negative of the moon,
was that known as “extra white colour patent plate,” that for the
intermediate     positives and large negatives was ordinary patent plate.
Cleaning the surface, which is an operation of especial importance,
was effected in the following manner.
   The    glasses were dipped into and then well rubbed over        with  a hot
solution of caustic potassa; then, after washing with water, they were
transferred to hot nitric acid (one part strong acid to three of water),
where they were allowed to remain for about half an hour.
   A   piece of soft wash-leather was plentifully rinsed, <U+FB01>rst in a warm
dilute solution of carbonate of       soda, afterwards in clean water, and
then well wrung until all the super<U+FB02>uous water was squeezed out.
The glass plates were taken from the nitric acid and rinsed in abun
dance    of clean water, and then rubbed well on every part with the
damp leather.        This removed most of the super<U+FB01>cial moisture; and
the <U+FB01>nal drying       was  effected by means     of another piece of wash

                                        368
leather, prepared the same as before, but allowed to become perfectly
dry.
    Just previous to using, the plates, held in a pneumatic plate-holder,
had the last polish given to them by briskly rubbing with a warm
piece   of <U+FB01>ne diaper (which had also           been    previously washed in soda
and water, and then well rinsed and dried) until the moisture con
densed from the breath evaporated evenly and uniformly, especially
guarding     against the slightest       contact between the surface           of the
glass and the <U+FB01>ngers.
   The plate     was now held     with its clean side downward until the
collodion    was  about to be poured           on, and every particle        of dust
 (which was easily seen by bringing the source of light, the under
surface of the plate and the eye, nearly in the same line) was gently
wiped off by passing a warm piece of <U+FB01>ne cambric lightly across.
    Care was also taken to have the atmosphere                 of the room    as  free
as   possible from <U+FB02>oating particles,          and the dried collodion       usually
adhering to the neck of the bottle was scrupulously                removed.
   The collodion    was    poured on and the plate rendered sensitive in
the usual way.      As the temperature both of the equatorial and ope
rating rooms was seldom far from the freezing-point,                the great dimi
nution of sensitiveness, which that circumstance would have occa
sioned, was obviated by having the nitrate               of silver bath and     deve
loping solution warmed to about 30° C., and                 also by  slightly warm
ing the plates before using.         The source of light was a <U+FB01>shtail gas
burner in the outer room, and shining close to the orange glass
window of the dark room.
   The soluble paper for the collodion was prepared in the following
manner :—a mixture was made of
                                                    sp. gr.
       Commercial    nitrous acid    . . . . . .  .  1'43       4 <U+FB02>uid ounces.        .

       Sulphuric acid    ............        ..      1-82       8       ,,
   When the temperature of the mixture had cooled down to 50° C.,
one sheet    of Swedish <U+FB01>ltering-paper,          torn up into small pieces, was
completely immersed in the mixture, and allowed to remain therein for
about half an
                 hour. It was then thrown into a large pail of water,
 and the paper removed and placed on _a sieve under a running tap
 for a quarter of an hour; after
                                           washing in very dilute solution of

                                                   369
ammonia and then in plenty                  of water, the paper              was pressed         between
the folds    of  a cloth, and then allowed to dry spontaneously in the
air.
   The collodion was made                 with——
Ether, sp. gr. '7 25 (previously freed from acid by
   recti<U+FB01>cation      from dry caustic potnssa)                   . . . . . .    5 <U+FB02>uid ounces.

   The alcohol and ether                were     mixed together, and then the paper
and   iodide of cadmium were added:                      they dissolved in a few minutes
with a little shaking.             As soon        as the solution was complete,                     it was
allowed    to stand for twenty-four                  hours, and then half of the clear
supernatant      <U+FB02>uid was decanted carefully into a clean well-stoppcrcd
bottle for   use.        I   believe that collodion                prepared in this way will
remain uniform from one year's end to another.
   The nitrate of silver bath                    was    made by          dissolving        1    ounce   of
crystallized    nitrate      of silver, perfectly pure and neutral, in                          2 ounces
of water, then, with constant stirring, adding a solution of 4 grains
of iodide of cadmium in I ounce of water, and a quarter of an ounce
of the above iodized collodion, and water to make up the volume to
10 ounces.       This      was allowed          to stand for a few hours at a tempe
rature   of about     25°     C., and then <U+FB01>ltered from the undissolved iodide
of silver and precipitated paper.                       A glass bath            was     used      in pre
ference to gutta percha, and, as above stated, it was heated to 30° C.
when used.

   This developing solution                  is very slow in its action,                       15   to 20
minutes being frequently required,                      but it ultimately          produces nega
tives  of such vigour and freedom from stains, that                              I much prefer it
to the usual formula.
   The <U+FB01>xing solution employed was the ordinary nearly saturated
solution of hyposulphite of soda. After its employment the pictures

                                      370
 were well and carefully washed in warm water, dried before a <U+FB01>re,
 and, after scratching      the description   or name on a corner, varnished
 with the usual solution       of amber in chloroform.
     The subsequent operation of printing is so easily performed, and
  has been so fully described by persons of more experience than my
  self, that any further allusion to it will be needless.
                                     Appendix.
     Besides the pictures taken in America—-which          are almost valueless
 as moon maps, as the sides are reversed in the copying                from the
 daguerreotype      plate upon which       they were originally taken,—the
 moon has been photographed            by Professor   Phillips, Father Secchi,
 MM.      Bertsch   and Arnauld, several Liverpool          photographers,   and
 Mr. Hartnup and myself.              It  is interesting    and  instructive   to
 compare among themselves the means employed and the time occu
 pied in taking the impression on these several occasions.
     Professor   Phillips’s telescope has     a sidereal focus  of 11 feet, and
 an aperture     of 6%   inches; consequently the brilliancy of the moon’s
 image in its focus is augmented 26 times over what she appears to
the naked eye.          The average time occupied for the collodion plate
 to receive the impression was about 3 minutes.
     Father Secchi’s telescope having        a sidereal focus   of  18 times its
 aperture,    the moon’s image was intensi<U+FB01>ed        378 times, and the time
 required for the impression was an average of         6  minutes.
    M. Porro’s glass of 49 feet sidereal focus and 20 inches aperture,
gave a moon image l2'3 times brighter than she appeared to the
naked      eye, and    the average    time   of taking the picture       was  17
seconds.                                                                 .
    Mr. Hartnup’s      telescope being 12% feet focus and 8 inches aperture,
augments the intensity of the moon’s image at its focus 35'1 times.
The time which was required for the photograph of our satellite to be
taken, on the occasion of the meeting of the British Association
at Liverpool in 1854, was about 2 minutes;               and under the same
circumstances we ourselves succeeded         in obtaining perfect and intense
negatives in 4 seconds.           These, however, were taken under very
unfavourable circumstances, the temperature being below the freezing
point,    and the moon at       a  considerable distance from the meridian,

                                         371
 which necessarily caused both           a diminution of the light and also       a
 diminished sensitiveness of the collodion <U+FB01>lm.
    The rapidity with which           the above pictures were taken may be
 better understood by comparing them with those of terrestrial objects
 under similar circumstances.           According to Herschel‘
     “ The actual illumination of the lunar surface is not much
                                                                          superior
 to that of weathered sandstone rock in full sunshine.                 1 have fre
 quently compared        the moon setting behind the grey perpendicular
 facade of the Table Mountain, illuminated by the sun just risen in
 the opposite quarter of the horizon, when it has been scarcely distin
 guishable in brightness from the rock in contact with it.               The sun
 and moon being nearly at equal altitudes, and the atmosphere                 per
 fectly free from cloud or vapour, its effect is alike on both lumi
 naries.”
    Thus by comparing the Liverpool object-glass as to power with
 our ordinary camera lens, its focal length being nearly 19 times the
 aperture,    and the moon’s        image    being copied by its means in 4
 seconds, we <U+FB01>nd that       it is equivalent to copying sandstone illuminated
 by the sun in 4 seconds with a lens 4% inches focus and a little less
       i
 than inch diaphragm ; or with a compound lens having an aperture
 of one inch, and the       same focal length, in a quarter      of a second.

        By THOMAS WILLIALIS,               M.D., F.L.S., Physician to the
        Swansea      In<U+FB01>rmary.         Communicated by Tuonus BELL,
        Esq.,  F.R.S., P.L.S. &c.           Received December 30, 1856.
                                     (Abstract.)                       s
    In  this paper the author seeks to establish the following general
proposition,    viz. that there prevails throughout the Actiniadae, Echi
nodermata,      Rotifera    and Annelida, a special organ, which, under
different   phases,    subserves different      functions,  which is essentially
identi<U+FB01>able under every modi<U+FB01>cation, reducible to the same type, and
which constitutes the root of the Reproductive system in these fami
lies.    To this special organ he proposes to apply the provisional
                   * Herschc-1's Outlines of Astronomy. page 249.

                                        872
 name    of the “ segmental organ*.”             In   the chambers      which are
 enclosed by the vertical dissepiments          dividing the body of Actinia,
 convoluted    tubular cords     are  contained which support the genera
 tive structures.     It  has not yet been proved whether             the internal
 ends of these tubules open directly into the perivisceral               chamber.
 These cords and their appended structures in the Actiniadaa, consti
 tute the type    of a system of organs the prevalence of which through
 out the Echinodermata,        Rotifera and Annelida can, he believes, he
 clearly and satisfactorily proved.         In  the present memoir, however,
 the author proposes to con<U+FB01>ne his demonstrations               to the anatomical
 varieties which the segmental organ presents in the class Annelizla,
 contenting himself with merely in a passing manner pointing out the
 fact that the several variations of form, structure and number which
 this organ exhibits in the several genera of this class, are represented
 by similar variations in the different genera, especially of the class
 Echinodermata.       He hoped to show that under very numerous appa
rent varieties, the essential unity of the segmental organ within the
indicated limits can be convincingly          established.
     Upon this organ, under different circumstances, there devolve one
or two or     even more functions.         Sometimes      it is used  as a simple
discharge tube, conveying        externally in a direct manner the <U+FB02>uid          of
the general cavity      of the body. This variety is exempli<U+FB01>ed in the
segmental organs which are distributed, in the genera Lumbricus
and Nais, throughout all that part of the body which is situated
posterior    to the Reproductive       band.     In   this latter region two or
more    of these organs    are so modi<U+FB01>ed as to become the basis whereon
is developed the generative structures.
    Here the author enters upon a minute account (illustrated by
<U+FB01>gures) of the history of this organ in I/umbricus and Nais, showing
the changes of outward form which            it undergoes in several    species  of
these genera.
    He points out in this place that the segmental organ, as it occurs
in I/umbricus and Nais, is paralleled by the so-called water-vascular
system    of the Rotifera:    as in the former so      in the latter, the ciliated
tubes communicate openly with the general cavity; in both, the cur
    * While he is convinced that the identity of this organ might readily be traced
 throughout other families of the lower Invertebrata, he will not permit himself at
 present to indulge in any wider generalization than that stated in the text.

                                      878
rent raised by the cilia travels from within outwards; and he eon
tends that the reproductive structures are ingraftcd upon, or deve
loped from one, two or more       of the ciliated tubes in the Rotifera,    as
from the segmental organs of Lumbricau and Naio.
    Arenieola and Terebella form a group in which the segmental
organ deviates in a remarkable        apparent manner from that       of Lum
 bricua and Naia.       It forms a series   of elongated saceuli, which    are
attached to the ventral wall     of the general cavity on either side of the
 median line.      Each sacculus, although single at its distal end, is
divided    at its attached end into two tubular limbs,           one of which
 communicates directly with the exterior, while the other opens imme
diately into the general cavity     of the body.     Through the latter limb
 the ova and sperm-cells are introduced into the perivisceral chamber,
 while in the   reverse direction  the <U+FB02>uid of this chamber is discharged
 externally.     The author has never      been able to     discover how the
 germ- and sperm-cells (respectively in the female and male) escape
 out of the general cavity.       But be trusts that he has given a new
 and satisfactory demonstration      of the mode in which they enter that
 cavity.    The genera Arenicola and Terebella          comprehend    the only
 Annelids in which the germ-elements in the female, and the sperm
 cells in the male, are ushered into, and are required to sojourn for a
 season in the <U+FB02>uid of the general cavity of the body.
    He indicates in this place that the segmental organ of the Sipun
 culidx (amongst the Echinoderms) corresponds both in its structure
 and relations to that    of Arenicola and Terebella, with this difference
 only, that in the latter a special and peculiar development of the
 blood-vascular system occurs around and in the vicinity of the seg
 mental organ, whereas in the Sipunculidse this system scarcely exists
 and never receives any enlargement.          The segmental organs in the
 genus S3/napla stand in an intermediate          position   between those  of
 Holotlmria and those of Sipunculus.             In Synapta one or more
                                                   ‘
 organs remain in the condition of simple            discharge tubes,’ while
 others become developed into the Reproductive           structures.
    The segmental organs of the Hirudinacese are next described.
 The author adheres almost in every detail to the results published by
 him in 1851 in the Transactions       of the British Association, with re
 ference to the reproductive system of this family of Annelids. In the
 present memoir he records the results of new and carefully conducted
 dissections, which prove that in the Common Leech,             the Sea-leech,

                                         374
 and probably in the genus Clepeina,            there is situated an organ on
 either side   of the ventral median line, which is repeated in every ring
 qf the body, and which in this family is the true ovigerous apparatus,
 the testes constituting      a separate   and more medianly disposed series
 of glandular bodies, whose homologies he has not yet satisfactorily
 determined.
                                                ” of
    The so-called “ respiratory sacculus             Duges he now looks upon
 as  the process of the ovario-segmental organ, by which a communica
 tion is established      between the latter and the general cavity       of the
 body, and by which the <U+FB02>uid            of this chamber     escapes  externally.w
 All   the Hirudinaceee are androgynous.
    Under the Nereid group is included in this memoir, the genera
 Nereis, Aricia, Phyllodoce, Nephthys, S3/llis and Nerine. The
 segmental organ in these families is specially described and <U+FB01>gured.
 In   all, the sexes are seated on_separate individuals.        In no single in
 stance is the general cavity rendered subservient to the incubatory
 process.     In all, the general circumference of the organ is lobulated
 and irregular,      entering   the hollow bases of the cirrhi and blended
 most intimately      with the blood-vascular system.
    Glg/cera and Cirrhatulus the author classes together, on account
partly of the similarity of form and structure of the segmental organ,
but especially     because   in both the blood-vascular system is completely
 and entirely wanting, its absence being compensated by the existence
 of  a second order    of pigment-carrying     corpuscles in the cavitary <U+FB02>uid.
These genera are unisexual, and at no time are the germ- and sperm
 elements introduced into the perivisceral chamber.
    In this and the preceding groups the author has not succeeded in
discovering     the mode in which the segmental organ opens into the
general cavity     ;  but from the fact that it has     a looped arrangement,
supported on two tubular limbs,           he is quite convinced that an open
ing into this cavity, for the purpose of giving direct outlet to its con
tents, does really exist.        This conclusion is forti<U+FB01>ed by the analogy
of the form under which the organ exists, in the Nereid group in
general.
    The Nemertine Annelids         are then examined.       The author recalls
the results of his researches as published           in his   ‘Report’ on the
Annelids in 1851.          His renewed investigations have con<U+FB01>rmed the
statements which         he then put forth.       He still contends that what
 M. Quatrefages has described in         these worms as the ovary is a great

                                       375
alimentary caeeum, and that the Reproductive              system consists in a
double series    of segmental organs,      one on either       side of this great
caacum and the ventral median        line; that in this family the      sexes are
seated on separate    individuals; that the reproductive elements at no
time <U+FB01>nd their way into the general cavity ; that in fact these Anne
lids, anomalous only in the disposition of their alimentary system,
conform,    as regards   the type and mode       of repetition of segmental
organs, to the standard offered by the great Nereid group.
   Chlonema Dujardinii,       especially the female, presents an extremely
favourable    opportunity   of observing the looped arrangement of the
segmental organ, and       of proving the fact,    so constantly     seen in the
other families of Annelids, viz. that one limb of the loop is the true?
ovary, or the primary seat      of the ovo-genesis   ;  that the ovules travel
round the curve     of the loop; that they acquire        a considerably     deve
loped size at the other limb, just before they escape externally.               In
 Cklonema the vitelline body of the ova is almost ink-black.                  The
entire extent of the segmental organ is thus rendered perfectly and
easily traceable amid the surrounding       transparent structures.        In this
genus   it does not at present appear that either limb         of the loop opens
into the general cavity.       This type prevails,     as  far   as he knows at
present, throughout the Nereid group; in other words, in these                An
nelids the function of a discharge tube does not appear to be thrown
upon the segmental organ under any circumstances             ;  hence the limited
dimensions    of the general cavity and the highly developed character
of the blood-vascular apparatus.
   The group lastly examined, is that of the Aphroditacem.                On the
reproductive organs of this large, numerous and interesting family,
no single observation     is contained in any work on comparative             ana
tomy that the author is acquainted with. He enters upon a detailed.
account of his own researches.         They have ended in what he would
fain believe to   be a complete solution     of the difficulties in which the
history of the Reproductive or segmental system of this family has
been hitherto shrouded.         This family, without exception, is uni
sexual.     The segmental organs constitute a complete and regularly
branched series, situated, as in all other Annelids, on either side of
the ventral median line.         They embrace, like a gauze-work, the
divertienla   of the alimentary system, with which they correspond in
                                                                     “
number.      They fall under the general designation of the segmental

                                         376
organ," in the feature of their having two limbs, being therefore
looped, although only rudimentarily.            The author then proceeds to
give an account of his studies into the history          of this organ amongst
the grotesque and highly varied species of the genus Polynoé. They
have rendered it certain that throughout the family of the Aphro
ditaceae      there obtains but one type       of segmental organ,          and that
upon      it always are ingrafted the generative structures.
     At    this stage the attempt is made to show           that    the segmental
organs       of the Echinidae,      Asteriadae  and   Holothuriadae         conform,
structurally and functionally,‘ in the most remarkably intimate man
ner with the typical standard exhibited by this organ in the Aphro
Ylitacese.       But between these Echinoderm and Annelidan families the
author attempts to indicate other zoological             a<U+FB02>inities.       He shows,
that, according to his researches amongst the Aphroditaceee,                 there is
no trace whatever to be discovered           of a blood-vascular       system.    In
this respect they correspond with the Echinidan and Asteridan fami
lies. He shows that in the Aphroditaceae           the general cavity is never,
under any- circumstances,          used as an incubatory      chamber.        In this
point of their generative history the Echinidae and Asteriadae exactly
agree with the Aphroditaceae.
     The author regrets, that, in consequence of the di<U+FB01>iculty of obtain
ing specimens, he is obliged to defer to        a second memoir many special
points      of anatomical structure and physiological relations, the deter
mination of which he still feels to be necessary to the complete
history of the segmental organ in the Annulose and Radiated classes.
     The paper is illustrated by numerous drawings.

examples of a rare conformation        of the female sexual organs, in which
the two ovaria have descended through the inguinal canals and have
become permanently lodged in the upper part            of the external labia;
and   in both of them the most careful and repeated physical examina
tion has failed to detect either uterus or vagina.           I  should hardly,
however, have ventured to bring them before the Society simply as
examples      of faulty conformation—because, although rare, yet they
have been observed *—had not the <U+FB01>rst of the two cases presented
the interesting physiological peculiarity of a spontaneous periodical
increase of one or other of the ovaria, followed by its gradual reduc
tion, thus supplying direct evidence of an ovarian menstrual act.
    The subject of the <U+FB01>rst     case applied   to me in September 1851 for
advice on account       of never having menstruated.         She was nineteen
years   of  age,  of a tall <U+FB01>gure, symmetrical frame, well-expanded pelvis,
and womanly aspect, hearing all the marks of a full completion of the
physical changes of puberty; and her general health, though not
robust, was fairly good.        She was one of a family of <U+FB01>ve children,
and her sisters had menstruated between <U+FB01>fteen and sixteen years            of
           * Vida Deneux, “ Recherches sur la Hernie dc l'Ovaire," 1813.

                                         378
  age.     The principal point which was elicited from her history in
  connexion with her complaint was,          that,  eighteen months before, a
  swelling had somewhat suddenly appeared on the right side               of the
  external organs, which had caused her some pain for a few days, and
  had then disappeared.          In four or <U+FB01>ve months      a similar   swelling
  again appeared, but        was   attended with so much      suffering   that  a
  medical man was consulted, who took it for an abscess            and ordered
 it to be poulticed.       Again it passed away, again to recur at the end
  of two months ; and so it had gone on at irregular intervals until the
 time of her seeing me, whenthe pain of a renewed attack of unusual
  severity had occasioned her some alarm..         On examination,    a swelling
  the size of a goose-egg was found to extend between the external ab
  dominal ring and the centre of the labium on the right side, which
  was very tense and <U+FB01>rm to the touch;          and the cellular   tissue, skin,
  and mucous membrane          of the labium were    cedematons  and in<U+FB02>amed.
  It  was painful, but by no means so painful as a labial abscess, which
 in its general aspect it resembled; and there was but little febrile
 disturbance.        A more critical examination detected the presence of a
 solid body of an oval shape within the tissue of the labium, which
 proved to be the ovarium, whose enlargement had so compressed the
 surrounding      tissues as to swell and in<U+FB02>ame them.       On the opposite
 side there was another oval body, the size         of a walnut, which passed
just beyond the outer ring, but readily slipped into the canal. This
 was the left ovary in a quiescent state.          The external sexual parts
 were normally formed; but the ostium vaginae             was closed, a slight
 indentation in the median line alone marking its position.            Frequent
careful physical examinations failed to detect any trace of a vagina
or uterus, and the conclusion arrived at was that these central pelvic
organs had not been developed.             The mammary glands were fully
formed.
     I have had repeated opportunities       during the six years which have
intervened since <U+FB01>rst the case came before me,        of examining the organs
both during the periods        of ovarian excitement and during the inter
vals.      For nearly two years, however, I completely lost sight of her,
when     I  learned to my amazement, that, in spite of my strong admo
nition both to her mother and herself that she should lead a single
life, she had married.        For some time past I have seen her more fre.
 quently, and have watched the recurrence of the ovarian swellings.

                                                   379
   For the <U+FB01>rst three years the right ovarium                       was exclusively enlarged,
and the intervals were not so regularly marked, varying between three
and six weeks;          excepting        for the <U+FB01>rst year, when they were much
longer, occasionally          extending         to three months.              For the last two
years the left ovarium                 has been far more frequently                   affected, the
right remaining quiescent;                occasionally both are painful and tumid,
but even then one more than the other.                         The intervals        are now pretty
regularly    three weeks.              The acute in<U+FB02>ammatory                  symptoms             which
accompanied the onset             of    these   swellings have long since ceased to
recur, which is obviously due to the loose                          state   of the tissues from
repeated stretching, so that the swollen organ is no longer compressed.
  The accession of           a menstrual time is sometimes suddenly felt.                             She
will go to bed well, and in the morning the ovary will be swollen:
more commonly, however, it is very gradual, augmenting in volume
for four days, then remaining stationary for three days, and then gra
dually declining         ;   the whole process, before the ovary is reduced,
generally lasting ten or twelve days.                     On separating the ovary, when
at its height of swelling, from the tissues surrounding                              it,    it   appears
scarcely,   if   at all, less than double its usual volume;                           its outline         is
clearly de<U+FB01>ned, and          it   is   plain that the whole, and not merely                      a   part,
of the organ       is   involved.           There   is   no suffering         worthy of notice                 _
during the time: the swelling      tender  pressed; and tender, too,
                                              is           if
in the act of sitting down or rising up; but she walks about as usual
without distress, and there              is   but little lumbar or hypogastric                       pain.
Neither     are    there any manifest sympathies                         excited,    either       of the
mammary glands or other organs.                          Nor   is   there any vicarious <U+FB02>ux,
either   of blood or any secretion, with the exception of an                                 excess       of
saliva, but this not in any large <U+FB02>ow.                     The ovary alone appeared to
be engaged in this periodical                 act, which       it   is   not too much to sup
pose,    in accordance with modern                   physiological           views, would            have
been attended       with     a    <U+FB02>ux of blood, had not the organs which nor
mally supply       it   been absent.
   But while this may              be said to represent                  the usual course of a
period, yet the volume of the ovary, and the length of time                                 it   remains
swollen,    is   subject to occasional variation; sometimes being much less
tumid, and dying away in                a   shorter time.
  The repeated attempts at sexual union have only had the                                        effect   of
somewhat loosening               the tissues around the vulva,                      but the vagina

remains imperforate as before, and is beyond the reach of surgical
remedy.        It may be added, that the subject    of this history recognizes
an increase     of sexual feeling at and soon after the periods of enlarge
ment    of the ovary.
     The second      case was that of a young woman who had attained the
 age   of twenty without having menstruated.         She was a tall, strumous
 looking person, in weak health.             There had not     been  any well
 marked efforts at menstruation,          but she had suffered slightly from
 lumbar pain.         The  mammee   were well developed.       The pelvis was
 fairly formed.        On examination   I  found the two ovaria just appear
 ing beyond the external abdominal rings, and readily returning by
 pressure into their respective inguinal canals.         They were of equal
 size and similar shape, being ovoid bodies about the size of small
 chestnuts.       They were not tender when touched, although organi
 cally sensitive, and      she had   never experienced pain in them.       The
 external sexual organs were somewhat less perfectly developed than
 usual; the vaginal ori<U+FB01>ce was closed, and no trace of a canal or
 uterus could be detected by exploration with a catheter in the blad
 der and the <U+FB01>nger in the rectum.            These organs, as in the former
 case,   were absent.       During the time I saw the patient, which was
 only for two months, the ovaria did not enlarge, although her general
  health improved.

                                               Anatomy and Physiology of
        Nautilus.”         By JOHN D. MACDONALD, Esq., Assistant
         Surgeon      R.N. Communicated by Captain DENHAM, R.N.,
        F.R.S.        Received January 13, 1857.
     Both Professors Owen and Valenciennes noticed that the hollow
  subocular process of their specimens of Nautilus Pompilius was not
  tentaculif_e_rous,   and I may be permitted to say that this was also true
  of several ‘examples of Nautilus Pompilius, and one of N. macrom
 phalus, examined by me. 'But there is still another matter worthy
  of remark with reference to this process, namely, thatits cavity may
  be traced downwards, inwards, and a little forwards, to within about
  the twentieth of an inch of the auditory capsule; indeed it would

                                      381
appear    as though provision had been made for the entrance          of sono
 rous waves through a rudimentary        external car.
    There can belittle doubt that the     eye  itself is a modi<U+FB01>ed tentacular
 sheath, so fashioned and endowed as to become the seat          of the special
 sense   of vision; but the subserviency of such         a part to the faculty
of hearing is much more obviously        seen in the subocular process just
 noticed, which holds an intermediate position          between the organ    of
vision and the tentaculiferous sheaths protecting the proper organs of
touch.
    In  a <U+FB01>gure which accompanies       this communication,      the auditory
sac is exposed by an incision      made in the groove between the funnel
lobe and the base     of the tentacular sheaths. The subocular process
is slit open to the bottom of its cavity, so as to show its termination
in close proximity to the ear-sac.       The interior of the tube is lined
with a glandular membrane thrown          into small folds, disposed longi
tudinally, but the exterior     of the process is quite smooth like the rest
of the integument.
    I have often had some little dit<U+FB01>culty in detecting the otolithes       or
otoconia, as the case may have been, in gasteropods long immersed
in spirits or other preservative <U+FB02>uids;      but in a specimen    of N. Pom
pilius, kept for many months in strong gin, although the soft parts
were far from being well preserved,      I was   enabled at the <U+FB01>rst attempt
to remove the contents      of the auditory   sacs, and the minute elliptical
otoconial particles, identical    in character with those      of N. macrom
phalua, were very distinctly seen under the microscope.
    In  a former paper,   I <U+FB01>rst noticed my discovery of simple auditory
capsules in, as   I then supposed, the N. umbilicatus; but I <U+FB01>nd that
I  have incorrectly    named my specimen, for on comparing the shell
with the drawings of the several existing Nautili given in Sowerby’s
‘Thesaurus Conchyliorum,’ it agreed exactly with the <U+FB01>gure of N.
macromphalus.        I am indebted    to my friend     Mr. S. Stutchbury for
the perusal of the work referred to, and my error is su<U+FB01>iciently           ac
counted for by the scantiness      of my own library.
    With reference to the action of the great lateral muscles of Nau
tilus, the following ideas have suggested themselves to my mind.
    As though preparatory to the complete separation of the body of
the Cephalopod      from the shell, which is usually present in the lower
genera, the fasciculi composing the lateral muscles in Nautilus do not
                                                             20.2

                                    382
perforate the mantle, and therefore cannot be directly         <U+FB01>xed into the
shell; they are, however, connected with it through the medium of
thin <U+FB01>lmy layers of a corneous texture, which frequently remain at
tached to the shell after the animal has been removed.             The feeble
hold of those muscles,     even in a very recent state, is thus readily ac
counted for.     Indeed, it is highly probable that the <U+FB01>xity of the body
 of Nautilus during the inhalation and forcible ejection of the respi
ratory currents    is_e<U+FB02>'ected by the   shell-muscles   reacting    upon      one
another, on the principle of a spring purchase, rather than by simple
traction, as illustrated by. the withdrawal    of a gasteropod    within its
retreat, or the closure of the valves    of  a conchifer by the adductor
 muscles.
    This view, which is supported by the foregoing facts, has its princi
 pal basis in the line of direction of the shell-muscles, and the angle at
 which they meet one another, at the root of the funnel-lobe         ;   for the
 outer extremity of each being <U+FB01>xed, it follows that the <U+FB01>rst          effect  of
 the contraction   of the muscular <U+FB01>bres would     be to increase the angle
just noticed;    and this cannot possibly be accomplished, according to
 the recognized laws of muscular action, without tending to throw apart
 the points of origin,    or in other words, exerting outward pressure
 against the internal wall of the shell, and thus, as it were, jamming
 the occupant tightly in its cell.
    The action of the great lateral muscles of Nautilus here supposed,
 affords a remarkable contrast with the mode in which the posterior
 expanded arms of Argonauta embrace the exterior          of its shell, parti
 cularly during the ejection of the expiratory current     ;  while the with
 drawal  of the gasteropod into its   abode,  by the contraction     of   a veri
 table retractor, exhibits the exertion of muscular force in a very differ
 ent direction.
    In regard to the supposition     that Nautilus    macrompkalus is the
male of   N. Pompilius,    I may remark, that, besides my own specimen
 of the former, which proved to be     a female, another, in very excellent
 condition,  lately deposited in the Sydney Museum,          is of the      same
 sex.

                                                                              i
       ceived
    In one of our visits to Moreton Bay, the scan was hauled at More
 ton Island, and amongst the masses of sea-weed, &c. brought up
 with the net,  I  found numerous specimens of a very beautiful        Poly
 zoon,  a small portion    of which I had previously dredged at Port
 Stevens from a depth of 5 or 6 fathoms.
    The Polypidom may be said to have consisted mainly of rooted,
 spreading and plantlike    portions, and short, straight creeping trunks,
 connected at both extremities with the <U+FB01>xed part of the former, so
that the whole presented the appearance of an open lace-work, having
all the transparency    and lustre of glass.
    The trunks and branches       were  nearly   perfectly cylindrical, and
composed of an outer membranous sheath distended with a clear
<U+FB02>uid (which escaped with considerable force when the sheath was
ruptured), and line-like reticulated    vessels  disposed in one plane, so
as to communicate     laterally with the polyp-cells, and divide the axis
longitudinally into equal halves. The more central canals of this
vascular plane combined to form a compound vessel, which opened
into   a spherical   sinus with cellular    parietes at the base    of  each
branch.
    The rami<U+FB01>cation of the Polypidom generally exhibited         a trichoto
mous arrangement, with simple articulations       occurring only where the
branches were given otf.
 .  The cells were clustered in linear   series  on opposite sides of the
branched    axis, oval in shape, corneous in texture, with a terminal
combed aperture, folding inwards by the contraction         of four equidi
stant sets of muscular <U+FB01>bres, which imparted a quadrilateral        <U+FB01>gure to
the opening.
    The polypes were very minute, but exhibited distinctly all the im
portant points of structure observable in those of Vesieularia and
Bowerbanlria,    between which genera this polyzoon would appear to

                                       384
lie.    The ciliated tentacula, like those of       Vesicularia,   are eight in
number, and do not possess the motionless hair-like processes which
project from the back of each in Bowerbankia.
     Although too much importance must not be attached to the actual
number of tentacula surrounding           the oral aperture, the tendency to
multiply those organs must not be altogether forgotten. Thus, while
 there are but eight in Vesicularia, Bowerban/ria densa and Bower
 bankia repens possess respectively ten and twelve.
     Both Bowerban/via and      Vesicularia    agree  in the uniserial and uni
lateral    distribution of the polypes, but in the present instance the
 cells are arranged in linear and bilateral clusters.

                                     (Abstract.)
     During his sojourn among the Feejee Islands, the author devoted
 much time to the anatomical investigation of recent Gasteropoda, with
 the view of discovering such indications         of affinity in the details of
 structure as might serve as a basis for a        natural arrangement of the
 order   ; and the present paper is designed to give a statement of some
 of the results of his researches, in order that the affinities of struc
 ture developed may be fairly examined and taken for what they are
 worth as principles of classi<U+FB01>cation.
     After pointing   out_ objections to the foundation     of primary divisions
 among the Gasteropoda on characters derived from the shell or from
 modi<U+FB01>cations of the respiratory organs, the author observes in respect
  of the value of sexual characters, that when the distinguishing fea
  tures of a class are once satisfactorily determined, and this contains

                                             385
  forms     in which the    sexes are either separate, or combined in the in
  dividuals, no other characters can be of greater importance in esta
  blishing primary divisions.            As   a means    of further subdivision    ac
  cording to natural a<U+FB01>inities, he suggests distinctive characters deriva
  ble  from the auditory sacs and concretions, and from the oral, lingual
 and gastric dental organs.
      In Mollusca,     as in Fishes, the auditory        concretions present them
 selves    in one of two forms, viz. solitary lapilli, usually named otolitlies,
 or groups       of small granules of        a rounded     oval or irregular shape,
 which have been designated               by the term oloeonia.          The lingual
 teeth are either set together on a short and broad               lingual membrane,
 and form      what the author calls        a  lingual pavement, or on       a narrow
 longitudinal band termed lingual‘ ribbon or strap.                The latter usually
 consists     of a median    rachis <U+FB02>anked by two lateral portions or pleura;
 but in some cases       the raclzia, and in others the pleura! are absent, and
 the number       of longitudinal rows of teeth in these divisions may also
 differ   in different genera.        The fore part of the lingual membrane is
 supported       by cartilage,     so curved     and fashioned as to receive the
 lingual sac behind and form a basis to the tongue               itself projecting in
 front.      This lingual cartilage may consist of a           single piece thinned
in the middle line, or        of two or four distinct pieces, similarly arranged
and wrapped          together    by muscle and ligament.            The oral dental
organs or       labial plates    are disposed either      horizontally or laterally.
In    the former case a single plate may occupy the upper               lip, or there
may be two guarding           the aperture       of the mouth, and corresponding
with both upper and lower lip, but the lateral plates are always in
pairs.       Gastric teeth occur in the Aplysiadae and Bullidee.
    After pointing out further differences in the form and arrangement
of the dental apparatus in different genera, the author thus describes
the mode       of development of the lingual teeth. “ The lingual sac at
<U+FB01>rst    appears as a little caacal process appended to the inferior part of
the (esophagus, where          it joins the oral cavity.      In the median line of
the
       <U+FB02>oor
              of this sacculus, a few minute plates disposed in a longitudi
nal row form the rudiment of the future rachis, and the
                                                                          progress of
their development may be            distinctly traced on examining them, seria
tim,    from before backwards, in which direction, as their growth ad
Vances,     they acquire a more perfect form.           The internal row of pleural
plates now makes its appearance, their               development proceeding in a
Billlilar way; and after this follow the others according to their posi

                                                                                 386
        tion, the more internal arising <U+FB01>rst.                                          Thus the whole ribbon of dental
        organs increases in length and breadth by additions made respectively
        to its anterior extremity and sides ; and each transverse row gradually
        moving backwards by the continued development and growth of others
         anterior to             it,   causes elongation                         of the lingual       sac,which only attains
         its perfect state when these processes are at an                                             end.  The idea, there
         fore, that the new teeth are developed from behind forwards                                                             and suc
         cessively brought into use, as in sharks and rays among <U+FB01>shes, does
         not appear to me to be correct.”

         able number of genera grouped together by the characters above re
         ferred to.               Although the author thinks                              it    improbable that any genera
         opposed to each other in those fundamental                                          particulars can be inti

                                        388
      Murex, Triton, and Ranella have always been associated together
  as   members of one family by universal consent, and it must be con
  fessed that the external resemblance between them is very remark
  able   ; but on comparing the lingual and labial dental organs of Triton
  or Ranella with those of Murew, it will be at once perceived that the
  latter genus can have no immediate a<U+FB01>inity with either of the former
  genera.
      The aperture of the proboscis in Murex is transverse, and armed
  with two horizontally arranged dental plates, connected laterally by
  the minute semi-calci<U+FB01>ed cells which line this part. The upper plate
  presents a rough palatal surface, with an anterior encrusted cutting
- border, much resembling that of the crescentic mandible             of Limax
  or   Helix; whereas the dental plates of Triton and Ranella consist
   of oblique rhombic cells identical in character with those of Cyclo
  phorus or Natica, disposed laterally.            Again, on comparing the
  lingual strap of Murew with that of Triton or Ranella, we remark,
   <U+FB01>rst, that each transverse row of the former consists of three mem
  bers, viz. one in the rachis, and one      in each pleura, while   in the two
  latter cases the pleurae present two additional       elements; thus there
  are seven series      of dental plates in the strap. The tongue-strap of
   Murew, moreover, is lengthy like that of Purpura and Ricinula, both
  of which genera       are more closely allied to Mureze   than perhaps any
  others referred to its family.
       The strap of Triton and Ranella, on the other hand,         is compara
   tively much shorter, and singularly enough more nearly approaches
  that     of Pileops-is or Vermetus, not only in general proportions, but
  also in the actual number and con<U+FB01>guration of the dental plates and
  processes.       Now with these facts before us, it will be scarcely worth
  while entering further into the characters of the lingual            dentition
  of Murew,        Triton,  and Ranella, but    the most super<U+FB01>cial      exami
  nation     of the <U+FB01>gures (which accompany the communication)               will
  show that Murew must be separated from its assumed alliance with
  Triton and Ranella, while the close relationship          of the two latter
  genera gains additional support.
      On comparing the lingual dentition of the genus Cg/rtulus with
  that of Tritonidea of Swainson (the Polia of Gray), both are found
   to be naturally allied by characters which very distinctly manifest
   a  family relationship, and Swainson’s genus llluricidea, with        several

                                         389
  others, must     also be referred to this group.          The lengthy triserial
  ribbon  of Cyrtulua, or Tritonidea, for example, exhibits no true or
  immediate    affinity with the comparatively short and septiserial dental
  armature   of Triton or Ranella.            Thus the author is induced to
  dissent from Mr. Gray's view that Tritonidea is allied to Triton, but
  agrees  with him that the      Bueeim'd¢e,  forming an equally characteristic
  natural  family,   are very close at hand.
     The lingual dentition,       and in fact the whole anatomy of Terebra,
  most unequivocally       refer it to the Conida, and not to the Buecinid¢,
 amongst     which it is at present received.
     The author has not been able to detect lingual cartilages of the
 usual character in Coma, Conorbia, or Terebra, but the walls of the
 tongue-sac are stout, tough, and distinctly cartilaginous             in structure;
 indeed   the whole organ, including its armature, very much resembles
 the dental cheek-pouches of some Pteropods.
     The lingual ribbon of Pleurotoma is exceedingly minute, and the
 parietes   of the    sac are    not  of that  dense  and unyielding       character
 which they exhibit in Conua, Conorbis*, and Terebra.                     Moreover,
in Pleurotoma the little lingual membrane is supported by two
rounded masses         of cartilage composed of large spheroidal cells.          The
rachis appears to        be absent altogether,     and there is but a single row
of elongated, slightly curved, and sharp-pointed teeth (differing con
siderably from those of Conua and Terebra) in the pleura.
     The tongue-strap of Mitra, although remarkably short, is triserial
like that of Murez, Purpura, &c.; but the author has invariably
found that in those Mitne in which the sculpturing of the shell was
transverse, the pleural teeth were simple, uncinate, and mobile, while
in those      species   characterized    by a smooth surface or longitudinal
sculpturing, the dental processes were small, straight, and numerous,
arising just within the posterior border of broad basal plates. This
difference is exactly such as exists between the lingual dentition of
the respective groups to which Murez and Tritonidca belong.
     Harpa and Oliva are very closely allied, by the general con<U+FB01>gu
ration of the body and the characters of the lingual dentition, though
it must     be remembered that the tongue-strap            in the former is   so very
     * Several specimens of a recent species of this genus
                                                             (hitherto known only in a
 fossil state) were obtained from depths ranging between 10 and 20 fathoms,
                                                                                      '

 minute, compared with the whole bulk                         of the animal,        as to appear
quite     rudimentary.   The simple lateral uncini, moreover, are only
 distinctly visible towards the posterior extremity of the sac.  Both
these genera seem to be more intimately                             related to Murez and-its
congeners than to the Buccinidre.
   T1-zlphoris     is now, as it would              appear from the characters               of its
shell alone, placed with Cerithium, but the comparison of the internal
anatomy of those genera offers no countenance to their supposed
a<U+FB02>inity    ;   thus,    single spherical         otolithes      occupy     the auditory          sacs
of Triphoris, while those of                ~C'eritIu'u1n     contain otoconia.          The pro
boscis of the former is long and retractile.                        The lingual membrane of
Triphoris besides, though long and ribbon-like, supports                            a   multiserial
pavement  of minute teeth, while that of Cerithium isseptiserial, resem
bling in many particulars the tongue-strap of Pupina and allied forms.
   The Columbellre            deserve      to be elevated to the rank of a family,
distinguished          from the Buccinidw by the unarmed rachis, and curved
versatile pleural teeth of the tongue-strap.
  Although not fully satis<U+FB01>ed of the propriety of separating the
genus Canidea from Columbella, the author thinks there can be
no doubt that Pusiostoma,                   formerly        placed with        the Columbellae,
forms a very distinct genus clearly referable to the Buccinidzc.
  As great difference of opinion has always existed as to the distri
bution of the sexes amongst Gasteropods, so far the author is unable
to vouch for the whole truth of the arrangement above given, but he
thinks that       if   there is anything incongruous in                  it,   the correction     of
errors in that particular would seem to be most likely to restore har
mony and support the truth                  of the system.
   In    the course of his inquiries             the author was impressed with the
fact, that various genera of terrestrial gasteropods, which agree with
each     other as far as regards their respiratory                      organs and mode of
respiration,      differ essentially in their general organization,                       whereas
they are in this respect severally related to <U+FB02>uviatile                             and marine
genera, which are obviously constructed on the same anatomical type.
  In     this way      a    terrestrial    genus, having            few structural      points    of
agreement to connect            it   laterally, as   it     were,    with others of the      same
habit,    forms    a    member        of   a   beautifully      connected natural           series,
traceable from         it   through <U+FB01>uviatile and littoral forms to others which
are altogether marine.

     This Table shows the natural atlinities of four principal divisions of
terrestrial gasteropods, proceeding,            as   it were, in parallel lines, with
out any very obvious lateral connexious, through <U+FB02>uviatile and littoral
forms, conducting to certain marine genera distinguished by this
alliance    from     all others      having   no terrestrial        representatives,          and
being therefore more restrictedly            marine.         It  may be remarked that
 the importance of the characters placed at the head                      of the Table has
 been proved by the comparison               of other anatomical particulars in
 those   genera,      and     so   far their e<U+FB02>iciency         in other     cases     is sub
 stantiated.
     The author adds the following observations on the anatomy of the
 Siphonaria and Amphibola, as hearing on their position in the <U+FB01>rst
 series  of the foregoing Table :—
     “Siphonaria         appears to enjoy the power of breathing                      in both
 air and water with equal facility, and on examination,                        we    <U+FB01>nd the
 respiratory    surface so constituted as to a<U+FB01>'ord a ready explanation                         of
  the fact.     Thus, in connexion           with     a narrow,        combed, or rather
  transversely     plaited    gill, numerous       vessels     ramify extensively, and

                                          392
 anastomose freely upon the roof            of the respiratory chamber.          The
 mouth is armed with lateral labial plates, and the lingual dentition is
 not unlike that of Amphibola, to which genus it is further related by
 the absence of tentacula, and the general con<U+FB01>guration               of its head.
    “Amphibola exhibits a        close relationship  to the Pulmonifera in many
 essential anatomical points, but it has a veritable combed gill, which,
 arising from a deep recess on the left side of the branchial              chamber,
 and thence passing obliquely forwards towards the right side, termi
 nates in a pointed        extremity,    in front of which there is          a small
 glandular     body, probably a renal organ.          The margin of the mantle
 may be traced continuously          round the neck and the base        of the foot,
 being attached in its entire extent, with the exception                 of  a small
 portion which arches over            a narrow     respiratory    opening     on the
 right side of the nape.       The lingual    sac is small,  like  a caecal process
 appended to the antero-inferior         part  of the oesophagus.       The dental
 organs present a pavement          of narrow basal plates with very long and
gently curved cusps.        The teeth of the central series are much larger
than the rest, and exhibit a remarkable conformation             ; thus a rounded
process projects in the middle and several minute denticulations arm
its  base   on either side.        I  have not succeeded in detecting either
lingual cartilages or labial plates in my spirit-preserved specimens,
and but for the support furnished by analogy, I would incline to the
belief that they     are absent    in the present   case.
    “The remark made by Mr. Woodward in his very valuable little
             ‘
work the       Manual of Mollusca,’ that the anomalous genus Amphibola
has an unusually broad tongue armed with teeth similar to those of the
snail, is not quite correct.         The misconception most probably origi
nated in the inspection of a preparation belonging to Mr. Wilton
of Gloucester, and from which Mr. Woodward’s <U+FB01>gure has been
                                                                      ’
taken, as ‘part of the tongue of Amp/zibola avellana                ;   but having
myself    dissected   several specimens       of this very species obtained at
New Zealand,       I am   satis<U+FB01>ed that Mr. Wilton‘s preparation has been
by some accident improperly named.
    “The general        scheme      of the generative system in Amphibola
corresponds very closely with that of Helix, Bulimus and such Pul
monifera.       The ovarium is imbedded in the liver near the summit
of its spiral turns, and       a  small convoluted oviduct leads downwards
and forwards      along its inner or concave side.           The testis lies con

                                         393
siderably in advance of the ovary; the intromittent                   organ forms a
prominence in the <U+FB02>oor of the respiratory chamber, and <U+FB01>nally the
generative ori<U+FB01>ces open on the right side.”

     In this   communication     the author gives a description (illustrated
by <U+FB01>gures) of the remarkable little algal so frequently met with in
the South Paci<U+FB01>c, scattered over the surface of the water in broad
 streaks     and patches     of a pale yellowish-brown tint, and which is
 known under the name of “ Sea Saw-dust.”
     After adverting to the occurrence of a similar phenomenon in other
 parts of the globe, and citing the account given of the Trichodeamium
erythneum of the Red Sea by MM. Evemor Dupont and Montague,

  said to be jointed, but in the former,             although     the <U+FB01>laments     are
  tubular, simple and continuous without actual joints,             a pseudo-jointed
  appearance is presented by the apposition                of the little   masses   of
  contained colouring matter.          Notwithstanding, having submitted the
                     ’
  ‘
    sea    saw-dust     of the Paci<U+FB01>c to microscopic examination on
  several    occasions,   I  was much       inclined    to   believe   that the <U+FB01>la
  ments were actually jointed       ;  and this view is supported by the cir

                                     I
                                       394
 cumstance that an empty tubule, or one in which the parietes may
 be traced continuously without being interrupted by joints or internal
 septa, has never fallen under our notice; besides which the <U+FB01>laments
 are exceedingly   brittle, usually suffering      cleavage in the transverse
 direction.   It, however, undoubtedly belongs to the Oscillatoridse.
    “When the <U+FB01>laments        are <U+FB01>rst removed from the water, they may
 be observed adhering      side by side in little bundles or fasciculi; and
besides the colouring matter, the little cells, or at least the intervals
between the septa, contain globules of air, which su<U+FB01>iciently            account
for their buoyancy; and, moreover, in this respect, although their
abiding place is the open ocean, their habit can scarcely be regarded
as very different from     that of those     species  which <U+FB02>ourish in damp
localities exposed to the atmosphere.
    “The <U+FB01>laments    are all very short     compared with their diameter,
with rounded extremities;        and when immersed some          little time in
fluid  so that  the contained      air-bubbles    make their escape       or are
taken up, the pale colouring        matter appears to <U+FB01>ll the cells com
pletely, and a central portion, a little darker than the rest, may be
distinctly perceived     in each compartment           intersected   by  a very
delicate transverse partition.
   “We     have found this species       off the coast of Australia and in
Moreton_Bay, amongst the Polynesian Islands, and on two separate
occasions oil’ the Loyalty Group, in nearly the same geographical
position.”

      The following communication was read :—
  “ On what       the Colonial   Magnetic      Observatories have accom
         plished.”      By Major-General SABINE, R.A., Treas. and
         V.P.R.S.     Received February 26, 1857.
     It  hasbeen suggested to me, that a brief review of what has been
  accomplished by the Colonial Magnetic Observatories, instituted on
  the joint recommendation      of the Royal Society and British Associa
  tion, would    be acceptable;   and that the o<U+FB01>icer who has been en
  trusted with the superintendence of these establishments is the person
  from whom      such a review may most properly be expected.           Fully
  assenting to both propositions,    I  have readily undertaken the task;
  and have availed myself of the occasion to add a few remarks and
  suggestions on the measures which appear to be required for the
  further prosecution of the objects for which the observatories were
  recommended.
     The magnetic investigations designed to be carried into execution
  by the Colonial Observatories recommended by the Royal Society
  embraced a much wider scope        than had been contemplated       by any
  previous institutions,   or than had been provided for by the arrange
  ments or instrumental      means of any then existing establishment,
   whether national or private.      Not,   as previously,  limited to obser
  vations of a single element (the Declination),—or combining at the
  most one only of the components of the magnetic force,—the in
  structions of the Royal Society, and the instrumental       means prepared
  under its direction, provided for the examination, inevery branch        of
  detail, of each of the three elements which, taken in combination,
  represent, not partially but completely, the whole of the magnetic
  affections experienced at the surface of the globe, classed under the
  several heads of absolute      values, secular    changes, and variations
  either periodical    or occasional,—and     proceeding   from causes either
  internal or external.     To meet the requirements of inductive reason
  ing, it was needful that the results to be obtained should comprehend
  all particulars   under these   several heads, attainable     by an experi
. mental inquiry of limited       duration.    That no uncertainty     might
   exist as to the objects to which, in so novel an undertaking, attention

                                                                               1"
                                       397
 was to be     directed,   the Report of the Committee      of Physics, ap
proved and adopted          by the President    and Council of the Royal
 Society, stated in a very few sentences,        remarkable  alike for their
comprehensiveness         and  conciseness,  the desiderata  of magnetical
science.     It  may be convenient to reproduce these, when desiring to
show the degree in which the Observatories have ful<U+FB01>lled their contem
plated purposes     :—“ The observations will naturally refer themselves
to  two chief branches, into which the science of terrestrial magnetism
in its   present state may be divided.         The <U+FB01>rst comprehends the
actual distribution      of the magnetic in<U+FB02>uence over the globe, at the
present epoch, in its mean or average state, when the effects of tem
porary <U+FB02>uctuations       are either  neglected, or eliminated by extending
the   observations     over a su<U+FB02>icient   time to neutralise  their effects.
The other comprises the history of all that is not permanent in the
phenomena, whether it appear in the form of momentary, daily,
monthly, or annual change and restoration ; or in progressive changes
not compensated by counter-changes,         but going on continually accu
mulating in     one direction,  so as in the course  of many years to alter
the mean amount        of the quantities observed.”-—Report, pp. 1, 2.
   With reference to the <U+FB01>rst of these two branches, viz. the actual
distribution of the magnetic influence over the globe at the present
epoch, the Report goes on to state :—“ The three elements, viz. the
horizontal direction, the dip, and the intensity of the magnetic force,
require to be precisely ascertained, before the magnetic state of any
given station on the globe can be said to be fully determined         .  . . .
and as   all  these  elements are at each point now ascertained to be in
a constant state    of <U+FB02>uctuation, and atfected by transient and irregular
changes, the investigation       of the laws, extent, and mutual relations
of these changes is now become essential to the successful prosecu
tion of magnetic discovery.”
   With reference to the second branch, viz. the secular and periodical
variations, it is observed that—“ The progressive and periodical
being mixed up with the transitory changes, it is impossible to sepa
rate them so as to obtain a correct knowledge and analysis of the
former, without taking express account of and eliminating the latter;”
and with reference to the secular changes in particular,            it is re
marked—“These           cannot   be concluded    from  comparatively    short
series  of observations without giving to those observations extreme
                                                           2 n 2

                                          398
  nicety, so as to determine with perfect precision the mean state           of the
  elements at the two extremes of the period embraced;                  which,    as
  already observed, presupposes a knowledge           of the casual deviations.”
     It is clear from these extracts that in the discussion of the obser
  vations the <U+FB01>rst point, in the order of time, ought necessarily to be
  an investigation into     “ the laws, extent, and mutual relations of the
  transient and,”      (as they    were called at the time the Report was
  written,) “irregular changes,”           as a  preliminary step to the elimi
  nation   of their in<U+FB02>uence on the observations from which a correct
 knowledge and analysis of the progressive and periodical changes were
  to be obtained.        It will  be proper     to show therefore, in the <U+FB01>rst
  place, what the Observatories have accomplished in regard to the so
  called casual or transitory      variations.
      Casual Variations.—All that was known regarding these phe
  nomena at the period when the Report of the Committee of Physics
  was  written,   was,    that there occurred occasionally, and, as it was
  supposed, irregularly, disturbances in the horizontal direction of the
  needle, which were known to prevail, with an accord which it was
 impossible    to ascribe to accident, simultaneously          over considerable
 spaces   of the earth’s     surface, and were believed to be in some un
  known manner       connected, either as cause         or effect, with the ap
 pearances    of the aurora borealis.         The chief feature by which the
 presence of a disturbance of this class could be recognized                at any
 instant of observation,—-or          by which its existence might be sub
  sequently inferred independently          of concert or comparison with other
 Observatories,—appeared          to be,    the de<U+FB02>ection of the needle from
 its usual    or normal     position    to an amount     much    exceeding    what
 might reasonably be attributed to irregularities in the ordinary pe
riodical <U+FB02>uctuations.         The observations which had been made on
the disturbances        anterior   to the institutibn'   of the Colonial Obser
vatories had been chie<U+FB02>y con<U+FB01>ned to the declination.                A  few of the
German Observatories           hadrreceritly-begun     to note the disturbances
of the horizontal        force; but"as yet no conclusions whatsoever had
been obtained       as   to theirlaws‘: in the words of the Committee’s
Report, the disturbances            “apparently     observe no law.”     -‘-By the
instructions    cited above, the <U+FB01>eld         of research   was   enlarged, being    -
made to comprehend            the disturbance-phenomena         of the three    ele
 ments; and the importance             of their examination      was urged, not      ~‘

                                   899
alone   as a means  of eliminating their in<U+FB02>uence on the periodic and
progressive changes, but also on the independent ground, that
                                                                      " the
theory   of the transitory changes might prove itself one of the most
interesting and important points to which the attention of magnetic
inquirers   can be turned, as they are no doubt      intimately  connected
with the general causes of terrestrial     magnetism, and will probably
lead us to a much    more perfect knowledge      of those  causes  than we
now possess."
    The feature which has   been referred to as   furnishing the principal
if not the only certain characteristic of     a disturbance   of this class,
viz. the magnitude    of the departure from the usual or normal state
at the instant   of observation, has, in the discussion of the observa
tions, been made available for the investigation of their laws: it has
afforded the means of recognizing and separating from the entire
mass of hourly observations, taken during several years, a su<U+FB02>icient
body of observations to furnish the necessary data for investigating
at three points of the earth’s surface-one in the temperate zone of
the northern    hemisphere,    a second   in the temperate zone of the
southern hemisphere, and a third in the tropics—the laws or con
ditions regulating or determining the occurrence of the magnetic
 disturbances.    The   method    by which this separation        has  been
effected has been explained on several recent occasions, and will be
found fully described in the Phil. Trans. for 1856, Art.          XV.     By
 processes   of this description, the disturbances of principal mag
 nitude in each of the three elements, the Declination, Inclination
 and Total Force, have been separated from the other observations,
 at the three observatories     of Toronto, Hobarton and St. Helena,
 and submitted to an analysis of which the full particulars will be
 found in the preliminary portions of the volumes which record the
 observations.    By the adoption of a uniform magnitude as constitu
 ting a disturbance   throughout    the whole period comprised       by the
 analysis, the amount   of disturbance in the several years, months, and
 hours is rendered intercomparable.      The result of this investigation
 (which could     not be otherwise    than a   very laborious     operation,
 since the observations at a single one of these stations, Toronto, con
  siderably  exceeded 100,000 in number,       each of which had to he
  passed through several distinct    processes,)   has made known to us
  that the phenomena of this class, which may in future with propriety

                                                400
and advantage receive the appellation of “ occasional,”                             are, in    their
mean or average elfects, subject to periodical laws                      of    a very |system
atic character       ;    placing them, as a <U+FB01>rst step towards                a.n   acquaintance
with their physical causes, in immediate connexion with the sun
as their primary exciting cause. They have—l, a diurnal variation
which follows the order of the solar hours, and manifests therefore
its relation to the sun’s position               as affected by the earth's              rotation
on its axis; 2, an annual variation, connecting itself with the sun's
position   in regard to the ecliptic; and 3, a third variation, which
seems   to refer still more distinctly to the direct action of the sun, since,
both in period and in epochs of maximum and minimum, it coincides
with the remarkable solar period of about ten, or perhaps more nearly
      of our years, the existence of which period has been recently
eleven,
made known to us by the phenomena of the solar spots; but which,
as far as we yet know,               is wholly unconnected with any thermic                      or
physical variation          of any description (except magnetic) at the surface
of the earth, and equally              so    with any other cosmical phenomena with
which we      are acquainted.               The discovery of a connexion of this re
markable description, giving apparently to magnetism a much higher
position     in the       scale   of distinct natural forces than              was previously
assigned to    it,       may justly be claimed on the part of the Colonial Ob
servatories, as the result             of the system of observation enjoined (and
so patiently    and carefully maintained),                   and of the investigation for
which   it   has supplied the data; since              it    was by means of the disturb
ance-variations so determined, that the coincidence between the phe
nomena of the solar spots and the magnitude and frequency                                of mag
netic disturbances             was <U+FB01>rst      perceived and announced                (Phil. Trans.
1852,   Art. VIII.).
  The extent and mutual relation of the disturbance-variations                                of the
three elements, even at            a   single station, supply       a   variety      of points of
approximation            and   of diiference, which are well suited to elucidate
the physical causes            of these remarkable phenomena; but valuable as
such aids may be when obtained                     for   a   single station, their value          is
greatly augmented when we are enabled to compare and combine the
analogous phenomena, as they present themselves at diiferent points
of the‘earth’s surface.            To give but     a     single example :—there are cer
tain variations           produced     by the mean eifects           of the disturbances
which attain their maximum                     at Toronto during the hours                of the

                                          40]
night; the corresponding          variations     attain their maximum, at         Ho
oarton, also during the hours         of the night, but with      a small systematic
difference as to the precise hour, and with this distinguishing pecu
liarity, that the de<U+FB02>ection at Hobarton is of the opposite pole of the
needle (or of the same pole in the opposite direction) to the Toronto
disturbance     ;  whilst at  a third station, St. Helena, which is         a tropical
one, the hours       of principal disturbance        are   those not   of the night,
but   of the day.      A  very super<U+FB01>cial examination is su<U+FB01>icient to show
that for the generalization         of the facts,-a generalization which is
indispensable for their correct apprehension and employment in the
formation     of a theory,—-the      stations at which the phenomena are to
be   known must       be increased.       Those which were chosen for           a <U+FB01>rst
experiment were well selected to prove the importance                  of the inves
tigation, and thus to lead to its extension.             It is only at the Colonial
Observatories that the disturbance-variations             have hitherto been made
out   ; and taking experience as our guide, we have before us the evi
dence    of the   means by   which the inquiry may be further successfully
prosecuted * .
    Periodical Variati0na.—The anticipation expressed in the Report
of the Committee of Physics, that for the purpose of obtaining a cor
   *  The Colonial Observatories under my superintendence were originally four in
number, viz. Toronto, St. Helena, Cape of Good Hope, and llobarton.             In July
1846 the detachment     of the Artillery at the   Cape of Good Hope was withdrawn
by orders from England, and the charge      of the magnetical   and meteorological ob
servations transferred to Mr. Maclear, the Government Astronomer at that station.
The magnetical observations made at the Cape, when the magnetic observatory
was one of those under my superintendence, were published in 1851, with a dis
cussion of certain of their results;    and the disturbance-variation   of the declina
tion at the Cape has since been deduced by my assistant, Captain Younghusband,
Phil. Trans.   1853,  Art. VI.   Since the transfer to Mr. Maclear,         Mr. Pierce
Morton,   a gentleman of considerable mathematical attainments, who has been
added as an assistant    to Mr. Maclear in that branch of the Cape observations,
has applied himself to the investigation of the lunar magnetic in<U+FB02>uence (as derived
from the Cape observations), with a view of presenting the results to the Royal
Society.    For this, and other deductions,—such      as, for example,  the laws of the
disturbances of the inclination and total force,—he will have the entire series of
observations, viz. those  as above-stated   already published, and those which have
 been made since the transfer of the Observatory, up to the present time.

 rect knowledge   of the regular periodical variations, it would    be found
 necessary to eliminate the “casual perturbations,” has been fully
                                              “ casual”
con<U+FB01>rmed.       Had the latter been strictly               (or accidental, in
 a sense contradistinguished     from and opposed to periodical), a su<U+FB02>i
 ciently extended continuance of observation might have occasioned
 their mutual compensation ; but now that we have learned that the
 mean effects which they produce are governed by periodical laws, and
that these laws and those of the regular periodical variations are dis
similar in their epochs, it is manifest that in their joint and undivided
effects we have two variations, due to different causes and having di
 stinct laws, superimposed upon each other; to know the one correctly
 we must necessarily therefore eliminate the other.         A striking illus
 tration of the importance of such elimination is furnished by the solar
diurnal variation of the total force.     It will readily be imagined that
the question must be an important one, whether a variation, which
is supposed to derive its origin from the sun, be a single or a double
progression; whether it have two maxima and two minima in the
twenty-four hours, or but one maximum and one minimum in that
period.    When no separation is made of the disturbances, the pro
gression appears to be a double one, having two minima, one occur
ring in the day and the other in the night. With the removal of
the disturbed observations the night minimum disappears, and we
 learn that the regular solar-diurnal variation of the total force has
but one notable in<U+FB02>ection in the twenty-four hours, viz. that which
takes place during the hours when the sun is above the horizon.
The night minimum        is in fact the mean   e<U+FB02>"ect of the occasional dis
turbances.     It is probable that the nocturnal in<U+FB02>ection      of the solar
diurnal variation    of the Declination may be ascribed to the same
cause, namely to the superposition of two distinct variations.
    A careful analysis of the solar-diurnal variations of the Declination
at the Colonial Observatories       has brought     to light   the existence
at all these stations,  of an annual inequality in the direction of the
needle concurrent      with   changes in the     sun’s declination,   having
its maxima (in opposite directions) when the sun is in or near the
Opposite solstices, and disappearing at or near the epochs of the
equinoxes.     An intercomparison      of the results of the analysis at
 these stations has shown, that this inequality has the remarkable
 characteristics of having notably the same direction and amount in

                                      408
the southern as in the northern hemisphere, and in the tropical as in
the temperate zones.      An ingenious explanation of these phenomena
has been suggested by Dr. Langberg of Christiania (Proceedings of
the Royal Society, vol.        p. 434); but whether this explanation be
or be not the correct one, the theoretical importance of the facts can
not be doubted, inasmuch as they appear to be wholly irreconcileable
with the hypothesis which would attribute the magnetic variations
to thermic causation.      We may ascribe to the general and almost
exclusive prevalence    of the thermic hypothesis, and to its influence
on magnetic     reasonings, that the well-known erroneous opinion was
so con<U+FB01>dently promulgated by a deservedly high magnetic authority*,
that a line must exist surrounding the globe, in which the needle
would be found to have no diurnal variation.             We have now, on the
contrary,   reason to be assured, by the facts      of the annual inequality
thus discovered,    that there is no such line      ;  but that everywhere in
the regions    of its supposed existence       a diurnal    variation subsists,
having opposite characteristics       in opposite parts of the year      as in
<U+FB02>uenced by the sun's position on either side          of the equator, and dis
appearing    only at the epochs when the sun passes              from south to
north or from north to south Declination.
   Lunar Var-iation.—But if thermic relations have failed to supply
a connecting    link between the sun and those magnetic variations
which are, without doubt, referable to the sun as their primary cause,
the failure of that hypothesis is made still more obvious by the ex
istence of variations governed by the moon’; position relatively to the
place  of observation.    We    are   indebted   to   M. Kreil, now holding
the same position     in Austria that     I  have <U+FB01>lled in England, for the
<U+FB01>rst suggestion of the existence of        a lunar-diurnal variation of one
of the elements, viz. of the Declination,        founded on observations at
Milan and Prague; and in the Phil. Trans. for I856, Art. XXIL,
will be found an exposition of the facts of the moon’s diurnal in<U+FB02>u
ence  on each    of the three magnetic elements at Toronto, viz. on
the Declination, Inclination, and Total Force.             In the case of this
investigation,  notwithstanding     the smallness     of the values concerned,
the instrumental     means supplied to the Colonial Observatories         have
been   found   competent to determine, with an approximationi             sul<U+FB01>

cient for present theoretical purposes, the character              and amount    for
each element    of the regular daily effect of the moon on the terrestrial
magnetic phenomena, the existence of which does not appear to have
been even suspected at the time when the Report                 of the Committee
 of Physics  was drawn   up.        The discovery of the moon’s in<U+FB02>uence on
 any of the magnetic elements is due, as already stated, to               M. Kreil   ;
but Toronto is the <U+FB01>rst, and          as yet the    only, station, at which the
numerical values at every lunar hour of the lunar- diurnal variations
 of the three elements have been published.                  Corresponding state
ments to that which has been given for Toronto, will be found for
 St. Helena and Hobarton, in the volumes                  of those observatories,
 which   are now  in preparation.         All  the results at the three stations
 present the same general characters.              The lunar in<U+FB02>uence       does not
 appear to participate    in the decennial inequality which is found in
 all the solar variations (Phil. Trans. 1857, Art. 1.). The lunar
 diurnal variation   of each of the elements is          a double progression      in
 the twenty-four hours,       having epochs of. maximum              and minimum
 symmetrically    disposed.       In    character,    therefore,   it differs from
 what might be expected to take place            if the  moon were possessed       of
 inherent   magnetism,    i.  e.   if  she  were a magnet,        as   it is usually
 termed, per se ; and accords with the phenomena which might be
 expected to follow if she were magnetic only by induction from the
 earth.    On the other hand, it is believed that the amount of the
 variation, as observed at each        of these stations, very far    exceeds   what
 can be imagined      to proceed from the earth’s inductive               action re
<U+FB02>ected from the moon.        In this     theoretical difficulty we are naturally
thrown back to      seek a more extensive knowledge            of the phenomena
than we have yet obtained, and to the generalization which will follow,
when su<U+FB02>icient materials for it have been procured.                 In   subordinate
particulars,  a dilference,   which is apparently systematic, is perceived
to exist in regard to the hours which constitute the epochs of maxima
and minima at the three stations, as well as in regard to the amounts
of the respective variations     ;   these di<U+FB02>'erences    are no doubt    intimately
connected with the causes          of the phenomena, and         are  likely to lead
to their elucidation.      It  is therefore greatly        to be  desired that the
number of stations furnishing complete determinations,                  such as the
Colonial Observatories       only have hitherto supplied,            should be in
 creased.

   The domain of periodical variations has thus been considerably
enlarged since the Report of the Committee of Physics was drawn
up  ; and must henceforth      be understood      to comprise, in addition to
the variations
                 “ whose amount is a function of the hour-angle of the
                             ”
sun, and of his longitude       (or of his declination) (Report, p. l0),—
lst, those variations of the three elements whose amount is a time
tion  of the hour-angle of the moon; 2ndly, those variations which
were classed in the Committee’s
                                                     “ irregular," or “
                                         Report   as                    appa
rently observing no law,” but which are now known to be governed
by laws depending on the sun's declination,            and hour-angle; and
                                     “           ”
3rdly,   those_ variations,  both       regular     and “occasional,” which
have their epochs and amounts            dependent    apparently   on a solar
period   of not yet perfectly ascertained duration, manifesting itself
also by periodical changes in the frequency and amount of the solar
spots.    With the exception of the last-named class, all these varia
tions require, for their generalization,     that the phenomena should     be
investigated   at several points    of the earth’s surface widely distant
from    each other; and we have now the knowledge,               grounded  on
experience, that a very few years are su<U+FB02>icient for the observations
at each station,    with the instrumental       means and methods recom
mended by the Royal Society, and when the investigation             is made a
primary object by those who       engage   in it.
    Absolute Values and Secular Changes.—But interesting and valu
able as is the acquisition of a fuller and more precise knowledge of
the comparatively     small magnetic variations produced at the surface
of the earth by the action or in<U+FB02>uence of external bodies, even
greater importance seems to attach,—when terrestrial magnetism is
in question,—to the purposes        of that distinct branch of the duties of
a magnetic observatory, which consists in the determination of the
absolute values and secular changes of the three magnetic elements.
By the absolute values we seek to acquire a knowledge of the
actual   present   order  and    distribution of the terrestrial     magnetic
in<U+FB02>uence at the surface     of the earth, and to provide the materials by
which the constancy, or otherwise, of the earth's magnetic charge
 may hereafter be examined; and by determinations of the present
 direction and amount of the secular changes, we seek to become
 acquainted with the laws, and ultimately with the causes, of that

“.
                                            406
     most mysterious        change, by which the magnetic condition           of the
     globe at one epoch passes progressively        and systematically     into that
      of another.     It is specially by determinations    of this class, obtained
      with the necessary precision in different parts of the globe, that, in
      the words of the Comn<U+FB01>ttee’s Report,
                                                  “ the patient inductive inquirer
      must seek to ascend to the general laws of the earth’s magnetism."
     At the time when the Report of the Committee of Physics was
      written,   doubts   were reasonably     entertained,   whether    the limited
     time, during which the Colonial Observatories              were likely to be
      maintained    in action, would     be  su<U+FB01>icieut  for the determination      of
      the secular changes     ; and  it was therefore very properly argued, that
      “ these changes cannot be concluded from comparatively short series
      of observations without giving to the observations extreme nicety, so
      as to determine    with perfect precision the mean     state  of the elements
      at the two extremes       of the period embraced.”         It  is with much
      satisfaction, and with a well-deserved recognition       of the pains which
     have been bestowed by the successive Directors of the Toronto Ob
     servatory, and their Assistants,      on this branch   of their duties, that   I
     am able to refer to the determinations           of the absolute values and
     secular changes     of the three elements contained in the third volume
     of the Toronto Observations, in evidence that the instrumental means
     which were devised, and the methods which have            been adopted, have
     proved, under all the disadvantages         of a <U+FB01>rst essay, su<U+FB02>icient to de
     termine these data with a precision         which is greatly in advance of
     preceding     experience, and, as far as may be judged,           equal to the
     present requirements       of theoretical investigation.     This is the more
   i
     deserving    of notice, because Toronto is a station where the casual and
     periodical variations, which it was apprehended would seriously in
     terfere with the determination of absolute values, are unusually large.
     We may derive, therefore, from the results thus obtained, the greatest
     encouragement to persevere in a line of research which is no longer
     one   of doubtful experiment, and to give it that further extension
     which the interests of science require.
         Amongst the results which have recompensed the labours of the
     Colonial Observatories in this branch of their inquiries, perhaps there
     is none   of more importance in respect to the general theory of ter
     restrial magnetism, than the conclusion which has been              established
      by means of the observations of the Declination         at St. Helena, that

                                       4-07
the current     annual amount      of secular change takes place by equal
aliquot porlions in every mon!/I, and even in every fortnight of the
year. The magnitude of the annual change of the Declination at
St. Helena, 8' (or more precisely 7"93 in each of the eight years in
which the observations were maintained), and the comparative tran
quillity of the tropical regions in regard to magnetic disturbances,
were circumstances which rendered St. Helena a particularly eligible
locality for an investigation     of this nature.   The result has  been, to
remove secular change altogether from the category of atmospheric
or thennic relations, with which, in the absence         of a correct know
ledge   of the facts, it has frequently been erroneously associated; and
to  show conclusively that it is a phenomenon of far more systematic
order and regularity     than has been generally apprehended (Proceed
ings   of the Royal Society, vol.         pp. 67-75).
    It has thus been shown, that, in each and all        of the branches of
inquiry for which the institution of the Colonial Observatories was
recommended, they have accomplished the objects which were con
templated, and have in many respects exceeded           the expectations on
which their recommendation           was  founded.    Nor has the  scope  of
their performance been limited to a mere registry of the observa
tions, or to their publication in a crude and undigested form. It was
well remarked by an authority of the greatest weight, when address
ing the British Association       on the occasion of the assembly     of the
Magnetical and Meteorological-Conference            at Cambridge in 1845
(Herschel, Address, p. xxxv), that “A man may as well keep a
register   of his dreams,  as   of the weather or any other set of daily
phenomena, if the spirit of grouping, combining, and eliciting results
be absent.”      To advance by the simple and straightforward path of
inductive inquiry, in a science such as terrestrial magnetism in which
a physical    theory has yet to be sought, the endeavour must be made
“to grapple with the palpable phenomena, seeking means to reduce
their features to measurement;         the measurements to laws; the laws
to higher generalizations     ; and so, step by step, to advance to causes
 and theories.”     The   mere observational part is not, and ought never
 to be, viewed as the    ful<U+FB01>lment of the duties of institutions such     as
 magnetic observatories     ;  those duties ought always to be held to in
 clude (either on the part of the Directors of the Observatories them

                                       408
   selves, or on that of persons who,      as Superintendents    or otherwise,
   have constantly watched the progress of the work)
                                                             “ the systematic
   deduction from the registered observations, of the mean values, and
   of the local coe<U+FB01>icients of diurnal, annual, and secular change; ”
   because “no other class of persons stands in anything like so favour
   able a position   for working out the <U+FB01>rst elementary laws of pheno
   mena, and referring them to their immediate points of dependence,”
   as those who have directed     or superintended the processes by which
   the data required     for the knowledge of the phenomena have been
   obtained.     The introductory discussions pre<U+FB01>xed to the several vo
  lumes which contain the observations at the Colonial Observatories,
   and a succession of papers presented to the Royal Society, and pub
  lished in the Philosophical Transactions,        bear testimony to at least
   unsparing    labour, on the part   of the Superintendent, to give    a com
   pleteness to the experiment     of Colonial Observatories, corresponding
   to its original conception; though no one is more sensible than him
   self that this portion of the duty might well have fallen into abler
  hands.     One great advantage in the task has undoubtedly          been en
  joyed, viz. the union of the detailed knowledge above alluded to,
  with the opportunity of generalization and consequent insight,
   a<U+FB01>"orded by results    admitting of strict comparison and combination,
   obtained   from well-selected stations at such distant points of the
   globe, and by a uniform system of observation.
      It may be useful on the present occasion to recall to more distinct
  recollection the views and opinions entertained by those who were the
  principal instigators of the proceedings by which the Royal Society
  became the responsible advisers,—and Her Majesty’s Government
  the chief supporters,—of measures which have placed this country
  in the very conspicuous position of taking that lead in the advance
  ment of certain branches of science, which other nations were willing
—
  and desirous that she should take.          These views cannot be better
  stated than in the words     of one to whom all will  be willing to concede
  pre-eminence, as well in counselling the recommendation         to Govern
  ment as in conducting the several points connected with it to a suc
  cessful issue (Herschel, in Quart. Review, No.                       “ Great
                                                        CXXXI.).
  physical theories, with their trains    of practical consequences,  are pre
  eminently national objects, whether for glory or utility.          In  effect,
  such they ought to be considered by every nation calling         itself civi

                                            409
lized; and       if we look to consequences, we have only             to point to the
history of     science    in all its branches      to show,    that every great ac
cession to theoretical          knowledge has uniformly been followed              by a
new practice,        and by the abandonment           of ancient methods      as com
paratively      ine<U+FB01>icient and unecononical.             This consideration alone
we think su<U+FB01>icient to justify, even on utilitarian grounds, a large and
liberal devotion        of the public means to setting on foot undertakings
and maintaining establishments, in which the investigation of physical
laws, and the determination            of exact data, should     be the avowed and
primary object, and practical             application   the secondary,     incidental,
and collateral         one.    That the time is now fully arrived when other
great branches         of physical knowledge must         be considered as entitled
to share in that public support and encouragement which has hitherto
fallen to the lot of astronomy alone, will, we think, be granted with
out hesitation        by all who duly consider        the present state and pro
spects    of science.        The great problems which           o<U+FB02>'er  themselves on
all hands for solution—problems which the wants of the                      age force
upon us as practically          interesting, and with which its intellect          feels
itself competent to deal—are             far more complex in their conditions,
and depend on data which, to be              of use, must    be accumulated      in far
greater masses,         collected over an in<U+FB01>nitely wider <U+FB01>eld, and worked
upon with a greater and more systematized power, than has su<U+FB01>iced
for the     necessities      of astronomy.       The collecting,      arranging,    and
duly combining          these    data are operations, which, to be carried out
to the extent       of the requirements of modern science, lie utterly be
yond the reach of all private industry, means or enterprize.                        Our
demands are not merely for a slight and casual sprinkling to refresh
 and invigorate anornamental            or luxurious product, but for a copious,
 steady,    and well-directed stream, to call forth           from a coil ready to
yield it, an ample, healthful, and remunerating harvest.                    There are
 secrets of nature we would fain see revealed,—resources hidden in her
 fertile bosom for the well-being            of man upon earth,        we would     fain
 see opened up        for the use of the generation to which we belong. But
 if we would be enlightened by the one, or bene<U+FB01>ted by the other,
 we must     lay on power, both moral and physical,               without grudging
 and without stint.”
    If at  the period when it was still doubtful what the Colonial Oh
 servatories then just established might be able to accomplish,--and

  the anticipations       of what     a voyage    of discovery upon an unknown
  ocean might produce,—-the propriety               of embarking upon such inves
  tigations was thus unhesitatingly          a<U+FB02>irmed, how much more con<U+FB01>dently
  may the duty        of perseverance be insisted upon, when the‘ results of
  the <U+FB01>rst experiment have already more than realized the hopes which
  caused it to be undertaken.             They have indeed con<U+FB01>rmed the belief
                                                                      ” is of a nature
  that “the gigantic problem proposed                to be resolved
  to yield in its full extent only to “continued and persevering inquiry;”
  but at the same time they may be said, in a certain sense, to have
  narrowed the <U+FB01>eld of inquiry, by showing more distinctly than was
  previously     apprehended, both what is desired to be known, and how
  and where      it is to be sought.        If the history     of magnetical science
  is to be something more than a fragment, the research must be per
  severed    in.
     In  considering the means by which the researches thus opened out
  may be most advantageously prosecuted,                it is natural that  we should
 look, in the <U+FB01>rst instance, to the adoption, at other selected stations,
 of arrangements similar to those which were instituted at the stations
 which were chosen for           a  <U+FB01>rst, and  as  it has proved, successful expe
 riment   ;   and with this view        I  may be permitted       to restate the opi
 nions which       I  submitted to the Magnetical and Meteorological             Con
 ference at Cambridge in 1845, as all that has since taken place has
 served   to con<U+FB01>rm them.
     “ Before I      close  this communication,         I  wish to advert to the   ex
 pediency     of extending the system of observation now in operation at
 Toronto, St. Helena, and the Cape of Good Hope, to other of the
 British Colonies, where the           same objects can be accomplished         in an
 equally effective and economical manner.
     “ In   cases    where     the   institution    of similar     establishments    is
 strongly urged by the Governor of a C0lony,—where competent per
 sons are present and disposed to superintend                  the observations, and
 where soldiers of the Artillery are stationed whose services may be
 available, and whose employment has been shown to be economical
 and effective in a high degree              in the execution of     a laborious and
 exact routine       of observation,—there        is wanting only a supply      of in
 strnments,-—the        temporary allotment of a building to contain them,

                                         4-ll
 receive,—a.nd      an authorized      connexion     with   a head-quarter     esta
 blishment whence they may derive instruction and guidance.
     “ The cost of     one   of the Ordnance Observatories (including £100
 a year   for incidentals of all kinds) is £392        a year, exclusive   of pub
 lication.    It may be assumed that <U+FB01>ve years of hourly observation
 is a su<U+FB01>icient     time    of continuance for obtaining in any particular
 colony    the mean values of the magnetical             and meteorological     ele
 ments, and their diurnal, annual, and secular variations, as well as
 the peculiarities     of climate bearing on the health and industrial oc
 cupations of man.           If the observations were printed in full detail
 for the five years, they would occupy two quarto volumes; but if it
 were   thought su<U+FB01>icient hereafter that duplicate or triplicate manu
 script copies should         be deposited   in different    public libraries, and
 that publication should be con<U+FB01>ned to abstracts and an analysis, the
cost   of the publication would form but          a small addition.
    “The     colonies of Ceylon, New Brunswick, Bermuda,                and New
 foundland    are in the described case       ; their respective Governors       are
 recommending        the establishment     of .\lagnetical and Meteorological
Observatories      in them; competent directors           are  on the spot [this
was    written in 1845] ;      and they are all Artillery stations.”
    To the four stations thus named may            be now added    Mauritius and
 Dernerara, as from both those Colonies, strong and repeated applica
tions to the same effect have been sent through their respective Go
vernors to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.             Both these Colo
nies have offered to bear a portion       of the expense of the proposed      esta
blishments; and have earnestly solicited to be placed in connexion
with a head-quarter establishment, from which they might receive
properly constructed instruments, with instructions and guidance in
their use.      Can it be said that we perform our duty as a mother
country when we put such applications on the shelf '!—whilst, in the
interests of science,      it would   be  dit<U+FB01>cult to estimate too highly the
value    of such institutions,—in forming good observers, who might
subsequently extend their activity          over a wider range,—in affording
to travelling observers the opportunity          of testing and correcting their
instruments,     as well    as keeping   up and perfecting      their skill in oh
servation,-—and       in contributing to arouse, to nourish, and to extend
to other parts of natural knowledge, that desire for the greatest pos

         in geodesical operations of the highest class.
             When it was <U+FB01>rst suggested that the officers and soldiers of the
         scienti<U+FB01>c corps of the army (Artillery or Engineers)           stationed in the
          Colonies    might, both bene<U+FB01>cially to themselves and advantageously
         to the public interests, be made available          for the performance of
         such temporary       services, the suggestion,    from    its novelty,     might
         have been open to many objections.           None    were,   indeed, made by
         the military authorities      of the time, who on the contrary approved
         and encouraged the proposition.          There may have been doubts en
          tertained in other quarters whether persons, whose ordinary occu
          pations were so dissimilar, would be found to possess the necessary
          quali<U+FB01>cations   for carrying out   a scheme   of exact and varied observa
          tion, in which there was then no precedent to guide, and of which
          the performance would be sure to be extensively and closely scruti
          nized: but such doubts,       if they existed, have probably          long since
          subsided,    as the successive volumes      of the Colonial Observatories
          have appeared.
             One great and unquestionable advantage which future institutions
          of this nature will have over those whose duties           are accomplished,
          will  be  found in the assistance they will derive from the Physical
          Observatory of the British Association at Kew, as a head-quarter
          Observatory, in which their instruments can be prepared and ve
          ri<U+FB01>ed,   the constants, &c. carefully    determined,    new instruments        be
          devised as occasion may require,        and tested by experiment before
          they are sent out for use, and to which practical            difficulties  of all
          kinds, which may present themselves to the directors, may be re
          ferred.
             The omission of     a provision  of this kind when the Observatories
          were <U+FB01>rst formed, was undoubtedly          a great  fault, which has        been,
          and could only be, very imperfectly       remedied by the Woolwich esta
          blishment,    designed for a very     different  purpose,      and insufficient
          even   for the duties for which it was designed.
             There is another advantage (if it be one) which might attend the
           early prosecution, viz. the opportunity of consulting               (if it were
           desired to consult) the experience of the person who has conducted,
           -—and, as he believes, successfully conducted,—the <U+FB01>rst experiment,

 from its commencement         now almost to its close; but this, in the
 course   of nature, can only   be available for a few years to come.
    The Colonial establishments were instituted at the instance of the
 Royal Society and British Association,        with  a more general concur
rence and approval on the part        of the cultivators    of science in all
parts   of the globe than, it is believed,    were ever before manifested in
regard to any purely scienti<U+FB01>c undertaking; and with such a cordial
and effective cooperation     of the public authorities   as is well deserving
of being held in remembrance.          It is  for those two great scienti<U+FB01>c
bodies to consider whether any, and what, steps should now be taken
to procure the continuance       of the researches.

        the Healthy State.”        By W. Mancar, M.D., F.C.S., As
        sistant Physician     to the Westminster       Hospital.     Commu

                                  (Abstract .)
    In   a previous paper   I  had the honour of communicating          to the
Royal Society the results of a <U+FB01>rst         series of investigations on the
immediate principles of the faces of man and animals; since then I
have continued      my researches on human         excrcments,    being most
ably seconded by my assistant,       Mr. Frederick Dupré, Ph.D.
    The new results obtained were the following :-—
    l. Maayarate of     lime, phosphate    of lime,  and margarate    of mag
nesia were discovered to be immediate principles          of human evacua
tions.
    2.  I found a new method for obtaining excretine, and its chemical
formula has been established.

      3. The fact that vegetable food induces the presence of margaric
  acid in excrements has been con<U+FB01>rmed.
      4. The existence of a comparatively       large quantity of cholesterine
  in the spleen, which    I  had mentioned before as probable, has been
  con<U+FB01>rmed.
      When human     faeces are exhausted      with boiling alcohol, the <U+FB02>uid
  being rapidly strained through a cloth,          a clear extract is obtained,
  which, on cooling, yields a deposit; this substance, being collected
  on a <U+FB01>lter, is partly soluble in boiling alcohol, and there remains un
  dissolved a residue insoluble in ether and alcohol.             The residue in
  question being boiled with a solution           of potash, dissolves almost
  entirely, and the addition of hydrochloric acid induces the formation
  of  a precipitate  in the solution.      On examining this precipitate, it
  was found to consist of a    crystallizable substance fusing at 60° Cent.;
  its structure   and other properties were precisely those of margaric
  acid.
      The acid <U+FB01>ltrate contained        phosphoric     acid and lime.      From
  several quantitative   analyses,   I  concluded that there was more lime
  than is required to combine with the phosphoric acid in the form of
  the neutral phosphate,      the excess of lime being exactly that which
  was necessary to convert the margaric         acid into a neutral margarate
  of lime, CQH33 O3+CaO.            Consequently it followed that the three
  substances existed in the form of margarate of lime and phosphate
  of lime   as immediate principles     of human    faeces.
      The alcoholic <U+FB01>ltrate from the deposit being allowed to stand for
   twenty-four hours, deposited another substance, of a nearly white
   appearance, and which proved to be margarate             of magnesia.
      The peculiar action of a vegetable diet on human feeces was inves
  tigated by means of experiments undertaken upon myself, when I
   observed that an entirely vegetable diet was attended with the form
   ation of a large quantity of margaric acid in the excrements,—most
   probably not in the form of a margarate, but in the free state, inas
   much as it was obtained from the decomposition, with hydrochloric
   acid, of the precipitate    induced by adding milk of lime to the cold
   and clear alcoholic extract of faeces, after the separation of the above
   described deposits.
       In the month of December 1855,        I had an opportunity of noticing
    that during   a cold    night, when the temperature          falls below the

                                              4-15
freezing-point,        ezcretine    crystallizes      readily and in large quantity in
the clear alcoholic           extract    of fwces;         this method           I    employed    as
often as possible, to prepare enough excretine for its chemical ana
lysis but the cold weather not lasting long enough, and this season
        ;
having been remarkably mild, I was compelled to adopt a modi<U+FB01>ca
tion    of the process by milk of lime, described in my former commu
nication.
   Having prepared                      of excretine, partly by the
                              a su<U+FB01>icient     quantity
action of cold, and partly by means of milk of lime, the chemical
composition of this substance was now detennined.     A qualitative
analysis showed it to consist of carbon, hydrogen, sulphur and
oxygen*; there was no water of crystallization present. Oxide of
copper       was     employed      at <U+FB01>rst for the combustions,                      but they were
subsequently         undertaken with chromate                  of lead, on account of the
large proportion of carbon that cxcretine contains; no substance
having been found to combine with                       it,    its atomic composition was
calculated from the assumption                  that one equivalent contained one
equivalent of sulphur; and the following formula was obtained :—

the plate which accompanies the paper illustrates the shape and
arrangement          of its crystals.
   In   my former communication             I    had stated that when the tissue   of
the spleen      is   submitted to    a   process of analysis similar to that adopted
for the extraction of excretine,            a   substance closely allied to choleste
rine    is         This subject being one of great importance in
             obtained.                                                                            a
physiological point of view,   have resumed the investigation, and
                                        I
placed beyond doubt that this substance                        is     really cholesterine.       Its
  * In my former communication        had erroneously stated that excretine con
                                          I
tained nitrogen, which resulted from my not having been able to prepare    sul<U+FB01>              a
ciently large quantity of the substance; and, moreover,     might not have been
                                                                           it

presence in the spleen is evidently independent of that which might
exist in the blood retained by this organ after death.         Is it that the
spleen secretes cholesterine?      This can only be determined by actual
experiment;     but it is very remarkable       that a part   of the blood
which is supplied to the liver should come directly from an organ
containing large quantities of a substance known to enter into the
composition    of the bile.

 IV. “ Anatomical Description of             a Species     of Asteroid Polypcs,
       probably forming the type of a new genus of Alcyonidæ.”
        By JOHN DENIS MAcnoNALn, Assist. Surg. R.N. Com
        municated by Capt. DENIIAM,               F.R.S.       Received January
        13, 1857.
    On leaving the Conway Reef (lat. 2l° 44' 48" S., long.                174° 37'
45"   E.), July    4, 1855, a very beautiful       branched asteroid Zoophyte,
belonging to the Alcyonidae, was brought up from a depth of between
 30 and 40 fathoms, on the buoy-rope            of the anchor.
    The polypidom,      from a trunk of about one inch and a half in
diameter, branched        o<U+FB02>‘,   with much irregularity, but generally in          a
dichotomous      manner, into very minute subdivisions.
    The investing membrane was strengthened by the                close deposition
 of elongated, fusiform,       and minutely tubereulated spicula of a deep
 crimson-lake    tint, which impart their colour to the whole mass.
    The internal substance was chie<U+FB02>y composed of longitudinal mus
 cular septa, radiating        from   the central axis (which contained no
 denser material), frequently communicating with one another late
 rally, and being <U+FB01>xed into the internal surface of the integument in
 vertical lines. These muscular septa were invested on each side with
 a  layer  of <U+FB01>nely reticulated vessels; both          sets   being connected by

                                      418
numerous transverse trunks passing through the intervening muscular
tissue, and' the spaces between the septa were <U+FB01>lled with a transparent
glairy <U+FB02>uid.
    The polyp-cells were exposed and solitary,       resting on the internal
surface  of short branchlets strengthened by large dorsal spicula, one
of which, much larger than the rest, extended considerably beyond
the polyp-cells,    tapering gently to a needle-like point.       These latter
spicula are covered with tubercles,      and in every respect, but in size,
similar to those of the general integument.
    The small spicula on the internal or ventral surface of the branch
lets diverge from one another in the peripheral direction, while those
on the dorsal border are disposed longitudinally.
    The mouth of each cup-like polyp-cell       was surrounded      with about
eight   projecting    spicula, whose <U+FB01>xed extremities       were curved up
wards   and inwards,      festoon-fashion,  while numerous smaller          ones
were so disposed as to      <U+FB01>ll up the open   spaces   posteriorly,   and thus
strengthen the body      of the cell.
   Although    I  have not been able to count the number            of the oral
tentacula   satisfactorily,  from their proportional     size   I  can readily
believe that there were about eight in this species,        as in most   if  not
all other asteroid polypes.       They were broad and <U+FB02>at, tapering to         a
blunt point, like those of Sarcodyction (Forbes), to which genus I
have no doubt this Zoophyte is nearly allied, though the habit of the
polypidom is     so very di<U+FB01>"erent.

I. “A    ‘System of Train-Signalling,          by    which     also   disabled
      Trains may telegraph for assistance             without     the aid of
      portable     apparatus.”      By CHARLES        V. WALKER,         Esq.,
      F.R.S.      Received March 9, 1857'.
                                  (Abstract.)
   When, in the early days of telegraphy,         messages     were sent and

                                         4-19
 trains were signalled        on the same wires,        no facilities      existed for
 reducing the apparatus employed for the latter purpose, to a simple
 form.       The case is now becoming different, special wires being
 largely devoted to train signals; hence the present system.
    The instrument employed is a large electro-magnet, with                   a move
 able armature, carrying a stem and a hammer, which                     latter strikes
 on a hell by the direct force of magnetism.               It is provided with a
 contact-maker, a spring, the depression of which causes a current to
 circulate.     The bobbins       are 4 in.  X  3   in.; and   are    <U+FB01>lled with    ten
 pounds of covered copper wire, No. 16 or No. 18. The core is of
<U+FB01>ve-eight inch iron. The armature and appendages weigh 2* oz.
 Bells of this kind have      been in action    for <U+FB01>ve years without cleaning
or repairing.       The battery is zinc-graphite, and a solution of l sulph.
ac. -|- 8 or 10     water.   The plates, 7} in. X 3 in., are placed in stone
pots that contain about          a quart, the zinc standing      in   a gutta-percha
slipper, containing mercury.            Batteries of this lcind will do their
work untended for half a year and longer.
    The language consists of blows on the bell; the number of blows
varies according      to the train-signal      to be given.       The distinctions
required for ordinary purposes being few, the bell-language                    is very
appropriate, from its addressing the          ear, from its  simplicity and from
the facility with which the signals are given and taken.                     One blow
is for the starting of an ordinary train ; two, for an express; three,
for the arrival of    a train  ; <U+FB01>ve, for stopping all trains     ; six, for testing.
This is a general code; other forms of            code   are used for protecting
level crossings and junctions;          but the fundamental           signals  of the
general code are       of universal application.        This system        was   intro
duced <U+FB01>ve years ago on the South Eastern                   Railway;       and   at the
present     time consists   of about     100   bells, to which additions        are  in
progress.
    The bells    are connected in pairs, both bells being          in  a  circuit that
terminates     in the earth in the usual way, at each station.                     The
signal is made by depressing the spring from its earth-contact, upon
the zinc end of the battery, the graphite end being in permanent
connexion with the earth.          The battery being thus introduced between
the bell    and the earth, a current       circulates along the wire and pro
duces one blow upon the bell.            The home bell may           be excluded or
not from the circuit, when a signal is sent.

                                      420
   By the above arrangement signals        are sent from station to station.
But the extreme simplicity of the battery, the bell, and the language
allows the arrangements to be so modi<U+FB01>ed that signals may be made
on a pair of bells'fr0m any joint, intermediate           between two bell
stations, without    the necessity    of providing the signaller with any
telegraph or battery, or any electrical apparatus whatever.           The ad
dition   of this property to the bells      does   not in any way interfere
with their being in perfect action and constant         use for the ordinary
work   of train-signalling, and therefore if the guards of trains and
the plate-layers of the permanent way are provided with a signal for
expressing their wants, a great advance is made in telegraphy, and
a large element    of safety is gained for the travelling public.
    It is well known      to electricians  that,  if two equal and opposed
currents are presented to the respective ends of a wire, no evidence is
manifested of the circulation      of electric force; the wire is in    a  null
state, as much so as     if no current was presented to it.        Taking ad
vantage   of this law, in connexion with the simple bell-system above
described, the circuit is made to contain the two batteries, one at
each station, as well as the    pair of bells; the   same pole, the graphite,
for instance, of each battery being connected with the earth.
    When the home-station        signaller   desires to make     a signal,  he
depresses   the spring     as before;   but the connexions     are such, that
by this act he excludes his own battery from the circuit.          The circuit
then contains but one battery,—namely           that at the pass  station; the
current   of which is now able to circulate from end to         end, being no
longer counterbalanced       by an equal and opposite current; and con
sequently the bells are     sounded.     This, then, is the process for ordi
nary train-signalling,    under this arrangement.
    By altering the contact-maker so that it inverts the battery in the
circuit, instead of putting it out of circuit, both batteries are made
available for each signal ; and consequently the power and with it the
cost of each may be reduced.
    But the null state of the wire is equally well and very readily
destroyed, by connecting it with the earth at any point intermediate
between the two stations; for by this process a complete circuit is
made or channel opened for the discharge              of both ends of both
 batteries, each independently      of the other, except that the attached
wire between the earth and the telegraph wire is common to both

                                     42 1
circuits, and thus the bells at the respective stations are actuated by
                                                                                '
the batteries of the respective stations.      If ten blows with a pause     of
a minute, and then ten more, is the signal that the engine is disabled;
ten blows, and a minute of contact, that an accident has happened          ;  a
ringing continued beyond ten, that the permanent way is obstructed,
the stations at either   side are   advised and can take the measures
necessary to meet the case.
    These contacts may   be made by    hooking   a wire or rod on to the line
wire and making the necessary contacts with the           rail; or, which is
better, by establishing    contact-makers,   properly secured at frequent
intervals on the telegraph posts.
    This system gives to those in charge of disabled trains a certain
means of asking for assistance from any point of the open railway,
without any training beyond that of counting ten slowly and cor
 rectly. In practice, as between Red-Hill and Reigate, no inconveni
ence or loss of electricity has been suffered from counterbalancing the
 two currents.
     The author   states that   there   are  other   properties  of opposed
 currents to be communicated on another occasion.

                                        Vapour in disturbing the Atmo
         sphere.” By Tuouss Hornms, Esq.                 Communicated by
         W. FAIRBAIRN, Esq., F.R.S. Received January 2, 1857.
                                 (Abstract.)
      In this paper it was   maintained    that the great disturber of the
  equilibrium of atmospheric pressure is the aqueous vapour which is
  diffused through the gases.     These gases, when ascending, cool (say
  5°) through expansion by diminution of incumbent pressure, whilst
  the vapour that is within them cools only 1°; and a consequence is,
  that when    a mixed  mass   ascends,   the vapour is condensed by the
  cold of the gases.    It  is well known     that condensation of vapour
  gives out much heat, and this heat warms and expands the gases
  when they are forced to ascend, taking vapour with them          ; and the
  process being repeated and continued,        an ascending current is pro
  duced in the atmosphere,     cloud is formed, the barometer sinks, rain
  falls, and winds blow towards the part.
      This was shown to take place in all latitudes, producing disturb

                                     422      \
ances great   in proportion to the amount of vapour condensed.              In
tropical regions, where the aqueous material is abundant, the dis
turbances are great, but take place principally in the higher regions
of the air.     The diminution of atmospheric pressure within the tro
pics at the surface of the earth,        as measured     by the barometer,
extends over a large surface, but is not great in any one place.           In
cooler latitudes condensation takes place nearer to the surface        of the
globe, and then reduction      of pressure is con<U+FB01>ned to     a smaller  area;
but in parts on the surface within that       area  the reduction   is great,
because   the lower and therefore heavier gases have been warmed and
 expanded; hence the falls of the barometer in certain cool localities
 are the greatest.    In  very cold and dry regions, as a consequence        of
 there being but little vapour in the air to be condensed, the barometer
 sinks only a little, and that sinking is generally con<U+FB01>ned to a small
 area.   In  accordance with this view,     it was shown that, in certain
places, where much       continuous   rain falls, the barometer has     a low
average;    and towards these areas winds blow from distant parts, as
in the great trade- and other winds.       Sea-breezes were also shown to
be consequences     of the condensation of vapour, which had been pro
 duced by the morning sun ascending to sufficient elevations         ; whilst
 the land-winds    at night are attributable    to the cooling of those ele
 vated parts by evaporation during the absence        of the sun.
    Various objections that had been made to this theory of atmo
 spheric disturbances were noticed by the author of the paper, which,
 though admitted to     be plausible, were stated to be invalid,   whilst the
 most important meteorological       phenomena      were asserted to be in
 accordance with it.

IV. “ On    the Serpentines      of Canada and their associated Rocks."
      By T. Srsaav         llusr,   Esq.,   of the Geological        Survey of
      Canada.      Communicated by THOMAS GRAHAM, Esq.,                  F.R.S.,
      Master of the       slim.     Received    February 26,1857.
   The origin and fonnation of serpentine is still regarded                as  an
unsettled   problem     by chemical      geologists,   and Sir William Logan
having shown from structural         evidence the undoubted strati<U+FB01>ed cha
racter and sedimentary origin        of the serpentine of the Green Moun
tains in Canada,    I  have been induced to make a chemical and mine
ralogical investigation     of these   serpentines    and the rocks associated
with them.      In the present note       I propose to indicate brie<U+FB02>y some
of the results obtained, reserving for another occasion the details of
my examination.
   The serpentines of the Green Mountains, which have                been traced
for 150 miles in Canada, have         been found by      Sir William to belong
to the upper portion of the Lower Silurian system, whose disturbance
and metamorphism         have given rise to the great Apallachian chain,
of which the Green Mountains            are the north-eastern      prolongation.
These mountains       are composed     of gneissoid, micaceous, argillaceous,
talcose, and chloritic schists, with quartzite, limestone, dolomite,
serpentine, pyroxenite,      and the other rocks about to be mentioned.
   The serpentines, which form immense beds, and often cover large
areas, are sometimes homogeneous,           and at other times conglomerate
in their character, the cement being        a ferruginous    dolomite,   or more
rarely   a carbonate     of magnesia, exempt from lime but containing
carbonate of iron.       In  some cases the serpentine is intimately       mixed
with   a large amount      of carbonate of lime.        Chromic and magnetic
iron, ilmenite, diallage, with the ordinary lamellar and <U+FB01>brous varie
ties, picrolite and chrysotile, are common in these serpentine rocks.
The results of    a great number      of analyses show    a uniformity of com
position   in all the serpentines of this formation, and also show a
curious fact hitherto overlooked;-that of the constant presence of a
small portion    of nickel, never exceeding       a few thousandths.      I  have
never failed to detect it in any variety of serpentine from this forma
tion, not only in Canada, but in the States          of Vermont, Connecticut,
and New Jersey.         Its presence    seems  still more widely spread, for     I
have also found nickel in serpentines from California, the Vosges in

                                      4241
 France,   and in a verd antique       marble from a Roman          ruin.   The
association of nickel with the chromic iron and serpentines of Penn
 sylvania has been long known, and        I have found the chromic iron of
 Canada to contain small portions both       of nickel and cobalt, although
the latter metal can rarely be detected in the nickeliferous            serpen
 tines.
    The results of  a number     of analyses show that it is constantly pre
sent in the talcose slates and steatites of this region, and the same is
to be observed of the magnesites and dolomites of the series ; indeed
the distribution of nickel would seem to be co-extensive with that of
the magnesia in this formation,       and the same thing may be said          of
 chrome.     I  have not, however, met with any traces           of chrome or
 nickel in the serpentines and talcose rocks of the Laurentian system,
 which underlies the Silurian and the still older copper-bearing rocks
 of Lake Huron, and probably corresponds to the oldest gneiss of
 Scandinavia.     Both chrome and nickel,         however, characterize the
serpentines    of the Vosges and of California.         I have not yet been
able to examine specimens from other foreign localities.               The pre
sence   of traces of nickel in certain talcs was long since noticed by
Stromeyer.       Much of the so-called talcose slate of the Green Moun
tains is not magnesian, but consists of a hydrous aluminous silicate
allied to pyrophyllite or pholerite, which are alumina-talcs.
    The euphotides, which      are associated  with many of the European
serpentines,   are  not wanting in the Green Mountains, although less
distinctly marked to the       eye than the foreign varieties.        A  tough,
greenish or greyish-white       rock, with a waxy lustre, forms in many
places great strati<U+FB01>ed masses, which are associated with the serpen
tine, and is found      on analysis to consist of a soda-felspar (albite)
with a silicate  of  lime, magnesia, and protoxide of iron, having the
composition    of amphib0le,—thus constituting        a veritable euphotide.
The two minerals      are clearly distinguishable   after calcination, which
blanches    the felspar,   and reddens the ferruginous       silicate.    These
rocks   are by this means distinguished       from others similar in their
appearance and mode       of occurrence, but consisting of petrosilex or
compact siliceous felspar, and equally members of the sedimentary
series. The speci<U+FB01>c gravity of these euphotides shows that the
saussurite or felspar which forms their base has a density not greater
than that of ordinary soda-felspar.

                                     4-25
    Immediately    connected   with the serpentines,    there   sometimes
occurs a white compact rock,       remarkable by its great hardness, and
a density  of 3'3 to 3'5.    Analysis shows this rock to   be a pure lime
alumina    garnet, in some cases, however, mingled with another sili
cate   which appears to belong to the amphiboles.          This garnet is
sometimes blended with serpentine, and at others forms distinct
beds.    In its general aspect it resembles closely the saussurite of the
associated euphotides, and has probably often been confounded with
that mineral by previous observers.       Hence the densities   of 3'2 and
3'3 assigned by different mineralogists to the saussurites of the Alps,
while Delesse has shown that the true saussurite of the euphotide of
Mount Genevre, like that of the Vosges, is a felspar.
    The magnesites of this region form great beds; they are crystal
line, and consist of carbonate of magnesia with some carbonate of
iron, and contain as imbedded minerals in some cases grains of quartz,
in others felspar and talc, and at other times serpentine, but always
holding chrome and nickel, the latter as a greenish carbonate, in the
joints of the rock, or in the form of nickeliferous pyrites.
     These magnesian rocks are not con<U+FB01>ned to the altered portions of
this formation; beds of siliceous dolomite holding protocarbonate of
 iron are found, interstrati<U+FB01>ed with pure fossiliferous limestones, near
 Quebec.      The reaction between silica and the carbonates of lime,
 magnesia, and iron, which      takes place at no very elevated tempera
 ture, in the presence   of water, producing silicates of these  bases with
 evolution    of carbonic  acid, enables us to understand      the process
 which has given rise to the pyroxenes, serpentines, and tales of this
  formation, while the argillaceous limestones, which are not wanting,
  contain all the elements of the garnet-rock.
     The general conclusion deduced from these inquiries, and sustained
  by a great number of analyses, which I hope soon to submit to the
  Society,  is, that  the metamorphism      of these Silurian strata has
  resulted from the chemical reaction, in the presence    of water, of the
  elements existing in the original sedimentary deposits.

     1.   This paper aimed at recommending the introduction into ele
 mentary treatises of the doctrine of Determinants; which, following
 Professor      Boole,  it called Eliminants.            It exempli<U+FB01>ed      the great aid
 to the memory which            the notation affords.          It   undertook    to show,
 that    if  only so much      of new notation         be used, as is needed        in ele
 mentary applications,         the subject becomes full as easy as the second
 part of algebra.         The method of proceeding recommended may                       be
understood by the following concise statement.

simple considerations then show, that m and a will be integer                        func

    In  adapting the theory to the proof            of elementary propositions,        as,
in forming the Product             of two Eliminants, the paper urged the uti
lity of the principle, that every Eliminant is a linear <U+FB01>mclion of any
one of its columns, and also, of any one qf its rows;-which prin
ciple may often be so applied as to show by inspection,                  :2 priuri, that
certain constituents          are excluded     from this and that function, and
thus enable us to obtain its value by assuming arbitrary values for
such constituents.           It   deprecated (at least for elementary uses) the
notations used by        Mr.      Spottiswoode* and others, not only as invol
ving needless novelty to learners, but because no page can be broad
enough to a<U+FB01>'ord to write
  (1, 2)(l, l)'+(2, 2)(l,          2)’-1-(3,  2)(l,  3)’ instead of  BX+bY+/iZ,
and because accents,           so related, are    hard to see in a full page, and
the general aspect       of every element is        so like that of every other       ele
ment, that the fatigue of reading soon becomes                    confusing     and in
tolerable.
    2. But the main topic of the paper was to advocate the use of
Eliminants in Geometry               of three dimensions,        especially    in every
systematic treatise on Surfaces of the Second Degree.                    Various illus
trations and results were given, which the writer believed to be new                      ;
on which account, some of them may be brie<U+FB02>y noticed here.

by Eliminants, as follows.                    Let us inquire after that diameter,               com

Eliminate       m, n, and       you <U+FB01>nd that             p   is to be determined by the very
same       eq. as   in the preceding; and since its                      eq. is   of the third   de
gree,      it has always one real value.
     Next, let the second surface                   be a sphere, and you          <U+FB01>nd at least one
diameter of the <U+FB01>rst surface perpendicular to its conjugate plane.
Make this diameter the axis of                         ac,   and take for the axes of       y and z
the two principal              diameters            of the section in the conjugate plane.
Then D=0,           E=0, F=O              ;    so     that the general       eq.    is reduced to
A.z"+By’+Cz’+ G=0.                       Moreover,            the system    of    axes is now rect
angular: hence the axis of                    3/,   and that     of z, equally with that of 2,
are each perpendicular             to its conjugate plane, and the eq. for                  p   must
have three real roots, corresponding                         to these three axes.
  We might similarly investigate “the conditions of contact for two
concentric surfaces ;” which, when one of them is a sphere, gives the
cubic whose roots are a’,               6*,    c’,   principal    axes   of an Ellipsoid.

 I. “On    an Element of Strength       in Beams subjected     to Trans
       verse Strain,   named    by the author ‘The Resistance          of
       Flexure.”’ (Second Communication.)         By WILLIAM HENRY
       BARLQW, Esq.,    F.R.S.      Received March 12, 1857.
                                (Abstract)
    In his former paper on this subject the author pointed out the
 existence of an element of strength in beams when subjected to trans
verse  strain,-the resistance of <U+FB02>exure—which had       been omitted  in
 the generally received theory   ; and the object of the present experi
mental inquiry is to elucidate more clearly the general bearing        of
the subject, and determine more precisely the laws which          govern
this resistance.
    The forms    of beam employed in the experiments formerly de
scribed were only of two kinds--solid rectangular bars and open
girders; in the present experiments other forms have          been used,
namely,     quare bars broken on their sides,    square bars broken on
their angles, round bars, beams      of the  I section broken with the
<U+FB02>anges horizontal,   and similar beams    broken  with the <U+FB02>anges ver
tical H.
   The results of these experiments are exhibited in Tables, together
with those of the former series; and the author employs them, in
the <U+FB01>rst place, to test the accuracy of the existing theory, by com
paring the resistance of the outer <U+FB01>bres or particles of each of the
forms of beam, calculated on that theory, with the actual tensile
strength of the metal as obtained by direct experiment.       From this
comparison applied to the different    forms of beam, it would follow
that the resistance at the outer <U+FB01>bre varies from        25,271 lbs. to
53,966 lbs., while the tensile strength of the metal, obtained by ex
periments on direct tension, averages only 18,750 lbs.    ; and the dis

                                    433
crepancy and variation will be found to arise from the received
theory not taking into account the resistance consequent on the
molecular disturbance accompanying curvature.
    In his former paper the author gave a formula by which the dif
 ference between the tensile strength       and the apparent resistance       at
 the outer <U+FB01>bre could    be computed, approximatively,        in solid rectan
gular beams and open girders; and he now proposes to trace                  the
operation of the resistance of <U+FB02>exure, considered as a separate ele
ment of strength, and to show its effect, in each of the forms of
section above indicated.     Observing that the usual supposition of only
two resistances in    a beam, tension   and compression, fails to account
either for the strength,    or for the visible    changes of <U+FB01>gure which
take place under transverse strain, he proceeds to discuss the effects
involved in such change of <U+FB01>gure, and thence arrives at the follow
ing conclusions applicable to the resistance of <U+FB02>exure        :_
    1. That it is  a resistance acting   in addition    to the direct exten
sion and to compression.
    2. That it is evenly distributed over the     surface, and consequently
(within the limits of its operation) its points of action will       be at the
centres of gravity of the half-section.
    3. That this uniform resistance is due to the lateral cohesion of
the adjacent surfaces of the <U+FB01>bres or particles, and to the elastic
reaction which thus ensues between the portions of a beam unequally
strained.                                  .
    4. That it is proportional to and varies with the inequality of
strain, as between the <U+FB01>bres or particles nearest the neutral axis and
those most remote.
    Formula:  are then given, according to these principles,       exhibiting
the relation between the straining and resisting forces in the several
forms of section experimented on,      as resulting    from the joint effect
of the resistances of tension, compression and <U+FB02>exure. The appli
cation of these formulae to the actual experiments yields a series of
equations   with numerical coefficients, in which,        were the metal    of
uniform strength, the tensile strength    f;  and the resistance of <U+FB02>exure
¢, would be constant quantities, and their value might be obtained
from any two of the equations; but         as the strength varies even      in
castings of the same dimensions, and        as a reduction   of strength per
unit of section takes place when the thickness      is increased, the values

                                                 434

                  will necessarily vary, and can only                  be ascertained in each
experiment          by <U+FB01>rst establishing           the ratio they bear to each other.
For this purpose the <U+FB01>rst ten experiments                           are used, in all      of which
the metal was from             §   to   1  inch in thickness,             and its mean tensile
strength ascertained by direct experiment to be 18,750 lbs. per inch.
The resulting mean value of                q; is= 16,573 lbs., and the ratio               off to  q)
as   1  to "847.
    By using results obtained by Prof. Hodgkinson on the breaking
weight of inch bars of ten different descriptions                             of iron, where the
tensile strength was ascertained by direct experiment,                                it would  ap
pear that the ratio between the resistance of tension and the resist
ance      of <U+FB01>exure varies in different qualities of metal, an inference
which seems to be con<U+FB01>rmed by other experiments on rectangular
bars given in the Report of the Commissioners                             on the application      of
iron     to   railway     structures.         The       mean       result,     however,     accords
nearly with that of the author’s experiments, and gives the ratio of
f  to  (p  as  l to '853.       Hence, according to these data, the resistance
to <U+FB01>exure, computed as a force evenly distributed                                over the section,
is almost nine-tenths of the tensile resistance.
    This ratio of the values of              f   and   rp  being applied to the equations
resulting from the several experiments, gives the tensile strength of
the metal as derived from each form                           of section, and the results,
though not perfectly regular,                  are    found to be within the limits of
the variation         exhibited by the metal as shown by the experiments
 on    direct tension in the former paper.                        Classi<U+FB01>ed and condensed,

those by Major Wade on the transverse strength of square and round
bars of cast iron of different qualities, related in the “Reports on
the Strength and other Properties of Metals for Cannon,” presented
to the United States Government by the Officers of the Ordnance
Department.        The unit of strength, as computed by Major Wade
from these experiments,        came   out uniformly        much higher in the
round than in the square bars of the         same kind      of iron, whence  he
was led to doubt the correctness of the formula employed ; but the
author shows that when his formula is used, which includes the re
sistance of <U+FB02>exure, the discrepancy referred to disappears, and the
tensile resistance, whether obtained for the round or the square bars,
agrees very nearly with that derived from the experiments on direct
tension under like circumstances.
    As to the ratio between the resistance of <U+FB02>exure and the tensile
resistance, it is remarked that,       were    the metal homogeneous, the
former resistance would probably be precisely equal to the latter, in
stead of bearing the ratio of nine-tenths, as found by experiment; but
the ratio evidently varies in di<U+FB01>'erent qualities of metal; and accord
ingly from Major Wade's experiments, it             appears that with the same
 metal subjected to different     modes of casting, an increase       of trans
 verse strength may accompany a decrease in the tensile resistance.
    Respecting the limit of action of the resistance of <U+FB02>exure, the
 author observes, that in all the simple solid sections, the points of
 action are evidently the centres of gravity of the half-section ; while
 in the compound sections it is    necessary    to compute the centre   rib and
 <U+FB02>anges    as for two separate  beams in which        the resistance of <U+FB02>exure
 is diife-rent, and has its point of action at the centre of gravity of the
 separate portions.      It would appear that the elastic reaction deve
 lopes this resistance to the full extent when the section is such that
 a straight line may be drawn from every point at the outer portion
 to every point at the neutral axis within the section;             but that  if
 the form    of section is such that straight lines drawn from the outer
  <U+FB01>bres or particles to the neutral axis fall without the section, then it
  must be treated as two separate beams, each having that amount of
  resistance of <U+FB02>exure due to the depth of the metal contained in it.
     The last section of the paper is devoted to the consideration of
  the resistance of <U+FB02>exure in wrought iron        ;  and experiments are <U+FB01>rst

                                       436
 given to determine the position of the neutral axis, from which             it is
 found to be at the centre of gravity of the section, as in cast          iron;
 so that    the action is the same in both materials, except as to the
 amount of the extensions and compressions with a given strain            ;   and
 the formulae given for cast iron will also apply to wrought iron.             As
 wrought iron yields by bending and not by fracture, the relative value
 off and    50
               are not so easily ascertained  ;  moreover the ultimate com
 pressive strain which wrought iron can sustain is little more than
 half its ultimate tensile strength ; nevertheless the force required to
 overcome the elasticity of the material is nearly the same, whether
 applied as a compressive or tensile strain      ;  the difference being, that
 the force which overcomes elasticity when applied as a compressive
 strain leads to the destruction      or distortion   of the material, while,
 in the   case  of the tensile strain, the elasticity may    be overcome long
 before the material yields by absolute rupture.
     A  statement is given of the results of experiments made by Pro
 fessor Barlow, in 1837, to show the weights which overcome the
 elasticity of the metal when applied transversely as compared with
 the weight necessary to produce the same result when applied by
 direct tension, and from these it is concluded that the resistance of
<U+FB02>exure in wrought iron, considered as a force acting evenly over the
surface, is nearly equal to one-half of the tensile resistance.
     In  an Appendix to this paper, by Professor Barlow (read            at the
following meeting), the preceding principles           are applied   to beams
and rafters of non-symmetrical section.
    With this view, the      case  of the double-<U+FB02>anged       girder with un
equal <U+FB02>anges is selected and discussed, and formulas deduced, which
are then tested by comparison         with the results of experiments by
Prof. Hodgkinson, published in the ‘ Manchester Memoirs ;’ a selec
tion being made of those in which the girders differed most from
each other in section, dimensions, and bearing-distance.             The chief
particulars of these experiments are given, with diagrams showing
the forms of sections, and the values as obtained from the formulae
are    stated.   The value of the direct tensile strength of         cast   iron
thus derived, falls between the limits of 1400 and 1700.
    In the Reports of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the “Appli
cation of Iron to Railway Structures,” are given the results of about
<U+FB01>fty experiments on the direct tensile resistance of one-inch square

                                            437
  cast-iron    bars, under the direction       of Professor Ilodgkinson.            The
  bars consisted of seventeen          di<U+FB02>'erent kinds of iron, each set of bars
  being   of the like quality and manufacture;                and in several    of these
  sets, which might have been expected to yield the same results, the
  difference is fullyas great as in the cases here exhibited.                From this
  fact an inference may be drawn in favour of the general applicability
 of the principles developed in the foregoing                pages to cast-iron beams
 and girders of every variety of section.

     The explanation of the movements of the Gyroscope                      (as well as
 its mathematical theory) is founded on the principle                   enunciated in

     That  these oscillations   must exist will be evident, when it is con
  sidered that the gyroscope, with the weight        attached  and the disc
  not spinning,    becomes    an  ordinary pendulum:      the effect  of the
  spinning being to disturb its oscillations, and to lessen their extent
  to an unlimited   amount, whenever the spinning       of the disc is su<U+FB02>i
  ciently rapid.
     The preceding investigations,     as well as the experiments,     show
  that whenever a force is applied to the axis of a revolving disc, more
  or less of the momentum       due to this force is converted into a mo
  mentum of rotation parallel to a plane which is perpendicular           to
  that in which the force acts.

  I. “  Researches    on  Silica.” By Colonel PHILIP Yoaxn, F.R.S.
                         Received March 25, 1857.
                                  (Abstract.)
    This communication      is principally devoted to an attempt to de
 termine the formula of silica, and to the relation of some remarkable
results obtained in this research.      After giving  some account   of the
grounds on which the three different formulas           now in use among
chemists (viz. SiO3, SiO2, and SiO) had been advocated, the author
proceeds to state, that it appeared to him that the direct method
which had      been  followed by Rose deserved the preference.         This
method consists in determining       the quantity of carbonic acid which
is displaced from excess of an alkaline carbonate in fusion, by a given

                                                                              'I"

 acid on the hydrogen scale, the equivalent of silicic acid is obtained           .

 by the proportion .z'=
                         weight of carbonic acid expelled‘
    Four experiments are detailed, made with carbonate of potash,
 which give as a mean result the number 30'? for the equivalent of
silica. This agrees with the formula SiO,, and nearly with the
previous results of H. Rose. Then follow seven experiments made
 in a like manner with carbonate of soda, which give as a mean result
the number 2l'3     as the equivalent  of silicic acid—a number       agree
ing nearly with half that represented by the formula      SiO_.,,  or
    Some experiments are then related, which         go to show that the
 increased loss resulting with carbonate of soda could not be caused
 by the action of heat alone.—-The author had next recourse to car
 bonate of lithia, and obtained as the mean result of four experi
 ments with this substance, agreeing well together, the number 1499
 —a number which accords very closely with the formula                 SiO.
 These different   numbers, obtained with silica, led the author to in
 quire whether any other body acting’ as an acid produces similar re
 sults with the fused carbonates of potash and soda.      With this view,
 experiments mere made with dry sulphate of magnesia, as a substi
tute for sulphuric acid, with bi-borate of soda, for boracic acid, with
alumina and sesquioxide of iron.      Of these bodies only boracic acid
gave results similar   to those obtained with silicic acid.       The other
substances all gave the equivalent numbers usually assigned to them,
equally with the carbonates of potash and soda.
    Directing his attention then to determine whether the equivalent
of silicic acid could be found in other volatile acids than the carbonic,
the author relates some experiments       made     with the hydrates of
potash and soda, but he explains that there are circumstances which
render    it much more difficult to obtain accordant numbers with
these bodies than with the carbonates.
    Six experiments made with hydrate of potash gave as mean result
the same number as that obtained with the carbonate, viz. 308.
But with hydrate of soda the mean of three experiments gave the
number l7'2 as the equivalent of silicic acid,-a result approaching
that previously obtained with carbonate of lithia.

                                          442
      A  silicate of soda was formed by fusing together silica and carbo
   nate of soda, in proportions indicated by the previous experiments—
  i. e. 23 silica to 54 carbonate of soda          = 31 soda.      The fused    mass
  was crystallized.       It was dissolved    in water, and the solution evapo
  rated in vacuo yielded         a  crystallized salt, which contained about
  5 per cent.     of carbonate of soda; when this, calculated            as the or
  dinary     l0-hydrated salt, was subtracted, the silicate agreed nearly
  with the formula NaO . SiO2+ 7HO.                  A crystallized salt of like
  composition was obtained when hydrated silica was dissolved in a
  solution     of caustic  soda,   the silica and soda      being    in the    same
  proportions,     i. e. 31  :23.    In  these experiments it appears, there
  fore, that in the process of solution          and crystallization   a portion  of
  soda is extruded.      When exposed to a temperature of about 300° F.,
  nearly all the water was driven off from these salts, less than 1 per
  cent. remaining.
     The fused silicate of lithia in like manner, when treated with water,
 appeared to split up into different compounds.
     After guarding himself from drawing any decided inference from
 the experiments recorded, the author concludes by observing that at
 present he can see no alternative but to admit of more than one
 equivalent for silicic acid (that is to say of more than one acid), the
 value of which is determined by circumstances,—such as the presence
 of water and the nature of the         base to    which it is presented.       The
 existence of such different silicic acids has been already suggested            by
 chemists on different grounds, particularly by Ebelman and Laurent,
 and lately by      M. Fremy.

     Some time ago, on the publication               of  a paper       read   by me last
 summer       at   Cheltenham       before the Mathematical             Section      of the
 British Association on Parabolic Trigonometry and the Geometrical
 origin of Logarithms, Sir John Herschel called my attention to the
 analogy which exists between the equation of the common catenary
 referred to rectangular coordinates, and one of the principal formula:
 of parabolic trigonometry.             Since that time     I  have partially investi
 gated the subject, and <U+FB01>nd, on a very cursory examination, that the
 most curious analogies exist between the properties of the parabola
 and those of the catenary,—that             in general for every property            of the
 former     a corresponding        one may be     discovered for the latter.               In
 this paper      I  cannot do more than give a mere outline                       of these
 investigations,     but   I   hope at some       future     time, when less           occu
 pied with other avocations than at present,                 I  may be permitted to
 resume the subject.            I  will only add, that the properties of this
 curve     appear to be as        inexhaustible as those of the circle or any
 other conic section.

coordinates are

The point 0 may         be called the focus, whose distance to the vertex                   A
of the     curve is =m.
     It  will simplify the investigations, without lessening their                     gene
rality, if we assume the modulus or focal distance m= 1.

n times that         of the other, the nth power of the sum of the ordinate and

   We may graphically exhibit with great simplicity the sum of a
series of angles added together by the parabolic or logarithmic

     Let    a set       of equidistant ordinates—for simplicity let the common
interval be             unity—meet the catenary in the points b, c, d,     and                               ls,l,

Hence the angle AO/3 or                         s   is   such that

consequently             if    we draw lines from                    the focus           0     successively to the
points      B,    -y,    8,   x,    A,   the angles A0/3,                A0y, A05, AOK, A0)\ will                      be
the angles          1,   i-Ls, s-La-Le, :4.-e-I-s-I-s.
     This    is    one       of the simplest graphical representations                                   we can have
of angles added together by the parabolic or logarithmic plus -1-.
   Hence as successive multiples of an arc of   circle give successive                   a
arithmetical                    of the corresponding angle at the centre, so

“ On the Magnetic Induction of Crystals.” By Professor ULIUS         J
       Pliicxnn, of Bonn, For. Memb. R.S., Hon.M.R.I., &c.
       Received March 26, 1857.
                                  [Abstract]
    The author commences by referring to his discovery of the peculiar
action of magnets on crystalline bodies, and to the researches to
which he was thereby led.         With reference to the form in which he
enunciated the law regulating the action of a magnet on a uniaxal
crystal—that the optic axis is attracted or repelled by the poles of
the magnet—he disclaims any intention of assigning a physical cause
to the phenomenon,        or doing anything    more than expressing the
results of observation, which are as     if such  a force existed.     In the
case  of crystals of  a more complicated     character,   he was led, in the
<U+FB01>rst instance, to  assume the existence   of two magnetic axes, possessing
a  similar character   as to attraction and repulsion with the one axis of
optically uniaxal crystals.      But <U+FB01>nding that the proposed law did
not hold when the crystal was examined in all directions, and not
solely along peculiar     axes,  he abandoned, nearly      two years ago, a
hypothesis    respecting which serious doubts had arisen long before.
For the hypothesis      of  one  or two axes acted upon by the magnet,
he substituted    another similar hypothesis.      In   the case of uniaxal
crystals he now conceived an ellipsoid        of revolution,    consisting   of
an amorphous paramagnetic          or diamagnetic  substance, and having
within the crystal its principal axis coincident with the principal
crystallographic    axis.    It is easy to verify   that   both crystal    and
ellipsoid,  the poles of the magnet not being too near each other,

 will    be directed           between them in exactly the same way.                           In the
generalization,         an ellipsoid with three unequal axes, having a deter
minate direction in the crystal, must be substituted for the ellipsoid
of revolution.            In this hypothesis too, two " magnetic                        axes
                                                                                               ” are
met with, that           is,   according     to the new de<U+FB01>nition, directions which
possess,       in common with the single crystallographic                       axis    of uniaxal
crystals, the property that                if   the crystal be suspended so that either
of these         axes   is   vertical, and the body            is   at liberty to turn freely
round      it,   no extraordinary          magnetic action          is   exhibited, but the cry
stal behaves like an amorphous substance.
     According to observation,              a   crystal under favourable circumstances
is   directed in the same way as the smallest of its fragments.                            Hence,
according        to the new hypothesis, each       of its particles may be regarded
as acted on       like an      amorphous ellipsoid. But such an amorphous mole
cular ellipsoid, when in<U+FB02>uenced by magnetic pole at <U+FB01>nite distance,

will be directed like an ellipsoid of <U+FB01>nite dimensions under the in
<U+FB02>uence of an in<U+FB01>nitely distant pole.                    Here Poisson's theory presented
itself for the veri<U+FB01>cation                of the hypothetical            conclusions    and their
consequences, to which the author had been led by considerations of                                a
different kind.          This veri<U+FB01>cation had the most complete                    success.      But
                                  it,
before proceeding to              it       was found necessary to con<U+FB01>rm Poisson’s
theory itself (or rather the results following from it), with respect to
an ellipsoid of <U+FB01>nite dimensions in<U+FB02>uenced by an in<U+FB01>nitely distant
pole.      By     means      of   a   beautiful theorem lately published by Professor
Beer,     by   which      the results relating              to the in<U+FB02>uenced       ellipsoid     are
simply and elegantly expressed by                       means    of      an auxiliary   ellipsoid,
the author was enabled to deduce immediately the analytical expreg
sions.  These were afterwards compared with experiment, by obser
vations made on two carefully worked ellipsoids of soft iron, executed
by M. Fessel of Cologne.                                       _

  crystal be suspended along any one of them, the two others set, one
  axially, and the other equatorially.        As there     are  two optic axes,
  situated in the plane of the axes of greatest and least elasticity, so
  there are two magnetic axes, characterized         by the property already
  mentioned.
      Among crystals, the author selected for special examination red
  ferrocyanide of iron, sulphate of zinc, and formicate of copper. The
  <U+FB01>rst is paramagnetic, the second diamagnetic, and in both cases the
  principal axes of magnetic induction are determined by the planes of
  crystalline symmetry.        The setting of elongated prisms, as well as
  of long cylinders and short cylinders or circular plates, cut invarious
  selected directions from the crystals, is described in detail.        The use
  of both cylinders        and circular plates, cut with their axes       in the
  same direction, obviated any objection which might be raised attri
  buting the setting to the external form, since, so far as was due to
  mere form, a cylinder and a circular plate would set with their axes
  in rectangular directions.
      Formicate of copper differs from the former crystals in having but
  one plane of crystalline symmetry, and accordingly in having but one
  principal axis of magnetic induction determined by the crystalline
   form.      The existence of three principal magnetic axes, having the
   property already mentioned,       was demonstrated experimentally,        and
   the directions    of those two which were not determined by the cry
   stalline form, were ascertained by experiment.           In  this crystal the
   axes   of greatest and least induction, and consequently the magnetic
   axes,   lie in the plane of symmetry; and the existence of two mag
   netic axes was demonstrated, and their positions were determined.
      In conclusion,   the author gives a list of crystals, classi<U+FB01>ed according
   to their paramagnetic      or diamagnetic    characters, and the order of
   magnitude of the magnetic inductions         in the direction of their prin
   cipal axes.      He also remarks that   some crystals,    of which instances
   are given,    though belonging according to their form to the biaxal
   class, have two of their principal magnetic inductions so nearly
   equalithat they cannot be distinguished from magnetically uniaxal
   crystals‘; while others, though not belonging to the tesseral system,
   have   all their principal inductions   so nearly equal that they cannot
   be distinguished     from amorphous substances.

the quantity            of air inspired was read off                 at the end       of      every   <U+FB01>ve

recorded every quarter of an hour.   The <U+FB01>rst inquiry was made on
July        7   and 8, 1856, the second on January 19 and 20, l857, and
the third on January 21, 1857.
     The maximum in<U+FB02>uence of various agents                           was determined both by
the quantity of air inspired taken absolutely, and also relatively to
that recorded immediately before the influence in question was
exerted.  The inquiries were made before breakfast, or at periods
distant at least three hours from the last meal, so as to avoid the
disturbing in<U+FB02>uence of food. Exertion, variation of posture, mental
inquietude; change of temperature, &c., were avoided during the
continuance of each inquiry, and hence the observations were never
continued beyond a period of two hours.                               The quantity of air was
determined during periods of <U+FB01>ve minutes at a time, twice during the
-<U+FB01>rst quarter        of   an hour, and once at the commencement                          of   each suc
ceeding quarter of an hour.                 The results were              averaged    per minute.
     In all       the above-mentioned inquiries                  the rate of respiration and
pulsation and the temperature of the wet and dry bulbs with the
barometric pressure were recorded.
   The temperature of the breath was determined by the aid of an
instrument consisting of a boxwood tube a} of an inch in diameter and
1%   inch in length, through the                 sides      of which and at          a   right angle
to   it,   a    small thermometer was inserted and the bulb exposed freely
to the exhaled breath.              A     valve was placed at the distal end which
permitted          the exit of the breath,               but prevented the entrance of
air, whilst near to the end which was placed between the lips when
in   use,   a    valve was <U+FB01>xed which moved in both directions.                               The bulb
of the thermometer           was thus enclosed              in   a   small chamber.
     The paper concludes with              a    summary of the principal results ob

 tained and a series     of deductions, applicable especially        to the solution
 or elucidation of hygienic questions.            From the former the following
 facts are extracted     :—
    The total quantity of air inspired in 24 hours (allowance being
made for intervals amounting altogether to 40 minutes, during
which   it was not recorded)      was 711,060 cub. ins.        ;  or an average        of
29,627 cub. ins. per hour and 49313 per minute.                  The quantity was
much less during the night than during the day.                      There was an
increase as the morning advanced and a decrease at about 8" 80' r.1v|.,
but most suddenly at about          ll   P.M.     During the day the quantity
increased immediately after a meal, and then subsided before the
next meal ; but in every instance it rose again immediately before a
meal.     The   rate  of frequency of respiration generally corresponded
with the quantity, but the extremes of the day and night rates were
greater.    The period of greatest parallelism was between tea and
supper.     An increase was occasioned by one meal only, namely break
fast.   The    average    depth of respiration was 26'?) cub. ins., with a
minimum of 18'l cub. ins. in the night, and a maximum of 32-2 cub.
ins. at 1" 30' P.M. The mean rate of the pulse was 76 per minute,
the minimum        at 3" 30' A.M., the maximum at 8" 45' A.M. ; the                  dif
ference being more than one-third of the minimum rate.
    Sleep came on in two of the series of continuous observations, and
the time of its occurrence was also that of the lowest quantities of
air inspired.
    The amount of breathing        was greater in the standing than               in the
sitting posture, and greater sitting than lying.            It   was increased        by
riding on horseback, according to the pace, also by riding in or upon
an omnibus.        In railway travelling the increase was greater i“ 9'
second- than in a <U+FB01>rst-class carriage, and greatest in the thi1'd'°laS5
and on the engine.            An increase was also produced by l'°wi“8
                                                                                and de

    depth of respiration                was greatly         increased by great heat.                 An in
    crease     in quantity was caused also by cold bathing, and sponging,
    and the cold shower-bath;                   by breakfast, dinner, and tea—when                        tea
    actually     was        taken, but when coffee                was      substituted      there was a
    decrease.        Supper of bread and milk also caused a decrease.                                   Milk
    by itself or with suet caused an increase.
      An increase was obtained with the following articles of diet, viz.
    eggs, beef-steak,    jelly, white bread (home-made), oatmeal, potatoes,
    sugar, tea,     rum (1 oz.). The following caused a decrease, viz. butter,
    fat of beef, olive oil, cod-liver oil, arrow-root, brandy (1 oz. to 1% oz.),
    and kirchenwasser.        Ether              (315

    morphia       (-5   and      %   gr.), tartarized antimony              (%,~   gr.), and chloride of
    sodium.
      Carbonate of ammonia (15 grains) caused    small increase at <U+FB01>rst    a
    and then   small decrease; febrifuge medicines had
                 a                                          like effect.                  a
    Chloroform (2501 and 5ss), by the stomach, varied the quantity
    from an average increase of 28 cub. ins. to an average decrease of
    20 cub. ins. per minute; with                       a   maximum        increase of 63 cub. ins.
per minute.         Chloric ether (3ss) also varied the quantity, but there
                        _
    was   an average increase of 17 cub. ins. per minute, and of 1'8 per
    minute, in the rate; whilst the pulse fell on the average 1'7 per min.
    Chloroform, by inhalation (to just short of unconsciousness), lowered
    the quantity        a    little during the inhalation,              and more so afterwards.
The rate was unchanged, but the pulse fell, on an                                      average,      17 per
min.           Amylene similarly administered                       and       to the      same       degree,
increased the quantity during inhalation                            60 cub. ins. per min., but
afterwards decreased                   it   to 100 cub. ins. per min.                  less than during
the inhalation.           The rate of respiration was unchanged: the pulse
fell      6   per min. at the end of the observation.
      Digitalis (infusion                    varied the quantity,                  increasing   it   at <U+FB01>rst
and then decreasing it. The rate of inspiration was unaffected,
whilst that of pulsation somewhat increased.

    The following communications               were read    :—
 I. “ On the Plasticity of Ice, as manifested in Glaciers.” By
       J  AMES THOMSON, A.M., C.E. Belfast.                  Communicated by
       Professor W. THoMsoN, F.R.S.                   Received April 1, 1857.
    The object of this communication is             to lay before the  Royal   SQ
ciety a theory which        I  have  to propose for explaining      the plasticity
of ice at the freezing point, which         is shown by observations by      Pro
fessor   James Forbes, and which          is the principle     of his Theory of
Glaciers.
   This speculation occurred to        me mainly in or ah0ut the year 1848.
I  was led    to it  from a previous theoretical deduction at Whi<U+FB02>h         I  had
arrived,    namely, that the freezing point of water, ‘)1’ the melting
point of ice, must vary with the pressure to which the Water °' the

                                                    456
    ice is subjected, the temperatureof freezing or melting being lowered
    as the pressure is increased.   My theory on that subject is to be
    found in a paper by me, entitled “ Theoretical Considerations on the
    Eifect of Pressure in Lowering the Freezing Point of Water,” pub
    lished in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. xiv.
    part 5, 1849*.           It   is there inferred that the lowering of the freezing
    point, for one additional             atmosphere        of pressure, must          be   '0075°
.   ccntigrade;      and that      if the     pressure above one atmosphere be denoted
    in atmospheres as units by n, the lowering of the freezing point,
    denoted in degrees centigrade by t, will be expressed by the formula
                                               t= -0075    n.
       The phenomena which                I   there predicted, in anticipation          of direct
    observations, were afterwards fully established by experiments made
    by my brother, Professor William Thomson, and described in a paper
    by him, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edin
    burgh (Feb. 1850) under the title, “The Effect of Pressure in
    lowering the Freezing Point of Water experimentally   demon
    strated']'.'_’
       The principle of the lowering of the freezing point by pressure
    being laid down as a basis,                I   now proceed to offer my explanation,
    derived from       it,    of the plasticity           of ice at the freezing point          as
    follows   :—
       If to amass     of ice at 0° centigrade, which may                be supposed at the
    outset to be slightly porous, and to contain small quantities of liquid
    water diffused through its substance, forces tending                         to change its
    form be applied, whatever portions of                  it   may thereby be subjected to
    compression will instantly have their melting point lowered so as to
    be below their existing temperature                    of 0° cent.     Melting of those
    portions will therefore set in throughout                     their substance, and this
    will   be accompanied by  fall of temperature in them on account of
                                      a
    the cold evolved in the liquefaction.  The lique<U+FB01>ed portions being
    subjected to squeezing of the compressed mass in which they origi
    nate, will spread themselves out through the pores of the general
      * The    paper here referred to       is   also to be found in the Cambridge and Dublin
    Mathematical Journal for November 1850 (vol. v. p. 248), where                it   was repub
    lished with some slight alterations made by myself.

                                              4-57'
mass, by dispersion from the regions of greatest to those                           of   least
<U+FB02>uid pressure.            Thus the fluid pressure is relieved in those portions
in which        the compression        and liquefaction        of the    ice had set in,
accompanied   by the lowering of temperature.   On the removal of
this cause of liquidity—the <U+FB02>uid pressure, namely,—the cold which
had been evolved in the compressed parts of the ice and water, freezes
the water again in new positions, and thus a change of form, or
plastic       yielding    of theof ice to the applied pressures, has
                                   mass
occurred. The newly-formed ice is at <U+FB01>rst free from the stress of
the applied forces, but the yielding of one part always leaves some
other part exposed to the pressure, and that, in its turn, acts in like
manner; and, on the whole,                a continual    succession     goes on     of pres
sures being applied to particular parts—liquefaction  in those parts
dispersion of the water so produced, in such directions as will relieve
its pressure,—and recongelation, by the cold previously evolved, of
the water on its being relieved from this pressure.                      Thus the parts
recongealed after having been melted must, in their turn, through the
yielding of other parts, receive pressures from the applied forces,
thereby to be again lique<U+FB01>ed, and to enter again on a similar cycle of
operations. The succession of these processes must continue as long
as the external forces tending to change of form remain applied to
the mass of porous ice permeated by minute quantities of water.
                     POSTSCRIPT received 22nd April, 1857.
     It   will be observed that in the course of the foregoing communica
tion,     I
         have supposed the ice under consideration to be porous, and
to   contain small quantities of liquid water diffused through. its sub
stance.  Porosity and permeation by liquid water are generally
understood, from the results of observations, and from numerous
other reasons,           to be normal       conditions   of glacier ice-       It   is   110%
however,       necessary for the purposes of my 8xplu,nati01‘l              of the plas
ticity of     ice at the freezing point, that the ice should be at the               0\1tS6t
in this condition;         for, even   if   we commence        with the    ¢0I1Sid9\'”-tl°I1

            and the fact that ice cannot exist at 0° cent. under a pressure exceed
            ing that of the atmosphere.   I would also wish to make it distinctly
            understood that no part of the ice, even if supposed at the outset to

            water squeezed       against   it from such parts         as   may be directly sub
            jected to the pressure, because            the very fact of that water being
            forced against any portions             of the ice supposed to be solid will
            instantly subject them to pressure, and so will cause melting to set
            in throughout their substance, thereby reducing them immediately
            to the porous condition.
               Thus it is     a matter     of indifference        as to whether we commence
            with the supposition of        a mass     of porous or of solid ice.

               In my last communication               to the Royal Society on the Meta
            morphic Silurian Strata of Canada,            I   endeavoured to show, from the
            results of analyes of the altered and unaltered rocks, that it is the
            reaction between the siliceous matters and the carbonates of lime,
            magnesia, and iron of the sedimentary deposits, which has given rise
            to the serpentines, tales, pyroxenites, chlorites, and garnet rocks                    of
            the formation.       I   then cited the observation of Bischof that silica,
            even in the form of pulverized quartz, slowly decomposes these car
            bonates at a temperature of 212° F., with evolution of carbonic acid ;

       Colourless crystalline quartz was ignited, <U+FB01>nely pulverized, and
   then boiled for an hour with a solution of its weight of
                                                                                perfectly
   pure carbonate of soda           ,- the amount of silica thus dissolved was 1'5
   per cent.      of  the quartz, but on repeating the treatment of the same
   quartz with a second portion of the carbonate, only '35 per ¢gn¢_ was
   dissolved.        The object of this process was to remove any soluble
   Silica, and the quartz thus puri<U+FB01>ed was employed for the
                                                                              following
   experiments, which were performed in a vessel of platinum.
       I. 1000 parts of quartz and 200 of carbonate of soda were boiled
  with water for ten hours, and the mixture                 was several times evapo
  rated to dryness, and exposed for a few minutes to a temperature of
  about 300° F.            The amount of silica taken into solution was 12
  parts.
      II. A      hydro-carbonate of magnesia was prepared by mingling
  hoiling solutions of sulphate of magnesia and carbonate of potash,
  the latter in excess;           the precipitate    was   washed by boiling with
 successive portions         of  water.    1000   parts of quartz were mixed with
 about as much of this magnesian carbonate and boiled as above for
 ten     hours.       An   excess   of hydrochloric acid      was  then added,       the
 whole evaporated to dryness, and the magnesian salt washed out with
 dilute acid.         The residue     was then boiled for a few minutes with car
 bonate     of   soda, and gave 33 parts of soluble silica.
     III.     A  mixture of 1000 parts of quartz, 200 of carbonate of soda
 with water, and an excess of carbonate of magnesia was boiled for
 ten hours, and the residue, treated          as in the last experiment, gave 148
 parts    of   soluble silica.       The alkaline liquid contained a little mag.
 nesia but no silica in solution.            That the soluble silica was really
 combined with magnesia was shown by boiling the insoluble mixture
 with sal-ammoniac, which, dissolving the carbonate, left a large
 amount       of  magnesia with the silica.      This silicate  was readily decom
posed      by hydrochloric acid, the greater part of the silica separating
in a pulverulent form.
    The third experiment           was suggested by some ohserv<U+FB02>tif<U+FB02>ls         On the
reactions      of silicate  of soda with earthy carbonates.         K<U+FB02>hlmann ha!

exerts a similar action.        I have found that when arti<U+FB01>cial carbonate
of magnesia in      excess is boiled   with   a solution    of silicate of   soda,‘ the
latter is completely decomposed with the formation                  of carbonate of
soda, and a silicate      of magnesia which gelatinizes with acids ; and I
have long since described this reaction in the evaporation of alkaline
mineral waters*.          This mutual decomposition of carbonate of mag
nesia and silicate of soda, conjoined with the power of carbonate                       of
 soda to dissolve silica, leads to a curious result.            If we boil    for some
 hours a mixture of ignited silica, obtained from the decomposition                     of
 a silicate  by an acid (and consequently readily soluble in an alkaline
 carbonate), with a small portion of carbonate of soda and an excess of
 hydrocarbonate of magnesia, we obtain a dense powder which contains
 all the silica united with magnesia, and may be boiled with carbonate
 of soda and sal-ammoniac without decomposition.                  It is obvious from
 the above      experiments     that similar    results may be obtained with
 quartz, although the process is much slower             ;  it would doubtless be
 accelerated under         pressure at a somewhat           elevated temperature,
 which would enhance the solvent power of the alkaline carbonate.
     Silicates of potash and soda are everywhere present in sedimentary
 rocks, where decomposing          felspathic    materials     are seldom wanting,
 and these salts in the presence of a mixture                 of quartz and earthy
 carbonates, aided by a gentle heat, will serve            to effect a union of the
 quartz with the earthy bases, eliminating              carbonic acid.         A small
 amount of alkali may thus, like a leaven, continue its operation in
 de<U+FB01>nitely and change the character            of  a great mass      of sedimentary
 rock.      Such a process is not only a possible but a              necessary result
 under the circumstances          supposed, and we cannot,           I  th_ir_ik,_4‘doubt
 that alkaline silicates play a very important part in the metamorphism
 of sedimentary rocks, which are composed for the most part of earthy
 carbonates, with siliceous, aluminous, and felspathic materials)‘.
     The direct action between the carbonates and silica must neces
 sarily be limited by their mutual insolubility, and by the protecting
 in<U+FB02>uence of the <U+FB01>rst-formed         portions of earthy silicate; but with the
 solvent action of a small portion of alkali which is changed from

     The following objects are contemplated in this paper :—
     lst. The demonstration of a fundamental theorem for the sum
mation of integrals whose limits        are determined by the roots   of  an
algebraic equation.
     2ndly. The application     of that theorem to the comparison          of
algebraical    transcendents.
     3rdly. Its application to the comparison of functional transcendents,
i.  e. of transcendents in the differential expression of which an arbi
trary functional sign is involved.
     4t_hly.  Certain extensions of the theory of de<U+FB01>nite integrals    both
single and multiple, founded upon the results       of the application last
mentioned.
     In  the expression of the fundamental theorem for the summation
of integrals, the author introduces      a symbol, 9, similar in its de<U+FB01>ni
tion to the symbol employed by Cauchy in the Calculus of Residues,
but involving an additional element. The interpretation of this
symbol is not arbitrary, but is suggested by the results of the inves
tigation by which the theorem of summation is obtained.             All the
general theorems demonstrated in the memoir            either involve   this
symbol in their expression, or are     immediate consequences of theorems
into the expression of which it enters.
    The author directly applies his theorem of summation both to the
solution of particular problems in the comparison of the algebraical
transcendants,      and to the deduction    of general theorems.    Of   the  ll

        Hancocx, Esq.          Communicated by T. H. HUXLEY, Esq.,
        F.R.S.      Received    April 24, 1857.
                                    (Abstract.)
     In the present memoir the author states at length, and fully illus
 trates by <U+FB01>gures, the conclusions to which he has been led by a long
 series of researches into the anatomyof the Brachiopoda;          investigations
 which have     been conducted     with  a special reference to the discrepant
opinions maintained by Prof. Owen and the older writers on the one
hand, and by Prof. Huxley and himself on the other.                  Some of the
points in dispute have already been discussed in a paper read before
the British Association at Cheltenham, and in the present memoir
the author not merely reiterates the statements which he then made,
but gives    a detailed account     of the whole organization of the Bra
chiopoda based upon his dissections of the following species :— Wald
heimia australis, W. Cranium, Terebratulina caput-serpentie, RIt_1/n
ckonella psittacea,     Lingula anatina, and another       species  of Lingula.
    The Brachiopoda       are divisible   into two groups, according as the
valves of their shells are    articulated or not.     Waldkeimia is the type
of the former group, Lingula of the latter.

                                       464
    In  the articulated forms there are usually three apertures opening
into the pallial chamber       ; of these  one is the  mouth,—the other two
are situated at the apices of the organs which have been described as
“hearts.”       In  Rhynchonella,     where there are four such “pseudo
hearts,” there are of course <U+FB01>ve apertures instead of three.             In Din
gula, which      possesses  a distinct‘ anus, opening      on the right side   of
 the pallial cavity, the apertures into the cavity are four, viz. one oral,
 one anal, and two appertaining        to the pseudo-hearts.
     After a description   of the general arrangement of the organs in the
 articulated   and non-articulated     Brachiopoda,    an elaborate account     of
 the various systems of organs is given.
     The muscles of the Terebratulidae         are divisible according to   their
 functions into two groups,—-the          adductors of the valves, and those
 which adjust the shell upon the pedicle.             Of the former, or “val
 vular” muscles, there      are three pairs,——the adductors, cardinals, and
  accessory cardinals of previous writers; which the author prefers to
 term occlusors, divaricaiors, and accessory divaricators.          Of the latter
 there are likewise three pairs, the so-called dorsal and ventral pedicle
 muscles and the capsular muscle         ; these the author terms the      dorsal
  and ventral atfjustors, and the peduncular muscle.            The attachment
 of the muscles in Waldheimia australis and their actions               are par
 ticularly described.      The peduncular‘ (capsular) muscle is shown to
  be  the continuation of the musculari<U+FB01>bres contained within the pe
  duncle.   In the other articulated Brachiopoda examined, the arrange
  ment of the muscles is essentially the same, but interesting di<U+FB01>'er
  ences are observable even      in closely allied species.
     Thus, in   a species  differing but little from Waldheirrfla auatralis,
  and in W. Cranium,       the divaricators     and accessory divaricators     are
  united.    In Waldheimia Cranium         and Terebratulina caput-aerpentis
  the dorsal adjustor muscles are not attached to a hinge-plate, but are
  inserted into the valve/itself.       In  Rhynchonella    paittacea there is a
  pair of peduncular muscles. In Lingula there are six pairs of muscles,
  all of which have both extremities attached to the valves. They have
  been divided into adductors and sliding muscles, the latter again being
  subdivided    into protractors     and    retractors; but the author,      con
  sidering that no sliding motion takes place, regards the latter terms
  as improper,    and gives a set of new names, of which a concordance
  with the older denominations is subjoined.

                                Posterior parictals.
    The author conceives that the valves are separated by the action
of the divaricators, combined with that of the parietals ; these
muscles compressing the visceral cavity posteriorly,                      and thus driving
its contents into the anterior portion.                 The antagonists of         these are
the occlusors     ;  while the office of the adjusters appears rather to be
to supply the place of a hinge, and to prevent anything like sliding
of the valves     one over the other.
    The muscular <U+FB01>bres of Lingula                 are    smooth and unstriated.           In
 Waldheimia those of the posterior occlusors                    are strongly striated, but
 the rest of the muscles have smooth <U+FB01>bres.                       The arms, their attach
 ment and minute structure are next fully described.
    In  lVala'heimia      the canals of the attached portions                  of the arms
 coalesce into a single wide tube, which lies externally between the
 produced and re<U+FB02>ected crura of the calcareous loop, and is separated
 by   a partition from a canal of corresponding                      size—the      “brachial
 sinus,”——which ‘also extends throughout                  the whole length of the pro
 duced and re<U+FB02>ected crura, and is in fact a prolongation of the peri
 visceral chamber.          The cirri      are arranged         in this and all the other
 Brachiopoda      examined, in a double alternating series—not in a single
 row, as has hitherto been stated to be the case.                         The walls of the
 brachial    canal are tolerably          well supplied          with delicate muscular
  <U+FB01>bres, which run diagonally round the tube, and are most strongly
 developed towards the sides, near the grooved ridge which supports
  the cirri.     An indistinct band of exceedingly delicate longitudinal
  <U+FB01>bres may also be observed nearly opposite to it.                        The author has
  however completely failed to discover, either here or in Rlzynchonella,
  anything    like the double spiral arrangements of <U+FB01>bres described by

                                           466
  Prof. Owen, and believes that the latter observer has mistaken the
  blood-seinuss for muscles.
     The author doubts whether the spiral coil can              be unwound,    and
  conceives that the muscular <U+FB01>bres described, are chie<U+FB02>y for the             pur
  pose  of giving <U+FB01>rm support to the grooved ridge on which the cirri
                                         and thus affording the complex mus
-
  and brachial    fold are seated,
  cular <U+FB01>bres which the ridge contains a better fulcrum whence to act
                                                                       I
  upon the cirri.
     In Terebratulina          caput-serpentia,   which  possesses  no calcareous
  loop, the pallial lobe connecting the produced and re<U+FB02>ected portions
  of the arms is strengthened by calcareous spicula, which are so
  numerous as to preserve the shape of the part even when the animal
                                       '
  basis is removed.
     In Lingula     the arms contain two canals;         one, the anterior,  being
  the equivalent of the single canal in Rhynchonella,            and, like it, ter
  minating at the side of the (esophagus in a blind sac.             The posterior
  brachial canal probably communicates with the perivisceral cavity and
  exhibits a peculiar arrangement of muscles, by whose action perhaps
  the arm can be exserted.
     In  addition to those parts of the alimentary canal and its append
  ages  which   are already known          in the articulated Brachiopoda,     the
  author describes a short median gastro-parietal band arising from the
  upper surface of the stomach and passing upwards and backwards to
  the dorsal parietes a little in advance of the hinge-plate.                With
  regard to the existence or absence          of an anal aperture in the articu
  lated Brachiopoda,        the writer states:    “ I have  made   numerous    dis
  sections under a powerful doublet, and have removed the part and
  examined it with a microscope: I have <U+FB01>lled the tube with <U+FB02>uid
  as the <U+FB01>ngers    of  a glove    with air, and by pressure have attempted to
  force a passage:        I  have tried injections; but have equally, on all
  occasions, failed to discover an outlet, and have only succeeded               in
  demonstrating      more and more clearly the caecal nature of the ter
  minal   extremity       of the alimentary      canal.   Therefore,   how much
  soever it may be opposed to analogy and to authority,             the fact must
  be recorded—there          is no anal ori<U+FB01>ce in Walollzeimia, Terebratulina,
  or in R/zynchonella."
     In Lingula,     as   in the articulated Brachiopoda, the <U+FB01>rst in<U+FB02>ection
   of the intestine     is towards the ventral      surface, but the alimentary

                                                                                qr

  canal eventually ends in the easily observable anus placed nearer the
                                                                              ‘
  dorsal than the ventral surface, on the right side of the body.        The
  rudimentary mesentery, and the lateral gastro-parietal and ilio-parietal
  bands of Lingula are described.       There is no median gastro-parietal
  band. Faecal matter rolled into round pellets is commonly obser
  vable in the intestine    of Lingula, while no   faeces are ever found in
  that of the articulated Brachiopoda.
      The genitalia in the articulate Brachiopoda    are developed between
_ the two membranes of which the inner wall of the pallial        sinuses  in
  which they are contained is composed, and, thrusting the inner of the
  two membranes from the outer, form a prominent mass connected by
  a band with the inferior wall of the sinus.       The genital artery runs
  along the upper or outer edge of the band, and the genitalia are
  developed   round it.
      In Lingula   the reproductive  organs are Withdrawn from the man
  tle and lodged within the visceral chamber, forming four irregularly
  lobulated or branched masses, two above and two below the alimen
  tary canal, so that they may be distinguished as dorsal and ventral
  genital masses. The dorsal ovaries are suspended by the ilio-parietal
  bands, and the ventral by the continuation      of  these bands along the
   free margins of the pseudo-hearts.      In both cases the attachment is
   along the margins of the bands, which are related to the genitalia
   much in the same manner as the suspending membrane is to the
  genital bands in Waldheimia; and it would seem that in I/ingula
   the reproductive organs are really developed between the two layers
   composing the ilio-parietal   bands.    The author adduces arguments
   to show that the Lingulae    are hermaphrodite,   the testis being a red
                                                                      ‘
   dish mass, which rami<U+FB01>es over the true ovary.
      The ova probably make their way out by the so-called “ hearts,”
   which open by their apices into the pallial cavity, and by their patu
   lous bases (the so-called auricles) into the perivisceral  chamber, and
   are hence capable of performing       the functions   of oviducts.    The
   author has assured himself of the constant presence of the apical
   aperture of the pseudo-heart in all Brachiopoda.       As pointed out by
   Prof. Huxley, there are four of these pseudo-hearts in R/tynchonella,
   but only two were found in the other Brachiopoda examined.
      The pseudo-hearts have nothing to do with the propulsion of the
   blood, a function which is performed chie<U+FB02>y by the pyriform vesicle

heart are vessels          or blood-channels           (particularly described in the
Memoirs)         ;   the “ venous canals,” which open into it anteriorly,

     Accessory “hearts             pulsatile vesicles have             been found
of the articulated Brachiopoda; the mantle and the walls of the body
are essentially composed            of substance traversed by reticu
                                    of   a plate
lated lacunae, and lined upon each side with epithelium.     After ex
plaining at length the distribution of the lacunae throughout the
mantle, the sheath of the intestine, its hands, the genital folds, the
arms, &c., the author proceeds to give the following sketch of the
course of the circulation:—
     “ Having now gone over all that               I   have been able to ascertain with
respect to the central and peripheral portions of the circulatory appa
ratus, and having also examined the lacunes and blood-canals                            of the
brachial organs,         it will not     be   di<U+FB01>icult to follow the <U+FB02>ow of the blood
throughout           its entire course in Waldheimia; and as it is in                     it,   so
will   it   be   in all probability in all other Brachiopods.
     “It    has been shown that the heart                is   a   simple, unilocular,     pyri
form vesicle, suspended from the dorsal aspect of the stomach, and
projecting freely into the perivisceral chamber;                      that there   is   neither
auricle nor pericardium,—unless                 the membrane which closely invests
it   can be so       called,—that   ithardly more complex in structure than
                                         is
the pulsating vessel         of the T'um'cata; and that in I/ingula, indeed,
it   scarcely at all differs from the heart of these lowly organized mol
lusks. This vesicle, or heart, propels the blood through four arterial
trunks or channels, to the reproductive organs and mantle, and pro
bably also to the alimentary tube, and                  is   apparently assisted by four
or more pulsating vesicles in connexion with these principal trunks.
The blood thus conveyed by the genital or pallial arteries will escape
by the lacunes in the membranes suspending the genitalia, into the
plexus in the <U+FB02>oor of the great pallial sinuses.                       Thence   it   will <U+FB01>nd
its way into the outer lacunary system of the pallial lobes, and into
that of the dorsal and ventral walls of the body, as well as into the

                                        469
lacunes of the anterior parietes.         Having saturated all these parts of
the peripheral system, it will divide itself                             one of
                                                    into_ two currents,

connecting the alimentary tube to the parietes, and will <U+FB02>ow through
their channels into the system of visceral lacunes, which encircle the
alimentary canal within the sheath, and which probably carry blood
to the liver.       This current will also supply blood to the lacunes
nourishing the muscles. The blood thus directed will reach the
branchio-systemic       vein, either by the great (esophageal lacunes, or
through the foramina which penetrate the sides of the channel              as it
runs along the dorsal ridge of the stomach.
     “ The   other blood-current     will set forward   in the direction of the
base of the arms, and some of         it will  pass into these organs through
 their general system of lacunes;           but the principal portion will be
carried by the afferent brachial canal to the extensive plexus of
 lacunes    in those parts, and will circulate, in the manner before
 pointed out, within the walls of the great brachial canal. The blood
 will then     be drawn up one side        of the cirri through the vessels
 the afferent brachial        arteries—originating       in the great brachial
 plexus, and returning down the other, will be poured into the efferent
 brachial canal, and thus reach the lateral efferent sinuses at the root
 of the (esophagus.          Thence    it will enter the great (esophageal
  lacunes, and there meeting with the other current of returning blood
                                                                                 '
  from the visceral lacunes, will      be carried to the heart by the bran-
  chio-systemic vein along the dorsal side of the stomach.
      “ Thus it is
                    perceived that the blood <U+FB01>nds its way back to the cen
  tral organ in a mixed condition.            That which is conveyed by the
  gastro-parietal    and other bands will be imperfectly aerated, having
   only <U+FB02>owed through       the pallial membranes, which must be looked
  upon    as but accessory oxygenating        agents.    The arms undoubtedly
   perform    the office of gills,   and are    true respiratory organs.    The
   blood which circulates through them will consequently be returned
   in a perfectly aerated condition, to be mixed, however, with that in
   a less pure state from the visceral lacunes before it enters the heart.
   This mixed    state  of the blood is not by any means peculiar to       these
   animals, for it obtains in many of even the higher mollusks.”
      The perivisceral cavity and the great pallial sinuses have no com
    munication with the proper blood-vascular system, but are to be com

                                       470
 pared to the atrium of the Ascidianida, and the water-chambers                               of
 the Cephalopoda and_ other mollusca.  The pseudo-hearts enable the
 perivisceral cavity to communicate with the exterior, and convey
 away the genital, and probably the renal products.   On this head
 the author says :-—
     “From the foregoing account of the circulatory                         apparatus,        it
 would appear that the perivisceral chamber, and its various so-called
 vascular rami<U+FB01>cations      in the mantle,       are    not connected with the
 blood-system.      This is no doubt    a startling      fact.   _-I   commenced the
 present investigation fully imbued with the opinion that these parts
 were blood reservoirs and channels, and        I      only relinquished           it   when
it   became no longer tenable.     Step by step the points relied on had
 to be abandoned, until at length the full conviction was arrived at
 thatI    had been seeking to establish      a   fallacy.‘    I   have been unable
 to discover any communication         between    the true blood-system                  and
 the pseudo-vascular              in the mantle or the perivisceral
                        rami<U+FB01>cations
chamber.    Injections were thrown into this chamber, but none of
the <U+FB02>uid found its way into any part of the lacunary system.   The
pallial lobes were removed, and the great pallial sinuses distended to
their fullest capacity, with exactly the same result; and      was not        it
until the tissues were ruptured on applying great pressure, that
a little of the injected matter was extravasated into the peripheral
lacunes.    The perivisceral chamber, then, and all its various rami<U+FB01>
cations, are in no way connected with the true blood-system.”
    The nervous system of the articulated Brachiopoda                  is   described at
length.      Besides the principal submsophageal ganglion, two minute
enlargements are shown to exist upon the anterior part of the (eso
phageal commissurc, and two small pyriform ganglia are described
in connexion with the under part of the principal ganglion.                             The
peripheral    nerves are    minutely   traced     out,     and    two        peduncular
nerves, not hitherto    known    to exist, are         described.           The author
denies the existence of the so-called “ circumpallial
                                                      ” nerves. He has
been unable to detect      the nervous centres in Lingula, and he                   is   in
clined to regard the cords, described as nerves in that genus by Prof.
Owen, as blood-sinuses.
    The author next makes       some   remarks on the structure                    of the
shell, pointing out that in Tereb1'atulina         caput-serpentie            there are
two distinct layers, an external and an internal          ;   and he then draws

                                        4-71
 attention to the important anatomical characters which             separate  the
articulated Brachiopoda as a group from the inarticulate division.
    In conclusion, the author draws a parallel between the Brachio-               l
poda and the Polyzoa, demonstrating           the close structural conformity
between these two groups.
 II. “ On the       Placenta of the Elephant.”        By Professor RICHARD
               OWEN,      F.R.S. &c.      Received April 1857.
                                    (Abstract)
    In   this paper the author gives a description of the foetal mem
branes and placenta of the Indian Elephant. The chorion forms a
transversely oblong        sac about 2 feet 6 inches     in long diameter,    en
compassed at its middle part by         a placenta  of an annular form,    2 feet
6  inches in circumference, from 3 inches to 5 inches in breadth, and
from 1 inch to 2 inches in thickness; in structure resembling that of
the annular or zonular placenta of the Hyrax and Cat. The part of
this placenta which had been detached from the maternal portion
occupied a narrow annular tract near the middle line of the outer
surface.      A thin brown deciduous layer was continued from the
borders of the placenta for a distance varying from 1 to 3 inches
upon the outer surface of the chorion.           Flattened folds of a similar
layer of substance, or false membrane, could be raised from some
parts of the surface of the placenta;          at other parts the substance
formed irregular <U+FB01>brous bands,—the <U+FB01>bres extending in the direction
of the circumference of the placental ring. The outer surface of the
chorion is for the most part smooth and            even shining,   but at each
of   the obtuse extremities of the       sac there was a    villous subcircular
patch, between       2 and 3 inches   in diameter, the villi being short and
graniform,    -};th  of a line in diameter or less.     Thus the chief points
of   attachment      of the chorion to the uterus      are, at the equator    by
the annular placenta, and at each pole of the elongated sac by the
subcircular villous patch.        The umbilical cord was short and rather
<U+FB02>attened: it was formed by two arterial and           one venous trunks,     and
by the slender neck of the allantois, with the connecting cellular
tissue and the covering of amnios: it measured about 6 inches in
                                                                                    E

                                        472
 length, before the division of the vascular trunks, and about 3 inches
 in circumference.        The inner surface of the amnios is roughened by
 brownish    hemispherical granules, from 1 line to -,-lgth of a line in
 size—commonly        about  %  a line; the outer surface is <U+FB01>nely wrinkled,
 but smooth; the amnios is continued from the base of the umbilical
 cord upon the allantois, which is of considerable size, and is so                in;
 terposed between the chorion and amnios as to prevent any part                    of
 the amnios attaining the inner surface of the placenta.                The amnios
 consists of two layers: one is the granular                layer, continued upon
 the inner or foetal surface of the allantois,              and thence upon the
 umbilical cord    ;  the other is the smooth outer layer, continued upon
 the outer or chorional      surface of the allantois, and thence upon the
 inner surface of the chorion.          The allantois divides where the          am
 nios begins to be re<U+FB02>ected upon        it into three sacculi; the disposition
 of  these sacculi is described     in detail.     The chief peculiarity    was the
 presence, upon the inner layer of the allantois, and chie<U+FB02>y upon the
 endochorionic     vessels,   of numerous         <U+FB02>attened     oval or subcircular
 bodies, varying in diameter from an inch to half a line              : their tissue
 was compact, structureless, and of a grey colour.              On dissecting some
 of the   vessels  over which these bodies were placed, the vessel was
 found to pass on the chorionic side of the body without undergoing
 any apparent change, the body being developed from the allantois,
 and from that part which forms the allantoic side of the sheath                   of
the vessel.      These bodies were most numerous near the placenta:
their free surface     was smooth, not     villous like the cotyledons of the
Ruminantia, from which they likewise differed in projecting inwards
towards the cavity of the allantois.            The most important modi<U+FB01>ca
tion of the vascular structures           connecting       the chorion    with the
uterus, in the Elephant, is their combination                 of two forms of the
                       ‘                       ‘
placenta, viz. the       annular’   and the       diffused,’ which have hitherto
been    supposed     to characterize respectively         distinct  groups of the
class Mammalia.
    The author concludes by a comparison of the different known
forms of the placenta, including those of the Pteropua or large fru
givorous Bat, and of the Chimpanzee             ;  and by remarks on the value
of placentary characters in the classi<U+FB01>cation of the Mammalia.

       The LORD WROTTESLEY, President, in the Chair.
The Caoorvrsn Lscrunr: was delivered by James Pacer, Esq.,
    F.R.S., “On the Cause of the Rhythmic Motion of the
          Heart,” as follows :—
  I have selected for the subject of my lecture, the cause of the
rhythmic motion of the heart ; guided to this choice, partly by the
belief that the Croonian lecture must have                   some relation to muscular
motion, and partly by the interest which I have acquired in the
subject in the course of observations extended, though with many
and long interruptions, over                 some ten    or twelve years.
  It is not necessary that                   I   should enter on any consideration            of
the various opinions that have been entertained on the                         cause     of the
heart’s peculiar motion.  Let me <U+FB01>rst show what it                            is,   and how   it
differs from the other motions in the                    same body,   which    are visible to
the naked eye.
     In   a   beheaded tortoise, or any other of the Amphibia, the muscles
of the trunk and limbs              are usually      in perfect rest, unless disturbed:
those in the head may act                    so as to produce   a   kind of gasping and
swallowing movements, at distant and nearly regular intervals (an
imperfect kind of rhythmic motion) the digestive and other mucous
                                                     :
canals are at rest, or move with slow worm-like actions                   ;    but the heart
maintains, with perfect regularity, the rhythmically alternate con
tractions and dilatations of its auricles and ventricle; its several
movements           being ordered, not only in the manner                of their        succes
sion, but in rhythm,               i.   e.   in the proportions       of time which they
severally occupy.
  Why       this di<U+FB01>erence?
               is                            To what may      we refer as the cause           of
this      apparently peculiar mode of muscular                movement?             In   answer,
let me show (for        condition of the Croonian foundation that
                         it   is   a
experiments should be shown) that the cause of the rhythmic action
is in the heart itself; not in any of the great nervous centres through
 which other muscular movements are excited, including those in the

                                              474
                                                                                                      :~:
separated head, which will cease at once on destruction of the medulla
oblongata and brain.
  The evidence of this is in the continued action of the heart after
it is cut out of the body.             It    may remain at rest for a few minutes
after the excision ;' but then, as            if   recovering from shock or fatigue,
it again begins to      act, and thus          will continue for many hours acting
                                                                                                      bl:
as regularly   as   it did when its connexions                    were unbroken.
  The time during which the action of the cut-out heart will be
maintained is different in the several classes of the Vertebrata; but
some such continuance may be observed                            in all, and in all the expe
riment is enough to prove that the rhythmic action does not depend
either    upon distant nervous organs, or upon the blood which na
turally flows through the cavities of the heart                        ;   for   as soon as the
heart is cut out, its cavities are emptied and no blood <U+FB02>ows through
                I
them.
  Thus, then, for       a   <U+FB01>rst conclusion, we may be sure that the cause
of the rhythmic action of the heart is something in the heart itself;
and this, notwithstanding the variations of the rhythm, which may
be produced by morbid or arti<U+FB01>cial                  states       of organs far distant from
the heart.
  But the      cause, whatever         it    be, is not equally in all parts                of the
heart; for when its parts              are    in certain manners separated,                  some
continue to act rhythmically, and others cease to do so.                                    If, for
example, the cut-out           heart     be divided              into two pieces,     one    com
prising    the auricles and the base of the ventricle,                           the other com
prising    the rest of the ventricle,               the former will continue to act
rhythmically, the latter will           cease to do so, and no         rhythmic action
can be, by any means,           excited in it.             The piece of ventricle does
not lose its power of motion, for                  if   it be in any way stimulated, it
contracts even vigorously; but it never contracts without such an
external    stimulus,       and, when stimulated,                  it never contracts more
than once for each stimulus.   Without losing motility, it has lost all
                                        ,
rhythmic power, and all appearance of spontaneous action. We can,
indeed, make it imitate a rhythm by stimulating it at regular inter
vals, such as every two or three seconds                     ;    but in any experiment         of
this kind, it will presently appear how much sooner the motor force
is exhausted by the arti<U+FB01>cially excited actions, than by the apparently
equal actions of the natural rhythm.

                                              4-75
  Other sections of the heart, and experiments of other kinds, would
show that the cause of the rhythmic action of the ventricle, and
probably also of the auricles so long as they are associated with                                    it,
and not with the venous trunks,     something in and near the boun
                                               is
dary-ring between the auricles and ventricle; for what remains con
nected with this ring, or even with                    a   part of   it   in   a   longitudinally
bisected heart, retains its rhythm, and what                        is   disconnected from           it
loses rhythm.
    An   experiment      related by Heidenhain               *,    seems to show more pre
cisely    where the source of the rhythmic action of the ventricle                                   is
seated.       If   the ventricle   of   a    frog’s heart be separated, and every
part    of   the septum of the auricles be removed from its base, so that
its cavity may be perfectly single; and    then,             if,         it   be set      upright on
                                                                           it,
a  board with some blood in its cavity and around                          it       will    be found
that as pieces        are cut away from its upper border, so its pulsations
become less and less frequent,              till   at length, when         a   zone    of   a   certain
depth has          been removed, they cease altogether.         The depth of the
zone to be cut away may be                  nearly one-third of the length of the
ventricle;      and somewhere in this zone we must assume lies that on
which the rhythmic action of the ventricle, when alone or with part
of the auricles, depends.
    But      wherever    may be precisely              the     sources     or centres of the
rhythmic action of the heart, or any of its parts (and most of these
details, think, have yet to be determined, even for the hearts of
         I
Amphibia, and much more for those of other orders), these experi
ments seem enough to prove that the rhythm does not depend on
the properties of the muscular tissue alone or independently.    If                                  it
were so,    would be highly improbable that certain portions of the
             it
heart being separated should lose rhythmic action, and others just
like them, so far as their muscularity   concerned, should retain it.
                                                       is
    This conclusion        is   con<U+FB01>rmed    by many experiments invented by
Professor      Stannius-1-,     and often repeated by myself and others, with
results varying little from those which he obtained.
   Perhaps the most remarkable of them is, that                           if  a   ligature be tied
tightly round the place of con<U+FB02>ux of the great veins entering the

auricles of a frog’s or tortoise’s heart, the rhythmic action imme
diately, or after a few beats, ceases, and is suspended for three or
many more minutes, and then returns in the ventricle alone                                 (I   be
lieve) at a much slower rate than it had before.
   This result is not due to the stoppage of the <U+FB02>ow of blood into
the heart, for    if    the veins be tied separately at a distance from the
auricles, the rhythm continues.                 Neither is it due to the loss or
great diminution        of mere motility; for         if    the heart thus brought to
rest be stimulated,          it   acts once, or rarely more than once, its action
travelling from the part stimulated over all its substance.                         The result
seems    due to an injury done to something beneath or behind the
ligature, from or through which some in<U+FB02>uence would naturally                                   be
conducted from the con<U+FB02>ux of the veins to the auricles, and thence
to the ventricle; for in the other direction,                1'.   e.    in the trunks of the
veins behind the ligature, even to             a   great distance from the auricle,
rhythmic motion still continues, and                is   scarcely,       if    at all, changed.
And by variously placing the ligature,              it   would be found that, where
ever    tied between         the venous sinus        and the             auriculo-ventricular
ring, all the parts behind     would retain, and all those before

  This indication of the experiment (that the loss of rhythm, namely,
depends on injury of something beneath or behind the ligature)                                   is
 con<U+FB01>rmed     by another, whose whole import,                           however,  I   am    quite
 unable to explain.
   If, when   a   heart      is    thus brought    to rest by           a   ligature tied round
 the con<U+FB02>ux of the veins, another ligature be tied round the boundary
 ring of the auricles and ventricle, and including the bulbus arteriosus
 of the frog, or the two aortas of the tortoise, the rhythmic action
 remains suspended in the auricles, but at once begins again in the
 ventricle, or,   if   it   have not wholly ceased there,                is   much accelerated.
 We thus obtain        a    condition of the heart in which the great veins and
 the ventricle act rhythmically, though                  not -with the same rhythm,
                                                               -
 but the auricles between them               are at rest.
    Now, in all        these facts there appears sufficient evidence                   that the
 source of the rhythmic action of the heart                        is    not in the muscular
 structure alone, or in its relation with the blood                      in   the cavities, or in
 the vessels of the heart; for these things are not in any of the expe
 riments more disturbed in one part of the heart than in another.

The nutritive relations of the muscular tissue and the blood                              are   suf
<U+FB01>cient for the maintenance of                    mere motility,       but they are not su<U+FB01>i
cient for the maintenance of rhythmic motion                          ;   they can maintain the
power of acting upon external stimulus, but cannot give spontaneity
of action, or regulate the time or manner of acting.
  It is interesting to observe in these experiments three different
modes of action of the heart: (I) the truly rhythmic, in which the
contractions of its several parts, or of some of them when separated,
ensue spontaneously      e. without evident stimulus or change of ex
                                 (i.
ternal conditions), and                observe    a     de<U+FB01>nite order         and proportion     of
time; (2) such             as may be excited             by   stimulus, which, beginning at
the cavity stimulated (whichever   may be), are effected simultane
                                                   it
ously, or with scarcely appreciable difference of time, by all parts
                      a
of the walls of           that cavity;         then follow, with          a   certain interval, in
the other cavities;            and then are not repeated in the same order, but
give place to the true rhythmic action, which they may for once

when the heart or any of its parts   utterly exhausted, and which

all other points connected with                  it     by   continuity   of muscle.
   Now, of these three                 modes     of action, the last may           be ascribed to
mere motility, such               as the intestines            and the stomach have, and
such     as   is   maintained by the nutritive relations of the muscular sub
stance and the blood in its vessels.                         The   second     may be due to the
same, acting with more energy;                     or   it   may be ascribed, as by Bidder*
and Rosenbergerf, to the action of re<U+FB02>ecting nervous centres in the
ganglia of the heart. But what of the third, the rhythmic, which every
experiment           hows to be essentially different from both of these?
    It   is   explicable,       and all the experiments are consistent, on the
belief (which many before me have entertained) that          depends on.           it
certain nervous centres in the nerve-ganglia of the heart; which cen
tres, by spontaneous discharges of nerve-force, cause the mus"cularstruc
 tures to contract.            These centres (rhythmic centres as they have been
 called) being injured or hindered in their operation, the rhythm ceases,
 though the motor power          not lost; or these centres, being cut
                                          is
 away with certain portions of the heart, the other portions cease to

   Such nervous centres may exist among the numerous ganglia in
the heart, and the indications of their position in the frog’s heart
given by the experiments, agree very well with the dissections by
Bidder and Rosenberger. ~ There is, indeed, nothing in the structure
or aspect of the ganglia presumed to be rhythmic, which can make
us sure that they can act as nervous centres of peculiar force, much
less     (if it were possible) that they must                     act   rhythmically.    But the
assumption of such rhythmic nervous centres is justi<U+FB01>ed, not only by
its su<U+FB02>iciency as an hypothesis, and by its accordance with the ex
istence of ganglia in the appropriate places in hearts, but by the
analogy of the only other example of naturally rhythmic muscular
‘movements in our own or any other mammalian economy,—I mean
the respiratory movements.                         These are certainly determined in their
rhythm by the medulla oblongata.         It is true, they are greatly
in<U+FB02>uenced as to their rate and force, though not as to their very ex
istence, by external conditions, and are amenable in a measure to the
power of the will           ;   and the rate and force of their rhythm are much
more dependent, than are those of the heart’s, on the conditions                                  of
distant parts.            Nevertheless,            essentially and habitually,      the medulla
oblongata is not only the nervous centre, but the rhythmic nervous
centre, of the respiratory movements.                             When    a certain portion    of it
is destroyed, the proper respiratory rhythm ceases, and nothing can
renew      it,   whatever           stimulus        or variety      of external conditions        be
present.   Any of the respiratory muscles may                              be again stimulated
to contraction  some of them will again, and for
                    ;                                                     a   few times, contract
repeatedly and at regular intervals, imitating the old rhythm*                               ;   but
there     is   no longer any combination or timely succession of the move
ments of the many respiratory muscles, as for their proper purpose.
  * Such surviving rhythmic              movements       of the respiratory muscles may, perhaps,
be ascribed to the continuance                of the rhythmic nutrition, of which mention         is
made in    a   later part of the lecture, and which, though not the primary cause of
their rhythmic      action,'must             coexist with   it;   but other than the respiratory
muscles    may thus for         a   time set rhythmically when dying, or after their nerves
are divided.     See especially       the observations      of M. Brown Séquard in his   ‘
                                                                                             Experi
mental     Researches.’         The facts may be very di<U+FB01>ieult to explain, but are not
inconsistent with what          I    offer   as   the explanation   of the rhythmic action of the
heart.

        In   like manner, it may be that the rhythmic                    movements       of the
 lymphatic         hearts in   Amphibia      depend on a part        of the spinal cord        as
 their      nervous centre;       but this is doubtful*;           doubtful      I  mean, not
 whether there          be a nervous centre for the rhythmic               movements,        but
  where it is       seated.    The    case of  the respiratory movements,            however,
  is   clear, and should be reckoned as of great weight in the argument
  for the nervous origin of the heart’s action.
       The experiments on             the   heart’s      action which      I   have     shown,
  have been selected as the simplest and most signi<U+FB01>cant.                           I  pass by
  many more, and say concerning them only this,—that                         I  believe there
  are none whose           results are inconsistent with the belief that                I  have
  expressed as to the cause of the rhythmic action of the heart. There
  are some, of which the results are dii<U+FB01>cult to explain;                      but the diffi
 culties relate to questions of nerve-physiologyf,                  and do not affect the
 simple conclusion that the rhythmic action of the heart in the Verte
  brata depends on the operation of nervous centres in the ganglia on
  or near the substance of the heart              : I   say, in the Vertebrata;          for  as
 yet we know          (I   believe) nothing of the origin of the corresponding
  movements in the Invertebrate, though we may well believe that in
 them, and especially in the lower among them, the rhythmic move
 ments of any pulsating vessel, analogous to                   a heart, are independent
 of any nervous          system.      Such a dilference in the two great groups
 would correspond with similar differences in nearly all other parts of
 their several economies.               The more highly developed the nervous
 system is, the more are its operations in<U+FB02>uential in those of every
 other part       and system;      and, for the heart, we may suppose that the
 making-over of its rules of action to                a   proper nervous system is on
purpose        that it may the more quickly correspond and sympathize

nervous system, it could only sympathize more slowly through the
medium of the blood.
     But, now, it will not have        escaped    you to question,--why      are
these nervous centres rhythmic in their action?               granting  all that
has been said, why is         it that these nervous centres accumulate and
discharge nerve-force, as it would seem, not only spontaneously, but
at time-regulated        intervals?   To put on them, rather than         on the
heart’s muscles, the work of rhythm, is only to put the real di<U+FB02>iculty
of the matter       a step  further back.
     This is very true; and I will add, that they who hold that the
 rhythmic, like the ordinary, action of muscles, cannot ensue without
 stimulus, are in the like predicament, at a step still further back;
 for how, it may        be asked, is the stimulus       (of the heart suppose)
 applied or generated at regular intervals’!            And the di<U+FB02>iculty is not
 in the    case   of the heart alone, but in that of all the rhythmic mus
 cular movements.            For why, it may be asked,        does  the medulla
  oblongata      rhythmically excite the respiratory muscles into action’-.'
  and   if it be answered that it is itself stimulated by venous blood, or by
  impressions on the pneumogastric          and other centripetal nerves, then
  how does the venous blood, or any other substance, thus rhythmically
  and not constantly stimulate?        Constant stimulus, or constant produc
  tion of    an excess  of nervous or muscular force, might produce constant
   muscular     action, whether     continuous    or disorderly,   but could not
   alone maintain a regularly interrupted          action, in which the lengths
   of time of action and of inaction      are  in de<U+FB01>nite proportion.
      This shifting of the question       as  to the cause of rhythmic motion
   suggests that we should enter on a larger inquiry, and take notice           of
   whatever organic processes         are performed     with rhythm;     and this
   seems the more necessary, while we consider that           rhythmic action is
   not tied to any particular structure, whether muscular or nervous,
   nor employed in only one or two purposes, as blood-movement or
   breathing; nor even limited to the animal kingdom: so that, really,
    the peculiarity we have to study is not one of force, or not one of
    force alone, but one of time as an element in the organic processes.
    No explanation of the rhythmic action of the heart, therefore, would
    be su<U+FB01>icient, which did not involve or appear consistent with some
     general law to which we may refer all other rhythmic organic pro

cesses,      that     is,   all such   as are      accomplished         with       time-regulated
alternations, whether of motion or any other change.
   Probably, the simplest example of rhythmic motions yet known
is that detected             by
                     the acute researches of Professor Busk"‘ in the
Volvoa: globator.              At   a certain      period of the development of this
simplest vegetable organism, there appear, in each zoospore, or in
the bands of protoplasm with which the zoospores are connected,
vacuoles, spaces, or cavities, of about                  -<U+FB02>l<U+FB01>th of      an inch in diameter,
which contract with regular rhythm                        at    intervals of from 38 to 41
seconds, quickly contracting               and then more slowly dilating again.
   The observations of Cohn1', published about year later than            a
those of Mr. Busk, but independent of them, discovered similar
phenomena in Gimiumpectorale                      and in C/tlamydomonaa, the vacuoles,
like water-‘vesicles, contracting                 regularly      at   intervals of 40 to 45
seconds.   The contractions and the dilatations occupy equal periods,
as do those of our own heart-ventricles; and in Gonium he has found
this singular fact, that when, as commonly happens, two vacuoles
exist in one cell, their rhythms are alike and exactly alternate, each
contracting once in about 40 seconds, and the contraction of                                 each
occurring at exactly mid-distance between two                         successive     contractions
of the other.
  Here, then, we have examples of perfect, and even of compound,
rhythmic contractions in vegetable organisms, in which we can have
no suspicion of muscular structure, or nervous, or of stimulus (in
any reasonable sense of the term), or, in short, of any one of those
things which we are prone to regard                      as the mainsprings          of rhythmic
action in the heart.
     The     case    of ciliary movements           is   as    simple; the cilia having         a
perfect         rhythm,     so that their alternate and opposite movements are
of de<U+FB01>nitely proportioned                length; and that, where many move on
 the      same      surface, they all keep time precisely, by moving, not all
 simultaneously,            but in time-regulated              succession.         Here,   too, we.
 have no trace of muscular or nervous structure, or of stimulus; yet

generally, any continuity of structure.
      I cite     these two instances—the                 ciliary motion and the contraction
of the vacuoles or vesicles in the minute Algae,—as the simplest
examples of rhythmic movements——simplest   in regard of method, of
structure, of apparent uniformity of circumstances, and of spontaneity.

all    observe       a    rule of time in the manner of their action,                             a      rule in
which there           is   a   regulation not only of the times at which successive
and alternate actions follow one another, but of those during which
each action          is   continuous.
      But there          is    another thing common                       to all rhythmically acting
organs: they are all the                 seats of nutritive processes; and    believe            I

method of manifestation, of                    a   general law of Time as concerned in all

which the acting parts                   are       at certain         periods        raised, with time
regulated progress, to             a   state   of instability of composition, from which
they then decline, and in their decline may change their shape, and
move with           a   de<U+FB01>nite velocity, or (as nervous centres) may discharge

rhythmic changes, whether attended with motion or not, may                                seem
strange, are (1) that they are not continuous, but interrupted, and, as
it were, alternating between action and inaction, or between progress
and regress; and (2) that they are very minutely observant of time.
But, in both‘ these regards, they              are examples  of very general laws
of organic processes;             alternations of action and of rest, or of opposite
actions, being       common         phenomena      of organic life, and all organic
processes being regulated with exact observance of time.
  In    all organic processes, laws of time          are observed as exactly as are
those concerning weight, and size, and composition.

the rules of weight, of shape, of composition, and of time, are all
alike observed in the reproduction of the parent in the offspring.
   And, within this view, we may observe how all the parts, or                            even
all the elemental structures, of any organism, keep time in its develop
ment.        Prematurity      is,   probably, even more rare than          is   preponde
rance, among them.
  And        so to natural    death; for rare       as   it   may be, there     is   a   death
even among men, in which, with uniform                        and synchronous         decay,
all parts arrive at the       same time at the stage           of incapacity for work.
  It    is   the same everywhere.           How evident        is   the observance        of   a
law of time in the organic phenomena of the seasons! or, with more
minute regulation, in those of sleep and waking, not only among
animals, but, much more exactly, in the leaves and <U+FB02>ower                        of plants;
or in their unfoldings or in the movements of stamina, the dehis
                             ;
cence of fruits and the like, whether in succession or coincidently!
In all of  these, occurring as they do precisely when they are neces
sary for the welfare of the individual or the race, we may observe                             a
time-regulation of the organic processes, which, for its precision,
passes calculation.   For though many of these processes may be
very dependent, as to the variations of their rate, upon external con
ditions, and especially upon variations of light and heat, yet their
mean or proper rate          is   not explained by these conditions, nor         is   wholly

                                             484
due to them; a distinct law of periodicity,              various according to_the
species,     is observed in all; and         even what the external conditions do
effect, they effect by their in<U+FB02>uence on processes                     of cell-life, which
they can alter in respect of time in only the same measure, and with
the same limitations,          as they can alter them in respect                of quantity,
or any other character.
   Instances of the time-regulation of                processes in the animal economy
are as evident:        witness the returns of thirst and hunger, the regu
lated times for digestion,            the rates of excretions, the daily risings
and fallings of temperature, the times for the development of ova, for
the growth and development of the uterus, and of all the parts apper
taining to gestation and to lactation.
      Equally is time observed in             processes       of   disease.      It    is most
evident, in one sense, in all intermittent                   and other periodic              a<U+FB01>'ec
tions   ;   but, in another way, as evident in eruptive fevers.                     In   small
pox, for example, not only is the time set in which the complicated
process of eruption will be achieved, but, though every pustule                              is,   in
its appearance, independent of the rest, yet all are together in regard
of time,     because there      is   the same time-regulation          for all.        And     so,
when we watch the progress and the natural remedy of some spread
ing    disease, such     as erysipelas or gangrene, the observance                     of time
is,in the whole process, as exact                 as that‘   of quantity, or any other
characteristic of the disease.
I      dwell the more on these facts, because, familiar                     as they are to
all, their importance        as indicating        a   general law of organic life seems
to be overlooked, and especially their bearing on the explanation of
the rhythmic action of the heart has not been duly considered.                                 For
not only are many of the processes to which                  I   have referred instances
of regular and time-ordered alternations of action, and therefore, in
the strict sense, rhythmical but they are all instances of that exact
                                      ;
observance of minute periods of time, which, on                       a   super<U+FB01>cial view,
appears as the          most    singular     and inexplicable         character          of the
rhythm of       a   heart.     For, in all these         cases, the <U+FB01>nal correctness               of
the result of the organic process, the punctuality                         of its     event,       is
proof that     it   was exactly timed in every stage; that             it     was, through
out, regulated to the second           ;   just   as the action    of the heart        is,   or as
the accuracy of        a   chronomcter,       at   a    year’s end,   is   proof,      or very
nearly proof, that      it   kept right time in every hour and every second

                                           485
of the year.        In             or the development of an ovum, for
                         the maturation
example, or in the ripening of seeds, a law of time, various in diiferent
species, is observed by all, and their punctuality in arriving at the
climax of maturity, after many hours or days or months of progress
ive change, is evidence that they were chronometric in all their
course thitherward.   And where many such processes are concurrent,
though severally independent, as in the contemporary maturation of
all the ovules of an ovary, we may say that their concurrence is like
that of many exact chronometers;                   and their <U+FB01>nal punctuality,       like
that of the chronometers, would prove that, in each unit of time,
each did a certain and proportionate amount of work.
   Inall organic processes, then, there is as minute a regulation of
time as there is of quantity, or shape, or quality of matter. Time
work is not a singular characteristic of quickly rhythmic organs ; it
is a rule   of life; and its rate in each organism is neither determined,
nor beyond certain limits alterable, by external conditions, or by any
appreciable qualities of weight or composition (as are the time-rela
 tions of inorganic masses); but is determined by properties inherited,
 and inherent in the very nature of the organism, and is least alter
 able by external conditions in the highest organisms.
    But though the general law of chronometric nutrition (if                     I   may
 so call   it)   may be evident, yet      it   may be objected by some, that         it   is
 proved only for such nutritive processes as are long-continuous and
 cumulative; and that       an unwarranted assumption to think of
                               it   is                                                    a
 rhythmical or frequently interrupted nutrition.                   To which objection
 the answer may be, that whether we regard                  a    rhythmic nutrition       as
 the        of rhythmic motion or not, we are obliged to hold such
        cause                                                                             a
 method of nutrition as a fact. For we can be nearly certain that in
 the heart, as in other muscular, or any other parts, the successive
 impairments        and renovations       of composition, which constitute the
 process        of nutritive maintenance,          are severally accomplished    during
 the successive periods of action and of repose,                    all exercise being
 attended with impairment of composition, such                     as can be repaired
  onlyiduring repose. Nowlthe only repose of the heart’s muscles,
  and  Isuppose of its nervous system also,     in the brief intervals
                                                            is
  between their successive actions  and in these intervals, and, there
                                               ;
  fore,    with    a     rhythmic nutrition coordinate            with its rhythmical
  action, the heart-structures           must recover from the changes suffered

                                                     486
 in their actions.             Whether, then,            as a cause,         or as a consequence,
  where there is rhythmical action there must be corresponding rhyth
 mical waste and repair; for we cannot reasonably suppose that the
 heart, or any other similarly acting organ, has, as a special preroga
 tive, an exemption from the law of impairment                                  in or by exercise            :
 such an exemption              is,   indeed, inconceivable.
      Now      if   rhythmic nutrition           be thus proved as            a     necessary attend
 ant of rhythmic action,               it    must be regarded as the cause, not the
 consequence, of the action              ;   for in all    cases      nutrition has    precedence        of
 other actions in organized bodies                ;   and the time-regulation of nutrition
 is   a   general and principal fact, and                 is   a   cause, not   a    consequence,        of
 many phenomena which we trace in other organs than the heart,
 and many of which are attended with time-ordered movements.
  I       suspect that, to many, that which will seem most difficult                                    of
 acceptance,         is   the belief that in so quick rhythmic actions as that of
 the mammalian   heart (for example), or that of cilia, there can be                                    a
 corresponding quickness of alternation of the progressive and retro
 gressive changes which essentially constitute nutrition.                                It   must be
 admitted          that, when we watch these movements, they appear, at
 <U+FB01>rst     sight,     very unlike anything                 that     can     result    from     nutritive
changes, in which we are apt to think                            of   a   certain deliberation and
quietness.           But all rhythmic movements                       are not thus      rapid;        and
when we watch the actions of                     a   heart reduced to move only once in
two or three minutes                  (as
                                            a   frog’s may be by ligature               around the
venous sinus), the appearance                    is   like nothing more than                it   is   like
that      of   a   process   of nutritive changes, in which the structures gra
dually reach     climax of instability, and then quickly change.
                       a
Wliatever value then there may he in the appearance of rhythmic                         a
action as an indication               of its    cause,   it    might be adduced on either
side of the inquiry.
  But let          me add, that the nutritive              changes to which          I   here refer,
do not involve the supposition of any rapidly successive making and
unmaking           of the structures of the rhythmic organ, whether the heart
or any other.             We have probably                held too much of the making
and unmaking           of elemental parts as essential to their maintenance
by nutrition.          In the modelling of parts during development and
growth, such complete changes probably occur; but in mere main
tenance of parts there            is   no evidence         of their frequent or ordinary

                                                              487
occurrence,            and to assume it is contrary to the fact, that we rarely
<U+FB01>nd any rudimental structures among the perfect ones.     In the                                                  I   <   a
                                                                                                                          J
most active muscles of the adult, for example, I doubt whether a
rudimental or developing <U+FB01>bre could                                     be   found;    we have su<U+FB02>icient
chemical evidence of                     a constant change                   of material in them, but no
evidence            of an equal or parallel change of structure.                              And   so   in the
blood: the change of material is very rapid, but the change of
structures, which we may in some measure estimate by the propor
tion of white or rudimental                           blood-cells,            is probably     slow*.      And
again,         in the secreting glands, excepting those of the skin and the
breasts,           we have no evidence, and,                        I   think, no su<U+FB01>icient reason to
believe, that in all cases the gland-cell-walls                                  dissolve or burst in the
act   of secretion,             so as to need the entire new formation                        of fresh cells.
For we <U+FB01>nd in most of the active glands no considerable number of
either rudimental or degenerate cells; and the observations of
Ludwig and Rahn on the secretion of saliva indicate, as many other
facts do, that in ordinary secretion (which is the ordinary nutrition
of glands) the cell-contents, gradually transformed, <U+FB02>ow out through
the persistent cell-walls.
  Nutritive maintenance, then, probably requires nothing more than
molecular substitution.  Atoms even of the refuse substance may
be passing             out, and atoms of the renewing substance passing into
places             among the structures                  of   a comparatively              persistent frame
work.              Cell-walls or their analogues may                           be long-lived,    while their
contents             are   undergoing            continual          mutation.         Such a process         of
molecular interchange and                         passage       is,     indeed, visible in the absorp
tion of oil through the epithelial cells and villi of the intestines; and
this    probably only
              is          coarse example of the ordinary manner in
                                         a
which cells change their contents in the nutritive processes. Changes
like these may well consist with the quickest rhythmic action.
I       would thus, then, conclude as to the most probable explanation
of    the rhythmic action of the heart :—
      1   .   In    the Vertebrate         it    is   due to the time-regulated discharges of
  *  The very small quantity of iron, in proportion to the quantities of the other
gonstituents of the blood-cells, found in the excretions,    another indication of    is
the comparatively slow waste of the red blood-cells, and may suggest, besides,
                                                                                                                      J
that in nutritive           maintenance          there   is   not an equal mutation of all the
                                                                                               compo
nent substances            of   a   structure.

                                               488
nerve-force in certain of the ganglia in and near the substance of the
heart, by which             discharges the muscular walls are excited to con
traction.
     2.   In    Invertebrata,     the     corresponding    pulsatile        movements   of
hearts or vessels are probably independent of nerve-force.
     3. The time-regulatedrhythmic action, whether of the nervous
centres or of the independent contractile walls, is due to their nutri
tion being rhythmic, i.      their being, in certain periods, by nutri
                                  e. to
tive changes of composition, raised, with regulated progress, to a
state of instability of composition, in their decline from which they
discharge nerve-force, or change their shape, contracting.
     4. The muscular substance of the heart in the Vertebrata, governed
in    itsrhythmic action by appropriate nervous centres, has a
rhythmic nutrition of its own, corresponding and coordinate with
theirs; the impairments of its structure during action being repaired
in repose.
     5. Rhythmic nutrition is a process in accordance with the general
laws of organic life, very many organic processes being composed                        of
timely-regulated            alternate action and inaction, or alternate opposite
actions,       1'.   e. being rhythmical,      with larger or shorter units of time;
and all organic processes           being chronometric,        i.   e.   ordered according
to laws of time as exact, and only as much in<U+FB02>uenced by external
conditions,           as are those relating       to weight,   size,     shape, and com
position.

    The following communications            were read   :
I. “On       a   new Mode of forming Triethylamine.”                     By A. W.
        HOFMANN,         LL.D., F.R.S.         Received     May 23, 1857.
     Researches on the constitution         of the nitrogenous       organic bases,
which     I zealously     prosecuted     some    years    ago, and the result       of
which were communicated              to the     Royal Society,     have been,      by
circumstances,       interrupted    for   some   time.     Nearly all the observa
tions recorded in my communications               refer to the primary or amido
gen-bases,     z'.e.  the compound        ammonias, in which        1 equivalent    of
 hydrogen is replaced by        an organic molecule.         Of the secondary and
 tertiary   bases     (imidogen- and nitrile-bases), i.e. the ammonias in
 which    2 or 3 equivalents of hydrogen           are replaced, and     of the <U+FB01>xed
 ammonium-bases, little more is known               at present than    their mode of
 formation and their composition.
      On again taking up this subject lately, it appeared of paramount
 importance to search for new and, if possible, simpler methods of
  forming the secondary and tertiary           bases.
      Of  the several experiments          made for this purpose,        on which    I
  intend to report        at another     opportunity,     I  may be allowed       even
  now to quote       a result which appears to       be capable  of  a more general
   application.
      One of the common methods of preparing the amidogen-bases,
   consists in treating cyanic ether with hydrate of potassa, a reaction
   which was <U+FB01>rst observed by Wurtz.             To take a special case, cyahate of
   ethyl, when treated with hydrate of potassa, assimilates 2 equivalents
   of water and splits into ethylamine, which is set free, and carbonic
   acid, which is <U+FB01>xed by the alkali.                An appropriate modi<U+FB01>cation
   of this reaction appeared          to   afford a    means of passing       directly
   from cyanate        of ethyl  to  triethylamine.       For  this   purpose it was
   only necessary to o<U+FB01>'er to the cyanate of ethyl 2 equivalents of oxide
    of ethyl instead of 2 equivalents of water. The action of cyanate
    of ethyl upon ethylic potassa appeared to involve the conditions
    necessary for accomplishing         this result.
       Experiment has fully con<U+FB01>rmed this anticipation.

    ture of pure cyanate of ethyl with pure ethylic potassa or soda (that
    is,absolute alcohol as far as possible, saturated with potassium or
    sodium),     and distilling subsequently upon                      a     sand-bath,      astrongly
    alkaline     liquid containing          alcohol         is    obtained.           Saturated with
_   hydrochloric acid, this liquid furnishes on evaporation to dryness a
    residue from which     considerable quantity of triethylamine
                                 a                                   ex                            is
    pelled on addition of potassa.
          The analogy of the two          processes,        of the formation of ethylamine
    and triethylamine,       is   obvious on glancing at the following equations.
                                                                         E

    clude the possibility of         a   mistake, the hydrochloric solution                        of the

   hydration is assimilated by the products of decomposition, the sub
   stitution of ethylic potassa for the hydrate appears in many cases to
   promise valuable results from this mode             of ethylation.     The facility,
   however, with which ethylic          potassa decomposes at a comparatively
   low temperature, must always be a serious obstacle to an extensive
   use  of this reaction.
   II.  “Contribution          towards     the     History of Thialdine.”           By
         A. W. Horusuu, LL.D., F.R.S. Received May 30, 1857.
      Researches into the behaviour             of several organic     bases   with bi
  sulphide     of carbon, which      I   intend to lay before the Society at a
  later   period,    have led to some           experiments    with thialdine,     the
  results  of which      I may be allowed brie<U+FB02>y to state,             since they are
  but loosely connected with the principal object of the inquiry.
      It appeared of interest to gain some insight into the constitution
  of thialdine,     which is the prototype of an important class of alka
  loids containing sulphur. To what group of bases does this body
 belong? Is it a primary,        a secondary, or a tertiary base’!      The favourite
  method      of questioning bases by means of iodide of methyl pro
  mised to furnish some elucidation of this subject.
      Thialdine, dissolved in iodide of methyl, to which conveniently
 its own bulk of ether has been added, ‘furnishes after twelve hours a
 solid   crystalline     mass,   which may be readily freed from adhering
 thialdine by washing with ether and recrystallizing from alcohol.
     The crystalline compound produced in this manner is the iodide
 of a methylated base, generated, as proved by analysis, by the union
of equal equivalents of the two constituents.

     The deportment of the new iodide resembles that of iodide of

described      some    years ago.      Insoluble in ether, soluble in alcohol,

  unchanged by potassa in the cold, this substance exhibits in general
  all the characters     which distinguish the iodides of the so-called
  ammonium-bases.
     The great mobility of the elements in thialdine, and especially
  the large amount of sulphur which it contains, a<U+FB01>brded but little
  hope of successfully submitting          the new iodide       to the experiment
  with oxide of silver, which is         so characteristic     for the ammonium
  bases.    On adding oxide of silver to the aqueous solution of this
  body, which, as has been remarked               already, possesses    an acid re
  action, iodide of silver is formed, and the liquid assumes at once a
  marked alkaline reaction     ; but since the almost simultaneous formation
  of sulphide of silver, and       a powerful       evolution of aldehyde, suffi
   ciently indicate the perfect destruction of the compound, and since
   experiment denotes the presence of ammonia in the liquid,               it is im
  possible to decide whether        the alkaline reaction observed after de
   composition is due to the liberation of an ephemeral ammonium-base,
   or to its product of decomposition.
      My experiments appear nevertheless to establish that thialdine
   belongs to the tertiary bases,—that it is a nitrile-base.

      To the complex molecule,         C12 H13 S4, we    must ascribe the faculty
   of replacing the    3 equivalents       of hydrogen      in the ammonia.       In
   what manner, however, the elements are grouped in this complex
   molecule, whether we have here to assume a very unstable tribasic
   radical,  or whether    special molecules        are inserted    for each  of the
   hydrogen-equivalents     in the ammonia.      ;—to decide    these points further
_  experiments are required.
      Liebig and Wiihler, in their memoir on thialdine, state that the
   whole of the nitrogen of this base is eliminated in the form of
   ammonia,     if the compound         be   decomposed by nitrate        of silver.
   This deportment      appeared to furnish an easy mode of controlling
   the formula    of methylthialdine; after the decomposition of this body
   by nitrate of silver,  I  expected to <U+FB01>nd’ the whole of the nitrogen            in
   the residuary liquid in the form of methylamine.                  On performing

the experiment,        it   was found that                    the liquid contained considerable
quanti<U+FB01>es   of ammonia, but together with the latter alkali a <U+FB01>xed
base.    This unexpected deportment reminded me of experiments
published     several       years    ago     *, on the action of oxide of silver on
thialdine, which        is said      to be thus converted into Leucine.                                       The
question presented           itself, were the phenomena observed in the pre
sent case   of   an analogous character?                       had the above experiment given
rise to the   formation of methylated Leucine?
  Experiment proved that the decomposition                                           of iodide of methyl
thialdine by oxide    of silver gives rise to the formation of ammonia

     In  conclusion, a remark which refers to a question connected with
 this alleged formation of lencine :—Soon after the statement regard
 ing this subject had been made, Wagner* observed that the action of
 bisulphide of carbon upon amylamine gives rise to the formation
 of   a crystalline   compound.          This compound was not analysed, but
 Wagner suggeted that possibly it might be thialdine,

                         Amylamine                  Thialdine
 and that in case this assumption proved to be correct, the action
 of bisulphide      of carbon upon the homologues of ammonia might

alanine, &c.
    During my experiments                on the   deportment       of bisulphide   of
carbon with organic bases,             I  have also had occasion to study the
compound       of amylamine with bisulphide              of carbon.        It is only
necessary super<U+FB01>cially          to compare this       substance with thialdine,
in order to perceive at          once    that they are two absolutely di<U+FB01>erent
compounds;         and  if there   is still a chance of producing leucine from
amylamine,       it is   because     the action of bisulphide        of carbon   does
not give rise to the formation of thialdine.

    In  a paper read before the           Royal Society,   we have,    Mr. Buckton
and     myself,    directed    attention     to the general occurrence of the
disulpho-acids,      of which only few and scattered examples            were known
at that time.
    M. Louis Zervas has since continued the study of this subject
in my laboratory, and has arrived at the following results.

    Anisic acid, treated with Nordhausen                                    sulphuric acid, at              a tem
perature     of    100°, assimilates the elements                           of     2 equivs.          of sulphuric
acid, and is converted into a crystalline acid, containing

    The formula of this acid, which M. Zervas callssulplianiaic acid,
was controlled         by the analysis of a crystalline lead-salt and a barium
compound,         which were found to contain respectively

    If   the mixture of anisic and fuming                          sulphuric acid                 be submitted
to higher temperatures than that of boiling-water,                                           a lively evolution
of carbonic       acid takes place, containing,                       if    the temperature be main
tained within the proper limits, scarcely a trace of sulphurous                                                acid.
After several hours’ digestion, the solution contains no longer anisic
or sulphanisic acid, but                 a new acid,         which has the composition

    The formula of this acid, which could not                                     be obtained           in a state
<U+FB01>t for analysis, was <U+FB01>xed by the analysis of                                a barium-salt,             which was
found to contain

    This acid may          be considered               as formed             by the association of                1
equivalent of anisol (the product of the action of alkaline earths
upon anisic acid at    high temperature) with

   There can   be no doubt that salicylic acid, so closely allied to anisic
acid, in fact, its homologue, a step lower in the system, must exhibit
a similar deportment.      Mr. Baldwin Duppa has            been occupied    with
this subject in my laboratory, and has already obtained the <U+FB01>rst term,
the sulpho-salicylic acid,

which forms extremely beautiful compounds.
    On submitting salicylic acid to the action of             an excess   of sul
phuric acid, at a temperature of 180°, the same phenomena present
themselves which are noticed in the case of salicylic acid, a powerful
evolution of carbonic acid ensues, and the solution              now contains a
new sulphur-acid,       which is crystalline.       As yet Mr. Duppa has
 not succeeded    in obtaining this acid in       a  state of sufficient purity
for analysis, but it may     be assumed, without         much hesitation, that
it will be found to be
                  Disulphopheuic    acid.  . .

 IV. “ On     the Separation of Iodine, Bromine, and Chlorine, and
        the comparative     degree    of Affinity of these Elements for
        Silver; with some Analyses of their Combinations with
        that Metal occurring in Chili.”               By Fnnnnmc FIELD,
        Esq.    Communicated by Dr. HOFMANN, F.R.S.                    Received
        June 5, 1857.
     Although both bromide and iodide of silver             are decomposed by
 the action of chlorine     at an elevated temperature,          yet chloride of
 silver is completely decomposed by bromide of potassium, and both                 I
 the bromide     and chloride of silver by iodide of potassium.              Even
 the action of hot strong hydrochloric acid has but little in<U+FB02>uence
 upon     the  iodide   of silver;    many       days   of continuous      boiling
  are necessary    for its entire decomposition.          I  believe that   it has

                                         497
 been the opinion       of chemists that chlorine      possesses   an a<U+FB02>inity for
                                                                                    '
  silver superior to all other elementary bodies, and we are told in
  Gmelin’s Handbook that all salts of silver, even the insoluble ones,
 are converted into chloride by solutions of metallic chlorides.             From
  the   following experiments it appears to me that bromine has a
  greater a<U+FB01>inity for silver than chlorine, and iodine a still greater
 at<U+FB01>nity than bromine.
     When a mixed solution of bromide of potassium and chloride of
 sodium is added gradually to a solution of nitrate of silver, not in
 excess, no trace of chloride of silver is precipitated, as long as any
 bromide remains in solution.
     If to a similar  solution, iodide and bromide of potassium and chlo
 ride of sodium      be added, iodide    of silver and nitrate of potassa are
 formed, the bromide of potassium and chloride of sodium remaining
 undecomposed.
     When bromide of potassium is poured upon chloride of silver,               an
 entire decomposition ensues, bromide of silver and chloride                     of
 potassium being produced.
     When iodide of potassium is added to chloride of silver, iodide of
 silver and chloride of potassium are formed; and when iodide of
 potassium is added to bromide of silver, there is            a similar decom
 position, the iodine replacing the bromine.
     When chloride of silver in excess is agitated with            a solution    of
 iodide    of potassium   and  warmed    for  some   hours,  no  trace  of iodine
 can   be  detected  in the  solution  : when   however   chloride  of sodium    is
 poured upon iodide of silver, no decomposition occurs, neither is
 there any action upon bromide of silver with the same salt: and
when bromide of potassium is added to iodide of silver, there                is no
alteration in the union of the elements.
     From    a number    of experiments made in illustration of the pre
ceding statements, I deemed it possible that the separation of chlo
rine, bromine and iodine could be accomplished by this reaction
     The method which       I  have devised is simply this: After weighing
three    ‘equal portions   of the salts to   be analysed, they are pla<U+FB01>ea 5-11
three <U+FB02>asks with ground-glass         stoppers, and about an ounce Of Water
is added to each; nitrate of silver being then added, slightll’ in ex‘
cess, to the three, the stoppers are replaced, and each <U+FB02>ask agitated
violently.      The precipitates subside in       a few minutes,    leaving the

                                             498
supernatant liquid perfectly clear.                  They are then <U+FB01>ltered through
separate funnels, and washed with hot water.                           No. 1 is dried and
weighed.      No. 2 is digested in bromide of potassium, dried and
weighed;     and No. 3 in iodide of potassium, dried and weighed.
   To test the method,        a mixture was made                of   5 grains      of iodide of
potassium, 5 grains of bromide                 of potassium, and 5 grains of chlo
ride of sodium.      The following is a comparison of the theoretical
and experimental results        :

V. “ Note on the Density of Ozone.”                           By Trromas ANDREWS,
        M.D., F.R.S., Vice-President of Queen’s College, Belfast,
        and P. G. Tam‘, M.A., Fellow of St. Peter’s College, Cam
        bridge, and Professor of Mathematics in Queen’s College,
       Belfast.    Received June 17, 1857.
   It  is known that Ozone can only be obtained mixed                            with   a large
excess   of oxygen. In a former communication by one of the authors
of this note, it was shown that in the electrolysis of a mixture of 8
parts of water and     1   of sulphuric acid, the mean quantity of Ozone
does not exceed    '0O4l gramme in a litre of oxygen, or Thth part.
By using    a mixture   of equal volumes of acid and water, the relative
quantity of Ozone may        be doubled ; but even with the Ozone in this

                                      499
more    concentrated   state, the ordinary     methods of determining       the
density of a gas are plainly inapplicable.        The di<U+FB02>iculty of the pro
blem was farther increased by the rapid action of Ozone on mercury,
which rendered    ‘it impossible to collect or measure the gas over that
metal   ; and the tension of aqueous vapour,         as well  as the gradual
destruction of Ozone by water, prevented the        use  of the latter.   After
numerous trials, the method <U+FB01>nally employed             was to measure      the
change    of volume which occurs in exposing         a gaseous    mixture con
taining Ozone to a temperature of 230° C., or upwards.             The volume
of the gas after this treatment was invariably found to have increased ;
and by eliminating the      effects of alteration of temperature and pres
sure during the course of the experiment, by the aid of a similar vessel
to that containing the Ozone, the authors succeeded in estimating the
change of volume which took place, to an extremely small fraction
of the entire amount.
    The vessels employed in diiferent experiments varied in capacity
from 200 CC. to 600 CC., and terminated in tubes of about 2 milli
metres in diameter, bent in a U-form and containing sulphuric acid.
The amount of Ozone was ascertained by passing            a stream   of the gas
through two other      vessels, one placed on each      side of the vessel to
be heated, and afterwards        analysing their contents by the method
described in the communication         already referred to.     It waseasy to
measure with certainty        a change    of pressure amounting to ,—,,_lT,th
of the whole; but on account of the ordinary <U+FB02>uctuations of atmo
 spheric pressure between two consecutive observations of the primary
 and auxiliary vessels, it was rarely possible to work to this degree of
 accuracy.
    The experimental data have not yet        been completely reduced, and
 some slight corrections have yet to be investigated ; but the general
 result of the inquiry, which has been a very protracted one, gives
 on the assumption that Ozone is oxygen in an allotropic condition—
 for its density as compared with that of oxygen, nearly the ratio of
 4 to 1.
    The following approximate formulae were employed in the 1'°d“¢
 tion of the experiments. They are su<U+FB02>iciently exact for the P“1'P°S°
 of calculation on account     of the smallness of the quantities Observed

     Arsenic-,          and Antimony-Bases.”                     By A. W. HOFMANN,
     Ph.D., LL.D., F.R.S.                            Received June 18, 1857.
  The facility with which the phosphorus-bases can be obtained by
the action of zincethyl upon terchloride of phosphorus, has induced
me to study the action            of this agent upon the terchlorides of arsenic
and antimony.            Ihave found that triethylarsine and triethylstibine,
hitherto obtainable only with di<U+FB02>iculty, by submitting                                    the alloys of

                                          501
potassium with arsenic and antimony to the action of iodide of ethyl,
may be procured by this process         as readily and as abundantly as the
phosphorus-bases.
    In attempting      to identify the substances obtained by the new pro
cess   with those prepared by the old       one, by the analysis        of platinum
and gold-salts,     I  have been led to the discovery of a            series of com
pounds of remarkable beauty.
     Since the study of these bodies, and especially of their derivatives,
which are particularly numerous and interesting, will involve con
siderable time,      I  beg leave to submit to the Royal Society, before
the session    closes,   a brief sketch of those substances, the composition
of which I have already established by analysis.
     On adding a solution of bichloride of platinum to an alcoholic
 solution of triethylphosphine, of triethylarsine or triethylstibine as
 long    as the colour    of the platinum solution entirely disappears, the
 liquid deposits after       a few moments    magni<U+FB01>cent        slightly yellow or
  colourless   crystals.     The three salts thus formed may           be considered
  as the chlorides of three compound ammoniums containing platinum
  and ethyl, united respectively with phosphorus, arsenic and antimony.
 They have the following composition :—

  such as contain electro-negative radicals of the othyl family, since we
 may thus expect to obtain a new series of double radicals, amongst
 which the ketones will perhaps <U+FB01>nd a home.                I hope soon to lay the
 results of this extension of the investigation before the Royal Society.
 VIII. “On          a Class    of Dynamical        Problems.”         By ARTHUR
             CAYLEY,     Esq, F.R.S.        Received June 18, 1857.
    There     are a class    of dynamical problems which,           so far as    I   am
 aware, have not been considered in a general manner.                The problems
 referred to (which might be designated as continuous-impact pro
 blems) are those in which the system is continually taking into con
 nexion with itself particles          of in<U+FB01>nitesimal   mass        e.  of  a mass
containing       the increment of time dt as a factor), so as not itself to
undergo any abrupt change of velocity,                     to subject to abrupt
                                                     bit
changes       of velocity the particles       so taken    into connexion.           For
instance, a problem of the sort arises when a portion of a heavy chain
hangs over the edge of a table, the remainder of the chain being
coiled or heaped up close to the edge of the table            ;  the part hanging
over constitutes the moving system, and in each element of time dt,
the system takes into connexion with itself, and sets in motion with
a <U+FB01>nite velocity an in<U+FB01>nitesimal         length ds of the chain      ;  in fact,   if v
be the velocity      of the part which hangs over, then the length vdt is
set   in motion with the <U+FB01>nite velocity v. The general equation of
dynamics applied to the case in hand will be

     In a communication  addressed to the Royal Society some time ago
(Proceedings, vol. viii. No. 19), we endeavoured to delineate the chi!‘
racters     of   a   new a.lc0hol—the           Allylic alcohol, which                  is    the prototype
of   a   new class     of alcohols. We                have since continued these researches
in  order to complete the history of this remarkable compound,
   In submitting to the Royal Society the full account of our expe
riments upon the subject, we beg leave to mention in this abstract
brie<U+FB02>y     some additional              compounds            which           we have examined since
our last   communication.

    Sulphide  of Ally! (Garlic Oil),                       — VVhen iodide of
                                             C12  Hlo S2.
allyl is allowed to fall drop by drop into a concentrated alcoholic
solution of protosulphide of potassium, a very energetic action ensues,
the liquid becomes      very hot, and an abundant           crystalline  deposit
takes place of iodide of potassium.          It  is important   that the iodide
of allyl should only be added gradually to avoid spirting, by which a
part of the product would be lost.            As soon as the action ceases,
the liquid is mixed with a slight excess of sulphide of potassium;
addition of water now separates        a light yellowish limpid oil possess
ing a strong smell of garlic.        When recti<U+FB01>ed, this liquid becomes
colourless, it boils at 140° C., and gives with nitrate of silver a crystal
line precipitate   soluble in a boiling mixture         of alcohol and water,
and separating from this solvent in the form               of beautiful white
needles, absolutely identical with those which the natural essence of
garlic produces. Sulphide of allyl also comports itself with corrosive
sublimate and with bichloride       of platinum       exactly like the natural
garlic oil.
    Ally!-Mercaptan, C6 H6 S2.—When in the process for the prepa
ration of the preceding compound the protosnlphide of potassium is
replaced by the hydrosulphate          of sulphide, of potassium,      a volatile
product is obtained, having a similar but more ethereal odour.              This
 substance acts with energy upon protoxide of mercury, with which it
 forms a compound, dissolving      i.n  boiling alcohol, and separating from
it on cooling in the form of pearly scales of remarkable brilliancy,
 which present the greatest resemblance to the mercaptide of mercury.
 The liquid obtained in the above-mentioned reaction boils at 90°,
 and possesses a composition and an aggregate of properties which
 closely resemble those of the mercaptan of the ethyl-series, being, in
 fact, the allylic mercaptan, C6 H6 S2.

 with a concentrated solution of caustic potassa until the oily layer
 entirely disappears, a complete decomposition ensues, and the residue
 contains only a mixture of carbonate of potassium with an excess of
 the alkaline hydrate   ; the volatile products condensed inhydrochloric
 acid furnish a saline mass which          may be obtained crystalline         on
 evaporation.     This substance is always      a mixture, the constituents of
 which vary both in nature and properties.            The action of potassa on
 it not only separates a base, which is readily soluble in water, but

not succeeded in ascertaining with perfect precision the nature of
this mixture, but we have found that it invariably contains a con
siderable quantity of a base which bears the same relation to allylic
alcohol that is observed between ethylamine and ordinary alcohol.
 The formation of this substance, which we propose to designate
 allylamine, C6 H7 N, is perfectly analogous to the production of
-ethylamine by means of cyanate of ethyl.
    Diallylamine, C12 HnN.—Impure allylamine, obtained by the
action      of   potassa on the cyanate, when digested with a second quan
tity of iodide of allyl is rapidly changed into a mass of hydriodates
of new compounds.       This crystalline mass evidently contains a con
siderable        quantity of the hydriodate                 of diallylamine, but to succeed
in separating it from this very complicated mixture would have re
quired a more considerable quantity of substance than we had at our
disposal.
   Triallylamine, C18 H15 N.—The oxide of tetrallylammonium, to
which we shall presently allude, submitted to the action of heat, is
decomposed, with liberation of a basic oil. The perfect analogy of
the oxide of tetrallylammonium with the corresponding ethyl-com
pound, leaves no doubt respecting the nature of this basic substance.
It  is obviously triallylamine.  When saturated with hydrochloric
acid and mixed with bichloride of platinum, it deposits a yellow plati
num-salt, the analysis of which leads to the formula

 formed into the oxide.           This forms    an alkaline solution,    which pos
sesses   all the properties of the oxide of tetrethylammonium.
    The iodide contains

    On taking a retrospective glance            at the results    obtained in this
 inquiry, it is obvious that propylene,          a homologue      of ole<U+FB01>ant   gas, is
 susceptible of furnishing         a mono-acid     alcohol, which bears to it the
 same relation      that is observed between methyl-alcohol             and marsh
 gas, or between benzoic alcohol and toluol, the analogue                 of marsh
 gas among the derivatives           of the aromatic acids.      The hydrocarbons
 homologous and analogous to marsh-gas, the homologues of ole<U+FB01>ant
 gas, and indeed probably a veryyconsiderable number                of other hydro
 carbons, may be regarded as starting-points                for the production of
 mono-acid       alcohols and of all their derivatives.          All  these alcohols
 are formed      by the <U+FB01>xation of two equivalents of oxygen, which oxi
 dation, however, cannot be effected directly, but is accomplished by
 a series  of substitution-processes.

                                             (Abstract.)
     In   order to determine whether the act of photochemical                           combina
tion necessitates           the production of a certain amount of mechanical
effect,      for which an equivalent                 quantity of light is expended, or
whether this phenomenon is dependent upon a restoration of equili
brium effected without any corresponding equivalent loss of light, we
must now study the phenomena occurring at the bounding                                  surfaces,
and in the interior                of   a medium      exposed to the chemically active
rays.
     If I0   represents the amount of light entering a medium, and                           I     the
amount issuing from the medium, we have aI0==I, when a repre
sents the fraction of the original amount of light which passes through
the medium, on the supposition                      that the light extinguished is,pro
portional      to the original             intensity of the light.        The <U+FB01>rst        series    of
experiments was made with the view of determining this point.                                    The
intensity of the chemical rays proceeding from a constant source                                    of
light     was measured before and after passage through                        a.   cylinder with
plate-glass ends, <U+FB01>lled with dry chlorine.                     The amount of transmitted
light,    I, was determined             for various intensities of incident light, I0, and
the fraction              was found to remain constant, proving that the absorp
                   0]-I
tion of the chemical rays varies directly as the intensity of the light.
From this result, the general law of the extinction of the optical and
chemical rays in transparent media may be deduced.       For, as   has                      it
been shown that the amount                  of light transmitted through      medium  a
of <U+FB01>nite thickness           is   proportional to the intensity of the incident light,
it   may be assumed           that this same relation will hold good for an in<U+FB01>
nitely thin medium.       According to this supposition, the relation be
tween      the transmitted light,  and the thickness of the medium,
                                              I,                                                    is
represented by the equation                 I=I0.l0“"°‘ and 11:          log            in which
I0   represents the light before transmission,                  I,   that after transmission

extinction varies with the density of the absorbing medium.                                        A series
of experiments proved that the amount of chemical rays transmitted
through       a medium varies               proportionally with the density of the                          ab

   We may now proceed to the investigation of the original question
proposed, viz.-in the combination of chlorine and hydrogen effected
by the light,       are the chemical rays expended                          in   a relation proportional
to the quantity of hydrochloric acid formed’!    The <U+FB01>rst point to be
determined, in order to answer this question, is the coef<U+FB01>cient of ex
tinction of pure chlorine for the chemical rays of a coal-gas <U+FB02>ame.
The amount of light                  was     measured before and after transmission
through cylinders <U+FB01>lled with chlorine.                             The loss of light by re<U+FB02>exion

0'76 pressure, through which the light must pass in order to be
reduced to        T15,   is   found to be, as         a        mean of <U+FB01>ve experiments, 1717
mm.          Another      series     of determinations were made with chlorine di
luted with air, in order to prove experimentally that the absorbed
light varies in the                case   of chlorine. directly              as the density.               The
quantity of chlorine contained was                             determined in        each instance     by     a
volumetric analysis.                An      average        of six experiments          gave   a   value for

have     a   value of 1733.
    If   the light       is   not consumed in the act of photochemical change,
the coe<U+FB02>icient just found must remain unaltered when the chlorine
and hydrogen             mixture       is   employed;            if   on the contrary light           is   not
only lost by the optical extinction, but an amount of light vanishes
proportional to the chemical action, experiment must give                                         a   larger
value for the coei<U+FB01>cient.
    In   order to determine this important                              question we employed an
‘apparatus (fully described in the Paper), by means                                       of which         we
could expose         columns           of the sensitive       of various lengths, to
                                                                      gas
a constant source   of light.                  By determining the amount of action
effected    these columns of varying length, we are able to obtain the
             in
value of the coefficient of extinction for the sensitive mixture.                                           A
series of experiments showed that when the light had passed through

                                               519
 234 millimetres of the sensitive mixture of chlorine and hydrogen at                                        '
 0° and 0'76, it was reduced to T1,; of its original intensity. If,                                          k   ,
 instead of hydrogen,             we had diluted      the chlorine with some other
 transparent but chemically inactive gas, the depth to which the rays
 must penetrate in order to be reduced to -1-1;; is according to the ex
 periments with pure chlorine, 346 millimetres.        Hence it is seen
 that for          a given amount       of chemical action   e<U+FB02>'ected              in the mixture of
 chlorine and hydrogen, an equivalent quantity of light is absorbed.
 For we <U+FB01>nd that in the case of the standard chlorine and hydrogen
 mixture, where, together with the optical absorption, a chemical action
 Of the light occurs, the value of the coe<U+FB01>icient of extinction is
  0130427 ; whereas in the chlorine mixture of similar dilution, where
  the chemical action was absent, the coefficient is found to be 000289,
  °1'    Very much smaller.
         It
      appeared of great interest to repeat these experiments with rays
 from other luminous sources. For this purpose we employed the
 di<U+FB01>'use           light of morning       re<U+FB02>ected from the zenith                     of   a   cloudle<U+FB02>s
 sky-          The     experiments gave a value of          of 456 mm. for chlorine
                                                         %
That is, di<U+FB01>'use morning light                was   reduced to    by passing through
45‘6 millimetres of chlorine.  A                    series of experiments made
                                                                                 With
our aPParat11s and the standard mixture
                                         gave a depth of 73'5
                                                              mini‘
metres of chlorine and hydrogen before the light was reduced to
From this it            is seen that morning zenith light is much more easilY
absorbed by chlorine than lamp-light.              Hence it Was conjectured
that the diffuse solar light might differ in its properties in this respoot
with the time of day or year. Experiment fully coll<U+FB01>fmod this 51111‘
Position.           Observations made with evening light proved that 8 d*?Pth
 ‘:'’f
         197       mm. of chlorine was sufficient to reduce the light to 7% of
its original amount, and that 57 '4 mm. of the standard mixture                                       was
required to effect the same end.
         The   conclusion       which    we draw from    all our observations                     is, that
the coefficients of extinction of pure chlorine for chemical rays from
various sources of light are very diiferent.      The depth to which
 such light must penetrate chlorine at 0° and 0'76, in Order to be
  reduced to            of its original intensity, is—

   Hence          it is    seen that the chemical rays re<U+FB02>ected at di<U+FB02>'erent times
and hours            not only possess       quantitative      but also qualitative di<U+FB01>‘er
ences, similar to the various               coloured rays of the visible spectrum.
Had nature endowed us with the power of discriminating the chemi
cal rays, as we do the visible ones, by impressions of varying colour,
we should            see the rosy tints          of morning   pass   in the course of the
day through all the gradations                     of colour until the warm evening
ones at length succeed.
   A    long and continued              series    of observations must       be made         before
we are able to appreciate the in<U+FB02>uence which these qualitative differ
ences       in the chemical            rays exert upon the photochemical                     pheno
mena of vegetation.                 That this in<U+FB02>uence must            be     of the       greatest
importance             is evident from the varying            effects produced             in other
photochemical               processes by differences in the solar light.               We         need
only mention in proof of this assertion, the fact, well known to all
photographers,               that the amount of light, photometrically                 speaking,
gives no measure for the time                      in which     a    given    photochemical
effect is produced,              and that a less intense morning light is always
preferred for the preparation of pictures to a bright evening light.
XI. “ On           the Causes and Phenomena of the Repulsion of Water
        from the Feathers of Water-Fowl and the Leaves of Plants.”
        By GEORGE BUIST, D.C.L. of Bombay, F.R.S.                                     Received
        April 3, 1857.
   Happening to reside in Bombay, in the neighbourhood of a number
of small tanks or ponds abounding with the Lotus or sacred bean
of India, and with four different varieties of Water Lily,                                   I    was
struck with the different               appearances presented by these when im
mersed in water, or when water was sprinkled on them.                                The     leaves
of the lily, like those of the Lotus, <U+FB02>oated with considerable buoy
ancy on the surface, but never, like the Lotus, rose above   on tall                 it,      a
independent stem.                The lily leaf     is   full of holes about the            size   of   a
pin’s head, and serrated at the edges.                        Through       these,    when the
leaf   is   pressed down, the water perforates freely.        The upper surface
of the leaf                smooth and shining, and water runs off  without wet
                                                                             it
       it,         it is                                                 When
ting         as             does off
                                   a piece of glass or greased surface.

         placed under the water at an angle of about 45°, the leaf of the
         lily   seems     to change colour; the dark purple leaf of the red lily                                           i       ,
         appears of   bright rich pink, the dark green or bluish-green of the
                         a                                                                                                 ;
         White, pink, and blue lilies seem to become of       bright emerald                 a
         green; the intensity of these hues varying with the angle at which
         the immersed leaf                is   seen.
              When the Lotus leaf                   is   placed under water             it   re<U+FB02>ects light like       a
        mirror,       so that the image                of any object,      if    presented to      it   at   a   proper
         8-11gle,is     seen by the spectator as distinctly                       as   if   the surface were one
         Of polished metal.                When water           is   thrown on the surface of                 a   <U+FB02>oat
         illg   leaf,   it   <U+FB02>ows o<U+FB01>‘ like             a   pool of quicksilver,             re<U+FB02>ecting light from
        the whole of its lower surface; and this holds good on all occasions.

        1118-11,   which may          be thus translated :-—

              On   examining carefully into the                      cause      of this,     1    found the       Lotus
       leaf covered with              short microscopic papillae, which entangle the Bil‘
       and establish               an air-plate over the whole surface, with which in
       reality the           water never comes                 in contact          at   all.       Another pecu

tached with di<U+FB02>iculty.         The air-plate all over the surface must thus
become continually      renewed and the arrangement kept perfect.
    Sensible respiration is not at all essential to the repelling power of
leaves;   the most beautiful       manifestation of it   I have met with is in
the Pestia, a little <U+FB02>oating         water-plant   abounding    in our shallow
tanks, and resembling        common endive.         When pushed under the
surface,   it looks like   a little  mass   of burning silver. The same ap
pearance is presented on cabbages,           young clover, and a vast variety
of other leaves; it is the         cause  of the bright pearl-lustre of dew.
The same phenomenon is manifested on the wings and backs of divers
when they dash into the water.             In this case it has been ascribed,’
most erroneously as      I believe,   to the presence of grease or oil in the
feathers, and is,   I have no doubt, due to the presence of an air-plate
repelling the water, so that      it never  comes  in contact with the feathers
at all.    The trimming process,          so  carefully  performed    by Water
Fowl, is probably an application of oil or grease,           with the object of
separating or dressing the little <U+FB01>bres of the feathers        so as to produce
an arrangement <U+FB01>tted to entangle the air.               The re<U+FB02>exion of light
from the lower surface of the water is the proof of want of contact.
A  piece of polished     marble or of glass, a waxed, oiled or greased
surface, readily throws off the water without remaining            wetted; but
no re<U+FB02>exion is in this case observable.
   Might not the manufacturers of waterproof cloth or clothes take             a
hint on this point from the economy of nature?                 Could they ma
nage to produce a surface such as would entangle and retain a <U+FB01>lm of
air, no india-rubber       varnish    or other   water-tight   material   would
be required, while     the texture would permit the free transmission
of respiration or moisture from the body, which Mackint0sh’s and
other similar contrivances obstruct.

       In     a note on the action of chloride of methyl upon phosphide of
  calcium,           communicated         more than ten years ago to the Institute of
  France (Comptes Rendus, t. xxi. p. 144,                      ad t. xxv. p. 892),         M. Paul
  Thénard pointed out the existence of a                        series    of bodies which cor
  respond to the compounds of phosphorus with hydrogen, which may,
  in fact, be viewed as phosphoretted hydrogcns, the hydrogen of
  which        -is   replaced by an equivalent quantity             of   methyl.
       It     is   now many years            since   M. Paul Thénard abandoned the
  study of the phosphorus-compounds, for the <U+FB01>rst knowledge of
  which we are indebted to him. The un<U+FB01>nished state in which
  these researches remained, and the rich and abundant harvest collected
 Since   that period, in all the neighbouring <U+FB01>elds of science, necessitated
 a   revision of the subject. The discovery of methylamine, dimethyl
 amine, and trimethylamine,                   and of the corresponding             terms in the

derivatives of phosphoretted         hydrogen.         The time for resuming the
study of the phosphorus-bases had in fact arrived.
    We have    been engaged     for  a considerable time         in the investigation
of this subject, and now beg to offer to the Royal Society in the
following pages a short abstract of our results.
    In the <U+FB01>rst place, we have endeavoured to obtain the bases cor
responding     to phosphoretted        hydrogen,       by    a method analogous to
that followed      by  M. Paul Thénard, simply substituting                   for the
chloride    of methyl    the iodide, and for the phosphide                of calcium
the more energetic phosphide          of sodium.            After many unsuccessful
 experiments,     however,    we were compelled              to abandon    this plan,
 which is quite uncertain, unproductive, and highly dangerous.
    The question then resolved itself into the discovery of a method
 which would yield us the desired substances conveniently, without
 danger, in considerable quantity, and in a state of absolute purity.
     It  appeared that the       action   of terchloride          of phosphorus     on
 zinc-methyl,    zinc-ethyl,   &c., the remarkable substances discovered
 by Dr. Frankland some years ago, would enable us to attain the con
 templated result.      Experiment has fully con<U+FB01>rmed this anticipation.
     The   bases   Me3P and E3 P, the products of this reaction, which
 we   propose    to call respectively      trimethylphosphine           and  triethyl
 phoaphine, remain      united with chloride_of zinc, and a simple di
 lution with    an alkali is all that is necessary to liberate them.

            3ZnCl, E3 P+ 6K0 =3KCl+ 3KO, ZnO+E3 P
     They   are obtained    in this way     as volatile oils,       of a peculiar  and
 strongly marked odour, and possessing distinctly basic properties.
     We limit ourselves in this abstract to giving a synoptical table
 of the several compounds which have been the subject of our re
  searches,  the preparation and properties of which, together with the
  analytical details, are fully given in the complete paper which accom

presence of elements so dissimilar         as nitrogen, phosphorus,      arsenic,
and antimony; they might, moreover, be confounded with potassa
and soda, by which they are scarcely surpassed in alkaline power.
    Only the deportment of the hydrated           oxides, under the in<U+FB02>uence
of heat, distinguishes the derivatives of nitrogen from the corre
sponding terms of the phosphorus-, arsenic-, and antimony-series.
    If    we regard, on the other hand, the compounds belonging to the
ammonia-type, we observe that the electro-positive character of the
substances gradually       rises in intensity     from   the nitrogen-    to the
antimony-compounds.           Thus, trimethylamine and triethylamine are
not capable of uniting with oxygen, chlorine, bromine, and iodine;
a power which the corresponding terms of the phosphorus-, arsenic-,
and antimony-series possess in a high degree.
    Triethylamine unites with the acids producing            compounds of the
ammonium-type,        and containing

     The corresponding compounds in the arsenic- and antimony-series
 do not exist; at all events chemists have not yet succeeded in pre
paring them.       Triethylarsine and triethylstibine combine only directly
with oxygen, chlorine, sulphur, &c., producing             saline bodies which
have the composition respectively,—

     In   the phosphorus-series,   lastly,  the two classes     are represented.

    This cannot surprise us, when we consider the close analogies

  Both phosphorus             and    arsenic              form        well-characterized      polybasic
  a‘-‘ids;the acids of antimony are not yet sufficiently investigated,
  hillthe acids of nitrogen, which are better examined, are all found

         monobasic.     The equivalent numbers, too, of phosphorus,
 Brsenic, and antimony, present a remarkable connexion, the differelloo
 between those‘ of phosphorus                      and arsenic, and those of arsenic and
 antimony being virtually the                  same

XIII.   “ Report of Proceedings of the Astronomical Expedition
      to Teneriife, in 1857.”         By Prof. C.PIAZZI SMYTH. Pre
      sented by G. B. AIRY, Esq., F.R.S., Astronomer Royal.
      Received June 2, 1857.
                                   (Abstract.)
   The Report, presented originally to the Admiralty, at whose ex
pense aud whose orders the Expedition was sent out, consists of ten
parts, with their contents as follows       :—
   Part  1. Astronomical      and Physical observations.
   Part  2.   Mountain    Meteorological Journal.
   Part 3. Reductions of above.
   Part 4. Sea-level Meteorological        Journal.
   Part 5. Reductions of above.
   Part  6. Plans, Sections, and Astronomical         illustrations.
   Parts  7, 8, 9.  Condensed statement of results and conclusions in
Astronomy,     Physics, Meteorology, Geology, Botany, and Navigation.
   Part   10.  Photographs     illustrating the botany and geology of three
different levels in the Island.
   The original instructions of Prof. Piazzi Smyth had been purely
astronomical, and were to ascertain how much telescopic vision could
be improved by eliminating         the lower third of the atmosphere.         In
furtherance    of this view, he erected the Sheepshanks equatorial of
the Edinburgh Observatory on Mount Guajara in Teneriffe at a
height   of 8903    feet,   and found     the space-penetrating      power ex
tended from mag. 10 to mag. 14, and so great an improvement in
de<U+FB01>nition, that a magnifying power of 240 could be used with more
satisfaction on the mountain, than one of 60 in Edinburgh.                 After
a month’s experience       of this station, he   ascended   to a higher one
the Alta Vista—at a height of 10,702 feet on the eastern                slope of
the Peak, and there erected the large equatorial of Cooke, lent for
the occasion by    Mr. Pattinson of Newcastle.         The de<U+FB01>nition    was here
admirable, and the telescope         equal,  if not superior,    to all the test
objects it was turned upon.           A  comparative hypsometrip        estimate
was   not possible;    for although      the observer had spent an equal
number of days to what he employed on the Peak, in trying to as
 certain the capabilities of the instrument at the house of its hospi

  An argument in favour, however, of the increase of height                       was
ascertained through means of radiation instruments, which indicated
almost as much improvement between 10,700 and 8900 feet, as be
tween the latter height and the sea-level.   This unexpected degree
is attributed by the author to the circumstance   the highest station
                                                           _of
being almost clear of certain dry, hazy, or dusty strata of atmo
sphere, which include and overtop the intermediate station, and are,
next to the clouds themselves, the greatest obstacle to good telescopic
vision   of the heavenly bodies.      The results          with regard to the
clouds were equally satisfactory, for    T1,,-tbs   of the whole         were found
to be under the level of 5000 feet.
   The author expresses the most cordial thanks to Sir Charles
Wood, the First Lord of the Admiralty, for his intelligent liberality,
to which the Expedition owed its existence also to Lord Clarendon,

XIV. “Account of             the  Construction      of the   New National       ,
       Standard of Length,           and of its principal Copies.”          By
       G. B. AIRY, Esq., F.R.S., Astronomer Royal.                 Received
       May 2, 1857.
                                  (Abstract.)
   The author premises that the work to which this account relates
was executed almost entirely          by  Mr. Baily and Mr. Sheepshanks.
He then proceeds with the Account, which is divided under nine
Sections.               .
   Section   I. contains   the History of the British and of some Foreign
Standards, and of the methods of using them in Base-measures and
Pendulum-measures,         anterior   to  the legalization  of the Imperial
Standards by the Act of Parliament of 1824; the de<U+FB01>nition of the
Standard of Length by that Act; and the provision for its restora
tion in case of loss.        The <U+FB01>rst record cited is that of the laying
down of the English Standard Yard on the Royal Society’s brass
bar, described     in the Philosophical Transactions,         1742-3   ;  then
allusion   is made to the comparisons by Graham, Maskelyne,               Ray,
Shuckburgh, those of the Base du Systeme Métrique, and those by
Kater (1818 and 1821). The Sections of the Act of Parliament of
1824, which de<U+FB01>ne the British Yard and prescribe the method for
restoring it in case of loss, by reference to the length of the Seconds’
Pendulum,      are cited.
   Section   II. gives some    description of the Comparisons of Standards
made    between the passing of the Act of 1824 and the appointment
of  a Commission      for consideration of Standards after the destruction
of the Imperial Standard in 1834; with remarks suggested by the
advance of collateral theory and experiment in that interval.        Extracts
are   given from Kater’s papers of 1826,           1830, and 1831,  in which
new difficulties    were described and new constructions         planned to
obviate them.       Allusion is  made to the characteristics    of the prin
cipal Base-measures in Britain and on the Continent.               The con
structions of the Ordnance Standard Bars and of the Royal Astro
nomical Society’s Tubular Scale are described, and reference is made
to the accounts of their comparisons.              Bessel’s measure of the
 seconds’   pendulum,      Bessel’s   construction   of the Prussian     3-foot

                                        531
  standard, and Bessel’s and Sabine’s investigation of the atmospheric
 correction   to the vibrations       of the pendulum,      are   noticed.      The
 result of the Astronomer         Royal’s inquiry into the points of support
 of  a bar proper for preventing        extension of its upper surface by its
 <U+FB02>exure is given.      The   state  of the  science of Standards in the year
  1834 is then described as follows.         It  had been shown that it was
 imprudent to trust to points or lines traced on the surface of a bar,
 and therefore, supposing the Standard to be a line-measure, only two
 lines or points ought to be used, sunk to the middle of the bar’s
 thickness.     It had been shown that it was imprudent to lay the bar
 upon   a table or upon <U+FB01>xed supports         of any kind,   and   therefore the
 bar must be stiff enough to bear to be supported upon               a   few points
 at which rollers could be conveniently applied.           It  had been shown
 that the physical reference provided in the Act of Parliament of 1824
 was erroneous in one particular and doubtful in another              ;   and, as it
 seemed   likely that similar uncertainties might       be found     in any other
 physical reference, the conviction was gradually rising that it would
 be better to trust, for restoration, to attested copies of the Standard.
 The question of the propriety of adopting line-measure or end-measure
for the National Standard, which in this country had been practically
decided     (without a single opposing instance as regarded accurate
standards) in favour of line-measure, had again been raised by Bessel’s
adoption of end-measure.
    On 1834, October      16, occurred the <U+FB01>re at the Houses      of Parliament,
in which the Standards        were destroyed.
    Section  III. records   the appointment of the Treasury Commission
of  1838, its proceedings and Report; the appointment of the Treasury
Commission      of  1843, and its proceedings to the death          of Mr. Baily
in 1844.      The Report of the <U+FB01>rst Commission recommended the
                                                                         to physical
adoption of a material Standard, without any reference
                                                                        be made, of
experiment; and recommended that four copies should
which one should be immured in a wall of a public bllild-mg> that the
new Standard should, by means            of bars which had been            c_°mP*1\'B<1
with the old Standard,      be made as     nearly   as possible   equal "1 length
to the old Standard, and that the superintendence             of the construction
should    be   entrusted   to   a  Committee.         These ,~e60mme“datio\\5
were adopted     by the Lords    Commissioners of the T;~e9S‘“y_* and \e¢
to the appointment     of the  second or S u perintending Commlttee, and

                                    532
to the appointment of      Mr. Baily as immediate manager       of the work.
Mr. Baily   made    experiments on the <U+FB01>tness     of different alloys, and
<U+FB01>xed upon a hard bronze or gun-metal as best for the Standards.           He
then repeated some of Kater’s experiments;           made experiments on
the thermometrical expansion of di<U+FB01>'erent metals; compared the
various bars on which the restoration of the Standard must depend;
and proved that the Royal Astronomical         Society’ s tubular scale was
not worthy of entire credit as a means of restoring the length of the
old Standard.       Mr. Baily’ s death     interrupted     these   inquiries.
Generally, however, it appeared that it would be very undesirable to
refer in any degree to Shuckburgh’s      scale (adopted by     Kater   as the
Scienti<U+FB01>c   Standard),    inasmuch as there was no security whatever
that, in retaining documentary or numerical expressions of measure
founded on this scale, we were referring to a consistent system;         that
the old legal Standard was, through a sensible range, indeterminate;
that the new Standard must be <U+FB01>rm in its structure; that <U+FB01>rm com
paring-apparatus    must be used, and that new thermometers must be
 constructed.
   Section  IV.  records the proceedings of the Committee and of         Mr.
 Sheepshanks    (who, after the death of       Mr. Baily, undertook the
construction   of the Standard of Length) to June 1847; the con
struction of new Thermometers;        the erection of the massive Com
paring Apparatus in the cellar of the Royal Astronomical Society at
 Somerset House, with a description of the Apparatus             and of  Mr.
 Sheepshanks’s method of comparing.
   Section  V. describes the proceedings of Mr. Sheepshanks to the
middle of 1850;     the preparations of Thermometers;         the discussion
of the values of the    scales compared  with the old Standard;      the suc
cessive  adoption and rejection of “Brass       2,” “Split-plug     A,” and
“ Bronze 12,”    as Basis for the new Standard; the <U+FB01>nal adoption of
“Bronze 28;”_ experiments on thermometric expansion;                and <U+FB01>rst
suspicion of personal equation.
   Section  VI.  gives an account of the operations of important cha
racter to the end of 1853;      comparisons  of  a small number       of bars
with Bronze   28  ; investigation of personal equation;     investigation of
the effect of inside or outside position of the bar; investigation of
the relative thcrmometric expansion of steel, wrought iron, cast iron,
copper, and brass,    as  compared with bronze;     trial and rejection of

                                       533
Baily’s apparatus.        The whole of this work is of the most elaborate
kind.
   Section   VII.   gives   the results of comparisons of numerous bars,
from    1851    to 1855,     and   describes the    grounds for suspicion     of
change in Bronze 28, and the removal of the suspicion.             Mr. Sheep
shanks’s death occurred at the end of the observations relating to the
suspected change;        and the operations on bars, de<U+FB01>ning the yard by
line-measure, were closed.
    Section  VIII.    gives an account of the formation       of End-measure
Bars, which had        been    begun by    Mr. Sheepshanks, but       was  com
pleted by    Mr. Simms, under the superintendence of the Astronomer
Royal.      The general principle is this.         If  two end-bars have each
a de<U+FB01>ning mark almost equally distant, in the two bars, from the
middle of its length; and if the two bars are placed end to end, the
longer segment of the one touching the shorter segment of the other,
the distance between the two lines can be compared, by microscopes,
 with  a line-standard.        If the contacts be now made ‘by the other
ends, a similar comparison can be made.             If the two results be added
 together, we have a comparison of the sum of the entire lengths of
 the two end-standards with double the length of the line-standard.
 This operation being performed, so as to effect a comparison of the
 three pairs which can be made from three end-standards (the sum of
 each pair being compared with the double line-standard), we have
 three   simple equations from which the lengths of the three end
 standards can be deduced.            The end-bars are constructed, some of
 bronze, some of iron or steel      ; but in all, the ends are of agate, ground
 to the curvature of a large sphere, whose centre is the middle point
 of the bar. The lengths of three bronze end-bars» and of f°“!' iron 01'
 steel end-bars, were determined by this process

       the Fallopian Tube,       in four Cases .of Fallopian-Tube Con
       ception, and on the absence of any trace of Decidua in the
       Cavity of the Uterus in the same Cases.” By ROBERT LEE,
       M.D., F.R.S., Fellow of          the Royal College     of Physicians,
       London.        Received   May 28, 1857.
                                   ( Abstract.)
    The author       observes  that more than two hundred         years have
 elapsed    since  Riolan published      a case of Fallopian-tube  gestation,
 and that numerous cases have since been recorded in which the human
 ovum, after impregnation,       instead of passing into the cavity of the
 uterus, has been arrested in the canal of the tube, and sudden death
 taken place from rupture of its coats and hemorrhage into the sac of
 the peritoneum.        In none of    these  cases has a minute anatomical
 examination been made of the ova thus found in the Fallopian tubes,
 with the view of determining whether they have the same structure
 as ova found within the cavity of the uterus, or expelled from it pre
 maturely in     a healthy condition.
    After referring to cases of Fallopian-tube conception published by
 Drs. Baillie, Denman, and J. Clarke, Mr. Langstalf, M. Breschet,
 and Dr. Elliotson, the author gives the details of four cases, in all of
 which there was no decidua found within the uterus, but the decidua,

                                                                                          .

 consisting of two layers corresponding          with those usually termed
 decidua vera and re<U+FB02>exa, was found in the tube, adhering to its inner
surface and surrounding the placenta and villi of the chorion.                   The
following is the description given by the author of the appearances
observed in the last of these cases       :—“The uterus        was enlarged, and
the whole lining membrane coated with a thick irregular layer of a
substance resembling the <U+FB01>brine of the blood, of a red colour, in the
upper part.     The right Fallopian tube about the middle              was as large
as a walnut, or larger where its coats had burst, and a coagulum                   of
blood was hanging through          the irregular    aperture.        The tube    was
pervious from the corpus <U+FB01>mbriatum to the dilated part. On cufting
open this expanded portion, a small embryo enclosed in the amnion
was observed, and the vesicula umbiliealis, remarkably large, with its
peduncle, came into view.       All the cells of the placenta and villi of the
chorion were seen distended with coagulated blood and surrounded
with   a deciduous membrane, a great part       of which has       been separated
from the inner     surface  of the tube.”

    1. The author remarks, that in giving an account of these experi

which the conductivity        or conducting     power     of    a Substance      with

It   is   here supposed that                   k   is   independent of the temperature of the
substance, and that                 _p   is    equally independent of that of the surface
from which the radiation                           takes place.      It   may also be remarked,
that the quantity of heat which radiates from                                 a   unit of area in     a   unit
of time,      is   measured by the product of p, and the difference of the
temperatures,            t,    and       1-,    of the radiating         surface and surrounding
medium.            It   is    the ratio                    which the conducting bears to the
radiating       power, which                    has more frequently               been      determined in
researches         of this kind; but this would not                           have         su<U+FB02>iced for the
author’s object, which                    has been the determination                  of the values of       /c
for   di<U+FB01>'erent         substances.                The radiating power              (12)   probably varies
for different substances                     as much as the conductive power (is), but                     all
consideration of the former power will be avoided                                    if    we suppose     the
radiating surface of the substance to be covered with                                       a   thin layer of
some given substance                     which shall take the temperature of the upper
surface of the substance itself, and from which                                     the radiation shall
always take place, whatever he the nature of the substance                         experi

radiated from the upper mercury.                         Precautions were also taken to
prevent   the lateral transference of heat through                                   the sides of the

might aifect the results of the experiments. When the temperature

completed, and the substitution of this stationary value of                                           t2,   together

     3. This effect was not appreciable for a pressure of                            7 500   lbs. per
 square inch in such substances                 as bees’-wax and spermaceti.                     Nor
 was    there   any sensible        effect     with     chalk       between       a    pressure    of
 4300 lbs. and 7500 lbs. per square inch.
    Clay which when incompressed had a conducting power='26, had
 when compressed with 7500 lbs. per inch, a power =-33; and the
 conducting power of a mixture of sand and clay in equal quantities
 rose from '36 to '378 by an increase                    of pressure from 4300 lbs. to
 7500 lbs. per inch.
    Generally the effect          of pressure         is much less than might                   have
been anticipated.
                              Efect      _Qf  Discontinuity.
    4. When the conducting                mass      consists of a number of strata
superimposed on each other, the mathematical problem presented to
us requires a distinct investigation, which is here given under a very
general form, together with the experiments necessary to determine
the effect of this kind of discontinuity.                   The result         is that     if a mass
of  sandstone    consisted of a number of strata, the conducting powers
of which should        be about ‘5, the mean conductivity                          of the whole
would not be diminished by more than about                       §1—oth   part, supposing the
average thickness of strata to be                 1  foot; or by about %th, if that
average thickness should be 6              inches.        This effect is much less than
might possibly have been anticipated.
                                 E<U+FB02>ect qf Moisture.
   5. This effect was very considerable in those rocks which are great
absorbents of water. The maximum e<U+FB01>'ect appears to be produced

                                         539
  by a quantity of moisture which falls considerably short of producing
 complete saturation.          The conducting power of a piece of dried
 chalk was     ='l9,    but became    ='30 when the substance             was     very
 moist.     That of   a well-dried   piece of  new   red sandstone was        ='25,
 but became as much as '60 when saturated.               Both these substances
 absorbed a large quantity of water.           Ancaster oolites absorbed con
 siderably less, and their conductivity was alfected in a smaller degree.
 For    a block   of dry clay the conductive power         was '23, and became
 737 when well moistened.            Close   indnrated    sandstone, palaeozoic
 rocks of close texture, and igneous rocks are bad absorbents, and are
 very little a<U+FB01>'ected in their conductive powers by moisture.
 Comparison      of Deductions from Theories of Terrestrial Temperature
                        with the Results of Observation.
     6.  It has long  been established by mathematical investigation, that
 if  a large globe like the      Earth  be heated   in any manner and in any
 degree, its temperature at points not too remote from its surface, and
after a su<U+FB01>icient lapse of time, will necessarily become            such that the
increase of temperature in descending along a vertical line will be
proportional to the increase of depth.           In this enunciation, however,
it is assumed that the conductive power throughout               the mass, or at
least throughout       its more external portion, is uniform.         The differ
ence     of conductive power      between   the unstrati<U+FB01>ed     and sedimentary
portion of the earth's crust, or that       between    one sedimentary       portion
and another, has not hitherto been taken into account*.                The author
has investigated the problem assuming the crust of the globe to consist
of any number of strata of different conductive powers and bounded
by parallel surfaces, the problem being much simpli<U+FB01>ed by consider
ing their surfaces as plane instead of spherical.           Then, assuming the
                                                                     to the trans
temperature of the crust of the globe to be due entirely
ference of heat from its central portions to its surface,               it is showll

arbitrary    and, as the author         conceives,  entirely inadmissible    hypo
theses into the problem.
    For the purpose of testing this theory in its application to our
own globe, four or <U+FB01>ve cases of Artesian wells and vertical shafts are
especially referred to, in which          the temperature has been carefully
observed at greater depths than at any other places in Western
Europe,     or probably in any other part of the globe*.                 The  cases
spoken of are the following         z—
    (1) An Artesian well near Geueva.—Depth=225 metres; increase
of depth for 1° (F.)=55 feet.
    (2)   Au Artesian well      at Mondorff in the Grand Duchy of Luxem
bourg.-—Depth=730 metres; increase of depth for 1° (F.)=57 feet.
     (3) An Artesian well at New-Saltzwerk in Westphalia.—Depth
 =644'5 metres; increase of depth for 1° (F.)=54 feet.
     (4) The Puis de Grenelle at Paris.-Depth=546 metres; increase
 of depth for     1°          60 feet.
     (5)  A  coal shaft at Ducken<U+FB01>eld, near        Manchester.—Depth= 1400
 feet ; increase     of depth for    1°  (F.)=65    feet.
     (6) Ac-oal shaft at Monkwearmouth.-—Depth                 about 1700 or 1800
 feet; increase of depth for 1°               about=60 feet.
    The general rate of increase of temperature in our own deeper
 coal-mines is that of about 1°                 for 60 feet in depth; and the
 same result has been obtained for many parts of the chalk in North
 ern France.
    These cases present a remarkable approximation                   to uniformity,
 whereas the conductive powers of the strata which have been pene
 trated are very different.        Cases    (4) and (5) present the best means
 of comparison.         The Puis de Grenelle passes through nearly 500
 metres of chalk, the conducting power of which                 is estimated by the
 author at somewhat more              than '25, while       the mean     conducting
 power of the rocks through which                the coal shaft at Ducken<U+FB01>eld
 passes, is estimated, by means           of experiments performed on speci
 mens    of these rocks, at    rather more than '5.         This is about twice as
 much as in the former case, whereas the depths corresponding to the
 same increase of temperature are only as 65 to 60, instead of being
 in the ratio of about 65 to 35, as they ought to be according to the
    * In  a great  majority of instances observations    of this kind have not been
 made with su<U+FB01>icient    care to be relied on.

                                      541
theory here considered.       In all the other cases the conductive powers
of the   masses penetrated are doubtless greater than that        of the chalk
at Paris, though, for the most part, they present a more rapid increase
of temperature in descending, instead of       a less  rapid increase (as this
theory would prescribe) than the Puis de Grenelle.
    Within the region comprising         the cases above cited, there are
many local variations as to the rate of increase of terrestrial tempe
rature in descending below the earth’s surface. The authorconceives
that    these  phenomena cannot be accounted          for according     to this
theory without the introduction of arbitrary hypotheses.
    Upon the whole, he believes that in the present state of our
knowledge of terrestrial temperature, it is impossible to account for
its phenomena by regarding them         as the consequence     simply of heat,
not generated in, but transmitted         through    the crust of the globe
from    some deep-seated    central source.
    The discrepancy     between   the actual terrestrial temperatures and
 those which would be assigned by the theory here discussed, may be
illustrated    perhaps by placing the subject in a rather different point
of view.      It is assumed  in the theoretical investigation, that the iso
thermal surfaces      at depths su<U+FB01>iciently great (as 50 or 100 miles for
 example)     are  approximately    concentric  with the earth’s       external
 surface, or, speaking with reference      to areas not too large, parallel
 to that surface, in which case it is proved that the isothermal sur
faces at comparatively small depths (not much exceeding that of the
 sedimentary beds) cannot be parallel to the external surface.              For
 example, the depth of an isothermal surface of given temperature,
 which should be some 3000 feet at the Puis de Grenelle, ought to be
 nearly 6000 feet at the coal shaft at Ducken<U+FB01>eld ; and at Other places
 it ought to be very nearly proportional to the conductive P°We1' of
 the terrestrial mass lying above it.     But the Qbservations above cited
 demonstrate that, independently of local irregularities» Such an is0'
 thermal surface is nearly at equal depths throughout the whole region
 of Western Europe.
    No theory of terrestrial temperature, then, can meet the 1'9quir6'
 ments of observation which does not account for is°tl““'mml surfaces
 approximately parallel (with local variations) to the earth“ Qxtemal
 surface at comparatively small depths beneath it-                 Moreflver, it is
 easily shown that the quantity  of heat transmitted frat“ such *1 Burfac<U+FB02>
to the external surface, must  be proportional to the ¢On‘1\1¢tive powef
                                                                21x2

                                          542
of the superincumbent           mass    through which the transmission takes
place   (in the previous        case   the quantity of transmitted heat is
independent of that power).              Consequently, whatever may be the
cause supplying the heat at depths not much exceeding the general
aggregate depth of the sedimentary beds, it must furnish a quantity
of heat proportional to the vertical <U+FB02>ow of heat, i.           e. a  quantity pro
portional    to the conductive          power of the superincumbent           mass.
Thus the energy of the producing cause must have distinct relations
to super<U+FB01>cial conditions.          Must not, then, the cause itself be at least
partly  su_per_'/icial, and not entirely central    ?   The author    is convinced
that such must be the case.            He   does not profess,   in this paper, to
carry his speculations further.
    It should be remarked that the argument derived from the above
investigations is not directly against the theory of a primitive heat,
but only against the manifestation of the remains of such heat as the
sole cause    of existing terrestrial temperatures in the super<U+FB01>cial crust
of the globe,      at depths beyond the sensible effect of the direct solar
heat.     Whatever      may be the weight of the argument in favour              of
the earth’s original        <U+FB02>uidity (and therefore of its primitive heat),
founded on the oblateness of its form, for example, the cogency of
such argument remains unaltered.              At the   same time, all the colla
teral arguments in favour of primitive           heat, founded on the existing
temperature of the earth’s crust, or the climatal changes which are
believed    to    have    taken place      on its   surface, are    deprived, the
author conceives,        of nearly all their weight.       Moreover,     admitting
only a part of the existing terrestrial heat to be due to super<U+FB01>cial
causes, the <U+FB02>ow of heat from the earth’s central portions must be less
by that amount than           if the whole <U+FB02>ow were due to central heat.
Consequently        the rate  of  increase   of terrestrial temperature     due to
tlie<U+FB02>ow of central heat must            be proportionally   diminished, and the
depth at which we should arrive at the temperature of fusion pro
portionally    increased.      The conclusion, therefore, that the earth’s
solid crust is as thin as some geologists have supposed it to be, as
well as all theories based         on that conclusion—whether           of volcanic
action, or of elevation and depression of the earth’s surface—must
be deprived     of nearly all their force.
   The remainder of this paper contains details of experiments, and
decriptions of the apparatus used in making them.

    Early in the year        1855      I  had the honour to transmit to the Royal
 Society   a. paper on the distribution             of the perihelia and ascending
 nodes of the then discovered planets, which was read at the meeting
 of the Society held on the 8th of March in that year. In that
paper   I called     attention to my <U+FB01>rst notice of the phenomena in the
 Preface to my little work on Cometic Orbits.
   Ten asteroids having           been since added to the number,           I  requested
my first assistant,       Mr. Graham, to include them in             a new  distribution
of the perihelia       and nodes, and he has         just reported to   me the results.
Instead, however, of following                precisely the same semicircles which
 I adopted, he referred in the <U+FB01>rst instance to the larger planets, with
 a view to ascertain whether or not in the small planets there were                           _ ,
 an apparent preference           for the heliocentric semicircles in which the
perihelia and nodes of the majority of the larger planets are found.

    In the  case  of the perihelia no other two semicircles give a greater
disproportion     between the numbers.                 The semicircle 355° to 175°
contains 37 of the nodes, the opposite one 13.
    But in addition to this development of my original plan regarding
the heliocentric longitudes of the perihelia and nodes, Mr. Graham
has found a remarkable coincidence between                      the foregoing numbers
and the periods of the discovery of the small planets.                              It appears
that 28 have been detected between the vernal and autumnal equi
noxes, and only       15   in the other half-year.                    ,
     He  states  that this circumstance, which                 at a <U+FB01>rst      glance might
seem to throw some light upon the facts, proves, after a moment’s
consideration, the exact opposite to what might have been expected,
 at least  in its bearing on the perihelia, for

     “If,  then,” Mr. Graham          adds,      “there      be any connexion between
 these results,   it is not   easy to imagine why discoveries should be more
 frequent near the descending node             ;  and it is quite contradictory that
 there should be a greater facility of <U+FB01>nding                   the planets in the more
 remote parts of their          orbits.”        Upon       these   facts    I   abstain from
 making      any comment,        excepting        that the        present data tend to
 strengthen the conviction that some physical cause, as yet unapplied
 to these phenomena, may be in operation.                       Appended to this paper
are two diagrams, bringing before the eye more clearly than numbers,

                                                                                   '
 demonstrate,    that from the youngest to the most perfect form, the
changes    are the result     of no sudden transformation,      but produced
by a gradual series of alterations contemporary with every succeeding
moult; that the Zara is connected with the Megalopa, and the
latter with the adult by many intermediate gradations, each in itself
scarcely appreciable, and         progressively  approximating     nearer and
nearer the more perfect stages.
    The author    asserts that the development is earliest and most com
plete anteriorly    ; that when <U+FB01>rst born, the seventh or posterior segment
of the   head, one     or more of the posterior segments of the pereion
(thorax), and the penultimate of the pleon (abdomen) are wanting
in the brachyurous Decapods; but that this general law loses some
what of its force in the descending scale of development; and as it
becomes     less persistent, the animal approximates        in the larval con
dition nearer      to   the form of the adult type; while        on the other
hand, the same appears to be a constant law of the depreciation in
adult forms,    as exhibited     in the more or   less aberrant   Amphipoda,
such as Cyrtophium, Dulicltia, &c.          The author likewise shows that
the appendages,       which act the principal parts in the larvae, become
the secondary parts of the same organs in the perfect animal.                For
instance, the lower antenna is represented in the larva by the com
plementary appendage of the adult form; the true antenna is de
veloped     from the base of the embryonic          organ, which represents
the squamiform and spinous appendages, more 01' 1°55 °°"st*mt in
the mucrourous Decapods, but lost in the short-tailed genera, and
the organ itself is gradually increased with every successive moult

 XIX.       “ On the Electro-dynamic Qualities of lVIctals':—E<U+FB01>'ects
          of Magnetization on the Electric Conductivity of Nickel
          and   of Iron.”       By Professor W. THOMSON, F.R.S. Received
          June 18, 1857.
      I  have already communicated              to the   Royal Society    a description
  of experiments by which             I found that iron, when subjected to mag
  netic force, acquires an increase of resistance to the conduction of
  electricity along, and a diminution             of resistance to the conduction of
  electricity across, the lines of magnetization*.              By experiments more
  recently made,         I   have   ascertained that the electric conductivity of
  nickel is similarly in<U+FB02>uenced by magnetism, but to a greater degree,
  and with      a  curious difference from iron in the relative magnitudes of
  the transverse and longitudinal             effects.
       In   these   experiments the effect of transverse magnetization was
  <U+FB01>rst tested on       a   little rectangular piece of nickel 1'2 inch long, '52
   of an inch broad, and '12 thick, being the “keeper” of the nickel
   horse-shoe (§ 143) belonging to the Industrial Museum of Edin
   burgh, and put at my disposal for experimental purposes through
   the kindness of Dr. George \Vilson.                 Exactly the method described
   in §    175   of my previous communication             referred to above, was fol
   lowed, and the result, readily found on the <U+FB01>rst trial, was as stated.
        The   effect  of longitudinal      magnetization on nickel was <U+FB01>rst found
   with     some difficulty,      by an arrangement with the horse-shoe itself,
   and magnetizing helix            (§ 143), the former furnished with           suitable
   electrodes for a powerful             current    through   itself,  and the system
   treated in all respects          (including cooling by streams of cold          water)
   as   described in §      156, for a corresponding experiment on iron.               The

  result,      determined by but            a    very slight indication,             was,        as stated    ‘I’
  above, that longitudinal             magnetization augmented the resistance.
        The magnetization of the small                  piece   of metal     between             the poles
  of the Ruhmkor<U+FB02>’                electro-magnet being obviously                 much more in
  tense than that of the larger piece under the in<U+FB02>uence merely of the
  smaller        helix,   I    recurred      to the plan of experiment                      (§   175) by
  which the          eifect   of transverse magnetization on the little rectangular
   piece of nickel was <U+FB01>rst tested, and               I     had an equal and similar piece
   of iron, and another of              brass, all prepared to be tested,                    as well as
   the nickel, with either longitudinal or transverse magnetic force.
     To each of the little rectangles of metal to be tested,    thin slip                   a
   of copper (instead of lead, as in the experiment of       I75), of the            §
  same breadth ('52 of an inch), to                        serve as   a   reference conductor,
      was soldered longitudinally,           and to the other end of the metal tested,
      a piece of copper to serve as an electrode, for the principal current,
      was soldered.           The   ends    of   a   testing conductor,          6   feet    of No.     18
      copper wire, were soldered respectively to the last-mentioned end of
      the   tested metal, and to       a    point in the reference-conductor found, so
      that the   resistance       between   it   and the junction of the reference-com
      ductor with the         tested conductor, should be about equal to the re
   sistance in the latter.
        A    single element,        consisting of four large double cells                   of Daniell’s
      (§  63), exposing in all 10 square feet of zinc surface to 17 square
      feet of copper, was used to send the testing current through the con
      ducting system thus composed, by electrodes clamped to the ends of
      the principal conducting channel, just outside the points of attach
      ment    of the testing conductor.
     The electro-magnet was excited by various battery arrangements,
  in di<U+FB02>erent experiments, at best                     by
                                      52 cells of Daniell’s, each ex
   posing 54 square inches of zinc surface to 90 square inches of copper,
 . and arranged in    double battery* equivalent to one battery Of 26

   The nickel     was  <U+FB01>rst placed between the <U+FB01>at poles of the electro
magnet, with its length across the lines of force, and, one galvano
meter electrode being kept soldered to the junction of the nickel and
the copper reference-conductor, the other galvanometer electrode was
applied to the testing conductor         till the point (equipotential with
that point of junction) which        could be touched without          giving any
de<U+FB02>ection of the needle, was found.             A multiplying     branch, 3 feet
                                                                                   '
of No.   18 wire, was then soldered        with its  ends Q-ths   of  an inch on
each side    of this point, and,   as soon as the solderings were cool, the
corresponding      point on this multiplying branch was found.                The
magnetizing current was after that sent in either direction through
the coils of the electro-magnet, and it was found that the moveable
 galvanometer electrode had to be shifted over about          4%   inches on the
multiplying branch towards the           end   of the testing conductor con
nected with the nickel, that is to say,        in such a direction as to indi
 cate a diminished     resistance in the nickel.       When the      same opera
tions were gone through with the nickel placed longitudinally                  be
tween the poles of the electro-magnet, the zero-point on the multi
plying branch       was  shifted about     6  inches in the direction which
indicated an increased resistance in the nickel.
    The  piece   of iron similarly   tested, gave effects   in the    same direc
tion in each case, and the results originally obtained for iron (§§ 146,
 155, 161-177) were thus veri<U+FB01>ed.
    No  effect whatever could be discovered when the piece                of brass
 was similarly   tried.    It is much to be desired that experiments with
highly increased power, and with            a better   kind of galvanometer,
 should be made, to discover whatever very small in<U+FB02>uence is really
produced      by magnetic      force on the comparatively          non-magnetic
metals.
    The shifting of the neutral point onlthe multiplying branch                 re
quired to balance the effect produced by the longitudinal              magnetiza
tion in the iron, was only from        1%
                                           to 2 inches.    Three inches were
required to balance the opposite eff'ect of the transverse magneti
zation.
    Hence, with the same magnetic force, the effect of longitudinal
 magnetization in increasing the resistance, is from three to four times
 as great   in nickel   as  in iron; but the contrary      effect   of transverse
 magnetization is nearly the same in the two metals with the same

 parison, that nickel was found by Faraday to lose its magnetic induc                                               ~!
 tive capacity much more rapidly with elevation of temperature, and
 that it must consequently, as I have shown, experience a greater
 cooling effect with demagnctization* than iron, at the temperature
 of   the metals in the experiment.                      It will       be very important              to test
 the new property for each metal at those higher temperatures at
 which it is very rapidly losing its magnetic property, and to test it
 at atmospheric temperature for cobalt, which,                               as Faraday discovered,
 actually gains magnetic inductive capacity as its temperature is
 raised from ordinary atmospheric temperatures, and which, conse
 quently, must experience a heating                         effect with          demagnetization and
 a. cooling effect with magnetization.
      The actual amount of the              effects         of magnetization on conductivity
 demonstrated            by the experiments which have been described, may
 be estimated with              some   approach to accuracy from the preceding
 data.        Thus the value of         an inch on the                 multiplying branch would
 be the       same as that      of      x   1},   01' 71;    of   an   inch on the portion of the
 main testing conductor between its ends. The whole resistance of
 this   of an inch of the main testing conductor, assisted by the
         -2
 attached multiplying branch of 36 inches,  of course less in the        is
 ratio of 48 to 49, than that of any simple    of an inch of the                     {L
 testing conductor; but in the actual circumstances there will be no
 loss of accuracy in neglecting so small     difference. Hence the     a
 effect of the transverse magnetization of the_nickel was to diminish
 its resistance in the ratio of half the length of the testing conductor
 diminished by            %of an inch, to that of the same increased by the
 same, that   to    is   say, in the ratio of II?% to 1231;, or of 383 to 385.
 Hence        it   appears that the resistance of the nickel, when under the

In   the recent experiments the magnetizing force was (we may infer)
far greater.
   It   is to be remarked that the results now brought forward do not
afford ground for a quantitative comparison between the effects of the
same degree      of magnetism, on the resistance to electric conduction
along and across the lines of magnetization, in either one metal or the
other, in consequence        of the oblong form of the specimens used in
the experiment.       It  is probable that in each metal, but especially in
the nickel of which the speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacity is less than that
of iron, the transverse magnetization              was more intense than the
longitudinal    magnetization,       since    the poles of the electro-magnet
were brought closer for the former than for the latter.
   I hope before long       to be able to make a strict comparison between
the two effects for iron at least,         if ‘not for nickel also; and to <U+FB01>nd
for   each metal something        of the law of variation of the conductivity
with magnetizing forces of different strengths.
XX. “ On the Electric Conductivity of Commercial Copper of
        various kinds.”           By Professor VV. Tnouson, F.R.S.
        Received June 17, 1857.
    In measuring the        resistances    of wires manufactured for subma
rine telegraphs,    I was surprised       to <U+FB01>nd differences between different
specimens so great as most materially to affect their value in the
electrical operations for which they are designed.              It seemed at <U+FB01>rst
that the process of twisting into wire-rope and covering with gutta
percha, to which some of the specimens had been subjected, must be
looked to to <U+FB01>nd the explanation of these differences. After, how
ever,    a careful  examination of copper-wire           strands, some covered,
some uncovered, some varnished with india-rubber, and some oxidized
by ignition in a hot <U+FB02>ame, it was ascertained that none of these circum
stances produced any sensible in<U+FB02>uence on the whole resistance ; and‘
it was found that the wire-rope prepared for the           Atlantic cable (No.14
gauge, composed        of  seven    No. 22 wires, and weighing altogether
from 109 to 125 grains per foot) conducted about as well, on the
average, as solid wire of the same mass: but, in the larger collection

                                                   551
 of specimens           which thus came to be tested, still greater differences in
 conducting power             were discovered than any previously observed.                         It      4 I
 appeared now certain that these differences were owing to different
 qualities of the copper wire itself, and it became important to <U+FB01>nd                                        I

       The strands spun from wire of the                   same manufactories              showed
 nearly the same relative qualities, with the exception of an inversion
 as regards the manufactories       and D, which
                                              B       have been led toI
 believe must have arisen from an accidental change of labels before
 the specimens came into my hands.
    Two other samples chosen at random about ten days later, out of
 large stocks of wire supplied from each of the same four manufactories,
 were tested with different instruments, and exhibited, as nearly as
 could be estimated, the same relative qualities. It seems, therefore,
 that there  some degree of constancy in the quality of wire supplied
                   is
 from the same manufactory, while there      vast superiority in the
                                                              is

to be remarked, that a submarine telegraph constructed with

show how important        it is to shareholders in submarine telegraph
companies that only the best copper wire should be admitted for
their use.    When the importance of the object is recognized, there
can be little difficulty in <U+FB01>nding how the best, or nearly the best,
wire is to be uniformly obtained, seeing that all the specimens of two
of the manufactories which have             as yet been examined have proved
to be of the best, or little short of the best quality, while those                      of
the others have been found inferior in nearly constant proportion.
    What is the    cause   of   these     differences in electrical quality is a
question not only of much practical importance, but of high scienti<U+FB01>c
interest.   If chemical   composition is to be looked to for the explana
tion, very slight deviations from perfect purity must be sufficient to
produce great effects      on the electric conductivity                   of copper;    the
following    being the results of an assay by Messrs. Matthey and
 Johnson,   made    on one of the specimens of copper wire which                           I
 had found to be of low conducting power                   :—

    The whole stock of wire from which the                    samples    experimented on
 were taken, has been        supplied        by the different manufacturers               as
 remarkably pure; and being found satisfactory in mechanical quali
 ties, had never been suspected          to present any want of uniformity                as
 to value  for telegraphic purposes, when                I  <U+FB01>rst discovered the differ
 ence  in conductivity referred to         above.       That      even the worst   of them
 are superior in conducting power to some other qualities                      of commer
 cial copper, although not superior to all ordinary copper wire, appears
 from the following set of comparisons which                  I have had made      between
 specimens of the No. 22        A wire, ordinary copper wire purchased in
 Glasgow,    <U+FB01>ne sheet-copper used in blocks for calico-printers,                       and

problem as        if   air were an incompressible <U+FB02>uid.                 The ordinary hydro
dynamical          equations, so applied, give the velocity and the pressure
of the <U+FB02>uid         at any point       ;     and the variations of density and tempe
rature actually experienced                    by   the air are approximately determined
by using the approximate evaluation of the pressure thus obtained.
Now,     if   a   solid of any shape be carried uniformly through                         a   perfect
                  experiences <U+FB02>uid-pressure at different parts of its surface,

                                       P=1T      +%P    (V“—q’)
where     H   denotes         the <U+FB02>uid-pressure at considerable distances from the
solid,   p    the mass of unity of volume of the <U+FB02>uid,                      V   the velocity        of
translation of the solid, and                  q    the velocity of the <U+FB02>uid relatively to
the solid, at the point of its surface in question.                         The   effect      of this
pressure on the whole is, no resultant force, and only                                a   resultant
couple which            vanishes in certain cases, including                 all in which the
solid    is   symmetrical with reference                  to the direction of motion.               If
the surface of the body be everywhere convex, there will be an aug
mentation         of pressure in the fore and after parts of                    it,   and   a    dimi
nution of pressure round                a    medium zone.        There are clearly in every
such case just two points of the surface of the solid, one in the fore
part, and the other in the after part, at which the velocity of the fluid
relatively to      it   is    zero, and which we may call the fore and after pole
respectively.  The middle region round the body in which the relative
velocity exceeds V, and where consequently the <U+FB02>uid pressure   dimi                         is
nished by the motion, may be called the equatorial zone                           ;   and where
there    is   a   de<U+FB01>nite middle line, or line of maximum relative volocity,
this line will be called the equator.

and perfectly      free from mutual friction among its parts.

     To <U+FB01>nd the      greatest   depression of temperature in any case, it is
 necessary     to take the form of the body into account.                  If this be
 spherical,     the absolute      velocity of the <U+FB02>uid backwards across the
 equator will be half the velocity of the ball forwards;              or the relative
 velocity (q) of the <U+FB02>uid across          the equator will be     %
                                                                     of the velocity
 of the solid.      Hence the depression of temperature at the equator                of
 a sphere moving         slowly    through the air will be just         %
                                                                          of the    ele
vation of temperature at each pole.              It is obvious from this that a
spheroid of revolution, moving in the direction of its axis, would
experience at its equator a depression of temperature, greater                if it  be
 an oblate spheroid,         or less   if it be a prolate spheroid, than         %
                                                                                      of
 the elevation of temperature at each pole.
     It must be borne in mind, that, besides the limitation to velocities
of the body small in comparison with the velocity of sound, these
conclusions involve the supposition that the relative motions of the dif
 ferent parts of the air are unresisted by mutual friction, a supposition
which is not even approximately              true in most cases that can come
under observation.          Even in the case of a ball pendulum vibrating
in air, Professor Stokes * <U+FB01>nds that the motion is seriously in<U+FB02>uenced

sensible on even the most delicate of the -ether thermometers yet
made (330 divisions to a degree), it is not to be expected that any
thing like   a complete veri<U+FB01>cation or even illustration                        of the preceding
theory, involving the assumption of no friction, can be had. It is
probable that the forward polar region of heating effect will, in con
sequence of <U+FB02>uid friction, become gradually larger as the velocity is
increased, until it spreads over the whole equatorial region, and does
away with all cooling effects.

modifying     effects    of resisting        envelopes,     and on the temperatures at
different parts of the surface of                a whirled globe.              The whirling ap
paratus consisted of           a  wheel worked by hand, communicating rapid
rotation   to an axle,        at the extremity         of which          an arm carrying the
thermometer with its bulb outwards was <U+FB01>xed.                            The distance between
the centre of the axle and the thermometer bulb                           was in all the expe
riments 39 inches.            The thermometers             made use         of   were <U+FB01>lled  with
ether or chloroform,             and had, the smaller 275, and the larger 330

   The increased thermal                 effect at comparatively slow velocities, exhi
bited in the above Table, appeared to be owing to the friction                                  of the
air against      the paper surface being greater than against the polished
glass surface.

 that the bared parts were on each side, we found the somewhat

   On inspecting the             above Table,         it will     be seen that the thermal
effect produced at slow velocities was <U+FB01>ve times as great as                                with the
bare bulb.         This increase is evidently due to friction.                            In fact,  as
one layer     of wire    was employed, and the coils were not so close as to
prevent the access of air between them, the surface must have been
about four times as great as that of the uncovered bulb.                                    At high
velocities, it is probable that               a  cushion of air which has not time to
escape past resisting obstacles                 makes the actual friction almost inde
pendent of variations of surface, which leave the magnitude of the
body unaltered.            I11  conformity with this observation, it will be seen
that at high velocities the thermal effect was nearly reduced to the
quantity observed with the uncovered bulb.                             Similar remarks apply
to the following results obtained after wrapping round the bulb                                a  <U+FB01>ne
spiral of thin brass wire.

     It   is   clear from these, that the air, after coming in contact with the

 situations, such for instance as      one or two inches above a wall op
 posite to the wind, the thermometer indicates a higher temperature
 than it does when exposed to the blast.          The question, which is one
 of great interest for meteorological       science, has hitherto   been only
 partially discussed by us, andifor its complete solution will require a
 careful estimate of the temperature of the earth’s surface, of the

 in different winds.

        Alterations    of Temperature         accompanying      Changes      of

        Received June 18, 1857.
    In the further prosecution of the experiments of which             an out
                         ‘
line was   given in the    Proceedings’ for January 29, 1857, the author
has veri<U+FB01>ed the theory of Professor Thomson, as applied to the
thermal e<U+FB01>'ects of laying weights         on and taking    them off metallic
pillars and cylinders of vulcanized india-rubber.            Heat is evolved
by compression,       and absorbed on removing        the compressing force
in  every substance    yet experimented on.       In the case  of metals, the   .
results    agree  very closely with    the formula    in which   e, the  longi
tudinal     expansion by heat under pressure, is considered the same
as the expansion without pressure.          It was observed, however, that
all the experimental results were a little in excess of the theoretical,
and it became       therefore important     to inquire   whether     the force
of elasticity in metals is impaired by heat.           In the <U+FB01>rst arrange
ments for this purpose, the actual expansion of‘ the bars employed
in the experiments was ascertained by a micrometric         apparatus,-lst,
when there was no tensile force, and 2nd, when a weight of 700 lbs.
was hung to the extremity        of the quarter-inch rods. The results,
reliable to less than one-hundredth of their whole value, did not
exhibit any notable e<U+FB02>"ect of tensile force on the coe<U+FB01>ieient of ex
pansion by heat.        An experiment susceptible of greater delicacy

                                                     565

 wound             upon a rod of iron          1     of    an    inch     in diameter.  This was
 heated to redness.                  Then, after plunging               in cold water, the spiral
 was slipped off.              The number of convolutions of the spiral                        was 420,
 and its weight               58    grains.    Its length, when suspended from one
 end, was 6'35   inches, but on adding to the extremity a weight
                                                                     of

 degree Centigrade of descending temperature.  Hence,  as 1\1r. James
 Thomson has shown that the pulling out of a spiral is equivalent
 to twisting          a wire,      it follows that the force of torsion                     in steel   wire
 is      decreased     ‘O00-11      by each degree          of temperature.

      Professor    Thomson      has obligingly furnished               me    with the fol
'
   lowing investigation     :
      On the Alterations      of Temperature accompanying                    Changes  of
                                  Pressure in Fluids.
      Let   a mass   of <U+FB02>uid, given        at a temperature         t and under     a pres
  sure   10,  be subjected to the         following cycle of four operations in
   order.
      (1) The <U+FB02>uid being protected against gain or loss of heat, let
   the pressure on it be increased from p to p+w.
      (2) Let heat be added, and the pressure of the <U+FB02>uid maintained
  constant at 12 +211, till its temperature rises by dt.
             The <U+FB02>uid being again protected against gain or loss of heat,
  let its pressure he reduced from           p+w     to  10.
     (4) Let heat be abstracted, and the                       pressure     maintained   at.
p, till the temperature sinks to t again.                                        -
     At the end of this cycle of operations, the <U+FB02>uid                     is again  in the
  same physical condition as         it  was at the beginning, but, as is shown
 by the following        considerations,        a certain       transformation     of heat
 into work or the reverse has been effected by means of it.
     In  two of these four operations the <U+FB02>uid increases in bulk, and
 in the other two it contracts to              an equal extent.          If  the pressure
  were uniform during them all, there would be neither gain nor loss
  of work; but inasmuch            as the pressure           is greater     by w during
  operation     (2) than during operation (4), and rises during (1) by
  the same amount as it falls during (3), there will, on the whole, be
 an amount of work equal to walv, done by the <U+FB02>uid in expanding,
 over and above that which is spent on it by pressure from without
 while     it is contracting,      if  alv   denote    a   certain     augmentation     of
 volume which,        when    -m‘  and     dt   are  in<U+FB01>nitely small, is in<U+FB01>nitely
 nearly equal to the expansion of the <U+FB02>uid during operation (2), or
 its contraction during operation                     Hence, considering the bulk
 of the <U+FB02>uid primitively operated on               as unity,     if we  take

  In<U+FB01>nitely        small, we have an amount of work equal to

  gained from the            cycle.         The     case         of   a   <U+FB02>uid such                 as water       below
  390'    1   Fal1r.,    which contracts            under constant pressure, with an ele
  vation of temperature, is                  of course included by admitting negative
  values for e, and making                  the corresponding changes in statement.
     Since the <U+FB02>uid is restored to its primitive physical condition at
  the end of the cycle, the source from which the work thus gained
  is drawn, must be beat, and since the operations are each perfectly
  reversible, Carnot’s principle must hold; that is to say, if 0 denote
 the excess of temperature of                       the body while                       taking in heat above

result is a stereoscopic perception,         as when we look       through    the
stereoscope    at two images    of different perspectives.
    It  appears that all    the different images refracted separately by
every part of the lens, are each only visible on the line of their
refraction when it corresponds with the optic axis, so that while we
examine the image on the ground glass, if we move the head we lose
the perception of all the rays which are not corresponding with the
optic axes, and have only the perception of those which, according to
the position of the eyes, gradually happen to coincide with the optic
axes.      Consequently when we look on the ground glass perfectly in
the middle, the two eyes being equally distant from the centre, the
right    eye sees only the rays refracted from the left       of the   lens, and
the left eye only those refracted from the right of the lens.
     If  we move   the head horizontally,      as soon    as we have    deviated
 about 6° from      the centre on the right or on the left, in the <U+FB01>rst
 position the right eye sees no image, and the left eye sees the image
 which before was seen by the right eye; in the second position the
 inverse takes place, and of course in both cases there cannot exist
 any stereoscopic illusion.
     When    we examine on the ground         glass  the image of a solid pro
 duced    by the whole aperture of the lens,      if  we have taken the focus
 on the nearest point of the_solid. we remark, in looking with the two
 eyes, that the image is stereoscopic, and as soon as we shut one eye
 the illusion of relief disappears instantly.
     The stereoscopic effect is beautifully brought out by the image of
 a  group of trees ; and when experimenting in an operating room, it is
 rendered quite conspicuous       if we  take the image of an object having
 several planes very distinct, such as the focimeter,         which the author
 has described in a former memoir (see Phil. Mag. for June 1851).
     If without altering the focus we examine the same image with the
 pseudoscope, the effect is pseudoscopic.           But  if the focus has been
 set on the most distant plane        of the focimeter, the    effect is pseudo-r
 scopic, and it becomes stereoscopic in looking with the pseudoscope.
     The   image loses its relief when it is produced only by the centre of
 the lens.     The stereoscopic and pseudoscopic effects are therefore
 as  much less apparent as the aperture of the lens has been more
 reduced, and they are the more evident          if  the image is produced by
 /two apertures on both extremities        of the horizontal diameter of      the

               decided mlnifestation       of the whole phenomenon.
                But it must be remarked, that the     if           image   is     received on      a   trans
              parent paper
                           instead of ground glass,           it   does not in any case present
              the least mugion of relief. The

yellow and the other blue, forming only one image of              a grey tint,
being the mixture       of yellow and blue, when       we  look with the two
eyes   at an equal    distance from the       centre.    But when shutting
alternately, now the right eye and       then the left eye, in the <U+FB01>rst case
the image appears yellow, and in the second it appears blue.
    If while looking with the two eyes (the opening on the right of
the lens being covered with the yellow glass, and the opening on the
left with the blue glass) we move the head on the right of about 6°,
the mixture of the two colours disappears, and the image retains
only the blue colour     ; on the other hand,    if after having resumed the
middle position, which shows again the mixture of the two colours,
we move the head on the        left of  6°, the mixture     disappears again,
and the image retains only the yellow colour.
    This proves evidently that    each eye sees only the rays which, when
 after having been refracted by any part of the lens, and continuing
their course in a direct line through       the ground glass, coincide with
the optic axes, while all the other rays are invisible.
    The consideration of these singular facts has led the author to
think that it would be possible to construct a new stereoscope, in
which the two      eyes  looking  at a single image could see    it in perfect
relief, such a  single image being composed of two images, of different
perspectives superposed, one visible only to the right eye and the
other to the left.     This would    be easily done by refracting a stereo
 scopic slide on a ground glass,       through   two semi-lenses separated
enough to make the right picture of the slide coincide with the left
picture at the focus of the semi-lenses.            The whole arrangement
may be easily understood;        ‘we have   only to suppose that we look

    The arrangement  of the Spongiadw by Lamarck, based entirely on
 external form, is wholly inadequatefor the discrimination of species.
 The classi<U+FB01>cation            adopted by Drs. Fleming, Grant, and Johnston,
 dependent more especially on the chemical constituents of these
 bodies, is far too limited to be applied in generic characters. The
 author has, therefore, for this purpose rejected both systems, and has
 retained the latter one for forming primary divisions only, and he

            .         Cellular tissues.

  And, in the                    second   place, to treat of the organization and physio
logy in the following order :—
   1. The skeleton.
   2. The sarcodous system.
            .         The interstitial canals.
                      The intermarginal cavities.

                       And to conclude with observations on the generic characters.
   The author then proceeds to describe the spicula, which he states
are essentially different in character from the <U+FB01>bres of the sponge;
although the latter may be equally siliceous with the former. How
ever closely the spicula                   maybe brought into contact with     each other,
or with siliceous <U+FB01>bre, they appear never to unite or anastomose;
while the <U+FB01>bre, whether                      siliceous or keratose, always anastomoses
when it comes in contact with other parts of its own body or with
those of its own species.                        A   detailed description   is given of the
origin and progressive development of                       these   organs, from which    it
is inferred that they are the homologues of the bones in the higher
classes                 of animals, and that the forms they      assume are always   of   an
organic type, never crystalline                      or angular; and the same forms of
spicula                  are   found composed of either silex or carbonate of lime,

                                             575
     demonstrating       the fact that the deposits of earthy matter are in
    <U+FB02>ufmced by the laws of animal organization only, and never oy those
    of   ‘norgallic or crystalline arrangement.
      _
        Each Species of sponge has, not one form of spiculum only, equally
    dmpersetl throughout its          whole substance;      but, on the contrary,
    sePa1'Bte     parts  have their appropriate     forms; and thus    we <U+FB01>nd   that
    there are often three, four,         or even more forms of spicula in the
    same      individual.    The author      therefore, in describing them, pro
    POSes to treat of these organs in        the following order   :—
        I - spicula of the skeleton.
        2- Connecting spicula.
        3- Defensive spicula.
        4- spicula of the      membranes.
        5- spicula of the      sarcode.
        6-   spicula of   the gemmules.
        151;.   The   spicula of the skeleton in the siliceous sponges           are
   usually simple, elongate in form, slightly curved, and are occasion
   ally more or less furnished with spines. They are either irregularly
   matted together, collected in fasciculi, or dispersed within or upon
   the keratose <U+FB01>bres of which the skeleton is to a great extent com
   P°$ed-        All  these elongate forms of spicula      are subject  to extreme
   Variety      of length. In some species they maintain a great degree of
   uniformity, while in others they vary to a very considerable extent,
   according to the       necessities
                           7           arising from the mode of the construction
  Of the skeleton.
       2nd. The connecting spicula are not necessarily a part of the
  Skeleton; they are a subsidiary portion of it under especial circum
  stances, in a few genera
                                    only, as Geodia, Pachymatiama, and other
  59011895      Whi¢h   have a thick crustaeeous surface, which the spicula
   serve to suPP°1't and retain in due connexion with the 1119-59 Of the
   rmixnal beneath.        The normal form of these spicula is very different
  from that of the general                                  skeleton, and they are
                                    mass of those of the
   much    more complex        and varied in their structure. They usually     have
  a long,     stout,    cylindrical    or attenuating shaft terminating either
  acutely   01'                                                     is         into
                 hemispherically      at the base, while the apex      diyided
 three    equi“an8'~l1&r      radii which assume       in di<U+FB01>erent 5Pe°1°s “ °°n‘
 siderable   amount of         varéty as regards form and direction.
                                                                           The tri
radiate   apices      are usually                      to the inner surface of the
                                     cemented <U+FB01>rmly

                                           576
   crustular coat of the sponge;         while the            and elongated shaft is
                                                      stout
   intermingled with, and <U+FB01>rmly cemented by, keratode to the general
                                                    ‘
   mass    of the skeleton.
‘
       3rd. The defensive       spicula are divisible into two classes: those
   of   the exterior, and those of the interior of the sponge.              They   are
   neither of them necessarily present in every species,               nor are they
    con<U+FB01>ned to particular genera, but occur occasionally, and in certain
    species   of various  genera   apparently as the necessities       of the animal
    may render their presence          requisite.     Their o<U+FB01>ice is evidently to
    defend the sponge       from the attacks of predacious animals.             They
    are projected for about       half or two-thirds of their length at various
    angles from the surface of the sponge, or they are based on the
    <U+FB01>bre of the skeleton, and are projected at about right angles into its
    interstitial cavities.
       4th. The spicula of the membranes are of two distinct classes.
  [The office of the <U+FB01>rst of these is to strengthen and support those
    delicate tissues, and to communicate to them a certain amount of
    tension.     The forms     are few   in number, and their structure          com~
    paratively simple.      The o<U+FB02>ice of the      second class is that    of assisting
    in the retention of the       sarcode   on the interstitial     and other struc
    tures.    They    are usually minute      in size, and often very complicated
    in form.
        5th. Spicula of the sarcode.        The numerous and beautiful tribe of
    stellate spicula appear to be devoted to connect and give substance to
    the gelatinoid sarcode which so abundantly covers the whole of the
    interior membranous structures of the sponges in which they occur.
    They    are often exceedingly minute, and are occasionally remarkably
    complex and beautiful in structure, and               we frequently    <U+FB01>nd more
    than one form imbedded in the sarcode of the same sponge.
        6th. The spicula appropriated to the gemmules of sponges occur in
    various modes of disposition. First, they are imbedded irregularly in
     an external envelope of the gemmule, or on the surface of the
     gemmule itself at right angles          to lines radiating     from its centre.
     Secondly,    they are arranged        symmetrically       in the crust of the
    gemmule parallel to lines radiating from its centre.               Thirdly, they
     are disposed    in fasciculi in the substance of the gemmule from the
     centre to the circumference.
        The forms occurring         in the     second   class   of these spicula    are

                                              577
   °‘°°_°dinsly varied and         beautiful,   and especially characteristic     of the
   5'P9¢1es   in which      they occur.
      T111!   author has named and <U+FB01>gured the whole of the spicula de
  scribed in the paper, and has traced some of the most complicated
  Ones from their earliest and
                                          simplest state, through all the stages of
  their development to            the adult condition.       More   than   it  hundred
  distin<U+FB02>i f<U+FB02>rrns of these organs are thus              described, so as to render
  them available hereafter to naturalists as            characteristic of species.

 may be divided into a super<U+FB01>cial and a deep layer. Those of the
 super<U+FB01>cial layer may in turn be divided into three sets. The
 connexions of these are <U+FB01>rst followed out in detail; the <U+FB01>bres of the
 deep layer are described further on. In all mammali<U+FB02> these <U+FB01>bres
 are very distinct, but less intricate than in man. They may be
 found also in birds, reptiles, and <U+FB01>shes.
      The    ¢"l¢¢’?‘i01' pyramids    are found to be composed      of four orders of
 <U+FB01>bres     :—
      1 .  Decusaating <U+FB01>bres        from the lateral columns, forming their chief
 bulk.

      4.                                                       columns, separate     on

                              generally the decussating
 numerous        than      in ma n. In birds there is         an evident   but feeble
decussation       _

                                      578
   Of the corpora olivaria it is remarked, that they          are to be    found
not only in all mammalia, but also to a certain extent in birds.                 In
man, the surface of each olivary body consists of two layers of <U+FB01>bres
—transverse     and longitudinal;      the former in part belong to the
arciform system,—the      latter are continuous with the antero-lateral
column.     A broad transverse commissure unites the two bodies.             The
corpus dentatum is a convoluted vesicular sac, consisting of nucleated
cells of small and rather uniform size, from Tglqmth to I-7%-6th of
an inch in diameter, but varying in shape, and many of them send
ing out processes—some one, others two, three or more. The con
nexion of the <U+FB01>bres with the convolutions of the sac is extremely
complicated,    and not to be made intelligible           without    the aid      of
diagrams.     It  may be stated,      however, that the <U+FB01>bres which             are
con<U+FB01>ned to the cavity of the sac, with some others, take their origin
from the cells.
   In mammalia generally the olivary bodies             are nearly     concealed
behind the pyramids,     and vary in their appearance         at the surface     in
different animals.    The vesicular    sac, or corpus dentatum, is thrown
into only a few comparatively large convolutions.           On the outer      side
of  each olivary body, and separated from        it by a groove which lodges
the hypoglossal nerve, is another vesicular column, not hitherto de
scribed by anatomists, and of which the analogue is found in the
human medulla.
   As the <U+FB01>bres of the lateral columns           cross  over to the anterior
pyramids, the posterior cornua sink        as it  were forwards, while their
terminal    tufts—the gelatinous       substance, gradually       increasing in
bulk, reach the surface, and form the grey tubercles of Rolando.
At the    same time, and close to the posterior median <U+FB01>ssure, the grey
substance is raised into a small conical projection, from which anat
work of blood-vessels and <U+FB01>bres extends backwards into the posterior
pyramid.      Within the projection,      and amongst the network, cells
are developed, which    are circular,    pyriform,     or irregular    in shape,
and give off one process or several.       Further outwards, another,         but
larger projection   and another network        extend backwards into the
restiform body, containing cells of the same character, but             of  supe
rior  size.  These additional     productions    may be called respectively
the post-pyramidal and     1-estziform  ganglia.
   As   the medulla ascends,   the root of the posterior cornu and             the

                                               579
     _wh0le
                 of the    anterior cornu    are gradually   resolved or spread out
    into a. beautiful 8-nd complicated network, containing a multitude of
     variously-shaped cells, which communicate and surround with their
    P1'00esses the longitudinal bundles of the white columns enclosed in
     the meshes. The post-pyramidal and restiform ganglia continue to
    increase in size, as do also the terminal tufts of the posterior cornua,
     which, like        the former, are traversed by an extension of the network,
     and interspersed with cells. At the lower extremity of the olivary
     bodies, the decussation of the anterior pyramids, although still con
     siderable, is very much           reduced;   for while its <U+FB01>bres derived from
    the lateral columns have           been gradually decreasing      in number, those
    which proceed          from the posterior columns and posterior grey substance
    have been increasing, though not in the same proportion. These
    latter <U+FB01>bres may be traced backwards from the decussation chie<U+FB02>y to
    the restiform body and its ganglion, in which they wander in various
    directions,        crossing each other, and becoming longitudinal.
         In front,       and at the side of the central canal, a new group or        co
    lumn of cells begins to make its appearance,—the nucleus of the
    hypoglossal nerve ; and behind and on each side of the canal appears
    the nucleus of the spinal-accessory nerve, which is connected with its
    fellow of the opposite side, at the bottom of the posterior <U+FB01>ssure, by
    a.  transverse band of <U+FB01>bres,—the            continuation of the posterior com
    missure of the medulla spinalis.                Of  the spinal-accessory nerve,
    some      of    the upper roots proceed to their own nucleus, while Others
    bend        forwards into the hypoglossal nucleus, and in part join its
    <U+FB01>bres, to decussate           through the raphe with those of the opposite
   nerve.          The vagus      nerve arises from a continuation of the spinal
    accessory nucleus,           and,   on its way outwards,      passes   through the
    terminal tufts of         the‘posterior cornu, or the    so-called gelatinous   sub
    -rl‘¢l<U+FB02>¢'¢-    The Vagal and spinal-accessory vesicular nuclei or columns,
    after aPPea1'i-D8 in the fourth ventricle, and diverging so as to expose
    the hypoglossal nucleus, sink abruptly beneath a new mass of                   vesi
    eular substance which makes its appearance on each side of the                 ven
   f1'1'¢1e-     ThiS' is the      auditory ganglion.   It  commences by a point on
?  the Outer         Side  of   the vagql nucleus, with which it is intimately con
  nected,    and       is  developed from the inner part of the post-pyramidal
  ganglioil    -      Its   cells  are various in shape, and    as  they are developed

                                   580
 from the inner part of the posterior pyramid, the outer side of the
 latter undergoes a remarkable change of structure, and becomes the
 chief origin of the anterior division of the auditory    nerve, which    in
 its course outwards runs between the restiform body and the gelati
 nous substance or posterior cornu.      The posterior division of the
 nerve winds transversely inwards over the restiform       body   _to reach
 the auditory ganglion.
    Intimately connected with the auditory nerves and ganglia is the
 structure which, in animals, is called the trapezium, and which the
author has found to enclose a remarkable vesicular sac resembling
that of the olivary bodies.    The analogue of the trapezium exists in
the human medulla.
    The facial   nerve, or portio  dura of the seventh, after passing
through the trapezium, proceeds transversely inwards to the fasci
culus teres, which contains a mass or column of stellate cells, and
through which it spreads, exchanging <U+FB01>bres or forming a loop with
the sixth or abducens nerve, which arises from the same nucleus.
The glossopharyngeal nerve has more than one origin.             It passes
out in several bundles through the gelatinous substance or posterior
cornu, in which it forms a plexus with longitudinal           fascieuli of
<U+FB01>bres which may be traced upwards to the larger root of the <U+FB01>fth
nerve.
    The connecting <U+FB01>bres between the anterior and posterior portions
of the medulla are very numerous and complicated. For convenience
of description, they may      be divided  into   two  parts,—super<U+FB01>cial
and deep.      The super<U+FB01>cial  are the superior layers   of the arciform
system, and arise from the restiform body and its ganglion:             the
deep    <U+FB01>bres, more or less    blended with the <U+FB01>rst, arise from the
remains of the post-pyramidal and the restiform ganglia.         Together
they form a complicated network, or plexus, interspersed with innu
merable and variously shaped cells, which frequently communicate
around the longitudinal     bundles of the lateral    columns,    through
which and the olivary body the <U+FB01>bres of the plexus proceed forwards
and inwards to the raphe, where they decussate with those            of the
opposite side, and become continuous with the arciform <U+FB01>bres which
were traced to the raphe round the anterior pyramids as the super
<U+FB01>cial set.    The raphe, therefore, is the  seat  of a very complicated

                                                                                                         1       F

  in<U+FB02>ammation in the Frog’s foot. The paper is divided into f0“?

     In the introduction it is observed, that “so far from our l<U+FB02>1°w’

    study of the early stages of in<U+FB02>ammation in the foot of the frog will
    apply in all strictness to the same morbid process in man.”
       The remainder of the introduction        is occupied  with   a sketch    of the
    principal   theories which      have    been   proposed to account for the
    obstruction to the progress of the blood-corpuscles in the early stages
    of in<U+FB02>ammation.
       The <U+FB01>rst section of the paper is devoted to the discussion of the
   aggregation of the corpuscles of the blood. It is shown by the author
   that the rouleauw      “ are simply the result of the disk-form of the cor
   puscles, together with a certain, though slight degree of adhesiveness
   which retains them pretty <U+FB01>rmly attached together when in the posi
   tion most favourable for its operation, namely when <U+FB02>at surface is
   applied to <U+FB02>at surface, but otherwise allows them to slip very readily
   upon one another.”         The aggregating tendency of the red disks is
   thus regarded as a      phenomenon similar in kind, though inferior in
   degree, to the well-known       adhesiveness     of the white corpuscles.        It
   is further shown, from numerous experiments, that the red corpuscles
   vary remarkably in adhesiveness,          in consequence   of  changes    in phy
   sical circumstances, or very slight chemical action.
       Section  II.  is on the structure and functions of the blood-vessels.
       Allusion is  made to a paper by the author which        will shortly appear
   in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, where he has
   recorded the observation, that in the smallest arteries of the web of
   the frog’s foot the middle coat is composed of muscular <U+FB01>bre-cells
  wrapped spirally round the internal membrane.               The   parietes   of the
  minute arteries are thus provided with             a most eflicient mechanism
  for diminution of calibre, and contrast in this respect very strikingly
  with the delicate nucleated membrane which constitutes the wall of
  a capillary.      The functions of the two sets of vessels are described
  as being    in harmony with     these differences    in structure   ; the arteries
  being specially characterized by contractility,           while the capillaries
- exhibit only such changes of calibre as are explained by elasticity.
      The thinness of the capillary wall is believed to favour the mutual
  interchanges between the blood and the tissues, but the consideration
  of  some facts    of physiology    leads   the author to the conclusion, that
  notwithstanding       the distending force of the current of blood, the              _
  liquor sanguinis is not effuscd as       a  whole among the tissues         in the
  state   of health; and this is thought         to imply that there subsists       a

    Subsequent      experiments with a variety of other irritating agents
showed that the corpuscles, both red and white, were obstructed in
their progress through         the irritated    part, in consequence         of their
tending to adhere in an abnormal               degree    to one another       and to
the walls of the vessels.         The eifects upon the blood were always
similar, although the means employed to produce irritation were
exceedingly various, such as solutions of salts, mustard, essential
oils, chloroform, heat, galvanic shock, mechanical violence, &c.
   The irritant     was generally so applied as to act only upon a small
area  of   one  of the   webs,   and it was found that the abnormal ad
hesiveness     of the blood-corpuscles was in the <U+FB01>rst instance always
precisely limited to the spot which had been thus acted on, though
it frequently extended afterwards more or less to surrounding parts.
At the same time the vessels of the irritated spot did not differ
materially in calibre from those in its vicinity which participated in
the arterial     dilatation induced by the stimulus.               The  exact  corre
spondence between the extent of the irritant application, and that                 of
the effect upon the blood, showed that the latter must be due to
direct action either upon the blood itself or the tissues of the web.
That it was not the result            of direct action upon the blood            was
evident from the two following           considerations.        In the <U+FB01>rst place,
most of the agents         employed to cause       irritation, when applied to
freshly    drawn blood, either had no effect upon the corpuscles, or
destroyed instead        of increasing their      adhesiveness.         Secondly,   if
employed so as to act mildly on the web, they induced an abnormal
condition     of the blood, short of actual stagnation though very ap
parent, namely, slow movement of numerous and adhesive corpus
cles; and this state of things might last, although the time of
operation of the irritant was           often limited      to   a   few seconds,   or
even a    still briefer period.     Long after all the blood which could
possibly    have been      directly acted on had left the vessels of the
part,   successive    fresh portions     continued      to experience precisely

        the conclusion previously arrived at, that the accumulation of the
        blood-corpuscles was simply the result of their abnormal adhesive
        ness.         At the same time these experiments brought out the remark
         able fact, that mere quiescence of the blood does not give rise to 88'

         are in an unhealthy condition in consequence of irritation. It
  \      further       appeared that the corpuscles never exhibit greater adhesive
         ness within the         vessels of an in<U+FB02>amed part, than do those of blood

                At the commencement of Section IV., “ on the state of the tissues
             in in<U+FB02>ammation,” it is stated that “the conclusion arrived at in

   in<U+FB02>amed part behaves            itself in the    same    way as when separated
   from the living body, naturally leads us to infer that the tissues                      of
  the in<U+FB02>amed part are in some degree approximated                        to the condition
  of    dead matter, or, in other words, have suffered                    a diminution    of
  power to discharge the o<U+FB02>ices peculiar to them as components of the
  healthy      animal     frame.      This inference     is     strongly     supported by
   considering what common effect is likely to be produced upon the
   tissues  of the frog’s     web by all the various agents                known to cause
   in<U+FB02>ammatory disturbance of the circulation.’

   that all these agents, though differing greatly in their nature, agree
  in their tendency to in<U+FB02>ict            a lesion on the part to which              they are
   applied, and impair         the functional      activity     of the tissues.        “But
   strong as are the arguments thus obtained by inference, it would
   be    very desirable to con<U+FB01>rm            them   by direct observation             of the
   tissues.     It  fortunately happens that the pigmcntary                  system   of the
   frog is a tissue which,          from its peculiar      form and colour, is very
  apparent to the eye, so that it is easy to trace the remarkably active
   functions with which          it is endowed, and their modi<U+FB01>cations under
  the in<U+FB02>uence of irritation.”
       The author then mentions the circumstances which led him to
  notice that the dark pigment of the frog presents remarkable differ
   ences   of appearance      at different times     in  one and the same            animal;
  each     dark patch being sometimes of stellate <U+FB01>gure with minutely
  ramifying rays, at other times in the form of                  a   small rounded spot.
  These changes had been before observed by some German writers,
  who attributed the rounded form to contraction of the branching
                                                                                              ‘

            a  supplementary section                    anatomy         and  physiology of
  the pigmentary system of the frog,” shows that the cells never change
  in form or       size, but that the pigment-granules             which are suspended
  in   a colourless <U+FB02>uid are capable of being, on the one hand, attracted
  by   a  central force into     a  small space in the body of the cell, and, on
  the other hand, dispersed by              a  repulsive power into the minutest
  recesses    of the ramifying rays. Both concentration and diffusion of
  the pigment may take place with great rapidity, implying remark
  able energy in the attractive and repulsive forces, both of which
E appear to reside in a nucleus.            The supplementary section concludes

           Fungi.”      By Fnnnmuox CURREY, Esq.                   Communicated

                                       (Abstract. )
       The author refers to the recent inquiries into the diversities of
    form existing in the reproductive organs of Fungi, and notices the
    physiological importance of the results, and the probable future effect
    upon systematic arrangement.
       Two different    classes   of Sphaeriaceous Fungi       are then noticed     in
    detail, in the former of which the different forms of fruit produced
    are essentially distinct,   whilst in the latter the fruit    is modi<U+FB01>ed so as
    to assume a form materially different from the normal form.
        The following are the plants included in the former of        these classes,
  _
    with the principal points noticed in each.

    and cytisporous state of fructi<U+FB01>cation within the same circumscribing
    line, and the nature of the cells constituting that line.

    spores  within   a conceptacle common to both, and having            a  common
    ori<U+FB01>ce.
        6. Sp<U+FB01>wriafragzformis, Pers.          Description of a secondary form
    of fruit belonging to the Splueria, hitherto considered to have been
    a  growth parasitical upon it.
        7. Spluzria salicina,      Pers.,  and    Coniothecium      Amentacearum,
    Corda.     The production of these Fungi (hitherto             supposed to be
    distinct plants) from the same mycelium,             and the probability     of  a
    similar relation between Sphwria lancg'/‘ormis,         Fr., and  Coniot/zecium

mentary canal, and its relations to the liver and large ovary; and
describes    a large viscus situated   in the  space between the ovary, the
adductor muscle, the base of the foot and the pericardium, divided
into a central and two lateral portions, and secreting a dark brown
liquid loaded with fatty matter. This body he thinks may be con
nected with the secretion of the byssus, but, at the same time,
 remarks     that it may be homologous         with the organ of Bojanus.
 Lastly, the anatomy of the heart and great arteries is         given,  and is
 in substance     as follows.
     On cutting through the <U+FB02>oor of the cloaca, the pericardium is laid
 open, and in it is seen the large, rather square-shaped ventricle, with
 a capacious but thin-walled auricle opening into it on either side,
 through     an ori<U+FB01>ce guarded     by semilunar valves.    From the thick
 walled ventricle, a short tube conducts into a conical dilatation or
  bulbus    arteriosus,   with muscular walls, having its     base   included
 in    the  pericardium,     and  giving  rise near its narrow end to the
  anterior    and   posterior  pallial  arteries;  whilst a  visceral   artery
  passes from the ventricle to the ovary and adjacent parts.            As in
  other bivalves, the intestine, before its termination, passes through
  the    heart: in coming through the pericardium, surrounded by
  that membrane, it forms a short round pedicle which joins the fore
  part of the ventricle; it is then continued through the ventricle and
  bulbus arteriosus,      and <U+FB01>nally   opens into   the cloaca.    The blood
  from the ventricle <U+FB02>ows between        the outer surface of the intestine
  and the inside       of the sanguiferous channel; and “that part of
  the intestine which traverses the bulbus arteriosus is closely sur
  rounded with elongated membranous valvulae, which arise from the
  anterior part of the chamber where the gut enters, and are <U+FB01>xed by
  a number     of cordae tendineae to the posterior wall, where   it makes its
  exit;” a contrivance which permits the blood to          pass   between the
  rectum and the little valves, but prevents its re<U+FB02>ux.
      The description is illustrated by drawings of the exterior of the
  animal and of the particular parts specially referred to, and also by a
   diagram representing the general arrangement and relative position
   of the  several organs.

       I  have  found that the olivary tract of the medulla oblongata is
   both sensitive and motor, although it is not, as           I have tried to prove
   elsewhere,    a leader    for sensibility and voluntary movements.
       II.  Some experiments which           I made    two or three       years ago,
   and many that          I have   recently performed,      show that the lateral
   columns of the spinal cord in the neighbourhood               of themedulla   ob
   longata, and a part of the anterior gray matter, are the principal,             if
   not the only channels for voluntary              movements      in that region.
   Lower     down in the spinal cord (in the dorsal and lumbar regions),
   the anterior columns and the gray matter seem to have alone the
   function    of conductors for voluntary movements. If a transverse
   section be made of one of the lateral columns with almost the whole
Q
  of the anterior horn of gray matter, about          an inch behind the medulla
  oblongata, we <U+FB01>nd voluntary movements almost completely lost on
  that side.       If   a transverse section be made       of  one  of the anterior
  columns of the spinal cord, an inch behind the medulla oblongata,
  we     <U+FB01>nd   that    voluntary    movements      are   not    much   diminished;
  and, as in this        case, we divide also a part    of the gray matter, and
  frequently a part also       of the lateral column, it seems that the ante
  rior column there has but little to do with voluntary movements.
 Other experiments lead to the same conclusion; I will relate the
 following alone      :  the anterior columns of the cord, when arrived at the
 medulla oblongata, are known to send most of their <U+FB01>bres into the
 lateral parts of this nervous centre, where they may be divided easily.
 I   have found, after the transverse section of the lateral column of
 the medulla oblongata, that the voluntary movements are very little
 diminished, and sometimes hardly at all.
     Besides,   if  we divide longitudinally     the medulla oblongata, where
the pyramids         cross each other, we <U+FB01>nd that the voluntary              move
ments are completely lost in both sides of the body.                     There are
convulsive and re<U+FB02>ex           movements, but no spontaneous regular move
meat, and the animals, when put on their feet, fall on one side or
the other.
     From    these facts and many others,       it seems   :
     lst. That the anterior pyramids of the medulla oblongata                  con
tain most of the voluntary motor nerve-<U+FB01>bres.
     2nd. That in the cervical region of the spinal cord, the voluntary

mentioned as observed after the section of the sympathetic nerve in
the neck, have been discovered                            by   Prof. Bernard; the others have

  IV. “Experimental         Researches        on the In<U+FB02>uence of Efforts          of
          Inspiration    on the Movements              of the Heart.”      By E.
          BROWN-S<U+FB01>QUARD,             M.D.         Communicated        by   JAMES
          Paoar, Esq., F.R-.S.           Received June 25, 1857.
    A   very interesting fact, of which many circumstances have been
 carefully investigated by Professor Donders and Dr. S.              W. Mitchell,
 has received a wrong        explanation from those physiologists.            This
 fact consists in a diminution        of either the strength or the frequency
 of the beatings of the heart, when an energetic effort at breathing
 is made and maintained for half a minute or a little more.                   Pro
 fessor   Donders    thinks that this in<U+FB02>uence of inspiration on the
 heart is due     to a mechanical agency of the dilated lungs on this
 organ.
    They admit that the       state    of the lungs has a great in<U+FB02>uence on
the heart, but the principal          cause of the diminution in the move
 ments   of this organ is very different from what has been supposed
by Professor Donders, by Professor J. Mueller, and others.                   It is
known that when the medulla oblongata, or the par vagum are ex
cited (either by galvanism, as the Brothers Weber have discovered,
or by other means, such as a mere compression, or a sudden wound,
as  I  have   found),  the heart's beatings diminish            or cease entirely.
Whether this stoppage         be due      to the cause     I have attributed  it to
or not, is indiiferent     to my present          object.    What is important
is, that in these cases an      irritation on the origin of the par vagum
acts through     it on the heart       to diminish      or to destroy its action.

Itwould be easy to show that the in<U+FB02>uence of the inspiratory effort
on the central organ of circulation is comparable to the change
taking place in the pupil when the globe of the eye is drawn inwards                                :
it is an   associated    action.
     From the facts     I   have found         in the    case       of newly-born animals and
birds, and from the facts observed in man by Professors                               J.    Mueller,
Donders, and others, it results that, during efforts at inspiration,                                a
nervous     in<U+FB02>uence        passes       along    the par vagum from the medulla
oblongata to the heart, diminishing                      the movements of this organ.
And as by an action of our will                        we    may inspire with energy, it
follows that we can by an in<U+FB02>uence of our will diminish                                    the action
of our heart, just       as we can contract our                 pupil by drawing our            eyes

           Communicated by AMES Paonr, Esq., F.R.S. Received
           June 25, 1857.
   The in<U+FB02>uence of oxygen and carbonic acid on the living tissues,
has been very little investigated, either by physiologists or practi
tioners of medicine.   I have made a great many experiments on
this subject, but will relate here merely a few of them, which are
su<U+FB02>icient     to show that              oxidation of the spinal cord and nerves, as
well as that of muscles, increases                     their vital properties, sometimes
in a high degree.
     After the opening of the spinal canal, the dura-mater being laid
bare, we     <U+FB01>nd that an evident hypereesthesia appears after a short
time in the parts of the body which are behind the opening, and
also on the       same       level with          it,   and   a      little   above   it.   I   think
this increase of sensibility                 depends on the absorption                 of oxygen.
To ascertain that       it   is   so,    with the help of            a   special apparatus, im
mediately after laying bare the cord,   pump out the air in contact

     From these facts,    and  a  great many others, it results that in the
 spinal cord, the sensitive and motor nerves, and the sympathetic, as
 well as in muscles, there is an increase of the vital properties produced
 by oxygen.
  VI. “Summary         of  a  paper    (to be presented)     on the Power
        possessed by   Motor and Sensitive Nerves of retaining their
        Vital Properties longer than Muscles, when deprived of
        Blood.”     By E. Baown-SI~':QUARn, M.D. Communicated
        by JAMES PAGET, Esq., F.R.S.            Received July 3, 1857.
     It is an admitted doctrine that the vital properties      of motor and
 sensitive nerves disappear much sooner than those of muscles,         after
 death, or when they are deprived of blood.           Although founded on
 positive facts, this theory is not correct, these    facts being capable of
 another interpretation.      In the experiments made heretofore, other
 organs (such as the spinal cord and muscles) had been deprived of
 blood, at the same time with the sensitive and motor nerves.            To
 ascertain the in<U+FB02>uence of the deprivation of blood on nerves alone, it
 was necessary    to experiment otherwise than has been done hitherto.
 I  will in this short summary show, only by       a few experiments taken
 at random among many, that the essential         vital properties of sensi
 tive and motor nerves can last longer than muscular irritability after
 a complete or almost complete deprivation       of blood.
    Exp. l.—After having placed ligatures around the arteries of the
upper part of the thigh of a young Guinea-pig, I amputated the
limb, leaving the sciatic and crural nerves uninjured.         In the whole
length of the thigh    I then   laid bare these nerves, and dissected their
neurilemma all along, so as to cut away as much as possible the
little supply of blood they received from above.           Voluntary move
ments existed about 8 minutes in the amputated leg; excitation of
the trunks of the exposed nerves continued to produce muscular con
tractions for 6 minutes more.
    In the whole length of the amputated limb,         10 minutes after the
operation, sensibility    was greater than in the other limbs.        Mus
cular irritability disappeared in the amputated leg from 30 to           510

Besides, in one of the experiments         I have  mentioned, the sensibility
had been increased in consequence            of the section of the posterior
columns of the spinal cord.          I  will therefore relate     an experiment
in which there     was no cause    of increase  of the vital properties of the
sensitive nerves.
    Exp.  3.-On a vigorous       adult male Guinea-pig      I  tied the common
iliac artery, on the two sides, at 15 minutes past three,           PJ/I.
    At 3'25 very weak voluntary movements remained in the posterior
limbs; their sensibility almost normal.
    From 3'25 to 3'35 slight convulsions in the posterior limbs.
    At 4 o’clock muscular irritability was much diminished in the
posterior limbs    ;  sensibility not so much diminished.
    At 4'30 cadaveric rigidity had begun everywhere, in the posterior
limbs   ; sensibility, though greatly diminished, still existed.
    At 5'20 cadaveric rigidity very strong;          traces   of sensibility still
very evident.
    At 5'50 the last    traces  of sensibility disappeared.
    This experiment shows that the vital property of sensitive nerves,
deprived of blood, lasts longer than that of muscles in the same
circumstances.
    In the experiments      made    by other physiologists       on this subject,
they had put a ligature around the aorta, suf<U+FB01>ciently high to diminish
circulation in the lumbar region of the spinal cord, and the loss               of
sensibility    which   then soon took place in the posterior limbs de
pended upon the diminution          of function of the spinal cord, and, as
my experiments show, not on the loss of the vital property of the
 sensitive nerves of the posterior limbs.
    To <U+FB01>nd out the dilference of duration of the vital property of
motor nerves and of that of muscles, I have made many experiments
of the following kind      :-
    Exp. 4.‘-—I laid bare the sciatic nerve in the whole length of the
thigh of a strong adult Rabbit, and dissected its neurilemma, so as
to cut away all the small blood-vessels running on this nerve.             I then
did the same thing       with the crural nerve.      Three hours afterwards,
a slight    diminution    of voluntary    movement and of sensibility         was
 observed;     two hours later, sensibility and voluntary movement were
 still persisting, though notably diminished.
    Five hours still later, sensibility      had increased, while voluntary

                                            603
movement remained the same.                   I then divided the two nerves as
high as possible, and, <U+FB02>fraid that there might be some small blood
V<U+FB01>ssels still giving blood to the nerves, I dissected the whole length
Of their trunk for the Becond time. Near the section, the nerve-‘I
1'¢mained able       to cause   muscular contractions for seven hours.
     Experiments       more or less similar to this one have given very
nearly     the same results,    and  I am   therefore led to conclude that, with.
the    least quantity of blood,        motor nerves retain their vital property
very      much longer       than   muscles.       If   motor    nerves     in  a   limb
separated from the body of a living animal seem to lose their vital
 property sooner than muscles, it is because, as I will prove in
 another paper, the transmission of the nervous force from the last
 nervous rami<U+FB01>cations to the contractile elements of muscles, soon
 becomes impossible in the absence of blood charged vvith oxygen.
      From the facts above related, and from many others, I think I am
 entitled to conclude that the vital properties of motor and sensitive                    I
 nerves may last longer without blood than muscular irritability.                       H

      Our     visual   organs    are   not   only    capable,    by    an    adjusting
  lenticular system, of painting,          under varying conditions, images-of
  luminous objects, upon a membrane in special relation with the
   brain, but      involve many adjuvant structures; and thus it happens
   that    they reveal     to  us   a number     of adventitious       phenomena-—
   spectres      as we may     call them,     whether    caused by light~ at the
    parts that     cover  the eyeballs, or within them, or by any stimulus
    Whatever affecting the special nervous tract.            These must be elimi
    nated,    if  we  would avoid      the risk of ascribing       effects   begotten
     by  subordinate     parts to more integral       portions of the apparatus.

Finally, they may be rendered serviceable for the solution of certain
important points of ocular structure and function.                        Under the im
pression that so diversi<U+FB01>ed             a subject has       not yet received all the
elucidation of which it is susceptible, another methodical attempt to
investigate it will be made in this memoir.
      When light is an agent in the production of the spectral pheno
-mena, they arise from certain rays being blocked from their course,
 at some obstacle they encounter, or turned aside by refraction, re<U+FB02>ec
 tion or in<U+FB02>ection.        And to make precise observations upon them, we
 must use     <U+FB01>ne pencils of rays which do not return to foci upon the
 retina.     In order to estimate the relative           and actual sizes, localities,
 and characters, of corpuscles whose shadows or images are projected
 upon the retina, pencils            of light which        are <U+FB01>rst      convergent, and
 therefrom,      by passing        through foci, divergent (such               as may be
 conveniently       obtained      from a small disc of light at                a   sufficient
 distance from the eye, when viewed through a lens of an inch focal
 length), are mainly employed, the foci being carried from before the
 eye to various depths        in its interior *.    If we neglect ocular refractions,
 whether a body fall in the convergent or divergent portions, the
 length of its shadow will be to its own, as their respective distances
 from the focus.         With     a couple   of such pencils, whether            a body   fall
 in the convergent or divergent portions, the distance between its pair
 of shadows is to that between the foci, as that of the object from
 the shadow screen (retina) to that of the object from the line (parallel
      * In the Allgem. Encyklop. der Physik, s. 166 (1856), in an able article on
 “ Entoptics,” Helmholtz states, that “the more decided entoptical ‘ methods '
  were established    <U+FB01>rst by Listing and Brewster (1845), who were followed still
 later by Donders (I846-51).” The present writer refers to a paper of his own,
  published early in 1845, which substantially gives the methods alluded to ; which
  are all modi<U+FB01>cations   of one idea, that of obtaining     a greater   parallactic deviation
  of  shadows for objects further from the retina, by means of two pencils of rays
  diverging from points in front of the eye, or by one moved across the optic axis.
  Now we can by this device only get marked         differences   in parallax for small dif
  ferences in ocular depth     for objects  very near to the points      of divergence,   that
  is, near the surface of the eye; whereas the plan now proposed          not only generally
  secures this end in a notable degree, but by placing foci between any two objects,
   causes their shadows    to be de<U+FB02>ected in opposite      directions, and the more con
   siderably as they are-nearer together   ; besides supplying,   it is believed, a variety of
   aids in entoptical researches.

to     the screen)     which joins the foci. But the de<U+FB02>ections of th<U+FB01>
Shadow in the two sorts of rays are in adverse directions, so that if
the axis of a      single pencil were moved across the eye, Whilst always
kcpt parallel      to itself, the shadows of all the objects lying in advance
of     the focus would      travel in one direction, whilst those of object-8
lying behind the focus would travel in the opposite, the rate of
movement being in both instances greater for objects nearer the focus.
 Also,     whether with a couple of pencils or a single one in movement,
 for     a given difference in ocular depth between two objects, the
 di<U+FB01>'crence in parallactic deviation is greater as the two objects are
 nearer the foci or focus. Besides, generally, the picture of the
 contents of the eye,       as shown    by    the convergent portion, is inverted
 in the divergent.                          _
      The above proportions are turned into equations which indicate, as
 the terms alter their values, every observed variation in the sizes of
 the shadows, parallactic deviations, inversions of <U+FB01>gure, place, and
 movements whether of the ocular bodies with respect to the pencils,
 or of the foci and axes of the pencils with respect to them. Thus,
 in    many    modes,   which   are   explained, we may at pleasure by mere
 inspection observe the structural and relative positions of the bodies
 in question, and can so manage to evade the effects of ocular refrac
 tions,     as to render the    proportions above stated available for calcu
  lating    the sizes of the bodies, and their distances from the cornea,
  iris,   faces of the crystalline lens, retina, or from any one of themselves
  —or      can even measure their depths in the eye, almost without cal
  culation, and free from any that involve the consideration of the
  optical     qualities of the organ.
        In<U+FB02>ective phenomena         are alike in the convergent    and divergent

    cision  than in previously     existing accounts of them.       Little bars
    of <U+FB02>uid along the margins of the lids are shown to occasion the long
    beams of light, which issue from <U+FB02>ames regarded “with winking
    eyes,” by their annulling the refractions of the cornea. These beams
    have been ascribed to re<U+FB02>ection at the edges of the lids, but re<U+FB02>ection
    only yields a very pale beam which can be distinguished easily from      I
    the other.

       The margin of the iris, opaque and transparent bodies, and the
    structural stellate <U+FB01>gure, in the crystalline lens are placed methodi
    cally in the order      which they lie in the depths of the eye, and

    look at thin objects, or black and white lines, especially       if  curved,
    render some singular illusions, which are dissected.
       The method by the two sorts of pencils may           be applied    to test
    the recent doctrine advanced by Stellweg, that the iris so lies on
    the face of the crystalline lens, that there is no posterior chamber
    in the aqueous humour, and will probably be found to disprove it.
       A  calculation is entered into to show that unless Dr.     T. Young

 SECTION l'V.—-Apparitions from                        the Vitreous Humour,         applied to
                                      explain   its    Structure.
      It   can be observed         that, in the posterior chamber            of the   eye there
 exists      a law,   irregular, <U+FB01>brous network, springing from the hyaloizl
 membrane, but spanning the crystalline lens, without attachment
 to its       capsule,    occupying       principally the peripheral portion of the
 cavity, but spreading              as  one structure into its interior, towards an
 ever-lessening         number ofpleading <U+FB01>bres.                    The whole system is of
 less speci<U+FB01>c, gravity than the vitreous <U+FB02>uid, either of itself, or by
 being the framework of membrane, in more or less of its extent.
  The fibres        are constituted          entirely       of rows of beads, which are
  round, or nearly so,             transparent, and of greater refractive power
  than the <U+FB02>uid, and joined by passing into one another by small
 portions of their surface. The dynamical and optical considerations
  upon which            these conclusions          depend, are very carefully entered
  into, and the         nicer points illustrated with appropriate drawings *.

         *   The 36th vol.       pp.   97-104, of the Lond.        Med. Gazette, is quoted to
    show that the writer maintained          in 1845   that  the usual musc<U+FB02>i volitantes are but
    apparitions of portions of the essential structure of the vitreous body, and that
    he then fundamentally and clearly enunciated the view now more particularly
     developed. Other writers have regarded these as remnants of the foetal eye: M‘
     as  pathological    fragments,    <U+FB02>oating  freely, or in loculi of the vitreous   humour:
     for   the most part     differing   very widely from the reasonings     and conclusions  in
     this  essay.   The writings     of Brewster, Donders, Doncan, &c., are referred to

membrane in such a manner as to penetrate from the side of the
hyaloid membrane outwards from the eye’s centre, deeper                                        as they
approach the punetum aureum.                            They may        be called    into view by
any pencil of rays that is in the act of sweeping over the retina.
In the well-known                    experiment   of Purkinje, of waving a candle
<U+FB02>ame before the eye,                  the radiating point is the image of the <U+FB02>ame
at the back of the eye.                     In this experiment the              vessels    display a
remarkable parallactic gliding over the visual <U+FB01>eld, <U+FB01>rst observed                                 by
Gudden, in 1849; but it was left for                         H. Miiller,     a few years after,
to point out the cause                     of the phenomenon, and            to calculate from
entoptical observations the distance of the vessels from the“per
                 ”
ceiving membrane   lying without them, required to account for the
parallax.            This    his hypothesis, but supports it by in
                               essay adopts
dependent observations, and substitutes another mode of calculating
the said distance.
     The <U+FB02>ame is            made to pause successively, on opposite sides                       of the
vessel to be observed,                in   an ocular meridional plane, or that              of   some
great circle, so that the shadow may be seen to deviate equally, twice
in   one plane, from the retinal radius that passes through                           it,   and this
whole angle,     noted, as well as that, at, between the two positions

   The parallaxes here suggested would all take place in the direc

at the same time, However, these other versions of the <U+FB01>gure are
 eliminated by being traced to other sources, and with H. Miller, the
 central dark spot       is   treated as the shadow of the wall of the foramen
 centrale; so that          the sentient surface must be without the brim                 of
 the foramen.

     by the <U+FB02>itting away of objects from our sight, burying some in quasi

     origin of the phenomenon was undetected, occasioning many sur
     mises upon the inherent qualities of the special nervous structure in
     order to account for them.            An observation upon the inverted image
     of   a candle    formed at the posterior        face  of the crystalline lens is
     mentioned, which indicates other muscular action besides that which
     rotates the eyeball, when the eye is vehemently strained, as if the
     lens becomes <U+FB02>attened.             The phenomena which inform us of a dif
      ferential structure in the retinal surface, with respect to the punctum
      ceecum, foramen centrale, and the elementary rods and cones, which
      H. Miiller    believes to constitute the sentient layer, are adduced; as well
      as the conclusions to which we are led, after eliminating           the various
      phenomena studied, as regards the ultimate structure of the sentient
      surface.

 Maguire to the Admiralty, and were in due course transmitted to
 General Sabine, by whom they were subjected to the same processes
 of   reduction as those in the colonial         observatories:   the results are
 given and     discussed   in this communication.
     A   su<U+FB02>icient body    of the larger disturbances      to permit an exami
 nation of their laws having been separated from the rest of the ob
 servations, it was found at Point Barrow, as elsewhere wherever a
 similar investigation has been made, that in regard to the frequency
 of their occurrence, and to the mean amounts of easterly and west
 erly    de<U+FB02>ection produced      by them, the disturbances         follow system
 atic laws depending on the hours of solar time.                The laws of the
 easterly    and  of the westerly disturbances were also found, at Point
 Barrow as elsewhere, to be distinct and dissimilar.               On further in
 stituting a comparison between the disturbance-laws at Point Barrow
 and Toronto, it was found that although the laws of the de<U+FB02>ections
 of    the   same   name     at the two stations did not correspond, there
 existed, on the other hand, a very striking and remarkable correspond
 ence between the laws of the easterly disturbances at Point Barrow
  and of the westerly at Toronto, and between the laws of the westerly
  disturbances      at Point Barrow     and easterly at Toronto.         The corre
  spondence is traced in much         detail, for the purpose   of showing th<U+FB02>t
  it is manifested, not in slight     and unimportant    particulars, but in the
  most marked characteristics of both           classes of phenomena.             From
   the   correspondence in the hours at which opposite disturbance-deil6C
   tions prevail, it follows, that the portion of the diurnal variation
    which depends upon the disturbances, has opposite, or nearly
    opposite   characteristics  at the tW0 9t<U+FB02>ti0l1S

 in<U+FB02>uence of that portion         of the observed diurnal variation          which
 proceeds from the disturbances;            and he now adduces the observa
 tions at Point Barrow as strongly con<U+FB01>rmatory of this.                 ‘When the
 diurnal variation is derived from the whole body of the observations
 at Point Barrow, retaining the disturbances, the westerly extreme               of
 the diurnal excursion, which, as          is well known, occurs generally       in
 the extra-tropical     part of the northern hemisphere at a little after
  1  P.M., is found to take place at           11 P.M.   ;   but when the larger
 disturbances are omitted,         the westerly extreme falls        at the same
 hour     as elsewhere,    viz.  a  little after  1  I-.M.'    The author     takes
 occasion to suggest       the probability     that the anomalies which have
 been    supposed to exist elsewhere        in the turning-hours      of the solar
 diurnal variation in high latitudes may            be susceptible    of  a similar
 explanation.
     It appears,  therefore, by the comparison of the Point Barrow and
 Toronto observations, that in the regular solar diurnal variation the
 progression at the two stations is similar, the easterly and westerly
  extremes being reached nearly at the same hours; whilst in the
  disturbance diurnal variation the progression is reversed, the easterly
  extreme at the one station coinciding very nearly with the westerly
  extreme at the other.        This contrariety    seems the more remarkable,
  since both variations appear to have the same primary                or exciting
  cause, viz. the  sun; inasmuch        as in  each the period is a solar day.
  The author draws        the probable inference, that whilst the primary
  cause is the same     in both, the mode of operation is different in the
  two cases.
     Another important        distinction    between    the phenomena of the
  solar diurnal variation and of the disturbance variation at Point Bar
 row and Toronto, is shown by the author to consist in the comparative
 magnitude of their range. The increase in the range of the solar diurnal
 variation between Toronto and Point Barrow is, as nearly as may be,
 in the inverse ratio of the values of the horizontal force of the earth
 at the two stations (which is the antagonistic force opposing all
 magnetic variations); whilst on the other hand, the increase in the
 range of the disturbance variation            is many'ti1"nes    greater than it
 would be according to the same proportion.                It would appear there
 fore that the absolute disturbing force must be much greater at Point
 Barrow than at Toronto; suggesting the question, by what physical

                                            613
or    other conditions is the locality distinguished at which the disturb
ing force is a maximum.
      In correspondence With the great amount of the absolute disturb
ing force at Point Barrow is the frequency of the concomitant auro
ral     manifestations,    Which greatly exceed that of any previous record
known to the author. It was the custom at Point Barrow to attach
 it distinguishing mark to all the hourly magnetic observations which
 were      made when the Aurora was visible.              Taking the months of
  December, January, and February              as those in which, in the latitude
 of Point Barrow,        there is nearly a constant absence of day-light, there
 were,     in those three months in 1852-1853, 1788 hourly observations,
  at    461 of which the Aurora was visible; and, in the same three
  months of 1853-1854, there were 1837 hourly observations, at 616
 of which the Aurora was seen. There were therefore in the six
  months      3625 hourly observations,       at 1077 of which the Aurora was
  seen contemporaneously, and at 2548 it was either not present or                    1
  obscured by clouds: the presence of the Aurora was thus recorded                    1
  at between one-third and one-fourth of the hours of observation. Or                 .
  possibly     the frequency     of its appearance may be more easily judged
  of by stating, that during these six months the Aurora was seen on
  six days out of every seven
       The record thus furnished by Capt. Maguire has enabled the author
  to treat the Aurora, for the <U+FB01>rst time, in the same way as the corre
   sponding and connected phenomena of the magnetic disturbances are
   treated, viz. by distributing its recorded appearances into the several
   hours of their occurrence. A table, in which the particulars of this
   distribution are contained, shows that l A-M. is the hour of their most
   frequent occurrence        at  Point Barrow, there having been 102 recorded
                                          at that hour. From 11 A.M. to 3 P.M.

    is the epoch of minimum, not a single instance of Aurora at any of
              hours being recorded in the same six months.            The increase
    those
