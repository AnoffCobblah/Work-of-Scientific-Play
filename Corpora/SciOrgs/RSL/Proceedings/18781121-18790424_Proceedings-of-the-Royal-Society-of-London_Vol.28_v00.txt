desirable, each reflection at the mirror, AB, adding 26 to the deflection
of the ray.      I have, for instance, employed three reflections from the
beam-mirror, so multiplying the deflection six times. In this case,
one division of my scale, at the distance at which it was placed from
the beam, corresponded to a deflection of 7" in the beam, and this
could be subdivided to tenths by the eye. The only limit to the
multiplication arises from the imperfection of the mirrors and the
decrease in the illumination of the successive reflections.”
    The chair of the observer is placed on a raised platform, and a small
table rising from the platform and free from the frame on which the
instruments rest, is between the observer and the telescope. On this
he can rest his note-book during an experiment.           As the differences of
weight observed are sometimes exceedingly minute, the balance is made
very sensitive—usually vibrating in periods between 30" and 50". The
value of a division of the scale cannot be determined by adding known
small weights to one pan, as the deflection would usually be too great.
Any approach of the observer to the case causes great disturbances, so
that the ordinary method of moving a rider an observed distance
along     the   beam   is inapplicable.    In some experiments made last
year    I  calculated   the force equivalent to the small differences in
weight, in absolute measure, by observing the actual angular deflec
tion and the time of vibration. With a knowledge of the moment
of inertia of the beam and treating it as a case of small oscillations,
 it was possible to calculate the value of the scale. But the observa
tions and subsequent calculations were so complicated that the
following method of employing riders was ultimately adopted.
    A small bridge about an inch long (fig. II, 1) is fitted on to the beam.
The sides of the bridge are prolonged about half an inch above the
   * This   method was used in the seventh and eighth series here recorded.    Two
reflections from the beam mirror were employed, giving four times the actual deflec
tion.

over round to the extreme right, when A will be just over and nearly
touching the scale pan. By continuing the motion slightly A will be
gently deposited on the pan, and the side rod will move slightly down
leaving the weight quite free. On the scale pan are four pins, turned
slightly outwards, acting as guides for the small pan, and ensuring
that it shall always come into the same position. The wheels and
pinions are of such a size that two revolutions of the rod just suffice
to change one weight for the other.
   It will be seen that all the manipulation required from the observer
during a series of weighings is the simple turning of three rods, which
are prolonged out of the balance case to where he is stationed at the
telescope.   By turning one of these he can change the position of the
rider on the beam by a known amount, and so find the value of his
scale. By turning a second he clamps the scale pan, and so steadies
the balance while the weights are changed by turning a third rod. I
have made this arrangement not only because it seems as simple as
possible to secure the end required, but also because it seemed more
                                                     I
applicable to a vacuum balance (with which hope ultimately to test
it).

of the apparatus, and in the planning of many of its details.

   After the counterpoise has been adjusted so that the beam swings
nearly about its horizontal position, the frame is lowered so that the
balance is ready for use.   The pan is then clamped and the balance is
left to come to a nearly  permanent  state of flexure if possible, some
times for the night or even longer. The lamp is lighted usually half
an-hour or more before beginning to observe, so that its effect on the
balance may attain a more or less steady state.  It is necessary also
to wait some time after coming into the room, for the opening of the
door will always cause a considerable and immediate deflection of the
beam.  When a sufficient time has elapsed, the observations are com
                   *
menced with a determination of the value of one scale division by
means of the riders.  The three extremities of two successive oscilla
tions are observed with one of the riders resting on the beam. These
are then combined as follows :-The mean of the first and third is
taken, and the mean again of this and the second, this constituting the
“resting point,” that   is,

the rider on the beam being the right hand one denoted by R,
column 1. The balance is the clamped, and the other rider is brought
on to the beam while the first is taken up. The resting point is again
 observed.            I
               In No. it was 270-05. The balance is again clamped,
and the first rider again brought on the beam, and in unclamping the
resting point again observed. In the same weighing it was 296.75.
These three are sufficient to give one determination of the deflection
due to the transference of a rider.    This will be the difference between
the second resting point and the mean of the first and third.               For
instance,

   This process is continued, the resting points being combined in threes
till several values of the deflection due to the rider have been obtained,
and the mean of these is taken as the true value.          This plan of com
bining the resting points requires that the observations should be
taken at nearly equal intervals.      After a  little practice it will always
take the observer about the same time to go through the same opera
tions of clamping, changing the riders, unclamping, clamping again to
lessen the vibrations about the new resting point, and then beginning
                   I
to observe, and have considered that this was a sufficiently            correct
method of timing the observations.
   When a series has    been taken it will at once be seen whether they
were    begun  too soon after entering the room, or whether any irregular
disturbing force has acted. For instance, in weighing No. II, determi
nation of one scale division, the first resting point is so much lower
than the succeeding with the same rider that evidently the balance was
still affected by my entrance into the room. It was, therefore, rejected.
Again, in weighing No.     III determination of the difference between the
weights, the fourth resting point was much lower than the others with
the same weight in the pan. The resting points, when the other
weight was in the pan, showed no similar sudden drop of such magni
tude. This observation was, therefore, rejected as being affected by
some irregular disturbance.
   When the value of the deflection is determined, the value of one
scale division is at once found by dividing 3282 mgm. by the number
of    divisions of the deflection, since the charge of the sides is
equivalent to the addition of 3282 mgm. to one pan.
    The determination of the difference between the weights is then
begun. This is carried on in a precisely similar manner, the only
difference being, that the rod changing the weights is now turned
round in place of the rod changing the riders.         I have usually taken a
greater number of observations of the difference between the weights
than of the deflection due to the riders, as the former is somewhat
more irregular than the latter.        This irregularity    I  believe to arise

from slight differences of temperature of the two weights, and perhaps
from air currents caused by their motion inside the case. They do
not seem to be due to any fault in the clamping arrangement, since
that is employed equally in both, and the changing of the weights, if
effected gently, does not move the beam at all.
   When the deflection has been determined, it is multiplied by the
number of milligrammes corresponding to one scale division, and this,
of course, gives the difference between the weights. I have inter
changed the weights in the two pans X and Y, between the series of
weighings, in order to make the experiments like those conducted in
the weighings for the standard pound. But my object has not been
to show at           all

12                       Mr.   J.   H. Poynting               on a method           of             [Nov. 21,
On the Employment of the Balance to determine the Mean Density of the
                                                 Earth.
     In the Cavendish experiment, the attraction of a large sphere of
lead of known mass and dimensions upon another smaller sphere also
of known mass and dimensions, is measured when the two are an
observed distance apart.  Comparing this attraction with the weight
of the small sphere—that  is the attraction of the earth upon it—and
knowing the dimensions of the earth, we can deduce the mass of the
earth in terms of the mass of the large lead sphere, and so obtain its
mean density.   The torsion balance, which was invented for the pur
pose by Mitchell, the original contriver of the experiment, has hitherto
been used to determine the force exerted by the mass upon the small
sphere.     In the arrangement here described,   have replaced the              I
torsion balance by the ordinary balance, and have so been able to
compare the attraction of a lead sphere with that of the earth upon
the same mass somewhat more directly.    The results which     have                                   I
obtained have no value in themselves, but they serve as an example of
the employment of the balance for more delicate work than any which
it has as yet been supposed able to perform.
   The method is shortly this:—A lead weight (called “the weight”)
weighing 452.92 grns. (nearly 1 lb.) hangs down by a fine wire from
one arm of a balance, from which the pan has been removed at a
distance of about six feet below    and          it,
                                            accurately counterpoised

introduced directly under the hanging weight.     The attraction    this                                of
mass increases the weight slightly and the beam        deflected through            is
an angle which       observed. The value

centims. in diameter and is gilded.     The mass is a sphere of an alloy
of lead and    antimony.     It was cast with a “head ” on and then
accurately turned.      Its vertical diameter is 30:477 centims. (about
1 foot).   The specific gravity of a specimen of the metal was found
to be 10422.      Its weight given by a weighing machine is 340 lbs.
about, and this agrees very nearly with the weight calculated from the
specific gravity.              I
                       am obliged to accept this as the true weight pro
visionally, until it is found more correctly by the large balance referred
to above and now being constructed.
   This mass (fig. I, M) is placed in a shallow wood cup at one end of a
2-inch plank, 8 inches wide and 6 feet 11 inches long, mounted on four
flanged brass wheels, and serving as a carriage for it (fig. I). A
plank about 12 feet long nailed to the floor in a direction perpendicular
to the beam of the balance, as shown in fig. I, pp, acts as a railway for
the carriage, and a firm stop at each end prevents the carriage from
running off the rail. The distance between the stops is rather less than
twice the length of the carriage, and the weights hangs down from the
balance exactly midway between the stops. The mass is placed on the
carriage so that it is exactly under the weight when the carriage is at
one end of its excursion against one of the stops. An empty cup

the mass in its two positions is found in exactly the manner in which
the difference between two weights is found, except that now when three
successive extremities of oscillations have been observed for a resting
point the mass is moved from one position to the other where the weights
were changed in the former experiments, the clamp not being brought
into action. The second extremity of the oscillation which is proceed
ing while the mass is moved, is observed as the first of the next three.
When nine or more resting points have been observed they are com
bined in threes, and the mean of the resulting values of the deflection
n is used in the subsequent calculation.
   This deflection is, of course, less than that which would be observed
were there no attraction on the counterpoise, and were the out position
of the mass at an infinite distance. To find the factor by which the        f
deflection n due to the change of position of the mass must be multi
plied in order to reduce it to the deflection which would be observed
under these conditions, let AB be equal and parallel to the beam
of the balance at the level of the counterpoise of which B is the
centre. Let C be the centre of the weight, D that of the mass in                       its

   The resulting mean value of the mean density of the earth is 5.69.
   If the eleven determinations be supposed to have equal weight, the
probable error of their value is 0.15.
   The various determinations differ very much among themselves, but
they seem to me sufficiently close to justify the hope that with a large
balance and a large weight, which will not be so easily affected by air
currents, and with greater precautions to prevent those air currents, a
good determination of the mean density of the earth may ultimately
 be obtained by this method.

                                  (Abstract.)
     In this part, with which  the research closes, the author first examines
 the action of thin mica screens fixed on the fly of an ordinary radio
 meter, in modifying the movements.          It is found that when a disk
 of thin clear mica is attached 1 millim. in front of the blacked side of
 the vanes of an ordinary radiometer, the fly moves negatively, the
 black side approaching instead of retreating from the light. When
 a thin mica disk is fixed on each side of the vanes of a radiometer,
 the result is an almost total loss of sensitiveness.
     In order to examine the action of screens still further an instru
  ment is described having the screens movable, and working on a pivot
  independent of the one carrying the fly, so that the screens can move
  freely and come close either to the black or to the white surfaces of the
  disks.   By gentle tapping the screens can be brought within 2 millims.
  of the black surfaces.        A candle is now brought near, shaded so
  that the  light  has to pass through  one of the clear disks and fall on
  the black surface.      The black side immediately retreats, the clear
  disk remaining stationary for a moment and then approaching the
  light. If the candle is allowed to shine on the plain side of the black
  disk, no immediate movement takes place. Very soon, however, both
  disks move in the same direction away from the candle, the speed of
  the clear disk gradually increasing over that of the blacked disk.
                                                                   D 2

   Instead of allowing the clear screens to freely move on a pivot, an
instrument was made in which the screens could be fixed beforehand
in any desired position in respect to the blacked disks. It was then
found that with the screens close to the blacked sides of the vanes
the fly rotates very slowly in the negative direction, stopping
altogether when the candle is moved five or six inches off. With
the screens 1 millim. from the black surface the direction is negative
and the speed   at its maximum.   When the screens and disks are
7 millims,  apart a position of neutrality is attained, no movement
taking place. When the distance is further increased, positive rota
tion commences, which gets stronger as the screens approach the
bright sides of the disks, where the positive rotation is at maxi                                                its
mum.    The author adduces reasons for considering that the negative
rotations here observed are caused    the warming up         by

negative; the speed of rotation is greater as the vanes are further
removed from this neutral position on either side.    The position
of this neutral point varies with the   degree of exhaustion;  thus
at 12 M, the screens must be 3 millims, from the convex side; at
 18        M
        they must be 13 millims. from the convex side. The higher
the exhaustion the greater the distance which must separate the convex
side of the hemi-cylinders and the screens.
   The author gives explanations of these phenomena, based on the
following already ascertained facts:—When thin aluminium vanes are
exposed to light the metal rises in temperature and becomes equally.
warm throughout, and a layer of molecular pressure is generated on
its surface. The thickness of this layer of pressure, or the length of
the lines of force of repulsion, varies with the degree of exhaustion,
being longer as the exhaustion increases. The lines of force appear to
radiate from the metal in a direction normal to its surface. The force
of repulsion is also greater the closer the repelled body is to the
generating or driving surface, and the force diminishes rapidly as
the distance increases, according to a law which does not appear to
be that of “inverse squares.” Diagrams are given illustrating the
author's explanation, based on the above data.
   An apparatus is next described not differing in principle from the
last, but having, in addition to the aluminium hemi-cylinder and
movable mica screen, a small rotating                          fly

was hoped that some of the more obscure phenomena shown by the
deep cups with movable screens in front (referred to above) might be
intensified if set in action by a hot wire.   Several kinds of apparatus
and  experiments    with them are  described, but the results are too com
plicated  to be given in abstract.      One experiment proves that the
direction of pressure is not wholly   normal to the surface on which it
is generated, but that some of it is tangential.
   The author then describes the turbine radiometer, early specimens
of which were exhibited before the Royal Society on April 5, 1876.

described in detail. Many different forms of instrument for effecting
this rotation are described, and their mode of action explained.
  The reacting inner   surface of the envelope being thus proved to be
essential to the rotation of the fly, other instruments were made in
which this necessary reaction is obtained in a more direct manner.
In one, the radiometer is furnished with a fly carrying four flat
aluminium vanes, polished on both sides. Three vertical partitions
of thin clear mica are fixed in the bulb, with their planes not passing
through the axis of rotation, but inclined to                       it,
                                                     thus throwing the
obliquity off the fly         the case, and giving three fixed planes for

the reaction     take place against.
                   to                      Candles arranged symmetrically
round the bulb make the       fly rotate  rapidly against the edges      the        of
inclined planes.  Breathing    gently          on
                                           the bulb gives negative rotation.
A  hot glass shade inverted over the instrument causes strong negative
rotation, changing      positive
                             to         on
                                      cooling.   When the fly     furnished    is
with clear mica         or
                      with silver flake mica     vanes, the same results are
obtained      as
              when aluminium vanes are employed.           The principal
action   produced
         is        by  dark heat  warming  the  bulb, screens, and vanes.

gauge approaches barometric height, the molecular pressure tends to
become uniform through considerable distances, the mean path of the
molecules now being comparable with the greatest distance separating
the surfaces between which they act.
     A similar apparatus to the one in which the last experiments were
tried was used to measure the action at pressures at and approaching
atmospheric. At pressures between atmospheric and 210 millims, the
first action is very faint repulsion, immediately followed by strong
attraction.        The attraction then begins to decline, until at 15 millims.
pressure      it disappears.       At the same time the repulsion, which begins
 to be apparent at 250 millims., increases as the attraction diminishes.
 The author considers that the attraction is the result of air-currents,
 caused by the permanent heating of the surface in front of the move
 able disk.
     The paper concludes with experiments undertaken to measure the
 amount of repulsion, using a horizontal torsion balance,” on the prin
 ciple of Ritchie's, in which the force of repulsion is balanced by the
 torsion of a fine glass fibre. The pan of the balance is a clear mica disk,
  and a similar disk is fastened to the tube in which the beam oscillates.
  This fixed disk is lampblacked on the upper side, and beneath is a spiral
  of platinum wire, connected with terminals sealed through the side of
  the tube. When the spiral is ignited by a constant electric current, the
  blacked mica disk fixed above it becomes heated, and the molecular
  pressure     thereby generated between it and the mica pan causes the
  latter to rise. The glass thread attached to the beam is thus twisted,
  and by means of a graduated circle the number of degrees through
  which the thread has to be turned in order to bring the beam back to
  equilibrium is noted. This gives a measurement of the pressure exerted,
  in torsional    degrees, and these are converted       into grains by ascertaining
  how many torsional degrees correspond to a known weight.                      A ray of
   light reflected from a mirror in the centre of the beam is used as an
   index, being brought back to zero at each experiment.                    The author
   gives   in a table, and also shows in the form of a curve, the results ob
   tained with this apparatus, giving the force of molecular pressure in
   grains weight at exhaustions varying between 2,237 and 0.7 millionths
    of an atmosphere.

the exception of our former President, the venerable Sir E. Sabine, of that
celebrated band of Arctic voyagers, which during the early part of the
century added so much to our renown as navigators and discoverers.       Sir
George was further the companion of Franklin and Richardson in that
overland journey to the American Polar Sea, in which human endur
ance was tried to the uttermost compatible with human existence, as
is related by two of the party in that modest but thrilling narrative
which will ever hold a unique place in the annals of geographical dis
covery. Of our Indian explorers four have been taken away, namely,
Major-General Sir Andrew Waugh, for many years Director of the
Great Trigonometrical Survey of India; and shortly afterwards            his
friend, Col. Montgomerie; Dr. Oldham, for a quarter of a century
the Director of the Geological Society of India; and Dr. Thomas
Thomson,     my fellow-traveller in the Himalaya, whose report of ex
plorations    in Western Tibet contains the first connected account of
the   physical  and natural features of that remote and difficult country.
Lieut.-General Cameron survived but for one year our late Fellow,
Sir Henry James, his predecessor in the Direction of the Ordnance
Survey of Great Britain. In the Rev. James Booth we have lost
a mathematician       of high attainments.    The Rev. W. B. Clarke, of
New South Wales, was the author of many papers on the Meteorology
and Geology of the Cape of Good Hope, Australia, and the Pacific.
The Rev. R. Main, Director of the Radcliffe Observatory, was for
nearly half a century an indefatigable observer.      Lastly, Earl Russell,
the   distinguished   statesman,  and the earnest advocate,  whether in the
 Government or in Parliament, of every measure for the promotion of
scientific inquiry. He it was who, when Prime Minister in 1849, wrote
to the then Earl of Rosse, President of the Society, offering to place
 .#1,000 (now known as the Government Grant) on the annual votes of
 Parliament, if the Council would undertake to apportion that sum
among scientific workers requiring aid in their researches.
    Of Foreign Fellows our losses are a great Chemist in Becquerel, of
 Paris, whose election took place upwards of forty years ago; a great
 Physiologist in Claude Bernard, also of Paris; the father of Mycology,
 and for long the patriarch of Scandinavian Botanists, Elias Fries;
 a most distinguished Physicist and the recipient of both a Rumford
 and Copley medal in Regnault; a veteran Anatomist in Weber; and
 in Secchi, of Rome, an Astronomer of astonishing activity, the author
 of more than three hundred separate contributions         to the science of
 which he was so great an ornament.
    In matters of Finance      I  may with satisfaction   refer you to our
 Treasurer's Balance Sheets.
    It will be  in your recollection that Mr. T. J. Phillips Jodrell placed
 in  1874 a  sum of £6,000 at the disposal of the Society, with the view

       Fee, and for reducing their Annual Contribution, be formed into
       one fund.
          2.—That the Entrance Fee for ordinary Fellows be henceforth
       abolished;  and that the Annual Contribution for ordinary Fellows
       hereafter elected be £3 (three pounds).     Also, that the income of
       the Fund above-mentioned be applied, so far as is requisite, to
       make up the loss to the Society arising from these remissions and
       reductions.
           3.—That the account of this Fund be kept separate; and that
       the annual surplus of income, after providing for the remission
       and reduction above recommended, be re-invested, until the in
       come from the Fund reaches £600. So soon as the annual income
                                                                  year, after
       reaches this amount, any surplus of income in any
       providing for the remission and reduction above-mentioned, shall
       be available, in the first instance, in aid of publication and for
       the promotion of research.
    A   list of subscribers to this Fund will be placed in the hands of
 every Fellow, with the information that it will be kept open for future
 contributions, in the interests of research and of the Society's publica
 tions.    I hope that it will be largely and speedily augmented, and that
 it may eventually reach an amount which will provide us with the
 means of accomplishing as much as is effected
                                                        by the Government
 Fund, upon our own sole and undivided responsibility.            I  must not
 conclude my notice of this movement without a mention        of those  whose
 encouragement and liberality have most largely promoted         it;  and first

the number of members of the solar system by Professor Asaph Hall's
discovery of the satellites of Mars; and more recently, Professor
Watson has announced his detection of planetary bodies within the
orbit of Mercury, during the Solar Eclipse which was visible in
America.
    In 1876 Schmidt recorded an outburst of light in a star in Cygnus,
which showed a continuous spectrum containing bright lines similar
to those of the remarkable star of 1866. As the star waned the
continuous spectrum and bright lines faded, all but one bright line in
the green, giving the object the spectroscopic appearance of a small
gaseous nebula.
    Great progress   has been made during the last five years at Green
wich in the method of determining the motions of the heavenly
bodies by the displacement of the lines in their spectra, as first
successfully accomplished by Mr. Huggins in 1868. Not only do
the results obtained by the stars observed at Greenwich              agree
with those of Mr. Huggins, as satisfactorily as can be expected
in so delicate an investigation, but the motions of seventeen more have
been determined; while the trustworthiness of the method has been
shown by the agreement of the values for the rotation of the sun and
the motions of Venus, with the known movements of these bodies.
Mr. Huggins has also obtained photographs of the spectra of some of
the brighter stars, which give well defined lines in the violet and ultra
violet parts of the spectrum.       These spectra have already shown
alterations in the lines common to them and the sun, which are of
much interest.
    In Solar Physics, which afford remarkable evidence of Mr. Lockyer's
energetic labours in this country and Mr. Janssen's in France,     I  must
mention our Foreign Member's wonderful photographs of the sun,
 wherein the minutest of the constant changes in the granulations
exhibited on its surface (and which vary in size from To of a second
to 3 or 4 seconds) can be studied in future from hour to hour and day
 to day; as can also their different behaviour at different periods of
the occurrence of sun-spots.
    Before dismissing this fruitful field of research,  I must allude to
Mr.   Lockyer's  discovery of carbon in the   sun;  and to his announced
 but not yet published observations on the changes and modifications
 of spectra under different conditions, some of which he even regards
as indicating the breaking up of the atoms of bodies hitherto re
 garded as elementary.
    Some important investigations on the Electric Discharge have been
 communicated to the Society by Messrs. De La Rue and Müller, and
by Mr. Spottiswoode.      These, prosecuted by different means, tend to
 limit the possible causes of the stratification observed in discharges
 through vacuum tubes. They also point to the conclusion that this

phenomenon is in a great measure due to motions among the mole
cules of the residual gas, which themselves becomè vehicles for the
transmission' of Electricity through the tube.           It is well known that
gases at atmospheric pressure offer great resistance         to the passage of
Electricity; and that this resistance diminishes (to           a certain  limit,
different for different gases) with the pressure. And the researches
in question appear to show that the discharge, manifestly disruptive
at the higher pressures, is really also disruptive even at pressures when
stratification takes place.       The period of these discontinuous dis
charges has not yet been the subject of measurement, but it must, in
any case, be extremely rapid.
    The remarkable experiments which have resulted in the liquefaction
of the gases hitherto regarded as permanent will be noticed presently
when    I deliver to their authors the medals they so richly deserve.
    Under the auspices of the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House,
and as their scientific adviser, Professor Tyndall has conducted an
investigation on the acoustic properties of the atmosphere.                 The
instruments      employed  included steam   whistles, trumpets,   steam  syrens,
and guns.        The propagation of sound through fog was proved to
depend not upon the suspended aqueous particles, but upon the con
dition of the sustaining air. And as air of great homogeneity is the
usual associate of fog, such a medium is often astonishingly transparent
to sound.       Hail, rain, snow, and ordinary misty weather, were also
proved to offer no sensible obstruction to the passage of sound. Every
phenomenon observed upon the large scale was afterwards repro
duced experimentally.         Clouds, fumes, and artificial showers of rain,
hail, and snow were proved quite ineffectual to stop the sound, so long
as the air was homogeneous, while the introduction of a couple of
burners into a space filled with acoustically transparent air soon
rendered     it impervious to the waves of sound. As long as the con
tinuity of the air in their interstices was preserved, the sound-waves
passed freely through silk, flannel, green baize, even through masses
 of hard felt half an inch in thickness, the same sound-waves being
 intercepted by goldbeater's skin.          A cambric handkerchief which,
 when dry, offered no impediment to their passage, when dipped into
 water became an impassable barrier to the sound-waves.
    Echoes of extraordinary         intensity were sent back from non
 homogeneous transparent air; while similar echoes were afterwards
 obtained from the air of the laboratory, rendered non-homogeneous
 by artificial means. Detached masses of non-homogeneous air often
 drift through the atmosphere, as clouds pass over the face of the
 sky.    This has been proved by the fluctuations observed with bells
 having their clappers adjusted mechanically, so as to give a uniform
 stroke.    The fluctuations occur only on certain days; they occur when
 care has been taken to perfectly damp the bell between every two suc

ceeding strokes; and they also occur when the direction of the sound is
at right angles to that of the wind.     Numerous observations were also
made on the influence of the wind, the results obtained by previous
observers being thereby confirmed. From his own observations, as well
as from the antecedent ones of Mr. Alexander Beazeley and Professor
 Osborne Reynolds, Professor Tyndall concludes that the explanation of
 this phenomenon given by Professor Stokes is the true one.
     Turning now to biological branches of Science,     I find that the dis
 coveries and researches of the past five years in this department also
 are far in advance of those of any previous period of equal length.
 The “Challenger” Expedition was, in point of the magnitude of the
 undertaking and completeness of its equipment, the rival of that for
 observing the Transit of Venus. Its general results, as far as hitherto
 made known, have been dwelt upon in my previous addresses, and
 the publication of them in detail is being rapidly pushed forward.
  Some very important papers by Mr. Moseley on the Corals collected
 on the voyage have indeed been published in our “Transactions”
 with admirable illustrations by himself.
     To the Botanist and Geologist no subject has a greater interest than
 that of the conditions under which the successive Floras, which in
 habited the polar area, existed and were successively dispersed over
 lower latitudes previous to their extinction, some in toto and over the
 whole globe, while others, though extinct in the regions where they once
 flourished, exist now only in lower latitudes under identical or under
 representative forms. It is only during the last few years that, thanks to
 the labours of those engaged in systematic Botany in tracing accurately
 the directions of migrations of existing genera and species, and in
 determining the affinities of the extinct ones, and of Palaeontologists
 in referring the latter to their respective geological horizons, that
 any material advance has been made towards a knowledge of the
 origin and distribution of earlier and later Floras.        I cannot better
 illustrate the condition of this   inquiry than by calling   your attention
 to two publications     on the subject, which have appeared within the
 last few months.
     As  a contribution to the principles of Geographical Botany, Count
 Gaston de Saporta's essay, entitled “L'Ancienne Végétation Polaire’
 (which appeared in the “Comptes Rendus” of the French Inter
national Geographical Congress) is a very suggestive one, and having
regard especially to its author's eminence as a geologist and palaeonto
logist, is sure to command attentive study. Although it may be argued
that neither is solar nor terrestrial physics, nor Geology, nor Palaeonto
logy in a sufficiently advanced condition to warrant the acceptation
as fully established truths of all the conclusions therein advanced, still
the array of facts adduced in evidence of these conclusions is very im     -

posing, while the ability and adroitness with which they are brought
to bear on the subject are almost worthy of the great French genius
whose speculations form the starting-point of the theory, which is
that life appeared first in the northern circumpolar area of the globe,
and that this was the birthplace                            of the first and of                all   subsequent
Floras.
I    should premise that Count Saporta professedly bases his specula
tions upon the labours       his friend, Professor Heer, whose reasonings

the termination     the Azoic period coincided with

tion may be approximately drawn, its northern must have extended to
the Pole itself.
    I   pass over   Saporta's speculations regarding the initial condi
tions of terrestrial   life, which followed upon the emergence of the
earlier stratified rocks from the Polar Ocean, and proceed to his dis
cussion of the climate of the carboniferous epoch as indicated by the
characters of its vegetation, and of the conditions under which alone
he conceives this can have flourished in latitudes now continuously
deprived of solar light throughout many months of the year.      In the
first place, he accepts Heer's conclusions (founded on the presence of
a tree-fern in the coal measures specifically similar to an existing
tropical one), that the climate was warm, moist, and equable, and
 continuously so over the whole globe, without distinction of latitude.
 This leads him to ask whether, when the polar regions were inhabited
 by the same species as Europe itself, they could have been exposed to
conditions which turned their summers into a day of many months'
duration, and their winters into a night of proportional length ?
   A temperature so equable throughout the year as to favour a rich
growth of Cryptogamic plants, appears, he says, to be at first sight
incompatible with such alternating conditions as a winter of one long
night and a summer of one long day; but equability, even in high
latitudes, may be produced by the effect of fogs due to southerly
warm oceanic currents, such as bathe the Orkneys and even Bear
Island (in lat. 75° N.), and render their summers cool and winters
mild. To the direct effects of these he would add the action of such
fogs in obstructing terrestrial radiation, and hence preventing the evil
effects which its cold would otherwise induce; and he would further
efface the existing conditions of a long winter darkness by the hypo
thesis that the solar light was not, during the formation of the coal,
distributed over the globe as it now                is,

   Lastly, the advent of the Miocene period, in the polar area, was
accompanied with the production of a profusion of genera, the majority
of which have existing representatives which must now be sought in a
latitude 40° farther south, and to which they were driven by the
advent and advance of the glacial cold; and here Count Saporta’s
conclusions accord with those of Professor A. Gray, who first showed,
now twenty years ago, that the representatives of the elements of the
United States Flora previously inhabited high northern latitudes, from
which they were driven south during the Glacial period.
   Perhaps the most novel idea in Count Saporta's Essay is that of the
diffused sunlight which (with a densely clouded atmosphere), the
author assumes to have been operative in reducing the contrast
between the polar summers and winters.            If it be accepted it at
once   disposes   of the   difficulty of  admitting    that evergreen trees
survived a   long   polar winter of total  darkness,  and a summer of con
stant stimulation by bright sunlight; and            further,            if,

Research.” Mr. Thiselton Dyer's order of procedure is the reverse
of Count Saporta's, and his method entirely different. He first gives
a very clear outline of the distribution of the principal existing
Floras of the continents and islands of the globe, their composition,
and their relations to one another, and to those of previous geological
epochs.     He then discusses the views of botanists respecting their
origin and distinctive characters, and availing himself of such of their
hypotheses as he thinks tenable, correlates these with those of
palaeontologists, and arrives at the conclusion “That the northern
hemisphere has always played the most important part in the evolution
and distribution of new vegetable types, or in other words, that a
greater number of plants has migrated from north to south than in the
reverse direction, and that all the great assemblages of plants which
we call Floras, seem to admit of being traced back at some time in
their history to the northern hemisphere.” This amount of accordance
between the results of naturalists working wholly independently, from
entirely different stand-points, and employing almost opposite methods,
cannot but be considered as very satisfactory.           will conclude by   I
 observing that there is a certain analogy between two very salient
 points which are well brought out by these authors respectively. Count
 Saporta, looking to the past, makes it appear that the fact of the
 several Floras which have flourished on the globe being successively
 both more localised and more specialised, is the natural result of con
 ditions to which it is assumed our globe has been successively sub
 jected. Mr. Dyer, looking to the present, makes it appear that the
 several Floras now existing on the globe are, in point of affinity and
 specialisation, the natural results of the conditions to which they must
 have been subjected during recent geological time on continents and
 islands with the configuration of those of our globe.
    The modern       development  of botanical science, being that which
occupies my own attention, is naturally that on which             might feel          I

Hooke demonstrated its cellular structure, and by an interesting coin
cidence he was one of the first to investigate, at the request, indeed,
of the founder of the Society, Charles II, the movements of the sensi.
tive plant Mimosa pudica—one of a class of phenomena which is still
occupying the attention of more than one of our Fellows.        In attribut
ing the loss of turgescence, which is the cause of the collapse of the
petiole and subordinate portions of the compound leaf which it supports,
to the escape of a subtle humour, he to some extent foreshadowed the
modern view which attributes the collapse of the cells to the escape of
water by some mechanism far from clearly understood—whether            from
the cell-cavities, or from the cell-walls into the intercellular spaces.
   Hooke having shown the way, Nehemiah Grew, who was also
Secretary of the Royal Society, and Marcello Malpighi, Professor of
Medicine in the University of Bologna, were not slow to follow                                                     it.
Almost simultaneously (1671-3) the researches          these two indefati           of
gable students were presented       the Royal Society, and the publication

to give one example, Grew figured and described                                          in   several different

    been  recently paid with the most interesting results.   These well
    known structures, first observed by Ferdinand Bauer    the beginning                                  at
    of the century (1802), were only accurately described thirty years
    later by Robert Brown (1833).        Up     the present time their         to
    function has been extremely obscure. The beautiful investigations
    of   Strasburger (1875) have led him       the conclusion that the         to

actual    detail,  and of which it must be remarked that while the
interest and      beauty  of the researches are beyond question, caution
must be exercised in accepting the mechanical speculations by which
Strasburger attempts to explain them. He has himself shown that
cell-division presents the same phenomena in the animal kingdom; a
result which has been confirmed by numerous observers, amongst
whom     I may content    myself with mentioning one of our own Society,
Mr. F. Balfour.       Strasburger  further points out that this affords an
argument for the community of descent in animal and vegetable cells;
he regards free cell-division as derivable from ordinary cell-division
by the suppression of certain stages.
   Turning now to the discoveries made during the last five years in
Physiological Botany, we find that no one has advanced this subject so
greatly as Mr. Darwin. In 1875 was published his work on Insectivo
rous Plants, in which he ascertained the fact that a number of species
having elaborate structures adapted for the capture of insects, utilized
the nitrogenous matter which these contain as food. The most impor
tant principle established in the course of these researches was, that
such plants as Drosera, Dionaba, Pinguicula, secrete a digestive fluid,
which has led through Gorup Bezanez's investigations on the ferment
in germinating seeds, to a recognition of the active agency of ferments
in the transmission of food-material, which marks a great advance in
our knowledge of the general Physiology of Nutrition.
    The extreme sensitiveness of the glands of Drosera to mechanical
and chemical stimulus (especially to phosphate of ammonia), the
directive power of its tentacles, depending upon the accurate trans
mission of motor impulses, and the “reflex” excitation of secretion
in the glands, were all discoveries of the most suggestive nature in
connexion with the subject of the irritability and movements of plants.
The phenomenon of the aggregation of the protoplasmic cell-contents
in the tentacles of Drosera is a discovery of a highly remarkable
nature, though not yet thoroughly understood.           Lastly, Mr. Frank
Darwin, following his father's footsteps, as it were crowned the edifice
by showing to what an extent insectivorous        plants do profit by nitro
genous matter supplied to their leaves.
    In close relation to these researches are those, also by Mr. Darwin,
on the structure and functions of the bladder of Utricularia, which he
has shown to have the power of absorbing decaying animal matter;
and those of Mr. Frank Darwin on contractile filaments of extra
ordinary tenuity attached to the glands on the inner surface of the
cups formed by the connate bases of the leaves of the Teasel, which
filaments exhibit motions suggesting a protoplasmic origin. It is to be
 hoped that their discoverer will pursue his investigations into these
 curious bodies, whose origin and real nature in relation to the plant
 and its functions are involved in obscurity.

   The subject of the cross-fertilization of plants, which though a long
Known phenomenon, first become a fruitful scientific study in Mr.
Darwin's now classical work “On the various contrivances by which
Orchids are fertilized,” has within the last few years made rapid ad
vance under its author's hand. The extreme importance of avoiding
self-fertilization might indeed be inferred from the prevalence in
flowers of elaborate contrivances for preventing it; but it remained to
be shown that direct benefit attended cross-fertilization, and this has
now been proved by an elaborate series of experiments, the results of
which are not only that both increased fertility or greater vigour of
constitution attend cross-fertilization, but that the opposite effects
attend self-fertilization. In the course of these experiments it became
evident that the good effects of the cross do not depend on the mere
fact of the parents being different individuals, for when these were
grown together and under the same conditions, no advantage was
gained by the progeny; but when grown under different conditions a
manifest advantage was gained. As instancés, if plants of Ipomaea
and Mimulus, which had been self-fertilized for seven previous gene
rations, were kept together and then intercrossed, their offspring did
not profit in the least; whereas, when the parent plants were grown
under different conditions, a remarkably         vigorous offspring was
obtained.
   Mr. Darwin's last work, “On the different forms of Flowers,”
though professedly a reprint of his paper on dimorphic plants, pub
lished by the Linnaean Society, contains many additions and new
matter of great importance concerning the behaviour of polygamous
plants, and on Cleistogamic flowers. Among other points of great
interest is the establishment of very close analogies between the pheno
mena attending the illegitimate union of trimorphic plants, and the
results of crosses between distinct species, the sterile offspring of the
crosses of the same species exhibiting the closest resemblance to the
sterile hybrids obtained by crossing distinct species; while a whole
series of generalizations, founded on the results of the one series of
experiments, are closely paralleled by those founded on the other.
The bearing of this analogy on the origin of species is obviously
important.
   Besides these investigations, Mr. Darwin has produced within the last
five years second editions of his volume on the Fertilization of Orchids,
and on the Habits and Movements of Climbing Plants; as also of his
early works on Coral Reefs, and Geological Observations in South
America; all of them abounding in new matter.
   Of special interest to myself, as having been conducted in the
Jodrell Laboratory at Kew, are Dr. Burdon Sanderson's             investi
gations    on the exceptional property possessed by the leaves and
other   organs of some plants which exhibit definite movements in

6()                        Anniversary Meeting.                   [Nov.30,
response    to  mechanical,   chemical,   or electric stimuli.     In 1873,
Dr. Sanderson showed us in this      meeting  room,  that the closing of the
laminae of the leaf of Dionaba is preceded by a preliminary state of
excitement, and is attended with a change in the electric conditions of
the leaf; and this so closely resembled the change which attends the
excitation of the excitable tissues of animals, that he did not hesitate
to identify the two phenomena.
    This remarkable discovery immediately        directed the attention of
two German observers to the electromotive properties of plants, one,
Dr. Kunkel, in the Laboratory of Professor Sachs; the other Pro
fessor Munk, in that of the University of Berlin.
    Professor Munk, whose researches are of much the greater scope
and importance, took as his point of departure Dr. Burdon Sanderson's
 discovery.    The leading conclusion to which he arrived was, that in
Dionaba each    of the oblong cells of the parenchyma is endowed with
electromotive properties, which correspond with those of the “muscle
cylinder” of animals; with this exception, that whereas in the muscle
cylinder the ends are negative to the central zone, in the vegetable cell
 they are positive; and he endeavours to prove, that according to this
 theory, all the complicated electromotive phenomena which had been
observed, could be shown to be attributable to the peculiar arrange
 ment of the leaf-cells.
    During the last two summers Dr. Burdon Sanderson has been
engaged in endeavouring to discover the true relations which subsist
between the electrical disturbance, followed by the shutting of the
leaf-valves of Dionaba and the latent change of protoplasm which
precedes this operation.      He has found that though the mechanism
of the    change   of form of the excitable parenchyma which causes
 the contraction is entirely different from that of muscular contraction,
yet that the correspondence between the exciting process in the animal
tissues, and what represents this in plant tissues appears to be more
 complete the more carefully the comparison is made; and that
 whether the stimulus be mechanical, thermal, or electrical, its effects
 correspond in each case.      Again, the excitation is propagated from
 the point of excitation to distant points in the order of their remoteness,
 and the degree to which the structure is excited depends upon its
 temperature.     Notwithstanding, however, the striking analogies be
 tween the electrical properties of the cells of Dionaba and of muscle
 cylinders, Dr. Burdon Sanderson is wholly unable to admit with
 Professor Munk that these structures are in this respect comparable.
    In Morphological Botany     attention  has been especially directed of
 late to the complete life-history of the lower order of Cryptogams,
 since this is seen to be more and more an indispensable preliminary to
 any attempt at their correct classification.

    The   remarkable     theory   of Schwendener,   now ten years old,
astonished     botanists  by boldly sweeping away the claims to auto
nomous      recognition    of a whole group of highly characteristic
organisms—the Lichens—and by affirming that these consist of asco
mycetal fungi united in a commensal existence with Algae. The con
troversial literature and renewed investigations which this theory has
given rise to are now very considerable.        But the advocates of the
 Schwendenerian view have          gradually won their ground, and the
success which has attended the experiments of Stahl in taking up the
challenge of Schwendener's           opponents and manufacturing such
lichens as     Endocarpon    and  Thelidium, by the juxtaposition of the
appropriate Algae and Fungi, may almost be regarded as deciding the
question.     Sachs, in the last edition of his Lehrbuch, has carried out
completely the principle of classification of Algae, first suggested by
Cohn, and has proposed one for the remaining Thallophytes, which
disregards their division into Fungi and Algae.       He looks upon the
former as standing in the same relation to the latter as the so-called
 Saprophytes (e.g. Neottia) do to ordinary green flowering-plants.
    This view has especial interest with regard to the minute organisms
 known as Bacteria, a knowledge of the life-history of which is of the
 greatest importance, having regard to the changes which they effect
 in all lifeless and, probably, in all living matter prone to decom
 position. This affords a morphological argument (as far as it goes)
 against the doctrine of Spontaneous Generation, since it seems
 extremely probable that just as yeast may be a degraded form of some
 higher fungus, Bacteria may be degraded allies of the Oscillatoriae which
 have adopted a purely saprophytal mode of existence.
    Your “Proceedings” for the present year contain several important
 contributions to our knowledge of the lowest forms of life. The Rev.
 W. H. Dallinger, continuing those researches which his skill in using
 the highest microscopic powers and his ingenuity in devising experi
 mental methods have rendered so fruitful, has adduced evidence which
 seems to leave no doubt that the spores or germs of the monad which
 he has described differ in a remarkable manner from the young or
 adult monads in their power of resisting heated fluids. The young
 and adult monads, in fact, were always killed by five minutes'
 exposure to a temperature of 142° F (61° C.), while the spores
 germinated after being subjected to a temperature of ten degrees
 above the boiling point of water (222°F.).
    Two years ago, Cohn and Koch observed the development of spores
 within the rods of Bacillus subtilis and B. anthracis. These observa
 tions have been confirmed, with important additions, in these two
 species   by Mr. Ewart, and have been extended to the Bacillus of the
 infectious pneumo-enteritis of the pig, by Dr. Klein; and to Spirillum
 by Messrs. Geddes and Ewart; and thus a very important step has

of these minute but important organisms.    Dr. Klein has shown tha.

followed its ordinary course.       now therefore, distinctly proved

to all future         researches regarding the geographical               distribution of
plants in the southern hemisphere, and the evolution therein of generic
and specific types, cannot be over estimated.
   The other great work is the “Flora Braziliensis,” commenced by
our   late Foreign Fellow, von Martius, and now ably carried                       on by
Eichler, of Berlin, assisted by coadjutors (among whom are most of
our leading systematists) under the liberal auspices of His Majesty the
Emperor of Brazil. When completed, this gigantic undertaking will
have embraced, in a systematic form, the vegetation of the richest
botanical region of the globe.
  Having now endeavoured       to recall to you some of the great
advances in Science made  during the last few years, it remains for me,
after the distribution of the Medals awarded by your Council, to
                                                  I
retire from the Presidency in which have so long experienced the
generous support of your Officers and yourselves. This support, for
which    Itender you my hearty thanks, together with my sense of the
trust and dignity of the office, and the interest attached to its duties,
make my resignation of it a more difficult step than I had anticipated.
My  reasons are, however, strong. They are the pressure of official
duties at Kew, annually increasing in amount and responsibility,
together with the engagements               I
                                  am under to complete scientific
works, undertaken jointly with other botanists, before you raised
me to the Presidency; and the fact that indefinite postponement
delays the publication of the labours of my coadjutors.      am                    I
also influenced by the consideration that, though wholly opposed
to the view that the term of the Presidency of the Royal Society
should be either short or definitely limited, this term should not be very
long; and that, considering the special nature of my own scientific
studies, it should, in my case, on this as well as on other grounds, be
briefer than might otherwise be desirable.        Cogent as these reasons
are, they might not have been paramount, were it not that we
have among us, one pre-eminently fitted to be your President by
scientific attainments, by personal qualifications, and by intimate
knowledge of the Society's affairs; and by calling upon whom to fill
the proud position which             I
                               have occupied, you are also recognising
the great services he has rendered to the Society as its Treasurer
for eight years, and         its
                         ofttimes munificent benefactor.

   The Copley Medal has been awarded                  to   Jean Baptiste Boussingault

for his long-continued and important researches and discoveries in
agricultural chemistry.
   The researches of Boussingault have extended over nearly half a
century, and it might be difficult to find an investigator whose results
relating to a great variety of subjects have in respect of accuracy and
trustworthiness better stood the test of time.
   The lucid simplicity with which his writings narrate well-established
and well-arranged facts, is not less remarkable than the judicial caution
with which he      has abstained from expressing          opinions upon questions
beyond the reach of decisive evidence.
   His experimental results and the conclusions which he has drawn
from them have been deservedly trusted by other workers in the same
field, and have safely guided them in their labours.   Their incon
testable excellence has prevented them from becoming subjects of
animated discussion, and thus arousing as much attention and interest
in the outer world as has sometimes been aroused by hasty experi
ments and daring generalizations.
     I cannotattempt within the limits of this address to give an account
of his investigations, and    I
                             should probably weary you were       even to  I
enumerate them, relating as they do to a vast variety of phenomena;
      I
but may point out that lying as most of them do in the domain of
agricultural chemistry, they have involved difficulties of no common
order.   Boussingault is not only an excellent chemical analyst and
experimentalist,     but at the same time a model farmer.
     His numerous determinations of the nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen
in crops and in the manures supplied to them, have proved him to be
skilled not only in selecting and applying the best known methods of
analysis, but even in improving and perfecting them.
   His determinations of the proportions of those valuable constituents
of manures which can be assimilated by various crops, have involved
an intimate acquaintance with the conditions which experience has
proved to be most favourable to the cultivation of the various crops.
   His numerous and varied experiments on the feeding of animals,
showing the proportions between the nitrogenized and fatty or amy
laceous constituents supplied in the food and those assimilated or
formed by the animal organism, while tracing the distribution of the
remainder between the pulmonary and other excretions, have had
most important physiological as well as practical bearings.
   In     all
           his investigations we see proofs that while accurately and
critically acquainted with the discoveries and opinions              of
                                                          other workers
and thinkers    inhis own particular domain     science,
                                                     of              he
                                                          has been able
to devise and carry out simple and crucial forms                of   experiment well
calculated to decide the truth.
  A remarkable instance           of thisis afforded       by
                                                         those truly masterly
experiments     by
              which         he    proved that  all the nitrogen  found    the  in

organism of plants can be traced to compounds of that element which
had been supplied to them; and accordingly that there are no grounds
for believing that plants can assimilate the free nitrogen of the air.
   By awarding to Boussingault the Copley Medal, we place his name
in the honoured list of those who, in modern times, have rendered the
highest services to the advancement of natural knowledge.
   A Royal Medal has been awarded to Mr. John Allan Broun for his
investigations during thirty-five years in magnetism and meteorology,
and for his improved methods of observation.
   When the labours of Gauss had given an impetus to the study of
terrestrial magnetism by rendering precision possible, Observatories
devoted to this branch of research, in conjunction with meteorology,
began to rise in various places. The late General Sir T. M. Brisbane
erected one at Makerstown, in Scotland, and placed it under the direc
tion of Mr. Broun, who remained in charge of it from 1842 to 1850.
His observations and their results, have been commended by magne
ticians and meteorologists, for the skill employed in the development
of new methods of reduction and investigation.
   In 1851 Mr. Broun went to India to organize and take charge of a
similar Observatory established at Trevandrum by His Highness the
late Rajah of Travancore. Here he remained for thirteen years,
accumulating results of very great value, the first instalment of which,
consisting of a volume on the magnetic declination, was published
some years ago. Magneticians look eagerly towards the completion
of this publication when the means necessary for the purpose shall
have been furnished to Mr. Broun.
   While in India he established an Observatory on a mountain peak
6,000 feet above the sea, and fitted it up with a very complete assort
ment of scientific instruments.       This was an undertaking of a very
arduous   nature, effected in a wild country, and presenting great diffi
culties in the erection of instruments and obtaining trained observers.
   Shortly after the commencement of magnetic observatories, Mr.
Broun indicated the insufficiencies of the methods then in use for
determining coefficients and correcting observations, and he devised
new methods for these ends, the principal of which have been gene
rally adopted.
   This is not the place in which to give a complete catalogue of Mr.
Broun's researches in magnetism and meteorology, extending as they
do over a period of thirty-five years, but   I may indicate those of his
results that are of the    greatest  importance.  Among them are the
establishment of the annual laws of magnetic horizontal force,
exhibiting maxima at the solstices and minima at the equinoxes.
Mr. Broun was also the first to give in a complete form the laws of
change of the solar-diurnal variation of magnetic declination near the

equator, showing the extinction of the mean movement near the
equinox.   His researches on the lunar-diurnal variation of magnetic
declination are of very great interest.   Besides being an independent
discoverer of the existence of this variation, he showed that near the
equator     law  its
                   December was the opposite
                             in                  that    June.   He                of        in
found, too, that the lunar-diurnal variation was    December some                       in
times greater than the solar-diurnal variation—that the lunar action
was reversed      sunrise, and that
                            at         was much greater during the day

than during the night, whether the moon was above             below the                       or
horizon.   Finally,               he
                        found that the lunar-diurnal law   changed   (like
the solar-diurnal law      the equator) near the equinoxes,
                                       at                      that,                              so             as

consequence, the laws for the southern and northern hemispheres
were     opposite natures.
            of
  Another and very remarkable fact discovered by Mr. Broun was
that the variations from day           day      the earth's daily mean
                                                         to             of
horizontal force were nearly the same all the world over.      He found
certain oscillations  these daily means which were due

he considered as due                   to   the sun's rotation.              It    results from        these     in
vestigations  that the observed variations      the earth's daily mean       of
horizontal force have been    represented with considerable accuracy                                              in
all their more marked features, by the combination           the means                        of
calculated for these different solar and lunar    periods.  During   the
discussion     these periods, Mr. Broun found that the great magnetic
                       of
disturbances were apparently                          due     to   actions proceeding              from      par
ticular points   meridians   or  the sun—a fact this (if verified)

value got from those two astronomical phenomena, combined with the
parallax     the sun, assumed known. But the difficulties

   A double award of the recently instituted Davy Medal has again been
made, the recipients on the present occasion being M. Louis Paul
Cailletet and M. Raoul Pictet.       This award is made to these dis
tinguished men for having, independently and contemporaneously,
liquefied the whole of the gases hitherto called permanent.
   The methods pursued by these experimenters, in accomplishing
results which equal in interest and importance those obtained by
Faraday in the same direction fifty-five years ago, were quite distinct,
and were, in each case, the result of several years' preparatory labour.
M. Cailletet, by comparatively very simple arrangements, such as
admit of ready employment in lecture-demonstrations, has succeeded
in obtaining evidence of the liquefaction, and possibly solidification, of
carbonic oxide, marsh-gas, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen.            His
system of operating consists in submitting the gases to very powerful
compression at comparatively moderate degrees of cold, and in then
allowing them very suddenly to expand.
   M. Pictet has applied the very perfect system, elaborated and put
to industrial use by him, for obtaining low temperatures to the attain
ment, though on a larger scale, of results like some of those arrived
at by M. Cailletet.   By an arrangement of vacuum and force pumps
he reduces liquefied sulphurous acid to a low temperature, and applies
this as the means for cooling down liquid carbonic acid which, in
turn, serves to reduce to a very low temperature a thick glass tube, in
which the gas to be condensed is confined at a very high pressure.
M. Pictet has not only produced liquid oxygen in somewhat consider
able quantity, and succeeded in determining its density, he has also
obtained evidence of the solidification of hydrogen, and the description
given of its appearance in the solid form seems to leave no doubt
regarding its metallic character.
   The interest which attaches to the remarkable experiments of
MM. Cailletet and Pictet is only equalled by the importance of the
fact, now absolutely demonstrated by those experiments, that the
property of molecular cohesion is common to all known bodies without
exception.

   Magnetic Work.—The Magnetographs have been    constant operation       in
throughout the year, but only few magnetic disturbances have been
registered, the period being one   almost continued magnetic calm.

The most notable perturbation was that    May 15th.        of
  The scale values of all the instruments were re-determined                                    in
January,     accordance with the usual practice.

zontal and vertical force   magnets;  zinc cylinders with glass covers
being substituted for the glass shades lined with gold-leaf previously
employed, which were found                      be
                                   very expensive

breakage.
   The tabulation      of
                       the magnetic curves has not been continued
during the year, the time     the department being very fully occupied

                        Report of  the Kew Committee.                   81
 made as usual by Mr. Figg, and the results are given in Tables
appended to this Report.
     The catalogue of the documents and papers in the late Magnetic
Office, directed by Sir E. Sabine, having been completed, a selection
was made of all those relating to marine observations, and at the
request of the Hydrographer, these were transferred to the Hydro
graphic Department of the Admiralty.
    The magnetic instruments have been examined and knowledge of
their manipulation obtained by Lieutenants           Speelman    and van
Hasselt, of the Dutch Navy; Professor Greene, of the United States
Navy; M. Hooreman, of the Brussels Observatory; and Dr. T. E.
Thorpe, F.R.S.
    The latter gentleman made a series of base observations at Kew
before and after an extended tour, for the purpose of a magnetic
                                                                           P
survey along the fortieth parallel of latitude in the United States.
    A large magnet and a journeyman clock, the property of the Royal
Observatory, Greenwich, which have been for many years at Kew,
have been     returned to the former establishment at the request of the
Astronomer Royal.
    Information on matters relating to terrestrial magnetism and various
data have been supplied         to the Hydrographic Office, Mr. Adie,
Mr. Archbutt, Mr. Gordon, and Mr. Frost.
    Meteorological Work.—The several self-recording instruments for the
continuous registration respectively of pressure, temperature, humidity,
wind (direction and velocity), and rain have been maintained in regular
operation under the care of Mr. T. W. Baker, assisted by J. Hillier.
    The daily standard eye observations, for the control of the automatic
records have been made regularly, as well as daily observations in
connexion with the Washington synchronous system.
    The tabulation of the meteorological traces has been regularly
carried on by Mr. Hawkesworth, and copies have been transmitted
 weekly to the Meteorological Office.
    In compliance with a request made by the Meteorological Council
 to the Kew Committee, the Observatories          at Aberdeen, Armagh.
 Falmouth, Glasgow, Stonyhurst, and Valencia have been visited and
 their instruments inspected by Mr. Whipple, who has also inspected
 the telegraph-reporting and climatological stations throughout Ireland,
 an allowance has been made by the Meteorological Office to Kew, for
 the time occupied by Mr. Whipple on this duty.
     With the sanction of the Meteorological    Council, weekly abstracts
 of the meteorological results have been regularly forwarded to and
 published by “the Times,” “Illustrated London News,” and “Mid
  Surrey   Times;”   and meteorological data have been supplied amongst
 others   to Mr. G. J. Symons, F.R.S., Dr. Rowland, Mr. Mawley, and
  the Institute of Mining Engineers.

 82.                     Report of   the Kew Committee.
     Electrograph.—This instrument has been in almost continuous action
 through the year under the care of Mr. Harrison. Certain improve
 ments in minor details, suggested by Sir W. Thomson, have been
 introduced from time to time.
     It has been thought desirable to make a determination of the scale
 value of the instrument throughout the whole extent of its range.
 The Committee not possessing a sufficiently powerful battery for the
 purpose, the Electrometer was conveyed at Mr. De La Rue's sugges
 tion to his Laboratory, where a complete determination of its scale
 value was made over the range of tension, afforded by 1,200 chloride
 of silver cells. A detailed account of the experiment was afterwards
 laid before the Royal Society, and printed in the “Proceedings,” vol.
 xxvii, p. 356."
     At the request of Professor Mascart, a typical set of curves.
 illustrating the action of the Electrograph during different kinds of
 weather, was       reduced and engraved by the Pantagraph                 at the
 Meteorological     Office, and forwarded for his use in illustration of the
lectures he delivered before the Société Météorologique de France.
     These engravings have since been reproduced, together with notes
 respecting the instrument, in a Report on Atmospheric Electricity,
drawn up by Professor Everett, for the Permanent Committee of the
Vienna Congress, which is about to be published by the authority of
the Meteorological Council.
    The late Captain R. G. Scott, R.E., and since his decease, Captain R.
Y. Armstrong, R.E., visited the Observatory and inspected the working
 of the instrument with the view of possibly utilizing the Electro
meter in the study of atmospheric electricity             at the various torpedo
stations round the coast.
     Two Electrographs, similar in construction to the instrument at
 Kew, have been constructed by Mr. White, of Glasgow, and after
examination at the Observatory, forwarded, the one to the Brussels
Observatory, the other to Zi-ka-Wei, China.
    Photoheliograph.—The        re-examination of the measurements of the
Kew      sun-pictures,   as noticed in former Reports, has been steadily
carried    on throughout the year by Mr. Whipple, assisted by Mr.
M‘Laughlin, who has been temporarily engaged for this purpose.
    During the year upwards of 400 pictures have been measured, and
it is hoped that the end of the series will be reached in the early
months of 1879.
    * With the view of rendering the indications of the instrument better adapted
for treatment with the Harmonic Analyser, it is in contemplation to somewhat alter
the existing bifilar suspension of the needle, and at the same time to adopt the
new insulating stand devised by Professor Mascart (“Nature,” vol. xviii, p. 44)
which will be substituted for the present supports of the water reservoir.   These
changes may cause a short discontinuity in the observations.

                          Report of   the      Kew Committee.                            83
     Mr. Marth is still engaged on the reduction to heliocentric elements
of the pictures  for 1864 to 1868 inclusive.
   All of these operations have been conducted under the direction and
at the expense of Mr. De La Rue.
  The eye-observations     of the sun, after the method of Hofrath
Schwabe, have been made daily, when possible, as described in the
Report  for 1872, in order for the present to maintain the continuity
of the Kew record of sun-spots.
    Extra Observations.—The      Solar-radiation Thermometers are still
observed   daily, and a new form of the instrument designed by Pro
 fessor G. C.  Foster, is at present undergoing trial.
    The question of observing Solar Radiation having been referred by
the Meteorological Council to the Kew Committee, a sub-committee
has been appointed to take the whole subject into consideration.
   The Campbell Sundial described in the 1875 Report, continues in
action, and the improved form of the instrument, giving a separate
record for every day, of the duration of sunshine, has been regu
larly worked throughout the year and its curves tabulated.
   A paper comparing the relative amount of sunshine recorded by this
instrument during the year 1877, with the amount registered at the
Royal Observatory, Greenwich, by a similar apparatus, has been read
by the Superintendent before the Meteorological        Society, and pub
lished in their Quarterly Report, vol. iv, No. 28.     It shows that the
difference in the total duration      of sunshine observed at the two
stations, which amounted to 171 hours in the year, was in great mea
sure due to the preponderance of westerly winds, which carry the
smoke of the metropolis over the Royal Observatory.
  A copy of the Kew instrument,      constructed by Mr. Browning for
the Brussels Observatory, has been  compared   at the Observatory; and
another instrument, with a new form of mounting, designed by Mr.
R. J. Lecky, F.R.A.S., is at present being tried.
  Wind Component Integrator.—This instrument, at the time of the
last Report, was working temporarily, attached to the Kew                   Anemo
graph.  This arrangement was found, however, to interfere                  with the
regular action of the latter instrument, and accordingly     own cupsits
and vane, sent over
                       by
                       Professor von Oettingen, have been fitted                    to
                                                                                     it

    In  addition, 134 Thermometers            have been tested at the           melting
point of mercury.
    14 Standard Thermometers          have been calibrated and divided.
    The following miscellaneous instruments have also                    been verified:

    There are at present in the Observatory undergoing verification,
19 Barometers,
             -       182 Thermometers, 4 Anemometers, and 1 Rain
gauge.
   A   number   of Aneroid Barometers, of a new pattern, have been
received from MM. Hottinger and Co., of Zürich, for comparison.
    The  “Hall Mark,”       figured in last report, has been etched, at the
desire of the makers, upon a number of the Thermometers compared                          r
at the Observatory.
    A Hydraulic Press especially constructed for the purpose of sub
jecting Deep    sea.  Thermometers to pressures similar to those they
experience when sunk to great depths, has been erected in the work
shop, by Messrs. Hopkinson and Cope.                      It is capable of exerting
a strain  equal  to 4 tons on the      square      inch.     Several protected Ther
mometers have been found to stand this test successfully.
    Air Thermometer.—The Committee are taking steps to obtain a
standard air thermometer.
   The old “Royal Society.” Standard Barometer, with the flint and
crown-glass tubes refilled by Negretti and Zambra, has been compared
with the Kew standard daily for several months.                       Its scale has also
been measured and its error determined.
    Comparison of Standard Barometers.—The account of the com
parison of the Standard Barometers at Greenwich and Kew, which
resulted in proving a close agreement between the standards of the
two    Observatories,    was published         in the “Royal Society Proceed
ings,” vol. xxvii, p.   76.
    With a view to determine the source of small variations in the
correction to the working standard of the Observatory (Newman 34)
and the large Welsh's standards, numerous comparisons have been
made between the instruments, from time to time, but as yet without
Success.
    Professor B. Stewart has          had similar series of readings made
 between the Owens        College   ordinary        Standard Barometer and one
 after the Kew model, also filled by Welsh's system. The results tend
 to show a most close agreement between the two forms of instru

  Freezing Point of Water.–In consequence of a communication from
Dr. Guthrie as to the presence of cryohydrates in water lowering its
freezing point, a series of experiments was made for determining the
melting point of distilled-water ice, rainwater ice, clean pond ice, and
the commercial ice used at the Observatory.         It was found to be
practically identical in                 all

    Long. 0" 1" 15*1 W., for the year October 1877 to September 1878.
    The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed
Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked K C 1, and
the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones.
    The Declination observations have also been made with the same
Magnetometer, Collimator Magnet N E being employed for the purpose.
    The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle No. 33, the needles
1 and 2 only being used; these are 3% inches in length.
    The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the
values of the Horizontal Force, which, being combined with the Dip
observations, furnish the Vertical and Total Forces.
    These are expressed in both English and metrical scales—the unit in
the first being one foot, one second of mean solar time, and one
grain; and in the other one millimetre, one second of time, and one
milligramme, the factor for reducing the English to metric values
being 0.46108.
    By request, the corresponding     values in C.G.S. measure are also
 given.
    The value of log "K employed in the reduction is 1:64365 at tem
 perature 60° F.
    The induction-coefficient u is 0.000194.
    The correction of the magnetic power for temperature t, to an
 adopted standard temperature of 35° F is
                 0.0001194(t,—35)   +0.000,000,213(t.—35)*,
    The true distances between the centres of the deflecting and deflected
 magnets, when the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection
 bar marked 1-0 foot and 1.3 feet, are 1:000075 feet and 1:3000.97 feet
 respectively.
    The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from the
 mean of 12 or 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in
 making 100 vibrations, corrections being applied for the torsion-force
 of the suspension-thread subsequently.
    No corrections have been made for rate of chronometer or arc of
 vibration, these being always very small.
    The value of the constant P, employed in the formula of reduction
                    is -0.00179.

    In each observation of absolute Declination   the instrumental   read
 ings have been referred to marks made upon the stone obelisk erected
 about a  quarter of a mile north of the Observatory as a meridian mark,
 the orientation of which, with respect to the Magnetometer, was de
  termined by the late Mr. Welsh, and has since been carefully verified.
    The observations have all been made and reduced by Mr. F. G. Figg.

At the top     of a

The radiometer can therefore be connected with an induction coil,

   Passing over the phenomena observed                              at
                                          low exhaustions, the author
finds that, when connected with the coil,     halo       velvety violet  a              of   a
light forms        on
                 the metallic side    the vanes, the mica side remaining
                                                   of
dark throughout these experiments.         As the pressure diminishes,                                           a
dark   space   seen
               is      separate

positive rotation commences.
  On continuing the exhaustion, the dark space further widens out
and appears    flatten itself against the glass, and the rotation becomes
                   to
very rapid.
  When aluminium cups are used for the vanes instead                 disks                               of

On still further exhaustion, and especially if the cup is made positive,
the bulb becomes beautifully illuminated with greenish-yellow phos
phorescent light.
   This greenish-yellow phosphorescence, characteristic of high ex
haustions, is frequently spoken of in the paper. It must be remem
bered, however, that the particular colour is due to the special kind of
soft German glass used. Other kinds of glass phosphoresce in a dif
ferent colour. The phosphorescence takes place only under the in
fluence of the rays from the negative pole. At an exhaustion of 4 M*,
no light other than this is seen in the apparatus. At 9 M the phosphor
escence is about at its maximum. When the exhaustion reaches 15 M
the spark has a difficulty in passing, and the green light appears occa
sionally in flashes only.     At 06 M the vacuum is almost non-con
 ductive, and a spark can be forced through only by increasing the
 intensity of the coil, and well insulating the tube and wires leading
 toit.   Beyond that exhaustion nothing has been observed.

production of light accompanies this sudden arrest of velocity.             The
light proceeds from    the glass, and is apparently caused by fluores
cence or phosphorescence on its surface. No light is produced by a mica
or quartz screen, and the more fluorescent the material the better the
luminosity. Here the consideration arises that the greenish-yellow
light is an effect of the arrest of the negatively electrified molecules
by the surface of the glass; but whether they actually strike the
glass, or whether at the boundary surface separating solid from gaseous
matter, there are intermediary layers of condensed gas which, taking
up the blow, pass it on to the layer beneath, are problems the solution
of which must be left to further research. The shadows are not
optical, but are molecular shadows, revealed only by an ordinary
illuminating effect; this is proved by the sharpness of the shadow
when projected from a wide pole.
                          Phosphorescence     of Thin Films.
   An experiment is   next described in which a film of uranium glass,
sufficiently thin to show colours of thin plates, is placed in front of a
thick plate of the same glass; the whole being enclosed in a tube with
terminals, and exhausted to a few millionths of an atmosphere.         Of
this the following observations are recorded:—
   a. The uranium film, being next to the negative pole, casts a strong
shadow on the plate.
   b. On making contact with the coil, the thin film flashes out sud
 denly all over its surface with a yellowish phosphorescence, which,
 however, instantly disappears.  The uncovered part of the plate does
 not become phosphorescent quite suddenly, but the phosphorescence is
 permanent as long as the coil is kept at work.
    c. With an exceedingly faint spark the film remains more luminous
 than the plate, but on intensifying the spark, the luminosity of the
 film sinks and that of the uncovered part of the plate increases.
    d. If a single intense spark be suddenly sent through the tube, the
 film becomes very luminous, while the plate remains dark.
    These experiments are conclusive against the phosphorescence being
 an effect of the radiation of phosphorogenic ultra-violet light from a
 thin layer of arrested molecules at the surface of the glass, for were
 this the case, the film could under no circumstances be superior to the
 plate.
   The    momentary       phosphorescence       and rapid   fading   of the film
 prove  more than this.    The molecular bombardment                 is too much
 for the thin film. It responds thereto at first, but immediately gets
 heated by the impacts, and then ceases to be luminous.    The plate,
 however, being thick, bears the hammering without growing hot
 enough to lose   its   power   of   phosphorescing.

               Mechanical Action of Projected Molecules.
  When the coil was first turned on, the thin film was driven back at
the moment of becoming phosphorescent, showing that an actual
material blow had been given by the molecules.        Experiments are
next described in which this mechanical action is rendered more
evident.  A small rotating fly, capable cf being moved about in any
part of an exhausted bulb, is used as an ndicator, and by appropriate
means the molecular shadow of an aluminium plate is projected along
the bulb.   Whether entirely in, or entirely out of the shadow, the
indicator scarcely moves, but when immersed so that one-half is ex
posed to molecular impact the                       fly

tive pole. The molecules are projected from the negative, but the posi
tion of the positive pole—whether in front, at the side, or even behind
the negative pole—has no influence on their subsequent behaviour,
either in producing phosphorescence, or mechanical effects, or in their
magnetic deflection.          The magnet gives their line of path a spiral
twist, greater or less according to its power, but diminishing as the
molecules get further off.
     Numerous experiments were tried in this apparatus with different
 gases, and with the magnet in and out of position.
     Working with exhausted air it was found that the spot of
 green phosphorescence         on the screen is visible at an exhaustion of
 102.6     M,   when the free path of the molecules, measured by the
 thickness of the dark space round the negative pole, is only
 12 millims.       Hence, it follows, that a number of molecules sufficient
 to excite green phosphorescence on the screen are projected the whole
 distance from the pole to the screen, or 102 millims, without being
 stopped by collisions.
                                                                                     *
                          Alteration of Molecular Velocity.
     If   we suppose the horseshoe magnet to be permanently in position,
  and thus to exert a uniform downward pressure on the molecules,
  we perceive that their trajectory is much curved at low exhaustions,
                                                                                  :s
  and gets flatter as the exhaustion increases. A flatter trajectory corre
  sponds to a higher velocity.        This may arise from one of two condi        t
  tions; either the initial impulse given by the negative pole is stronger,
  or the molecules experience       less resistance.   The latter is probably the
  true one. The molecules which produce the green phosphorescence
  must be looked upon as in a state differing from those arrested by
  frequent collisions.      Any action which impedes the velocity of the
  free molecules allows longer time for the magnetism to act on
  them; and, although the deflecting force of magnetism might be
  expected to decrease with the velocity of the molecules, Professor
   Stokes has pointed out that it would have to decrease as the square
  of the velocity, in order that the deflection should be no greater at
   low than at high velocities.
      Comparing the free molecules to cannon balls, the magnetic deflection
  to the earth's gravitation, and the electrical excitation of the negative
  pole to the explosion of the powder in the gun, the trajectory will be
  flat when no gravitation acts, and curved when under the influence of
  gravitation.     It  is also much curved when the ball passes through
  a dense resisting    medium; it is less curved when the resisting medium
  gets rarer; and, as already shown, intensifying the induction spark,
   equivalent to increasing the charge of powder, gives greater initial
   velocity, and therefore flattens the trajectory.          The parallelism is
   still closer if we  compare    the evolution of   light seen when the shot

   The author finally describes an apparatus in which he shows that
great heat is evolved when the concentrated focus of rays from a
nearly hemispherical    aluminium     cup is deflected sideways by a
magnet to the walls of the glass tube. By using a somewhat larger
hemisphere and allowing the negative focus to fall on a strip of
platinum foil, the heat rises to the melting point of platinum.
                         An Ultra-gaseous State of Matter.
   The paper concludes with some theoretical speculations on the state
in which the matter exists in these highly exhausted vessels. The
modern idea of the gaseous state is based upon the supposition that a
given space contains millions of millions of molecules in rapid move
ment in all directions, each having millions of encounters in a second.
In such a case, the length of the mean free path of the molecules is ex
ceedingly small as compared with the dimensions of the vessel, and
the properties which constitute the ordinary gaseous state of matter,
which depend upon constant collisions, are observed.      But by great
rarefaction the free   path is made so   long that the hits in a given
time     may be disregarded  in comparison to the misses, in which
case the average molecule  is allowed to obey its own motions or laws
without interference; and if the mean free path is comparable to the
dimensions of the vessel, the properties which constitute gaseity are
reduced to a minimum, and the matter becomes exalted to an ultra
gaseous state, in which the very decided but hitherto masked pro
perties now under investigation come into play.

     speaking of a ray of molecular light, the author has been guided
    In
more by a desire for conciseness of expression than by a wish to advance
a novel theory.    But he believes that the comparison, under these
special circumstances, is strictly correct, and that he is as well entitled
to speak of a ray of molecular or emissive light when its presence is
detected only by the light evolved when it falls on a suitable screen,
as he is to speak of a sunbeam in a darkened room as a ray of vibratory

    other Open Channels.”    By JAMES THOMSON, LL.D., D.Sc.,
     F.R.S., and F.R.S.E., Professor of Civil Engineering and
      Mechanics in the University of Glasgow.                                 Received        Au

  In respect to the mode of flow of water in rivers,        supposition           a
which has been very perplexing in attempts to form a rational theory
for its explanation, has during many years past, during at least a great
part of the present century, been put forward as a result from experi
mental observations on the flow of water in various rivers, and in
artificially constructed channels. It was,                    I
                                             presume, put forward in
the earlier times    only as a vague and doubtful supposition; but, in
later times it has, in virtue of more numerous and more elaborately
conducted experimental observations, advanced to the rank of a con
firmed supposition, or even of an experimentally established fact.
This experimentally derived and gradually growing supposition was
perplexing, because it was in conflict with a very generally adopted
theory of the flow of water in rivers which appeared to be well
founded and well reasoned out.
   That commonly received theory, which for brevity we may call the
laminar theory, was one in which the frictional resistance applied by
the bottom or bed of the river against the forward motion of the
water was recognized as the main or the only important drag hinder
ing the water, in its downhill course under the influence of gravity,
from advancing with a continually increasing velocity; and in which
it was assumed that if the entire current is imagined as divided into
numerous layers approximately horizontal across the stream, or else
trough-shaped so as to have a general conformity with the bed of the
river, each of these layers should be imagined as flowing forward
 quicker than the one next below               it,

1878.]       Uniform Régime in Rivers and other Open Channels.         117
structed in wood, and were open above, and had a flat bottom and
vertical sides, so that the current was rectangular in cross-section.
Channels of various other forms were also used, and the mode of flow
of the water in them was scrutinized.       The results arrived at by these
experimenters tend very much towards establishing the supposition
which forms the subject of the present paper—the supposition namely
of the prevalence or frequent occurrence of a distribution of velocities
having the maximum velocity not at the surface but at some moderate
depth below. Boileau, by his experiments, was led to announce as
one of his conclusions (page 308), that in the medial longitudinal ver
tical section of a rectangular canal with uniform régime, the maximum
of velocity is situated not at the surface, but at a depth which is a
fraction more or less considerable of the total depth of the current.
He also announced, as a conclusion, that the decrease of velocity, from
the place of maximum velocity up to the surface, must be attributed
to some new cause different from that which produces the diminution
 of velocity from the place of maximum down to the bottom. This
 new cause, he says, cannot be solely the resistance of the bed of air in
 contact with the liquid surface acting like the face of a pipe or con
 duit; and he assigns, in proof of this, the reason that the mobility of
 this bed of air does not permit of our attributing to it a retarding in
 fluence so great as that which is implied in the rapid abatement of
 velocities in approach towards the surface in the upper part of the
 current. He recounts his own special experiments, made in 1845, on
 the influence of wind on the velocities in currents,—a subject which
 he says had up to that time been very little investigated by hydrau
 licians. He deduces from his experiments conclusions (page 313)
 to the effect that in spite of varied disturbances produced by wind
  blowing over the water with varied intensity, yet there is manifested
 a very sensible tendency to a decrease of velocities of the water for
 approach towards the liquid surface; and that the maximum velocity
  is yet below the surface, even when the wind blows forward with the
  current, and has a velocity greater than that of the current.    Judging,
  then, that resistance of the air cannot be the cause of the phenomenon,
  he says that it is then principally in the mutual actions which bind
  among one another the liquid particles, and in the oblique and rotatory
  movements which result, under the influence of these forces, from the
  difference of velocities of neighbouring particles, that it is necessary
  to seek for the explanation of the phenomena of the decrease of velo
  cities in the approach towards the surface of currents.     He goes on to
   say that we have to conceive, in fine, that these oblique movements,
   producing transverse living forces (“forces wives”), diminish according
   to certain general laws, the living forces of forward motion which the
   hydrometric instruments are adapted to indicate.

     Quite recently, in 1874–75, experiments were conducted in India on the
Ganges Canal, close to Roorkee, by Captain Allan Cunningham, R.E.*
These experiments bring out among their results, very remarkably,
the frequently alleged phenomenon of the maximum velocity of the
water being not at the surface, but at some moderate depth below.
And further, it is deserving of special notice that those of his experi
ments, which have chiefly to be referred to as throwing light on this
subject, were made in an aqueduct about 85 feet wide, and with an
approximately level bottom; and that the depths of the water in
different experiments ranged from about 6 feet to about 93 feet, so
 that the width was on different occasions from about nine times to
 about fourteen times the depth, and yet the maximum of the velocities
 at mid-channel (or the maximum velocity in the longitudinal medial
 vertical section) came out by averages of numerous results, and, by
 varied modes of experimenting, to be very decidedly below the sur

   On     this point Mr. Gordon (in his Introductory Note, § vii, page ii of
   date 16th       June, 1875) intimates his intention to make further experi
   ments      with other instruments, but still asserts his confidence in his
    previous methods and results.

       Until about two years ago had not happened to become acquainted
   with any of the evidence for the phenomenon in question except the
    unsatisfying experimental results given by Ellet; but about two years
    ago    I met with     accounts of some of the more recent and more convinc
    ing experimental        investigations.    It then appeared to me that if the
    asserted phenomenon must really be accepted as a truth, there ought
    to be some mode possible of accounting for it: and a theory occurred
    to me              I
              which now propose to submit.
        The mode of thought which near the beginning of the present paper
     I  have described as constituting the laminar theory,            I must premise,
     has long appeared to me to be an erroneous and a very misleading
     view.      It was a very prevalent mode of thought, and was usually too
     influential on people's minds even when they did entertain decidedly,
     though often not clearly enough, the consideration of eddies and trans
     verse movements          or commingling currents       with different velocities.

the interior of the current, and have been gaining forward acceleration
there are gradually expelled, or do gradually flow from that region, and
come themselves into close proximity to the resisting channel face;
and so, in their turn, do receive very directly backward forces from
the face, because in proximity to it processes of fluid distortion subject
to viscid resistance are going on with great activity and intensity.
   The transverse motions have their origin primarily in the rush of
the water along the wetted channel face. When that face is rough or
irregular with lumps and hollows or other asperities, reasons for the
origination of transverse currents may be sufficiently obvious. But
even if the channel face is extremely smooth, so as to present no
sensible asperities, still there is good reason to assert that transverse
flows will come to be instituted in consequence of the rapid flow of
the main body of the current      along a lamina, very thin it may be, of
water greatly deadened as to forward motion by viscid cohesion with
the channel face, and throughout and across which, if regarded as only

a fall of free level, in consequence of the surface declivity. It is thus
receiving forward acceleration in the downhill direction, and its
velocity goes on increasing until at some depth from the surface it
reaches a maximum, from whence, during further lapse of time and
further descent of this water towards the bottom, the retarding
influences imparted to it from the bottom are predominant over the
downhill accelerating influence of gravity. These retarding influences,
chiefly acting through transverse rushes of water from the bottom
 commingling more numerously and more briskly with the descending
water under consideration the more it gets into the neighbourhood of
the bottom, bring about the result that the water goes forward with
less and less velocity as it approaches nearer and nearer to the bottom.
   I have now to offer, by consideration of an imaginable case different
from that   of an ordinary river, an illustration which will aid in the
forming of clear ideas on what I have been presenting as a true theory
of the real behaviour of the water in rivers.

a layer of oil floating on the top, the   being    some such depth          oil                   of                                     as

that stage of great relative velocity, it would at an earlier stage
ruffle up the mutual face of meeting of itself and the water into pro
tuberances and hollows, somewhat like waves, on the principle referred
to already in a foot-note as having been proposed by Sir William
Thomson, and would carry this action on to the extent of causing
commotion and commingling of the water and oil. The contrast be
tween this case and that of an ordinary river of water is so remarkable
as to aid the forming of a clear comprehension of the very different
mode of action which                              I

from the bottom, or of water retarded by the influence of the river
bed, we ought to expect the forward velocity to increase from the sur
face to very nearly the bottom.      The accelerative influence of gravity
due to the surface    inclination, and more particularly due to the fall of
free-level experienced, as an accompaniment of that inclination, by the
water throughout the body of the current in its onward flow would
generate in every portion or particle of this water increase of velocity
for advance along its course; because, in the absence of rushes of
deadened water from the bed, such as it appears do commonly intrude
into the body of the current, there would be no retardative influence to

certain Japanese and Chinese mirrors of apparently reflecting from
their polished faces the raised characters on their backs.
   It was for this third reason, the interest that such mirrors have long
possessed  for the student of science, that our attention was drawn to
the subject, and it has been in this direction that our inquiry has been
chiefly directed.   The results of our investigation we propose giving
in the present  paper,  reserving for a subsequent occasion* some remarks
on the Japanese mirror as an object of worship, and the position it
holds on the toilet table of a Japanese lady.
   The mirror of the Far East is too well known to need an elaborate
description; suffice it for the present to observe that it is generally
more or less convex on the reflecting side, usually made of bronze,
polished with a mercury amalgam, and having at its back a gracefully
executed raised design, representing birds, flowers, dragons, a geo
metrical pattern, or some scene in Japanese mythical history. Occa
sionally there are in addition one or more Chinese characters (signi
fying long-life, happiness, or some similar idea) of polished metal,
in bold relief. To the method of manufacture we shall refer further
on, and especially to the mode in which the convexity of the surface
is produced; which portion of the manufacture, while playing, as it
does, an important part in the magical behaviour of the mirror, is, as
far as we are aware, not to be found described in any of the Eastern
or Western writings on the subject.
   Just before leaving England, in 1873, the attention of one of the
authors was directed to the so-called magic property of certain Eastern
mirrors by the late Sir Charles Wheatstone, who explained to him
that the Japanese had a clever trick of scratching a pattern on the
surface of a bronze mirror which, after being polished, showed no
traces of the scratches when looked at directly, but which, when used
to reflect the sunlight on to a screen, revealed the pattern as a bright
image. This opinion appears to have been shared by Sir David
 Brewster,   since he says, in the “Philosophical             Magazine” for
 December, 1832:—
   “Like all    other conjurors,     the artist has contrived to make the
observer deceive himself.       The stamped figures on the back (of the
mirror) are used for this purpose. The spectrum in the luminous area
is not an image of the figures on the back. The figures are a copy of the
picture which the artist has drawn on the face of the mirror, and so con
cealed by polishing that it is invisible in ordinary lights, and can be
brought out only in the sun's rays.”
   As the explanation, therefore, appeared to this one of the authors to
be so simple, and at the same time so complete, he practically dis
missed the subject from his mind.

   However, he was a little astonished to find, during his residence
in Japan, that, although the magic mirror was supposed in Europe
to be a standard Japanese trick, and although it had been considered
by Sir Charles Wheatstone as one of the best proofs of the ingenuity
of the workmen of Japan, still that it formed no part of the stock-in
trade of any of the numerous conjurors in this country, and was never
exposed for sale in any of the curiosity-shops. He was also still more
surprised when, during the visit of the “Challenger,” Sir Wyville
Thomson and himself were strolling about Tokio, to find that, although
they asked at several mirror shops for a mirror that showed the back,
a specimen of which Sir Wyville much desired to possess, the shop
keepers seemed not to have the slightest knowledge of what was wanted.
At that time the author could not but regard the total apparent ignorance
displayed       by the Japanese mirror-vendors on this subject        as the result     -   -
of his limited knowledge of the language, and he had then no notion
that, in Japan at any rate, the phenomenon was the result of no clever
trickery, but arose from the method in which the mirrors were pre
pared.    We have since learnt, however, by diligent inquiry, that, as
                                                                                        |   :

is the case with many things appertaining to Japan, so with the
magic mirror, the people who know least about the subject are the
Japanese themselves, and we think this only furnishes another proof                     s
that teachers to instruct the Japanese about Japan itself are the
greatest desideratum.                                                                   .
   Our attention was next directed to the subject of the curious pro
perty possessed by some Japanese mirrors by a letter from Professor
 Atkinson, of the Tokio Dai Gaku (the Imperial University), which
appeared   in “Nature,” May 24th, 1877, and in which he says, after
 referring to the phenomenon of the pattern on the back being ap
 parently reflected when sunlight is allowed to fall on the face:—
   “I   have since tried several mirrors, as sold in the shops, and in
 most cases the appearance described            has been observed with more or
 less    distinctness.”
   “I have  been unable to find a satisfactory explanation of this fact,
 but on considering  the mode of manufacture              I
                                                 was led to suppose that
 the pressure to which the mirror was subjected during polishing, and
 which is greatest  on the parts in relief, was concerned in the pro
 duction of the  figures.  On putting this to the test by rubbing the
 back of the mirror with a blunt-pointed instrument, and permitting
 the rays of the sun to be reflected from the front surface, a bright line
 appeared                                 to the position of the part
                    in the image corresponding
 rubbed.   This experiment is quite easy to repeat, a scratch with a
 knife, or with any other hard body, is sufficient. It would seem as if
   the
     pressure upon the back during polishing caused some change                    in
   *     Only   small percentage, however,
                a                          of  the total number  of Japanese mirrors
  that   the authors   of
                       this paper have experimented  on show the phenomenon  clearly.

the reflecting surface corresponding to the raised parts, whereby the
amount of light reflected was greater; or supposing that, of the light
which falls upon the surface, a part is absorbed and the rest reflected,
those parts corresponding to the raised portions on the back are
altered by the pressure in such a way that less is absorbed, and there
fore a bright image appears.”
    Professor Atkinson cautiously adds: “This, of course, is not an
                                         I
explanation of the phenomenon, but put it forward as perhaps          in
dicating the direction in which a true explanation may be looked for.”
    In vol. i. p. 242, year 1832, of the “Journal of the Asiatic Society
of Bengal,” Mr. Prinsep gives an account of a Japanese magic mirror
which he had seen in Calcutta.       He does not appear to have made any
direct experiments with this mirror for the purpose of elucidating
which of all the possible causes is the real cause of the magic pheno
mena, but rather he concludes “from analogy that the thin parts or
tympanum of the Japanese mirror are slightly convex with reference
to the rest of the reflecting surface, which may have been caused either
by the ornamental work having been stamped or partially carved with
a hammer and chisel on its back; or, which is more probable, that
part of the metal was by this stamping rendered in a degree harder
than the rest, so that in polishing it was not worn away to the same
extent.”     It does not seem to have occurred to him that Japanese
mirrors are cast and not stamped at all.
    In “Nature,” June 14th, 1877, Mr. Highley refers to the exhibition
 of a Japanese mirror by Professor Pepper some years ago at the Poly
 technic Institution, London, and to the praiseworthy attempt of an
 English brass worker, who saw the experiment, and who also was under
 the false impression that such mirrors were stamped, to solve the pro
 blem. “The workman found that taking ordinary brass and stamping
 upon its surface with any suitable die, not once, but three times in
 succession, upon exactly the same spot, grinding down and polishing
 between each act of stamping, a molecular difference was established
 between the stamped and unstamped parts, so that images of the pat
 tern could be reflected from the finally polished surface, just as with
 the Japanese specula, though no difference of surface could be detected
 with the eye.”
    To people who have not been in China or Japan, and personally
 studied mirror-making, this idea of stamping seems very plausible, for
 Sir David Brewster, on p. 113 et seq. of his “Letters on Natural Magic,”
 published in 1842, describes fully a method, depending on the mole
 cular change produced by stamping, by means of which the inscrip
 tions on old coins, that have been worn quite smooth, may be deciphered.
 This method merely consists in heating the coin on a piece of red-hot
 iron, when the inscription becomes visible from the different rate of
 oxidation of the part of the coin that has been subjected to great

pieces, and that he has thus ascertained for himself the truth of this
explanation.                                 -
   In a recent interesting article published in No. 29 of the “Garten
laube,” Heft 8, 1877, by the well-known German popular writer whose
nom-de-plume is Carus Sterne, doubt is thrown on the above explanation,
since Herr Sterne thinks the magic mirror he himself possesses is too
thin for any such inlaying to have been performed. In quoting the infor
mation given by M. Julien, to which reference is made above, he inci
dentally mentions that it is taken from the fifty-sixth volume of the
Chinese encyclopaedia called “Ke-chi-king-youen.” Herr Sterne adds
that these magic mirrors were known to the Chinese from the earliest
times, and that one of their writers spoke about them in the ninth
century of the Christian era. He remarks that the Roman writer

paper on the subject, by Professor Harting, appeared some years ago

 has a most extensive acquaintance  with the literature bearing on that
country, informs me no explanation of the phenomenon was contained

   Japanese literature, as already mentioned, appears to be quite barren
of information regarding their own or the Chinese mirrors which
 appear to reflect their backs.         But in the shim-pen-kamakura-shi,              or
“New Collection of Writings about Kamakura,” it is mentioned that
 in the temple Kenchoji, situated in the ancient capital of the Shogun,”
 there is treasured up a wonderful old mirror, 3% suns high and 3 suns
 wide,t which, when looked at somewhat obliquely, shows the image of
    * Shogun, the military usurper of the throne of Japan, and      recognizedin modern
 times prior to the revolution of 1869 as the rightful sovereign.      He was sometimes
 erroneously called the Tycoon.

 a Buddhist god.          This appearance, however, is in no way connected
 with the pattern at the back, which consists of a new moon reflected
 in the sea; the artistic balance of the picture being maintained by a
 rosary and a plum tree. The hole in the upper portion of the mirror
 is probably for the attachment of a silk cord to hang it up by.
 The supposed marvellous character of this mirror causes great reve
 rence to be shown to the god of the temple, as it is considered to
furnish an undoubted proof of his supernatural character; in fact, the
 mirror receives nearly as much respect as this Buddhist deity himself.
    The way in which the optical effect has been produced is said to be
the same as that described in the Kokon-i-to, “The Genealogy of the
Old and New Physicians,” and which is as follows:–Take ten parts
of shio (gamboge), one of funso, and one of hosha (borax). Powder
these thoroughly, and mix them to the consistency of a paste with a
little dilute glue. If any pattern be drawn on the surface of the
mirror with this paste, and then allowed to dry, the pattern will be
seen, even after polishing, if looked at obliquely.
    A mirror, in the face of which was seen the appearance of the
famous priest, Shinran-sho-nin, who instituted the Shinshiu religion,
to which the Honguangi temples at Kioto belong, was formerly in the
possession of the Kuge" Rokujo, and was, to a certain extent, wor
shipped.     Wood-cuts of this mirror were also sold at this nobleman's
house, and were regarded as a faithful representation of the priest
Shinran-sho-nin. One of the persons formerly employed at the Hon
guangi temples, Kioto, tells us he remembers, some years ago, a
messenger, coming from Mr. Rokujo, asking that the authorities of
the temple would give a certificate, stating that the mirror had been
constructed by Shinran-sho-nin himself for holy purposes. This, how
ever, they declined to do, believing rather that Mr. Rokujo had fabri
cated it himself to obtain money on exhibition.             Mr. Rokujo, to whom
we have     applied      on the   subject,  says, that the old tradition in his
family was that the mirror originally came from Echigo it also that,
after the failure to obtain a certificate of its sanctity referred to above,
he sold it to a temple situated near Kioto, from which, however, it
was subsequently removed, and that he is quite unacquainted                    with
its present whereabouts.
    A Tokiot     mirror maker, however, tells us that he has seen an exactly
similar mirror at Okasaki-mura, a small village near Kioto, so perhaps
this is the present habitation of Mr. Rokujo's old mirror.

has ever been employed    in Japan to alter a portion of the surface in
such a way that this part becomes visible in the image formed by re
flection, although invisible when looked at directly. A certain Tokio
mirror maker, however, said that he had employed the chemical
method for this purpose in the following                                way:
   Coat the surface of the mirror with urushi (Japanese varnish), with
the exception of the portion that it is desired shall cast the brighter
reflection, then act on this part with a paste composed of equal parts
of sulphur and copper sulphate, powdered and mixed with shiro-umedzu
(white plum acid). If this paste, after being allowed to dry on the
mirror, which takes about two days, be rubbed off, and the mirror be
frequently polished, the pattern (so said this mirror maker) will

  This difference in molecular           constitution       might produce              the   re
sults:—
  a. By causing the portion of the face corresponding with the pattern
at the back to attract more mercury, and so to become capable of
being polished more easily; or
  b. By causing it to be harder, and so to acquire a better polish; or
  c. By causing it to polarise light.
  This difference in molecular constitution might be produced:—
  a. By the inlaying of another metal; or
  b. By portions of the surface being acted on chemically; or
  c. By unequal density produced by inequality in the rate of
cooling; but
   d. Not by stamping, Japanese mirrors being all cast.
   3. The phenomenon might arise from the face of the mirror having
intentional or accidental inequalities on its surface, in consequence of
which, the part corresponding with the pattern on the back might be
relatively concave, and so concentrate the light, or, at any rate, might
disperse it less than the remainder of the slightly convex mirror.
   The question then resolves itself into considering to which of these
three groups of causes is the apparent reflection of the back in some
Japanese mirrors due.
   To ascertain this, we tried Sir David. Brewster's suggestion that
the light reflected by the thicker part of the mirror was polarised;
but even with a fairly good polariscope, we could detect no marked
difference between the light reflected from the various portions of the
surface.   This failing, we availed ourselves of a very simple method
of  experimenting,  but one that has apparently not suggested itself to
previous observers. On one occasion, when some of our students
were using lenses to endeavour to make the exhibition of the pheno
menon more striking, it occurred to us that the employment of beams
of light of different degrees of convergence or divergence would fur
nish a test for deciding the cause of the whole action. For while, if
the phenomenon were due to molecular differences in the surface, the
effect would be practically independent of the amount of convergence
of the beam of light; on the other hand, if it were due to portions of
the reflecting surface being less convex than the remainder, a com
plete inversion of the phenomenon might be expected to occur, if the
experiment, instead of being tried in ordinary sunlight, were made
under certain conditions in a converging beam—that              the thickeris,
portions    ofthe mirror might        be

AB       and BC of the mirror              be about equal to one another, the amount

areas DE and EF are about equal, they will be equally                         bright.        But   if

the point S. But if we now turn to fig. 3, where the light is con
verging to a point behind the convex surface, and nearer to the sur
face than half the radius of the mirror, then, after reflection, the light
converges to a point O in front of the mirror, and, as before, the area
GH (which has become almost a point, G) is smaller, and therefore
brighter, than the area DE, as long as the screen is nearer to the mirror
than the point P, but larger, and therefore darker, than D'E', when
the screen is farther from the mirror than P. In other words, if the
phenomenon of the Japanese mirror is due to the curvature of different
parts of the surface being slightly different, then with the arrange

ment of light shown in fig. 3, the whole effect                     ought to undergo an
inversion as the screen passes through P; that                     is to say,   if the parts
corresponding with the pattern at the back are                     the flatter,  then, while
these should appear as bright on a dark ground   when the screen is at
a position DF, they ought to appear as dark on a bright ground when
the screen is at a position D'F". Now this is exactly what is found to
be the case when tested experimentally.

screen be held very near to the mirror, the apparent reflection of the
back, the magical property in fact, ought to become invisible.    And
this, also, is exactly what happens when we make the screen almost
touch the polished surface.
   We have, therefore, strong reasons for favouring the “inequality of
curvature” theory.       In order, however, to make the explanation
quite certain, we have had made a small concavity and a small con
vexity on the face of one of the mirrors, by hammering with a blunt
tool, carefully protected with a soft cushion to avoid scratching the
polished surface, and, as is seen on trying the experiment, the con
cavity reflects a bright image and the convexity a dark one when the
screen is in the position DF, but when the screen is shifted to D'F', it
is the convexity which appears as the bright spot, and the concavity
as the dark one.
   And not only do we think that the thicker portions of the convex
mirror are flatter than the remainder, but the existence of a focus for
a divergent pencil (as evidenced by a best position of the screen in
fig. 2) leads to the conclusion that, in some instances at any rate, the
thicker portion is actually concave, and is found to have a radius of
about three to four metres.
  In the account of the Chinese Magic mirror, given by Ou-tseu-hing
at the end of the thirteenth century, he mentions that the wall or
screen on which the shadow is cast should be near, an instruction                  -
which people have usually found it necessary to follow in order to see        *>           f
the phenomenon       clearly. But this condition of proximity of the
screen to the mirror is necessary, simply because the sunlight falling
on the mirror neither forms a parallel beam, nor one diverging from,
nor converging to, a single point, but consists, of course, of an
enormous number of slightly diverging beams.        Consequently, on any
one  point of the mirror there fall rays of light, each making a slightly
                                                                                           s
                                                                                       •
different angle with the surface.    Now,  as these, after reflection, pro-
ceed in slightly different directions, they will illuminate different
points of the screen, and, therefore, make a well-defined image impos
sible, unless the screen be held near. If ordinary sunlight then be
employed, the screen, as previously explained, must be held not so near
the mirror that the inequalities of the surface are unable to produce
any decided displacement of the rays before they strike the screen,
and in addition, as we now see, not so far from the mirror that the
different rays falling on the same point are perceptibly separated before
they reach the screen;    or,
                          putting the above conditions into more pre
cise mathematical language, the screen must not        be

far from the mirror that the product   of   this distance into the angular
diameter of the sun  istoo large.

    This condition, however, of proximity of the screen to the mirror
 ceases to have any weight, and the phenomenon can be shown to a
 large audience by projecting it on a distant wall if one or other of the
 following devices be adopted:—
    1. Allow the sunlight to first pass through a small hole, so that all
 the rays falling on the same point of the surface of the mirror make
 the same angle with the surface.
    2. Obtain the same result thus:—first let the sunlight fall on a
 convex lens or on a concave mirror which brings it to a focus, and
 afterwards causes it to diverge from a single point, then hold the
 Japanese mirror in the diverging beam at about eight or more feet
 from the principal focus of the lens or auxiliary concave mirror.
    3. Illuminate the mirror with light diverging from a single bright
 point at some distance, as, for example, from an electric light at the
 other end of the room, the screen, of course, being shaded from the
direct light of the lamp.
                                   FIG. 4.
    4. Allow the sun's rays to fall on the nearly plane Japanese mirror
MM, and after reflection let them pass through a converging lens so
adjusted that the screen RR, fig. 4, is beyond the principal focus, P, of
the mirror and lens combined, and also beyond     JJ, the conjugate focus
of the mirror, that is the place at which the image of the Japanese
mirror is formed by the lens.
    The last method causes the effect to be better than that obtained
with ordinary sunlight alone, because the insertion of the lens
separates the rays falling on different points of the Japanese mirror
more than it separates those which, coming from different points of
the sun, are reflected in different directions by the same small portion
of the Japanese mirror.     In fact, the employment of the lens corrects,

the light best, and if the screen is distant, may be employed to pro
duce a large figure of the pattern on the back of the mirror, but the
result is not nearly as beautiful as that obtained by either of the
former three methods, the first two in particular of which, if the
mirror is placed in a darkened room, at about fourteen feet distance
from the luminous point produced by a tropical sun, cause the reflec
tion on the wall to assume an appearance startling even to an educated
mind, and which might well have brought to the feet of the magician
the ignorant poor of the middle ages.
  Referring to the arrangement of mirror and lens shown in fig. 4,
and remembering the reasoning employed in the case of figs. 1, 2, and
3, we should    conclude that if a portion, AB, of the mirror is more
concave than the rest, this portion ought to appear as bright on a
dark ground if the screen be held in the positions 1, 2, or 4, since, in               -
all these, DE is less than CD or EF, but if it be held at any point, 3
in the region between the principal focus P and       JJ,then, since here
 DE is greater than CD or EF, the concave portion ought to appear as
dark on a relatively light ground, while at        JJ, the image being                .
uniformly illuminated, the appearance of the pattern ought to dis
 appear altogether.   We should expect, then, that the passage of the
 screen, either through P or through     JJ,
                                           ought to produce an inversion
                                                                                  |    -  :

   Again, imagine the lens LL to gradually move up to the mirror
 until it attains a very near position, as in fig. 5, then an inspection of
 the direction of the rays shows that any concave part, AB, of the
                                                                         be all

 in the region beyond P. On arranging the light as in fig. 4, and
 placing the screen successively in the positions 1, 2, 3,       JJ,  and 4.
 afterwards moving the lens up to the Japanese mirror, until the
 distance between it and the mirror was less than the focal length of
 the lens, we found that the experiments bore out, in every detail,
the results that must follow from the “inequality of curvature
 theory.”
    Returning now to fig. 3, in which it was first shown that a con
 verging beam produced an inversion of the phenomenon, we find it
 impossible to obtain a distinct dark image of the pattern on a light
 ground by the employment of one converging lens only. This is
 partly due to the fact that here we are dealing with diverging pencils
 of light falling on the screen, so that no true image of the pattern is
 formed; and partly caused by the blurring effect arising from a beam of
sunlight, consisting of a number of slightly diverging pencils.         This
 latter may be, to a certain extent, corrected, either by allowing a very
 small beam of sunlight to fall on the single converging lens, or by
causing the sunlight to be brought first to a focus by one lens, and
 then with a second lens at several feet distance, forming another con
vergent pencil of light, in which the convergent mirror is placed.
    Guided by all that proceeds, we are led to the undoubted conclusion,
that the third of the proposed explanations is the correct one, namely,
that the whole action of the magic mirror arises from the thicker
portions being flatter than the remaining convex surface, and even
being sometimes actually concave.
    The next question arises, why is there this difference in the curvature
of the different portions of the surface? The experience that one
gains from an examination of a large number of Japanese mirrors
supplies, in part at any rate, the answer to the question.         Nothick
mirror reflects the pattern on the back, not one of the many beautiful
mirrors exhibited at the National Exhibition of Japan in 1877, and
which we were so fortunate as to be able to experiment with in a
darkened room with a bright luminous point at some twelve feet dis
tance, shows the phenomenon in the slightest degree; some good old
mirrors in the museum of the Imperial College of Engineering, and
which belonged to the family of the late Emperor, the Shogun, of
Japan, fail to reflect any trace of a design, and some old round mirrors
without handles, which we have also tried, are, with the exception of
one about six inches in radius, and for which the owner asked many
pounds, equally unsuccessful.     Now this in itself, independently of the
erroneous idea   regarding  stamping,  is almost sufficient to negative Mr.
Prinsep's idea “that part of the metal was by this stamping rendered
in a degree harder than the rest, so that in polishing it was not worn
away to the same extent.”      Again, it is not that the pattern is less
clearly executed on the backs of these choice mirrors, since the better

the mirror the finer and bolder is the pattern, but what is especially
noticeable is that every one of these mirrors is as a whole far thicker
than an ordinary Japanese mirror, and its surface is much less convex.
This naturally led us to inquire, how are Japanese mirrors made con
vex P are they cast so, or do they acquire this shape from some subse
quent process? In the article “Miroirs” in “Les Industries Anciennes
et Modernes de l'Empire Chinois,” nothing is said on this point, and
the paper communicated by M. Julien on the Chinese Magic Mirror to
the French Academy, is equally silent on this subject.                               Professor
Pepper says, “Are the mirrors cast in a double mould one side of                               .
which is in intaglio and one side in relievo *" but has no information
by which he can answer this question.                        We also were quite unable to
gain any assistance from foreign or from Japanese books or manu
scripts regarding the method by which the convexity observed in
almost all Japanese mirrors is produced, and were consequently com
pelled to make inquiries ourselves among mirror makers. Now although
                                                                                                 !
shops where mirrors are sold are common enough in Tokio, workshops
where they are made are very difficult to find.                          A workshop was said        -.
to exist at Oji,  but after a           long      search in this suburb of Tokio we
found only one old woman and a little mercury amalgam in a small
hovel about six feet by four, as the representative of the mirror in
dustry. As women are supposed to know nothing in Japan, it was
                                                                                                 :: .
useless to make inquiries of her: another search made on a subsequent                            g
occasion in a different direction only elicited the information that mirrors
were not made at that time of the year, as the moulds were frost
bitten.   Mirror-sellers, mirror-polishers we could find, but nobody in
Tokio seemed to cast mirrors. We have since found out that this is
really the case, since all the common mirrors come from the ancient
capital Kioto, about 400 miles to the south of Tokio, and it is only
when some special order is given that mirrors are made in the capital.
However, at last we lighted on some mirror makers and sellers com
bined, from whom Mr. Kawaguchi (one of the assistants to the Pro
fessor of Natural Philosophy at our College), in the course of many
conversations,   extracted much valuable information.                         As a large por
tion of this is not to be          found,       as far as we         aware, in any books, and
as it bears upon the explanation of the magic mirror given in this
paper, it naturally finds a place here.

lead comes to the surface and spoils the mixture.   Zinc he also finds
has the same effect.  But as a small amount of lead is required to be
inserted   in the composition to prevent the metal from becoming too
brittle, the shirome or sulphide of lead and antimony is employed.
The chief sources of this shirome arranged in order of merit are the
provinces in the south of Japan, called—

but the shirome coming from the last province, Tosa, cannot be used
for mirrors, as it contains too much lead.                                               *

absence of both tin and the Iyo shirome in the composition of the
 fifth quality is found to make the mirrors give a pale reflection, from
 the difficulty of amalgamation, and so the fifth composition is not            s  .
 often used.
     The composition for the common mirrors is made at the copper mines
 and forwarded to the various mirror foundries.      Formerly the metal        :
 for mirrors was extensively prepared at Kioto, but the trade is dying
 out now, and is said to have been slowly diminishing for the last
  hundred and thirty years, at the commencement of which period it
 had reached    its maximum.
   Moulds for Mirrors.—The most striking feature of the moulds is that
 while practically all Japanese mirrors are conver, the surface of each half
 of the mould is quite flat. The material used for making the mould is a
 mixture of a special kind of clay (found near Tokio and Osaka) with
 water and straw-ash.      Two suitable slabs having been formed from
 this plastic compound    with the aid of wooden frames, a thick layer of
 half liquid mixture of powdered old crucibles, or of a fine powder
 called to-no-ko, made from a soft kind of whetstone, is spread on them.
 The design for the back of the mirror is then cut directly on one half
 of the mould, or a sketch drawn on paper is first stuck on and used as
 a guide in cutting the design in the clay.  Sometimes, but rarely, the
 design is stamped in the clay with a pattern wood-block cut in relief
 like the proposed back of the mirror. After the design is complete a
 rim of the same material as that used in the construction of the mould,
  and  having a thickness equal to that desired for the mirror, is attached
  to one half of the mould. The two halves are then dried in the smoke
  of a pine tree fire, pressed and tied together, and laid in the casting

which the design has been cut being uppermost. Finally, the molten
speculum metal is run into a number of moulds at the same time.

which, when cold, are broken up and the castings removed.
  Mirrors cast in a mould, in which the design has been cut by hand,
are called ichi mai buki, “mould used once,” and are regarded as
“artists’ proofs,” as the design on the back is well defined. To form
subsequent moulds the two halves are pressed, when the clay is wet,
on an ichi mai buki mirror, and the pattern is this way transferred,
but the designs on the backs of the mirrors cast in such moulds are
not as clear as on an ichi mai buki mirror, which therefore sells for a
much higher price.
  Curving the Surface.—The rough mirror is first scraped approxi
mately smooth with a hand-scraping tool, and as this would remove
any small amount of convexity, had such been imparted to it in cast
ing, it is useless to make the mould slightly convex.      however,                            If,                  a

and to cause the face to present a smooth surface for the subsequent
polishing.
   In the     case of thick mirrors the convexity is first made by     cutting
with a   knife,    and the “distorting rod.” applied afterwards.        But in
connection with this cutting process of thick mirrors there             is one
very interesting point.        If the maker finds on applying from     time to
time the face of the mirror to a hard        clay concave   pattern, and turn
ing it round under a little pressure, that a portion of the surface has
not been in contact with the pattern, in other words, that he has cut
away this portion too much, then he rubs this spot round and round
with the megebo until he has restored the required degree of convexity.
Here again then scratching on the surface produces convexity.
   Now, why does the scraping of the “distorting rod” across the face
of the mirror leave it convex P During the operation it is visibly
concave. The metal must receive then a kind of “buckle,” and spring
back again so as to become convex when the pressure of the rod is
 removed.       It might in such a case reasonably be expected that the
thicker   parts    of the mirror would yield less to the pressure of the rod
 than the    thinner,   and so would be made less convex, or even they might   :
 not spring back, on the withdrawal of the rod, and so remain actually
concave.       Again, since we find that scraping the face of a mirror is
the   way   in which it is made convex, and the back therefore concave,
 we might conclude that a deep scratch on the back would make the
back convex and the face slightly concave. Such a concavity, as we
 have proved, would explain the phenomenon of the bright line appear
 ing in the reflection of sunlight on the screen which was observed by
 Professor Atkinson to correspond with the scratch on the back.
    It appears then that the magic of the Eastern mirror results from
 no subtle trick on the part of the maker, from no inlaying of other
 metals, or hardening of portions by stamping, but merely arises from
the natural property possessed by thin bronze of buckling under a
bending stress, so as to remain strained in the opposite direction
after the stress is removed. And this stress is applied partly by the
 “distorting rod,” and partly by the subsequent polishing, which, in an
 exactly similar way, tends to make the thinner parts more convex than
                                                          -
 the thicker.
    Polishing.—After the scratches produced by the megebo are removed
 the   mirror     is first polished with a whetstone called either iyodo,
 “whetstone      from the province of Iyo,” or shiroto, “white whetstone.”
 Afterwards a whetstone called tenshimado, “whetstone from the pro
 vince Tsushima,” or the powder to-no-ko, previously described, is used.
 Thirdly, a piece of charcoal, prepared from the ho tree (Magnolia
 hypoleuca) is rubbed over the surface.         The face now becomes fairly
 smooth, but it still generally contains some few cavities; these the
 maker   fills up from    a stock  of copper balls of various sizes which he

has at hand, and which are obtained from the cinders of a copper
furnace.  The cavities when thus filled up are well rubbed so as to
escape notice, but they may usually be detected by looking at the
mirror obliquely.
  It was perhaps the presence of these bits of copper in the mirror
which Ou-tseu-hing saw broken up in the 13th century, that misled
him into concluding that the phenomenon of the magic mirror was
produced by the inlaying of denser copper in a portion of the face
exactly corresponding with the design on the back.

according to the analysis of MM. Champion and Pellet (“Industries

brush or with the hand. The mirror is finally wiped clean with a soft
kind of paper, mino-gami, “paper from the province Mino,” which is con
sidered to scratch the surface less than silk.    Leather was formerly
never  employed   in polishing, as it would have been considered im
pious to pollute so holy a thing as a mirror by touching it with
the skin of an animal; for under the old feudal system in Japan,
workers in skins, saddlers, and others, belonged to the Eta or pariah
class.
   When mirrors  possessed by private people require brightening up,
in consequence  of the surface tarnishing, the paste produced when
razors are sharpened on a home is usually rubbed over the face of the
mirror.
III. “On      the Torsional Strain which remains in a Glass Fibre

        D.Sc., F.R.S. Received October 4, 1878.
   It has long been known that if a wire of metal or fibre of glass be
for a time twisted, and be then released, it will not at once return to
 itsinitial position, but will exhibit gradually decreasing torsion

Boltzmann (“Akad. der Wissensch. Wien,” 1874).                        He rests his
theory upon the assumption that stress acting for
                                          a                       a   short time will

leave after    it has  ceased a  strain which decreases in amount        as time
elapses, and that the principle of superposition is applicable to these
strains, that is to say, that we may add the after-effects of stresses,
whether simultaneous or successive. Boltzmann also finds that, if
 p(t)'t be the strain at time t resulting from      a twist lasting a very short
time T, at time   t-0,            , where  A  is constant for moderate values
                        o()=#
of t, but decreases when      t is very large   or very small. A year ago       I
made a few experiments         on a   glass fibre which showed a deviation
from Boltzmann's law. A paper on this subject by Kohlrausch (“Pogg.
Ann.,” 1876) suggested using the results of these experiments to exa
mine how Boltzmann's law must be modified to express them.                  Pro
fessor Kohlrausch's results indicate that in the cases of silver wire and
 of fibre of caoutchouc Boltzmann's principle of superposition is only
 approximate, and that in the case of a short duration of twisting

       =#.
 twisting   he uses other formulae, which pretty successfully express his
 results, owing in part no doubt to the fact that in most cases each
 determination of the constants applies only to the results of one dura
 tion of twisting.     In a case like the present it appears best to adopt a
 simple form involving constants for the material only, and then see in
 what way it fails to express the varying conditions of experiment. In
 1865 Sir W. Thomson published (“Proceedings of the Royal Society”)
 the results of some experiments on the viscosity of metals, the method
 being to determine the rate at which the amplitude of torsional vibra
 tions subsided.      One of the results was that if the wire were kept
 vibrating for some time it exhibited much greater viscosity than when
 it had long been quiescent. This should guard us from expecting to
 attain great uniformity in experiments so       -
                                                   roughly conducted as those
 of the present paper.
    2. The glass fibre examined was about 20 inches in length.                Its
 diameter, which might vary somewhat from point to point, was
 not measured.       The glass from which it was drawn was composed
 of silica, soda, and lime; in fact, was glass No. 1 of my paper on
 “Residual       Charge of the Leyden Jar” (“Phil. Trans,” 1877.
 In all cases the twist given was one complete revolution. The de
 flection at any time was determined by the position on a scale of the
 image of a wire before a lamp, formed by reflection from a light con
 cave mirror, as in Sir W. Thomson's galvanometers and quadrant elec
 trometer.    The extremities of the fibre were held in clamps of cork;
 in the first attempts the upper clamp was not disturbed during the
 experiment, and the upper extremity of the fibre was assumed to be
 fixed; the mirror also was attached to the lower clamp. This arrange
 ment was unsatisfactory, as one could not be certain that a part of the

observed after-effect was not due to the fibre twisting within the
clamps and then sticking. The difficulty was easily avoided by em
ploying two mirrors, each cemented at a single point to the glass fibre
itself, one just below the upper clamp, the other just above the lower
clamp. The upper mirror merely served by means of a subsidiary
lamp and scale to bring back the part of the fibre to which it was
attached to its initial position. The motion of the lower clamp was
damped by attaching to it a vane dipping into a vessel of oil.  The
temperature of the room when the experiments were tried ranged from
13° C. to 13.8°C, and for the present purpose may be regarded as
constant.   The lower or reading scale had forty divisions to the inch,
and was distant from the glass fibre and mirror 38% inches, excepting
in Experiment V, when it was at 37' inches. Sufficient time elapsed
between the experiments to allow all sign of change due to after-effect
of torsion to disappear. In     cases the first line  all

  It should   be mentioned that the operation of putting on the twist
and of   releasing  each occupied about two seconds,      and was per
formed half in the second before the epoch t = 0, and half in the
second after or as nearly so as could be managed. The time was
taken by ear from a clock beating seconds very distinctly.
   3. The first point to be ascertained from these results is whether or
not the principle of superposition, assumed by Boltzmann, holds for
torsions of the magnitude here used.                                                                                                     -

        F.R.S. Received October 9, 1878.
     In my paper read 20th June last, and published in the “Journal
 of the Royal Society,” there is an error in p. 450 which          I wish to
 correct.
     Referring to the geometrical proof of Mr. Darwin's theorem, stateI
 that from cusp to cusp of the cycloidal wabble occupies 152 days;
 this is an error, as it should be 305 days, as can be shown geometri
 cally.
    Let  ya!, y'a', be two successive positions of the line joining the axes
 of rotation and figure; produce them to meet at C, which will be the
centre of curvature, because ya and y'a', are normals to the cycloidal
arc yy'; it is well known that yC, (radius of curvature) is double yx
 (chord of generating circle) or double y'r; therefore the angle yxy'
is double the angle yCy'; but yay' measures the angular velocity of
the wabble, when x is supposed at rest; therefore the angular velocity
of yx is only half that of the wabble, if the axis of figure were at rest.
Hence in 305 days, ya      will turn through   180° only, and not 360°.

    This correction, when introduced into my calculation of Mr. Dar
win's problem, p. 182, will double the result, and give 19,350 years
to represent the 19,200 years, found by Mr. Darwin.
    I  would wish to add, that Mr. Darwin, in a letter to myself, pro
poses to call the cycloidal wabble described by him, a “lopsided
wabble,” as distinguished from the simple circular “wabble” described
by me; the one being caused by continuous motion of the axis of
figure, and the other      caused by sudden displacement         of that axis.

    A paper of mine with the above title was communicated to the Royal
 Society by Professor J. Clerk Maxwell, F.R.S., on March 9th, 1878.                    s
 It was read on March 28th, and an abstract of it appeared in the .                  :
 “Proceedings.”
     In  the course of the summer it was pointed out to me that owing to
 a mistake in the formula of calculation all the results were wrong.              I,
 therefore, requested permission to withdraw my paper, in order to re
 calculate the results.      The new values of K arrived at led me to make
 some determinations of refractive indices and to re-write the theoretical
 deductions at the close of the paper.
     I  now beg through Professor Maxwell to present the paper in an
 amended form, in the hope that it may be found not entirely unworthy
 of the attention of the Royal Society.
     As it would be impossible within the limits of an abstract to give
 any intelligible account of the new method of experiment (due to Pro
  fessor Maxwell), which has been employed,            I will merely give the table
 of   results, reserving  all discussion and      explanation

 tion of my paper in full.
     I  may, however, state that the method is a zero method, that the
  electrified metal plates never touch the dielectrics, and that the elec
  trification, which is produced by an induction coil, has an electromo
  tive force equal to that of about 2,050 chloride of silver cells, and is
  reversed some 12,000 times per second.

    The following table compares the refractive indices of the transpa
rent dielectrics with the square roots of the specific inductive capacities.
In cases where there is a wide difference u is taken from books on
physics; wherever there was a close agreement it was carefully deter
mined by the author, except in the case of paraffin, where the value is
that given in Maxwell's “Electricity.”
   * Messrs. Gibson and Barclay, “Phil. Trans,” 1871, using a method entirely
different from mine, obtained K=1977 for paraffin. Correcting for a slight difference
of density,   I  find that if they had used my paraffin their result would have been
19833.
   t I am   not quite certain of the accuracy of this result.

  It is known to many Fellows of the Society that   have for the last                      I
four years been engaged upon  the preparation of a map  of the solar
spectrum on a large scale, the work including a comparison of the
Fraunhofer lines with those visible in the spectrum of the vapour of
each of the metallic elements in the electric arc.
   To give an idea of the thoroughness of the work, at     events    in                        all

The Hypothesis that the Elements are Simple Bodies does not include                           all

   The final reduction of the photographs                      of all the metallic elements
in the   region    39–40—a reduction            I began       in the early part of the pre
sent year, and which has taken six months, summarised all the obser
vations of metallic spectra compared with the Fraunhofer lines accu
mulated during the whole period of observation.                             Now this reduction
has shown me that the hypothesis that identical lines in different
spectra are due to impurities is not sufficient.                         I shall show in detail
in a  subsequent         paper   the    hopeless   confusion in which               I  have been
landed.      I limit myself on the present occasion to giving tables show
ing how the hypothesis deals with the spectra of iron and titanium.
   We find short-line coincidences              between many metals the impurities
of which have been             eliminated,    or in which the freedom from mutual
impurity has been demonstrated by the absence of the longest lines.

   It is  five years since         I  first pointed out that there are many facts

   160          Mr. J. N. Lockyer.         Researches   in Spectrum     [Dec. 12,
  and many trains of thought suggested by solar and stellar physics
  which point to another hypothesis, namely, that the elements themselves,
  or at all events some of them, are compound bodies.
     In a letter written to M. Dumas, December 3, 1873, and printed
  in the Comptes Rendus, Ithus summarised a memoir which has since
  appeared in the Philosophical Transactions.
        Il
     * semble que plus une étoile est chaude plus son spectre est
  simple, et que les éléments métalliques se            font voir dans l'ordre de
  leurs poids atomiques.*
     * Ainsi nous avons :
     * 1.   Des étoiles très-brillantes où nous ne voyons que l'hydrogène,
  en quantité énorme, et le magnésium ;

  dans ces étoiles, pas de métalloïdes ;
     *3. Des étoiles plus froides encore dans lesquelles tous les éléments mé
  talliques sont AssocIÉs, où leurs lignes ne sont plus visibles, et où nous
  n'avons que les spectres des métalloïdes et des composés.
     *4. Plus une étoile est âgée, plus l'hydrogène libre disparaît; sur la
  terre, nous ne trouvons plus d'hydrogène en liberté.
       Il
     * me semble que ces faits sont les preuves de plusieurs idées émises
  par vous.      J'ai pensé    que nous pouvions imaginer une * dissociation
  céleste,'  qui continue le travail de nos fourneaux, et que les métalloïdes
  sont des composés qui sont dissociés par la température solaire, pendant
  que les éléments métalliques monatomiques, dont les poids atomiques
  sont les moindres, son précisément ceux qui résistent, même à la tem
  pérature des étoiles les plus chaudes."
     Before    I proceed further,     I should state that while observations of
  the sun have since shown that calcium should be introduced between
  hydrogen and magnesium for that luminary, Dr. Huggins' photographs
  have demonstrated the same fact for the stars, so that in the present

  Following out these views, I some time since communicated a paper
to the Society on the spectrum of calcium, to which I shall refer more
expressly in the sequel.
 Differentiation of the               Phenomena          to be observed on the Two Hypotheses.
  When the reductions of the observations made on metallic spectra,
on the hypothesis that the elements were really elementary, had landed
me in the state of utter confusion to which      have already referred,       I                                      I
at once made  up  my  mind to   try  the other  hypothesis, and therefore
at once sought for a critical differentiation  of the phenomena on the
two hypotheses.
    Obviously the first thing to                        be done was to                 inquire whether one
hypothesis would explain these short-line coincidences which remained
after the reduction of all the observations on the other.   Calling for
simplicity’s sake the short lines common to many spectra basic lines,
the new hypothesis, to be of any value, should present us with a state
of things in which basic molecules representing bases of the so-called
elements should give us their lines, varying in intensity from one
condition to another, the conditions representing various compoundings.
  Suppose A to contain B as an impurity and as an element, what
will be the difference in the spectroscopic result?
  A in both cases will have a spectrum of         own;                    its
    B   as
         an impurity  will add     lines accordingits  the amount    im           to                        of
purity,      as
              have shown
              I              previous papers.

    B    an element will add its lines according
        as                                           the amount   disso           to                     of
ciation,      as
              have also shown.

   The difference      the phenomena, therefore, will
                              in                              that, with                        be
 gradually-increasing temperature, the spectrum        will fade,                  of  A                  if  it    be
a compound body,         will   increasingly dissociated, and

              Application of these Considerations to Known Compounds.
   Now to apply this reasoning to the dissociation of a known corn
pound body into its elements—
   A compound body, such as a salt of calcium, has as definite a
spectrum as a simple one; but while the spectrum of the metal itself
consists of lines, the number and thickness of some of which increase
with increased quantity, the spectrum of the compound consists in the
main of channelled spaces and bands, which increase in like manner.
   In short, the molecules of a simple body and a compound one are
affected in the same manner by quantity in so far as their spectra are
concerned;    in other words, both spectra have their long and short lines,
the lines in the spectrum of the element being represented by bands
or fluted lines in the spectrum of the compound; and in each case
the greatest simplicity of the spectrum depends upon the smallest
quantity, and the greatest complexity (a continuous spectrum) upon
the greatest.
   The heat required to act upon such a compound as a salt of calcium
so as to render       its spectrum visible, dissociates the compound according
     its   volatility; the number        true metallic lines which thus appear
                                                 of of
to
is   a   measure        of the quantity     the metal resulting from the dissocia
tion, and          as   the metal lines increase    number, the compound bands
                                                               in
thin out.
I        have shown          in   previous papers how we have been                                led   to   the   con
clusion that binary compounds have spectra     their own, and how            of
this idea has been established                      by
                               considerations having for  basis the                                     a

  “How far this     and similar variations between photographic records

which up to the present time                     I
                                  have been unable to discuss.
                                     An      Objection       Discussed.
  I was  careful at the very commencement of this paper to point out
that the conclusions             I
                        have advanced are based upon the analogies
furnished by those bodies which, by common consent and beyond
cavil and discussion, are compound bodies.     Indeed, had     not been                             I
careful to urge  this point the remark   might have been made that the
                                                                  I
various changes in the spectra to which shall draw attention are not
the results of successive dissociations, but are effects due to putting
 the same  mass into different kinds of vibration or of producing the                                                i
vibration in different ways. Thus the many high notes, both true
and false, which can be produced out of a bell with or without its
 fundamental one, might have been put forward as analogous with those
 spectral lines which are produced at different degrees of temperature
 with or without the line, due to each substance when vibrating visibly
  with the lowest temperature.   To this argument, however, if it were
 brought forward, the reply would be that it proves too much.         it                                   If
 demonstrates        that the h hydrogen line in the sun is produced by the
 same        molecular grouping of hydrogen as that which gives us two
 green       lines only when the weakest possible spark is taken in hydrogen
 inclosed          in a large glass globe, it also proves that calcium is identical
 with        its
         salts.  For we can get the spectrum    any     the salts alone     of         of
 without             its
              common base,  calcium,       can get  the green lines
                                                             as   we                                            of
 hydrogen without the red one.

of the   basiclines actually observed, the inquiry seemed worthy of
being carried to a further stage.
  The next point            I
                       considered was to obtain a clear mental view of
the manner in   which, on the principle of evolution, various bases might
now be  formed,  and then become basic themselves.
  It   did not seem unnatural that the bases should increase their                  com
plexity by a process of continual multiplication, the factor being 1, 2.
or even 3, if conditions were available under which the temperature of
their environment should decrease, as we imagined it to do from the
furnace A down to furnace D. This would bring about a condition
of molecular complexity in which the proportion of the molecular
weight of a substance so produced in a combination with another sub
stance would go on continually increasing.
   Another method of increasing molecular complexity would be repre
sented by the addition of molecules of different origins.  Representing
the first method by A+ A, we could represent the second by A+ B.
A variation of the last process would consist in a still further com
plexity being brought about by the addition of another molecule of B.
so that instead of (A +B), merely, we should have A+B.
   Of these three processes the first one seemed that which it was pos
sible to attack under the best conditions, because the consideration of
impurities was eliminated; the prior work has left no doubt upon the
mind about such and such lines being due to calcium, others to iron,
and so forth.   That is to say, they are visible in the spectra of these
substances as a rule. The inquiry took this form: Granting that these
lines are special to such and such a substance, does each become basic
in turn as the temperature is changed?
  I therefore        the search by reviewing the evidence concerning
                      began
calcium, and seeing if hydrogen, iron, and lithium behaved in the same
way.
Application      of   the above Calcium Views to Calcium,          Iron, Lithium, and

  It   was in a communication             to the Royal Society        made in        1874
(“Proc. Roy. Soc.,” vol. xxii, p. 380), that              I   first referred       to the
possibility that the well-known line spectra of the elementary bodies
might not result from the vibration of similar molecules.  was led to    I
make the remark in consequence of the differences to which I have
already drawn attention in the spectra of certain elements as observed
in the spectrum of the sun and in those obtained with the ordinary
instrumental appliances.
                                                      I
  Later (“Proc. Roy. Soc.,” No. 168, 1876) produced evidence that

and small jar, gives a spectrum with           its

   Isaid “another” or “others,” because was not then able to deter   I
mine whether the last-named lines proceeded from the same or different
molecules; and               I
                 added that it was possible we might have to wait for
photographs of the spectra of the brighter stars before this point could
be determined.
  I also   remarked that this result enabled us to fix with very consider
able   accuracy the electric dissociating conditions which are equivalent
to that degree           of dissociation at present at work in the sun.
  In    fig. 3      I have
                   collected several spectra copied from photographs, in
order that the line of argument may be grasped.
  First we see what happens to the non-dissociated and the dissociated
chloride.  Next we have the lines with a weak voltaic arc, the single                                                  *
line to the right (W. L. 4226:3) is much thicker than the two lines
(W. L. 3933 and 3968) to the left, and reverses itself.
  We have next calcium exposed to a current of higher tension.        It
will be seen that here the three lines are almost equally thick, and all
reverse themselves.
   Now       it will
                 be recollected that in the case of known compounds the
band    structure of the true compounds is reduced as dissociation works
 its   way, and          the      spectrum      of
                                 each constituent element makes its
appearance.             If

pound.
  If  the hypothesis                be

   It is abundantly clear that if the so-called elements, or more pro
perly speaking their finest atoms—those that give us line spectra—are
really compounds, the compounds must have been formed at a very
high temperature. It is easy to imagine that there may be no superior
limit to temperature, and therefore no superior limit beyond which
such combinations are possible, because the atoms which have the
power of combining together at these transcendental stages of heat do
not exist as such, or rather they exist combined with other atoms, like
or unlike, at all lower temperatures.   Hence association will be a com
bination of more    complex  molecules as temperature is reduced, and of
dissociation,   therefore,   with increased temperature there may be no
end.
  That is the first point.
  The second is this:—
                                                                              F----

perature, then in the stars hot enough to enable its constituents to
exist uncompounded,     we may expect these constituents to vary in
quantity; there may be more of x in one star and more of Y in another;
and if this be so, then the H and K lines will vary in thickness, and
the extremest   limit of variation will be that we shall only have H
representing, say, x in one star, and only have K representing, say, Y in
another.   Intermediately between these extreme conditions we may
have cases in which, though both H and K are visible, H is thicker in
Some and K is thicker in others.
  Professor Stokes was good enough to add largely to the value of my
paper as it appeared in the “Proceedings” by appending a note point
ing out that “When a solid body such as a platinum wire, traversed
by a voltaic current, is heated to incandescence, we know that as the
temperature    increases not only does the radiation of each particular
refrangibility absolutely increase, but the proportion of the radiations
of the different refrangibilities is changed, the proportion of the higher
to the lower increasing with the temperature.       It would be in accord
ance   with analogy to suppose that as a rule the same would take
 place in an incandescent surface, though in this case the spectrum
 would be discontinuous instead of continuous. Thus, if A, B, C, D, E
 denote  conspicuous bright lines of increasing refrangibility, in the
 spectrum of the vapour, it might very well be that at a comparatively
    low
     temperature Ashould      the brightest and the most persistent:
                               be                                      at

brightness might be changed, and C might be the brightest and the
most persistent, and at a still higher temperature E.”
   On these grounds Professor Stokes, while he regarded the facts                                                              I
mentioned as evidence of the high temperature of the sun, did not
look upon them as conclusive evidence of the dissociation of the mole
cule of calcium.

which      I
          referred in it has been made, and made with the most admir

   Further, in the eclipse observed in Siam in 1875, the H and K lines
left the strongest record in the spectrum of the chromosphere, while
the line near G in a photographic region of much greater intensity was
not recorded  at all. In the American eclipse of the present year the
H and K lines of calcium were distinctly visible at the base of the
corona, in which, for the first time, the observers could scarcely trace
the existence of any hydrogen.
  To sum up, then, the facts regarding calcium, we have first of all the
H line differentiated from the others by its almost solitary existence in
Sirius.  We have the K line differentiated from the rest by its birth,
so to speak, in a Aquilae, and the thickness of its line in the sun, as
compared  to that in the arc. We have the blue line differentiated
from H and K by         thinness its the solar spectrum while they are

the spectrum which we meet with in the spectra of almost all bodies,
some of which have already been pointed out by Mascart, Cornu, and
myself.   Now the facts indicate that these two triplets are not due
to the vibration of the same molecular grouping which gives rise to
most of the other lines.   They are as follows. In many photographs
in which iron has been     compared   with other bodies, and in others
again in which iron has been photographed as existing in different
degrees of impurity in other bodies, these triplets have been seen
almost alone, and the relative intensity of them, as compared with the
few remaining lines, is greatly changed.       In this these photographs
resemble one took three  I   years ago, in which a large coil and jar were
employed instead of the arc, which necessitated an exposure of an hour
instead of two minutes. In this the triplet near G is very marked; the
two adjacent lines more refrangible near        which are seen nearly it,                                        as

               find these blue bands with common salt, but they have
neither the definiteness nor the brilliancy of the lithium band. When
lithium wire burns in air it emits a somewhat crimson light; plunge
it into oxygen, and the light changes to bluish-white. This seems to
indicate that a high temperature is necessary to bring out the blue
ray.”
   Postscript, November 22, 1861.—“I have just made some further
experiments on the lithium spectrum, and they conclusively prove
that the appearance of the blue line depends entirely on the tempera
ture.   The spectrum of lithic chloride, ignited in a Bunsen's burner
flame, does not disclose the faintest trace of the blue line; replace the
Bunsen's burner by a jet of hydrogen (the temperature of which is
higher than that of the Bunsen's burner) and the blue line appears,
faint, it is true, but sharp and quite unmistakable.       If oxygen now
be  slowly  turned into the jet, the brilliancy of the blue line increases
until the temperature of the flame rises high enough to fuse the
platinum, and thus put an end to the experiment.”

The line in the violet to which I have already referred is again
differentiated from all the rest by the fact that it is the only line in
the spectrum of the sun which is strongly reversed, so far as our
present knowledge extends.   The various forms of lithium, therefore,

that the behaviour of the h line was hors ligne, and that the whole
spectrum could be reduced to one line, F.
   “1. The Fraunhofer line on the solar spectrum, named h by
Angström, which is due to the absorption of hydrogen, is not visible
in the tubes we employ with low battery and Leyden-jar power; it
may be looked upon, therefore, as an indication of relatively high
temperature.  As the line in question has been reversed by one of us
in the spectrum of the chromosphere, it follows that the chromo
sphere, when cool enough to absorb, is still of a relatively high                    tem
perature.
   “2. Under certain conditions of temperature and pressure, the
very complicated spectrum of hydrogen is reduced in our instrument
to one line in the green, corresponding to F in the solar spectrum.”

the wave-lengths corresponding to the images. We expect a priori
to find the hydrogen lines represented. We know three photographic
hydrogen   lines: F, a line near G, and h. F is just at the limit of
the photographic  part of the spectrum, and we find indeed images of
protuberances towards the less refrangible part at the limit of photo
graphic effect. For, as we shall show, a continuous spectrum in the
lower parts of the corona has been recorded, and the extent of this
continuous  spectrum gives us an idea of the part of the spectrum in
which each protuberance line is placed. We are justified in assuming,
therefore, as a preliminary hypothesis, that the least refrangible line
in the protuberance shown on the photograph is due to F, and we
shall find support of this view in the other lines. In order to deter
mine the position of the next line the dispersive power of the prism
was investigated.    The prism was placed on a goniometer table in
minimum deviation for F, and the angular distance between F and the
hydrogen line near G, i.e., HQ, was found, as a mean of several
measurements, to be    3'.  The goniometer was graduated      15", and to

 naturally looked for the third photographic        hydrogen line, which is
 generally called h, but we found no protuberance on our photographs
 corresponding to that wave-length.         Although this line is always
 weaker than HQ, its absence on the photograph is rather surprising, if
 it be not due to the fact that the  line is one which only comes out at
a   high  temperature.     This is rendered likely by the researches of
 Frankland and Lockyer (“Proc. Roy. Soc.,” vol. xvii, p. 453).
    “We    now turn to the last and strongest series of protuberances
shown on our photographs.       The distance between this series and the
one we have found reason for identifying with HQ is very little greater
than that between H8 and Hry. Assuming the distances equal, we
conclude that the squares of the inverse wave-lengths of the three
series are in arithmetical progression.      This is true as a first approxi
mation.     We then calculated the wave-length of this unknown line,
and found it to be approximately somewhat smaller than 3,957 tenth
metres. No great reliance can be placed, of course, on the number,
but it appears that the line must be close to the end of the visible
spectrum.
    “In order to decide, if possible, what this line is due to, we endea
voured to find out both by photography and fluorescence whether
hydrogen possesses a line in that part of the spectrum.         We have not
at present come to any definite conclusion.          In vacuum tubes pre
pared by Geissler containing hydrogen, a strong line more refrangible
than   H is seen,  but these same tubes show between       Hy and Hô, other
lines known not to belong to hydrogen, and the origin of the ultra
violet line is therefore difficult to make out. We have taken the spark
in hydrogen at atmospheric pressures, as impurities are easier to
eliminate, but a continuous spectrum extends over the violet and part
of the ultra-violet, and prevents any observation as to lines. We are
going on with experiments to settle this point.
    “Should it turn out that the line is not due to hydrogen, the ques
tion will arise what substance it is due to. It is a remarkable fact
that the calculated wave-length comes very close to H. Young has
found that these calcium lines are always reversed in the penumbra
and immediate neighbourhood of every important sun-spot, and calcium
must therefore go up high into the chromosphere.          We draw attention
to this coincidence, but our photographs do not allow us to draw any
certain conclusions.
    “At  any rate, it seems made out by our photographs that the
photographic light of the protuberances is in great part due to an
ultra-violet line which does not certainly belong to hydrogen.           The
protuberances as photographed by this ultra-violet ray seem to go up
higher than the hydrogen protuberances, but this may be due to the
relative greater length of the line.”
    In my remarks upon calcium      I have already  referred to the fact that

1878.]       Analysis in connexion with   the Spectrum     of   the   Sun.   177
the line which our observation led us to believe was due to calcium in
1875, was traced to that element in this year's eclipse. The observa
tions also show the curious connexion that, at the time when the
hydrogen lines were most brilliant in the corona, the calcium lines
were not detected; next, when the hydrogen lines, being still brilliant,
the h line was not present (a condition of things which, in all proba
bility, indicated a reduction of temperature), calcium began to make
itself unmistakably visible; and finally, when the hydrogen lines are
absent, H and K become striking objects in the spectrum of the corona.
    To come back to h, then, I have shown that Dr. Frankland and
myself, in 1869, found that it only made its appearance when a high
tension was employed.      We have seen that it was absent from among
the hydrogen lines during the eclipse of 1875.
  I    have now to strengthen this evidence by the remark that it is
always the shortest line of hydrogen in the chromosphere.
  I   now pass to another line of evidence.
  I   submit to the Society a photograph of the spectrum of indium, in
 which, as already recorded by Thalèn, the strongest line is one of the
 lines of hydrogen (h), the other line of hydrogen (near G) being
 absent.    I have observed the C line in the spark produced by the
 passage of an induced current between indium poles in dry air.
    As I am aware how almost impossible it is to render air perfectly
         I
 dry, made the following differential experiment.     A glass tube with
 two platinum poles about half an inch apart was employed. Through
 this tube a slow current of air was driven after passing through a
  U-tube one foot high, containing calcic chloride, and then through
 sulphuric acid in a Wolff's bottle. The spectrum of the spark passing
between      the platinum   electrodes was then observed, a coil with five
 Grove cells and a medium-sized jar being employed. Careful notes
 were made of the brilliancy and thickness of the hydrogen lines as
 compared with those of air.        This done, a piece of metallic indium,
 which was placed loose in the tube, was shaken so that one part of it
 rested against the base of one of the poles, and one of its ends at a
 distance of a little less than half an inch from the base of the other
 pole.  The spark was then passed between the indium and the pla
 tinum. The red and blue lines of hydrogen were then observed, both
 by my friend Mr. G. W. Hemming, Q.C., and myself. Their brilliancy
 was most markedly increased.      This unmistakable indication of the
 presence of hydrogen, or rather of that form of hydrogen which gives
 us the h line alone associated into that form which gives us the blue
 and red lines, showed us that in the photograph we were not dealing
 with a physical coincidence, but that in the arc this special form of
 hydrogen had really been present; that it had come from the indium,
 and that it had registered itself on the photographic plate, although
 ordinary hydrogen persistently refuses to do            so.
                                                      Although      was      I

this respect like ordinary hydrogen,    begged my friend, Mr. W. C.     I
Roberts, F.R.S., Chemist to the Mint, to charge a piece of palladium

opportunity to express my obligation to him. I exhibit to the Society
a photograph of this palladium and of indium side by side. It will be
seen that one form of hydrogen in indium has distinctly recorded
itself on the plate, while that in palladium has not left a trace.                                                          I
should add that the palladium was kept in a sealed tube till the
moment of making the experiment, and that special precautions were
taken to prevent the two pieces between which the arc was taken
from becoming unduly heated.

     Discharge.” By the Hon. Sir W. R. GROVE, D.C.L.,
     W.P.R.S. Communicated December 19, 1878.
   The difference between the appearances at the positive and negative
terminal which an electric discharge presents in vacuum tubes has
struck many observers. The negative terminal is surrounded in what
is called an air vacuum with a blue glow extending to a considerable
distance from the platinum wire, and is generally bounded by a dark
space separating         it from the crimson light of the positive wire; it is
affected by the magnet, the light following the direction of the magnetic
curves, and a deposit of platinum on the glass tube appears in time in
the vicinity of the negative which is absent at the positive terminal.
I do not propose to enter more fully on these distinctions which have
been largely experimented on by M. Gassiot, Professor Plücker, and to
                                                                                                      :

 bands between the bright lines, and on attaching a small prism (with
 which the spectroscope was provided) in front of the slit, so that the
 separate spectra of the positive and negative lights could be juxta
 posed,   I could trace several of the bands which appeared quite
 distinctly in the positive spectrum, into the negative one; but in the
latter they were very faint, while the converse case obtained with the
                    I
four bright lines have mentioned, which were brilliant in the negative
spectrum and faint or normal in the positive.
   Although the four bright lines standing out in strong relief in the
negative spectrum was the more striking phenomenon to the eye, yet
the black band in the positive appearing in the space corresponding to
the bright yellow light in the negative spectrum is equally or possibly
more important.                  -
   The positive light, far the brightest to the eye, is diffused into a
fluted spectrum of substantially equal intensity throughout, while the
negative dim light is concentrated into brilliant lines of intense lumi
nosity.
                                                I
   Another tube in which the vacuum was, have no doubt, produced
by the absorption of carbonic acid by potash, and which may be
called a carbonic acid vacuum, gave a very different result from the
three   I have mentioned.     In it the light throughout was striated and
blue, or bluish, with a slight purple tinge pervading the negative glow.
With this tube the spectra were strikingly different from those in the
air vacuo. There were in the negative spectrum of this tube six
bright lines, viz., extreme red, orange, greenish-yellow, green, greenish
blue, and violet.     The same lines with one exception were visible and
equally prominent throughout the whole of the tube. That exception,
which was noticed by Dr. Frankland, to whom          I showed my experi
ments, was the extreme red line which was apparent only in the
spectrum from the negative glow.
   On juxtaposing, by means of the prism, this spectrum with the
spectrum of the negative light in an air vacuum tube, one only of the
lines coincided, viz., the green line, the others were in entirely distinct
parts of the spectrum; this was to be expected, as the one tube would
give mainly a nitrogen spectrum, the other a carbonic oxide one.
   I                                                I
      have long been convinced, and this is now, believe, the prevalent
opinion, that the light of the electric discharge is an incandescence
of the intermedium through which it passes, and of the terminals
themselves (see “Correlation of Physical Forces,” 6th edit., pp. 75,
et seq.).
   If  this be so, then, the above experiments, i.e., those on the positive
and   negative  spectra in the same tube, must be either different spectra
of the same incandescent substances, or the attenuated gases must be
differently decomposed or united in the different parts of the tube, or
a different character of electric     polarity must ensue in the positive

and negative portions of the gas.      The first of the above conditions
can   only  result from difference of heat, which is known to produce
different spectra from the same gas.                                    I
                                          do not think the effects are due
to difference of temperature.    It is true that the negative electrode is
more heated than the positive in the electric discharge in vacuo, but
the heat disseminated by it throughout the negative glow produces in
its totality but slight rise a   temperature throughout the volume

but it would be necessary to give                       a figure, and to go          into details,       to
give the results satisfactorily.
  A similar   examination of the equation, giving the retardation of                                    the
earth's rotation, shows that there is not so much variety of result,                                    for
the tidal friction always tends to retard the earth.
   This completes the consideration of the instantaneous effects on                                     the
earth, and the next point demanding attention is the reaction, which
the bodily tides have upon the disturbing bodies.
   The problem is solved by the consideration that however the three
bodies may interact the resultant moment of momentum.of the moon
earth system remains constant, except in so far as it is affected by the
sun's action on the earth. The application of this principle results in
an equation giving the rate of increase of the square root of the moon’s
distance in terms of the heights and retardations of the several bodily
tides on the earth; it appears that     the tides, except the fortnightly
                                                         all

   Lastly, since action and reaction are equal and opposite, and since the
moon and anti-moon cause the forces TM, T'M', on the earth, therefore
the earth must cause forces                        on

  the increase of distance comes an increase of periodic time round th
  earth.
     This general explanation remains a fair representation of the stat
  of the case so long as the different harmonic constituents of the aggre
  gate tide-wave do not suffer very different amounts of retardations
  and this is the case so long as the viscosity is not great.
  Prop.  II.  The attraction of the moon on a lagging fortnightly tide cause
      the earth's obliquity to diminish, but does not affect the diurnal rota
      tion; the reaction on the moon causes a diminution of her distanc.
      and periodic time.
     The fortnightly tide of a perfectly fluid earth is a periodic increas
 and diminution of the ellipticity of figure; the increment of ellip
 ticity varies as the square of the sine of the obliquity of the equato
 to the ecliptic, and as the cosine of twice the moon's longitude from
 her node. Thus the ellipticity is greatest when the moon is in he
 nodes, and least when she is 90° removed from them.
    In a lagging fortnightly tide the ellipticity is greatest some tim
 after the moon has passed the nodes, and least an equal time after sh
 has passed the point 90° removed from them.
    The effects of this alteration of shape may be obtained by substi
 tuting for these variations of ellipticity two attractive or repulsiv
 particles, one at the North Pole and the other at the South Pole of th
 earth. These particles must be supposed to wax and wane, so tha
 when the real ellipticity of figure is greatest they have their maximur
 repulsive power, and when least they have their maximum attractiv
 power; and their positive and negative maxima are equal.
    We will now take the extreme case when the obliquity is 90°; thi
 makes the fortnightly tide as large as possible.
    Let the plane of the paper be that of the ecliptic, and let the oute
semicircle be the moon's orbit, which she describes in the direction o

 1878.]           the Precession     of a Viscous Spheroid, &c.              189
 the arrows.     Let NS be the earth's axis, which lies by hypothesis in
 the ecliptic, and let LL be the nodes of the orbit.               Let N be the
 North   Pole;  that is to   say, if the earth were turned about the line LL',
 so that N rises above the plane of the paper, the earth's rotation would
be in the same direction as the moon’s orbitual motion.
    First consider the     case where the earth   is perfectly fluid, so that the
tides do not lag.
    Let m2, m, be points in the orbit whose longitudes are 45° and 135°;
and   suppose  that couples acting on the earth about an axis at Operpen
dicular to the plane of the paper are called positive when they are in
the direction    of the curved arrow at O. Then, when the moon is at
m1 the   particles   at N and S have their maximum repulsion.             But at
this instant the moon is equidistant from both, and there is no
couple about O.          As, however, the moon passes to m2 there is a            #
positive   couple, which vanishes when the moon is at m2, because the
particles have waned to zero. From m2 to m2 the couple is negative;
from m3 to m, positive; and from m, to ms negative.            Now, the couple    |
goes through just the same changes of magnitude, as the moon passes
from mi to    m2, as  it does while the moon passes from m, to ms, but         in
the reverse    order; the like may be said of the arcs m3m3 and m3m.
Hence it follows that the average effect, as the moon passes through              :
half its course, is nil, and therefore there can be no secular change in
the position of the earth's axis.
   But now consider the case when the tide lags. When the moon is
at mi the couple is zero, because she is equally distant from both
particles.    The particles have not, however, reached their maximum
of  repulsiveness;     this they do when the moon has reached M1, and
they do not cease to be repulsive until the moon has reached M2.
Hence, during the description of the arc miM, the couple round O- is
positive.
   Throughout the arc Mims the couple is negative, but it vanishes
when the moon is at m3, because the moon and the two particles are in
a straight line.     The particles reach their maximum of attractiveness
when the moon is at M3, and the couple continues to be positive until
the moon is at    M.
   Lastly, during the description of the arc Mims the couple is negative.
   But now there is      no longer a balance between the arcs mil/2 and
Mims, nor between Mims and maN. The arcs during which the couples
are positive are longer and the couples are more intense than in the
rest of the semi-orbit.        Hence the average effect of the couples is a
positive couple, that is to say, in the direction         of the curved arrow
round O.
   It  may be remarked that if the arcs miM1, m2M, m.AMs, m.M. had
been  45°,  there would have been no negative couples at all, and the
positive couples would merely have varied in intensity.

   Now, a couple round O in the direction of the arrow, when com
bined with the earth's rotation, would, according to the principle of
the gyroscope, cause the pole N to rise above the plane of the paper,
that is to say, the obliquity of the ecliptic would diminish. The same
thing would happen, but to a less extent, if the obliquity had been less
than 90°; it would not, however, be nearly so easy to show this from
general considerations.
   Since the forces which act on the earth always pass through N and S,
therefore there can be no moment about the axis NS, and the rotation
about that axis remains unaffected. This can hardly be said to amount
to strict proof that the diurnal rotation is unaffected by the fortnightly
tide, because it has not been rigorously shown that the two particles at
N and S are a complete equivalent to the varying ellipticity of figure.
   Lastly, the reaction on the moon must obviously be in the opposite
direction to that of the curved arrow at O; therefore there is a force
retarding her linear motion, the effect of which is a diminution of her
distance and of her periodic time.
   The fortnightly tidal effect must be far more efficient for very great
viscosities than for small ones, for, unless the viscosity is very great,
the substance of the spheroid has time to behave sensibly like a perfect
fluid, and the tide hardly lags at all.

192                                 Mr. G. H. Darwin        on                          [Dec. 19,
apparent acceleration of 4" per century, and                I
                                              found that, if the earth
were purely viscous, the moon must be undergoing a secular retarda
tion of 36" per century, while the earth (considered as a clock) must
be losing fourteen seconds in the same time. The obliquity also must
be diminishing at the rate of 1° in 470 million years.
  Under these circumstances the earth must have so great an effective
rigidity that the bodily semi-diurnal and diurnal tides would be quite
insensible; the bodily fortnightly tide would however be so consider
able that the oceanic fortnightly tide would be reduced to one-seventh
of its theoretical value on a rigid nucleus, and the time of high water
would be accelerated by three days.
   The supposition that the earth is a nearly perfectly elastic spheroid
leads to very different results in this respect, which, however,    will                       I
now pass over.
  From this and other considerations,                I conclude
                                                  that a secular accele
ration of the moon's motion affords no datum for determining the
present amount of tidal friction.
   Sir W. Thomson has discussed the probable age of the earth from
considering the tidal friction, and he derived his estimate of the rate
at which the earth's diurnal rotation is slackening, principally from
the secular acceleration of the moon. He fully admitted that his data
did not admit of precise results, but, if                   I
                                             am correct, it certainly
appears that his argument loses some of its force.
   The differential equations, which have to be solved in order to
investigate the secular changes in the configuration of the three bodies,
are exceedingly complex, and               I
                                was only able to solve them by a labo
rious method, depending partly on analysis and partly on numerical
                                                                          -
quadratures.
  The solution was only applicable to the case where the earth is a
purely viscous body, and the numerical value chosen for the coefficient
of viscosity was such that the changes proceed with about the maxi
mum rapidity. Starting with the present values of the obliquity, day,
month, and year, the changes were traced backwards in time.      As we
go backwards we find the year sensibly constant, but the obliquity,
day and month       all
                   diminishing—the last with far the greatest rapidity.

of the coefficient of viscosity which is used in this solution is as
follows:—If a slab of the materials of the earth an inch thick have
one face held fixed, and if the other face be subjected to a tangential
stress of 13' tons to the square inch for 24 hours, then the two faces
have been displaced relatively to one another through one-tenth of an
inch. Such a material would in ordinary parlance be called a solid,
and in the tidal problem this must be regarded as a moderately small
viscosity, whence           I conclude        that the earth may have been habitable,
and yet have undergone               these changes.
  Amongst the conclusions of interest to geologists is the following:
namely, that the amount of heat generated in the interior of the earth
by internal friction, during these 56 million years, would be sufficient, if
applied all at once, to heat the whole earth's mass 1,755° F., supposing
the earth to have the specific heat of iron.                         If
                                                     then it is permissible
to suppose   that any considerable part of these changes has taken
place  during  geological history, the estimate of the age of the earth,
which is founded on the assumption that the earth is simply a cooling
sphere, would have to undergo modification.
   A second solution of the differential equations is next given, adapted
to the hypothesis that the earth stiffened as it cooled; but no definite
law of stiffening is assumed.       This solution follows a line closely
similar to that of the last up  to the point where the day has fallen to
6 hrs. 50 mins.   The obliquity      however, foundis,   decrease slightlyto
more      than    in   the previous solution.

new method          of

1878.]                  with    the Tides         of a Viscous Spheroid.                              195
  In forming the theory of tides, it was assumed that the action.
of the tidal protuberance on any element of the surface of the mean
sphere was entirely normal to the sphere, and consisted of the weight
of the prismatic element of the tidal protuberance, which stands on
the element of surface.  This is not rigorously correct, because, if it
were so,           would be no couples tending to alter the diurnal
                there
rotation and   obliquity of the earth. The effects of these couples were
considered in the    paper  on “Precession,” but the tidal protuberance
was there assumed to be instantaneously     rigidly connected with the
mean   sphere.   The   present problem is concerned with the non-rigid                     -
attachment of the protuberance to the sphere.
   A sphere is supposed to be distorted into any form differing                                           in
finitesimally from the true sphere, and to be acted on by any external
disturbing potential. It is then found what tangential stress must be
supposed to act across the base of any prismatic element of the pro
tuberance, in order that the equilibrium of that element may be main
tained, the pressures transmitted by the four contiguous elements
being taken   into account. It appears that if the protuberance has
the equilibrium form, due to the external disturbing potential, then
there is no tangential stress between the true sphere and the pro
tuberance.    But since the tides of a viscous spheroid lag, the form of
the viscous tidal protuberance is not one of equilibrium, and there is
such a tangential stress across the base of each element of the pro
tuberance.    It is obvious that these tangential stresses may produce a
continued distortion of the spheroid.
   The problem, as applicable to the earth, is treated in the simple case
where the obliquity to the ecliptic is zero, and where there is only one
disturbing body or moon.
   The sum of the moments of the tangential stresses about the axis of
rotation gives the tidal frictional couple, and          form    found      its            is              to
 agree with that found by      different method

effective forces give bodily forces in the interior, the sum of whose
moments about the axis of rotation is equal and opposite to the tidal
frictional couple. The problem is thus reduced to finding the                                              dis
tortion of                    to bodily force equilibrated by surface
                a sphere subject
action, and it is solved by Sir W. Thomson's method of finding the
internal strain of an elastic sphere under like conditions, although
here the bodily force has no corresponding potential function.
   The solution shows that the distortion consists in a simple cylin
drical motion round the axis of rotation, each point moving from east
to west with a linear velocity proportional to the cube of its distance
from that axis.
   The distortion of the surface of the globe consists of a motion in
longitude from west to east, relatively to a point in the equator, the
rate of change of longitude being proportional to the square of the
sine of the latitude.
   Numerical calculation shows, however, that in the later stages of
the earth's history (the development being supposed to follow the
laws found in the paper on “Precession”), the distortion must have
been very small.  With a certain assumed viscosity, it is found that,
looking back 45,000,000 years, a point in latitude 60° would lie 14'
further            at present. From this it follows, that this cause
           east than
can have had little or nothing to do with the crumpling of geological
Strata.
  As, however, the distorting force varies inversely as the sixth power
of the moon's distance, it seems possible that in the very earliest
stages this cause may have had sensible effects.                              It   is,   therefore,    note
worthy that the wrinkles raised                      on

 198     Mr. G. H. Darwin        on  Tides of a Viscous Spheroid.      [Dec. 19,
     The first approximation, being that given in the paper on “Tides,” is
 here used to give a value to the terms introduced in the equations of
 motion by inertia. Physically the terms so introduced are equivalent
 to an addition to the bodily force which tends to produce the tidal
 distortion.    The problem is then treated by a process parallel to that
 used   by Sir W. Thomson in his statical problem concerning the strain
 of an elastic sphere.       The analytical investigation is long and com
 plicated, and it will here suffice to state the result with regard to the
 form of the tidal protuberance, when the tide-generating potential
is of the second order of harmonics.             It is as follows:—If a be the
 radius,   w the density,     9 mean gravity,
                           y, g       9.      y and g =%, V the “speed”p      of
                                                          O(l
the tide, n the alteration of phase; so that          n + v is the “lag,” and   v
the coefficient of viscosity.

    And the height of tide is equal to the equilibrium tide of a perfectly

                                         (l +
    This shows that the defect of the first approximation was such that
for a given speed, the lag is a little greater, and for a given lag, the
height of tide is a little greater than was supposed.
    It is then shown that this correction to the theory of tides will
scarcely make any appreciable difference in the results of the integra
tion, by which the secular changes in the configuration of the earth
and moon, were found in the paper on “Precession;” and especially
that it makes no difference as to the        critical relationship between the
month and day, for which the rate            of change of obliquity vanishes.
The most important influence of the          new theory is on the time, and it
appears that the time occupied by            the changes, above referred to,  is
overstated by perhaps Toth part.
    A  comparison is then made of the preceding theory with that of the
forced vibrations of a fluid sphere. This shows that when n is zero
(i.e., when viscosity graduates into fluidity), the I'', which occurs in
the above expressions should properly be # or            #.     The discrepancy
between the 79 and 75 is explained by the fact that in approaching
the problem of fluidity from the side of viseosity, we suppose in the
first approximation, that the motion of the interior of the sphere is
vortical, whereas in reality it is not so.
    In conclusion, it is proved that analysis, of almost identically the
same character as that for the problem of the viscous sphere, is appli
cable to the case of an incompressible elastic sphere, and that inertia
has the effect of increasing the ellipticity of the tidal spheroid, as given

them in darkness—the           two tubes of Pasteur solution                each contained
several tiny specks of mycelium.
   One of the two was on this again exposed to sunlight, and in it the
mycelial development was at once stopped; the other tube was left in
the dark and the fungus gradually grew till it filled the whole space
of the liquid, which on microscopical examination was found to con
tain no other organisms.   The tube of urine remained clear till July
15th, 1878,-nearly ten months after incasement, -on which date
two specks of mycelium appeared, and subsequently developed as in
the previous case. No Bacteria could be seen on examination with an
immersion "g". It is noteworthy that a companion tube to this which
was incased after six days of insolation had developed a growth of
mycelium in three or four days.
   It would seem that in the three tubes above mentioned Bacteria,
or their “germs,” had been either wholly destroyed or reduced to so
low a state of vitality that they were unable to develope in the fluids
in question; while it is evident that the spores of the mould which at
length appeared, unless they had been accidentally shaken down from
the cotton-wool plugging the tubes, had undergone some change which
reduced them to a condition of torpidity from which in process of
time they emerged.          a condition, we may perhaps conceive,
                               Such
might be brought about by any influence causing thickening of the
cell-wall of the spore. We hope at a future time to offer some further
evidence on this question of revival of dormant germs, which       we                 is,
think,  ofmuch interest.

 monochromatic.     The red was                        an
                                       excellent glass for the purpose.

 The rays which were found to           pass through     each   glass respectively
 are given below.
    Blue—Violet, blue, some green, broad band in yellow-green, very
 narrow band in ultra-red.
     Yellow.—The whole spectrum,           except violet     and about    half the
 blue.
    Red—Red, orange-red.          All  other rays entirely absorbed.
    The mean of a number of observations as to temperature showed
 that, at the point at which we worked, viz., 70°–80°F, the ther
mometer in the red box stood about 2°F. higher than in the lead
incased tubes; between the blue, yellow, and ordinary glass boxes
there was but little difference, the blue being about half a degree
 warmer than the last named.
    We showed in our former communication                 that by increasing the
density of our cultivation-liquid        the development of Bacteria could be
 proportionately delayed.       In this way we have been able to accentuate
 the differences in the behaviour of the solutions under varying con
ditions of light.     Without detailing all the experiments, we may say
that the first tubes to become turbid were the lead-incased; the next,
usually in from 24–48 hours subsequently, the red, followed shortly
 by the yellow;” white and blue surviving.
    The organisms which first appeared in the lead-incased and red
 were always Bacteria; in the yellow, usually Torula, or mycelium, with
 more   or less Bacteria,—rarely Bacteria alone; if organisms appeared
in the blue or ordinary glass they were torulaceous.
    Although the blue and yellow glasses were not monochromatic, we
think that these results give important indications.              That the action
is chiefly dependent on the blue and violet rays is shown by the great
difference, as compared with those in the blue box, in the behaviour of
the tubes in the yellow, in which, as we have already stated, the only
rays of the spectrum not admitted were the violet and part of the
blue.
    Moreover, the fact that when the cultivation-fluid is of sufficient
concentration the red (although the warmer) survives the lead-incased
shows, we think, that the red and orange-red rays are not altogether
inactive.
    It is probable therefore that, if the phenomena were represented by
a curve, the maximum elevation would be found in or near the violet,
a rapid descent occurring in the blue or green, after which the line of
the curve is maintained more or less as far as the visible red.
    The experiments next to be detailed bear upon the part played by
the   cultivation-fluid in the phenomena under consideration.              We had

shown, in our previous paper, that the liquid in tubes which under
insolation had remained barren was, nevertheless, not impaired as a
nidus for development, for, on removing them to a dark place and
inoculating with a drop of ordinary water, they soon teemed with
vigorous bacterial life; the same experiment showing that the survival
of the spores of mycelial fungi, as compared with Bacteria, was not
due to any change in the cultivation-fluid rendering it noxious to the
latter, but not to the former. At the same time, though this was not
probable, there might have been a temporary and transient action
dependent on some constituent of the cultivation-fluid.         We de
termined, therefore, to render the conditions as simple as possible.
   It is well known that        all
                             ordinary water, even distilled, teems with
the “germs”—actual          potential—of various forms

  We made      number
                a           of        glass bulbs,  the shape shown

Pasteur solution, previously boiled; one end of each was then sealed.
They were then placed in a water-bath, with the unsealed end project
ing above the water, and after prolonged and repeated boiling this
end also was sealed.    The sealed bulbs were then thoroughly washed
with distilled water, to remove all traces of Pasteur solution from their
external surfaces, and were each finally sealed up in a tube (fig. 2)
containing distilled water in such proportion that, when the bulbs
were subsequently broken, the mixture produced a fluid of the ordi
nary   strength.     Four were incased in laminated              lead and five   in
solated.
  To prove that the water employed was capable of setting up
bacterial or other development, a number of tubes containing Pasteur
solution sterilised by repeated boiling and plugged with cotton wool
were divided into two series; to each tube of the one set a few drops
of the water were added with a superheated pipette; to the second
series no water was added, but, in order to place them under the same
conditions, the superheated pipette was successively dipped into each.
All of the series inoculated with water speedily teemed with Bacteria;
the second series remained clear.
    The experiment commenced on April 3rd. About the end of May,
the bulb in one of the insolated tubes was accidentally broken, so that
the concentrated Pasteur solution of the bulb mingled with the dis
tilled water of the tube. In a few days the mixture became turbid
with Bacteria and Torula.    We shall again refer to the behaviour of
this tube.
   The remaining bulbs were broken towards the close of July by
jerking them against the ends of the tubes.  The result was that, with
one exception, the mixture in the tubes which had been insolated has
remained clear to the date of writing (September 1st), but in each
instance the incased tubes became turbid with organisms.
  In the single insolated tube which broke down nothing could be
seen on careful examination with T'," but round-celled Torula ; there
was a complete absence of all bacterioid life.  The incased tubes all
contained Torula, Bacilli, Bacteria, in active movement, and, in two
instances, a number of short, squarish, highly refractive particles.
  It is evident, therefore, that light is injurious to “germs,” even
when contained in ordinary distilled water.     There                is,
                                                             however, an

of this  time, we had insolated     tubes,  containing ordinary Pasteur
solution, with the result that all bacterial development was prevented
by
a      few days’ exposure         to   the sun, and organisms,   if   they appeared
after the tubes had been incased, were torulaceous             or   mycelial. There

appears, therefore, to be a remarkable difference in the rate of action
of light on the germs of Bacteria in water, as compared with its effect
on corresponding “germs” in the cultivation-fluid; insolation of, say
a week, accomplishing, in the latter case, what nearly two months
failed to do in the former.
   The most reasonable explanation to our minds is the following:—In
water destitute of organic matter the “germs” are deprived of the
nourishment essential for their growth and development—they                     are
starved; under these conditions their protoplasm reverts to a state of
rest and stability, contrasting with that condition of instability which
the exhibition of vital energy implies. Possibly they become encysted,
the outer portion of the protoplasm being devitalised and protecting
the central speck, which may be said to exist rather than to live
When, however, the “germ” finds suitable nourishment, the proto
plasm takes on a higher state of activity and, therefore, of instability,
and we believe that this instability of protoplasm favours the action
upon it of light, but that in a condition of dormant vitality it is less
                                                      -
susceptible.
   Numerous other observations of similar character, which we need
not here detail, gave the same results, and the following simple ex
periment, repeatedly confirmed, indicates the germicidal action of
light when no water, other than the ordinary moisture in air, is
present:
    April 15th. Four test-tubes are rinsed out with tap-water, inverted
to allow the moisture to drain off, and plugged with cotton-wool. Two
are covered with laminated lead, and two insolated in the usual way.
(Corresponding tubes, charged with Pasteur solution previously
sterilised by boiling, speedily became turbid with Bacteria.)
    May   1st. The four tubes are charged with sterilised Pasteur              solu
tion.
    In  about a fortnight the lead-incased         tubes both became turbid,”
but the    liquid  in the insolated tubes was still clear on July 16th.
    We now proceed to give an account of experiments which bear
more directly on the intimate nature of the action under consideration.
    From an early stage in the investigation we felt that the best way
of approaching the problem was by examining the behaviour of organic
bodies generally when exposed to sunlight.              Taking, in the first in
stance, the comparatively simple molecule of oxalic acid as the subject
of our experiment, we found that a decinormal solution (.63 per cent.)
was entirely decomposed by sunlight. It was obviously important
to ascertain what was the nature of the decomposition, i.e., whether it
were a disintegration of the molecule into water, carbonic acid, and
   * Subsequent microscopical examination showed that this was due in the one case
to a species of Sarcina, in the other to Bacteria, which did not, however, take on a
very vigorous  development.

carbonic     oxide, or an oxidation resulting     in water and carbonic acid
alone.
    We found that whether oxygen was removed by exhaustion at the
Sprengel     pump, or by boiling the solution and inverting in mercury
without access of air, decomposition was alike prevented. It was evi
dent, therefore, that oxygen was the agent of destruction under the
influence of sunlight, for of course the nitrogen of the air may be put
out of the question.
    We next experimented        on a representative of a most interesting
class of   bodies,  which in the complexity of their composition probably
approach protoplasm itself. We refer to the so-called soluble or indi
rect ferments, of which we selected zymase, the soluble ferment of
yeast, as a type.
   We noticed last year that sunlight had no retarding effect on the          |
action of this class of ferments, but we did not then investigate the
effect of prolonged insolation on the ferment itself.        Accordingly, on
June   25th,  some water in which a   fragment   of yeast had been macerated
was thrice passed through double layers of the finest filtering paper.
Examined under the microscope, the liquid, which was quite clear, was
found to contain no trace of Torula.          Salt was then added to satura
 tion, in order     to avoid putrefaction, and the solution was divided
 between two series of test-tubes, one series being insolated, and the
 other incased in the usual way.
    On July 19th about three drachms of freshly made syrup was placed
 in each of a number of éprouvettes.       These were divided into two sets;
 to one set was added five grain-measures of the insolated zymase solu
 tion, and to the other a corresponding quantity from the incased tubes;
 a watch-glass was placed over each, and they were left for some hours.
 At the end of this time, five grain-measures of the syrup to which
 zymase from the incased tubes had been added completely reduced an
 equal quantity of a Fehling's solution, while no perceptible change
 was caused by the syrup which had been treated with insolated zymase.
    It is clear, therefore, that sunlight destroys the specific power of this
 ferment for hydrating cane-sugar.
    We next experimented on zymase in vacuo. On August 16th a solu
 tion of the ferment, prepared in the same way as before, was divided
 between eight tubes, two of which were insolated and two incased.
 The remaining four were simultaneously” exhausted at the Sprengel
 pump and sealed.        The contents gave a sharp “water-hammer” click,
 bearing testimony to the excellence         of the vacuum.    Two of  these
 tubes were insolated and two incased.
    On September      5th, eight éprouvettes of fresh syrup were inoculated
 with  liquid from    each tube as before, and allowed to stand overnight, a
                                 * See Appendix.

measured             by

            Experiments in which nitrogen was admitted into the exhausted
tubes          before they were sealed gave similar results.
  The obvious inference that the presence of oxygen is essential to this
action of light is confirmed by the following experiment—many times
repeated—showing that the effect is in direct relation to the proportion
of free oxygen:—
  A Pasteur solution of half the strength given in our former paper,
and therefore, for reasons stated in that paper, difficult to sterilise by
insolation,         was divided between six tubes.
            Two of these were simply sealed, and therefore contained an atmo
sphere               of ordinary air.
  Two were exhausted at the Sprengel pump till the gauge stood at a
height of 22 inches, when, by means of the apparatus described in the
Appendix, nitrogen was admitted, and the tubes being sealed, conse
quently only contained about one-twentieth of oxygen in their atmo
spheres.  The remaining two tubes were exhausted thoroughly and
                                                                                                                                      -|

            One tube of each series was incased in laminated lead, the com                                                             -•

     two days more the insolated tube, with £5th oxygen atmosphere,
            In

  Next day after this, the insolated tube, with      atmosphere                                    an                            of
ordinary air, became hazy with Bacteria.
  The tube, with an atmosphere     pure oxygen, remained unchanged

  Vacuum Apparatus.—In conducting our experiments in vacuo, or in
a modified atmosphere, obtained by means of the Sprengel pump, it
was necessary to ensure that the tubes compared should be under
exactly similar conditions with regard to pressure; and it seemed
desirable, therefore, to exhaust the pairs, or double pairs, at one opera
tion. With this object an adapter was contrived, which, though simple
in   its
      construction, proved          so
                                efficient that   may       worth while
                                                                it          be              to

with the entrance      tube of the pump, while the other had bored in it
four holes into which the ends of the experimental tubes were pushed
until the “shoulder” (see fig. 3) was firmly thrust against the india
rubber. All junctions were luted with viscid glycerine, and it was
found that a good vacuum could then be produced and maintained for
a considerable time.
    In order conveniently    to seal off the tubes they were again drawn
out below the shoulder, so that when complete they had the shape
given in the figure (fig. 3).
    When atmospheres of special composition were required the mode
of procedure was somewhat different; one of the four holes in the
outer caoutchouc stopper was then appropriated to a gauge, formed of
a straight piece of tubing of sufficient length, dipping under mercury:
into  another hole was fitted a glass tube to which was attached a piece
of india-rubber tubing with a clamp. The pump was then worked
until the gauge showed the required tension, when the gas was admitted
from a   small gasholder by attaching the stop-cock of the gasholder to
the india-rubber tubing and opening the clamp.
   The nitrogen used was prepared by removing the oxygen from atmo
spheric    air, either by the prolonged action of alkaline solution of
pyrogallic acid, or, in some instances, by the combustion of phos
phorus;    in the latter case the oxides of phosphorus were removed by
agitating    with solution of caustic potash.
   Our oxygen was made by heating pure chlorate of potash alone in a
tube of hard glass; lest any trace of ozone or chlorine should be
present the gas was slowly bubbled through solution of iodide of
potash;     this precaution, however, appeared to     be superfluous,   the
iodide  solution remaining colourless.
                Postscript.     Received October 18, 1878.
    The oxidation of hydrogen by light, demonstrated in the case of
oxalic acid, naturally suggests an inquiry into the deportment of
oxygen    towards hydrogen in sunlight under other conditions.
    We have not, for the present at least, an opportunity of examining
this question in the detail which it demands, but we think that it may
be of interest to append to our paper the following brief observations.
    One of the best known facts in the chemistry of light is the combi
nation effected between chlorine and hydrogen, and in their behaviour
 towards hydrogen under the influence of light the halogens form an

 in sunlight, bromine and hydrogen are with difficulty, if at all, induced
 to combine, and iodine and hydrogen do not unite at all. Again, water
 may be decomposed with the aid of sunlight both by chlorine" and by

bromine," but not by iodine.    Finally, while hydrochloric and hydro
bromic acid in aqueous solution each resist decomposition when insolated
in the presence of free oxygen, it is known that hydriodic acid under
like conditions is rapidly destroyed.t This destruction, according to
our experiments, is promoted by all the rays, but is much less active
behind red glass than behind blue. It occurs also, but more slowly,
in the dark.
   Here we appear to have a phenomenon analogous to the oxidation of
the hydrogen of oxalic acid.
   The question arises how far a preliminary dissociation of the con
stituent atoms of the molecule may influence the reaction. It has been
clearly shown by M. Lemoinet that hydriodic acid gas is completely
dissociated by light; but the same observer states that in aqueous
solution no such dissociation in sunlight can be demonstrated—a fact
observed also by M. Berthelot.      It may be, however, that the phe
nomena of dissociation and oxidation under hght may go on side by
side, the presence of oxygen promoting the splitting of hydriodic
acid by its determining affinity.  In like manner it may be that in the
decomposition of oxalic acid the oxygen plays a similar part, deter
mining the dissociation of C.O.H.2, and replacing the dissociated
radicle C.O. The analogy of chlorine, however, leads us to the belief
that, in      its
            relations  hydrogen under the influence

in the laboratory of the Royal Institution.      They were carefully
packed in sawdust, but when unpacked the fragile sealed ends of
about 20 of them were found broken off. Some of these injured
flasks were empty, while others still retained their liquids. The 80
unbroken flasks were found pellucid, and they continued so throughout
the summer.     All the broken ones, on the other hand, which had
retained their liquids, were turbid with organisms.

flasks in the air above the sawdust.   Exposed to a temperature of 70°
or 80° F., the contents of all these flasks became turbid in two or
three days.

successive days.    Placed in a room with a temperature of from 70°
to 80° F., they all, without exception, became turbid with organisms.
  Another batch of flasks, after having their sealed ends broken off,
was infectedby the water of a cascade derived from the melting of
the mountain snows. They were afterwards exposed to a day's strong
sunshine, and subsequently removed to the warm room.     In three
days they were thickly charged with organisms.
  On the same day a number of flasks had their ends snipped off in
  theopen air beside the cascade.     They remained for weeks trans

      Lacertilia. Part I. On the Skull of the Common Lizards
      (Lacerta agilis, L. viridis, and Zootoca vivipara).”           By W.
      K.  PARKER,    F.R.S. Received October         18, 1878.
                                  (Abstract.)
   The youngest, and therefore the most important, embryos that have
been worked out in this present piece of research, were sent me, with
those of the snake, by Dr. Max Braun, of Würzburg.
   Other valuable specimens were the gifts of Professor T. Rupert
Jones, F.R.S., and Professor Alfred H. Garrod, F.R.S.
   The  three species worked     out are closely related, and two   of them
are native to this country: these familiar Sand Lizards are amongst
the smallest, and yet the -most highly specialized, types, to be found
among the Reptilia.
   This type may be taken as a sort of “norma,” and by it all the
other Lacertilia may be measured, as it were, when their height in the
Reptilian scale is to be determined.
   When such forms as Hatteria and the chamaeleon are compared
with a typical Lacertian, then we see how much there is that is gene
ralized in those outlying species.
   Putting together what      I have learned as yet of the structure of the
skull in the true   Reptiles,   and comparing what is seen in these cold
blooded Sauropsida with what is seen in the hot-blooded bird,         I  have
come to the conclusion that the common lizard is a       culminating  type.
   The snake, the tortoise, and the crocodile, notwithstanding their
own peculiar specializations, are yet more general in their nature
than the nobler and higher kinds of lizards: this is especially shown
by the number of characters that are, in the latter, in conformity with
those of the bird.
   And, indeed, with the high or Carinate bird; for the skull of the
 Ratitae (ostrich and cassowary) does not undergo, in several things,
 so much metamorphosis as the skull of the typical lizard; for, as           I
 showed long ago, these birds are not devoid of a Batrachian strain.
    Of all the lizards known to me the chamaeleon is the lowest; in
 some respects the Chelonians come nearer the higher Lacertilia than
 that bizarre type does. I have carefully worked out the skull in the
 adult and the ripe embryo of the common kind, and in the adult of the
 dwarf  species.
    In several things the lizard's skull is but little modified from that
 of the snake; this is especially seen in the nasal structure, its glands,
 and the bones of its floor; so largely illustrated in my last paper.
    These things are not repeated in the Chelonia and crocodiles, nor do
 they   exist in the chamaeleon;       but in many birds,     especially   the

“songsters,” these curious specializations                reappear, but the parts are
lessened and modified.
   Even many of those metamorphoses of the skull, which when                                   I
worked out that of the chick seemed to me to be peculiarly avian, and
indeed not to be found amongst the almost reptilian Ratitae, now
turn out to be lacertian also.
   For instance, the separate cartilages that pad the “basi-pterygoid
processes”   of the skull and the pterygoid bones, at their articulation,
these appear  in the lizard; and even the division of the septum nasi
from the  ethmoidal wall begins in Lacerta, and other lizards.
   That separation  of the two regions has its explanation in the higher
birds, whose fore face hinges on the skull; notably in the parrot.
   In Lacerta it is a mere “fenestra,” of no use to the creature; so it
is in the semi-struthious Tinamou, and in some low, Southern passe
rine birds, e.g., Grallaria squamigera.
   But in the huge Ratitae it is as absent, as in the Chelonia, and
the low chamaeleon.
  This latter kind has no column-shaped bone on the pterygoid (“epi
pterygoid”); that bone exists but is small and modified in the Che
lonia; in birds, especially the “songsters,” it is manifestly a process of
the pterygoid, but I have never seen it as a distinct bone.
  These are some of the more striking characters in the skull of the
adult  lizard and its sauropsidan relatives, namely, snakes, tortoises,
crocodiles, and birds: the latter, it may be remarked, differ less in
their structure from a lizard than many an imago-insect does from its
pupa.
     I have
          a strong suspicion that the serpent is degraded as well as
more ancient and generalized, as compared to the lizard: it has mani
festly lost its limbs, and the correlate of that loss is an arrest of
the cartilaginous cranium.    The small rudiments of orbitosphenoids
and alisphenoids,   seen in the snake, are no longer an anomaly and
unexplainable:   they are patches of the large tracts in the lizard, which
has, contrary to what       I
                         long believed, a large alisphenoid on each side.
                                                                                      in is,

                                                                       the

     Inits auditory structures the high Lacertian      corresponds very

only    non-essentials from the bird.

 VII. “On       the Chemical Composition of Aleurone Grains.”                By
       SYDNEY H. WINES,         B.A.,   B.Sc., F.L.S.,   Fellow and Lecturer
       of Christ's      College,    Cambridge.        Communicated       by Dr.
       MICHAEL FosTER, Praelector of Physiology in Trinity Col
       lege, Cambridge.         Received October 22, 1878.
      I.   The Aleurone Grains of the Blue Lupin.         (Lupinus varius.)
    The proteids stored up in the       seeds of certain plants, more especially
of   Leguminosae,     have been stated by various observers to exist in the
form of the vegetable caseins such as Legumin and Conglutin, and
this view has been advocated of late years more particularly by
Ritthausen (“Die Eiweiss-Körper der Getreidearten, &c., 1872”). In
1877, Weyl published          some observations       (“Zeitschr, für Physiol.
Chemie, Bd.       I),  which tend    to show that the proteids      exist in the
seeds of these plants in the         form of globulins, and that the caseins,
extracted by Ritthausen and          others, are the products of the alteration
of the globulins effected by         the reagents (alkaline solutions) used in
their extraction.
    In order to    be in a position to form a decided opinion upon the sub
ject,  I  first repeated Weyl's experiments, using the seeds of the blue
lupin.      I found that on treating the ground seeds with 10 per cent.
NaCl     solution,  I obtained   a fluid which gave all the reactions charac
teristic of fluids which hold globulins in solution.           On dilution with
water it      gave  a  precipitate   of a substance soluble in 10 per cent.
NaCl solution (vitellin); and on saturating it with NaCl (rock-salt),
a substance (myosin) was precipitated             which was soluble in 10 per
cent. NaCl solution.
     With the view of ascertaining the value of Weyl's suggestion, that
the casein (conglutin, Ritthausen) contained in the lupin was a pro
duct of the alteration of the globulin under the action of an alkaline
solution,     I  made the following experiment:          –   About 50 grims. of
 the ground lupin-seeds were placed on           a filter, and 250 cub. centims.
0.1 per cent. NaHO solution poured over them. The fluid ran through
 in a few minutes, and was found to give the reactions characteristic of
 alkaline solutions of vegetable casein (see “Sachsse, Chemie und
 Physiologie der Farbstoffe,” &c., 1877, p. 267). The residue on the
 filter was then well washed with distilled water until the washings
 ceased to give an alkaline reaction. It was then treated with 250 cub.
 centims. 10 per cent. NaCl solution, and on testing the filtrate it was

1878.]         Chemical Composition     of Aleurone Grains.             219
found to hold much globulin in solution. The residue on the filter
was then placed in a beaker with 500 cub. centims. of the 0.1 per cent.
NaHO solution, and allowed to stand for twenty-four hours. At the
end of that time the alkaline fluid was poured off, and the residue
placed on a filter and well washed with distilled water.   On treating
it with 10 per cent. NaCl solution it was impossible to extract from it
more than the merest traces of globulin. It appears, therefore, that
the globulin had become altered by the action of the alkaline fluid,
that it had in fact become dissolved in it in the form of alkali-albumin.
This change probably        occurs in   the extraction   of conglutin    by
Ritthausen's method.
  Moreover,    I found that conglutin prepared according to Ritt
hausen's methods gives reactions which are characteristic of the
substances formed when various animal proteids are treated with
dilute acid or alkaline solutions (acid-albumin, alkali-albumin), and it
does not differ very widely from these substances in elementary com
position.   These facts support the view that conglutin is merely a pro
duct of the alteration of the true reserve-proteids.  Weyl had already
shown that no      proteids, except  such as are soluble in 10 per cent.
NaCl solution, can be extracted from the seeds by treating them with
1 per cent. Na2CO, solution.     This proves that conglutin does not pre
exist in the seed.
  I  therefore agree with Weyl in concluding that the proteids stored
up in the seeds of the blue lupin consist of globulins (vegetable
vitellin and vegetable myosin).
   Subsequent observations, however, assured me that this is not the
only form in which the reserve-proteids are present.      I
                                                          found that the
10 per cent. NaCl extract of the seeds contained, in addition to the
globulins, a proteid in solution, which was not precipitated by boiling,
or by saturation with rock-salt, or by dilution with distilled water. This
substance may be isolated by extracting the ground seeds with distilled
water; boiling the extract several times to remove all traces of globulin;
evaporating to small bulk over a water-bath, and allowing the fluid to
filter into absolute alcohol.    As it drops into the alcohol a dense pre
cipitate is formed. The substance which is thus precipitated is readily
soluble in distilled water even after being exposed for months to the
action of alcohol.    Its solution in distilled water does not become
turbid on boiling; it gives a precipitate on the addition of a drop of
HNO3, which is soluble in excess of acid; it gives the xanthoproteic
and Millon's reactions; it gives an immediate precipitate with acetic
acid and potassic ferrocyanide; and it gives a bright pink colour when
treated with excess of strong NaHO solution on the addition of a drop
of dilute CuSO, solution.    The substance does not dialyse. These
properties and reactions indicate that the substance is allied to the
peptones.     It   most nearly resembles the a peptone of Meisoner,      or,

adopting    Kühne's nomenclature (“Verhandl d. Nat.-Med. Vereins zu
Heidelberg,” Band I, 1876), the substance to which he gives the name
of Hemialbumose; a name which may be provisionally applied to this
substance also.
   The proteids stored up in the   seeds of the blue lupin are therefore
of two kinds:
   (1.) Hemialbumose—soluble in distilled water.
   (2.) Globulins—insoluble in distilled water, but soluble in    10  per
cent. NaCl solution.
   In order to determine the exact distribution of these substances in
the cells of the seed, I made a series of micro-chemical observations.
Thin sections of the cotyledons were placed for a few minutes in ether
and then in absolute alcohol, in order to remove the fatty matters
present which would otherwise interfere with the observation.           A
section examined in a drop of absolute alcohol shows the cells filled
with aleurone grains lying in the meshes of a delicate matrix. They
are hyaline or faintly granular, and have a yellowish tint. On adding
a few drops of distilled water the grains become coarsely granular;
the granules gradually disappear, and then vacuoles make their appear
ance.   Further treatment with water produces no apparent change. If
now a few drops of 10 per cent. NaCl solution be added, the hyaline
vacuolated grains at once disappear, and nothing remains in the cells
(when the section is very delicate) but the network of the matrix. A
precipitate may be produced in the fluid under the cover-slip by
diluting it with distilled water. The precipitate assumes the form of
rounded drops of a viscous nature which are readily redissolved on the
addition of NaCl (vegetable vitellin). If the section be irrigated with
10 per cent. NaCl solution until the addition of distilled water pro
duces no precipitate, and if it be then well washed with distilled
water nothing remains within the cells but the matrix.      This is ren
dered conspicuous by adding a drop of solution of iodine which gives
it a bright yellow colour.
   It is well known that aleurone grains consist essentially of proteids,
but the nature of these proteids has not as yet been determined. From
the foregoing observations it appears that at least one proteid is pre
sent which is soluble in water, and one which is insoluble in water but
soluble in 10 per cent. NaCl solution.    The preceding chemical expe
riments suffice to prove  that the former is hemialbumose, and that the
latter includes the two forms of vegetable globulin.
   My observations on the solubility of the aleurone grains of the blue
lupin in water agree in the main with those of Pfeffer (“Unters. iiber
Protein-Körner, &c.     Jahrb. f. Wiss. Bot,” Band VIII, 1872, p. 447),
but  I have been  unable to discover that, as he asserts in the case of
Paeonia and Cynoglossum at least, long continued exposure to alcohol
diminishes their solubility in water. Such treatment affects neither

in 10 per cent. NaCl solution, but it renders the protoplasmic matrix
of the cells quite insoluble in dilute alkaline solutions.         These facts
were established by experiments with grains which had been in alcohol
for three months.
    I have detected    the presence of hemialbumose in the seeds of vetches
and of the hemp and flax plants, and I propose to study the mode of its

    When, about thirty years ago, began to direct my attention to the
 study of the fossil Flora, the knowledge of fossil forms of plants was
 confined almost exclusively to forms of the Palaeozoic formations.         Of
 the  Tertiary  Flora there existed at that time a    very imperfect   concep
 tion; but few beds of Tertiary plants were known, and these had been
 only superficially examined. Leaf-skeletons had not been examined,
 and consequently the characteristic marks upon them were not avail
 able for the purpose of instituting a comparison with the fossil leaves.
 The fossils themselves were only obtained from stones which had been
 exposed to the air, and were easily split asunder, and it was thus im
 possible to arrive at any accurate knowledge of the nature of the old
 world plants.     In fact, parts of one and the same plant were often
 regarded as plants of different genera. Thus on making a closer and
 more careful investigation into the Coal Flora of Bohemia,         I was able
 to show that the     Asterophyllites are the branches, and the Volkmanniae
 the fruits of the Calamites.
    It appeared to me, therefore, necessary that     I should devote myself
 to the study of the so-much-neglected Flora of the Cainozoic forma
 tions. With this object in view,      I determined:—
    Firstly, to collect fossil plants as completely as possible, in order that
 my investigation should produce results on which I might entirely rely.
    Secondly, to improve the method of investigation,         especially with
 regard to the working out of the skeletons of the leaves of living
 plants, so as in that way to acquire sure standpoints from which to
 determine the species of the fossil leaves.
    Thirdly, not to confine the scope of the inquiry within the limits of

mere palaeontological interest, but above all to extend it to the unveil
ing of the history of the development of the whole vegetable kingdom.
                                                              I
    As in studying the Eocene Flora of Great Britain shall follow the
path of the inquiry which        I                   I
                                   originally took, must begin by giving an
account of my method of investigating fossil plants, and           I shall then
explain the results which       I  have obtained.
                  I.—The     Method   of obtaining Fossil Plants.
    It has been usual to collect fossil plants by splitting the pieces of
rocks with a hammer. The more a stone has been exposed to the action
of the weather, the easier it is to break it and lay bare what is within.
But fossil plants found under such circumstances are no longer in good
preservation: they have suffered greatly from exposure to the weather,
and generally only the outlines are visible; their structure and the finest
veins of the leaf-skeleton are lost. Stone when it has not been exposed
to the air is not easily split; the more compact it is the more difficult
it will be found to obtain the fossils in this way. Under favourable
circumstances only fragments of the fossils are obtained.               By the
forcible   splitting  of  pieces   of rocks with a hammer it is   only possible
to succeed very imperfectly in obtaining fossil plants, besides which it
must always be a lucky chance that the hammer strikes that part of
the stone in which the plants lie concealed, and that it has not been
injured by the blow, for a large number of fossils are lost in this way,
or remain undiscovered in the stone.           I have found a method by which
fossil  plants   can be   satisfactorily   got  out of the most compact rocks
 without using a hammer.
    The pieces of rocks are for a considerable time subjected to a
 thorough soaking under the pressure of two or three atmospheres.             In
an iron vessel full of water brought into connexion with a stand-pipe
 the stones are left lying for half a year (most advantageously in summer
 time).   In those places where there is a fossil in the stone the material
 of the stone is not continuous.           Thus numerous, often microscopi
 cally small, splits and other hollow spaces are found along the fossil
plants. These hollow spaces get filled little by little with water. Then
 the stones which have been treated in this manner are exposed to an
 intense cold, -15° to 20° C.             The water in the hollow spaces is
 turned into   ice, and   by  this means the stones are burst asunder on the
 spot where there are petrifactions.            The stones open of themselves,
 and show what      they   contain.    The   more  compact the stone the surer
 and more    complete    by  this method is the successful acquisition of the
 fossil plants.    They show the original state in which they were pre
 served. With very hard stones the soaking and the subsequent
 freezing must be frequently repeated. On the first action of the frost
 the splits and hollow spaces are widened by the formation of ice within
 them to the surface of the stone. These must be quite filled again with

 1878.]              Phyto-Palaeontological     Investigations. .
                                                                             223
 water; the stone will thus be raised to a higher temperature and again
 exposed to the soaking process.         The ice formation and the soaking
 being thus employed alternately, the widening of the splits increases,
 till at last the stone opens of itself exactly along the enclosed fossil,
 which then comes to the light of day uninjured and in the best state of
preservation.
    This method offers not only the advantage of securing for investiga
tion the most complete and well preserved fossil plants, but it yields
also a much larger amount of material than could be obtained by the
old method of forcibly splitting with a hammer. In this way no fossil
can be lost. All the fossil plants in the stones are uninjured.            Luck
and chance are excluded.          To obtain an abundant supply of useful
material for investigation is of the greatest importance for the study
of Phyto-Palaeontology and must lead to better and surer results.
                  II.—Method of Investigating Fossil Plants.
    Phyto-Palaeontologists      have hitherto made too many species.        Un
fortunately authors have been too readily disposed to adopt as a new
species every slightly differing form.       Consequently not only is science
encumbered      by  a useless  burden, but it is itself brought into a discredit
which has occasioned serious injury to the progress of this branch of
science.     The most important way of remedying this evil, lies in
procuring abundant material for investigation, showing a series of
forms, and thus causing the false species to disappear.            A collection
of fossil plants acquired by careful study must therefore contain not only
rare specimens, but as large a number as possible of a series of forms of
common fossils.       These series should be divided into two groups, the
series of the contemporaneous, and of the non-contemporaneous .
(genetic) forms. The first is obtained by the bringing together the
forms    of  a fossil out of the extension of one and the same layer
(horizontal    extension),    the second in the searching for a fossil in
different horizons (vertical extension).        The latter series supplies the
material for the phylogeny of the species, the complete elucidation
of which is of the highest importance for the history of the develop     -
ment of the vegetable world.
    A second way of removing the above-mentioned unsatisfactory state
of things would be to put aside certain obsolete notions and prejudices.
People are prone to admit mere differences of stratigraphical position as
sufficient ground for the acceptance of a particular species, when indeed
there appears to be no substantial reason arising out of its distinctive
character.     Only too often an insignificant difference of form, then re
garded as important, is held to justify the acceptance of a species, if the
fossil belongs to another horizon or another formation. My experience,
however, has led me to the conclusion, that, in many cases, one species
passes through many horizons and indeed through greater periods,

carefully comparing fossil plants with living ones. Unfortunately,                                                               in
this respect,       so
                many faults and mistakes have been committed, that
the greater part              of

revision and correction.    Hitherto the fossils have not been compared
accurately enough with the recent vegetable world.        may    frankly                           It               be
said, that         most      phyto-palaeontologists                    possess      too little botanical
knowledge; how can                     it    be   expected        of   a     novice     botany, that
                                                                                               in                                he
should classify fossil plants correctly,                          if        he    do   not thoroughly know
the living ones?

and  through them the question of the origin of the vegetable kingdom
will receive such an answer as is open to human inquiry.
  How is it possible to discover the genetic connexion of Floras
following each other in immediate succession?
   The successive Floras of different ages are not sharply distinguished
from each  other, but there are the most manifold transitions between
them.    These transitions are to be found in the common species. It
is therefore desirable closely to examine, in the above-mentioned
method, the species most frequently met with, and specially to select
from the different varieties the progressive and retrogressive forms.
By placing together these with other varieties discovered, in a vertical
direction (that             is,

 of much new work,     must       I             be satisfied    refer to  generally, and
                                                                                 to   it

         it   to specialists                to   relieve science from the mistakes which
 have been made.
 I    have        found:—
    Firstly, that all the Floras                 of
                                      the earth stand      genetic connexion    in
 with the Tertiary Flora. These contain the original species              the                               of
 recent Flora and     plant forms         parts  of   all
                                                    the globe.   The   mixing
                                                                       of
 together         of
               forms      plants ofclearly shown, especially
                                            is                   the Miocene                  in
 Flora,      as
             I   first pointed out
                   at                  the Tertiary Flora
                                                 in           Austria.                of
    Secondly, that       each   in         of
                                  the recent Floras are        perceived the        to   be
 elements       their common original Flora. They have, however, been
                  of
 more    less changed, and appear frequently altered into manifold forms.
         or
I  have given the name       “Fiorenglieder” (members
                                      of                        Flora)                        of   a             to

has formed itself through the greater development of one element which
has become the “Haupt-Florenglied” (principal member of a Flora);
such as, for instance, has occurred in the Flora of Australia,” and of the
Cape.t. The rest of the genetic members have remained rudimentary.
The Endemic species of European, Asiatic, and East Indian genera
are, in the above-mentioned Floras, the representatives of these
“Nebenglieder” (secondary members).
   Thirdly, that the species of fossil plants inclined much more to the
formation of varieties than those of living plants, and that the varieties
of the fossil species, for the most part, correspond with the species of
existing Flora.    I have proved this in the case the Pinus palaeo-strobus,
the varieties of which so entirely correspond with many of the recent
Pinus species, that the former must be recognised as the original
forms of the latter.                            I
                        At some future time, hope to publish a demon
stration of the genetic connexion of the varieties of many other
Tertiary plants with species of plants in the living world.
         V.—Results relating   to the Eocene  Flora of Great Britain.
                                            I
   The very extensive materials which have had under examination
were principally those of the collections of the British Museum and
that of Mr. John S. Gardner, and         I have here to express to Mr. H.
Woodward and Mr.        Carruthers,   as well as to Mr. Gardner, my most
grateful thanks for their willing aid.         I  desire, also, especially to
acknowledge my deep obligation to the Royal Society, from which
I  have received a grant for the investigation of the Eocene Flora of
Great Britain.      Mr. Gardner has gained for himself well deserved
acknowledgments for the important services he has rendered in dis
covering and obtaining a vast collection of the Eocene Flora of Great
Britain, and it has given me great satisfaction to have been associated
with him in the study of this fossil Flora.
   As the geology of the localities of the Eocene Flora of Great        Britain
has been already published by Mr. Gardner,        I proceed at once    to those
results which the investigation of this Flora have, up to the           present
time, produced.      These results can only be partially indicated      now, as
the comparing of the fossil Flora of Great Britain with other Floras
will not be published until the investigations are completed. For the
present, the monographic work of the Filices is finished in manuscript.
   The Eocene Flora of Great Britain is distinguished by a series of
tropical forms of ferns. Of these are especially to be named the
peculiar genera of Podoloma and Glossochlamys, which connect them
selves mostly with tropical forms of Polypodium; then the peculiar
genus Menyphyllum most nearly related to the tropical Aspidiaceae.

In addition may be mentioned forms of Chrysodium and Lygodium
The appearance of the genus Gleichenia reminds us of the fern Flora of
the Cretaceous period, while some species of Pteris and Phegopteris are
related to species of the Miocene Flora.   One fern, Asplenites alluso.

    One of the authors of this paper, Mr. Hartley, having studied the
 researches of the late Dr. W. A. Miller “On the Photographic Trans
parency of Various Bodies,” &c. (“Phil. Trans,” 1863, I), and of Pro
fessor Stokes,   “On the Long Spectrum of Electric Light” (“Phil.
 Trans,” 1863,   I), determined to study the action of organic substances
on the ultra-violet spectrum.       In 1872, the apparatus of Dr. Miller
was reconstructed, and some experiments were made which showed
that it was capable of some slight improvements.            Some time was
spent in testing the value of the photographic method of experiment
ing as compared with that adopted by Professor Stokes, and pre
ference was eventually given to the former, or rather to a combina
tion of both methods, since occasional use was made of a focussing
screen either of uranium glass or of white paper steeped in aesculine
solution and dried.       It was soon apparent that a wide field of
investigation was opened, and, with the assistance of Mr. Hunt
ington, a systematic course of examination of organic compounds
was commenced at the beginning of the present year.             In January,
1878, M. Soret published his “Recherches sur l'Absorption des
Rayons     Ultra-Violet par diverses substances” (“Archives des
Sciences   Physiques   et Naturelies, Genève”), which includes the ex
amination of many inorganic and some organic compounds.             Though
this is a work of very great interest, it does not touch upon the sub
ject of the present investigation, namely, the connexion between
chemical constitution and diactinic quality.       M. Soret uses a spectro

                  The Examination of Organic Substances.
  Dr. Miller failed to trace any connexion between the chemical com
plexity of a substance and its actinic absorption.
  With the view of ascertaining whether any such connexion existed
an examination    was made of the normal alcohols, the normal fatty
acids, and a series of ethereal salts.       Great trouble was occasioned by
the interference of minute traces of otherwise undetected impurities,
the presence of which was often unaccountable. Four diagrams, show
ing the relative transparency of different substances, illustrate this
part of the paper, and from the results obtained the following conclu
sions have been drawn.
   (1.) The normal alcohols of the series CnH2n+1OH are remarkable
for transparency to the ultra-violet rays of the spectrum, pure methylic
alcohol being as nearly so as water.
  (2.) The normal fatty acids exhibit a greater absorption of the more
refrangiblerays of the ultra-violet spectrum than the normal alcohols
containing the same number of carbon-atoms.
  (3.) There is an increased absorption of the more refrangible rays
corresponding    to each increment of CH2 in the molecule of the alcohols
and acids.
  (4.) Like the alcohols and acids, the ethereal salts derived from
them are highly transparent to the ultra-violet rays, and do not exhibit
absorption-bands.
  In order to ascertain whether isomeric bodies exhibited similar
or identical    absorption     spectra
                                 a series of benzene derivatives
was examined.    From the  great absorptive power of this class of
substances it was found necessary to use very dilute solutions even
though the cells holding the liquids were not more than 0.75 inch in
thickness. Curves were plotted by taking the proportions of sub
stances in solution as ordinates, and the position    of absorption-bands
as abscissae, and these curves are  highly characteristic features of very
many compounds.       About twenty diagrams have thus been made.
   The  following is a summary of the chief points of interest apper

taining to benzene and   itsderivatives.
   (1.) Benzene, and the hydrocarbons, the phenols, acids, and amines
derived therefrom, are remarkable firstly, for their powerful absorp-.
tion of  the ultra-violet rays; secondly, for the absorption-bands made
          by dissolving them                  alcohol, and diluting; and

different spectra, inasmuch as their absorption-bands vary in position
and in intensity.
   (3.) The photographic absorption spectra can be employed as a
means of identifying organic substances, and as a most delicate test
of their purity. The curves obtained by co-ordinating the extent of
dilution with the position of the rays of the spectrum absorbed by
the solution form a strongly marked and often a highly characteristic
feature of many organic compounds.
   There is a curious feature in connexion with the position of the
absorption bands; at the less refrangible end they either begin at line
12 Cd or line 17 Cd, and those which begin at 12 end a little beyond
17.
   No naphthalene or anthracene derivatives have yet been examined,
and very few substances of unknown constitution—hence         most in
teresting results may be anticipated from a continuation of this
research, and this contribution must be accepted rather as a bare com
mencement of the subject than its conclusion.

  The media,      whose surfaces reflection and refraction are supposed
                   at

Following a slightly different line from his, obtain, by a quaternion                     I
and accompanying Cartesian analysis, the same results as to wave
propagation, reflection, and refraction, as those obtained by M’Cullagh,
and which he developed into the beautiful theorem of the polar plane.
Of course, the resulting laws of wave propagation agree with those
obtained by Professor Maxwell from the same equations by a somewhat
different method.    For isotropic media, the ordinary laws of reflection
and refraction are obtained, and the well-known expressions for the
amplitudes of the reflected and refracted rays.

  perpendicular   to the plane of incidence, the effect of magnetisation is
  to introduce a component into the reflected ray perpendicular to the
  original plane of polarisation, whose amplitude, c, is given in the
  several cases by the following equations, in which i is the angle of
  incidence, and r of reflection, and k a small constant depending prin
  cipally on C, and the intensity of the incident ray:—1. When the
  magnetisation is normal to the reflecting surface.              If the incident ray

     I do not obtain  any change of phase by reflection in any case; and
this is to be   expected,  as this change of phase probably depends on
the nature of the change from one medium to another, which, follow
ing M’Cullagh,     I have uniformly assumed to be abrupt.                Apart from
this question of change of phase, my results conform completely to
Mr. Kerr's beautiful experiments on the reflection of light from the
pole of a magnet, as published              in the Philosophical Magazines         for
May,     1877, and  March,    1878.

    It has often been noticed, especially in and near large towns, that
a  foggy   atmosphere is not always saturated with moisture: thus on
the 17th of October last, at 3:30 p.m., during a thick fog in London,
the degree of humidity was only 80 per cent. of saturation; and
Mr. Glaisher, in his memorable balloon ascents, observed that in
passing through cloud or fog the hygrometer sometimes showed the
air to possess considerable dryness. In the ascent from Wolver.                         ,

passing        through
                  a cloud so dense that the balloon could not be seen
from the  car, the dry bulb thermometer read 37°8 F. and the wet
30°2, indicating a dew point 17°.9 below the air temperature.   Again,
on the 30th   July in the same year, when at an altitude of 6,466 feet,
between the    Crystal  Palace and Gravesend, and whilst the balloon
was passing through a “great mist,” the dew point was 12°.7 F.
below the temperature   of the air. The following is a tabulated state

air in the midst of cloud or fog:—

  It is thus evident that the air closely surrounding the spherules of
water in a mist, cloud or fog, is sometimes far from saturated with
moisture; although, as is well known to persons occupied with gas
analysis, when a perfectly dry gas is admitted into a moist eudiometer
it very rapidly assumes the volume indicating saturation, notwith
standing   that the proportion of water surface to volume of gas is
obviously far less than that afforded to the interstitial air of a fog.
   In a special experiment of this kind, it was found that air dried
over calcic chloride became completely saturated with moisture in less
than one minute and fifty seconds, when it was passed into a moist
glass tube three-fourths of an inch in diameter.      It appeared to me,
therefore, interesting to inquire under what condition the evaporation
from thesurface of water can be so hindered as to cause this delay
in  the
      saturation    the closely surrounding air. Many years ago

    Spence of Manchester, that the evaporation of saline solutions,
    just below their boiling point in open pans, can be almost ent
    prevented by covering the liquid with a thin stratum of coal-tar
    was thus that Mr. Spence effected a considerable saving of fuel in
    part of the process of manufacturing alum in which burnt alumi
    shale is digested for many hours with hot dilute sulphuric
    much less fuel being of course required when the digestion
    carried on without evaporation, than when steam escaped from
    surface of the hot liquid. This simple though important tech

    Experiments were also  made with single drops of water suspended
in  loops of fine platinum wire, and placed in the bell-jar filled with
dry air; but it was found that the oily film had a strong tendency to
leave the drop and run up the platinum wire.         In a comparative
experiment, in which one of the drops was protected by a coal-smoke
film, the unprotected drop lost 90 per cent. of its weight in two and
a  half hours at 16°6 C.; whilst the protected drop lost only 37.8
per cent at 17°.8 C. in the same time. Another drop, protected by a
film of coal-tar, lost 37.6 per cent of    weight        its

          CONROY, Bart., M.A.  Communicated by Professor G.
          STOKES, Sec. R.S. Received November 18, 1878.
     In the experiments made by Sir David Brewster, M. Jamin, I
fessor Haughton, and others, on the light reflected by polished meta
surfaces, the reflecting surfaces were in contact with air; and, as
     I
as am aware, the only observations which have been made when
reflecting surfaces were in contact with other media are those
Quincke, an account of which is given in “Poggendorff's Annal
vol. cxxviii, p. 541, and in the “Jubelband,” p. 336. He found
he obtained different values for the principal incidence and p
cipal azimuth, according as the reflecting surface of a film of si
was in contact with air, crown glass, flint glass, water, or turpent
and that the only connexion between the values of these angles
the refractive index of the medium in which the reflexion took p
was, that in general with the same metal, the principal incidence
the principal azimuth                   became         less as the refractive      index of
medium increased.
     I
     therefore hope that a short account of some attempts that     h                         I
recently made to determine the principal incidence for, and the p
cipal azimuth of, the light reflected by polished surfaces of gold
copper in contact with different media, may be of interest.

 wheels    to the pinion being such that, on moving the telescope arm,
 the vertical stage also moved in the same direction, but with half the
angular velocity; so that when the reflecting surface had been pro
perly adjusted, the light which passed along the axis of the tube fixed
to the collimator arm, was reflected along the axis of that fixed to the
telescope arm, at all angles of incidence.
     A quarter
             undulation plate was placed at the inner end of the tube
fixed to the collimator arm, and a small direct vision spectroscope,
with a photographic scale, could be attached to the other tube. The
lower edge of the vertical stage being some distance above the gra
duated circle of the goniometer, a cylindrical vessel of thin glass,
about 6 centims. in diameter, could be placed on the horizontal stage,
so as to surround  the lower part of the reflecting surface; this being
filled with the liquid, and a narrow vertical slit placed so as to limit
the incident light, fairly good observations could be made when the
reflecting surface was in contact with various liquids.
   When the principal section of the first or polarizing nicol was in
clined at an angle of 45° to the plane of incidence, and one of the
neutral axes of the quarter undulation plate placed in that plane,
the transmitted light was elliptically polarized; and at a particular
incidence, varying with    refrangibility,

 were determined directly, but less accurately than by Dr. Wi
 mann's arrangement, which, however, involves a good deal of
 culation.
    The analysing portion of Dr. Wiedemann's instrument appear
 differ merely by the addition of a small direct vision spectroscope f
 the Elliptic Analyser of Professor Stokes, described in the “Repo!
 the British Association for 1851,” Part II, p. 14.
    The experiments were made with sun-light and with lamp-lig
 with the former, the angle of incidence and the azimuth of the
 lysing nicol were altered till the dark band in the spectrum was 1
 intense at certain definite positions, as measured by the scale of
 spectroscope; with the latter, till the light which had passed thro
 a piece of red glass was reduced to a minimum.
    Numerous measurements were made of both these angles wit
 plate of gold in air, water, carbon bisulphide, and carbon tetrachlor
and of copper, in air, water, and carbon tetrachloride; but the res
 were not very satisfactory.      In addition to the difficulty of de
 mining accurately the zero of the nicols, and of placing the neu
 axis of the quarter undulation plate in the plane of incidence,    I fo
 that very different values were obtained for the principal incide
according as one or other of the neutral axes of the quarter undula
plate   I was using was in the plane of incidence.
    In all cases, however, the principal incidence which, as is
known, is less for the more refrangible rays, diminishes, and the p
cipal azimuth increases with the increase of the refractive inde.
the medium in contact with the metallic surface; and further,
diminution in the value of the principal incidence appears to be ne
in proportion to the increase of the refractive index of the surrou
ing medium.
    The decrease of the principal incidence, with an increase in
refractive index of the surrounding medium, is exactly what migh
expected to take place if the principal incidence for a metal were
same as the angle of polarization of a transparent substance; tha
the angle whose tangent is equal to the refractive index.
    If such is the case, the metals must all have very high refrac
indices; but some experiments of Quincke's (“Pogg. Ann,” vol. c
p. 379, and vol. cxx, p. 602) appear to show that their refractive ind
are less than 1.
    The following are some results    I obtained with a gold plate (for
by soldering a slip of thin sheet gold to a brass plate), in air, w
lamp-light, a deep red glass being interposed; the position of
quarter undulation plate in which the ray polarized perpendicularl.
the plane of incidence was retarded relatively to the other, be

plate; and, to confirm this, the light transmitted by the nicol and
plate was examined with an Iceland spar, cut to show the rings.
   The azimuths are reckoned as positive when measured from the
plane of incidence in the direction in which the hands of a watch
move, to a person supposed to be so placed as to receive the light,
whether incident or reflected, into his eye.

   A rectangular       glass trough was placed on the horizontal stage of
the goniometer so as to surround the gold plates; the trough filled
with water, and the principal incidence and the azimuth observed.
   The ray of light which had been twice reflected by the plates being
parallel to the incident ray, and the trough having been placed with its
front perpendicular to the direction of the incident light, the polariza
tion of the ray could not be altered in any way by the glass, as indeed
was verified by experiment.
   The light having           been        twice     reflected, the square root of the
tangent of the angle which the plane of polarization of the reflected
ray makes with the plane of incidence, is equal to the tangent of
the principal azimuth.

method from eight observations, four with the plane of polarization
of the incident light on either side of the plane of incidence are–

   Rollett, in 1858,” in a memoir on connective tissue, described the
results of an elaborate investigation into the structure of the corium.
Microscopic examination of leather, and of skin tanned by himself,
had shown him that the connective tissue bundles of the corium are
made up of smaller divisions, and that these latter are again made up
of the previously known minute connective tissue fibrillae, which are
so small that their diameter can only be approximately estimated at
0.0002 to 0.0003 millim. From the connective tissue bundles of the
skin of the ox, “treated by lime or baryta water, there can,” he states,
“be isolated from each bundle a number of component elements which
have a considerably larger diameter than the minute fibres known as
connective tissue fibrillae.” These elements have, he remarks, in the
ox a thickness of 0.003–0.006 millim., and he proposes to call them
connective tissue fibres (Bindegewebsfaser). In a plate attached to
his memoir the bundles and their divisions are shown in a very dis
tinct manner.
  This observation         of Rollett's has not arrested      the attention     of
anatomists to the degree which might have been expected, and seems,
indeed, to have been to a great extent neglected. Two of the latest
standard works may be quoted in illustration of this remark.        W.
Krause, in a volume on “General and Microscopic Anatomy,” pub
lished in 1876, describes the tissue of the corium proper as being com
posed    of    “a network of    strong bundles of connective tissue closely
interwoven,        the bundles being partly cylindrical, partly flattened.”
There    is    nothing said about the subdivision of the bundles, as described
by  Rollett.
   The same author, in his chapter on connective tissue, states, “that
the ground substance of fibrous tissue consists of closely-packed, very
fine, round connective tissue fibrillae, measuring 0.0002–0.002 millim.”
The larger of these measurements is inapplicable to the fibrilla of
Rollett, and is so near that of the subdivision or “fibre” of that
author, that it is evident that Krause does not recognise the distinc
tion between the fibre and the fibrilla established by the former his
tologist.
  In Quain’s “Anatomy”f it is stated, “that the corium is made up
of an exceedingly strong and tough framework of interlaced connec
tive tissue fibres with blood-vessels and lymphatics.          The fibres are

 with half per cent. chloride of gold solution.          From time to time
 different thicknesses of the     fatty layer were removed as the solution
 had had time to penetrate into the tissue, until finally the deeper layer.
 of the cutis proper was laid bare. The tissue, still extended, was then
 placed in fresh gold solution for several hours.         The object of the
 manoeuvre was to secure the penetration of the fluid through the
 bundles, whilst these were still extended in their natural condition.
    After a due action of the gold, the skin was cut into small pieces,
which were then treated by acetic and formic acids in various degrees
of dilution. Some of the portions were exposed to sunlight for several
days, in water feebly acidulated with acetic acid, and then the
strength of the acetic acid was raised to 20 per cent of the ordinary
concentrated acetic acid of commerce. Other portions were treated
by formic acid.        Some successful preparations were obtained from
portions macerated first for a few days in a mixture of one part formic
acid, of specific gravity 1.020, and one of water, and then in the
undiluted acid for some days longer, but a strict adherence to these
strengths was not found necessary.
    Portions of the corium thus prepared were teased out in glycerine
and examined, directly or after staining by different dyes.           Staining
by pikric acid    I found  very  advantageous.
    I was able to isolate, in a condition favourable for study, the primary,
secondary, and tertiary bundles.          Generally speaking, although not
invariably, the tertiary and secondary bundles were best seen in the
tissues macerated in acetic acid, and the secondary and primary
bundles in those treated by formic acid.
    Numerous elastic fibres were isolated by both methods, the finest
fibres more particularly in the formic acid preparations.         These fibres
were     frequently  found  only  partially detached from the    bundles,  and
in such preparations the relations of the fibres to the bundles could be
well studied. The primary bundles isolated by these methods were
flattened, cylindrical elements, even contoured, homogeneous in appear
ance, and uniform in breadth over the whole length isolated.              The
difference in breadth between individual bundles was        very  slight.   By
measurement,      I  found that   they  were from 0.004 to 0.005 millim.
broad.      The primary bundles were sometimes seen in situ, that is to
say, as parts of a secondary bundle, the breadth of the latter being
normal.      In other preparations the contours of secondary and tertiary
bundles were     lost, and the microscopic field was filled with a large
number of     primary   bundles, entangled and twisted by the needles used
in teasing them out. Sometimes a number of primary bundles,
although separated from each other, were yet so placed that            I could
feel assured that they were the constituent elements of one secondary
bundle.      Such was the case with the primary bundles shown in
 fig. 4.

fig. 7,  but the fibres are in reality more delicate than is shown in the
drawing.
    The dark very finely granular deposit produced by the reduction of
the gold chloride had a special relation to the elastic fibres, which was
best observed in portions of skin which had been macerated for a
longer period in 20 per cent. acetic acid. This relation will be under
stood by reference to figs. 3, 6, 9, and 10.               Strictly defined narrow
strips of this deposit were found investing the fibres, and this so
closely that it was only at points where it had been disturbed in the
preparation that the fibre itself could be observed.
    The appearances reproduced in figs. 3 and 10, in which fibres are
seen   with deposit still adherent, illustrate this point very strikingly.
    In gold preparations large flat oval nuclei are sometimes seen
adherent to the surface of the bundle.               The nuclei have the charac         *** --
teristic slate colour, and around the nucleus a small ill-defined patch
of gold deposit is seen.
    This deposit could sometimes be seen to be continuous with that
surrounding an elastic fibre. This is shown in fig. 10.                       There is
no reason to believe that in such cases more of the cell than the nucleus
has been preserved, or         that the gold deposit has any special relation
to cellular substance *            The distinctly localised character of the
deposit around the elastic fibres supports the idea that the larger ones
are surrounded by an albuminous fluid, of a like nature to that shown
by gold preparations,        to be present between the laminae of the cornea.
    Isolated tertiary bundles completely surrounded by elastic fibres
 (fig. 5), are sometimes seen.
                                 I
     The “spiral” fibre, as have seen it on the bundles of the skin, is
an elastic fibre that encircles the bundles like a ring; and it may con
 tinue to do so after the ring has been detached from other fibres, none
of which, indeed, may be found in the isolated bundle.
    The nature of the spiral fibre is still considered by some histologists
as undecided, and Ranvier regards its behaviour under picro-carminate
staining as against the view that it is an elastic fibre. In the prepara
tion drawn in fig. 8, which had been stained by picro-carminate, a
typical spiral fibre was distinctly stained yellow by the pikric acid,
and was not stained by the carmine, behaving in this respect exactly
 like any other elastic fibre.
     Confirmation of Rollett's views as to the structure of the bundles
 is occasionally found in bichromate of potash preparations of skin.
 Part of one of the most demonstrative preparations of this kind
    * In a paper read    before the Royal Society in 1874 (“Proceedings,” No. 155,
1874),  I followed  the view held by some histologists, that the gold deposit in such
preparations is indicative of cellular protoplasm, and described and figured (fig. 13)
an anastomosis    of cells in the skin by means of elastic fibres.  As will be observed
from the remarks in the text,    I  now interpret these appearances quite differently.

   The specimen is from the skin of the horse, and was thus prep
A portion of fresh skin, free of panniculus adiposus, was hard
first in weak and then in stronger solutions of the bichromate,
treated by gum and alcohol before being cut. The deep edge o
sections—the part of the tissue that had been in direct contact
the bichromate solution—showed the structure of the bundles be
    The transverse sections of many of the bundles were cut up i
mosaic of somewhat rounded polygonal fields (fig. 1b and fig. 2)
measurements across each field varying from 0-0037 to 0.005 m
Oblique and longitudinal sections of the bundles showed that
fields were sections of primary bundles.  The mosaic was not eq
distinct in all the bundles, even in parts where the appearance
well brought out. This varying distinctness is seen in fig. 1.
  The sections of the primary bundles being rounded there are :
angular spaces between them. These have not been successfully sl
in the drawing.
  In this preparation a delicate connective tissue was found bet
the bundles of the corium in a well marked form.   Its extent relat
to the bundles will be best understood by reference to the draw
As seen in the preparation it was distinctly fibrillar at parts.
  The cells seen in the preparation were in two positions.       Sor
them were found in the delicate tissue between the bundles;
cells were found in direct connexion with the bundles. Of the                       l
cells the greater number seen were applied to the surface of
bundles, but others were found in the substance of the bundles bet
the primary bundles.
   These cells were all of the endothelial type. In all of them
cell-contour was clearly marked, and in none of those observed
there a trace of a process, or of ridges and depressions similar to t
described by some histologists in tendon.    The size and form of
cells is accurately shown in fig. 1, and will be better appreciate
reference to the drawing than by any detailed description whi
could give.

geneous    ground substance seen in the other preparations, a typical
hyaline cartilage, with a large proportion of so-called cartilage cells,

 A   few years   back Bernard introduced,    for physiological purposes,                                                         a

with reduction and the  non-precipitation        the reduced oxide.     The    of

and the presence     the product
                               in           tested          a

matter.          Under these circumstances                     it   happens that the reduced sub
oxide    is   held     in   solution     instead             of   being allowed     fall, and thus  to
decoloration without precipitation occurs and enables the point                                                              of

cision. Bernard,      his remarks upon the test, simply made mention
                               in
of  the fact that under these conditions, reduction without precipita
tion took place, but Dr. d’Arsonval,” his Préparateur     the College                                at                      of

organic matter    presencein                  of    the alkali.
  Whilst engaged upon                        an   inquiry into the merits
                                                          this test, the                             of
conclusion  suggested itself      me that the  agency
                                                  to    preventing   the
deposition    the suboxide was the development
                  of                                  ammonia.     With                        of

more marked manner with honey, interference with precipitation                                                               is

                                    in
of nitrogenous organic matter incidentally present.
  With this before me, the idea presented itself    resorting the                               of                    to

Fehling's solution, and    if it  comported itself in the same manner as
the latter, 10 cub. centims      of it would stand equivalent to 005 grn.
of grape sugar.      In working with this liquid the results obtained
were so accordant in relation to each other that        I had no misgiving
about its  uniformity   of  action;   but I felt that before being definitely
accepted they ought to be checked against known amounts of sugar.
The accomplishment of this proceeding, however, is not altogether
unattended with difficulty, on account of the uncertainty of obtaining
grape sugar free from impurity and in a perfectly dried state.
   The method     I   have adopted has been to operate upon weighed
amounts of cane    sugar   and produce inversion by boiling with an acid.
I first found that the cane sugar, which is sold in coarse colourless
crystals—that which is known as “white crystal,” and used for
sweetening coffee—stood the test on examination for purity with
Laurent's polarimeter.       A weighed quantity was taken, and, after
being inverted by boiling with hydrochloric acid, the acid neutralised,
and the liquid brought to a known volume, subjected to treatment
with the ammoniated copper liquid.          Repeated trials were made with
varying quantities, and it was found that the results stood in har
monious relation to each other, but that the amount of sugar indicated
was larger than the calculated amount of invert sugar from the
                                                       I
weighed quantity of cane sugar taken. At first was at a loss for an
explanation of this result, but subsequent observation has revealed
that in the case of the ammoniated liquid, 6 atoms of oxide of copper
are  appropriated by 1 atom of sugar, instead of 5, as in that of
Fehling's solution used in the ordinary way. When the reckoning is
made upon this basis the results exactly correspond with the actual
amount of sugar known to be present. Moreover, with solutions of
ordinary grape sugar and diabetic sugar, examined comparatively with
Fehling's solution used in the ordinary way and the ammoniated
copper liquid, the results exactly accord under the reckoning that 5
atoms   of oxide of copper are appropriated in the one case and 6 atoms
in the other by 1 atom of sugar.
   To be quite satisfied upon this point, a large number of observations
under varying conditions have been made, and whilst what              I  have
stated holds    good   for the ammoniated       copper liquid prepared  from
Fehling's solution, without any further addition of alkali, and with
the addition of potash to the extent of 1 grm. to 20 cub. centims. of
the ammoniated test, yet a larger quantity of potash alters the action,
and with 5 grns., and anything beyond, the behaviour is brought to
the same as that of Fehling's solution used in the ordinary way, viz.,
5 atoms only of oxide of copper are appropriated by 1 atom of sugar.
 With quantities of potash between the 1 and 5 grims, the results
stand between the 5 and 6 atoms of cupric oxide.
   I  may mention that observation has further shown that whilst

made with the ammoniated copper liquid coincide with thos
with Fehling's solution without the presence      ammonia,                     of                         a

    Conclusions.—1. That, in young dogs, the protoplasmic constituent
of the grey matter contracts en masse under the influence of strong
faradaic currents.
   2. That it contracts unequally and irregularly by reason of its un
equal and irregular sectional area, causing thereby condensations at
certain points—notably in the anterior horns and around the central
canal—and rarefaction at others—notably in the middle of each
crescent; such rarefaction going on sometimes to rupture of tissues.
    3. That nerve-corpuscles contract in various degrees according to
the strength and duration of currents, and that while they tend in
contraction to become spherical they also tend to become vacuolated.
   4. That the vessels are in some places strongly contracted and
empty; in others dilated and filled with blood clot, having the appear
ance of embolus.
    5. That the appearances correspond so decidedly with appearances
in chorea and tetanus as to give ground for the supposition that con
tractions, such as are produced by electricity, do actually occur during
life under the effect of nervous shock, and may     be phenomena    causal
or associate of disease.

    The principal bulk of the paper is devoted to a full consideration of
numerous facts and inferences relating to the phenomena of what the
author terms “artificial rhythm.”       Some of these facts have already
been    published   in abstract in the “Proceedings of the Royal
Society” (vol. xxv), and to explain those which have not been
published would involve more space than it is here desirable to allow.
 The tendency of the whole research on artificial rhythm, as produced
in various species of Medusae, is to show that the natural rhythm of
these animals (and so probably of ganglio-muscular tissues in general)
is due, not exclusively to the intermittent nature of the ganglionic

haustion and restoration of excitability on the part of the responding
tissues—the ganglionic period coinciding with that during which the
process of restoration lasts, and the ganglionic discharge being thus
always thrown in at the moment when the excitability of the respond

     The conception      of a chemical equivalent as employed in these
researches      corresponds   to a definition first given” by one of us, viz.,
that the chemical equivalent of a body is that weight of it which does
the unit of work. We do not therefore use the term in its ordinary
 sense; as, for example, when it is said that H is “equivalent” to Cl,
 Na, &c.
     The following experiments were arranged with the view of determin
 ing the effect of potassic and sodic sulphates on the rate of formation of
 ammonia, when nascent hydrogen is made to act on potassic nitrate.
 Judging from their behaviour in other cases, it was expected that in
 this instance, also, their action would be one of retardation.        Experi
 ment, however, has proved the reverse, on the whole, to be true.
     The extremely delicate nature of the reaction, which is liable to be
 spoiled by the accidental falling in of a single speck of dust, or by
 slight variation of temperature, or unequal exposure of the different
 solutions to light, rendered the attempt to measure the effect a matter
  of peculiar difficulty.
     At  first, common sheet zinc, thoroughly cleansed from grease, was
 placed in a solution of potassic nitrate and hydrate, and the amount of
  ammonia formed during periods varying from twenty-four hours to one
  week was measured. But the results were very irregular and unsatis
  factory.     Galvanic couples seemed to be established at certain points
  on the surface of the zinc, probably due to the presence of iron or lead
  as impurities.      Thin zinc foil was next tried, but with little better
  result; neither were any alterations in the shape or disposition of the
  foil attended with success.        Fresh experiments were also undertaken
  with sodium amalgam instead of zinc and potassic nitrate; but the
  action, though rather more uniform, was still very uncertain.         It was
  found impossible to obtain a perfectly homogeneous solution of sodium
   in mercury, entirely free from sodic oxide and hydrate; and this
   seriously impaired the accuracy of measuring out the amalgam.
      The only plan which was found to give results at all comparable
   with each other, was using zinc amalgam and potassic nitrate.           The
   experiments were performed in wide-mouthed glass-stoppered bottles
   of cylindrical shape, having an internal diameter of 60 mm., and a
   total capacity of 315 cub. centims.          Each bottle contained 1 grim.

potassic nitrate, 1 grm. potassic hydrate (prepared from the sulphate
by means of baryta water), and a quantity of anhydrous alkaline
sulphate, varying from 0 to 1 grm.; the whole being dissolved in
150 cub. centims. of distilled water, very free from ammonia.     The
reagents had been carefully purified.    30 cub. centims of amalgam,
prepared by dissolving 10 grims. zinc in 10 kilogs. mercury, were then
added, and the “system” was preserved from dust and light. After
twenty hours, the amount of ammonia was estimated by Nessler's
method.    Traces of this substance were occasionally present in
the solutions employed, and a corresponding correction had to be
made.        In
            every experiment, nine solutions were prepared at the same
time—three free from sulphate, three containing sodic sulphate, and
three potassic sulphate; and the mean of each three was taken as the
true value for that particular experiment.     Fifteen comparisons of
each of nine solutions, arranged in this way, were made with different
quantities of sulphate. The temperature was taken at the beginning,
in the middle, and at the conclusion of the experiment; the tempera
ture at night being registered by one of the automatic thermometers
sold by Negretti and Zambra.     Owing to the extreme delicacy of the
reaction and the slight causes which suffice to interfere with        the                                     it,

270                   Prof. E.       J. Mills      and      J.    Hogarth.                   [Jan. 23,
   The ratio of the working effect of sodic to that of potassic sulphate,
as calculated from the numbers given above, is 100:16 : 100, with a
probable uncertainty of 1.3 per cent. This is the mean value, reckoned
by the method of least squares, from the whole of the observations.
The rejection of the four experiments marked with an asterisk, which
differ somewhat widely from the rest, would give the ratio 99.53 : 100,
with a probable uncertainty of 0.73 per cent.; while the probable error
of a single observation would then be reduced from 5:02 to 24 per
cent. [Owing to the number of determinations made, any error in the
result is but very slightly affected by error in the ammonia estimation.]
   The conclusions which we think may fairly be drawn from these
numbers    are:
    (1.) That sodic and potassic sulphates have  a well-marked influence
      on the reaction to which we have referred;
    (2.) That as more sulphate is added, the reaction is accelerated;
    (3.) That equal weights of sodic and potassic sulphates have as
      nearly as possible the same working effect.
    The last conclusion may be otherwise expressed thus:—
    If we represent  our equivalent of potassic sulphate by a number, then
the equivalent   of sodic sulphate is represented by the same number.

the mark.    To prevent evaporation during heating, the neck of the
flask was left long, and a narrow bent tube attached by an india
rubber joint.   The time was accurately noted when the flask was
placed in the bath.    After half an hour, the flask was taken out
quickly, plunged into cold water, and the contents when cold trans
ferred to the polarimeter tube. The tube used in the researches on
lactin had to be modified in these experiments, the cement not being
able to withstand the action of the acid.     In its altered form, the
plate glass covers were secured by two screw rods and nuts, a thin
washer of gutta-percha tissue being placed between the ends of the
tube and the plates. This washer did not materially affect the length
of the column, and made the tube perfectly tight. The length of the
tube was thus reduced to 216 millims.

       F.R.S., “Young” Professor of Technical Chemistry in An

       December 4, 1878.
    Although lactin, or sugar of milk, has been investigated by nume
rous chemists, there are many problems connected with it which still
await solution.      We have accordingly undertaken a series of experi
ments    in connexion with this remarkable compound, in the hope, not
only of obtaining special results, but such as may be made available
in studies of a more general nature.          As our work throughout has
been for the most      part   optical as well as chemical, we have first to
state our methods of obtaining the constant of Jellett's polarimeter,
the instrument employed in our investigations.
    I. Determination of the Polarimeter's Constant—a. By quinine sul
phate.     5:5412 grms. of the sulphate were dissolved in water acidu
lated with hydric sulphate, and the solution made up to 100 cub.
centims.      The average of five readings gave a solution of -25° 73,
equivalent to a specific rotatory        power   of –232° 16. De Gris and
Alluard* give —255°6,         a number which    is to our experimental num
ber as 1*10096 to 1.
   8. By cane sugar. Three sets of experiments on solutions contain
ingrespectively 16:3500, 81750, and 4,0875 grms. in 100 cub. centims.,
and embracing five, four, and four readings, gave a general mean
reading 21°74, equivalent to a specific rotation 66°48.
   This is to the generally accepted number (73°8) as 1 to 1-11011.
   7. By salicin. Two sets of experiments with solutions containing
respectively 4.9156 and 2.4578 grms. in 100 cub. centims, and each
embracing three readings, gave a general mean reading 4°92, equal to
a  specific rotation 50° 046. Bouchardatt gives 55°832, which is to
the number     got by Jellett's instrument as 1.11561 to 1.
   The    average  of the three numbers, 1.10096, 1-11011, and 1.11561,
gives 1:10889 as an experimental factor for converting our Jellett
readings    into ordinary readings.
   The relation of the two scales may also           be seen   by examining   the
arc divided to read percentages       of cane sugar with      a solution contain
ing 16:35     grns. in  100 cub. centims.      In    the  Jellett instrument, an
arc   of 21°.666 is divided into hundredths for this purpose; and as
16:35 grims. pure cannose read 100 on this scale, the specific rotation

         is 66°-256, which is to    73°.8 as 1 to 1-11386—a factor wh:
         from the above   experimental   one by 0.45 per cent.

1879.]                                    Researches on Lactin.                                             275
were made at intervals of 2 hours, the results being given                                             under
Table I, No. 21.
                                                      See Table        I.
   In order to increase the total change and lessen proportionally the
error of experiment, it became necessary to use a stronger solution, to
increase the length of column, and to reduce the interval elapsing
between first contact and first observation as far as possible.      To
attain these conditions the   following method was    adopted:—About
10 grms. of powdered lactin were rubbed in a mortar with about
60 cub. centims. of water for half an hour, the solution filtered, and
the first observation taken one hour after first contact.  The metal
tube belonging to the polariscope was also discarded, and a glass one
constructed from a piece of tubing 17 millims. wide, by sealing on a side
piece for the introduction of a thermometer, and grinding the ends
carefully until it measured 242 millims., the greatest length admitted
by the polarimeter.    Two glass disks were cemented on the ex
tremities, and the tube covered from end to end by a helix of thin tin
tubing, through which a current of water might be passed to keep the
temperature constant; to guard further from variations in temperature
the tube was covered with cotton wadding.    With these precautions
three experiments   were made (Table I, Nos. 1, 2, 3), the result being
that the total  change  was nearly doubled.     In all the other experi
ments the method was     slightly  varied, the lactin being placed in a

   This break in the change seems to point to the dual nature of lactin
 mentioned       by Fudakowski,” whose experiments show that lactin, like
 cannose,   gives       two glucoses—lacto glucose and galactose.
   An increase of temperature evidently hastens the change; but the
 exact relation of temperature to the rate of change has not been dis
 covered.
   The presence of sodic or potassic chloride increases the amount of
 lactin in solution, but has no apparent effect on the rate of change.
     IV. Action of Hydric Nitrate on Lactin.—We made an attempt to
 trace this action, but did not succeed in overcoming experimental
 difficulties.      The first of    these was the          impossibility of completing the
 action  with the quantity of acid required for the first change. If a

  larger quantity of acid were       used, the first changes were so rapid as to
  evade measurement; moreover, the oxalic acid formed, by crystallizing
  in the acid liquid, made accurate observation impossible.              By adding
  the acid in small successive        portions,     we nevertheless succeeded in
  obtaining an outline of the reaction, of which the curve drawn below
  is an accurate general expression.

     Dubrunfaut, who has also examined this action,” asserts that the
  rotatory power first rises to # of the original amount, then falls
  gradually to zero, again rises to # of the original rotation, and once
  more falls to zero: the highest rotation corresponding to galactose,
  the first point of inactivity to mucic acid; the second rise probably to
  dextro-tartaric acid; and the second fall to the formation of oxalic
  acid. Our experiments show the formation of a laevo-rotatory sub
  stance, perhaps laevo-tartaric acid. The general form of the curve
   constitutes it an interesting and novel addition to chemical curves.
     V.  Note on  Solubility.—The mutual relations of water and lactin in
  solution   undergo   a change upon which the change of rotation most
  probably depends. Water shaken with a large quantity of very finely
  powdered lactin at a temperature of 17°C., takes up a quantity of
  lactin corresponding to a solubility of 1 part lactin in 10-64 parts
  water.    With four hours' contact, the solubility increases to             1 part
  lactin in 7:49    parts    water. The      permanent     solubility  got    by  the
  analysis of the mother-liquor of lactin crystallized over oil of vitriol is
  1 part lactin in 3:23 parts water.        In the solution of the lactin a fall
  of  temperature    of 0°.45 C. was observed.           Pohlt also found a de
  pression of temperature (0°88 C.); while Dubrunfaut alleges that
  heat is evolved.
                                     Conclusions.
     I. The initial specific rotation of lactin is 92°63.
     II. The permanent specific rotation of lactin is 59°17.

been called in this country transpiration, while in other countries no
distinct name has been adopted; and as the English word is already
in use in French for another purpose, and properly applies to gases
(the laws relating to which are quite different), the author proposes
to use for liquids the term “Microrheosis,” from ukpós and few, the
instrument being called the microrheometer.     The form of apparatus
which the author     finally adopted is figured in the paper, and is so
arranged that when the liquid is introduced, as many experiments as
may be desired may be tried, and the pressure and temperature, as
well as the atmosphere in which the experiment is conducted, may be
varied, while the thermometer indicating the temperature is at the
mean point of the system. The author gives a curve for water from
0° to 100°, the differences of rate being smaller as the temperature
rises.
   Various salts are then examined, being dissolved to form “normal”
solutions; but as the solubility of some salts is too low for such solu
tions, the effect of the amount of salts dissolved is determined.    This
is found to be   directly proportional to the amount of salt in solution.
Values for many salts in solution are then given, each number being
the mean of ten experiments, and the probable error of the mean is
calculated in each case. The conclusions arrived at are these. The
rate of flow does not depend on any of the “mechanical” features of
the salt, such as crystalline form, specific volume, solubility, &c.; but
upon the mass of the elements forming the substance and the amount
of energy expended in its formation.    Each element has a value of its
own, which is continued in all its compounds. Thus     the salts             all              of
potassium and sodium formed              by
                                the same acids have constant diffe     a
rence. In like manner each metalloid and acid radicle has    value                   a
which  iscontinued    all its combinations. Then the greater the com
                      an in
bining value   of      element the quicker       its microrheosis; thus
                                                               is
potassium has     higher rate than sodium, barium than strontium,
                  a
strontium than calcium, and     on. so The microrheosis also varies with
the amount   of energy     the compound;
                              in           thus nitrates stand highest,
as they contain most energy; then chlorides; and, lastly, sulphates,
which are exhausted compounds.

fifths (#) of the whole; much of this is probably remelted sediments
and some of the granites the product of metamorphism.
   From considerations stated at length it is estimated that the area
of exposures of igneous to sedimentary rocks would be for all geo
logical time liberally averaged at one-tenth (T,) of the whole.
    These igneous rocks are either the original materials of the globe
protruded upwards, or they are melted sediments or a mixture of the
two.
   The only igneous rocks we know of are of the nature of granites
and traps. If these rocks do not constitute the substratum of the
earth, and all known rocks, igneous as well as sedimentary, are deriva
tive, either geological time is infinite, or the rock from which they
are derived         is,

this way the vertical currents in the solar atmosphere, both ascending
and descending, intense absorption in sun-spots, their association with
 the faculae, and the apparently continuous spectrum of the corona and
 its structure, find an easy solution.
    We are yet as far as ever from a demonstration of the cause of the
 variation in the temperature of the sun; but the excess of so-called
 calcium with minimum sun-spots, and excess of so-called hydrogen
with maximum sun-spots follow naturally from the hypothesis, and
afford indications that the temperature of the hottest region in the
sun closely approximates to that of the reversing layer in stars of the
type of Sirius and a Lyrae.
    If it be conceded that the existence of these lines in the chromo
 sphere indicates the existence of basic molecules in the sun, it follows
 that as these lines are also seen generally in the spectra of two different
 metals in the electric arc, we must be dealing with the bases in the
arc also.

I. “On the Effect of Heat on the Di-iodide of Mercury, HgI.”
       By G. F. RoDWELL, Science Master, and H. M. ELDER, a
       Pupil, in Marlborough College. Communicated by Pro
       fessor TYNDALL, F.R.S., Professor of Natural Philosophy in
       the Royal Institution. Received January 9, 1879.
    In continuation of the experiments on the effects of heat on the
chloride, bromide, and iodide of silver, which one of us has previously
had the honour of communicating to the Society,” it was thought to
be advisable to search in some of the other metallic iodides for mole
cular anomalies similar to those presented by the iodide of silver.
Among these       no substance appeared more likely to possess such
anomalies than the di-iodide of mercury.           This substance, as is well
known, is dimorphous.        In the amorphous condition it presents the
appearance of a brilliant scarlet powder, which, if heated, fuses at
200° C., and volatilises just above the fusing point to a vapour more

 than twice as dense as that of mercury. The vapour condenses to
 rhombic prismatic crystals, which frequently become scarlet while
 cooling, but which, if they still remain yellow when cold, instantly
 become scarlet   if rubbed   or otherwise mechanically agitated.  Accord
 ing to Warington this change is due to the transformation of the
 rhombic prisms into acute square-based octohedrons with truncated
summits.      If the yellow prismatic crystals are placed under the
 microscope,    and are then touched, the change to the red variety may
be observed to go on through the mass of contiguous crystals, accom
panied by a slight movement, but the external form of the crystals
 remains unchanged, consequently pseudomorphous crystals are pro
duced, and the larger rhombic prisms have been resolved into a mass
of minute octohedrons. Frankenheim asserts that by the application
of a very gentle heat, both the red and the yellow crystals may be
sublimed together, and he believes that the vapour of the yellow
crystals passes off at a lower temperature than that of the red.
Warington      found that the precipitate produced by iodide of potas
sium in chloride of mercury, appeared under the microscope to be
composed of rhombic laminae, which gradually altered their form by
the truncation of the edges, until they disappeared, while square
based octohedrons were produced in their place.
   The iodide is clearly capable of existing in two crystalline forms
belonging   to different systems, and of passing from the one form to
the other, either by diminution of temperature               or by simple
mechanical means.        Such a substance would seem to be likely to
possess  peculiarities  in its modes of expansion under the influence of
heat.   In order to test this the iodide was submitted to the same
experimental treatment as that employed in the case of the iodide of
silver, and previously described in detail.
   Homogeneous rods of the iodide of mercury were heated in paraffine
in the expansion apparatus described and figured in the previous paper,
and the extent of expansion due to a given range of temperature was
noted. The apparatus was standardised by means of a rod of fine
homogeneous silver.       The same micrometer, reading to 5:55th of an
inch, was employed, and the mode of conducting the experiments was
precisely the same as in the case of the iodide of silver.      Two slight
changes were made in the apparatus however:—the one consisted in
the substitution of a massive stone base for the wooden one hitherto
used; and the other the replacement of the glass rods moving in
stuffing boxes, by curved equal-armed levers moving over the rim of
the trough, by which means the leakage of hot paraffine at the stuff
ing boxes was prevented.
   Bars of the iodide of mercury were cast in clean glass tubes, and
here at the outset the experimental difficulties commenced.       For not
only was  it difficult  to obtain   a homogeneous rod, on account of the

volatilisation of the iodide at a temperature slightly exceeding its
melting point, but the rod when cold was found to be so brittle that
it usually broke in the attempt to remove the glass envelope from the
outside.   Eventually good rods were procured by slowly melting the
iodide in thin glass tubes and annealing in hot paraffine. When the
whole was cold the glass was cut on the outside, and carefully broken
off the ends of the rod, which were sawed plane by a fine steel saw.
and then furnished with metal caps, and the rod was placed between
the levers of the expansion apparatus.   After heating the bar once or
twice in   paraffine to a temperature  approaching  its melting point,
longitudinal rifts appeared in the glass envelope, which was then
easily removed, leaving a clean homogeneous rod of the iodide.
  On heating a mass of the crimson amorphous iodide, it turns yellow
at 126°C., and just before the melting point is attained the yellow
changes to a deep red-brown.    The liquid resulting from the fusion
has the appearance of liquid iodide of silver, that is to say, it has the
exact colour of bromine.   The liquid when cooled solidifies to a red
brown solid which speedily becomes yellow, and at 126°C. it changes
to the crimson octohedral variety.    Distinct cracking sounds, due to
inter-molecular movements,  were heard during the continuance of the
change.   Heat is absorbed when the red iodide changes to yellow, and
is given out when the yellow iodide changes to the red.
   A bar of the iodide was placed in the expansion apparatus, melted
paraffine was poured upon     it,
                                and when the index had become quite
steady,a   gentle heat was applied    the paraffine. The index showed

present paper these two tables are compared together.
  It  became obvious      the writers, when engaged
                                 to                       making this                        in
comparison, that the turning points      the curve, which represented

     While this result might have               been rendered evident         by making the
numbers         of   the tables above-mentioned            at    once into curves, yet  was               it
found    to   become more apparent              to the eye       and freer from inequalities
by adopting          a   certain amount     of   equalization.
   Accordingly, the Kew and Trevandrum tables were transformed
into others, with the same time-interval between their numbers                                                 as   in

the two observatories, figs. 1 and 3 giving the Kew curves, and

clusions:—

researches of Broun and others, from a different point of view,

III. “On    the Determination of the Rate of Vibration of Tuning
      Forks.”      By HERBERT McLEOD, F.C.S., and GEORGE
       SYDENHAM CLARKE, Lieut. R.E.         Communicated by Lord
      RAYLEIGH, F.R.S.      Received January 16, 1879.
                               (Abstract.)
   The paper contains a description   of some experiments made with
a view to determine the absolute pitch of tuning forks by means of
a method proposed by the writers in a previous paper (“Proc. Roy.
Soc.,” vol. xxvi, p. 162).
   It commences with a description of the time measurer adopted,
consisting of a compensated pendulum, worked by electricity, the
impulse being given by a driver depending for its action on gravity
alone.   The pendulum is arranged to give second contacts, driving a
clock wheel with sixty teeth. This wheel has a platinum pin giving
minute contacts, but it is used merely as a switch, the circuit being
closed by the pendulum itself.    The current works a relay, and closes
the circuit required.
   The tuning fork apparatus consists of a brass drum resting on
friction wheels, and driven by a weight and train. . Uniformity of
motion being of great importance, an air-regulator, consisting of a fan
enclosed in the lower compartment of a cylindrical box, is employed.
By means of a diaphragm and vanes the fan can be made to do more
or less work by pumping air from the lower into the upper compart
ment.     The fan spindle carries a pulley driven by a thread passing
round the drum.
   Round one end of the drum are wrapped strips of paper on which
white equidistant lines have been so ruled that they are parallel to
the axis of the drum when the strips are in position.    The strip most
frequently used has 486 lines round the complete circumference of the
drum.     Opposite this graduated strip is placed a microscope with its
axis horizontal. In the substage is placed a 2" objective, producing
an image    of the graduations at the focus of the object-glass of the
instrument.    At the common focus of the two lenses is placed the
tuning fork, the stem of which is held vertical in a vice. The fork is
partially enclosed in a glass case, and is so adjusted that the image
of one of its limbs seems to cut the image of the graduations at right
angles. The fork is set in motion by a suspended double-bass bow.
If when the fork is in vibration the drum is made to rotate with such
a velocity that one of the graduations passes over the interval between
two adjacent   graduations in the time of one vibration of the fork, a
stationary wave is seen of length equal to the length of that interval.
 To determine the number of vibrations of the fork in a given time, it

 is only necessary, therefore, to be able to count the number of gradua
  tions which pass in that period.     As a perfectly uniform rotation has
 not been    obtained,  a regulator  under the control of the operator is
 employed.       This consists merely of a piece of string which passes
 round the axis of the drum, and also round a pulley which can be
 turned by the operator's left hand.      An upward or downward motion
 of the wave denotes that the drum is going too fast or too slow, and
 by means of the pulley a gentle check or acceleration sufficient to keep
 the wave steady is given to the drum.
     An electric counter gives the number of complete revolutions accom
 plished by the drum in any given period, and a fine-pointed tube,
containing magenta, is carried by a saddle above the drum, and being
 actuated by an electro-magnet, makes a dot on a piece of white paper
 wrapped round the drum at the beginning and end of the experiment.
 The distance apart of these dots gives the additional fraction of a revo
 lution accomplished by the drum during the period of the experiment.
 Electric circuits are so arranged that a reverser turned a few seconds
before the minute at which it is intended to begin the experiment,
causes a current to be sent exactly at that minute by the clock relay,
which starts the electric counter, and also makes a dot on the drum.
Just before the expiration of the last minute of the experiment, the
reverser is turned in the opposite direction, and at the expiration of
that minute the counter is stopped, and a second mark made on the
drum.
     Some of the results obtained with different forks are given.
     The results of further experiments made to determine the effect of
temperature, of continuous and intermittent bowing, and of the mode
of fixing the fork are appended.
     An optical method by which two slightly dissonant forks may be
compared without altering the period of either, is described.
     Figures and diagrams     fully explaining the apparatus employed,
accompany the paper.
IV. “On      certain means of Measuring and Regulating Electric
        Currents.”    By C. WILLIAM SIEMENS, D.C.L., F.R.S. Re
        ceived  January   16, 1879.
                                 [PLATEs 4, 5.]
    The dynamo-electric machine furnishes us with a means of pro
ducing electric currents of great magnitude, and it has become a
matter     of importance   to measure and regulate the proportionate
amount of current that shall be permitted to flow through any branch
circuit, especially in such applications as the distribution of light and
mechanical force.

1879.]       Measuring and Regulating                      Electric Currents.                    293
   On the 19th of June last, upon the occasion of the Soirée of the
President of the Royal Society, I exhibited a first conception of an
arrangement for regulating such currents, which        have since worked I
out into a practical form.      At the same time,      have been able to I
realize a method     by which currents   passing   through  a circuit, or
branch  circuit, are  measured, and  graphically recorded.
  It  is well known that when an electric current passes through a
conductor,   heat is generated, which, according to Joule, is propor
tionate in amount to the resistance of the conductor, and to the
square of the current which passes through it in a unit of time, or
                                           H=C*R.
  I propose to take advantage of this well-established law of electro
dynamics, in order to limit and determine the amount of current
passing through a circuit, and the apparatus                        I

drawings. Letters of reference to the principal parts of the instru
ment are given on the foot-note of the drawing.
   The most essential part of the instrument is a strip (A) of copper,
iron, or other metal, rolled extremely thin, through which the cur
rent to be regulated has to pass.    One end of this thin strip of metal
is attached to a screw (B),  by which its tension can be regulated; it then
passes upwards over an elevated insulated pulley (I), and down again to
the end of a short lever, working on an axis, armed with a counter
weight and with a lever (L), whose angular position will be mate
rially affected by any small elongation of the strip that may take
place from any cause. The apparatus further consists of a number of
prisms of metal (P), supported by means of metallic springs (M), so
regulated by movable weights (W) as to insure the equidistant posi
tion of each prism from              its
                                 neighbour, unless pressed against the

into circuit: the result being that the temperature of the strip varies
only between very narrow limits, and that the current itself is ren
dered very uniform, notwithstanding considerable variation in its
force, or in the resistance of the lamp, or other extraneous resistance
which it is intended to regulate.
   It might appear at first sight that, in dealing with powerful cur
rents, the breaking of contacts would cause serious inconvenience in
consequence of the discharge of extra current between the points of
contact.   But no such discharges of any importance actually take
place, because the metallic continuity of the circuit is never broken,
and each contact serves only to diminish to some extent the resistance
of the regulating rheostat. The resistance coils, by which adjoining
contact springs are connected, may be readily changed, so as to suit
particular cases; they are made by preference of naked wire, in order
to expose the entire surface to the cooling action of the atmosphere.
   In dealing with feeble currents, I use another form of regulator, in
which disks of carbon are substituted for the wire rheostat. The
Count du Moncel, in 1856, first called attention to, and Mr. Edison more
recently took advantage of, the interesting circumstance that the elec
trical resistance of carbon varies inversely with the pressure to which it
is subjected, and by piling several disks of carbon one upon another in
a vertical glass tube, a rheostat may be constructed which varies between
wide limits, according as the mechanical pressure in the line of the axis
is increased or diminished.  Fig. 4, Plate 5, represents the current regu
lator based upon this principle, and the foot-notes below the figure
furnish the explanation of parts. A steel wire of say 0.3 milim.
diameter is drawn tight between the end of a bell-crank lever (L) and
an adjusting screw (B), the pressure of the lever being resisted by a
pile of carbon disks (C) placed in a vertical glass tube. The current
passing   through the steel wire, through    the bell-crank lever, and
through the carbon disks, encounters the minimum resistance in the
latter so long as the tension of the wire is at its maximum; whereas
the least increase in temperature of the steel wire by the passage of
the current causes a decrease of pressure upon the pile of carbon disks,
and an increase in their electrical resistance; it will thus be readily
seen that, by means of this simple apparatus, the strength of small
currents may be regulated so as to vary only within certain narrow
limits.
   The apparatus described in figs. 1 to 3, Plate 4, may be adapted
also for the measurement of powerful electric currents—an application
which is represented by figs. 5 and 6, Plate 5. The variable rheostat
is in this case dispensed with, and the lever (L) carries at its end a
pencil (P) pressing with   its point upon strip   paper drawn under

adjusted that the lines drawn by the two pencils coincide when no
current is passing through the sensitive strip. The passage of a cur
rent through the strip immediately causes the pencil attached to the
lever to move away from the datum line, and the distance between
the two lines represents the temperature of the strip. This tempera
ture depends, in the first place, upon the amount of current passing
through the strip, and, in the second place, upon the loss of heat by
radiation from the strip; which two quantities balance one another
during any interval that the current remains constant.

that is to say, small variations of current will be proportional to the
variation in the temperature of the strip.
   In order to facilitate the process of determining the value of a
diagram in webers or other units of current, it is only necessary, if
the variations are not excessive,        to average the ordinates, and to
determine     their value by equation (1), or from a table prepared for
that purpose. The error committed in taking the average ordinate
instead of the absolute ordinates, when the current varies between
small limits, is evidently small, the variation of the ordinates above
their mean value averaging the variations below the same.
   The thin sensitive conductor may thus be utilized either to restrict
the amount of electricity flowing through a branch circuit within
certain narrow limits, or to produce a record of the amount of current
passed through a     circuit in any given time.

with hydrogen on both sides of a porous plate, the pressure on the
one side being that of the atmosphere, a difference of 160° F.
(from 52° to 212°) in the temperature on the two sides of the plate
secured a permanent difference in the pressure on the two sides equal
to an inch of mercury; the higher pressure being on the hotter side.
With different   gases and different plates various results were obtained,
which, however, as will be seen, are connected by definite laws.
   3. Again, although Graham found that he obtained not only very
different results, but also very different laws of motion with plates of
different coarseness, or with plates and capillary tubes, neither he nor
any subsequent observer appears to have followed up this lead. As
regards Graham, this appears to me to be somewhat surprising.           For
although he may have considered the mere difference in the results to
have been analogous to the difference found by Poiseuille for liquids,
it would seem as though the difference in the laws of motion should
have excited   his curiosity; and then, as he was avowedly of opinion
that  gas  is molecular,   he could hardly have failed to observe that so
long as the mean distance separating the molecules in the gas bore a
fixed relation to the breadth of the openings in his plates, he should
have had the same laws of motion.          This view, however, appears to
have escaped him as well as all subsequent observers, otherwise it
would have been seen that with a simple gas such as hydrogen, similar
results must be obtained so long as the density of the gas is inversely
proportional to the lateral dimensions of the passages through the
plates.
   By experiments to be described       I have now fully established this
law.    I find that with different plates similar results are obtained
when the densities of the gas with the different plates bear certain
fixed ratios, and that this is the case whatever may be the cause of
transpiration, i.e., a difference of temperature or a difference of pres
sure; a difference of gas     I have not investigated, as it was obviously
unnecessary to do so. Thus, with two plates, one of stucco and the
other of meerschaum, similar results of transpiration caused by pres
sure were obtained when the densities with the two plates were
 respectively as 1 to 5.6 both with hydrogen and air, and at pressures
ranging from 30 to 2 inches of mercury; also with the same two
plates similar results of thermal transpiration were obtained when the
densities were respectively as 1 to 6.5 both for hydrogen and air, and
through a range of densities from 30 inches to 25 of an inch of
mercury, the discrepancy between 5'6 and 6:5 being in all probability
owing to a slightly altered condition of the plates.
   This correspondence of the results at corresponding densities holds
although the law of motion changes. Thus, with air at 30 inches
through the stucco plate, the law of motion was the same as that
 found by Graham for a stucco plate, while at the smallest pressure

 (25 inch) it was nearly the                   same as he found                for graphite plates, or
 for apertures in thin plates.
   Having established this law of corresponding results at correspond
 ing densities, it became apparent that the results obtained with plates
 of different coarseness, and with the same plates, but with different
 densities of gas, followed a definite law. This law, which admits of
 symbolical           expression,
                         shows that there exists a definite relation
 between the results  obtained, the lateral dimensions of the passages,
 and the density of the gas.
   This law is important in reconciling results which have hitherto
 appeared to be discordant and as tending to complete the experimental
 investigation, but it has another and a more general importance.
    It may not appear at first sight, but on consideration it will be seen
 that this law amounts to nothing less than an absolute experimental
 demonstration that gas possesses a heterogeneous structure—that it is
 not a continuous plenum of which each part into which it may be
divided has the same properties as the whole.
   It would appear that Graham must have had this proof, so to speak,
under his eyes, and it is strange that both he and other observers have
overlooked        seems possible, however, that they were not alive

     The Sufficiency of the Demonstration that Gas is not Structureless.
   6.  In  order to prove that gas is not structureless, it is not necessary
that we should be able to perceive the actual structure; we have only
to find some property of a certain quantity of gas which can be shown
not to be possessed by all the parts, some property which is altered
by a rearrangement of the parts.
    Hitherto   I believe that no such property has been recognised, or, at
all  events,  the conclusions to be drawn from such a property have not
been recognised.       The phenomena of transpiration, as well as those of
the radiometer, depend on such properties, but these properties have
not been sufficiently understood to bring out the conclusion.                    This
conclusion, however, follows directly from the law indicated in Article 4,
viz., that the results of transpiration depend on the relation between
the size of the passages and the density of the gas.
                       The Results Deduced from Theory.
    7. Although the existence of the phenomena of thermal transpira
tion, and the existence of the law of corresponding results at corres
ponding densities, have been verified by experiment, they were not so
discovered; they followed from what appeared to be a successful
attempt to complete the explanation which             I had previously offered of
 the forces which result when heat is communicated from a surface to
a gas,” and the phenomena of the radiometer.
                            I
    Having found, what had not at first perceived, that according to
 the kinetic theory the excess of pressure resulting from the communi
cation of heat to a gas must depend on the fact of the surface from
 which the heat flows being of limited extent, and must follow a law
 depending     on some relation between the mean path of a molecule
and the size of the surface, it appeared that by using vanes of
 comparatively small size the force should be perceived at correspond
 ingly greater pressures of gas.
    On considering how this might be experimentally tested, it appeared
 that to obtain any result at measurable pressures the vanes would
 have to be very small indeed; too small almost to admit of experiment.
 And it was while searching for some means to obviate this difficulty
 that I came to perceive that if the vanes were fixed, then instead of
 the movement of the vanes we should have the gas moving past the
 vanes—a sort of inverse phenomenon; and then instead of small vanes
 small spaces might be allowed for the gas to pass. Whence it was at
 once obvious that in the porous plugs              I  should have the means of
 verifying these conclusions.        I  followed   up  the idea, and by a method
  which  I devised of extending the dynamical theory of gases, so as to
 take into account the forces (tangential and normal) arising from a

varying condition of molecular gas,         I was able to deduce what appears
to me to be a complete theory of transpiration.
   This theory appears to include all the results established by Graham,
as well as the known phenomena of the radiometer, which, for the
sake of shortness,   I shall call the phenomena of Impulsion.       I was also
able definitely to deduce the results to be expected as regards both
thermal transpiration and the law of corresponding densities for
transpiration and impulsion.
   Having made these deductions            I  commenced the experiments on
transpiration, which so completely verified my theoretical deductions
that  I have been able to produce the theory in its original form, with
some additions but without any important modification.
   Moreover, having succeeded (not without some trouble) in render
ing apparent the effect of differences of temperature in causing gas to
move through fine apertures,      I   recurred to the original problem, and
by suspending fibres of silk and spider lines to act as vanes,          I have
now succeeded in directly verifying the conclusion that the pressure
of gas at which the force in the radiometer becomes apparent varies
inversely as the size of the vanes. With the fibre of silk obtained I
repulsion at pressures of half an atmosphere.
                        The Arrangement of the Paper.
   8. My object in this paper is to describe the reasoning by which I
was led to undertake the experiments, as well as the experiments
themselves; but as the theory will be better understood after an
acquaintance with the facts,        I  have inverted the natural order and
given the experiments first.       I  include here, however, a somewhat full
account   of the results to be expected as deduced from the theory.
   Then follows a statement of the laws of transpiration and impulsion
as deduced from     theory:
   Section   II  is devoted to the description of the experiments on
 thermal transpiration; Section       III  to the experiments on transpiration
 under pressure, and Section IV to the experiments on impulsion.
    In this abstract it will not be possible to give more than a sketch
 of the matter contained in these sections. The numerous precautions
 and tests will have to be left unnoticed, and only a few of the experi
 mental results can be given.             The investigation occupied from
 February,    1878,  till the beginning        of August, every result    being
 verified by repeated experiments.
                  The Apparatus for Thermal Transpiration.
    This consisted principally of an instrument called a thermo-diffusio
 meter, of which the essential feature is two chambers, separated by a
 plate of porous material, means being provided for keeping the
 chambers at constant, but different, temperatures for many hours at a

time, also for measuring the pressure of gas in the chambers, for
exhausting the chambers, and for bringing the chambers into direct
communication        when required.    The different temperatures were
secured   by  a stream of steam on the one side, which gave a tempera
ture of 212° F., and a stream of water on the other side, which gave a
temperature constant for the time, but which ranged during the
investigation from 47° in February to 70° in July.
   The porous plates tried were of biscuit-ware, stucco, and meerschaum,
and ranged in thickness from 06 (1.5 millims.) to 44 inch (11.2
millims). The pressures of gas within the chambers and the difference
of pressure on the two sides of the plate were measured by mercury
gauges.     A  special instrument used for reading the differential gauge
read to the Tübooth of an inch ('0025 millim.).
    Several weeks were spent on this apparatus in getting it tight,
getting the gauges to work, and getting rid of the disturbing effects
of moisture, before any definite results were obtained, but finally the
instrument answered extremely well.
                  The Experiments on Thermal Transpiration.
    The streams of steam and water having been kept going for several
hours, long enough for the condition of temperature in the instrument to
be perfectly steady, the tap which established communication between
the chambers on the opposite sides of the porous plate having been open,
so that the pressure in these chambers was equal, this tap was closed,
so that the sole communication      was through the porous plate. Any
 difference of pressure between these chambers was then read on the
 differential gauge.
    Supposing that on the first reading the gas (whatever it might be)
 within the instrument was at the pressure of the atmosphere, a certain
 quantity of gas was then drawn out and the experiment repeated.
 This was done until the pressure within the instrument was as low
as 25 inch of mercury.
    According to the theoretical   deductions, it had appeared that when
 the sole communication      between the two chambers was through the
 porous plate, and the gas in these chambers was at the same pressure,
 the difference of temperature would cause the gas to pass from the
 colder chamber to that which was hotter, until a certain difference of
 pressure was established, after which there would be no further change
as long as the same difference of temperature was maintained, so that
 the result to be expected as giving evidence of thermal transpiration
was a difference in the pressure on the two sides of the plate.
    This difference was first obtained with air at the pressure of the
atmosphere      and a biscuit-ware   plate, the difference  being   1 inch
 (2.54 millims).

cateris paribus, depend on the difference of temperature, would also
depend on the relation between the density of the gas and the coarse
ness of the plate, so that, caeteris paribus, the finer the plate the greater
the difference, and this conclusion was at once verified.
   A  plate of meerschaum, 25 inch (6.3 millims.) thick, gave a differ
ence, 25 inch with air, and ’88 with hydrogen, at the pressure
of the atmosphere, while a plate of stucco of the same thickness as
the meerschaum only gave a difference of '02 inch with air and 14
inch with hydrogen.
   It also appeared from the theory that with the same plate and the
same gas, the difference of pressure should be a maximum at some
particular density, so that if the initial density was sufficient, the
thermal difference of pressure would increase as exhaustion proceeded
up to a certain point and then fall off, the density at which the
thermal difference would be a maximum depending on the coarseness
of the plate and the nature of the gas. These conclusions were
verified.

                    Mean Pressure in inches of Mercury.
    For with the meerschaum piate the thermal difference for air was
 almost constant at pressures nearly equal to the atmosphere, but fell at
 an increasing rate as the density diminished (this is shown by the curve

1879.]          Properties   of Matter in   the Gaseous State.        311
for air, fig. 1).  From this it was clear that if the thermal difference
reached a maximum it would be at some pressure greater than that of
the atmosphere,      With stucco the thermal difference for air increased
as the    pressure  fell from that of the atmosphere, and reached a
maximum only at a pressure of about 8 inches of mercury (shown in
fig. 2).

    A comparison of these results shows that the density at which the
thermal transpiration is a maximum depends on the coarseness of the
plate; and that it depends on the nature of the gas appears at once on
comparing the results for hydrogen, air, and carbonic acid, which are
shown on figs. 1 and 2.
    Experiments with plates of various thicknesses gave the thermal
difference of pressures independent of the thickness of the plate, so
long as the difference of temperature was the same.
    Several minor deductions from the theory were also directly verified.
        The Law of Corresponding Results at Corresponding Densities.
    In order to establish this law it was necessary to compare the results
obtained with different plates. According to the law, the ratio of the
thermal difference of pressure to the mean pressure with a particular
 plate and a particular gas should be the same as with another plate and
 the same gas, as long as the densities (or pressures) are in a fixed
 ratio, which is the ratio of the fineness of the plates.
   A  simple numerical calculation sufficed to show that this conclusion
is approximately verified.      On dividing the thermal differences by the
 mean pressure for both the meerschaum and stucco plates, it appears
that the resulting numbers are approximately equal, so long as the
pressure with the meerschaum is six times as great as with the stucco.
This is so both for air and hydrogen, and through a range of pressures
 from 30 to 35 inches with the meerschaum, and 5 to 2 inches with
the stucco.
    The numerical comparison      does not, however, bring out the agree
ment in nearly as strong a light as the comparison which has been
effected by a graphic method.

                                   Graphic Method of comparing the Results.
             This method consists in taking                         as ordinates and abscissae, not the
         thermal differences and mean pressures, but the logarithms of these
         quantities, and the curves so formed are called the logarithmic homo
         logues of the curves shown in figs. 1 and 2.
            Any common ratio which exists between ordinates or abscissae of
         corresponding points on the natural curves becomes a common differ
         ence between the ordinates or abscissae of                         their logarithmic        homologues,
         so that  if the natural curves correspond after the manner that has just
         been  described,  their logarithmic homologues must be precisely similar
         curves, such that by shifting the one parallel to itself it can be made to
         fit on to the other.

   These results, in as far as the conditions correspond, were found to
agree very closely with the results obtained by Graham.                Thus,
through stucco at 30 inches, the comparative times of transpiration of
air and hydrogen were as 2.9 to 1, Graham's results being 2-8 to 1.
Through meerschaum the ratio was 3.6 to 1, Graham having found the
ratio 3.8 to 1 through a graphite plate, which was in all probability
finer than the meerschaum. The ratio of the times of transpiration of
equal volumes of different gases, which Graham looked upon as vary
ing only with the coarseness of the plates, was found, as was expected,
to depend entirely on the relation between the pressures of the gases
and the coarseness of the plates, the ratio of the times being the same
as long as the pressures of the gases were inversely proportional to
the coarseness of the plates.
   Thus, at a pressure of 5 inches, the times for hydrogen and air
through stucco, instead of being 29, as at the pressure of the atmos
phere, were 3.6, or the same as through meerschaum at a pressure six
times as great; the coarseness of the plates, as determined in the
previous experiments, being 5.6. The same agreement held as long as
the ratio between the pressures was maintained.
   The correspondence of the results for different plates, and the com
plete verification of the theoretical conclusions which they afforded, is
shown by comparing the logarithmic homologues of the curves in
which the times of transpiration are the ordinates and the pressures the
abscissae.   The fitting of the logarithmic homologues is exact, both      as
regards    the direction   of the curves and the distances between the
curves, for air and hydrogen; the displacement along the        abscissae, to
bring the curves into coincidence, being 819 = log. 6.5.
   As this number, 6.5, is the ratio of the coarseness of the plates, it
should have corresponded with the ratio obtained by thermal transpira
tion, which was 5.6, with the same plates. This discrepancy, although
too small to cast a doubt upon the general agreement of the results, is
too large to be attributed to experimental inaccuracy, and must have
been due to some change in the plates, probably arising from the
plates being hot in the one case and cold in the other.
             Experiments on Impulsion with a Suspended     Fibre.
   A   single fibre of unspun silk was suspended from one end in a
 vertical test-tube, closed with an india-rubber cork, and connected with
an air-pump, and a microscope was arranged for observing the motion
of the fibre when a hot body was brought into      a certain  position   near
 the test-tube.
   With air in the test-tube at the pressure of the atmosphere, it        was
found that the fibre was carried by the air-currents towards the hot
body, and this was the case as long as the pressure was greater than
 8 inches of mercury, but after the tube had been exhausted below

 1879.]        Properties of Matter in    the Gaseous State.             315
this point, the fibre moved away from the heat, and the motion
steadily increased as the pressure became very small, such as #5th
of an inch of mercury.
   With hydrogen in the test-tube, the fibre moved away from the heat
at all pressures below that of the atmosphere, and for small pressures
the motion was somewhat larger than with air.
   A spider-line was also tried, and gave results similar to the fibre of
silk.
   It thus appeared that both with the fibre of silk and the spider-line
the phenomena of impulsion were manifest at densities many hundred
times greater than the highest densities at which like results are
obtained with the vanes of the radiometer which are several hundred
times broader than the fibre of silk. And this verifies the law of
corresponding results at corresponding       densities for this class of phe
11ornella.
              Abstract of Part  II (Theoretical  Investigation).
   The characteristic as well as the novelty of this investigation is
that, not only is the mean of the motions of the molecules at the
point under consideration taken into account, but also the manner in
which the mean motion may vary from point to point, in any direction
across the point under consideration.     It appears that such a variation
gives rise to certain stresses in the gas (tangential and normal) and it
is of these stresses that the phenomena of transpiration      and impulsion
afford evidence.
   Instead of considering only the mean condition of the molecules
comprised within an elementary volume of the gas, what is chiefly
considered in this investigation is the mean condition of the molecules
which cross an elementary area in a plane supposed to be drawn
through the point.
   Q is used to indicate a quantity belonging to a molecule such as its
mass, momentum, or energy, a.(Q) to express the rate at which Q is
carried across a plane perpendicular to the direction c.
   Two systems of axes are employed, alyz fixed axes, with respect
to which u, v, w, are the component velocities of a molecule, and a
system of axes parallel to wyz, but moving with the component
velocities U, V, W, with respect to which 5, 7, g, have the com

   As preliminary to the investigation, expressions are obtained for
a(Q) in terms of a, U, V, and W, on the supposition that the gas is
uniform.    This is accomplished by the application of well-known
methods.

   When the condition        of the gas varies from point to point, the
molecules are considered as consisting of two groups, one crossing
from the positive and the other from the negative side of the plane.
Considered      in opposite directions, the mean characteristics         (the
number, mass, momentum, or energy) of these two groups are not
necessarily equal. They may differ in consequence of the motion of
the gas, the motion of the plane through the gas, or a varying con
dition of the gas, and the determination of the effect of these causes,
particularly the last, on the mass, momentum and energy that may be
carried across by either or both groups constitutes the extension of
the dynamical theory of gases.
   In order to take account of the difference in the two groups it is
assumed, and so far there is nothing new in the assumption itself,
that the group of molecules which crosses the surface from either side
will partake of the characteristics of the gas in the region from which
the molecules which constitute the group have come. The first direct
step in the investigation is the deduction from the foregoing assump
tion of two theorems (I and II), supposing that there are no external
forces. Taking o'(Q) to be the approximate value of a(Q) obtained
on the assumption that the gas is uniformly in the mean condition
which holds at the point xyz, the theorems            I and II  admit of the
following symbolical expression:—
              -(Q)=-Q-4:...           (9): (Q)+...(Q)}.
   Where    s  represents a certain distance,    measured from the plane of
reference.
   This distance, s, enters as a quantity of primary importance into
all the results of the investigation.
   It is proposed to calls the mean range of the quantity Q, so as to
distinguish it from the mean path of a molecule.
   s is a function of the    mean path,  but   it also depends on the nature
of the impacts between the molecules. It        is subsequently shown that—

   The dynamical conditions of steady density, steady momentum, and
steady energy are then considered.
   Putting >(Q) for the value of Q in a unit of volume, in order that
>(Q) may be steady, we have—

the condition of steady density, for steady momentum Q has severally
the values Mu, Mv, Mw, and for steady energy Q=M(u” + v + w”).
  The equations of motion are then applied to the particular cases
which it is the object of this investigation to explain. Two cases are
considered.
  The first case is that of a gas in which the temperature and pressure
vary only along a particular direction, so that the isothermal surfaces
and the surfaces of equal pressure are parallel planes; this is the case
of transpiration.
   The second case is that in which the isothermal                                  surfaces       and
surfaces         of equal pressure are curved (whether of single or double
curvature); this is the             case   of impulsion and the radiometer.
                                           Transpiration.
  As regards the first case, the condition of steady energy proved to
be of no importance, but from the conditions of steady momentum and
steady density, an equation is obtained between the velocity of the
gas, the rate at which the temperature varies, and the rate at which
the pressure varies, the coefficients being functions of the absolute
temperature                               of the apertures, and the
                     of the gas, the diameters
ratio of these diameters to the mean range, which coefficients are
known for the limiting conditions of the gas, i.e., when the density is
either very small or very large.

  In dealing with the second     case, that in which the isothermal
surfaces are curved, the three conditions-steady density, momentum,
and energy—are all of them important.
  These conditions reduce to an equation between the motions of the
gas the variation in the absolute temperature and the variation in the
pressure, with coefficients which involve the ratio of the mean range
to the dimensions of the radii of curvature of the surfaces.      The
equation corresponds to the equation of transpiration, and as applied
to the case in which heat is being conducted through a gas which is
constrained to remain at rest, the equation becomes—

   (1.) The primary step from which all the rest may be said to follow
is the method of obtaining the equations of motion so as to take into
account not only the normal stresses which result from the mean
motion     of the molecules at a point, but also the normal and tangential
stresses    which result from a variation in the condition of the gas
(assumed to be molecular).    This method is given in Sections VI,
VII,  and VIII.
   (2.) The method of adapting these equations to the case of tran
spiration through tubes and porous plates is given in Section IX. The
equations of steady motion are reduced to a general equation expressing
the relation between the rate of transpiration, the variation of pressure,
the variation of temperature, the condition of the gas, and the lateral
dimensions of the tube.
  In Section X is shown the manner in which were revealed the pro
bable existence (1) of the phenomena of thermal transposition, and (2)
the law of correspondence between all the results of transpiration with
different plates, so long as the density of the gas is inversely propor
tional to the linear lateral dimensions of the passages through the
plates; from which revelations originated the idea of making the ex
periment on thermal transpiration and transpiration under pressure.
   (3.) It is also shown in Section X that the phenomena of transpi
ration resulting from a variation in the molecular constitution of the
gas (investigated by Graham) are also to be deduced from the equation
of transpiration.
                                                                -
   (4.) The method of adapting the equations of motion to the case of
impulsion  is given in Section XI.
   In Section XII is shown how it first became apparent that the ex
tremely low pressures at which alone the phenomena of the radiometer
had been obtained were consequent on the comparatively large size of
the vanes, and that by diminishing the size of the vanes similar results
might be obtained at higher pressures, whence followed the idea of
using the fibre of silk and the spider-line in place of the plate vanes.
   (5.) In Section    XIIit is also shown that while the phenomena of
the radiometer result from the communication of heat from a surface
to a gas, as explained in my former paper, these phenomena also
depend on the divergence of the lines of flow, whence it is shown that
allthe peculiar facts that have been observed may    explained.

   (6.) Section   II,  Part I, contains a description of the experiments
undertaken to verify the revelations of Section X respecting thermal
transpiration, which experiments establish not only the existence of
the phenomena, but also an exact correspondence between the results
for the different plates at corresponding densities of the gas.
    (7.) Section  III  contains a description of the experiments on trans
piration under pressure undertaken to verify the revelations of Sec
tion   X with  respect to the correspondence between the results to be
obtained with plates of different coarseness at certain corresponding
densities of gas, which experiments proved not only the existence of
this correspondence, but also that the ratio of the corresponding
densities in these experiments is the same as the ratio of the corre
sponding densities with the same plates in the case of thermal trans
piration—a fact which proves that the ratio depends entirely on the
plates.
    (8.) Section IV contains a description of the experiments with the
fibre of silk, and with the spider-line undertaken to verify the reve
lations of Section XII, from which experiments it appears that,
with these small surfaces, phenomena of impulsion, similar to those of
the radiometer, occur at pressure but little less than that of the
atmosphere.
                                  Conclusion,
    Article 126. As regards transpiration and impulsion, the investiga
 tion appears to be complete; most, if not all, the phenomena pre
 viously known have been shown to be such as must result from the
 tangential and normal stresses consequent on a varying condition of a
 molecularly constituted gas; while the previously unsuspected phe
 nomena to which it was found that a variation in the condition of gas
 must give rise, have been found to exist.              -
    The results of the   investigation  lead to certain general conclusions
 which lie outside the immediate object for which it was undertaken;
 the most important of these, namely, that gas is not a continuous
 plenum, has' already been noticed in Article 5, Part I.
                      The Dimensional Properties of Gas.
     Article 127. The experimental results considered by themselves
 bring to light the dependence of a class of phenomena on the relations
 between the density of the gas and the dimensions of the objects
 owing to the presence of which the phenomena oceur. As long as
 the density of the gas is inversely proportional to the coarseness of the
 plates the transpiration results correspond; and in the same way,
 although not so fully investigated, corresponding phenomena of im
 pulsion are obtained as long as the density of the gas in inversely
  proportional to the linear size of the objects exposed to its action;

   In   the course of an investigation           into the development of the
 cranial nerves of the chick, certain facts came to light indicating that
 the olfactory nerve, instead of being, as usually described, a structure
 differing totally in its mode of origin from all the other nerves in the
body, in reality “exactly corresponds in mode of development and
in appearance with the other cranial nerves, and with the posterior
 roots of the spinal nerves.”
   The present paper contains the results of further investigations on
 this point; it deals also with some features in the development of the
vertebrate olfactory organ, and with certain questions of a more
 general nature affected by the conclusions arrived at.

                         The Development of the Olfactory Nerve.
  For the sake of clearness the more important conclusions are stated
in the form of propositions:—
    a. The olfactory nerves do not arise from the cerebral hemispheres, but
from the single unpaired forebrain.
    In chick embryos of about the fiftieth hour, or a little older, the
 olfactory nerves can be clearly recognized arising from the upper
 part of the sides of the forebrain.      At this stage there is no trace
 whatever of the cerebral hemispheres.        The olfactory nerves then
 come into existence before the cerebral hemispheres, and therefore
 cannot be derived from them. The hemispheres are developed in the
 chick as lateral outgrowths from the upper part of the forebrain; at
 first the olfactory nerves have no connexion with them, beyond that of
 close proximity; but very soon the hemispheres, by their rapid growth
 forwards, drive the nerves down to the base of the brain, and so make
the nerves appear to arise from their under and anterior part.
  This account is confirmed in all points by observations on duck
embryos, which show clearly that the connexion of the olfactory
nerves with the cerebral hemispheres is not of a primary but of a
secondary or adaptative nature.                       -

from    a histological      point of view differs in no appreciable respect
from the other cranial nerves at corresponding stages of their develop
ment. At the end of the sixth day of incubation the nerve, which is
now of some length, has acquired its secondary connexion with the
cerebral hemisphere in the manner described above; yet the nerve is
still solid along its whole length, and presents no trace whatever of
an olfactory lobe, or hollow outgrowth from the brain.                    By the end
of the seventh     day   a  very  small conical    pit  is visible in the wall of the
cerebral hemisphere at the point of origin of the olfactory nerve.
This pit, which is the earliest rudiment of the olfactory lobe, is formed
almost entirely at the expense of the inner wall of the hemisphere, so
that there is hardly any corresponding projection on the outside of
the brain.
    The development of the olfactory lobe in the dogfish closely
resembles that in the chick: at stage M there is no trace whatever of
a lobe, though      the olfactory nerves are large and conspicuous struc
tures. At a      stage  a little younger than Balfour's stage O, the first
rudiment of an olfactory lobe appears, as a slight lateral bulging of
the side of the forebrain, at the point of origin of the olfactory nerve:
this increases rapidly, much more so indeed than the nerve itself; by
stage O it is a tolerably prominent structure, and in the later stages
it becomes    considerably larger than the nerve proper.”
    Stage O in the development of a dogfish embryo corresponds to
about the sixth day in the chick, so that there is a close agreement in
time as well as in mode of development of the olfactory lobe in these
two types. In the dogfish, however, the olfactory lobes appear before
the cerebral hemispheres are differentiated, and consequently arise
from the forebrain; while in the chick the hemispheres are developed
rather earlier, and the olfactory lobes arise as direct outgrowths from
them, and not from the original forebrain.
   In the salmon and trout, from the earliest period at which the
existence of an olfactory nerve can be recognized up to the time of
hatching, and indeed for some little time afterwards, there is no trace
of an olfactory lobe.
    The existence of an olfactory nerve without any trace of an olfactory
lobe has also been established in the earlier embryonic stages of the
axolotl, of the common frog, and of the green lizard.
    The olfactory nerve of an adult vertebrate is commonly described
as consisting of three parts, a proximal element or olfactory tract, an
intermediate olfactory bulb, and a distal olfactory nerve proper, the two
former of these corresponding to the olfactory lobe or vesicle of the
embryo.      From the descriptions given above it would appear that the
   * Cf. Balfour, op. cit., p. 178, and Plate 15, figs. 2 and 8a. Balfour has not ob.
served the olfactory nerves earlier than stage O, and therefore describes them as
outgrowths from the olfactory lobes.

third of these elements—the olfactory nerve proper—is the earliest
to be developed, and that the olfactory tract and bulb, when present
at all, do not appear till an exceedingly late period of development—
a period so late indeed that their ultimate presence affords no ground
whatever for separating the olfactory from the other cranial nerves.
   c. The olfactory nerve is a primary nerve, comparable to the segmental
cranial nerves.
   Certain of the cranial nerves, e.g., the facial and glossopharyngeal,
have long been recognized as possessing segmental value. These seg
mental nerves in the early stages of their development possess certain
characters in common, which serve to distinguish them sharply from
other nerves or branches of nerves; of these characters the following
are the most important:—(1) They appear very early; (2) they arise
(at least in the chick) from the neural ridge on the mid-dorsal surface
of the brain; (3) shortly after their appearance their roots undergo a
shifting downward of their points of attachment, so that they no longer
arise from the dorsal surface, but from the sides of the brain; (4) they
present, at least in their early stages, ganglionie enlargements on, or
close to, their roots of origin; (5) their course is at right angles to the
longitudinal axis of the head; (6) and, finally, they have very definite
relations to the segments as indicated by the visceral clefts, each nerve
supplying the two sides of a cleft.
   In     all
          these points the olfactory nerve agrees very closely with the
                                                                                 in

points only being noticed which are of special interest in connexion
with the conclusions arrived at in the preceding part of the paper.
   The olfactory pits appear at almost the same time as the visceral
clefts; or, to speak more accurately, they first become conspicuous
objects at, or very shortly after, the time when the anterior visceral
clefts become open to the exterior.    This occurs about stage K in the
dogfish, and about the fiftieth hour in the chick.
   In their early stages the olfactory pits present a striking resem
blance to the visceral clefts in position, shape, size, and general rela
tions; their external apertures elongate and become slit-like, and the
direction of the slit, like that of the visceral clefts, is at right angles
to the longitudinal axis of the head. These facts are best illustrated
by the study of whole embryos, and of longitudinal vertical sections."
They come out with great clearness in all the types of vertebrates
examined, but with especial distinctness in the axolotl and salmon.
   The development of the Schneiderian folds presents several points
of great interest, which can be most favourably studied in the Elasmo
branchs. Attention has already been directed by Balfourt to the very
early appearance of these folds.     The important point, so far as the
present question is concerned, is that these Schneiderian folds appear at
the same time as, or very shortly after, the first rudiments of the gills.
In addition to this identity in time, there is also identity in structure;
in both cases development consists in the formation of a series of equal,
closely apposed folds, mainly epithelial, but involving the underlying
mesoblast to a certain extent. These folds are in the two cases—gills
and Schneiderian folds—of the same width, the same distance apart,
have epithelium of the same thickness and same histological character,
involve the mesoblast to exactly the same extent, and in exactly the
same manner; in a word, are structurally identical.
   In the later stages the Schneiderian folds, like the gills, receive a
very abundant supply of blood-vessels; and the relations of these
vessels to the folds, which are very peculiar and characteristic, are
identical in the two cases.  Even in the adult Elasmobranch there is a
remarkable histological resemblance between the gills and the nose.
  The facts       above recorded concerning the development             of the olfactory
nerve and olfactory organ point towards the same conclusions as to
morphology of these structures, viz., that the olfactory organ is the
visceral cleft; that the olfactory nerve is the segmental nerve supply
ing that cleft in a manner precisely similar to that in which the hinder

330          Mr. W. K. Parker on         the Development   of the        [Feb. 13,
Sir Wyville Thomson and Mr. H. N. Moseley; the latter (who                     made
the collection in the Island of Ascension), sending me the smaller
specimens, and the former the ripe, and nearly ripe young.
  Through the liberality and kindness of these gentlemen, am put in I
possession of an invaluable series of specimens, several dozens in number;
the smallest being only half an inch long measured along its curve.
   Sir Wyville Thomson, having accepted my offer of the memoir                    I
am preparing on this type of reptile for the “Challenger” Series of
papers,  I am anxious to lay before the Royal Society some at least of
                       I
the results which have obtained; so that there may be a connexion
kept up between my papers, and this slow ingathering of results be
garnered in known places, for the benefit of those who will sift and
use them.
  I  have for many years been familiar with the existence of both
paired and unpaired elements in the spine and hinder part of the
skull: and also with the three cartilages that build up the fore part of
the chondro-cranium.
   My attention, however, having been directed most to the symme
trical pro-chordal bands,—the middle and fore part of the trabeculae
cranii,-the anterior azygous cartilage, although always before my
eyes, has never, until lately, received the attention it deserves.
   In my first paper (on the skull of the ostrich tribe) held views I
                                           I
with regard to the trabeculae which hold now; but there has been
an intermediate period in which      Ihave fallen into, what        I
                                                                must now
consider to be a serious error.
   This error lay in the placing, both by Professor Huxley and myself,
of the  trabeculae cranii in the category of visceral arches.
   Both of us have known for many years that the hinder part of the
trabeculae of the newt are para-chordal, and I more recently discovered
that the hinder part of the basi-cranial plate is developed separately
in the Amphibia.
   Professor Huxley restricts the term “para-chordal” to these hinder
         I
plates; am satisfied that the term must have a wider application.
   Nevertheless, what the Selachians, and      types above the Ichthy
                                                    all
opsida show, satisfies me that Rathke was right          considering the
                                                           in
trabeculae   to   be
                 mere continuations       of
                                         the moieties     the basal plate
                                                           of
or “investing mass.”
I    quite agree with Mr. Balfour    inlooking upon the whole       these of
tracts, right and left,    tothe undivided representatives
                                be                             the paired

                  of                              rule, they are distinct

from each other, and are developed between the spinal            nerves, being
inter-segmental.
I    am satisfied that dying out     of
                                     the notochord      front does not

                           of           tracts.

tion to the forward growth of that rod.
  I  now, see, however, that this azygous structure, the true skeletal
axis, which is early separated from the hypoblast, begins to starve at
its fore end, before the pituitary body formed.                   is
   The main    part    the hypoblast,

grow.
   At first,    Mr. Balfour shows, this rod

  For this latter region has, in common with the spine, the notochord,
its mesoblastic sheath, paired neural and haemal elements,                             besides   a
hypoblastic lining to the digestive tube beneath.
  Moreover, there is a great tendency to produce vertebrae in the hind
part of the head in some Vertebrata; in several of the Urodelous Am
phibia there are three rudimentary vertebrae in front of the “atlas.”
  Thus the scant growth of the hypoblast in the cephalic region of
the blastoderm, would appear to be one of the causes of the extreme
modification of the head as compared with the spinal column.*
  We shall have made a great stroke in embryology when we have
explained the peculiar behaviour of the epiblastic covering of the fore
part of the head.
   There, the oral involution, which is formed from epiblast, turns
inwards and upwards into the fore-part of the hollow under the mid
brain, and grafts itself upon the back of the down-turned fore-brain,
itself of epiblastic origin; thus the pituitary body is formed.
   In all available interspaces the mesoblast of the fore half of the
head grows in and forms the supporting structures, and the vascular
                                                        -
supply.
  But now there arises this question—are the mesoblastic structures
of the cranium in the pro-chordal region perfectly homologous with
those in the para-chordal, whether cephalic or spinal?
                                                       I
   In endeavouring to answer this question, must return to the point
at which        I
            started, where it was mentioned that there existed an un
paired pro-chordal cartilage between the symmetrical trabeculae.
  This, in the fore-part of the chondro-cranium, is a familiar part—
pre-nasal rostrum    (“Ostrich's Skull,” Plate 7, p, n); its largest
development is in the skate, saw-fish, and whale.
  But the perpendicular ethmoid and septum nasi are, in reality, other
parts of the same azygous cartilage (see “Frog's Skull,” Plate 6,
figs. 9, 10); in the Batrachia          I
                               have studied the development of this
median part in a large number, both of individuals and species.
  But      its
           real character   best seen
                                  is     my second and third stages
                                                 in                                              of
the  embryos          of
                  Chelone midas;  these measured along their curves are
respectively two-thirds           of   an
                                 inch and one inch and       quarter              a              in
length.
   In the younger            of
                      these the trabeculae are like those    the frog                 of
and Selachian, but they stop short and end       somewhat out-turned
                                                        in  a
“cornu" behind the nasal    sacs; they  are flat   front and rounded

face, and the “infundibulum       buds out    ”   uneet the oral involutionto
 on the posterior (= inferior) surface      the fore-brain.    of
   We thus see that the true organic punctum terminale must lie
between these two parts, the olfactory nerve and infundibulum, and
therefore    looks downwards, and

                     Mr. W. K. Parker            on the Development                       of   the       [Feb.
 If  the head had been straight, this drop         cartilage would have      of
reached its fore-end directly below the first nerves.
I   shall return      this part
                            to     the subject  of the latter half   my      in                               of
paper.
   The visceral or inferior arches of the head are as diverse from the
costal arches          as   the axial parts           of      the head are from                      those    of   the
body.
   That splitting    the mesoblast, which forms the “body-cavity,” runs
                            of
high up into the muscle-plates; but this upper part          the cavity                          of
closes again, whilst, below, the ventral wall  permanently divided into is
“splanchnopleure” and “somatopleure.”
I    have corroborated Mr. Balfour's account of the extension of this
cavity into the head    the embryo
                                 of   the Selachians     demonstrating
                                                          of                                by
it   in
      the head    the embryo lizard and turtle.
                       of
  To me this “head cavity” appears              the equivalent     to
                                                                    the  be                                  of
temporary upper part       the body cavity; this cephalic extension
                                      of                                                                            of
the cavity    also temporary.
                 is
     The cells lining these cavities                 in   the head become transformed into
muscular fibres.
     Thus, there       is   a    reversion      of   the ventral
                                                       the head into         wall      of                            a
generalised condition before the visceral rods are developed.
     In
      the trunk the axial skeleton”      formed inside the upper diver
                                                              is
ticulum     the body
               of     cavity, and therefore    the splanchnic layer;    in                                          of
course the costal arches pass over the permanent body cavity into the
somatic layer.
  Mr. Balfour's view with regard                      to      the visceral arches and branchial
pouches        is,that they are all formed            in      a  tract equivalent    the somatic to
                                                          -
layer     of   the body.
     Yet the difference between the costal and visceral arches                                               is   very
great; and the fact that there are two                   sets     them, external and
                                                                                  of
internal, separated by            a   large branchial space, does not lessen the diffi
culty     of    harmonising           these two sets               of   arches, the costal and the
visceral.
   We may, however, keep the term pleural for both, and divide this
“genus into two “species”—visceral and costal—and the visceral
            ”
into two varieties, namely, external and internal.
I     suspect that there has been      secular differentiation
                                                          a         these                                of

                                           in
round the huge branchial pharynx; then the trabeculae           support                          as  a              to
the  swelling  neural axis; then the  paired  neural   cartilages      the                                   of
spine; after these, the intra-branchials; then the costal arches;                                                 and,
last   all, the limb-girdles and limbs.

the order of time in the appearance of these parts in the quasi-ancient
stages of the early embryos of existing, but low, vertebrate types.
   The ventral wall of the head undergoes dehiscence in three places,
on each side, in front of the tympano-eustachian, or so-called first
cleft.
   The right and left clefts directly in front of that open freely into
each other below; they form the angles of the opening mouth.
   Another cleft, the lacrymal, is formed in the region over which the
third nerve forks; this nerve, the motor oculi, is a true segmental
nerve, but is specially devoted to the eyeball.
   The eyeball forms for itself a nest above and in front of the mouth,
and this cupped orbital space is permanently open antero-inferiorly.
   In the turtle, at my second stage, the maxillo-palatine fold is very
large, is dilated at both ends, and pinched in the middle; in the hind
part there is for a time, as        I
                                have showed in the lizard, an extension
of the pleuro-peritoneal cavity.
   This is the only one of the head cavities which opens into its fellow
of the opposite side; the presence of this cavity is as sure a sign of
segmentation as the forking of a segmental nerve over the space in
front of and above it.
   The thick front part of the visceral fold between the lacrymal and
nasal clefts does not acquire a cavity.
   The whole of this double fold over and in front of the mouth cleft is
largely aborted in the Selachians by a foregrowth of the mandibular
fold; but in some sharks, as in Notidanus, and in all rays, a true
palatine cartilage is developed in that part of the face which is be
tween the lacrymal and nasal clefts.”
   Between the lacrymal and oral clefts, and therefore between the
hinder fork of the third nerve and the true anterior fork of the fifth
nerve, a visceral cartilage appears in several types.
   In Scymnus, among the sharks, in Menopoma and Siredon, among
the Urodeles, in nearly all lizards, and in the Chelonians, a separate
cartilage appears in the hinder lobe of the maxillo-palatine fold, after
the disappearance of the head cavity.
  In the lamprey, and the larvae of the Batrachia, the extreme forward

Bufo, after metamorphosis, and          all the rest  ofthe Batrachians
                                                                          as    very definite

region    of
           the sub-ocular arch.        the salmon, among the Teleostei, this cartilage     is
separately developed      first, and this
                          at                  evidently the rule
                                                is               in  the Order.
   In  the Siluroids (Doras, Clarias) this becomes         astraight rod  of  bone, carrying
the tentacle-bearing, minute maxillary,         front, and lying over the pterygoid, and
                                                 in
mesopterygoid behind; with these          never unites.
  In  lizards, and many birds, there    is it
                                            avery definite palatine cartilage which appears
between the    lacrymal and nasal  clefts;      remains cartilaginous
                                                 it                     in  the former, but
in  many birds (Musophaga, Dicholophus, Diomedea, &c.) acquires its own bony
centre.

            extension of the dorsal part of the mandibular arch suppresses
            pre-oral cartilages; in the Selachians—sharks especially—this is
            by the pterygoid outgrowth of the same element.
              In the first case, the whole mouth is dominated by the suctorial
            tilages; in the second, the immense development of the ptery
            process of the manibular pier, antagonising the movable lower
            causes the great suppression of the proper maxillo-palatine fold.

  In this lattercase, the splitting of the mesoblasts into several strata
in the throat, on the one hand, and in the thoracic and pelvic regions
of the  body,  on the other, are strictly comparable morphological
changes.

                                       that   if
the lancelet and the lamprey, we should find in these “connecting
links” that the head was not a mere repetition of the body.
   Somatomes we should find; but the intercalary skeletal parts would
be found,       I
            believe, to run into each other from the first, and the hasi

distinct neural arches of the spine.
  I must now recapitulate a little.
  After carefully considering    the views and studying the researches
of  Huxley,  Gegenbaur,    Balfour,  and Milnes Marshall, I am satisfied
that, in spite of the doubling up of the basis cranii, at the time of its
greatest flexure, there are rudiments of three pre-oral arches, related to
two pre-oral clefts, namely, the lacrymal and the nasal.
   That the mouth is caused by the blending together of a right
and left cleft is the view held (I find) by Dr. Allen Thomson; this
view, also, is held by Dr. Dohrn.                                 (See   “Balfour's Elasmobranchs,”

  The horseshoe fold of the mid-brain, the formation of the large
hollow bed for the eyeball, and the special function to which the true
segmental motor oculi nerve is confined, are all correlates of the
special development of those wild branches of the trigeminal and
facial nerves, namely, the ophthalmic and Vidian.
  This is tantamount to saying that the hypertrophy of the first and
second vesicles of the brain, and the large size of the optic vesicles
which are outgrowths from the first of these, with      the enfoldings                all

   The sixth nerve, or abducens, certainly arises from the ventral
surface of the hind-brain; this being so, it manifestly corresponds to
the anterior root of a spinal nerve; and as Milnes Marshall suggests,
it may belong to the trigeminal,                         to the facial,          or to both of         these
nerves.
  If low forms should turn up, in which the optic nerves were truly
segmental, and not direct vesicular outgrowths of the fore-brain, that
would only affect the classification here suggested, by showing that
our present Vertebrata have lost a segment through the extreme
specialization         of the optic nerves.
  As matters stand at present, we have, then, the nasal, lacrymal,
oral, tympanic, and branchial clefts; of these we see that there are
three in front of the tympanic, and there may be eight behind                                         it.
   Thus we get four pre-auditory and eight post-auditory clefts, with
their nerves;     we add the twelfth (hypoglossal)

the first post-oral or tympanic cleft is either suppressed or forms a
very slight inner pouch; it never opens externally in the Anura.
   In most of the Ganoids, as in the Selachians, the first post-oral cleft
persists     as the spiracle, but in osseous fishes -   it is a very temporary
structure.
  I have long suspected that the archaic (entomocranial) Vertebrata
were often supplied with a perfect circlet of branchial filaments
around their mouth.
  We know the first post-oral cleft to be    a branchial cleft with several
branchial filaments; Dr. Milnes Marshall's researches show that the
nasal folds of the embryo Selachian are developed in precisely the
same manner as the external branchials of the spiracular opening.
  These filaments become converted into a pseudo-branchia;              the
natural suggestion  is that the nasal folds, having   the same   structure,
and being formed in a homologous space, are indeed nothing more,
even   in the adult, than a modified pseudo-branchia.

that they are there extensions forward of the basal plates or “invest

                                   &
hind half of the trabeculae, in embryos of Selachians and Amphibians,
as to the pair of plates behind the trabeculae, or “para-chordals”
proper.
   Moreover, in several kinds of Urodeles, namely, (Spelerpes, Desmog
nathus, &c.,) there is a hindmost pair of para-chordal cartilages in
front of the functionally first vertebra.
   It behoves us, therefore, not to be led astray by mere words;             I
should prefer to call the paired cartilages of the notochordal region
of the head basi-neural; this term would satisfy not only some of
the best authors, such as Goette and Balfour, but it also expresses
what   I conceiveto be the actual nature of the parts.
  These right and left tracts of cartilage that form the main part of
the base or skull floor, and grow, more or less, over the overgrown
neural axis, are divisible into two regions, the hind region, which is
para-chordal, and the fore-part, which is pro-chordal.
                                                   I
   These essentially continuous tracts were, suppose, developed, first,
as a support to the increasing fore end of the neural axis, and from
the first were not clearly divided into intercalary (inter-neural) tracts;
and moreover, as take I      it,
                             they solidified earlier than the inter-neural
tracts  ofthe spinal region.
   That these latter, even, were not always from the first developed

340                Mr. W. K. Parker on                            the Development         of the        [Feb.        13,
into separate tracts     the existing skates and rays show; as the
tissue became more and more solid, it became, in relation to
the action of the muscle-plates, differentiated into a paired chain of
pieces of solid cartilage for the origin and insertion of the segmental
muscles.
   The “basi-neural” tracts of the head in existing Vertebrata are
developed very differently in different types, some parts forestalling
others in chondrification, and yet not similarly in all.
   In the Salachians (Scyllium, Raia, Pristiurus, see “Trans. Zool.
Soc.,” vol. i, Part IV, Plates 33–42) these tracts are                                       very broad, and
there are three regions made evident by the earlier                                          or later time at
which they become converted into hyaline cartilage.
   The middle region chondrifies first; this extends                                         from the nasal
sacs to the middle of the auditory capsules, and                                             answers to the
“trabeculae" without their “cornua.”
   The next tract is behind the trabeculae; it does not end close behind
the exit of the vagus, but runs on for a considerable distance into the
spine, without any sign of segmentation.
   The last to solidify                     its
                           embryonic, into hyaline, cartilage,  the inter                           is

                            early stage, narrow, for the nasal ’sacs are
                                       at     an
immense;       afterwards these structures get much further apart, and
allow     ofthe free development     the intervening cartilage.

stage), show   pair    broad para-chordal cartilages that embrace the
                       a               of

  Afterwards these rods grow up to, and then between, the nasal cap

sules, and then spread into dilated out-turned “cornua.”     By that
time another pair of para-chordal cartilages has appeared behind the
first, and in several species of Urodeles a much smaller pair behind
them.      Ido not find more than a very delicate layer of mesoblast
sheathing, the cephalic part of the notochord; and the inter-tra
becular cartilage in front of it merely fills the interspace of the tra
beculae in the nasal region; only in Siren and Salamandra do       see a               I
short “pre-nasal” rod.
   In most of these types the two last-mentioned being exceptional, the
para-chordal part of the trabeculae is absorbed, and only a selvege of
the para-chordal, proper, remains inside the ear-capsules, and at the
occipital condyle.
   In these types the basal cartilage does not grow up into the cavity
of the mid-brain as a “post-clinoid” wall, but this wall is very well
seen in the dog-fish (Scyllium).
   In the Batrachia (“Anura”) the trabeculae embrace the apex of
the notochord less, and develop their cornua sooner; the rest of the
basal plate, behind, is somewhat later in its appearance.     They have
a continuous  growth   of the inter-trabecular band, which is a flat floor
finishing the skull below; between the eyes, and between the nasal
sacs it grows into a wall; in front, this tract fills in the angle between
the trabecular cornua, and often (as in the tree-frogs) sends forth a
distinct pre-nasal rod, like that of the sharks.
   The Anura have a slight post-clinoid wall; their skull on the whole,
when finished, is intermediate between that of the Selachians and the
Urodeles.    Goette mentions the cartilaginous sheath of the cranial
notochord in Bombinator;                I
                                 find it very massive in the larvae of
Pseudis (when the limbs are just appearing); but, as a rule, this
sheath is very thin in tadpoles.
   In Teleostei (“Salmon's Skull,” Plates 1–8) the investing mass
chondrifies first, and is relatively much larger than the trabeculae:
they are only sub-distinct, and soon coalesce; the trabeculae grow very
rapidly, so that at the time of hatching there is a very massive
pro-chordal tract.
   By the middle of the second week after hatching the pro-chordal
tracts are quite distinct from the para-chordal, and                  them  lie   on
obliquely.
  By the middle        the first summer the tracts show,

              On the Organic and Actual Fore End of the Head.
    When the cephalic fold of the embryo is formed, the fast-growing
 cerebral bulbs hang over the yolk; the brain at this stage, by its own
bulk and weight, hangs down like a gourd.
   Of necessity, this throws together parts that would        be at some con
siderable distance     from each other; also the organic end is not the
actual end of the     head,      I
                              as have mentioned before: that is formed by
the   mid-brain;    the   fore-brain,  or terminal vesicle, looks downwards
and backwards.
                                                           &4
   In this  piece of morphology, as in studying the “receptacle of the
fig-tree,” we have to distinguish between the apparent apex and the
                                                                      -
true apex.
   But if organs have to be supported, the morphological force must
make good that which is thrown out of gear by this special hyper
trophy of parts, and the beams and rafters must be eked out.
   For this heavy nodding bend of the growing brain so doubles up
the undergrowths of the skeletal rudiments, that both the paired and
unpaired parts are stopped very near to the retral organic apex.
   Also the nasal sacs and optic vesicles, attached to, or growing from,
the fore-brain, are in a new position, and not, as they should be, in
the old straight line. .
   Indeed, the axis of these skeletons grows up far into the hollow
bend of the mid-brain, and the notochord turns over somewhat, and
then loses itself in the mesoblastic sheath, which gets very close to
the organic end of the brain.
   The paired tracts (para-chordals, both trabecular and post-tra
becular) grow up into that hollow, and there stop; their new out
growths (or eking out of the basi-neural tracts) begin again at the
base  of this ascending wall.
   Also the middle (unpaired) part begins again directly, in Chelone,
and in embryos (two-thirds ripe), in which the notochordal sheath
was ossifying to form the beginning of the “basi-occipital”              and
“basi-sphenoid,” the cephalostyle passed at once from the noto
chordal sheath to embrace and ossify the “inter-trabecular ” bar,
close below the pituitary body.
   That part of the basi-sphenoid which lies in front of and below the
pituitary body is formed by ossification, directly from the cepha
lostyle, of the unpaired solid pro-chordal tract of mesoblast; after
wards the bony matter spreads into the paired bars (trabeculae).
   But that middle bar came short of the pituitary space in the earlier
stages; for there the oral fold grew up to graft itself upon the fore
brain, close behind (or below, organically), the true apex or end of the
brain.
   Hence we    see,  that  if  the pituitary body were formed in an unbent

 344          Mr. W. K. Parker on      the Development  of the    [Feb.  13,
embryo,    it would be close below, and only a little behind, the fore
 end of the creature; in this supposed type the notochord would be only
 a little behind the punctum terminale.
    Now the fore and mid brain have at present only yielded to embryo
 logists one pair each of segmental nerves growing from their dorsal
 region; the hind brain is a series of enlargements.
    The two great pre-aural segmental nerves (5th and 7th) by            the
overfolding of the brain, are enabled to send on to the front of         the
 head their special branches, needed there, because of the specialization
 (for motion) of the third, and the specialization (for sensation) of the
first nerve.
    Thus these three-branched nerves have grown in harmony with the
 paired and unpaired basi-neural cartilages, and there is a due exten
sion forward of cartilages to the partially straightened skull, and a
due supply of nerves from behind.
    But in spite of all the metamorphoses of these parts, neural and
skeletal, if Dr. Milnes Marshall's observations (with which mine
accurately accord) be true, then we still have two true segments in
 point of the cleft (oral) which is forked over by the 5th nerve. It
could not be expected that the visceral arches and intervening clefts
would be otherwise than greatly modified and masked in the fore part
of the head, with its huge nervous centres, and highly complex organs
of special sense.
   The larvae of the Amphibia, especially of the “Anura,” have been
 very carefully studied by me, as likely to throw light upon the order of
development of the cranial-facial skeleton; the lamprey, also repre
senting those larvae permanently, has been the subject of much
thought, as a sort of practical pattern of those larvae.     In these forms
the extra-visceral skeleton of the head is much developed, and only
part of the true visceral (internal arches) appear.
   For the mouth in these forms is terminal, and its skeleton is made
up of sub-cutaneous     cartilages, the serial homologues of the subcu
taneous basket-work of the large respiratory pharynx of the lamprey.
   In that form the only true visceral arches developed are the mandi
bular and the hyoid;    a basal rudiment   of the internal branchial arches
exists as the “lingual cartilage.”
   The free mandible of the lamprey is packed up, and apparently
functionless, close behind the postero-superior “labial; ” the quad
rate portion of the “suspensorium,” is a mere point or style, with no
condyle.
   This suspensorium throws a fold of cartilage over the second
branch of the 5th nerve and the temporal muscle; this is not the
pterygoid cartilage, and is only seen in this type, in tadpoles, and
in some chondrosteous Ganoids, e.g., Planirostra,            as shown by
Mr. Bridge.

  Also the epi-hyal is in a low state of development; there is a
cerato-hyal and a basi-hyal piece, growing forward below, in front of
the large lingual (“basi-branchial ”) cartilage.
     But there is a copious growth of external cartilage both around the
terminal mouth and around the huge branchial pharynx; the cranial
box is at a low state of development, and the fore part of the head
shows no trace of a pre-oral arch.
   In tadpoles we have a very similar state of things, but there is a
real ascent; the suspensorium develops a quadrate condyle, and on this
the passive mandible is hinged.
   Round the mouth, cartilages quite like those of the lamprey, are
developed, but they are smaller; and there are only four bars
(pouches) in the walls of the pharynx; rudiments of four true intra
branchials also, are developed. A fifth subcutaneous cartilage appears
during metamorphosis, belonging to the mandibular arch; it becomes
the cartilaginous “annulus tympanicus.”
  After it has appeared the “styloid cartilage” of the lamprey
(“epi-hyal”)          is,

side, within the nasal cleft, the “pro-rhinal.”

   The glass then gave way, and all the phenomena disappeared except
the extreme ends of the cross, and the discharge through the hole,
where the glass had been perforated, was alone seen.
   The phenomena were seen by Mr. Cottrell, by Mr. Walter (the
second assistant), and by myself.      A fresh glass plate was at once
drilled in hopes of repeating the phenomena in the lecture next day,
but owing to sparks springing round we did not succeed in perforating
the glass, and therefore    saw only the faint return of light described
by Dr. Kerr.
   Some more glasses have been prepared and their terminals            in
sulated, and   I now propose to make another attempt to repeat the new
effects before the Royal Society.

   I. “On Electrical Insulation in High Vacua.”           By    WILLIAM
             CROOKES, F.R.S. Received February         6, 1879.
    The experiments    here described were tried nearly two years ago.
 They were suggested by some observations      I  was then making on the
 passage of an induction current through highly exhausted tubes. The
 main branch of the research being likely to occupy my attention for
 some time,    I may be unable to return to these less important off
 shoots.   I have ventured, therefore, to embody them in a short note
 for the “Proceedings of the Royal Society.”
    A pair of gold leaves were mounted, as for an electroscope, in a
 bulb blown from English lead glass tubing.      The leaves were attached
 to a glass stem and the lower part of the bulb was drawn out for
 sealing to a Sprengel pump as shown at fig. 1. A stick of ebonite
 excited by friction was generally used as the source of electricity, but
 any other source will do equally well, provided it is not too powerful.
    No special attention was paid to the action of electricity on the
 leaves  in air or at moderate vacua, as it agreed with what is already
 well known.     The exhaustion was pushed to a very high degree (about
 the  millionth of an atmosphere), when it was found that the excited

ebonite had a much greater effect on the gold leaves than at a low
exhaustion; for a long time however          I was not able to charge t
leaves   permanently,  in consequence    of their falling together as so
as the source of electricity was removed.
                                    FIG. 1.
   When a hot substance was brought near the bulb facing a gold le
so as to warm the glass, molecular repulsion took place, and the leav
retreated from the warm spot, standing out at an angle of about 4.
As the glass cooled the leaves resumed their former vertical position
   While the leaves were repelled from the hot glass, the excit
ebonite had a very powerful action on them, and if it were broug
near hastily, the leaves flew off to the side of the glass, destroying t
apparatus.    By careful management and repeated trials, however, t
ebonite could be brought near the warm spot of glass, the leav
suddenly extending at an angle to each other. The appearance was
if a spark had been able to pass across the bridge formed by the li
of advancing    and retreating molecules connecting the hot glass wi
the gold leaves.    On the ebonite being removed and the glass allow
to  cool, it was found that the repulsion of the leaves was permane
The rubbed ebonite would attract and repel them as it was moved
and fro, but the angle formed by the leaves with one another
mained unchanged.       A warm body brought near the glass oppos
one leaf would repel the pair as a whole; on then warming the oppos
side of the glass repulsion on that side took place, the angle of t
leaves being somewhat diminished, but on cooling the leaves open
again to their former extent.
   When the glass bulb was strongly heated by a spirit flame t
leaves suddenly discharged and fell together.
   Another bulb (fig. 2) was prepared, containing a plate of mica,
which could be suddenly placed between the gold leaves, bb. T

plate of mica was longer and wider than the gold leaves, and was con
nected with a small piece of iron wire, capable of moving up and

down a tube sealed into the top of the bulb.  By means of an outside
magnet the mica plate could thus be lowered between the gold leaves
or raised out of their way, as desired.   The tube was exhausted to
about the millionth of an atmosphere, the mica plate being held quite
above the leaves.   One side of the bulb was then heated, and the
                                 FIG. 3.

     mica plate was now carefully lowered.   As it came between th
     leaves they diverged further apart, and kept so as long as the
     plate was between them.    On removing the plate the leaves reass
     their former   divergence.  This could be repeated any numb
     times.
         A similar  piece of apparatus (fig. 3) was made, only instead

     covered the electrified leaves, it had the effect of diminishing the
     which they formed with each other.
       The following experiments were also tried:—the leaves
     separated about 160°, as at fig. 4, A, one side of the tube was sl

    Fig. 4, C, shows the two positions of the leaves, aa before applying
 heat to the side c of the tube, and bb after heating the glass at c.
    The tube was now heated on both sides, causing the leaves to
 come nearer together as shown at fig. 4, D. While the glass was
 warm the cylinder was raised so that it surrounded the leaves:
 this caused them to get a little closer together, and they kept in this
 position, shown at E, after the whole apparatus was quite cold.
    After remaining thus for some time, the cylinder was lowered, and
 the leaves widened out and took up the position shown at bb, fig. 4, C.
 They did not return to the position aa, showing that their divergence
 was now owing to their own mutual repulsion, and not to an attrac
 tion of one or other to the electrified glass.

    In December, 1877, totally immersed one of these exhausted glass
 bulbs in a vessel of water; the gold leaves having previously been
 charged, and standing at an angle of 112° from one another, as at fig. 5.
 The water was connected electrically with “earth,” and the whole
 was set aside in a cabinet on the 1st of January, 1878.
    At the present time, after having remained in this condition for
 thirteen months, the leaves form exactly the same angle with one
 another which they did when they were first put in the cabinet.

experiments were next repeated, both with rubidium and cae

chlorides along with metallic lithium. The two violet lines of rubidium
and the two blue lines of caesium were reversed, as when sodium was
used instead of lithium, and as the lithium gave no sensible vapour,
the observations could easily be continued    for a much longer time with
the same tubes.    No other absorption lines could be discerned. It may
be observed, however, that it is not easy to obtain a source of light
sufficiently rich in the least refrangible red to allow of observations on
the absorption of light so little refrangible as the red rubidium lines.
A platinum wire, heated nearly to fusion by an electric current,
appeared to give the brightest light in this part of the spectrum, but
of that light no definite absorption by the rubidium could be observed
in the red. We then had some mixtures of carbonate of caesium with
carbon, and of carbonate of rubidium with carbon, prepared by
charring the tartrates; and observed the results of heating these
mixtures in narrow porcelain tubes, placed vertically in a furnace, as
described in our first communication on this subject (“Proc. Roy.
Soc.,” vol.   xxvii).  A  small quantity of the caesium mixture, intro
duced into a tube at a bright red heat, showed instantly the two blue lines
reversed and so much expanded as to be almost in contact. The width
of the dark lines decreased as the caesium evaporated, but they remained
quite distinct for a very long time. A similar effect was produced by
the rubidium mixture, only it was necessary to have the tube very much
hotter, in order to get enough of violet light to see the reversal of the
rubidium lines. In this case the two lines were so much expanded as
to form one broad dark band, which gradually resolved itself into two
as the rubidium evaporated.         The reversal of these lines of caesium
and rubidium seems to take place almost or quite as readily as that of
the D lines by sodium, and the vapours of those metals must be
extremely opaque to the light of the refrangibility absorbed, for the
absorption    was conspicuous when only very-minute quantities of the
metals were present. The red, yellow, and green parts of the spectrum
were carefully searched for absorption lines, but none due to caesium
or rubidium could be detected in any case.         It is perhaps worthy of
remark that the liberation of such extremely electro-positive elements
as caesium and rubidium from their chlorides by sodium and by lithium,
though    it is probably only partial, is a proof, if proof were wanting,
that so-called chemical affinity only takes a part in determining the
grouping of the elements in such mixtures; and it is probable that the
equilibrium arrived at in any such case is a dynamical or mobile equili
brium, continually varying with change of temperature.
   Our next experiments were with charred cream of tartar in iron
tubes, arranged as before.         In this case a broad absorption band
appeared, extending over the space from about wave-length 5,700 to
5,775, and in some cases still wider, with edges ill-defined, especially
 the more refrangible edge.     By placing the charred cream of tartar in

    When lithium     carbonate was introduced   the red line was at once
 seen reversed,  but not much expanded. When some aluminium was
 added, the lithium blue line (wave-length 4,604) was seen with a dark
 line in the middle for a short time only. The green line of lithium
 was very bright indeed, and appeared somewhat expanded on the
 addition of aluminium, but showed no reversal.
    On putting some baryta into the crucible the line with wave-length
 5,535 was reversed, appearing very black but narrow.          No other
 barium line could be seen reversed in that crucible, but in another
 crucible into which magnesia had been introduced, a dark line, with
 wave-length about 4,930, was observed, which may probably be ascribed
 to barium.
    With magnesia and aluminium the least refrangible of the    b group
 was seen reversed, all the b group being expanded.
    When silver was introduced, on drawing the poles apart, both the
 brightest green lines (wave-lengths 5,464 and 5,209) were seen for a
 short time with a black line down the middle.
    Frequently on parting the poles, whatever might be the substance
in the crucible, the whole of the brightest part of the spectrum, from
the orange to the blue, appeared filled with dark lines, all equidistant
and equally dark, like a fine grating. With a high dispersion these
lines are seen to be ill-defined at the edges. We can only suppose
them to be a banded spectrum of some compound of carbon.
    The lime crucibles are very quickly destroyed, but we hope to get
some more compact lime than we have hitherto had, and to employ a
more powerful electric current.       The use of carbon or magnesia for
crucibles  will, we anticipate,  enable experiments of this kind to be
extended much further, and applied to various reactions taking place
at the temperature of the arc. In the case of carbon crucibles the
block of carbon itself will form one electrode, the other electrode

  1. The authors of this paper have devoted much time durin
past twelve months to a study of sonorous vibrations and the repr
tion of speech. The invention of the phonograph has proved a
stimulus to this study.    Many have worked in the same field,
many of the facts elicited by the authors have been anticipate
those who have been able to give more continuous study to the su
Nevertheless, the mode of enquiry, the apparatus employed, an
results obtained are thought to be of sufficient novelty to justify
being brought before the Royal Society.
   2. The curves traced by the vibrating disk of the phonograp
tinfoil, whether examined microscopically or reproduced by a spec
pantelograph, were soon found to be insufficiently delicate to giv
nicer shades of sound, and to fail to indicate the true curve of \
tions in all cases. This is shown by the imperfect reproducti
speech by the phonograph itself; the merging of the labial and c
sounds into one another, and the absence of all the sibilants
generally of the “noises” of speech.    The phonograph is in rea
very imperfect speaker, and it requires the aid of much imagir
and considerable guessing to follow       its
                                          reproductions.     pro

music with wonderful perfection, but it fails to reproduce most of the
“noises” of which speech is so largely made up. The telephone is
also deficient in this respect, though to a much less degree.
   3. The first object of the authors was to find a disk which would
vibrate to the finest shades of sonorous vibrations, and which would
be free from   those characteristic and “personal” partials which are
nearly inseparable from all vibrating disks, and which interfere with
their true action. After innumerable experiments, on almost all known
forms and substances, a stretched membrane of thin india-rubber
rendered rigid by a cone of paper, was found to give the best effects.
Such a disk was applied to the telephone and the phonograph with
fair results, and the apparatus shown in fig. 1 was then constructed to
record its vibrations.   To the centre of the cone ab, shown in perspec
tive and section in fig. 1, which was placed in a mouthpiece similar to
that of a phonograph, was attached an extremely fine glass tube (g),
which acted as a pen. The ink employed was aniline dye, and it was
drawn through the pen by the very slight friction exerted between its
point and the paper. The paper (p) on which the curves were to be
drawn was the broad band frequently used for telegraphic purposes,
and it was moved under the pen by mechanism similar to that used in
the Wheatstone automatic telegraph apparatus, at a speed which could
be varied at will from 1 to 18 inches per second.
  4. In this way curves were obtained illustrating the sonorous
vibrations due to the tones of speech, but their form        was not so
perfect as could have been wished, due to the imperfections of the
disk, as well as, perhaps, to the friction of the pen failing to indicate
the higher upper partials.     Run at a slow speed, this instrument
records the variations of air pressure in front of the lips; run at a
high speed it records both air pressure and sonorous vibrations.       It
thus combines the functions of Barlow's logograph and Leon Scott's
phonautograph.
  5. It is intended, in this paper, to confine our observations to those
facts illustrating vowel sounds, a graphic representation of which,
drawn by the new phonautograph, is given in the following sketch
(fig. 2).
   6. Helmholtz's theory of vowel sounds is this:—Vowels are compound
musical tones, or resultant sounds formed by the combination of certain
components or simple tones called partials.       The first partial, which
determines the pitch of the whole, is called the prime, and the others
    upper partials.    The partials depend upon the reinforcements due
to its
    the cavity of   the mouth.   Vowels     do
                                           not depend upon the pitch    of
the  prime  alone,  or   on
                          the grouping    or
                                          harmony      the partials alone,
                                                      of
but on both.     The ear must distinguish each component;        it   must
recognise the kind   of  cavity producing the reinforcements, and there
fore    determines the different vowels. This theory has been partly

  All the subsidiary vowels, such as uh, aw, a, take up intermediate
positions in this scale, so that, in fact, we may say that there is a
vowel spectrum, in which the different sounds merge into each other
by almost imperceptible gradations, and hence, probably, the difference
in dialectical pronunciation.
   11. In the following investigation, a method opposite to that of
Messrs. Fleeming Jenkin and Ewing has been adopted, i.e., the
question has been attacked by the method of synthesis.     It has been
assumed that vowels are compounded of a prime sound and certain
upper partials, and the number of these partials has, for convenience,
been taken as 8, although there are many more.       Indeed, we have
taken in some cases, the 10th, 12th, and 16th.       Now,  since each
partial can be considered as a simple harmonic curve, if we assume
the pitch of a prime to be constant, then it would be possible, by
means of a machine, to represent and vary each partial in phase and
in amplitude. For this purpose an instrument was constructed, which
we call “the synthetic curve machine,” in which a number of toothed
wheels, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, &c. (figs. 3 and 4) are mounted on
steel pins or axes rigidly fixed on a board, so that they will revolve
together, and the numbers of their teeth are so calculated that
during one revolution of the wheel A, B will make two, C three,
D four, E five, F six, G seven, H eight revolutions, and so on. The
wheel     I
         has, on its prolonged axis, a small crank, by means of
which the whole system of wheels can be rotated. On the same
axis is a pinion             I',

        an excellent syren, and all the facts illustrated by the apparatu

        Moreover, it forms the basis of a new musical instrument which th
        has been no time as yet to mature.
            18. In the hope of getting more perfect definition, another macl
        was now made upon which disks were fitted, whose peripheries v
        cut in exact copy of the curve produced by the synthetic cu
        machine.      These curves were transmitted by vibration to the receiv
        diaphragm of a phonógraph, and really formed an “automatic pho
        graph.” The automatic phonograph consists of an axle A, fig. 9, ab
        6 inches long, one end of which carries a fly-wheel B, and the ol
        end a grooved pulley C, round which a band or gut passes fro
        driving wheel D, fitted with a crank handle E.              On rotating
- *-* * driving wheel, the long axle is caused to make about three revolut
     -! to one of the wheel.
            On the long axle are placed, in such a manner that they can ea

           A diaphragm G with spring and frame H, similar to that in a pho

        The number of periods or resultant vibrations recurring on each w.
        or disk has for convenience        been  taken at thirty. Thus, when
        driving wheel is rotated about twice per second, 180 to 200 vibrat
        are caused, resulting in a note at     f or g in the musical scale.
            A number of combinations of curves has been cut on the circl
         ferences of the brass disks, representing each vowel sound with cer
        variations of the partials, as experience determined.      These disks v
        then    placed  on the   axle, and the sounds most    resembling  the vo
        sounds of the human voice were easily recognised.

                               it was found that from about to b in the mus
        scale, the sound oo consists mainly of the first partial or prime.    Bu
        maintain the oo character descending the scale, the second and th
        partials became slightly necessary.
           20. The prominent partial in the vowel sound 0 at the same p.
        is the second, while the first can be reduced considerably.       The th
        and fourth     partials have to be used as the sound descends the sc
        otherwise what is 0 at say b flat, will become oo an octave lower.

        chiefly of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth partials at the above pi

more prominence to the second, third, and fourth partials will result

the fifth and sixth partials.
  22. A very good and full ah is obtained by having all the partials
equally represented, from the first to the eighth; and this really pro
bably takes place when the human voice pronounces this vowel, as, in
so doing, the mouth cavity is fully opened, so as to favour most of
the partials.

   27. It follows from this investigation as far as it has gone, that our
knowledge of vowel sounds is not perfect. The principal proof of this
is the fact that vowels cannot be reproduced exactly by mechanical
means.     Something is always missing—probably the noises due to the
rush of air through the teeth, and against the tongue and lips.
   28. The curves (fig. 10) arrived at synthetically do not differ very
materially   from those arrived at analytically by Helmholtz (fig. 6).
They principally differ in the prominence of the prime.           But the
prime can be dispensed with altogether.           Curves produced by the
synthetic machine, compounded of the different partials without their
prime, show that there exist beats or resultant sounds.     A vowel sound
of the pitch of the prime may be produced by certain partials alone,
without sounding the prime at all. The beat in fact becomes the
prime.    This point is clearly illustrated, orally, by the automatic
phonograph, and graphically by the sketch (fig. 11), drawn by the
synthetic curve machine.        In fact, every two partials of numbers
indivisible by any common multiple, if sounded alone, reproduce by
their beats the prime itself. Thus, the third and the fifth partials,
or the second and the third, &c., will result in the reproduction
of the prime.     In fact, fig. 11 illustrates not only this, but it shows
that when the number of partials introduced is increased, the beats
become more and more pronounced.
                        II.—The    Loudness  of Sound.
   29. Another point remaining for investigation arising out of this
inquiry, is the true theory of the loudness of sound. It is thought by
the authors that loudness does not depend upon amplitude of vibration
only, but also upon the quantity of air put into vibration; and, therefore,
there exists an absolutely physical magnitude in acoustics analogous to
that of quantity of electricity or quantity of heat, and which may be
called the quantity of sound. This can be shown experimentally by con
structing three disks like those in fig. 1, whose diameters increase in
arithmetical ratio. When these disks are vibrated by the same curve
by the automatic phonograph, or when they are thrown into vibra
tion by tuning forks, it will be found that the intensity of sound
increases in a surprising ratio. The amplitude remains just the same;
the area under vibration alone increases.          Thus, in the automatic
phonograph, for two notes, one of which is an octave higher than the
other, the area ought probably to be diminished one-half for the
higher to produce equal loudness. Similarly for the same note, if
we increase the area to be vibrated in its reproduction, it will be
found that, as the area increases, so does the loudness of the sound
emitted.    In fact, in the automatic phonograph the diameter of the
sounding disk ought, if it were possible, to vary with the pitch of
each note, to produce equal intensity of sound.

while the aluminium lines remain with dark middles for a long time.
When a mixture of lime and potassium carbonate (to produce a
stronger current of vapour in the tube) was introduced into a carbon
erucible the calcium (?) line with wave-length 4,095 was seen strongly
reversed, and the group of three lines with wave-lengths           4,425,
4,434, and 4,454 were all reversed, the least refrangible being the most
strongly reversed, and remaining so the longest, while the most
refrangible was least strongly reversed and for the shortest time.
   Besides these reversals, which were regularly observed, the following
were noticed by us as occurring in lime crucibles but with less
certainty, perhaps only at the highest temperatures.         Dark bands
appearing for a short time and dwindling into sharp dark lines with
wave-lengths about 6,040 and 6,068 (perhaps due to the oxide); a
dark line replacing the most refrangible of a well-marked group of
several bright lines with wave-length 5,581 (or possibly the brighter
line 5,588); and the lines with wave-lengths 6,121 and 6,161 reversed
simultaneously for an instant and reappearing bright immediately;
and the line with wave-length 5,188 reversed. When aluminium was
put into the crucible only the two lines of that metal between H and K
were seen reversed. The lines at the red end remained steadily bright.
   When some magnesium was put into a lime crucible, the b group
expanded a little without appearing reversed, but when some alu
minium was added, the least refrangible of the three lines appeared
with a dark middle, and on adding more magnesium the second line
put on the same appearance; and lastly, the most refrangible was
reversed in like manner. The least refrangible of the three remained
reversed for some time; and the order of reversibility of the group is
the inverse of that of refrangibility.   Of the other magnesium lines,
that in the yellowish-green (wave-length 5,527) was much expanded,
the blue line (wave-length 4,703), and a line still more refrangible than
the hitherto recorded lines, with wave-length 4,354, was still more
expanded each time that magnesium was added. These last two lines
 expanded much more on their less refrangible than on their more
refrangible sides, and were not seen reversed.      The bright blue line
 (wave-length 4,481) seen when the spark is used, was not visible either
 bright or reversed; and this seems to be in agreement with Capron's
 photographs, which show this line very strong with the spark but not
 with the arc.
    The following experiments were made in carbon crucibles:—
   When strontia was put in the lines with wave-lengths 4,607, 4,215
 and 4,079 were all seen with dark lines in the middle, but no reversal
 of any strontium line less refrangible could be seen. After adding
 some aluminium and some potassium carbonate to increase the current
 of vapour, no reversal of any strontium red line could be detected,
 though momentary cloudy dark bands were seen in the red when

1879.]        on the Reversal of the Lines fo Metallic Vapours.      369
fresh strontia was thrown in.         Two dark lines were   seen  in the
extreme red, which proved to be the potassium lines reversed (wave
lengths 7,670 and 7,700).
     With a mixture of barium and potassium carbonates the line with
wave-length 5,535 was strongly reversed, and that with wave-length
4,933 distinctly so. When barium chlorate was dropped into a cruci
ble, the four lines with wave-lengths 4,553, 4,933, 5,535, and 5,518,
were reversed, and as they remained so for some time, it is probable
that the action of the oxygen of the chlorate had nothing to do with the
result. The last-named line (5,518) was the least strongly reversed.
     To observe particularly the effects of potassium a mixture of lime
and potassium carbonate previously ignited was thrown in. The violet
lines of potassium, wave-length 4,044, came out immediately as a broad
black band, which soon resolved into two narrower dark bands having
 wave-lengths nearly 4,042 and 4,045. On turning to the red end the
two extreme red lines were both seen reversed. No lines of potassium
 between the two extremes could be seen reversed, but the group of
 three yellow lines were all expanded though not nebulous, and other
 lines in the green were seen much expanded.       These observations on
 potassium were more than once repeated with the same results.
     Using sodium carbonate only the D lines were seen reversed though
 the other lines were expanded, and the pairs in the green had each
 become a very broad nebulous band, and D almost as broad a black
 band. When sodium chlorate was dropped into a crucible, the pair of
 lines with wave-lengths 5,681, 5,687, were both momentarily reversed,
 the latter much more strongly than the former.
     When a very little charred rubidium tartrate was put in, the two
 violet lines were sharply reversed, appearing only as black lines on a
 continuous light background. Turning to the red end, the more refran
 gible of the two lines in the extreme red (wave-length 7,800) was seen
 to have a decided dark line in the middle, and it continued so for some
 time.     The addition of more rubidium failed to cause any reversal of
 the extreme red line, or of any but the three lines already mentioned.
     On putting some lithium carbonate into the crucible, the violet line
 of lithium appeared as a nebulous band, and on adding some aluminium
  this violet band became enormously expanded, but showed no reversal.
  The blue lithium line (wave-length 4,604) was well reversed, as was
  also the red line, while a fine dark line passed through the middle of
  the orange line.    On adding now a mixture of aluminium filings, and
  carbonates of lithium and potassium, the red line became a broad
  black band, and the orange line was well reversed. The green line
  was exceedingly bright, but not nebulous or reversed, and the violet
  line still remained much expanded, but unreversed. With regard to
  the  green  lithium line, we may remark that we have no doubt what
  ever that it belongs to lithium, and that there must have been some

 37 ()                 Profs. Liveing and Dewar                                  [Feb. 27,
 mistake    in Thalén's observation, which ascribed it to caesium. We
 have never detected this line with caesium, which, on the other hand,
 seems always to give the characteristic blue lines, both in the spark
 and in the flame, as well as to give the same lines reversed when its
 vapour is used as an absorbent.
     When metallic indium was introduced into the crucible, both the
 lines with wave-lengths 4,101 and 4,509 were at once seen strongly
 reversed, and so continued for some time.                No other absorption line
 of indium could be detected.
     It is apparent that the expansion of lines, so often observed when
 fresh materials are introduced, must be ascribed to increase in the
 density of the vapours, not to any increase of temperature. Moreover,
 the length of tube which reaches a very high temperature in the expe
riments above described is very short in the lime crucibles, and still
shorter in the carbon crucibles, so that the reversing layer is also short
in many cases. We are, therefore, directing our attention to the means
of heating up a longer length of the tubes, either by introducing oxy
hydrogen jets, or additional electric arcs one above another; and also
to the introduction of reducing gas (hydrogen or carbonic oxide) to
counteract the oxidising action of the air which is drawn in through
the lateral openings.
    The curious behaviour of the lines of different spectra with regard
to reversal has induced us to compare the bright lines of the chromo
sphere of the sun, as observed by Young, with those that are reversed
in our crucibles.    It is well known that some of the principal lines of
metals giving comparatively simple spectra, such as lithium, aluminium,
strontium, and potassium, are not represented amongst the dark lines
of Fraunhofer, while other lines of those metals are seen: and an
examination of the bright chromospheric lines shows that special rays
highly characteristic of bodies which appear from other rays to be
       :: * :*
present in the chromosphere are absent, or are less frequent in their
occurrence than others.
    In  the following tables the relation between our observations                     on
reversals and Young's on the chromospheric lines is shown.

I. “Observations       on the   Physiology of the Nervous System of
       the Crayfish (Astacus Fluviatilis).”       By JAMES WARD, M.A.,
       Fellow of   Trinity   College,   Cambridge.     Communicated by
       MICHAEL FOSTER, M.D., F.R.S., Praelector of Trinity College,
       Cambridge.      Received February 17, 1879.
   I. When one of the supra-oesophageal commissures is divided, the whole
body of the crayfish on the injured side is more or less enfeebled, with
                                                             2 F 2

380            Mr.   J.   Ward.           On the Physiology          of   the Nervous        [Mar.   6,
the exception of the swimmerets and possibly the gnathites. The change
is most marked in the    antennae and eye-stalks, which barely respond
to considerable excitation;   and after these perhaps in the abdomen,
the power of swimming or turning over being generally entirely lost.
The muscles connecting the abdominal segments on the injured side
are relaxed, and the tail-fin appendages on that side are no longer
spread out in the normal manner, but remain more or less overlapping
and hang down like broken limbs.    This leads to a want of symmetry
which is most conspicuous    during  movement: it almost disappears
when the nervous connexion with the abdomen is entirely severed by
a cut between the first and second segments.   No clear difference is
discernible in the pinch of the two chelae, but in prehension and
locomotion all the limbs on the side of the injury are weakened.   In
consequence of this, when walking forward the course taken is
towards the sound side, in backing the course is towards the injured
side. The chelae during progression show a bias towards the sound
side; that is to say, when the right commissure is cut, they are both
directed                          on the animal's left, and vice versä
               towards some position
when the left commissure is cut. There is a tendency when walking
to flop suddenly forwards, and in some cases to “wabble” from side to
side.
  II.  So long, however, as the other commissure remains intact, there
is no lack of spontaneity and purpose in the movements of the cray
fish; but when this too is severed, that                       is,
                                            when both commissures con
necting the supra- with the sub-aesophageal ganglion are divided, every
thing     the kind disappears, save that occasionally the antennae are
          of
waved about       the normal fashion, though much more feebly.
                      in                                                The
animal lies          on
                its back, the maxillipedes, the chelae, and the first three
pair  oflegs, for the most part, swinging slowly       and fro       perfect to         in
tempo; not, however,                 as
                           the swimmerets   do, both sides  synchronously,
but with the movements          one side alternating with those
                                            of                        the                      of
other.  On     very  slight
                     a      disturbance, and      intervals, without anyat
obvious cause, this rhythmic swing gives place       feeding     “preen      to         or
ing  ” movements, the last being chiefly confined      the fourth pair          to                   of
legs, which take     part  nothe  rhythmicinswing.    The feeding move
ments are        a    perfect        mimicry     of   the movements made when food                   is
actually seized. These last appear                  respects perfectly co
                                                         to   be   in     all
ordinated;      much  so,
                     so    indeed, that the chelate legs will wait their
turn     pass their morsel
          to                   the mouth when scraps are placed
                                          to                                                   in    all
of them       once. But neither they, nor the chelae, nor the posterior
               at
maxillipedes, show any selective power, even the animal's own
antennae being seized: the first evidence      taste appears when theof
food gets within the gape                  of
                              the mandibles.
                           on
   When placed       table, the ambulatory legs are straightened out
                           a                                                                         so
as   to   lift the body         as
                                 if       upon stilts,    the half flexed abdomen barely

touching the ground with the tail-fin.        In this position the animal
will remain for a minute or       so, one or more cf the chelate legs
engaging in feeding movements, while the last pair are doing their
best to preen the abdomen. At length there is an attempt at locomo
tion, the limbs being moved slowly and in a tottering fashion, though
with fair co-ordination, till after a few steps, having no power to
recover its equilibrium, the animal rolls over helplessly on to its back.
In some cases the chelae were folded rigidly across each other so as to
render locomotion impossible.
   III.  When both commissures are divided behind the sub-osophageal
ganglion, the antennae are moved more frequently and more vigorously
than in the last case: the eye-stalks too are oftener in motion. The
rhythmic swing is not infrequent in the posterior maxillipedes, but
very exceptional and of very short duration elsewhere,           Preening
movements are more common than under the last         head,  and in these
all four pairs oftener take part; but feeding movements, save after
external   excitation, are quite exceptional.    Then, however, they are
vigorous enough, but the chelate legs are very uncertain in their aims
at the mouth, do not loose their hold of the food when they get it there,
and all of them attempt to crowd food into the mouth together.        But
the food is frequently rejected: in two cases out of three in which the
experiment was tried, this “sulkiness”     disappeared on dividing the
supra-oesophageal commissures.
   On the table these crayfish are unable to support themselves, the
chelae sprawl helplessly on either side and the legs are for the most
part doubled up under the body. The posterior maxillipedes alone
retain their wonted strength, and by means of these the cephalothorax
is raised from the ground two or three times a minute till they are
exhausted; the antennae too being waved vigorously all the time.
   IV. In three cases in which a longitudinal division of the supra
aesophageal ganglion was accomplished fairly satisfactorily, the animal
assumed the stilted position above described, but the abdomen, instead
of being bent sharply downwards, was alternately elevated to the
utmost and then depressed and sometimes curved rigidly backwards
for a minute or more: at which times, owing to the rigor of the
chelae, it was possible to make the animal stand upon its head.     These
animals had considerable power of maintaining equilibrium and were
active in the water, making, however, very pronounced “circus-move
ments.”     Their ambulatory legs were always obedient to the impulse
to walk, and never betook themselves to feeding or preening move
ments at such times.
   From the foregoing it may perhaps, with more or less probability,
be inferred :—
   (a.) That there is no decussation of the longitudinal fibres in the
nervous system of the crayfish.

  (b.) That on the presence of the supra-oesophageal ganglion depend
(1) the spontaneous activity of the animal as a whole, or what might
be called its volitional activity; (2) the power to inhibit the aimless
and wasteful mechanical activity of the lower centres;         (3) the
power to maintain equilibrium; and (4) the use of the abdomen in
swimming.
   (c.) That the sub-oesophageal ganglia are the centres for co
ordinating (1) the locomotive* and (2) the feeding movements, and
(3) for the rhythmic swing described under          (The stilted gait                 II.                                     in

connected with the other centres   being then disabled for locomotion,

considerable amount                          of   motor energy.)
     (d.) That there   much less solidarity,

they never, at any time, participated in the rhythmic swing or feeding
movements of these last.
   Gentle pressure on the anus or the sexual organs excites or inhibits
the swimmerets, according as they are already at rest or in motion,
and leads, where possible, to a folding of the abdomen. The feeding
and preening movements are also, as a rule, brought to a complete
standstill by slight irritation of the anus, the after movements being
in all cases more violent. So long as the nervous connexion with the
tail-fin remained intact, the swimmerets can be excited to considerable
activity by touching this region, but when this connexion is destroyed,
it is with difficulty they are made to move at all.
   The experiments, of which the above is a brief and preliminary
account, were carried on at the Physiological Laboratory, Cambridge.

have a fairly wide range. Ant. rosacea ranges from the north of
Scotland to the Mediterranean, while Ant. Eschrichtii is found over a
much wider area. It is the common Arctic species, having been
obtained by our own expedition under Nares, as far north as lat. 81° N.,
while the expeditions of Sweden, Norway, and other countries have
found it abundant in the seas of Spitzbergen and Nova Zembla. It is
well known on the American coast, and was dredged by the “Chal
lenger” off Halifax, while the “Porcupine” met with it in the “cold
area ” of the North Atlantic.
   The “Challenger” dredgings round Heard Island yielded several
specimens which agree so very closely with Ant. Eschrichtii that   am                                       I
very strongly inclined to believe in the identity of the southern and
northern forms. There are, however, some minor points of difference
between them, and the southern form may really turn out to be the
representative species of Ant. Eschrichtii, but not identical with                                         it.  I
cannot venture    give definite opinion upon this point until have

these are not too common. A few                           specimens are known from the
Gault, Greensand, and Bath Oolite,                        while the Jurassic beds of the
Continent have yielded Solanocrinus                          and a few little known forms
from the Solenhofen slate (Pterocoma,                        Saccocoma).
   It should be noted, however, at the same time, that Tertiary Coma
tulae are also very rare, Philippi's Alecto alticeps, from the Sicilian
Tertiaries being the only one which        can call to mind.     I
                                                               This is
scarcely surprising when it is remembered that the distribution of
modern Comatula is chiefly in the tropics and temperate zones, there
being but few Arctic or sub-Arctic species. The Australian Tertiaries
might possibly yield different results.
  The voyage of the “Challenger” has settled two curious questions
in connexion with the Crinoids, the origin of which is due to Lovén.
They refer to Hyponome Sarsii, a so-called recent Cystid, and to
Phanogenia,             new genus of the Comatulidae.

anything like the relative size of the reniform plates at the sides of
the grooves of Rhizocrinus, Hyocrinus, and Bathycrinus.     They are all
folded down more or less   completely  over the grooves,  which are thus
converted into tunnels; while the mouth is also rendered more or less
invisible by the folding over it of the plated leaflets around the edges
of the peristome. The closure of the grooves is much more perfect
in some specimens than in others and may extend far out on to the
ar"InS.
  The plates in the marginal leaflets are probably moveable as the
unplated leaflets are in Antedon rosacea; so that they can be erected
when the arms are spread out, leaving the grooves open for food
particles to travel towards the mouth. On the other hand, when the
arms are all contracted over the disk, the marginal plates fold over
the grooves and cover them                  in.

or three faint indications of sockets, very much as in the stellate
centrodorsal of Phanogenia.
  Stage 4. The adult condition succeeds to this. The centrodorsal is a
simple pentagonal plate 3.5–4 millims. in diameter, and situated
entirely within, and on the same level as, the radial pentagon.
   This series of changes in the centrodorsal does not proceed any
farther in Act. Jukesii, but in other species it may continue still farther,
or on the other hand close sooner. Thus the centrodorsal of a
gigantic Actinometra in Professor Semper's Philippine collection is in
stage 2; while those of two other “Challenger” species, from the
same locality and equally large, exhibit the next stage of meta
morphosis (5).
   Stage 5. In No. 37 (of my list) the centrodorsal is a pentagonal
disk without a trace of cirrhus sockets. It is slightly below the level
of the radials, and is only in contact with them by its inter-radial
angles, its sides being separated from their inner margins                                      by linear
clefts.
   No. 49 is in the same condition, and so are two others of Semper's
Philippine species, except that one or two minute cirrhus stumps still
 remain on the centrodorsal.     Another large “Challenger” species,
also from the   Philippines, is represented by four specimens.   All of
these show the gradual obliteration of the cirrhus sockets and the
lowering of the centrodorsal to the level of the radial pentagon, or
even below                 it,
                together with the presence    clefts  its sides. These    of   at
may occasionally appear before the loss      the small cirrhus stumps,of
as   is   the case               in   Phanogenia.

taking up more than half the whole dorsal face of the radial, while in
the younger specimen it occupies much less than half.
  The effect of this change in the component parts of the radial
pentagon is to give its central synosteal surface a considerable slope
inwards and downwards, so that the whole, when viewed from above,
has the form of a wide and shallow funnel. The rim of the funnel
(outer dorsal surfaces of the radials) is thick in the young specimen,
but does not increase with the growth of the interior (inner dorsal
surfaces). Consequently, the centrodorsal which forms, as it were, a
plug fitting into the funnel, slips farther and farther down into       until                                    it,

Neither of these two authors has referred to my statements at all, but
both have entirely ignored them.        I am now able to repeat them, and
to give them much greater force.         No less than twenty-three out of
the  forty-eight  species of “Challenger”    Actinometra, and three species
in Semper's collection, have more or fewer grooveless arms.              I have
cut sections of    these  arms in two species, and have obtained the
same results as with Act. polymorpha and Act. solaris. The “ventral
nerve” and ambulacral epithelium are conspicuous by their absence,
while the axial cords in the skeleton, which          I also regard as true
nerves, give off branches freely in the centre of each arm-joint, as
I  have already described for other species both of Actinometra and of
Antedon.     Two points are noteworthy. In one species, one of the
posterior ambulacral grooves stops quite abruptly on the disk, some
little way from the arm bases, and the two arms to which it would
naturally have gone with its “nerve,” tentacles, &c., receive no
branches from any of the adjacent grooves to supply the deficiency.
    Lastly, in the gigantic Philippine species already referred to as
No. 37, there are more than one hundred arms, many of which are
grooveless    and “nerveless,” as    I have found by section-cutting.       But
these abnormal arms are not limited to the posterior part of the
body, as is usually the case, for there are several on each radius.
    Evidence of this negative character appears to me to be a serious
objection to the German view that the subepithelial bands constitute
the only nervous apparatus of the Crinoids. Ludwig" attacks Lange's
opinions as to the Asterid-nerves, on the ground that the structures
supposed by Lange to be nerves are not constant, but are absent from
the arms of certain species.        It is curious, however, that Ludwig is
unable to apply this reasoning to his own views respecting the nerves
of the Crinoids!

   In   the course of the following observations upon the typical
characters and the modifications of the pelvis in the Mammalia, it
will be convenient to refer to certain straight lines, which may be
drawn through anatomically definable regions of the pelvis, as aves.

Of these        I
             shall term a longitudinal line traversing the centre of the
sacral vertebrae, the sacral axis (Plate 8, S.a.); a second, drawn along the
ilium, dorso-ventrally, through the middle of the sacral articulation and
the centre of the acetabulum, will be termed the iliac axis (Il. a.); a
third, passing through the junctions of the pubis and ischium above and
below the obturator foramen, will be the obturator axis (Ob. a.); while a
fourth, traversing the union of the ilium, in front with the pubis, and
behind with the ischium, will be the iliopectineal axis (Ip. a.).
    The least modified form of mammalian pelvis is to be seen, as might
be expected,  in the Monotremes, but there is a great difference between
Ornithorhynchus and Echidna in this respect, the former being much
less characteristically mammalian than the latter.
   In Ornithorhynchus (Plate 8, fig. 4), the ilium is remarkably narrow,
and the angle between the iliac and the sacral axis is large, so that the
ilium is but very slightly inclined backwards.        The iliopectineal axis,
nearly at right angles with the iliac axis, is inclined to the sacral axis
at an acute angle; while the obturator axis is nearly perpendicular to the
sacral axis, and the obturator foramen is relatively small.        The front
margin of the cotyloid end of the pelvis sends off a very strong pec
tineal process (p.p.), from the inferior basal part of which a short, obtuse
tuberculum pubis       p.) projects. Between this and the symphysis, the

tween the iliopectineal axis and the sacral axis more and more approaches
a right angle; and that between the sacral axis and the obturator axis
becomes more and more acute. The obturator foramen acquires a much
larger proportional size. The symphysial union becomes restricted to a
greater or less portion of the pubes; or the ventral halves of the
ossa innominata may cease to be directly united, even the pubes being
far apart in the dry skeleton. The metischial processes are represented
by tuberosities, which may extend upwards and unite with anterior
caudal         vertebrae;            and         the       ilia may remain narrow or become

are readily moveable upon their fibro-cartilaginous connexions with the

pubes.   Throughout their whole length they give attachment to a
muscle, which answers to the pectineus and short adductors of the
thigh, while the aponeurosis which lies between them and the ischia
gives origin as usual to the obturator externus; and the obturator
nerves pass out close to the cotyloid ends of the pubes (Plate 8, fig. 12,

each side of the symphysis, I will adopt the name of epipubes, proposed

reduced to a mere slit, often bridged over by a process of the ischiurn.*
The pectineal process is immensely elongated in some Ornithoscelida
(as Hulke has shown in Iguanodon, and Marsh in Laosaurus (Plate 8,
fig. 8)); but, in birds, it is usually short (fig. 9), and may be absent,
and no epipubes have been discovered, either in the Ornithoscelida
or in birds.t
   Thus, it appears to be useless to attempt to seek among any known
Sauropsida for the kind of pelvis which analogy leads us to expect
among those vertebrated animals which immediately preceded the lowest
known Mammalia.      For, if we prolong the series of observed modifica
tions of the pelvis in this group backwards, the “Promammalia ’’
antecedent to the Monotremes may be expected to have the iliac and
obturator axes perpendicular to the sacral axis, and the iliopectineal
axis parallel with it; something, in short, between the pelvis of
an Ornithorhynchus and that of a land tortoise; and provided, like the
former, with large epipubes intermediate in character between those of
the lower mammals and those of crocodiles. In fact, we are led to
the construction of a common type of pelvis, whence    the modifica                  all
tions known         to
                 occur   the Sauropsida and

have diverged.

of the external oblique in the middle line, and lie between the inner

   Unless the like should prove to be the case in the Dicynodonts, it is
in the Mammalia alone that the subsacral portion of the ilium elongates
backwards, carrying with it the pubis and the ischium, between which
a large rounded obturator fontanelle is developed.
   These facts appear to me to point to the conclusion that the Mam
malia have been connected with the Amphibia by some unknown “pro
mammalian ” group, and not by any of the known forms of Sauropsida;
and there is other evidence which tends in the same direction.
  Thus, the Amphibia are the only air-breathing Vertebrata which, like
Mammals, have a dicondylian skull.       It is only in them that the
articular element of the mandibular arch remains cartilaginous;
while the quadrate ossification is small, and the squamosal extends
down over it to the osseous elements of the mandible; thus affording
an easy transition to the mammalian condition of these parts.
   The pectoral arch of the Monotremes is as much amphibian as it is
sauropsidan; the carpus and the tarsus of          Sauropsida, except the all
Chelonia, are modified away from the Urodele type, while those                                                     of
the Mammal are directly reducible      it; and      perhaps worth notice,

shifted     by

1879.]                         Electricity on Colliding Water Drops.                                                         407
    Under moderate electrical influence there is no material change in
the resolution into drops, nor in the subsequent motion of the drops
up to the moment of collision.    The difference begins here. Instead
of rebounding after collision, as the unelectrified drops of clean water
generally or always do, the electrified drops coalesce, and thus the jet
is no longer scattered about. When the electrical influence is more
powerful, the repulsion between the drops is sufficient to prevent
actual contact, and then of course there is no opportunity for amal
gamation.
  These experiments may be repeated with extreme ease and with
hardly any apparatus. The diameter of the jet may be about           inch,                                             5',

stoneware bottle, the other pole being to earth.          If the fingers be
slightly moistened, the body may be thrown into the circuit, appa
rently without diminution of effect. This perhaps ought not to sur
prise us, as in any case the electricity has to traverse several inches
of a fine column of water. On the other hand, it appeared that most
of the electromotive force of the Grove cell was necessary.
    Further experiment showed that even the discharge of a condenser
charged by a single Grove cell was sufficient to determine coalescence.
Two condensers were used successively; one belonging to an in
ductorium by Ladd, the other made by Elliott Brothers, and marked
 “Capacity        Farad.” Sometimes even the “residual charge "sufficed.
    It must be understood that coalescence of the jets would sometimes
occur in a capricious manner, without the action of electricity or
 other apparent cause. I have reason to believe that some, at any rate,
 of these irregularities depended upon a want of cleanness in the
 water.    The addition to the water of a very small quantity of soap
 makes the rebound of the jets impossible.
    The last observation led me to examine the behaviour of a fine
 vertical jet of slightly soapy water; and     I found, as  I had expected,
 that no scattering took place. Under these circumstances the approach of
 a moderately electrified body is without effect, but a more powerful
 influence scatters the drop as usual.      The apparent coherence of a jet
 of water when the orifice is oiled was observed by Fuchs, and appears
 to have been always attributed to a diminution of adhesion between
 the jet and the walls of the orifice.
     Some further details on this subject, and other investigations re
 specting the phenomena of jets, are reserved for another communication,
  which   I hope   soon to be able to present to the Royal Society; but   I
 cannot close without indicating the probable application to meteorology
 of the facts already mentioned.       It is obvious that the formation of
  rain must depend very materially upon the consequences of en
 counters between cloud particles.        If encounters do not lead to con
 tacts, or if contacts result in rebounds, the particles remain of the
  same size as before; but, if the issue be coalescence, the bigger drops
  must rapidly increase in size and be precipitated as rain.     Now, from
  what has appeared above we have every reason to suppose that the
  results of an encounter will be different according to the electrical
  condition of the particles, and we may thus anticipate an explanation
  of the remarkable but hitherto mysterious connexion between rain
  and electrical manifestations.

            SCOTT,   F.R.S., Secretary to the Council of the Meteorologi
            cal Office. Received February 27, 1879.
    In the former communication                                on this subject,                     which      I    had        the
honour of submitting to the Fellows (“Proc. Roy. Soc.,” vol. xxiv,
p. 354), some experiments were described which showed that a
mixture of air and coal-dust of a certain known chemical composition
was not inflammable at ordinary pressure and temperature; and that,
when 0.892 per cent. of fire-damp (by volume), or a greater propor
tion, was added to the same mixture, it became inflammable and
burned freely with a red smoky flame. The general conclusion to
which the second result pointed was also stated in the same place to
be, that, an explosion originated in any way whatever in a dry and
dusty mine, may extend itself to remote parts of the workings, where
the presence of fire-damp was quite unsuspected.
   The wetness or dryness of the workings of a mine depends, other
things being equal, on the temperature of the strata in which they are
situated: for it is obvious that                            if,    on

coal, and rubbish; and this, generally in the case of the timber, and
always in the case of the coal and rubbish, consists of a coating of
coked coal-dust adhering to them superficially, and testifying                  un
mistakably by its presence that coal-dust has actually been playing
the part which is claimed for it by myself and others.
    Following are a few of the details that have become known regard
ing the most recent explosions of importance:
    Pemberton (11th October, 1877).              36 men killed.       Depth 1,005
feet. At page 333 of the           “Reports    of the Inspectors of Mines,” it
is said:—“The Pemberton Colliery had been held up as a model of
engineering, and seemed to be the last place at which a disaster of
this kind was likely to happen.” At page 332 of the same volume,
the following gratuitous explanation of the explosion is given:—“The
effect of a shot blowing out, and which appears to have occurred,
would be to exhaust the face and sides of Rutter's place and Price's
place, and this additional fire-damp rushing out into an atmosphere
already heavily charged, would bring the air in this particular dis
trict up to the explosive point.”
    Blantyre (22nd October, 1877). 207 men killed. Depth of the
workings from 800 to 900 feet. The seam is not very gaseous and
the mine was supposed to be well ventilated.              It was impossible to
say where the explosion began. At page 7 of the official report it is
said:—“The explosion extended throughout miles of the workings
and was of the most violent kind. The gas in a large portion of the
workings had apparently been mixed to a highly explosive state.
The noise at the top of No. 2 shaft is described as having been like a
shot in a sinking pit, and a great volume of smoke and dust came to
the top. On the top of No. 3 shaft the noise was like the bursting of
a steam pipe, or shot in a sinking pit, and was as quickly over, flame
coming out of the shaft mouth.                Flame seems to have extended
through nearly all the working places.” Again, at page 11:—“The
mine being dry and dusty, and the dust being mixed with highly
inflammable splint coal, would help to spread the flame and give force
to the explosion.”        Lastly, at page 206 of the notes of evidence, a
witness     says:—“I desire to make a suggestion.               On one occasion
Mr. Watson (the         manager)    told me that the    mine,  being   a dry one,
 like a desert, the coal-dust would aggravate an explosion.”
    Unity Brook (12th March, 1878). 43 men killed. Depth of the
 workings 792 feet. The workings were examined, and found to be
safe, half an hour before the explosion.          The mine was dry and dusty.
    * It is encouraging to observe that the agency of coal-dust has thus been recog
 nized by some persons connected with mining, although it appears to have entirely
 escaped the notice of every one except Faraday and Lyell, and some of the French
  mining engineers, until after the appearance of my first paper on this subject in
 1876.

through the mine and 100 yards up the shaft. Naked lights were
used and shots were fired.

   Haydock (7th June, 1878). 195* men killed. Depth of the workings
750 feet.  Smoke and dust were ejected from the shafts. The mine
was dry and dusty. It was not possible to say how or where the
explosion had occurred.    Locked safety lamps were used and no shots
were fired in the district where the explosion happened.
    Abercarne (11th September, 1878). 264 men killed. Depth (?).
A flash of flame and a column of black smoke ascended high into
the air above the mouth of the shaft.       The workings were set on
fire.  This mine was well ventilated, and no accumulations of gas of
any consequence were known to exist in    The workings were un

were from 1,500   1,800 feet below the surface; they were very dry and

cent. of fire-damp in the return air, the slightest puff of a local fire
damp explosion, or of a blown-out shot, will raise sufficient dust to
increase the amount of inflammable matter a hundredfold, and produce
all the phenomena that have been observed in this and similar cases.
Locked safety lamps were used, and shots were fired. The cause of
this explosion, like that of the preceding ones, will in all probability
never be ascertained.
   When smoke and soot are produced; or dust is ejected from the
shafts; or the coal, stone, and timber have a charred appearance, due
to a deposit of coked coal-dust on their surface; or, lastly, when large
superficies of the sides of the galleries are found to be on fire imme
diately after the event, we may safely conclude that coal-dust has
played an important, if not a predominant, part in the explosion.       The
manner in which coal-dust     operates in setting   fire to coal and timber
is probably as follows:—The air is travelling rapidly in one direction
along a gallery, throwing a continuous shower of dust, small pieces
of coal, &c., against all surfaces that deflect it or obstruct its course;

and 2  feet long, is filled with fire-damp, of which a certain measured
proportion is afterwards transferred to the interior of the cylinder A
through the india-rubber tube r n. This is done by admitting water
through an india-rubber pipe attached at the point O. At the same
time as the gas is flowing in at the top of the cylinder A, air is ailowed
to escape at the point b near its bottom by taking out a plug for that
purpose.    The plug is put in immediately after the operation is com
pleted.   The amount of fire-damp employed is as near as may be 456
cubic foot.  The cylinder E is refilled with fire-damp by shutting a
stop-cock at n, opening another at m, which is connected with the
fire-damp pipe by means of an india-rubber tube not shown in the
drawing, and lowering the water bucket below the level of the bottom
of the cylinder E. Before the fire-damp is admitted to the interior of
the cylinder A, a paper diaphragm is inserted between its lower end
and the ring to which it is hinged and screwed, so as to isolate it from
the gallery BC.     The explosive mixture in the cylinder A is ignited
by the spark of a powerful magneto-electric machine which Messrs.
Cross Brothers, of Cardiff, most kindly lent to me for the purposes
of these experiments.     The wires pass through the plug at b, and
are  brought  together just inside the cylinder.
   The method of forming an explosive mixture in the cylinder A, will
                                 I
now be sufficiently plain, but will repeat the description of the opera
tions in regular order. When the cylinder is in the position shown
in fig. 4, several sheets of paper are laid over the opening in the top
of the gallery; the cylinder is then raised to an upright position
and fastened by means of the screw. The plug b is opened and
fire-damp is made to flow through the pipe r n, displacing a corre
sponding volume of air which escapes at b. As soon as the requisite
volume of gas has been obtained the cock r is shut and the plug b is
replaced.    The driving wheel D is next made to revolve at the rate of
about   eighty   turns per minute; twenty-five or thirty turns being
found quite sufficient to make a perfect mixture; and, thereafter, a
spark from the magneto-electric machine causes the explosion.
   When there is no coal-dust in the gallery BC, the flame of the
fire-damp explosion does not extend further than from 7 to 9 feet
from the bottom of the cylinder A. It should be understood that the
valve at b is always closed just before the spark is passed.
   When the gallery contains coal-dust, on the other hand, scattered
along its floor, and lying on a few shelves, whose position will be
given immediately, and when it is filled with the return air of the
upcast shaft, the flame of the explosion traverses          its

that  I could  not, by any possibility, get the flame to travel more than
one-half or two-thirds of the former distance, and             I  came to the
conclusion that the initial impulse, which raises the coal-dust,               is
insufficient to overcome the resistance under the altered conditions.
Again,    I  had 60 feet of nearly air-tight pipe prepared, thinking
thereby to prevent the energy of the wave created by the fire-damp
explosion from being dissipated; but here, once more,              I  found that
it was impossible to get the flame to travel to a distance of more than
30 or 40 feet from the origin, and in this case         I  concluded that the
expanded part of the wave extinguished the flame of the coal-dust.
The best results were obtained when the wooden pipes had open seams
along the junction of the boards of which they are formed.
   At the beginning of the present month (March, 1879), Professor
G. G. Stokes, F.R.S., communicated to me the suggestion that if a
weak solution of chloride of calcium were used for watering the road
ways of mines, instead of ordinary water, the deliquescent salt would
tend to retard evaporation, and a smaller quantity of water would
serve the purpose of keeping the workings damp.                 Accordingly,    I
have   begun   an  experiment    with such a solution in a dry mine, but
it is not yet sufficiently advanced to enable me to state any results in
the present paper.
   The temperature of the air current passing along the gallery varied
from 74° F. near the explosion-cylinder to 60° at the end C. The
wooden shelves spoken of above were in sets of three (one above the
other at equal distances) the shelves themselves being about 6 inches
broad.     One set was placed at each of the points x, fig. 6; and a
brick was placed so as to obstruct the passage below the lowest shelf
of the first, third, and fourth sets for the purpose of causing the force
of the explosion to exert itself more powerfully in sweeping the dust
off the shelves and mixing it with the air.
   The arrangements whereby pure air, or pure air and fire-damp,
can be employed, were only completed before the weather became
unsuitable for continuing the experiments, which,         I  need hardly say,
are made in the     open   air.   I obtained sufficient   results,   however, to
show that the absence of even the small proportion of fire-damp
contained in the return air of Llwynypia Colliery, makes a great
difference in the force of the explosion and the distance to which the
flame will travel along the gallery.        I found, also, that when two
per cent. of fire-damp was added to the current of pure air entering
the fan F, even better results were obtained than with the return air
of the mine.
   Although this apparatus appears to be on too small a scale to
solve the coal-dust question unequivocally,     I think the results obtained
with it are sufficiently conclusive to enable us to affirm, that a fire
damp explosion, occurring in a dry coal mine, is liable to be in

definitely extended by the mixture of air and coal-dust produced
by the disturbance which it initiates.
   The dangers due to the presence of coal-dust in dry mines can be
very easily avoided by sprinkling water plentifully on the principal
roadways along which the air currents pass, in going         and coming                              to,

conclusions; secondly, his apparatus did not allow of his experimenting
with two liquids in contact, consequently he could not legitimately
draw any conclusion in this latter case. And although Kohlrausch
had made some few experiments on the difference of potentials of
liquids in contact, still since he employed moist blotting paper surfaces
instead of the surfaces of the liquids themselves, the authors considered
for that reason alone, if for no other, that his results did not carry the
conviction the distinguished position of the experimenter might have
led them to anticipate.
   They therefore designed a method and an apparatus for carrying          it
out, by means of which they could measure the difference of potentials
in volts at each separate contact of dissimilar substances in the
ordinary galvanic cells, from which they could ascertain whether the
algebraical sum of all the contact differences of potential was, or was
not, equal to the electromotive force of the particular cell in question.
From the results they obtained, and which are given in Papers Nos.         I
and II, “Proc. Roy. Soc.,” No. 186, 1878, they concluded within the
limits of their experiments that if AB, BC, CD, &c., were the con
tact differences of potential measured separately of the substances A
in contact with B, B in contact with C, &c., then, any one or more of
the substances being solid or liquid, if any number A, B, C - - - - -    K
were joined together, and the electromotive force of the combination
AK,   measured, the following equation was found       true:—
                  AK=AB+BC+CD+               -- - - - +JK,
which proved that each surface of separation produced its effect inde
pendently of any other.
   Their method by which any single contact difference of poten
tials was measured was as follows:–Let 3 and 4 be two insulated
gilt brass plates connected with the electrodes of a delicate quad
rant electrometer. Let 1 under 3, and 2 under 4 be the surfaces
whose contact difference of potential is to be measured; 3 and 4
are first connected together and then insulated, but remain con
nected with their respective electrometer quadrants.          Now 1 and
2 are made to change places with one another, 1 being now under
4 and 2 under       3,  then the    deflection of the electrometer  needle
 will give a measure of the difference of potentials between 1 and 2;
and in the present paper it is proved that in order that the observed
difference of potentials in the electrometer quadrants shall be pro
portional to the contact difference of potentials desired to be measured,
either there must be perfect symmetry in the induction apparatus
before and after reversal of 1 and 2, a condition very difficult to be
obtained, or else the plates 3 and 4 must, in addition to being connected
together, be also put to earth, or reduced to zero potential, before
each reversal, and also the mean potential of the substance under test

must be kept as low as possible, conditions that were always carefully
observed    in the experiments.
   The apparatus employed by the authors in the present investigation
is then explained in detail, and it is shown how, by improving on their
earlier form, they have removed a difficulty which formerly existed,
and which prevented their previously experimenting on pairs of sub
stances having very different weights, such as a vessel of mercury and
a sheet of metal. The method of making the permanent and temporary
adjustments, the tests for leakage, the experimental mode adopted of
compensating the error arising from defects in parallelism of the
apparatus affecting the results obtained from two rigid surfaces (as
that of copper and zinc) differently from the result found with one or
with two liquid surfaces under test are then described, as well as the
details of a complete experiment and the precautions adopted to obtain
clean metallic surfaces.

investigation have divided themselves into three groups:

must have been introduced by former experimenters using a moist
blotting-paper surface instead of the surface of the liquid itself.
   A large number of discordant results were obtained in March, 1878,
and their explanation led to the interesting result that the apparent
contact difference of potentials between a metal and mercury, as
measured inductively, varied much with small additions of tempera
ture.   The accidental difference of temperature in the different        ex
periments arose from the mercury having been redistilled in the
laboratory between every two experiments to remove all possible traces
of impurities, and probably in some      cases it had not become perfectly
cold before a new    experiment   was made.      The investigation of this
apparent change of contact difference of potentials with temperature
led to a consideration of the contact difference of temperature of
mercury with air, since, of course, in all these inductive experiments
two air contacts arè included in the result.      The results thus obtained
will form part of the substance of the next paper.
   Next follow a number of checks of the accuracy of the results
based on the well   known law that in any compound metallic circuit at
uniform   temperature   there is no electromotive force. This is followed
by some considerations regarding the measurement of the difference of
potentials between substances and the air in contact with them, and       of
measurements of the Peltier effect.
   It has usually been thought that the differences of potential of liquids
in contact with one another were so small as to be almost inappreciable
in comparison with the differences of potential of metals in contact;
but the authors have ascertained, among other results, that strong
sulphuric acid in contact with distilled water, solutions of alum, copper
sulphate, and zinc sulphate has a measured difference of potentials of
1:3 to 1:7 volts, an electromotive force more than twice as high as that
of zinc and copper in contact. And hence the importance of an
apparatus that can directly measure the difference of potentials of two
liquids.

I. “Note on some Spectral Phenomena observed in the Are
   produced by a Siemens' Machine.”        By J. NORMAN
   LOCKYER, F.R.S. Received March 3, 1879.
  In continuation of my work on the spectra of metallic vapours pho
tographed when incandescent in the electric arc,            have recently                    I
employed a Siemens' dynamo-electric machine driven by a gas engine
of ten horse-power, using an effective force of five or six.
  The greatly increased length of arc obtained by      these means has
enabled me to observe and photograph a new set of phenomena of
great beauty, and I think of the highest theoretical importance.
  In my former work with a battery of thirty cells, in order to obtain
the lengths of the lines, it was necessary, in consequence of the short
ness of the arc, to throw an image of a horizontal arc on the vertical
slit of the spectroscope.  In this manner perfectly symmetrical photo
graphs were obtained, the shortest lines due to the core, and the
middle portions of the longest ones proceeding both from the core and
the exterior portion, lying in the axis of the photograph.
  With the Siemens' machine the arc is not only much longer, but                                                     by

  We may say, roughly, that the carbons employed give      a spectrum
containing the  flutings  of carbon and the lines of calcium, some of
them reversed, as            I
                      have shown many years ago, both in the case of
this and other substances.
   In the photographs of the arc taken under the conditions        have                                     I
stated, the calcium lines cling to one pole and the carbon flutings to
the other; the lines which reverse themselves in the case of calcium
being those which have their intensity most pronounced close to the
pole. That this is a phenomenon not dependent upon the chemical
constitution of the two poles, but rather on some electrical separation,
is rendered evident by the fact that on changing the direction of the
current the calcium and carbon spectra change positions.
   Although these phenomena are very marked in the photographic
region, as is evidenced by the photographs which           submit to the                    I
Society, they yet appear more strongly developed in the less refran
gible regions.     The exquisite carbon flutings in the yellow-green,
for instance, cling more closely to the pole than those in the violet.
   So much for the spectrum of the poles themselves.
   If now we introduce a metal and observe vapour, we find per              its                             a
fectly new set     phenomena. We get long and short lines, but the

Photograph  of Mn lengths taken in the old way, showing that with a battery of
            30 Grove cells and a horizontal arc a perfectly symmetrical photograph
            was obtained with the lines extending equally on either side of a hori
            zontal ink line drawn through the axis of the photograph.
Photographs of Ba, Sr, and Mn, giving in each case the spectrum of the core compared
            with that of the flame of the arc.
             I.    Ba, showing that of two lines (wave-length 4130.5 and 4282 5) of
                  equal intensity in the core, the less refrangible was visible almost alone
                  in   the flame.
          II.     Sr, showing two lines at 4078.5 and 4215:3.         In the core the more
                  refrangible has a much broader reversal than the other, while in the
                  flame the less refrangible exists alone and reversed.
          III     and IV. Mn, in the flame-spectrum of one of these photographs the
                  triplet at about 4030-0 exists with no other Mn lines; while it is
                  absent from the flame-spectrum     of the other photograph, although the
             Mn line at 4234.8 is present.
Photograph   of flame-spectrum of Ca taken with an oblique slit, as the flame nearly
             always branches off at an angle.
Spectrum of Rb, showing that the carbon bands cling to the hotter pole, while the
             Ca and Rb lines cling to the opposite pole; one set of carbon bands,
             however, stretches right across the spectrum.
Two  photographs   showing reversal of phenomena by reversing the current.
          I. Two spectra of Pb, obtained by normal current and reversed current,
             showing that the lines which, in the upper spectrum were thickened at
                  their lower extremities, were in the lower spectrum thickened at their
                  upper extremities, and that the general appearance of the two sets of
                  lines was reversed.
          II.
           Two spectra of Cu showing the same phenomena.
Spectrum of Mn obtained with the large arc of a Siemens' machine, in which the
           want of symmetry is so conspicuous that if a straight line be drawn
           through the centre of the photograph it will cut one set of lines at their
           centres, another near their upper extremities, while a third set of lines
           will be cut near their lower extremities.
Photographs showing separation of lines.
         I. Spectrum of Li containing impurity lines of Ca, Sr, Fe, and Mn, the Ca
            and Mn lines clinging to one pole, and the Fe and Sr lines to the other.
          II
           and III. Different parts of Fe spectrum, showing Ca lines starting from
                  one pole, and Fe lines from the other.
          IV.     Spectrum of Cu, showing that this separation can exist not only between
                  two metals, but even between lines of the same metal.   In this the blue
                  Ca line is   seen    thickened at the upper pole, while the H and               K lines
                  were only    seen   at the lower pole.
Spectra of     Ti, Ni,    and Mn, in which the lines were not              all produced     atthe two
                  poles, some occupying    intermediate position;

                  themselves     en   échelon along the spectrum.
Spectra   of   Cu and Ni, showing         the irregular thickening   of   different lines   at   different
                  levels of the arc.
                                                                                   2I   2

Photographs of the spectra of Sr, Cu, and Mg, showing central thickening.
         I. Sr, containing two lines, one Ba showing very little thickening, while
            the other true Sr line exists only at the centre as a broad, fluffly reversed
            line.
            II.   Cu, all the Culines in this photograph have their central portions ex
                  panded, and most of them to a greater extent on the less than on the
                  more refrangible side.   Some of the Fe lines have also their centres ex
            panded, which is not the case with the Ca lines, the Ca lines in the blue
           being developed at their extremities.
           III.
            Mg, showing line in the blue-green, with a central expansion on the less
           refrangible side, giving the line the appearance of a half spindle, b
            being quite normal.
Spectrum of Sn; showing lines of Ca and Fe; the former are expanded at their
                  lower extremities, the Fe lines are not so expanded, but exist at a higher
                  level than the Ca lines. The photograph shows that the line which is
                  basic to Fe and Ca is carried up with the other Fe lines, and is also
                  expanded at            its   lower extremity    with the other      Ca   lines.

more vividly incandescent than the other. Then begins a new set of
phenomena—the absorption of the light of either pole. Generally on
the more incandescent pole the absorption widens for a space, then
narrows and finally puts on a trumpet appearance and is lost, as if
the molecules to which the absorption is due were then, owing to
the reduction of temperature, being reconstructed, thus increasing the
quantity of available absorbing material of this particular kind.
  Very often on the opposite pole the line is seen merely as a bright
one, or again the absorption is reduced to    smallest proportions.   its

conditions of temperature which enable us to observe the reversal
now of this set of lines, now of that, the more complex becomes the
possible origin.  Some spectra are full of doublets: sodium and
potassium, as ordinarily mapped, may be said indeed to consist ex
clusively of doublets; others, again, are full of triplets, the wider
member being sometimes on the more, sometimes on the less, re
frangible side.   Doublets and triplets, as a rule, reverse themselves
more freely than the irregular lines in the same spectrum—which
particular doublet or triplet will reverse depending upon the tem
perature, as if the cooler vapour to which the reversal is due varied
as in the case of fractional distillation. Some lines are clean cut in
their reversal; others, again, to   use the laboratory   phrase, are fluffy   to
a degree that must be seen to be appreciated, so much so, that when
photographed they appear merely as blurs upon the plate.
   The above results, which have been foreshadowed in my previous
papers, have led me to examine especially the intensities of the various
Fraunhofer lines, and to compare the intensities of the metallic lines
confronted with them in arc and sun photographs.              I
                                                         have done this
because it is worse than useless to proceed with this construction of
the large map now that four years' work has shown that the method
of impurity elimination has proved insufficient, until some other
method, embodying a higher law, can be used; and to get this we
want work over the whole field. This examination          I
                                                  am making, not
only from K to G, over which my own photographs extend, but even
to b, by means of another series taken by Professor Roscoe, which he
has allowed me to inspect.
                                I
   In short, in this survey have about 300 photographs to work upon.
I exhibit several of these photographs to the Society in anticipation of
a further communication.
   The upshot of this inquiry even already is as follows:—The dis
crepancy which      I
                    pointed out, six years ago, between the solar and
terrestrial spectra of calcium is not an exceptional, but truly a typical
case.   Variations of the same kind stare us in the face when the
minute anatomy of the spectrum of almost every one of the so-called
elements is studied.      If,
                           therefore, the argument for the existence          of
our terrestrial elements   inextra-terrestrial bodies, including the sun,
is    depend upon the perfect matching
     to                                       of the wave-lengths and         in
tensities of the metallic and Fraunhofer     lines, then we are driven        to
the conclusion that THE ELEMENTS WITH WHICH WE ARE            ACQUAINTED   HERE
DO NOT EXIST IN THE SUN.

   The still existing differences of opinion respecting the botanical
affinities of the Sigillariae give value to every new fact calculated to
throw light upon the question. In 1865, Edward Wunsch, Esq., of

upon    it. He found,       Laggan Bay,

filled up with volcanic ash. These stems failed to display a single
feature, justifying the conclusion that they were Sigillarian.
    In two of them the central cavity, instead of being filled with ash,
was filled with miscellaneous heaps of vegetable matter, amongst
which were large fragments of the vascular axes of various plants,
such as Lepidodendra and Stigmariae, but in one of the largest stems
were five or six decorticated vascular cylinders of Diploxyloid stems,
of the largest size, and which, though arranged parallel to the
long axis of the cylinder which                  enclosed     them, obviously
                                                            did not

             to                                            The sup
position that these had been young stems that had grown within
the hollow protecting cylinders,   from spores, accidentally intro
duced, is wholly untenable, since each one of these several vascular
axes has been the centre of a stem fully as large as that within
which we found them aggregated. Of course, these Diploxyloid
vascular axes had the organization which Brongniart and the younger
school of French botanists which still upholds his views on this
point, believe to be characteristic of true Sigillariae—a conclusion from
which I have long dissented.
  The only fragment              that threw any light upon the character
                                we found,
of the leaf-scars that had indented the surfaces of these fully grown
stems, was a well-defined example of the Lepidodendroid type.
   We directed careful attention to the nature of the smaller fragments
of branches and foliage which abounded in the volcanic ash with
which the large stems were overlaid. These consisted of Lepido
dendroid branches and twigs of all sizes and ages, and no doubt was
left upon my mind that they were really the disjecta membra of the
stems around which they were so profusely scattered. The only fruits
that have been obtained from the same locality are Lepidostrobi, most
of which contain macrospores and microspores. Unless we are prepared
to believe that this Arran deposit contained, on the one hand, numerous
stems without branches, and, on the other, yet more numerous branches
without stems, we must recognise in these specimens the comple
mentary elements of a grove of Lepidodendroid trees.
   One specimen found is a very important one.         It has a mean
diameter of six inches, and is either a small stem or a very large
branch.  Internally it exhibits the same structure as all the smaller
Lepidodendroid branches, except so far as it is modified by size and
age.  But in addition to              its
                               other features, exhibits  very narrow

exogenous ring surrounding                  the ordinary Lepidodendroid           one,   thus
giving some clue           to the size attained          by
                                                    such branches before the

must obviously have gone off the branches—either to ordinary ones or
to pairs of fruit-spikes.
   Myriads of the vegetable fragments both from Oldham and Halifax
are drilled in all directions with rounded insect or worm borings, and
further traces of these xylophagous animals are seen in innumerable
clusters of small Coprolites of various sizes; the size of those com
posing each cluster being uniform.
   Desirous of verifying Count Castracane's alleged discovery of
Diatoms in coal, specimens of twenty-two         examples of coal from
various localities in Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Australia were reduced,
after the Count's method, to a small residue of ash. This work was
done for me in the chemical laboratory of Owens College through the
kindness of Professor Roscoe. Like Mr. F. Kitton, of Norwich, the
Rev. E. O'Meara, of Dublin, and the Rev. G. Davidson, of Logie Cold
stone, I have failed to discover the slightest trace of these organisms
in coal.
   The last objects described are some minute organisms from the Car
boniferous limestones of Rhydmwyn, in Flintshire, and which were
supposed by Professor Judd to have been siliceous Radiolarians from
which the silica had disappeared and been replaced by carbonate of
lime.     I fail to find any confirmation of this conclusion. The objects
appear to me to constitute an altogether new group of calcareous
spherical organisms that may either have been allied to the Foram
nifera, or have had some affinities with the Rhabdoliths and Coccoliths.
I  have proposed for several species of the organisms the generic name
 of Calcisphaera.     Myriads of objects of similar character, but of larger
 size, constitute the greater portion of a Corniferous limestone from
 the Devonian beds of Kelly's Island, U.S.A.

carnivorous as Coelenterates and Turbellarians, especially as the only
recorded experiment, that of Max Schultzet on Vortex viridis, yielded a
totally negative result. Some such hypothesis, however, can hardly

Rhabdocoele Planarian,§ Convoluta Schultzii, O. Schm., crowds of
which, lying at the bottom of the shallow pools left by the retreat
ing tide, resembled at first sight patches of green filamentous algae.
Their abundance in fine weather on the surface of the white sand,
covered only by an inch or two of water apparently to bask in the sun,

favourably situated must have its ordinary vegetable functions.                               I
accordingly returned to Roscoff in the autumn to make experiments.
   The mode of procedure was evidently to expose the Planarians to
sunlight to observe whether any gas was evolved, and if so to analyse
it qualitatively, and quantitatively.  After one or two trials a form of
apparatus—the simplest possible—was found, which answered admir
ably.    It merely consisted of a couple of the round shallow glass
dishes used in the laboratory as small aquaria, the edge of one fitting
as nearly as possible, when inverted, into the bottom of the other.
Into the larger vessel were put Planarians enough to cover the bottom;

  The determination    of the nature of the evolved gas was readily
effected. On transferring the quantity produced in one or two vessels
to a small test-tube, and plunging into it a match with red hot tip,
there was to be seen the white glow characteristic of dilute oxygen.
A large glass tube of tolerably even calibre, about 75 centims. long,
was sealed at one end, and bent at about two-thirds of its length from
that point at an angle of 60°. It was then filled with water, and the
water in the long sealed arm almost entirely replaced by gas at the
pneumatic trough. This comparatively large quantity of gas, about
60 centims. cube, was obtained by exposing a dozen or so of apparatuses
exactly similar to that described, except that bell-jars, sealed funnels,
&c., sometimes replaced the upper flat dish, and white soup plates the
lower.   They were set agoing about noon, and the abundant gas
yielded by thus exposing a surface of nearly a third of a square metre
covered with Planarians was collected at sunset.
  On agitating the gas with a solution of potassic hydrate a barely
appreciable  absorption of carbonic anhydride took place, but on the
addition of pyrogallic acid with renewed agitation, the intense brown
coloration, with rapid and considerable ascent of the fluid in the long
arm of the tube, confirmed the presence of a large percentage of
oxygen.
  The results of many experiments varied from 43 to 52 per cent. of
oxygen; the higher number representing the amount of gas given off
by freshly collected Planarians, and the lower that yielded on the
second or third day of their subjection to experiment.     In order to
judge of the degree of accuracy which                          I
                                           could obtain by this rough
method of analysis, I estimated by it the oxygen of common air, and
obtained 19.9 per cent instead of 209.       Allowing      this loss                    for               of
about 5 per cent,    may   safely
                          it                        be
                                    asserted that the  gas  evolved by
these animals does not contain less than from 45                                   to    55   per 100     of
oxygen.
   The Planarians are little the worse after    24 hours' journey from  a
Roscoff     Paris, and when placed
           to                                 aquarium they instantly

nauseous and uneatable—holds good here. So strong and disagreeable
is the odour, to which the taste doubtless corresponds, that this alone
might be relied upon as a protection against the least fastidious of
fishes or Crustaceans.
   The chemical examination of the animal yields results of interest.
Treated with alcohol, a yellow substance, contained in small elongated
vesicles, aggregations of which are dotted over the integument, dis
solves out very rapidly, yielding a golden solution without definite
spectrum.    This has of course nothing to do with xanthophyll. Con
tinued treatment with alcohol dissolves out the chlorophyll, of which
the magnificent green solution is tolerably permanent.       As former
observers have  shown,  it has a red fluorescence, and gives a spectrum
closely resembling that of vegetable chlorophyll.
   Knowing that these animals decompose carbonic acid, and evolve
oxygen, one naturally enquires whether they do not still more com
pletely resemble green plants in fixing the carbon in the same way.
To answer this question, the residue of the Planarians, coagulated and
decolorised by repeated treatment with alcohol and ether, was boiled
with water, and filtered off. The clear solution gave with iodine solu
tiona deep blue coloration, which disappeared on heating, and reap
peared on cooling, indicating the presence in quantity of ordinary
                                                                  -
vegetable starch.
   To separate and purify this starch on a large scale, some hundred
grammes of Planarians were repeatedly boiled in water. The solution
(which had an intensely alkaline reaction) was treated with four or
five times  its
              bulk   strong alcohol, and allowed
                        of                             stand for some
                                                                to
days.   The flocculent precipitate was collected, decolorised with
ether, and washed with cold water.         great part

leaving the starch behind, and the filtered solution gave with iodine
the red-brown coloration characteristic of dextrine.    To ascertain
whether this dextrine was naturally present,       had merely been pro

was purified by repeated solution and recrystallization                 in absolute
alcohol. With PtCl, it yielded a precipitate, which was kindly analysed
for me by Dr. Magnier de la Source, and found to be the platino
chloride of methylamine: however, it is very probable that the volatile
alkaloid was really more complex, but broke up in the distillation.
The subject would repay the attention of a chemist. Trimethylamine
has been obtained from many animal sources, and the production of
this, or     some   nearly    allied body, in such remarkable          quantity    by
 Convoluta seems to be a protective specialisation.
    The ash of the Convoluta contains iodine, another analogy to the
algae.
    As the Drosera,      Dionaba, &c., which     have attracted so much atten
tion of late      years,  have received the striking name of Carnivorous
 Plants, these Planarians may not unfairly be called Vegetating
Animals, for the one case is the precise reciprocal of the other. Not
 only does the Dionaba imitate the carnivorous animal, and the Con
 woluta the ordinary green plant, but each tends to lose its own normal
 character.     The tiny root of the Drosera and the half-blanched leaves
 of  Pinguicula     are paralleled by the absence of a distinct alimentary
 canal and the abstemious habits of the Planarian.
    It  still remains to ascertain the behaviour of other green animals,
 and   I hope to begin with Hydra and Spongilla,” as soon as the season
 permits.
                                PART II.—Histology.
    The general characters of the animal have been already given by
 Schmidt, and       I  need only add that      I have succeeded in making out
 the mouth, which lies, as usual in this genus, a little way behind the
 otolith. It is not a mere transverse slit, but is surrounded by a lip
 capable of slight protrusion, which evidently corresponds to the pro
 trusible pharynx of higher Planarians. When feeling its way the
 animal has a curious habit of sharply retracting the terminal point of
 the anterior ends of the body, the head thus becoming bilobed, with a
 central depression.        Each lobe becomes a sort of temporary tentacle,
 and these may be compared with the blunt permanent head lobes of
 allied forms. So too the animal “when extremely contracted” throws
 its smooth dorsal integument, not into irregular wrinkles, but into
 rounded papillae, which remind one of the permanent dorsal papillae of
  other Planarians.
    I  will first notice an interesting point in the histology of the ciliated
  ectoderm.      In teased preparations, kept cold, the ciliated cells often
  become    amoeboid,   some of the cilia changing into slender finger-like or
  stout fusiform pseudopodia. These often retain their curvature parallel

  resultant analogy to Dionaa.     (“Quart. Journ. Micro. Sci.,” 1875, p. 51.)

to the unaltered cilia, and       I have even seen the finer pseudopodia con
tracting gently in time with the cilia of the same cell, thus establishing
a complete gradation between the rhythmically contractile cilium and
the amoeboid pseudopodium through what is really a rhythmically con
tractile pseudopodium.          Haeckel and others have accumulated many
instances of the transformation of ciliary movement into amoeboid and
vice versá, but   I  only know of one case in which the passage-form, the
cilium-like pseudopodium, has been actually observed. Lankester,"
speaking of developing spermatozoa of Tubifex, describes “very large
active fusiform masses, exhibiting very rapid movements like a cilium,
and possessing at the same time the character of a pseudopodium.”               It
is important that Lankester's passage-form occurred during the trans
formation of amoeboid movement into ciliary, while            I  find exactly the
 same thing during the reverse change; and it is not improbable that
such ciliary pseudopodia may transitorily occur in many cases.
    Perhaps no animal structure          has received more varied and       contra
 dictory interpretations than the rod-like bodies (Stäbchen, baguettes) of
 the Planarian integument.          “Max Schultze holds them for end-organs
 of nerves, Leuckart and many others for nettle-capsules, Schneider for
 spicula amoris, Keferstein for mucous glands, Graff for more or less
 developed nematocysts.”f            Two distinct kinds of organ exist in
 Convoluta and other Rhabdocoeles, and have been confused under the
 same name; first, the heap of coloured rod-shaped bodies, the original
 “Stabchen” of Max Schultze, which furnish in Convoluta the yellow
 solution already referred to, and, secondly, large and long spindle
 shaped bodies, generally arranged singly, each containing a sharp brittle
 needle, of which the point lies close under the apex of the spindle.
 In a teased preparation they are generally empty, showing the tube in
 which the arrow lay, and with a little granular protoplasm hanging
 round the mouth like the smoke of the explosion. The dart is gene
 rally propelled for some little distance, but sometimes sticks in the
 mouth of the tube.         Graff's view t is certainly the right one, that
 these are offensive weapons, but they are constructed on so distinct a
 plan from those of Coelenterates, that they might better be called
 sagittocysts than nematocysts. True nematocysts have been described
 in some other Planarians.
    Below the epidermis lie the circular and longitudinal muscles, and
 beneath them      comes the layer of chlorophyll-containing         cells. These
 are clear and semi-fluid, more or less irregular in shape, but becoming
 spherical when separated.            The chlorophyll is not collected into
 granules as in the higher plants, nor into drops as in the green
  cells of Vortex viridis, but is diffused throughout the whole pro

toplasm of the cell, which is thus very intensely coloured. One, or
sometimes two, nuclei are present, besides an irregular heap of
granules. It was very difficult to break up the cell completely, and
so liberate the granules, but in one or two fortunate preparations
treated with iodine, the blue coloration assumed by many of these
granules proved that we have here an actual deposit of starch, quite
like that which Sachs has shown to take place within the chlorophyll
granules of the plant. These starch granules are many of them so
minute as to show Brownian movements; the larger are quite
amorphous,   and consequently exhibit no polarisation.

side of the interior of this cavity and parallel to the long axis of the
cell, are a number of distinct transparent homogeneous filaments                                        in
serted above and below into the ordinary granular protoplasm which
constitutes the remainder of the cell. This division of the cell into a
granular and    a fibrillated  portion is similar, as Dr. Malassez
suggested to me, to that which obtains in the developing muscular
cell of a tadpole's tail, and though also somewhat remotely, to the
structure described by Lankester in the heart of Appendicularia.”   In
a teased preparation, some of these cells are easily found in a state
of rapid rhythmical contraction, giving as many as 100—180 energetic
beats per minute.    The form of the cell alters with every pulsation,
shortening and broadening like a contracting muscle. This change
of form is simply impressed upon the cell body by the contraction of
the internal fibres, and does not therefore truly correspond to that
observed in a muscle. Some cells also of extreme curvature (for
hardly any two are quite alike) bend sharply and return with a spring.
The movements soon become slow and inco-ordinate, and waves can
be seen passing along the separate fibres independently of each other.
The movement stops altogether and the cell bursts, but the fibres
resist for some time longer the destructive action of the water.
  I have never  been able to observe any rhythmical contraction, but
at most a feeble quivering within the cell while in the body of the
animal, nor to make out any trace of definite arrangement.        Max
Schultze has described how the   alimentary canal of the  higher  Pla
narians swarms with Opalina, and it is possible that these so singular
structures may be excessively modified parasitic Infusoria. In any
case, the main histological interest lies in the fact that these pulsatile
cells cannot be classified either with ciliary or amoeboid, with plain or
striated muscular cells, but present a distinct type of contractile
structure.
   In   one    of   these bodies, which had come to rest in the characteristic
curved   pear-like form, the nucleus-like body, which is often to be
seen at one side, was distinctly seen to be in motion.   It slowly dived
under the contractile filaments, and moved steadily towards the
opposite side, displacing the fibres slightly as it pushed          way.                          its
When      had reached the middle the cell had

I. “On the Thermal Conductivity of Water.”                          By   J. T. Bot
          TOMLEY, Lecturer in Natural Philosophy and Demonstrator
          in Experimental Physics in the University of Glasgow.
          Communicated by Professor Sir WILLIAM THOMSON, LL.D.,
          F.R.S.    Received March 11, 1879.
                                        (Abstract.)
   The experiments described in this paper were undertaken at the
instance of Sir William Thomson and by a method devised by him.
   The liquid whose thermal conductivity is to be determined is heated
from above, to avoid convection currents. Two methods of heating
have been used.    In one, a horizontal steam chamber is applied at the
top of the water or other liquid; and, steam being continuously passed
through the heating chamber, the surface of the liquid under experi
ment is kept at a very high temperature, and heat is conducted from
above downwards.     In the other method a large quantity of very hot
water is deposited  on the top of a mass of cold water, mixing being
prevented by a simple contrivance; and the heat of this super
incumbent layer is conducted downwards through    -   the colder water
below.
   The experiments have been carried on in very large vessels, or
tanks, in order to avoid disturbance by means of loss of heat at the
sides. It is intended, at the suggestion of Professor Clerk Maxwell,
to observe the loss of heat by the sides under given circumstances,
and to estimate, from results of such experiments, the probable error
due to this loss.
      the experiments three principal thermometers are employed;
     In
together with a fourth, whose object is merely to show when heat
begins to be lost at the bottom of the layer of fluid experimented on.
When this loss commences the experiment is at an end. The other
three thermometers are used thus:—First there is a thermometer
with a bulb 30 centims. long.     It is placed vertically; and     object its
is   to
      show the   average  temperature  from  top   bottom to the layer
                                                                    of          of
fluid bounded           by
                      horizontal planes passing through the top and
bottom      of
            its bulb. The rise              of
                                     this thermometer     any time shows
                                                               in
the  quantity      of
                  heat that has   passed  into the stratum occupied by          it
in  that time. The other two thermometers are placed with their
bulbs horizontal, and one           known distance vertically above the
                                       at   a

other. They indicate the temperatures                            of the layers in which they
are placed.
   Now, if we know the difference of temperatures of two sides of a
stratum of a liquid during any time, and the quantity of heat con
ducted          the stratum during that interval of time, we can
            across
calculate the thermal conductivity of the liquid by means of a well
known formula.
   The result arrived at by the experiments described, is that the
thermal conductivity of water may be taken at from 0022 to 00245
in square centimetres per second.
   Some experiments have been made on the thermal conductivity of
solution of sulphate of zinc, a solution which happened to be con
venient for preliminary trials.       The specific heat of solution of
sulphate of zinc at different densities, which it is necessary to know
for comparison as to thermal conductivity of that liquid with water,
has been determined.
  Experiments are now being carried on on this subject with the
assistance of a grant from the Government Fund of 4,000l.

Belgian chemist, to all of whom the scientific world owe so much, and
to whom       I
           desire to offer my warmest thanks.
   In a paper of this kind it would be superfluous for me to enter into
any of the already published details concerning the existence and
collection of what is known as platinum-dust or mineral.     It is suffi
cient for me to observe that the six metals (of which platinum is the
chief) usually found more or less in association in their native state,
present characteristics of interest beyond their metallurgical utility,
which are, perhaps, worth alluding to en passant.             It      for                      is,
instance,   curious fact that the
              a                     group should consist     three light            of
and three heavy metals, each division being          approximately the    of
same specific gravity—the heavier being (in round figures) just double
the density     the lighter series.
                  of
   Thus we find osmium, iridium, platinum forming the first division,
of  the respective specific gravities      22:43, 22:39, 21:46; whilst
                                                              of
ruthenium, rhodium, and palladium are represented           the figures            by
11:40, 11:36, 11, the average densities    the heavy and light divisions
                                                              of
thus being  respectively 22.43 and 11:25.

baskets such as are used in the manufacture of chlorine gas for holding
the oxide of manganese. When the first charge of acid is sufficiently
saturated, a fresh quantity should be added until no more action is
apparent; at this stage the greater part of the lead will have been
dissolved out together with a portion of any copper, iron, palladium,
or rhodium that may have been present. These metals are subsequently
extracted from the mother-liquors, the nitrate of lead by crystallization,
and the remaining metals by well-known methods.
   The metallie residue now obtained will be found in the state of an
amorphous black powder (a form most suitable for further treatment),
consisting of platinum, lead, and small proportions of the other metals
originally present—the iridium existing as a brilliant crystalline sub
stance insoluble in nitric acid.   After digesting this compound in
weak aqua regia, an immediate dissolution takes place of the platinum
and lead, leaving the iridium still impure, but effecting a complete
separation of the platinum.
   To the chloride of platinum and lead after evaporation is added
sufficient sulphuric acid to effect the precipitation of the whole of the
lead as a sulphate, and the chloride of platinum after dissolution in
distilled water is treated with an excess of chloride of ammonium and
sodium, the excess being necessary in order that the precipitated
yellow double salt may remain in a saturated solution of the pre
cipitant. The whole is then heated to about 80°, and allowed to stand
for some days; the ammonio-chloride of platinum will settle down as
a firm deposit at the bottom of the vessel, whilst if any rhodium, as is
generally the case, is present, the surface liquor will be coloured a
rose tint, occasioned by a combination of the salts of the two metals.
   The precipitate must be repeatedly washed with a saturated solu
tion of chloride of ammonium and subsequently with distilled water
charged with pure hydrochloric acid. This is necessary for its puri
fication.    The small quantity of the double salt which will be taken
up and held in solution is of course recovered afterwards.    Rhodium
may still exist in the washed precipitate, which must therefore not be
reduced to the metallic state until              its

    Further, to carry out the purification, the blue powder (oxide of
iridium) is re-dissolved in aqua regia, evaporated to dryness, re-dis
solved in water, and filtered.
    The dark-coloured solution thus obtained is slowly poured into a
concentrated solution of soda and mixed with hypochlorite of soda,
and should remain as a clear solution without any perceptible pre
cipitate, and subjected in a distilling apparatus to a stream of chlorine
 gas, should not show a trace of ruthenium when hydrochloric acid and
 alcohol are introduced into the receiver.            In this operation the
 chlorine   precipitates  the  greater part of the iridium in a state of blue
 oxide, which after being collected, washed, and dried, is placed in a
 porcelain or glass tube, and subjected to the combined action of
 oxide of carbon and carbonic acid obtained by means of a mixture of
 oxalic with sulphuric acid gently heated.
     The oxide of iridium is reduced by the action of the gas leaving
 the oxide of iron intact, the mass is then heated to redness with
 bi-sulphate of potash (which will take up the iron and any remaining
 trace of rhodium)       and after subjecting it to many washings with
 distilled  water,  the residue is washed with chlorine water to remove
 any trace of gold, and finally with hydrofluoric acid, in order to take
 out any silica which might have been accidentally introduced with
 the alkalies employed or have come off the vessels used.
     The iridium after calcination at a strong heat in a charcoal crucible,
 is melted into an ingot, and after being broken up and boiled in
 hydrochloric acid, to remove any possible trace of iron adhering to it
 through the abrasion in breaking up, should possess if perfectly pure
 a density of 22:39; but, as iridium prepared even with the utmost
 care will still contain minute though almost inappreciable traces of

 have yet attained is 22:38.
                            Alloy of Iridio Platinum.
     This compound metal possesses physical properties of great value,         t.
 forming a beautiful example of the effect of a careful combination of
  the opposite characteristics       of its component parts.       Thus, the
  extreme softness and expansiveness of pure platinum and the brittle
  ness and excessive hardness of pure iridium, produce, by combination
  in judicious proportions, a perfect and homogeneous alloy, possessing
  the necessary mean of these properties to render it suitable for many
  important purposes, amongst others that of the special object to be
  attained to meet the requirements for an unalterable standard melal,
  for which it is peculiarly adapted.
     In the manufacture of the prototype metres and the geodesique
  rules (each 4 metres in length) ordered from my firm by the Comité
  Internationale des Poids et Mesures, the Association Géodésique          In

468           Mr. G. Matthey.               On the Preparation            of  the  [Apr. 3,
ternationale,    and the French Minister of War, I proceeded in the
following manner with the platinum and iridium prepared as described
above.
    Operating upon a charge of 450 ounces of platinum and 55 ounces
              I
of iridium, commenced by melting these metals together and casting
into an ingot of suitable shape, which                       I  then cut into small pieces
with   hydraulic   machinery.       After       re-melting        and retaining in a molten
condition under a       powerful       blast of         oxygen      and common gas for a
considerable time,      I  re-cast and forged at an intense white heat under
a steam   hammer,     the highly polished surfaces of which were cleaned
and polished after each series of blows—when sufficiently reduced it
was passed through bright polished steel rollers, cut into narrow
strips, and again slowly melted in a properly shaped mould, in which
it was allowed to cool.        I  thus obtained a mass of suitable shape for
forging, perfectly solid, homogeneous, free from fissures or air-holes, and
with a bright and clean surface at bottom and sides as at top. At the
first forging a bar was obtained 35 centims. long, 7-5 wide, 2.5 thick,
which weighed—
                 In air . . . . . . . . . .   . . . . . . .  .    15:105 grms.
                 In water at 70°F.             .. .  . . . . .    14.405    ,,
                  Showing a density at zero of                    21:522
A third of    the bar was cut off and the larger portion again forged to
a  length  of 95 centims, width 2:5, thickness 2.0, which weighed—
                  In air . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      10.814 grms.
                  In water at 60°F. . . . . . . . .               10:315    ,
                  Showing a density at zero of                    21.648
This was then passed through highly polished rolls until of a length
of 4,010 centims. 21 millims. in width, and 5 millims. thick, to
which a perfectly rectangular form was subsequently given by draw
ing it through a series of plates, and thus prepared the rule was in a
condition   to receive the beautiful                polish      of which this alloy is sus
ceptible.
    After passing it through             each hole the metal was annealed by
means of a     jet of  gas   and   oxygen         to a heat just below melting point,
and each time throughout after forging, rolling, and drawing was
exposed to the action of melted borax, and boiled in concentrated
hydrochloric acid to remove any possible trace of adherent iron or
other impurity.
    A piece cut from the end and presented to the French Academy of
 Science gave the following results:

excellent results for the last 20 years, employing for the purpose an
alloy prepared as above described. These proved to be so satisfactory
that   Ihave since made others, both round and square, of various
dimensions, as lately shown at the Paris Exhibition.
  Iridio-platinum alloy has now been proved to possess the following
among many advantages for standard rules and weights:—
  It is almost indestructible, has extreme rigidity, especially in the
tube form, and a most beautifully polished surface can be obtained
upon   it;    its

     The general results of my work on this alloy would lead me, there
fore, to make the following recommendations.
     For the manufacture of standard rules to               use an   alloy of not less
 than 85 per cent. platinum and 15 per cent. iridium, adopting the
 tubular form.
     For the standard weights to use an alloy of not less than 80 per
 per cent. platinum and 20 per cent. iridium, adopting the form now
generally made.
    Finally, following the expression of the great French chemist,
M. Dumas,          I   hope by these labours “d'avoir enriché l'outillage

    The experiments described in the following communication were
made with the electric arc, and in lime crucibles,” or in crucibles of a
highly calcareous sandstone, kindly supplied to us by Messrs. Johnson,
Matthey, and Co., as described in our fourth communication on this
subject; but for some of them we used, instead of a galvanic battery,
a magneto-electric machine producing a much more powerful current
and a much longer arc. The experiments with this machine were
made, through the kindness of Dr. Tyndall, at the Royal Institution,
and we are indebted to Messrs. Siemens both for the working of the
machine and for sparing to us the services of a skilled engineer, in
    * In our first paper on this subject, communicated in February, 1878, when re
ferring to the experiments of Lockyer and Roberts (“Proc. Roy. Soc.,” xxiii), we
mentioned that they employed the combined action of a charcoal furnace and an
oxyhydrogen blowpipe, but omitted to mention that they used a lime chamber after the
model of Stas. Referring to fig. 1 in our communication of February 12, 1879, where
 the use of an oxyhydrogen blowpipe in a lime block is represented, we disclaim any
 novelty in the use of lime; the difference between our experiments and theirs con
 sisting in this, that we use the continuous spectrum from the hot walls of our cruci
 ble, instead of an external  independent source of light, as a background against which
 the absorbent action of the vapours is seen, in the same way as we had previously
  used iron tubes, and now use the electric arc.

appear steadily as sharp black lines, when no                  trace of the other lines
of these metals, either dark or bright, can be                 detected.   Dark bands
also frequently appear, with ill-defined edges,                 in the positions of the
well-known bright green and orange bands of    lime.
   In the case of   sodium,  using the chloride,  we have repeatedly
reversed the pair of lines (5687, 5681) next more refrangible than
the D group. In every case the less refrangible of the two was the
first to be seen reversed, and was the more strongly reversed, as has
also been observed by Mr. Lockyer. But our observations on this
pair of lines differ from his in so far as he says that “the double
green line of sodium shows scarcely any trace of absorption when the
lines are visible,” while we have repeatedly seen the reversal as dark
lines appearing on the expanded bright lines; a second pair of faint
bright lines, like ghosts of the first, usually coming out at the same
time on the more refrangible side.
   Using potassium carbonate, besides the violet and red lines which
had been reversed before, we saw the group, wave-lengths 5831,
5802, and 5782,            all
                     reversed, the middle line    the three being the
                                                                of
first  toshow reversal.  Also the lines wave-lengths  6913, 6946, well
reversed, the less refrangible remaining reversed the longer.     Also
the   group,  wave-lengths    5353,  5338,  5319  reversed,  the most
refrangible not being reversed until after the others.    Also the line
wave-length 5112 reversed, while two other lines     this group, waveof
lengths 5095 and 5081, were not seen reversed.
   Using lithium chloride, not only were the red and blue lines,                           as
usual, easily reversed, and the orange line well reversed for     long               a
time, but also the green line was distinctly reversed; the violet line
still unreversed, though broad and expanded. Had this green line
belonged      to   caesium, the two blue lines       ofthat metal which are    easilyso
reversed      could not have failed          to   appear; but there was         no
                                                                            trace          of
them.

                     of                                                the            of

line, wave-length 6677, was not reversed.

which causes the D3 line.”
   Again, in a letter to “Nature,” June, 1872, Young says,                           “I  confes,
I am sorry        that the spectrum of iron shows a bright line coinciden
with 1474 (K); for, all things considered, I cannot think that iron
vapour has anything to do with this line in the spectrum of the corona
and the coincidence has only served to mislead.                       But there are in thi
spectrum many cases of lines belonging to the spectra of differen
metals coinciding, if not absolutely, yet so closely, that no existing
spectroscope can separate them, and                I am disposed to believe that th
close coincidence is not accidental, but probably points to some phy
sical relationship, some similarity of molecular constitution perhaps
between the metals concerned.                .   .   .     So, in the case of the greer
coronal matter, is it not likely that though not iron it may turn ou
to bear some important relation                to that metal?”           In 1876 he prove
that the coronal line 1474 is not actually coincident with the line o
11"On.
   In    the catalogue of bright lines observed by Young at Sherman in
the Rocky Mountains, to which we have directed special attention in
one of our previous communications, it appears that the above-men
tioned lines 1 and 82, along with D, were as persistently present a
hydrogen, the only other line approaching them in frequency of occur
rence being the green coronal line 1474 of Kirchhoff, which wal
present on 90 occasions out of 100.                  It has occurred to us that thes.
four lines may belong to the same substance. An analogy in th
ratio of the wave-lengths of certain groups of lines occurring in diffe
rent metals has been already pointed out by Stoney, Mascart, Salet
Boisbaudran, and Cornu ; and without any special reductions, ol
claims to an exact ratio in whole numbers, the following analogies ar
worthy of note:—

1879.]                         Molecular Physics in High Vacua.                                                  477
   The ratio of the wave-lengths of F to G of hydrogen ((2) to (3) in
the table above) is nearly identical with the ratio of Ds to the coronal
green line ((2) to (3) in table above).
   This near coincidence in the ratios of certain lines of hydrogen,
lithium, and magnesium, substances belonging to the same type, com
bined with a similar ratio in the wave-lengths of the nearly equally
persistent lines of the chromosphere, greatly strengthens the probability
of the assumption that these lines belong to one substance.
   The fact that the two less refrangible rays have no representative in
the Fraunhofer lines, is by no means opposed to their belonging to one
substance, since we know that aluminium behaves in a similar way in
the atmosphere of the sun; and in the total eclipse of 1875 the

to excite phosphorescence.     At a very high exhaustion there are fewer
collisions, and the initial speed of the molecules close to the negative
pole not being thereby reduced, phosphorescence takes place close to
the pole.
  Experiments are described in which                             a pole folded into    corrugations
is used at one end of a tube, the pole at the other end being flat set
obliquely to the axis of the tube, and having a plate of mica in front
pierced with a hole opposite the centre of the pole. The questions which
this apparatus was designed to answer are:—(1.) Will there be two
sets of molecular projections from the corrugated pole when made
negative, one perpendicular to each facet, or will the projection be
perpendicular to the electrode as a whole, i.e., along the axis of the
tube   P    (2.)     Will
                   the molecular rays from the oblique flat pole, when
this is made  negative,  issue through the aperture of the screen along
the axis of the tube, i.e., direct to the positive pole, or will they leave
the pole normal to the surface and strike the glass on its side P
With the corrugated pole experiment shows that at high exhaustions
molecular rays are projected from each facet to the inner surface of
the tube, where they excite phosphorescence, and form portions of
ellipses by the intersection of the planes of molecular rays with the
cylindrical tube.     When the oblique flat pole is made negative, a
stream of molecules shoots from it nearly normal to its surface, and
those which pass through the hole in the plate of mica strike the side
of the tube, forming an oval patch of a green colour.
    The oval patch in this apparatus happens to fall on a portion of the
glass which has previously had its phosphorescence excited by the
molecular discharge from the other corrugated pole. The phospho
rescence from this pole is always more intense than that from the flat
pole, and the glass, after having been excited by the energetic bom
bardment, ceases to respond readily to the more feeble excitement
from the flat pole. The effect, therefore,                           is,
                                               that when the oval spot

at low exhaustions is very feebly positive; as the exhaustion gets
better the positive potential increases, and at a vacuum so good as to
be almost non-conducting, the positive potential of the idle poles is
at its greatest. The result is that an idle pole in the direct line of fire
between the positive and negative poles, and consequently receiving
the full impact of the molecules driven from the negative pole, has a
strong positive potential.
  It isfound that when the shadow of an idle pole is projected on a
phosphorescent screen, the trajectory of the molecules suffers deflection
when the idle pole is suddenly uninsulated by connecting it with earth.
The same result is produced by connecting the idle pole with the
negative wire through a very high resistance, such as a piece of wet
string, instead of connecting it with earth. A tube, which has already
been described in a paper read before the Royal Society on December
5th last, is used to illustrate this deflection. The shadow of an alumi
nium star is    projected   on a  phosphorescent  screen. So long as the
metal star is insulated the shadow remains sharp, but on uninsulating
the star by connecting it with an earth wire the shadow widens out,
forming a tolerably well-defined penumbra outside the original shadow,
which can still be seen unchanged in size and intensity. On removing
the earth connexion         the penumbra     disappears, the umbra remaining
as before.
   It   is also found that the shadow of the star is sharply projected
when     it is    made the positive    pole, the negative       pole remaining          un
changed.
   These experiments are explained by the results just mentioned, that
the idle pole, the shadow of which is cast by the negative pole, has
strong positive potential. The stream of molecules must be assumed
to have negative potential; when they actually strike the idle pole
they are arrested, but those which graze the edge are attracted inwards
by the positive potential and form the umbra. When the idle pole is
connected with earth, its potential would become zero were the dis
 charge to cease; but inasmuch as a constant supply of positive elec
 tricity is kept up from the passage of the current, we must assume that
 the potential of the idle pole is still sufficient to more than neutralize the
 negative charge which the impinging molecules would give                  The    it.

penumbra to increase greatly in size.          Experiments recorded in the
paper already quoted have proved that the velocity of the molecules
is greater as the vacuum gets higher, and consequently the trajectory of
the molecules under deflecting action, whether of a magnet or of an
insulated idle pole, is flatter at high than at low vacua.
   An experiment is next described, having for its object to ascertain
whether two parallel molecular rays from two adjacent negative poles
attract or repel each other. It is considered that if the stream carries
an electric current, attraction should ensue, but if they are simply
streams of similarly electrified bodies, the result would be repulsion.
Experiment proves that the latter alternative happens, lateral repulsion
taking place between two streams moving in the same direction.
   Many experiments are given to illustrate the law of action of
magnets on the molecular stream, but the results are of too compli
cated a character to bear condensation without the diagrams accom
panying the original paper.
   The molecular stream is sufficiently sensitive to show appreciable
deflection by the magnetism of the earth.
   The author, after numerous experiments, has succeeded in obtaining
continuous rotation of the molecular stream under the influence of a
magnet, analogous to the well-known rotation at lower exhaustions.
Comparative experiments are given with a “high vacuum ” tube,
where no luminous gas is visible, but only green phosphorescence on
the surface of the glass, and a “low vacuum ” tube, in which the
induction spark passes in the form of a luminous band of light joining
the two poles. These two tubes are mounted over similar electro
magnets, the direction of discharge being in a line with the axis of
the magnet.     Numerous experiments, the details of which are given
in the paper, show that the law is not the same at high as at low
exhaustions.    At high exhaustions the magnet causes the molecular
rays to rotate in the same direction, whether they are coming towards
 the magnet or going from it; the direction of rotation being entirely
governed by the magnetic pole presented to the stream. The north
pole rotates the molecular discharge in a direct" sense, independent
of the direction in which the induction current passes.        The direction
of rotation   impressed  on the molecules     by a  magnetic pole is opposite
to the direction of the electric current     circulating  round the magnet.
These results offer an additional proof that the stream of molecules
driven from the negative pole in high vacua do not carry an electric
current in the ordinary sense of the term.
   The author, after giving details of experiments in which platinum
and glass are fused in the focus of converging molecular rays projected
from a concave pole, describes observations with the spectroscope,

which show that glass obstinately retains at even a red heat a com
pound of hydrogen—probably water—which is only driven completely
off by actual fusion.
   The permanent deadening of the phosphorescence of glass is shown
by projecting the shadow of a metal cross on the end of a bulb for a
considerable     time.    On suddenly removing the cross, its image
remains visible, bright upon a dark ground.
   One of the most striking of the phenomena attending this research
is the remarkable power which the molecular rays in a high vacuum have
of causing phosphorescence in bodies on which they fall. Substances
known to be phosphorescent under ordinary circumstances shine with
great splendour when subjected to the negative discharge in a high
vacuum.       Thus Becquerel's luminous sulphide of calcium has been
found invaluable in this research for the preparation of phosphorescent
screens whereon to trace the paths and trajectories of the molecules.
It shines with a bright blue-violet light, and when on a surface of
several square inches is sufficient to faintly light a room.
   The only body which the author has yet met with which surpasses
the luminous sulphides, both in brilliancy and variety of colour, is the
diamond.       Most diamonds from South Africa phosphoresce with a
blue   light.   Diamonds     from other localities shine with different
colours, such as bright blue, apricot, pale blue, red, yellowish-green,
orange, and pale green.       One very beautiful diamond in the author's
collection gives almost as much light as a candle when phospho
rescing in a good vacuum.
   Next to the diamond alumina and its compounds are the most
strikingly phosphorescent.       The ruby glows with a rich full red, and
it is of little consequence what degree of colour the stone possesses
naturally, the colour of the phosphorescence is nearly the same in all
cases; chemically prepared and strongly ignited alumina phosphoresces
with as rich a red glow as the ruby. The phosphorescent glow does
not therefore depend on the colouring matter. E. Becquerel" has
shown by experiments with his phosphoroscope, that alumina and
many of its compounds phosphoresce of a red colour after insolation.
   Nothing can be more beautiful than the effect presented by a mass
of rough rubies when glowing in a vacuum; they shine as if they were
red hot, and the illumination effect is almost equal to that of the
diamond under similar circumstances.
   Masses of artificial ruby in crystals, prepared by M. Ch. Feil, behave
in the vacuum like the natural ruby.
   In the spectroscope the alumina glow shows one intense and sharp
red line less refrangible than the line B, and a faint continuous spec
trum ending at about B.        The wave-length of the red line is 6895.

only crystals which give out light are diamond, ruby, emerald,
sapphire, tinstone, and hyacinth.  The light from emerald is crimson,
and is polarised, apparently completely, in a plane perpendicular to the
axis.  Sapphire gives out a bluish-grey and a red light polarised in
a plane perpendicular to the axis.     The ruby light exhibits no marked
distinction in the plane of its polarisation.
   Among positive crystals tinstone glows with a fine yellow light,
polarised in a plane parallel to the axis of the crystal. So far the experi

      When thin the fur can only be scraped off with difficulty, and
 always brings with it numerous fragments of the hair-like processes
 which form the terminations of the filiform papillae.                                           But, when
 thicker, soft, and moist, it can be removed in considerable quantity
 with ease.

486                           Mr. H.   T. Butlin.                      [Apr.        24.
  Microscopical examination of the results of such scraping gives,                  in
nearly every instance, the same results.
  1. Débris of food and bubbles of mucus and saliva.
  2.    Epithelium.
  3. Masses which appear at      first to consist of granular matter, but
which are the gloea of certain     forms of schizomycetes.    When large
and closely packed they are of yellow or      yellowish-brown  colour, but
when smaller and more loosely held together are almost colourless.
They are generally attached to portions of the hair-like processes
which have come away with them, on account of the tenacity with
which they adhere to the processes.        Vertical sections of hardened
tongues show the relation of these masses to the filiform papillae
better than mere scrapings of the surface of the tongue.      The filiform
papillae, instead of exhibiting fine, clean, tapering processes, terminate
in processes which are uneven, tuberculated, or beaded, and blunted at
their ends, owing to the presence of these bodies.            Around the
masses float free  fungi, often exhibiting   very  active movement.    The
relative    proportion   of the three constituents       of fur varies under
certain conditions.   The quantity of débris of food and bubbles is
much   greater during or immediately after eating than during fasting,
although there is no corresponding increase of the fur at such times.
The epithelium is much more abundant in thin fur than in thick fur,
its quantity depending rather upon the vigour with which the tongue
is scraped than upon the amount of fur present.      It can be obtained
in just as  great quantity where no fur is present, provided  the tongue
be  closely  scraped.  The   schizomycetes  are found in   every  case in
which there is fur upon the surface of the tongue, and            I
                                                               have even
found a little of the gloea where no fur was perceptible to the naked
eye.    The quantity of gloea depends roughly upon the quantity of
fur. The position of the gloea corresponds with the position of the
fur. The fur dots the tops of the filiform papillae, and the gloea is
attached to the processes of these papillae.       Fresh scrapings of fur
show this relation of the gloea to the filiform papillae, but vertical
sections of hardened tongues show more than this. They show that
the filiform papillae are the sole seat of the gloea, which does not exist
between the papillae, and seldom upon the fungiform papillae.      Again,
the colour and appearance of the thin grey fur corresponds with the
colour and appearance of the thin grey pellicle which forms upon the
surface of Bacterium-producing fluids, and as the latter becomes
whiter and more opaque as it becomes thicker, so does the fur become
whiter and more opaque with increased thickness. A modification of
colour     is,
            however, frequently produced by the yellow            or
                                                           brownish

surface of the tongue, I cultivated it upon a warm stage. Minute
portions of fur from different tongues were placed in a drop of
aqueous humour, and kept at a temperature of 30° to 33°C.                   Free
growth and development took place, but instead of the single fungus
I had expected several fungi were found. Only two forms, however,
were present in every instance, namely, Micrococcus and Bacillus, and,
from a comparison of the natural fur with results obtained by
artificial cultivation, I think there can be little doubt that the fur
consists chiefly or essentially of these two fungi.
    Micrococcus existed in every case examined, small spherical bodies
generally in pairs or groups of four, but often forming chains. Upon
the warm stage rapid multiplication took place with the production of
pairs, fours, long and short chains often twisted and looped, and small
and large colonies. When these colonies reached a large size (which
happened in the course of a few hours) they presented a granular
appearance and assumed a yellow or brownish-yellow colour, and all
 movement ceased in them.” The development of Micrococcus occurred
 abundantly and rapidly in all the experiments made with the exception
 of one, in which so rapid a formation of Bacterium termo took place,
 that in the course of a few hours the whole of the fluid was clouded
 and obscured by its presence.           Usually the development of other
 fungi did not interfere with that of Micrococcus.              Comparing the
 masses or colonies produced by cultivation with the granular masses of
 which the fur chiefly consists, the chief constituent of each appears to
 be the Micrococcus sphere.        The natural colonies are, of course, not
 often so pure as those produced artificially, but still not uncommonly
 these natural colonies present the same regularity of structure as the
 colonies figured in sketch 5.
     The other form, Bacillus, was also present in every case examined,
 but unfortunately development seldom or never occurred, being
 apparently prevented by the presence of other fungi. It consisted of
 slender rods, having a well-marked double contour and a light interior.
 Their length varied much, but was always many times their breadth.
 There were no defined contents within the rods, except in some of the
 longer and broader of them, which contained highly refractive
 spherical bodies which appeared to be spores. The shorter rods
 moved    actively about the field of the microscope, and even some of
 the  longer  rods (looking when magnified 450 times from # inch to
 1 inch long) moved slowly from place to place.                 The rods were
 generally straight, but some of the longer ones were curved or bent.
 They often formed short chains or occurred in pairs, but did not form
 colonies, although they sometimes occurred in great number and of
 large size in the Micrococcus colonies.            They showed very little
    * I never observed any lengthening into rods, or the development of any other
 form from these Micrococci.

 change     in appearance for many hours, sometimes for two or more
 days, after which they usually became granular and degenerated.
 These bodies are apparently identical with the Leptothrix buccalis          of
 Robin.       But  I think they would be more rightly called Bacillus
 subtilis.    Their  length,    their slender form, the conditions in which
 they occur, and the fact of their non-development in the presence          of
 other fungi point to this conclusion.           I  made many attempts      to
separate them in order to produce the fungus in a purer form by
cultivation, but did not succeed in doing so. Although this fungus
 did not develop under artificial conditions in the presence of
 Micrococcus and other fungi it is highly, probable that its development
 takes place freely upon the surface of the tongue.               Its habitual
 presence there, generally in tolerable abundance, and the occurrence
of spore-bearing filaments may be adduced as evidence in favour of
this view.
     Besides these fungi Bacterium termo existed in some of the furs
examined, and twice developed with such rapidity that the whole of
the fluid was crowded with these organisms to the exclusion of every
other form.      Pairs, chains, and colonies were formed.
    Sarcina ventriculi    was frequently present and generally developed
quickly.      It  usually occurred in pairs or fours, and was easily
recognisable by its large size, compared with the other organisms
present, by the square or oblong form of its nuclei, by their faint
yellow or red tint, and by the area of protoplasm surrounding the
nuclei. The groups of two or four moved slowly about the field of
the microscope, but the large masses which were formed remained
quite motionless. The masses attained so large a size as seriously to
interfere with the growth of some of the other organisms, and when
large showed a decided yellow, or brownish-yellow colour.
     In two or three of the specimens there occurred rapid and very
abundant development of a form of Spirillum, which appeared from
the double twist which        it  exhibited, and from its extreme tenuity, to
be Spirochoeta      plicatilis.   Its growth took place from exceedingly
small portions of the organism, and continued only at one end, which
was in constant motion, whilst the other end remained stationary;
and as the growth progressed, large masses were formed which soon
became so dense that it was impossible to discern the nature of the
organism of which they were composed.               This Spirochaeta did not
occur in most of the specimens examined.
   A   larger form of Spirillum was also occasionally present, but was
not seen in the act of developing.
   Although I believe the fur consists chiefly of Micrococcus and Bacillus
subtilis,  I think it is probable from the results obtained in the experi
ments upon which the foregoing observations are founded, that the
development      of these other forms (Bacterium        termo, Sarcina ventri

492    Dr.   J.   B. Hicks.   On the Supplementary   Forces    [Apr. 24,
the button in the centre attached to the tambour fairly touching the
abdominal wall.    On revolving the drum attached, a well marked
tracing is obtained, showing the respiratory wave; more marked in
the male, but almost always well pronounced in the female.      The
height of these waves, of course, marks the difference of the elevation
of the centre of the area and the circle described by the three legs
before mentioned, the amount indeed of the bulging of that portion.
By this arrangement the effects of the various movements of the body
can be also registered with great ease, so far as these movements
compress the walls of the abdominal cavity.
  But although the abdominal walls in front yield, yet the descent of
the diaphragm, which accompanies the inspiratory act, must put
pressure on the contents of the abdomen: and thus tension is created,
which is in a certain degree lessened—1st, by the yielding of the walls
just mentioned, and, 2ndly, by the escape of blood from the vessels
within the cavity of the abdomen; and this would be more marked in
the case of the venous blood.           -
  In  the case of the arterial blood, the pressure would tend both up
wards and towards the heart, and downwards towards the lower ex
tremities and the abdominal walls. The movement towards the thorax
would probably be but slight, yet it would to a certain extent add
somewhat to the arterial tension, noticed as commencing at the be
ginning of inspiration. The other, the downward movement, acting
in the direction of the arterial current, would increase also the arterial
tension in the lower extremities and abdominal walls.      But upon the
venous  system the effect would  be greater.
   1st. Upon the systemic its effects would be cut off in the downward
direction by the valves, though this would tend to increase the venous
tension in the lower extremities.      But this probably would be soon
neutralized, or nearly so, by the freedom which the incipient vacuum
caused by the expansion of the chest gives the blood to enter the
heart.   But the pressure caused by the descent of the diaphragm
tends to press the blood in the vena cava also upwards, thus facili
tating the flow in the natural direction; but any tension to which the
vessel is subjected is probably immediately or simultaneously relieved
by the suction-action of the chest, which is well known to diminish
considerably the blood-pressure in the large veins close to the thorax
during the inspiratory movements.     That this pressure of the dia
phragm on the abdominal contents nearly if not quite balances the
suction-action, is shown by the fact that in the sciatic vein the
diminution of the blood-pressure during inspiration is not observed.
  2nd. The portal system is subjected likewise to pressure, and its
contained blood would tend to both        incipient and terminal capil
                                         its
laries; and the resultant would    be   facilitate its movement towards
                                        to
the area of least resistance, namely, towards the haepatic veins.

1879.]       concerned in the Abdominal      Circulation in Man.        493
    In computing the effect of the descent of the diaphragm we must
always bear in mind the effect of the expansion of the lower part or
base of the thorax; for this by lifting off as it were the pressure of
the abdominal muscles attached to it from the viscera beneath, lessens
the effect of the descent of the diaphragm.            Notwithstanding this
there is a notable residuum of force.
    The effect of expiration    on the abdominal   circulation would be pro
bably to gradually permit a restitution of the balance interfered with.
The elasticity of the walls would sustain, to a considerable degree, the
pressure; the portal vein and vena cava would gradually accumulate
 blood, and this in coincidence with an increment in that of the superior
 cava and right cavities of the heart till the irritation of its presence
 causes another inspiratory act.
     It  may be noticed that the tension of the arterial pulse would
 be   naturally   increased during the expansion of the lungs, because
 of the greater supply of blood to the left half of the heart shortly after
 the commencement of the inspiration, and thus the resistance to the
 flow of venous blood through the lung capillaries is lessened; and this
 action it is impossible to ignore when we are discussing the effect of
 the incipient vacuum on the venous blood-pressure during inspiration.
     The same method of registering the effect of the respiratory move
 ments on the abdomen also is applicable to marking the effects of the
 general movements of the body. The elevation of the arm or the leg,
 coughing and laughing, &c., are easily seen to compress the abdomen.
     It would be beside the intention of this note to discuss the manner
 in which this effect of movements of the body is produced; but may   I
 point out that in the act of coughing and laughing we have, as indeed
 might be expected, evidence not only of high pressure (shown by the
 sudden elevation of the wave), but also a tendency to vacuum, as
 illustrated by the sudden descent of the wave below the line.
     These actions must tell violently on the blood-current of the abdo
 men, and tend to force it out of this cavity; and, as before remarked,
 the resultant of this must be to facilitate the current in its normal
 direction.    The same effect must be produced on the other fluids in
 the   abdomen,   and must assist the movement of the secretions contained
 in the ducts of the various organs, notably that of the liver.

     In  the foregoing    note no calculation   has been    made as to the
 amount     of the forces produced by the descent of the diaphragm in
 ordinary respiration.      Its extreme violent action has been calculated
 by Professor Haughton at 20 lbs. on the square inch; but the amount
 of pressure on the contents of the abdomen must vary much, accord

resistance is at the lowest, consequently the effect of descent of the
diaphragm    on the circulation is but slight, compared with that
state which obtains when the parietes are in a high state of health,
and the intestines are fully distended with gas, &c.
   It must be evident that the amount of blood contained in the
vessels within the abdomen must vary much, according to the tension
of the parietes; but this matter does not belong to the subject of this
note.

generally admitted that both in the large sinuses in the walls of the

very slow, that           is,

that area. If it were not so, and but the pushing forward of the mass,
no difference would exist, and, consequently, no reading obtained.
And this is proved by observing the effect on the readings when the
uterine contractions occur, to which           I  alluded at the commencement
of this    note;   for,  when these       supervene,      we find the respiratory
readings reduced almost to nothing, and, instead of the high elevation
waves of the tracing, well shown before, the line is nearly level.
Thus, when the uterus, in consequence of the increased firmness of its
walls, cannot be impressed nor can bulge, we have the effect of the
descent of the diaphragm to a similar extent reduced. This being
admitted,   it is clear that every respiratory action          causes  a movement
of the fluids contained within the uterus, thus assisting the circulation
in a part apparently removed from the maternal cardiac impetus. It
may be worthy of notice, that at the earlier period of pregnancy, the
uterine walls are less yielding, and, therefore, less influenced by the
respiratory act, but then the assistance this renders at a later period is
not so much required, because neither are the sinuses so large nor              the
decidual processes with their sinuses so deep, nor the thickness of             the
placenta so great.        Gradually as the uterus increases, its walls          are
more   yielding    and the force of the respiratory movement more               felt
within.

The effects of Uterine Contractions during Pregnancy in reducing the height of the
    Respiratory Wave is seen by comparing the first line with the last. This tracing
    was taken with a smaller instrument.
    There are other points of interest in this registration of the
 respiratory movements of the abdomen, which do not belong to the
 subject under consideration, and are, therefore, omitted here.
    But there are other accessory forces to be noticed which act on the
 surface of the pregnant uterus, tending to the movement of the fluids
 within; namely, the muscular movements of the body, tending to
 cause a change        of shape of the thorax or abdomen.                These are
 quickly shown by the same arrangements as that by which the
 ordinary respiration is shown. The elevation of the arm, a hoist of
 the body, and, in particular, coughing, show a much greater force than
 is exerted by inspiration.       Hence, one might fairly infer that exercise

                                                            I
   On the 19th March of last year, presented to the Royal Society a
short summary of an inquiry on the function of respiration at various
altitudes in the Alps. The principal result obtained was that a greater
quantity of carbonic acid was formed in the body and exhaled at the
higher than at the lower stations.    Thus, after experimenting on a
spot near the Lake of Geneva, at an altitude of 1,230 feet, and at the
summit of the Breithorn, at an altitude of 13,688 feet, there was
found to be an excess of 15 per cent, for the carbonic acid expired at
the highest station.                   I
                        had come to the conclusion that the increased
formation of carbonic acid in the body at certain altitudes in the
Alps appeared necessary, as a means of resisting the influence of cold
which is occasionally very great in high Alpine regions.
   The question which now offered itself for inquiry was whether, on
rising to a considerable altitude above the sea in a warm climate,

there would be, as had found in the Alps, an increase of the carbonic
acid   expired.         After some consideration,                    the Peak of Teneriffe,
                                                                        in
north latitude 28°, was selected as the place best calculated for investi
gating the subject. The advantages of this site were manifold.      First,
a mean temperature in the day time, which proved to be not lower
than 64° in the shade, could be secured at an altitude above 10,000
feet; next as the mountain rose from the sea, various stations,
beginning at the seaside, might be selected; then fine weather could
be relied upon in June and July, on the Island of Teneriffe; finally,
the spot was situated at an accessible distance from England.
   It took me three weeks to collect the necessary instruments, among
which was a wooden shed, taking to pieces and made to pack in a
comparatively small space. It consisted of six deal boards constructed
so as to     fit
               side           by
                       side with overlaping edges; when mounted, they
formed  a  flat square roof. The four corners         this roof were supof
ported   by  four poles held upright                            by
                                            tent ropes and pegs; broad
strips  ofcanvas were mailed          two opposite    to

there were    a number of empty bottles of the same size,          The bottles
holding the alkaline solution were carefully corked and the corks
sealed with paraffin.       I must also allude to two strong deal boards
or rocking-boards, 6 feet in length and supplied with two iron sockets
midway between the two ends; the sockets fitted upon an iron bar
raised a few inches high on a firm wooden stand. Two square open
wooden boxes were made to fasten at one end of each board respec
tively, and could be filled with stones or sand up to a given weight.
The use of these boards will      be explained    in the course of the present
communication.
    In addition   to the above apparatus    I carried with me a balance and
everything required for determining the moisture expired from the
lungs. My experimental baggage used in the Alps was also included,
 together with every requisite for camping out on the Peak for about
three weeks.
    My Chamounix guide, Edouard Cupelin, who has accompanied me
 for the last ten years in the Alps, and is thoroughly used to the mani
 pulations connected with my experiments, came out with me to
 Teneriffe. He not only assisted me most effectually, but also sub
 mitted himself to experiment.
    We arrived at the Island of Teneriffe on the 25th of June last, and
 after landing at Santa Cruz, proceeded at once to Puerto de Orotava,
 at the foot of the Peak. Three principal stations were selected, two
 at different altitudes on the Peak, and one at the seaside; while from
 the highest station instruments could be carried to the foot of the
 terminal cone, and also to the summit of the Peak 12,200 feet above
 the sea, where I proposed making a few experiments.
    We remained eleven days at the lowest station on the Peak, at an
 altitude of 7,090 feet, and ten days at the higher station 10,700 feet
above the sea.
    The characters of the stations bearing on my experiments were:—
    1. The topographical position and atmospheric pressure.
     2. The temperature of the air.
     3. The hygrometric state of the atmosphere.
     1st. The position and atmospheric   pressure.   My lowest station on the
  Peak, that of Guajara, was situated on a sandy plateau at the foot of
 Mount Guajara, known from Professor Piazzi Smyth having esta
 blished an astronomical station at the summit in 1856.            The moun
 tain rose 1,800 feet above my station in the S.W., while in the
 opposite direction for 200 or 300 yards, there spread a patch of white
 sand mixed with clay, and baked by the sun.            Beyond that could be
 seen a bank of blocks of lava tumbled over each other, which formed
 the edge of an upper undulating level reaching the foot of the actual
  Peak at a distance of two or three miles. The heat of the sun at

502       Dr. W. Marcet               on the      Function    of Respiration   at    [Apr. 24,
  The air from the lungs was expired into a strong india-rubber bag
of a known capacity under a pressure of one inch of water. The
bag used in nearly every experiment sitting held 39.3 litres of air under
that pressure; and in the experiments made while engaged with a
measured amount of muscular work, a bag holding 68.4 litres of air
under the same pressure was employed.
   The tube into which the expired air was drawn for analysis was
supplied with the india-rubber diverticulum described in my former
communication,    and I made occasional use of it to take out small
quantities of air and test them with a solution of barium hydrate.      I
thus observed that a continued agitation of five minutes sufficed for
the entire combination of the carbonic acid.    In every experiment the
agitation was continued for six or seven minutes or longer, by the
watch.    The bottles, into which the fluid was drawn after agitation,
were   well corked, and their necks dipped into melted paraffin.
Although large enough for somewhat more than the bulk of the fluid
they contained, the empty space was too small for the air it held to
affect the alkaline solution.
   My Chamounix guide was practised in the mode of breathing into
                       I
the bag, so that could rely upon his doing this in a perfectly natural
way, and without the loss of any of the air expired; he was also in
the habit of counting his expirations while so engaged.
   We assisted each other mutually; one of us keeping an eye on the
stop-watch              bag, while the other was breathing
                    and the                                         into                           it.

chest, have a height in boots with moderately thick soles of 5 feet
7# inches, and weigh 70 kilog., say 11 stone. We are both in the
enjoyment of very good health.
    It will be observed that we lived precisely in the same way, were
exposed to the same kind of atmospheric influence, and ate the same
kind of food, although from the weight of his body, the guide con
sumed more than I did. The amounts of carbonic acid we expired
could therefore be fairly compared with one another.
    The mean weight of carbonic acid expired from sixty experiments
for myself, and fifty-five for the guide, both sitting, and at the
same stations respectively, was in my case, 472 mgms. per minute,
and in that of the guide 604 mgms., or on 100 kilos. weight of
my body,     I expired 674 mgms. of carbonic acid per minute, and the
guide also on 100 kilos. weight, 679 mgms.                 Thus it was found that
 we both gave out at the lungs an amount of carbonic acid propor
 tional to the weight of our body. This is an interesting, though not
 unexpected result, which appears to me to give much weight to the
correctness of the investigation, and consequently to the reliability of
the conclusions.
    Another circumstance in connexion with the present work still
more deserving of notice than the former, was the fact that while we
 were engaged raising at each step a weight of 39.5 lbs. with the feet,
on rocking boards, at the rate of 45 steps per minute, as will be sub
sequently described, a mean amount of carbonic acid was expired by
each of us respectively, again proportional to the weight of our body.
In these experiments, the mean weight of carbonic acid obtained for
myself from eighteen experiments, six at three different stations, was
1.011 grims. per minute, and for the guide from the same number of
experiments at the same stations 1:269 grms, giving for myself for
100 kilos. of body, 1.444 grnms, and for the guide for 100 kilos. of
body 1:426. Nothing can be more conclusive; we again produced
within our bodies as nearly as possible the same amount of carbonic
acid proportionally with our weight.               These figures also show that
the method     adopted    was well calculated to give reliable results, while
engaged in a definite amount of muscular exercise.
         Amount of Carbonic Acid expired at the different Stations.
     The mean amount of carbonic acid expired at the several stations
by both of us in the sitting posture, was found, to a great extent, to
be influenced in a similar way by the food taken.               In both cases, with
but one exception, the greatest amount of carbonic acid expired was
during the first or second hour after eating, and the quantity
diminished as time elapsed from the last meal taken.” The exception
   * Dr. Edward Smith's (“Phil. Trans,”      1859)  experiments  show that a minimum
amount of carbonic acid expired is obtained while fasting, beyond     which continued
fasting, within certain limits, produces no further reduction.

504       Dr. W. Marcet on the Function of Respiration at                            [Apr. 24,
refers to the guide at Puerto, where his maximum                              is found to be
during the third hour after a meal. The fluctuations in my case may
be said to follow closely those formerly reported from my experiments
in the Alps.
    The subjoined table shows at a glance the variation of the mean
amount of carbonic acid expired during each successive hour after
food, the fifth or sixth hour being grouped together for want of a
sufficient number of experiments.

   The figures between brackets refer to the number of experiments.                 One experi
ment, at 5.48 A.M. at Guajara, not included.
    If the figures reported in this table be taken into consideration
together with the corresponding results obtained in the Alps, it will
appear that the maximum amount of carbonic acid is expired rather
earlier after a meal on the mountains than in the plains, which would
show that there is apparently a tendency to a more rapid digestion
and assimilation of food in the mountains than near the sea level.
    As in the       case of my former investigation,                  I  have neutralised as
much as       possible         the influence of food on the results of the experi
ments, by conducting the inquiry at all times of the day between
breakfast and bedtime.
    Influence of Temperature on the Carbonic Acid expired.—So far, to my
knowledge, the only series of observations we possess on the influence
 of tropical climates on the functions of the human body, are those of
 Dr. Rattray, Surgeon R.N., who has clearly taken great pains to
 investigate the subject; he concludes that:—
     “The three marked tropical phenomena, viz., diminished lung

1879.]         Various Altitudes on the Island and Peak                                         of   Teneriffe.      505
vascularity, slower respiration, and gentler breathing are closely
related, and together indicate reduced lung work, the reverse for the
temperate zone marking an increased function,” &c.”
   Dr. Rattray infers, without apparently making any actual deter
mination of carbonic acid in the air expired, that there is a larger
amount of carbon thrown out by the lungs in temperate than in
tropical climates. The consideration of the mechanical action of heat,
with reference to the functions of the body, had led me long ago to
adopt the same views; and previous to my Teneriffe experiment,                                                          I
had believed that where the heat of the sun was in excess, less heat
was required to be manufactured by the body for the due performance
of its functions, and, consequently, less carbonic acid was formed and
given out.           I
              am now compelled, however, to alter this view, and to
conclude that more carbonic acid is formed in the body under a
tropical or nearly tropical sun than under temperate latitudes.
   In order to make the subject perfectly clear, have placed, in a tabu                 I
lar form, the figures showing the amount of carbonic acid expired, as
found by direct experiments both in my Alpine and southern stations.

506     Dr. W. Marcet on     the  Function of Respiration at      [Apr. 24,
   It will be observed in this table, that, in my case, when approxi
mately equal altitudes in the Alps and on the Peak of Teneriffe are
compared as to their influence on respiration, at the highest stations
there is an increase of carbonic acid expired by 13.8 per cent. for
Teneriffe; at the stations next in altitude, the increase is by 9.6 per
cent. for Teneriffe, and at the seaside, compared with the shores of
the Lake of Geneva, the enormous increase for Teneriffe of 18.7 per
cent. is noted.     As to my guide,       I   have, unfortunately, but few
experiments on the carbonic acid he expires on the Alps, which only
amount to four in number.          They show for approximately equal
altitudes no increase of carbonic acid expired on the Peak of
Teneriffe; but at Puerto de Orotava     I  find him to give out a very large
quantity of carbonic acid in excess of that he expired in the Alps,
amounting to as much as 17.5 per cent. There are no determinations
of the carbonic acid expired by the guide at the altitude of Geneva,
to compare with those obtained at the seaside on the Island of
Teneriffe, but the increase at Teneriffe is greatly beyond any result
that might have been expected at the lowest northern station.
   If my excess of carbonic acid expired on the Peak of Teneriffe,
over the amount expired in the higher Alps amounts to 13.8 per cent,
while there is no increase in the case of the guide, this is probably
owing to the guide apparently perspiring much more freely than         I do,
and to the circumstance that his home is in the mountains, while       I am
accustomed to a residence at the sea level.
   This fact, that an excess of carbonic acid is expired in hot climates
over that given out in temperate zones, is to me so unexpected, and,
indeed, so different from what might have been anticipated, that           I
feel bound to give every possible proof of the accuracy of my work.
   An objection might be raised to the correctness of the analysis from
changes occurring in the normal solution of barium from the action
of the carbonic acid of the air. This was carefully guarded against;
the whole contents of one small bottle were used for each analysis,
thus avoiding the necessary introduction of air in opening the bottle
had the stock of the alkaline solution been carried in a single large
flask.   The normal solution was seen to be perfectly clear when
poured into the 100 cub. centim. pipette, although it had travelled
all the way from London to Teneriffe, and been carried on mule-back
to near the summit of the Peak.       But a circumstance still more con
vincing of    the satisfactory   state of the solution of barium was
derived from the examination of a bottle of this solution, which had
accidentally escaped being used at Teneriffe, and was found after my
return on unpacking the basket. The solution in this bottle exhibited
a small number of white specks at the bottom, there were so few that
on shaking the solution looked clear; on standing the specks re
appeared.   I subjected this fluid to a careful analysis. 25 cub. centims.

mixed with 100 cub. centims. of distilled water gave, in order to
neutralize 5 cub. centims. of the oxalic acid solution, 9:00 cub.
centims. as the mean of six determinations.      My normal solution of
barium, analysed in London before leaving for Teneriffe, had yielded
8-92 cub. centims.; the difference was only by 0.08 cub. centim. This
result would give a very slight deficiency of carbonic acid, but the
error might be expected to correct itself in a number of experiments.
   Finally, it might be objected that, in my Alpine experiment, a loss
of carbonic acid had been experienced from the india-rubber bag into
which the   expired  air was collected. In these experiments a certain
time elapsed after filling the bag previous to the air it contained
being introduced into the tube; this lapse of time ranged between a
few minutes and thirty-five or forty minutes, and was required to
allow the air in the bag to cool down to the temperature of the water
in the tube. No doubt, after a certain time, an escape of carbonic
acid might be expected to take place through the substance of the
india-rubber bag, but no such escape, in any appreciable degree, could
have occurred during the above-mentioned period. This I determined
experimentally  by subjecting a sample of expired air to analysis
immediately after filling the bag, and another sample of the air from
the same bag some time later. The results from four analyses made at
Cannes             in February (1879) were as follows:–

508        Dr. W. Marcet on        the   Function   of Respiration at       [Apr. 24,
    It  is known, from Dr. Rattray's important researches, alluded to
above, that the body loses weight by a change from a temperate to a
tropical climate, and recovers its weight on returning into a colder
latitude, the loss appearing independent of the amount of food taken.
This falling off in the substance of the body, attended, as                    I  have
shown, by an increased formation and expiration of carbonic                       acid,
must be due to increased combustion or excessive oxidation.
     It  is difficult to offer a theory to explain this phenomenon in our
present knowledge of the action of heat on the living body.                   Cold we
know to increase the amount of carbonic acid formed in the body,
 the object of which is clearly to keep up animal heat to its normal
 standard; it is odd indeed that an increase of external heat should
exert a similar influence.          I  do not think it necessary to do more than
allude to a       tendency    to looseness of the bowels        I  had while on the
Island of Teneriffe, which           I  ascribe to the heat of the climate; the
 guide     informs me there was an opposite disposition with him at
 Puerto, on the seaside.          These minor circumstances interfered in no
 way with our health, which was quite good, and our work was con
 tinued nearly daily, and all day long, during our stay at Teneriffe.
     The following table gives the result, in a condensed form, of the
 whole of my inquiry on respiration at Teneriffe, in the sitting posture.
 (See p. 509.)
     The chronological order of my visits to the several stations was—
     1. Guajara.
     2. Alta Vista.
     3. Foot of Cone.
     4.   Puerto de Orotava (seaside).
     The number of experiments made sitting amount, for myself, to 65,
 for the guide to 55, making altogether 120, and, in each of them, a
 sample of air expired during from four to six minutes was analysed.
 The titrations were subsequently all made by myself near Geneva, in
 the open air, on a balcony, and in order to guard against any acci
 dental mistake in the calculations of the analysis, they were all done
 by myself and an assistant conjointly.
     There was but a very slight increase in the carbonic acid expired at
 the two highest stations beyond the amount given out at the seaside,
 and it bore no comparison with the excess of carbonic acid expired at
 a   similar altitude above the       sea  in the Alps.    The mean excess of the
 nected with the    Alpine experiments,   though not with those of Teneriffe, and owing
 to the circumstance that the solution of common salt used, probably contained a
  small quantity of alkaline sulphate, the alkali set free by the action of the barium
  exerted an influence on the titration, apparently increasing the amount of carbonic
  acid present.    Experiments made with three different samples of common salt
  showed me that the error may safely be limited to 3 per cent, and is certainly much
  less in many instances.

 510     Dr. W. Marcet on the Function of Respiration at        [Apr. 24,
two highest stations on Teneriffe, above the amount expired at the sea
side, is only 1.2 per cent, which is so small as to be hardly worth
recording.     In the Alps, at altitudes somewhat corresponding with
 those of the Teneriffe station, but in a much colder climate, the excess
of carbonic acid expired at the highest over the lowest station was
15 per cent, while, if the mean of the four high stations over the
fifth or lower station be taken, it will give an excess of 8.1 per cent.
    In the case of the guide, there is not only no increase of carbonic
acid expired in the high stations, but we find a considerable increase
at the lowest station (above the two others), where the heat felt, and
consequently absorbed, was the greatest; this increase amounts to 17.8
per cent.
   The mean volume of air expired, reduced to 32° and the seaside
pressure, was observed in my case to fall by 14.5 per cent from the
lowest to the highest station.    With the guide there is also a decrease
of air expired under similar circumstances by 16.1 per cent.
   I  find the percentage of carbonic acid in the air expired to increase
in my case from 41 per cent. at the lowest station to 4:9 per cent, at
the highest, while with the guide the proportion of carbonic acid in
the air exhaled is nearly the same at his three stations.
   The frequency of my respiration      undergoes a marked reduction at
the seaside,    though nearly the same at my three high stations; the
reduction amonnts to no less than 31.2 per cent. In the case of the
guide, the mean number of respirations per minute is exactly the same
at his two high stations, but also falls off at the seaside by 25.5 per
cent.
    In all  these experiments  air was breathed through a mouth-piece,
and on that account the rate of breathing was a little slower and
apparently rather deeper than if no mouth-piece had been used. The
same method was pursued in every experiment, so that the results may
be compared with each other with all due regard to strict accuracy.
        Respiration during a Measured Amount of Muscular Exercise.
   In my former communication, Irelated a certain number of experi
ments referring to the increased expiration of carbonic acid while in
the act of ascending.      Since then it occurred to me that an inquiry
into the amount of carbonic acid expired during a well-regulated
walking exercise would yield interesting results. From the difficulty
of regulating exactly the degree of muscular power exerted while
walking, it occurred to me that some arrangement, on the principle of
a tread-wheel, was more likely to answer my purpose, and          I finally
adopted the tread-boards or rocking-boards described at the beginning
of the present communication.      While using these boards we raised     a
weight of 39.5 lbs. forty-five times per minute, as measured by           a
 metronome, to a height of 5.06 inches for every step.

1879.]      Various Altitudes on the Island and Peak                      of  Teneriffe.   511
   Before collecting the air expired, the boards were worked at the
rate of forty-five steps per minute for a short time, in order to bring
the body thoroughly under the conditions of the experiment.
   The 68.4 litre bag connected with the water gauge was held by the
hand in the proper position, and at the same time as the first expira
tion into the bag was commenced a preconcerted signal caused the
assistant to start the time-piece.                A little practice made it quite easy
to  step  in time with the beats of the metronome, counting the number
of expirations.      As soon as the water gauge showed a pressure of one
inch, the watch was stopped and the number of expirations imme
diately recorded.
   The experiment was then completed as usual.
   Six experiments were made by each of us at the different stations,
and the results are entered in the following table:—(See p. 512.)
   On considering in this table the amount of carbonic acid exhaled, it
will be observed to vary but little at the different stations for both
myself and the guide respectively. In my case the amount expired
at 10,700 feet and seaside is nearly                      the same, while there is a
moderate increase at Guajara, the intermediate station.                            In the case
of the   guide   the amount          expired      at the two   highest       stations is much
alike, and there is a moderate decrease at the lower station.
   The proportion between the mean carbonic acid expired sitting
and on the rocking-boards                 for   each  of us respectively at the various
stations were:—

 Consequently,     the proportion of CO2 is a little higher for both of us
at the intermediate station, while the total mean in each case is as
 near as possible identical, and may be safely considered as the same.
These figures show, moreover, that while engaged with the regulated
work on the tread-board, we each of us expired nearly twice as much
carbonic acid as in the sitting posture.
   The mean volume of air expired per minute, reduced, is for myself
considerably smaller at the highest station than at the two others;
while in the case of the guide we observe a slight falling off in the
 volume of air expired at the middle station.
   If  the relation between the volume of air and weight of carbonic
acid expired for each of us at all the stations be calculated, it will be
found that for myself 1 grim. of carbonic acid (expired on the tread

creased at the middle station, undergoing a marked and sudden     reduc
tion at the seaside.
          Water Expired from the Lungs at the Various Stations.
    The third part of my paper refers to the moisture exhaled.
    It was apparent at the outset that a falling off in the atmospheric
pressure, from rising above the sea, would be attended with a corre
sponding increase of evaporation from the lungs, and a proportional
cooling effect on the respiratory organs. The apparatus used for the
inquiry was disposed as follows:–
    A tube  drawn out at both ends was loosely filled with fragments of
calcic chloride; it was large enough to ensure the absorption of
the whole of the vapour expired in three minutes.        One end of the
tube was connected with one of my large india-rubber bags, while the
other end had a ring of vulcanised india-rubber fixed round, to which
the mouth was applied. A delicate spring valve (by Coxeter) was
fitted into the neck of the tube next the bag, and was weighed with
the tube; it effectually prevented any admission of air into the tube
except that given out from the lungs. Either the tube or the bag
was placed in communication with a water gauge by a neck and india
rubber tubing. Every now and then the calcic chloride was tested as
to its power of retaining all the moisture; this was done by con
necting another similar tube with it and weighing it after breathing
through    them both.    No mouthpiece was used in these experiments,
as moisture was found to deposit on anything interposed between the
mouth and tube.        The air breathed was inspired through the nose
 only while the whole of the air expired was driven through the
 tube, the nose being kept closed with the thumb and index.     I  found
no difficulty in doing this with accuracy; great care was taken
to keep the saliva from flowing into the tube together with the
air expired.     Except in the case of a few experiments at the sufmmit
of the Peak,     I alone submitted myself to this part of the inquiry.
The experiments were made by series of usually three at a time, the
figures given in my table are the means of those of the different
series.
    The numbers actually obtained gave, of course, the weight of the
moisture evaporated from the lungs, together with that of the atmo
spheric humidity of the air exhaled; a correction had, therefore, to be
made.    I  determined the atmospheric humidity by means of dry and
wet bulb   thermometers,   and the corresponding weight of moisture in
a given bulk of air was taken from Glaisher's hygrometrical tables
(fifth edition).
    The results from these experiments have been condensed in the
following table:—

 cent.   The volume of air expired in the    case  of the guide exhibits a
 similar change, amounting to 22.6 per cent., but the decrease stops at
 Guajara, the intermediate station.        The total mean volume of air
 expired per minute, at every station (the foot of the cone excepted),
 while in a sitting posture, was for myself 5:36 litres, and for the guide
 6.75 litres.
    8. The percentage of carbonic acid in the air expired exhibits
 nearly the same changes on the Island of Teneriffe as in the Alps.
 At Teneriffe it rose from 41 per cent. at the seaside to 4.9 per cent.
 at 11,945 feet, while, in the Alps, the proportion had varied from
 3.8 per cent. at 1,230 feet to 4.7 per cent. (St. Bernard) at 9,403
feet. If the total mean proportion of carbonic acid in the air expired,
reduced, for the three stations of Alta Vista, Guajara, and Puerto be
calculated, it will be found to amount, for myself, to 4.4 per cent. and
for the guide to 4.6 per cent., or to be nearly the same. The mean
from the eighty-nine experiments        I  made in the Alps, in the sitting
posture, yielded 42 per cent. of carbonic acid expired.
   9. The frequency of the expirations fell considerably in both cases
at the seaside, or increased on rising above the sea, but was much the
same for each of us respectively at the different stations on the Peak.
The reduction at the seaside, from the mean frequency of respiration
at the upper stations, amounted for myself to 31.2 per cent., and for
the guide to 25.5 per cent. In the Alps there had been a somewhat
gradual rise of the frequency of the respirations between the lowest
and highest stations, equal in my case to 34.9 per cent.
   10. While raising with the feet a weight of 39.5 lbs. to an elevation
of 5.06 inches forty-five times per minute, we both expired the least
amount of carbonic acid at the lowest station, and the most at the
intermediate    station, 7,090 feet high.    The fluctuation between the
various stations was much the same for each of us respectively,
although the actual amount expired by each of us differed in a
marked degree.        The mean relation for both of us respectively,
between the carbonic acid expired sitting and on the rocking-boards,
was found to be the same, and a trifle over twice the weight of the
carbonic acid expired sitting.
   The volume of air breathed while at work was decidedly less in my
case at Alta Vista than at the two lower stations, with the guide there
was a falling off in the air expired at Guajara.     The mean volume of
air  expired  per minute,  in all the experiments  on the rocking-boards,
was for myself 11:56 litres, and for the guide 13.95 litres.
   The general result obtained, with reference to this subject, was that
the relation between the volumes of air expired while sitting, and
while engaged with a regulated amount of muscular work, was the
same as the relation     found to exist between the weights of carbonic
 acid  expired  under such circumstances, and moreover that these pro

    As to the frequency of        the respiration,        while at work      on the  rocking
boards, it was the greatest with me at the highest station, and with
the guide at the intermediate station; in both cases it was the lowest
at the seaside. The mean frequency amounted, in my case, to 12.4
per minute against 10:2 sitting, giving a relation of 1:22; or for
1 respiration (expiration) sitting,                  I    took 1:22 respiration on the
tread-board.      With the guide, the corresponding figures were 11:0
against 9:7, and the relation 1:13; so that for 1 respiration sitting,
the guide took 1:13 respiration on the tread-board.                            His breathing
 while   taking muscular      exercise      was,   therefore,     relatively   rather slower
than mine had been under similar circumstances.
    11. The results obtained from the determination of the water expired,
or evaporated from the lungs and air-passages, show distinctly that
the moisture exhaled increases as a person rises above the sea. On
the Island of Teneriffe, where the temperature in the shade is com
paratively high, even at great altitudes, there is a tendency to the
degree of evaporation being in an inverse ratio to the atmospheric
pressure.
    It is very obvious that this increased evaporation as altitude increased
 must have caused a corresponding loss of heat, or cooling of the
 lungs and air-passages;            I  felt this very much at night, when the
 temperature of the air        frequently       fell below freezing outside my tent.
 Of course, no number of blankets on our beds could check that source
of cold.
    The amount of water evaporated from my lungs and air-passages
during twelve hours of daytime, calculated from the above data,
would be—

              At Puerto      (seaside). .             - -      131.7       ,
    The correction to      be   applied from the moisture present in the air
breathed increased, of course, very much at the seaside, where it
formed a considerable proportion of the moisture actually present in
the air expired.

June, 1877 (vol. xxvi, pp. 314, 346).
  The first of these communications was devoted to the consideration
of the quantitative determination of sugar for physiological                          purposes.
Some important physiological conclusions had been drawn by Bernard
from the results obtained through a modified method introduced by
him of employing Fehling's solution.                   I
                                            pointed out the manner in

which considered the process in question to be open to fallacy, and
showed that the results yielded by it differed to a marked extent from

copper test.
     I
     have since continued my investigations, and have now results to
bring forward obtained by another process, which described in a com        I
munication read at the Royal Society, January 16, 1879, and published
in the “Proceedings,” vol. xxviii, p. 260. This process does not differ
in principle of action from Bernard's, and if there were no fallacy in
either case involved, the results yielded by the two should agree. In
both the reduction of the oxide of copper is made to occur without
the precipitation of the reduced oxide, so that the change to be watched
in the action of the test is a progressive decoloration, unobscured by
the presence of any deposit.     In Bernard's process this result is
brought about by the action of potash in a concentrated form upon the
organic matter incidentally present in the product prepared for exami

    The figures in the next two columns represent the results given by
the same two         processes     of analysis applied to the product obtained after
the plan adopted for the gravimetric process. The blood is treated
with sulphate of soda, filtered, the coagulum thoroughly washed to
extract all the sugar, and the filtrate and washings brought to a known
völume.
    The last column furnishes the mean of two gravimetric analyses
carried out upon two portions of the blood distinct from that employed
for the analyses in columns 3 and 4.

     On looking at the results the first point to which attention may be
 directed is that evidence is supplied showing that reliance cannot be
 placed upon the formula adopted by Bernard for calculating the volume
 of liquid derivable from the weight of blood taken for analysis. The
 figures in columns 3 and 4 were drawn from direct observation, and if
 the formula supplied correct information, the results in columns 1 and
 3 and 2 and 4 should respectively coincide.                     It is noticeable, however,
 that whilst in some instances             they   approach    closely   towards agreement,
 in others there is a pretty wide divergence.
     In the second place it is seen that the results obtained by the method
 of analysis involving the employment of the potash stand considerably
 higher than those yielded by the ammoniated form of the test. It
 may be assumed that in the action of the potash on the incidental
 organic matter present to give rise to the required condition for main

taining the suboxide in the dissolved state, a reducing substance
becomes developed, or else that the amount of oxide of copper appro
priated to the oxidation of the sugar becomes altered in the presence
of the large amount of potash which it is necessary to employ.
   Lastly, it may be observed that a close conformity exists between
the figures in columns 4 and      5.   The results obtained by the gravi
metric method are thus confirmed by the volumetric results obtained
by means of the ammoniated form of the cupric test. Seeing that
separately prepared specimens of the respective samples of blood were
submitted to the two kinds of analysis, the conformity is certainly
striking, and gives strong weight to the validity of the results yielded
by the gravimetric method.
   One of the points referred     to in my second communication * is the
spontaneous disappearance of      sugar from the blood after withdrawal
from the body.      It is a part  of Bernard's doctrine that the natural
seat of destruction of sugar       within the system is in the systemic
capillaries, and if it can be shown that an active disappearance of
sugar occurs in the blood after removal from the vessels, support is
given to his proposition.      I  cited the observation which has been
adduced by Bernard to illustrate that a marked aptitude exists for the
disappearance of sugar under the circumstances named. According to
this observation, a reduction from 1:070 to 0.880 parts per 1,000
occurred during the first half-hour, and at the end of 24 hours the
analytical result obtained is represented as standing thus—0.000.            I
stated that my own experience furnished evidence of a widely different
nature, and introduced the figures yielded by five observations in proof
of this assertion.
   The gravimetric process is only suited for the examination of blood
before decomposition has set in, as the result would be vitiated
by the presence of ammonia as a product of decomposition, the effect
being an interference with the deposition of the cuprous oxide. With
the ammoniated cupric test, however, any state is suitable; and since
my communication of June 21st, 1877, was published,             I have applied
this process, as well as Bernard's potash process, to blood which has
been kept for lengthened periods, instead of limiting the examination,
as I had previously done, to the first twenty-four hours.          The results
obtained were quite unlooked for, and quite irreconcileable with the
representation in Bernard's      observation, which has been referred to,
that at the end of twenty-four hours the blood             ceased to give any
indication of the presence of sugar.
   I have before   me a large amount     of recorded experience, but need
only select a few illustrative examples, for the information supplied is
of the same nature throughout.        In no case, although the blood had
acquired a highly offensive character from putrefaction, has it failed to

exercise a decided amount of reducing power over the copper test. It
will be seen in the succeeding observations that there is a period during
the first few days when the reducing power undergoes a pretty sudden
fall, and that it afterwards remains nearly stationary.    the reducing                             If
action is to be attributedto sugar, and sugar only, it would have to be
said that sugar can exist in a mass of putrefied blood without under
going destruction.   It seems to me, and this view is supported by
evidence to be presently adduced derivable from the addition of sugar
to decomposing  blood, that there is another reducing substance present
besides sugar which is not affected in a similar manner by contiguous
decomposition.    The period of sudden fall, it appears, may be taken
as corresponding with the disappearance of sugar, and this, it will be
noticed, presents a variation within certain limits. In the observations
at the top of the list the period is more prolonged than in those lower
down. It is possible that this may have arisen from the atmosphere of
the laboratory having become influenced by the presence of decom
posing samples of blood.
  The earlier observations were conducted with the application of
Bernard's process only, as it was not until June, 1878, that began to                                      I
apply the ammoniated cupric liquid. In the employment of this liquid
the same product prepared from the blood was used as for Bernard's
mode of testing.    It is noticeable that the results yielded by the two
processes differ from each other in the manner that has been already
commented upon.

  In  the following series of experiments sugar was added to blood at
ifferent periods after withdrawal. The results furnish the same kind
f evidence as that obtained through the previous observations. A
marked descent is noticeable in the reducing power until a certain
oint is attained, after which but little change occurs, however long
he blood may be kept, and however putrid it may become.                                       It seems,
herefore, as already suggested, that there is a reducing agent in the
lood which comports itself differently from sugar.                                   If the reducing
ction were due      solely to   sugar,        it is not          intelligible       that there should
e a more or less sharp descent to a certain point, and then that

the condition should remain comparatively                              stationary.          There is no
reason that the last        portion    of   sugar         should behave                differently   from
the first. Something having a reducing power, on the other hand,
appears to exist which possesses a stability greater than that enjoyed
by sugar, and which, thus resisting the influence of the changes of
decomposition, produced the reducing effect on the test exerted by the
blood after keeping for thirty days.

  In     a  further series of experiments, blood with added sugar was
ubjected       to the influence of a current of different gases.                                         I   was
iesirous of ascertaining if oxygen promoted the disappearance of sugar,
ind counterpart observations were made with carbonic acid and hydro
ren.      The results obtained afford no evidence of any chemical action
»eing exerted.         Whatever slight effect occurred,                                  I    think, may be
issumed to have arisen from increased molecular action excited by the
ransit of the gas.

   The following conclusions may be expressed as constituting the
issue of the results recorded in this communication:
    That the results bearing on the physiology of sugar in relation to
the blood derived from the application of the gravimetric process, and
given in my former communication to the Royal Society (vol. xxvi,
p. 346), are confirmed by those yielded by the ammoniated cupric
test, described by me in the “Proceedings,” vol. xxviii, p. 260.
     That the disappearance of sugar from the blood after withdrawal
from the system takes place in the gradual manner that might be
expected from the effect of ordinary decomposition, and presents
nothing to support any conclusion regarding the destruction of sugar
in the blood
          -      as   a physiological              phenomenon.
                                                                                              2   Q  2

   That there appears to exist a reducing substance besides sugar in
the blood which is of a sufficiently stable character to resist the effects
of advanced putrefaction.       Expressed as sugar, it amounts to from
 200 to 300 per 1,000.        These figures, therefore, would appear to
require to be deducted from those which have been given as repre
senting the amount of sugar present in the blood.
   That the passage of a current of oxygen through the blood does not
exert any appreciable effect in the direction of oxidation of the sugar.

        OBITUARY        NOTICES     OF FELLOWS        DECEASED.
    THE REv. WILLIAM BRANWHITE CLARKE was born 2nd June, 1798, at
East Bergholt, county of Suffolk, and educated partly in his father's
house, under the Rev. R. G. Suckling Browne, B.D., a distinguished
Hebrew scholar, and Fellow of Dulwich College, and partly at Dedham
Grammar School; he entered into residence at Jesus College, Cam
bridge, in October, 1817. He took his degree in January, 1821, and
in 1824 became M.A.
    In May, 1821, he received deacon's orders from Dr. Bathurst,
 Bishop of Norwich, and priest's orders in May, 1823.
    From May, 1821, to November, 1824, he was trained as curate at
 Ramsholt, at Nedging and Whatfield, at Chellesworth and Brantham,
 and then in his native parish.     He took advantage of his rector's per
 mission to travel every year, and thus laid the foundation of practical
 application of the geological and mineralogical lessons he had received
 at the University, under Professor Sedgwick and Dr. E. Clarke, the
 great traveller.    He made a personal examination of the most cele
 brated formations of Europe.       He travelled extensively in England
 and Wales and on the Continent from 1820 to 1839, not omitting a
 single year. He thus visited the Lake District, the Isle of Man,
 Staffordshire,   Derbyshire, North Wales, the chalk and oolite of York
 shire and   Lincolnshire, the chalk of Sussex and Normandy, the central
 and southern parts of France, the Alps and North of Italy, the Nether
 lands,   Rhenish provinces, Prussia, Belgium, the Ardennes, the
 tertiary districts of Nassau, the volcanic districts of the Rhine and
 Moselle.    In 1829 he completed his survey of the counties of Suffolk,
 Norfolk, and Essex. In 1830 he visited the chalk districts and older
 formations of the frontiers of France and Belgium.        Then followed
 Dorsetshire, West of England, Isle of Wight, Sussex, South
 west of England, the coal beds of the Boulonnais, the North of
 France, the Channel Islands and Isle of Portland, the new red sandstone
 of Staffordshire, Cheshire, and Lancashire, the Silurian old red sand
 stone and coal districts of Shropshire, Herefordshire, Monmouthshire,
 and South Wales.
    In 1830 and 1831 he was present during many of the stirring scenes
 of the Belgian War of Independence and the last siege of Antwerp.;
 at which time also he made the acquaintance of the lady who soon
 after became his wife, a daughter of Dr. Stather, a gentleman of
    WOL. XXVIII.                                               Q,

                                    ii
position in the Island of Nevis.       This lady, with a son and two
daughters, survives him.
   In  1833 he was presented to a small vicarage near Poole, where in
addition to his clerical duties he discharged the functions of a magis
trate.   His ardour in pursuit of travel and geology exposed him to a
severe illness which culminated in rheumatic fever, which so crippled
him that he was induced in 1839 to try the effects of a warmer climate,
and as the investigation of a new country had peculiar charms, he
resolved to visit the colony of New South Wales, which in those days
included what are now Victoria and Queensland.       He had also a kind
of special mission from his brother geologists to investigate the
carboniferous formation of Australia. . The ship in which he was
making the voyage touched at the Cape of Good Hope, and Mr. Clarke
seized the opportunity of making a survey of and report upon the
geology about Cape Town.       From the time he landed in Australia, in
1859, to the day of his death, he never ceased pushing forward his
researches into the unknown regions which lay before him.       It is no
exaggeration to state that he knew every inch of the greater part of
New South Wales proper, and from constant investigation of reports
by explorers and others he knew the general character and geography,
almost topography, of Australasia.
   The modest income which is supposed to be the lot of those who
undertake the duties of a clergyman, and which in the case of
Mr. Clarke, averaged, up to 1861, less than £200 per annum, in
clusive of the grant of £1,000 made in recognition of his services,
prevented his issuing well illustrated works.   Most of his publications
appeared in a very modest form, either as Parliamentary papers,
newspaper letters, or as papers in the various scientific journals.
Latterly, the Government Printing Office offered some relief from
the expense of publication, and the last edition of his last work is
creditable to that establishment.   The Government always had a high
appreciation of his services, and never failed when in difficulties to
utilise his knowledge.     Thus in 1851, when the Government wished
to have a proper report upon the mineral resources of the country, no
fitter person could be found. The neighbouring colonies also appealed
to Mr. Clarke upon all matters of a geological nature.    His name was
in fact a “household word ” all over Australasia.
   It is proved beyond controversy that he ascertained the auriferous
nature of the country in 1841, ten years before the popular date of
1851.    The main conclusions at which Mr. Clarke arrived from his
geological investigations were, that matrix gold was the thing to be
looked for, and that the carboniferous deposits of the main seams
in New South Wales were Palaeozoic.
   To a geologist of Europe, with libraries of reference in every city,
and with rapid means of locomotion and comfortable quarters every

                                      iii
where, the difficulties of Australian geology are not apparent.     When
Mr. Clarke set out on his explorations there was no other means of
travel but horses, with pack-horses for provisions, tents, and instru
ments.     In some parts of the country there were no roads or land
marks of any kind, and the maps of the district were nearly useless,
as being only skeleton outlines of boundaries.        He had to carry on
his work single-handed, and gradually to form his own library.
   Mr. Clarke's travels extended to Tasmania, Victoria, and Queens
land, and he has written various exhaustive reports relating to these
countries.    His writings have guided persons to various profitable
gold mines, and the successful tin industries of Australia and
Tasmania have been commenced from indications furnished by him.
   In 1863 the Legislature of New South Wales voted Mr. Clarke
383,000, at a time when his various ailments seemed coming to a head,
to enable him to secure a little comfort in his old age; but since that
time his “pen of a ready writer” has never been weary; and we are
almost tempted to say that his latter years have surpassed the former, for
his facts seemed to have accumulated more quickly, and his experience
being, of course, more matured, enabled him to seize upon the more
salient points of the geology of the country. The fruit of his labours
during this part of his life consists of a geological map of the whole
colony, which has been compiled from his note-books and memoranda.
 Up to 1870 he never ceased from the work of his sacred calling, even
 when on his explorations; but on 1st October of that year, his in
creasing infirmities obliged him to retire from his parochial labours.
 He was thus in a position to avail himself of the improved locomotion
afforded by the railways to revisit his old haunts, and to visit other
 places of interest, so as to fill up gaps in his former works.
     He was an indefatigable observer of meteorological facts and of
 general natural history.
    Mr. Clarke was elected F.G.S. in 1826.      He was   a member   of the
 Geological Society of France, and held a diploma from the        Imperial
 and Royal Geological Institution of Austria, F.R.G.S., and one of the
 early Fellows of the Zoological Society.
    Mr. Clarke contributed largely to the periodical literature of
 England prior to 1839, and his poetical effusions are by no means un
 deserving of praise.
    In 1876 he was elected F.R.S., and in 1877 he was awarded the
 Murchison Medal of the Geological Society of London. The terms in
 which the award was made express the results of his geological
 labours in Australia.
    The excessive heat of March, 1878, combined with the labour of
 preparing a new edition of “Sedimentary Formations of New South
 Wales,” proved too much for Mr. Clarke's strength.         He was seized
 with paralysis on the 16th of that month; and though he rallied, so

that he was able to move about without help, and to arrange and
label fossils received from Professor de Koninck on the 15th June, he
was seized with a violent pain in the heart on the morning of the
16th, and before medical aid could be procured he was called to his
long-earned     rest.
    It is  proposed    by the Government to purchase his collection of
minerals, fossils, library, and geological maps, and with them to form
a nucleus, under the name of the “Clarke Collection,” of a grand
Mining Museum.
   ADOLPHE     THEODORE     BRONGNIART,     son of the illustrious Alexandre
Brongniart, and grandson of Théodore Brongniart, an eminent archi
tect, was born at Paris on the 14th January, 1801.            Educated for the
medical profession, he soon gave up that career in order to devote
himself, under his father's guidance, to scientific pursuits, and early
took a place among the first living botanists.          In his nineteenth year
he published his first and only zoological paper, containing the descrip
tion of Limnadia, a new genus of Crustacea.           In the following year he
established the   genus   Ceratopteris for a curious and anomalous aquatic
fern.    In his twenty-first year he published his first palaeontological
memoir on the classification and distribution of fossil plants.             He
reviewed, in this paper, the various plant-remains then known, and
grouped them in 4 classes and 19 genera. This memoir has been
described as the starting point of the intelligent study of fossil plants.
From this beginning Brongniart continued his labours and expounded
the fragmentary remains of extinct floras, and traced their relation to
living plants, and their position in the vegetable kingdom. He was
singularly fitted for this work, for he already had an extensive ac
quaintance with the structure and classification of living plants, and
he had so digested his knowledge that he was able to utilize it in the
study of these obscure fossils.          Seldom has a man made a more
brilliant début than     Adolphe  Brongniart.      The memoir on the classifi
cation and distribution of fossil plants, and another, which threw an
entirely new light on the subject of the fertilization of living plants,
were already finished, if not published, when he was about twenty-four
years of age.
    The study of the reproduction of organic beings had, up to his
time, made so little progress that Brongniart obtained little assistance
from previous workers. Without committing himself to any of the
 theories which had been suggested in explanation of the processes of
 fertilization, he confined himself to the observation and arrangement of
 facts.   “Il est  certains sujets,” he says, “dont la difficulté &loigne et
 rebute les observateurs, tandis que la grandeur de leurs conséquences
 excite au plus haut degré l'imagination           des hommes disposés à se
 contenter d'une      hypothèse.   Quant à     moi, j'ai cherché d'abord à les

oublier toutes,         a     réunir     des     à déduire de leur com
                                                  faits bien observés,
paraison des conclusions de détail, et à former du rapprochement de
celles-ciune théorie propre à les représenter.”
  Brongniart showed how the embryo is formed, little by little, by a
process which he did not hesitate to say is identical over the whole
of the vegetable kingdom. Microscopically small plants, the most
majestic trees of our forests, our cultivated plants,    are reproduced                        all
by one and the same process.
   For some years Brongniart prosecuted his investigations          living                                      of
plants, and published, between 1824 and 1827,       new classification               a                                 of
fungi,   amemoir               on
                      the natural order Bruniaceae, and several histo
logical and physiological memoirs. The labours and observations                                                        of
six   years     in    Palaeontology were exhibited                                   his “Prodrome d'une

time    his first investigation only few and imperfect specimens had
         of
been obtained.    Fifty years later his friends, Messieurs Renault and
Grand d'Eury,   sent him, from the environs      Autun and St. Etienne,    of
a    quantity      of   specimens              of
                                        which had been converted into
                                                    seeds

From these masses Brongniart separated transparent flakes, and, by
the aid   ofthe microscope, made out minute details          their organiza                of

                                      vi
that    we should one day see in the substance of a hard and translucent
stone indications of the    sap   which had, in former ages, circulated
in the delicate vessels of a living plant, of the grains of pollen burst
ing from the anthers, and of the presence of the minute ovules
where appearing.      In his memoir on this subject, the last he ever
published, Brongniart not only disclosed the evidence of a remarkable
and varied gymnospermous vegetation in Carboniferous times, but the
structure preserved in these Palaeozoic plants led him to suspect the
existence of a curious and hitherto unobserved detail in the organiza
tion of the ovule of living Gymnosperms.            After having satisfac
torily shown that the beautifully silicified tissues of the plants of
St. Etienne belonged to plants of which we find analogous species in
Mexico, he confidently asserted that a peculiarity, a cavity for the
reception of the pollen, never previously observed in living specimens,
would be found in the species of that country, and he subsequently
had the satisfaction of exhibiting, to the Académie Française, some
plants living in the hothouses of the Museum which had a pollen
cavity of which a plant dead countless ages ago had furnished us with
the first example.
    Brongniart did not live to complete this important research. The
decline of his health first manifested itself in a failure of sight brought
 on by excessive use of the microscope, and he owed it to the assistance
of his friends and colleagues, Messieurs Bureau, Cornu, Renault,
 Grand d'Eury, and other friends, that he was able to work on at the
 investigation as long as he did. From the time of the siege of Paris
 his health, affected by the privations and sufferings he then underwent,
 steadily declined, but he retained to the end of his life his tranquillity
 of mind, his intellect, and his memory.         He took an affectionate
 interest in the  progress  of a grandson,   whose first steps in the career
of science he hoped to guide. At length, in February, 1876, fore
 seeing that his end was near, he desired to be surrounded by his
 family, and expired in the arms of his eldest son.
    Less fortunate than his father, Adolphe Brongniart had, some years
 previously, lost the affectionate wife whom he had married in early
life. He left two sons and several grand-children.
    The herbarium left by A. Brongniart has been placed in the
 Botanical Gallery (of Paris), and his unique and beautiful collection
 of fossil plants forms one of its greatest ornaments.
    Brongniart was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences in
 1834, in the place of Desfontaines, and in the same year he was
 appointed Professor of Vegetable Physiology in the Museum of
 Natural History. In 1840 he was appointed a foreign member of the
 Geological Society of London, and in the following year he received
 the Wollaston Medal, in consideration of his important works on
 fossil   plants. In  1852  he was     elected a foreign    member of    the

                                                   vii
Royal Society, and was also appointed Inspector-General                                    for Science
of the University of Paris.
  With regard to his scientific character, Brongniart has                                 been   charac
terized as the Linnaeus of fossil botany; not so much a great discoverer
as a great systematizer; introducing lucid order and general principles
into the study of the materials which had been already collected. To
those materials, also, he undoubtedly added much by his own observa
tions, and probably (as in the case of Linnaeus) his example gave a
stimulus to the exertions of his opponents as well as of his followers.
He was eminent, not only for industry, accuracy, and judgment, but
also for the clearness and             his scientific writings.
                                        neatness of
   Brongniart's favourite              study is one in which exceed

ingly rapid progress has              since he was at the height of his
                                        been made,
fame, and in which rapid               still making.
                                        progress is     The researches of
Heer, Unger, Ettingshausen, and others, in the fossil plants of the
Tertiaries, have opened to us almost entirely new departments of
Palaeo-botany; the microscopic studies, which have been followed up
with so much zeal and success by some in our own country, have
thrown a greater amount of new light on the structure of the Palaeo
zoic vegetation.  But the name of Adolphe Brongniart deserves to be
held in honour as long as the sciences of botany and geology are
cultivated; and, however far the knowledge of these subjects may be
carried, such works as his treatise on the structure of Sigillaria must
always be valued as models of accurate examination, lucid exposition,
and caution in drawing conclusions.
   Adolphe Brongniart's careful investigation and illustration of the
veining of recent ferns   (see his “Histoire des Végétaux Fossiles,”
vol.   i.,   p.
           148) probably suggested some                          of
                                            the more recent methods

became necessary to close the school at Wexio, which Fries attended,
and he remained for a time at home. He made use of this period of
leisure to describe all the Fungi he could find, and before 1811 he had
succeeded in distinguishing three or four hundred species, but not
having access to books on the subject, he gave them temporary names.
  In       he left the Gymnasium, and went to the University of
        1811
Lund. At Lund he continued to give all his spare time to Botany,
and had the satisfaction of finding many plants new to him. He spent
much of his time in the library studying botanical works, in which he
found the names of many of the species he had described. While at
Lund he was fortunate enough to make the acquaintance of two dis
tinguished naturalists, Retzius and Agardh, who put into his hands
the mycological works of Persoon and Albertini, the best then existing.
During the year 1812 he studied Hypodermia (Ustilagineae, AEcido
mycetes).  While earnestly studying for the degree of Doctor of
Philosophy he still found some leisure for his favourite pursuit. He
took the degree of Ph.D. in 1814, and was also in this year appointed
Docens of Botany.                 In 1819 he became “Adjunkt” and received the
title of Professor in           1834.   .
   From the time of taking his degree Fries devoted himself to the
study of the Fungi, and went with this view for a time to Copenhagen.
About the year 1814 he brought out his earliest important work, his
“Novitiae Florae Sueciae;” and his “Observationes Mycologicae” was
published, in the years 1815–1818, at Copenhagen. In 1814 he began
to write his “Monographia Pyrenomycetum Sueciae,” which work he
presented in parts from 1816 to 1819 to the Academy of Sciences, in                              .
Stockholm.
  In   the year 1816, having come to the conclusion that the method of
tlescribing and classifying hitherto adopted was by no means satisfac
tory, Fries began to work out a new system and to make fresh
investigations of           all
                       the Fungi. This new system was based upon
                         their different stages
                                             development, and
                                                                                            of of a

appeared     in
             1830.                                                                     -
  In  1828 Fries published his “Elenchus Fungorum,”        which                    in      he
described some    the Fungi,
                         of     which great quantities had been sent
                                             of

  After the publication, in 1829, of the third volume of his “Systema
Mycologicum,” he again subjected the Fungi to a close investigation,
comparing them with his own descriptions.      Having thus revised and
completed            his observations,            separated          the Discomycetes                  from       the
Hymenomycetes, &c., he published                              the results of his observations                      in
his “Flora Scanica ” in 1835.
    Fries        Demonstrator in Botany at the University of Lund
              became
in 1828. In 1834 he was translated to the University of Upsala as
Professor of Rural Economy, with which, after the death of Professor
Wahlenberg in 1851, the chair of Botany was united.     He discharged
these teaching duties until 1859, when he retired on a pension.
   At Upsala he found new fields for his mycological studies, and
published his “Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici sen Synopsis Hymeno
mycetum ” in 1836–1838.
   In the year 1844 the Academy of Science in Stockholm resolved to

sidered to be of the greatest value for the study of the plants of
northern Europe.       This collection of typical plants is quoted by Fries
throughout the first part of his “Summa Vegetabilium Scandinaviae.”
    Fries has also written treatises on Agriculture and on Practical
Botany, on the Nomenclature           of Plants, and on the History of
Botany.        In the “Botanical   Excursions,”    1852–1864, he has very
successfully popularised his science, and the book has been read with
lively interest beyond his own country.
    Important, however, as were many of Fries' labours on Phaenogamic
plants and Lichens, his future fame must rest upon his reformation of
Fungology. The brilliant discoveries of later observers seem at first
sight to eclipse altogether what was done so many years before, but
they are quite in a different line, and doubtless have been assisted by
the labours of Fries. His arrangement of the genus Agaricus alone
has been described as a great effort of genius, and every division of
his mycological system is full of matter for reflection. To appreciate
his system, full allowance must be made for the state in which he
found mycology and the comparative imperfection of microscopes.
    Fries was eminent as a systematic botanist, and the Friesian system
 is still followed by some Swedish writers.        The system was first pub
 lished in the “Flora   Scanica,”   1835), and an outline of it will be found
 in Lindley's “Vegetable Kingdom.”
    With regard to the relationship of     species, his point of view appears
 to have been the same as that taken       by Linnaeus, “A species is each
 form brought forth by the Creator in the beginning.”
     Fries had remarkable fluency and power of expression both in
 writing and lecturing, and this faculty no doubt contributed much to
 his influence in gathering round him a large number of disciples.
 Foreign scientific men seldom visited Upsala during the last forty
 years of his life without making the acquaintance of the celebrated
 botanist, whose amiable and engaging manners and kind disposition
 made him beloved by all who knew him.
     Fries continued his scientific labours into the last years of his life.
  In his eightieth year he published a new and improved edition of his
  extensive work “Hymenomycetes Europaei,” and about a week before
  his death he completed an essay for a foreign periodical.        He died on
  the evening of the 8th of February, 1878, to the last actively useful.
     In 1851, Fries had been appointed Director of the Botanical
  Museum and garden attached to the University of Upsala, and in 1853
  became Rector of the University.       He was a member of many learned
  societies, Swedish and foreign.      In 1835 he was elected a Foreign
  Member of the Linnaean Society, and in 1875, a Foreign Member             of
  the Royal Society.
